00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever fallen prey to one
of those get-rich-quick schemes

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:84%
only to find that it didn't
work and what you really

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:90%
got was poor quick?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, my guest
today, Derek Rydall,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
is an expert in the
law of emergence.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says it's not
about getting rich at all.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.615 align:middle line:84%
It's about how can you
really achieve something

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that you already have
to emerge within you?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DEREK RYDALL: It's
good to be here.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just used
money as an example

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.417 align:middle line:84%
because it's something that
so many people look to get.

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
a really great way

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to start this conversation
about the law of emergence,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
because how can you
really have something

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.635 align:middle line:90%
emerge from you that is money?

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can talk a little about
what is the law of emergence.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.325 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And basically,
the law of emergence, it's

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the idea that everything
is already within you.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
of it like the way

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that an oak tree is
already in the acorn.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And the acorn doesn't have
to go out and attract an oak

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:84%
or achieve an oak
or become worthy

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
of an oak or
deserving of an oak.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
But when the acorn surrenders
to the soil and the conditions

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
within the soil become
a match for that seed

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
pattern within the
acorn, then that which

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.169 align:middle line:84%
is already inherent
in it emerges.

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:90%
The oak is already there.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't have
to try to the be a tree.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It doesn't
have to try to be a tree.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.121 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And that same principle
that we see in all of nature

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:90%
is a principal that is in us.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk a little
bit about my story

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and how I kind of discovered
this and how it's not

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
a principle I made
up, but it's something

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.774 align:middle line:84%
that I codified in a way that we
can understand it and practice

00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
it, because that's what all
the great masters have taught,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
which is that there's
nothing out there to get.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
This world can't
add anything to you.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But it also can't
take anything away.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
great secrets we're

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about, I hope.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.495 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: But that
it's all within you.

00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did you come
about all of this information?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.541 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about your past,

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:90%
because it's very relatable.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, you
know, like so many people

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I was on a path of trying to
improve myself and get over

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
my heartbreaks and breakups and
breakdowns and bad childhood.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And after years of
self-improvement therapy,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that I
improved was my ability

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.414 align:middle line:84%
to very eloquently articulate
why I was so messed up.

00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: I could describe
with the best of them

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
every little reason
why I was so messed up.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:90%
But I was still a basket case.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Messed up.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And
interestingly, this

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
drive to improve myself
drove me ultimately to drink.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It made me addicted
to drugs and alcohol,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:84%
because the more I
tried to improve myself

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
from this place of feeling
broken and separate and lost,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
the more it exacerbated
those feelings.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
You were trying to numb
yourself from that?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Eventually I had
to, because the pain of that--

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain why that
happens and so many of us

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:90%
experience that.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, I
had an experience

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:90%
where I almost drowned.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was stuck in
a reef, underwater,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by giant spikes
of coral and fire coral

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
everywhere that's like
the equivalent of 1,000

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
jellyfish stings.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.548 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: I was
surrounded by this.

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been caught
in this pocket.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I'd gone underwater diving.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And my prayer was to get lost.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I was on a shoot for a film.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.069 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a very dark place.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, be careful
what you pray for,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:90%
because I got lost.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And at some moment in
this pocket of coral where

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.635 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally having to breathe
in short staccato breaths,

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:44.835 align:middle line:84%
you know, like [BREATHING
 QUICKLY AND SHALLOWLY],

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.251 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't breathe too
deeply or I would have been

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
skewered by these spikes--

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You had a tank?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: I didn't, no.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I was like diving where
you have a snorkel then you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:90%
deep-dive and you come back up.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'd gotten into this pocket
where I was about this far

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
under the water, but giant
spikes all underneath me.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
where the exit was.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.935 align:middle line:84%
It looked like an
underwater booby trap

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:90%
tomb in an Indiana Jones movie.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was there for a long time.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And my mind went through
all the scenarios

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.099 align:middle line:84%
of how was I going to get out,
how was I going to escape,

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:90%
who would come rescue me.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew I was there.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the
point where I was

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
no longer afraid of drowning.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was going to.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to explain
what that moment is.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But the ego had gone through
all of its scenarios,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
even imagining becoming famous
posthumously as an actor.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Like it's just going
anywhere to try

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:90%
to get out of the situation.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And finally I realized,
I'm going to drown.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that
was left was to surrender.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't-- I had already
tried to negotiate with

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
the universe, you know, God,
if you get me out of this,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll go to church on
Sunday kind of thing.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All of this happened
within a couple of minutes?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: No.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
This was a longer
period of time.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I was stuck under
there for a while.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting to
hyperventilate and maybe

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:90%
even hallucinate.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that all
there was to let go.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
It was that moment of
complete surrender.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment of
complete surrender-- and this

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
all happened super-quick--
something cracked open.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I could see suddenly,
like your whole life flashing

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
before you, that my whole
identity of who I thought I was

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and what I had had trying to be
to escape in my life, all that

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:90%
was just a fictional character.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
literally, this wave

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
came along and lifted me out
of the pocket-- I get chills

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
every time I think
about it-- and placed me

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
on top of the one spot outside
of the water on the coral reef

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.364 align:middle line:90%
where I could stand.

00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I could look
back in this reef

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and see that the exit was
inches from me all along

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and that this labyrinth was
like a metaphor for my life.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I had been swimming
through this maze,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
following all these
brightly colored fish,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
looking for something
to grab my attention.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was stuck in a
pocket gasping for air.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.074 align:middle line:90%
And that was my life.

00:05:59.074 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yes.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.281 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And suddenly
in that moment

00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
it was like Humpty
Dumpty fell off

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
the wall and the
shell cracked open.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't put
words to it then.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that the me that
swam out of that labyrinth

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
was not the same
guy that swam in.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I could see this
shimmering energy

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:90%
behind everything and everyone.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually
pulled out of society.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I was going to become a monk.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.036 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it was such
an impactful experience?

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:28.967 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So it shook
my entire framework.

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:30.675 align:middle line:84%
And again, I couldn't
put language to it.

00:06:30.675 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot like I
knew intellectually

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:90%
this is what it all meant.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:84%
That old identity had been
ripped from its moorings.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't put it
back together again.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually cloistered
myself in my apartment

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and discovered-- had a
deeper discovery of what

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
was this self that I was
introduced to in that reef?

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, and
also, what was the ego

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that it had such a strong hold
on you to have you really--

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and many, many people, convinced
that the better way is out,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.645 align:middle line:90%
is to end life.

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
well, the ego-- yeah.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.235 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting thing,
because to the ego, what

00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
was interesting over the next
year after that experience,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I experienced tremendous dreams
of death and destruction.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in
retrospect that the ego

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know the difference
between actual death

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and psychological death,
because the ego's just

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:90%
a set of programs.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So to the ego, real change
is equivalent to death.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.919 align:middle line:90%
And that's why it avoids it.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Completely.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It in fact
has an entire mechanism

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.954 align:middle line:84%
that's designed
to prevent change.

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
survival mechanism.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's a
survival, because it's

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
like a virus getting
into the software.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.432 align:middle line:84%
Change is like a
virus to the ego.

00:07:42.432 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a new one.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about that,
why we have such a challenge.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's so
well developed, it

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
will trick us into
thinking we're

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
changing while actually
keeping us the same.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
that experience--

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.665 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty intense.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.968 align:middle line:84%
In that experience,
I could finally

00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
see that this self
that I was trying

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to improve and fix and all
that, that it didn't actually

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:90%
exist except as a concept.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And because when that cracked
open, I saw that the real self,

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
it's already whole.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:90%
It's already complete.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's never been damaged or
diminished by any experience.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It was never
touched or tarnished

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:84%
by all those
experiences, so it didn't

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.665 align:middle line:90%
need to be fixed or healed.

00:08:23.665 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was whole.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.831 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It was already whole.

00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:29.171 align:middle line:84%
And it was already--
like Rumi said,

00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
if you could see
who you really are,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
you would bow before
yourself in worship,

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
because the self I could
feel and I could see

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:84%
was just a masterpiece,
like Michelangelo

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
who would see the angel
already in the block of marble

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and believe that the
divine put it there

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.125 align:middle line:84%
and he would chip away
everything but it.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:48.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aha.

00:08:48.415 --> 00:08:48.915 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:48.915 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
That it would rise
from the marble, yes.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.368 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It would
emerge from the marble

00:08:52.368 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:84%
when he-- as long as
he caught the vision

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and he began to just
remove everything

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't this
completed masterpiece.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.875 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And I
remember in that moment

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I realized that my work
with myself and with others

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:84%
was no longer to try to
fix or change or heal,

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but to get a glimpse of that
masterpiece that's already

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
hidden in that block
of mortal stone

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.839 align:middle line:90%
and help to free that angel.

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what emergence is.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.005 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And that's
what emergence is.

00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not to
fix or chip away.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.679 align:middle line:84%
It's just to bring
what's already there--

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: What's already there.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So no amount
of tragedy or scarring

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
as a child or incidents
could actually

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.132 align:middle line:90%
destroy that part of us.

00:09:32.132 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It doesn't
even touch it.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.174 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Never.

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:34.839 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Never.

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what it
means in the Bible

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:84%
when it says all the years
the locusts have eaten

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:90%
shall be restored unto you.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And behold, I make
all things new.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It's telling you about
a principle, a principle

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that this perfect idea,
this divine pattern

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
of inexhaustible and
unimaginable beauty

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and power and abundance and
genius that is who you really

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
are, that it's
already who you are.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.124 align:middle line:84%
And you can't improve
upon it, either.

00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really
important to know.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.873 align:middle line:84%
That's why I ended up
saying that self-improvement

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:11.494 align:middle line:84%
was an oxymoron, because once
you get who the self is, what

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
the self is, you
can't improve it.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's nothing
to improve upon.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.076 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So then
it just becomes,

00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get in
touch with it and I've

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
got to become in
alignment with it

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:90%
so that it can begin to emerge.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.372 align:middle line:90%
And I use the-- go ahead.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.455 align:middle line:90%
You want to say something.

00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:26.914 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you were
saying-- back to the apartment,

00:10:26.914 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
where you stayed
in the apartment,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:90%
for how long did you stay there?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It was several years.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And I got rid
of TV and news and books

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just went on
this inner journey.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I went out just to like
study with masters and sit,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.486 align:middle line:84%
you know, and be in
meditation environments

00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:43.152 align:middle line:84%
and then come back,
because like I said,

00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I was going to become a monk.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just went on
this inward journey.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, I could see
that the reason why

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I was suffering and
struggling so much

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
is because, again, if you're
coming from the premise

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that you're broken,
that you're inadequate,

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that something's lacking
or missing or wrong, then--

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's completely
a false premise,

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
then everything you
do from that premise

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:84%
is a form of
resistance to what's

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:90%
actually trying to emerge.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And so most of my efforts
to improve my life

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
were the very resistance to the
thing that was there naturally

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
trying to come out,
and that my burning

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
desire for a better
life, that was real.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
From the emergence
model, desire means

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
"of the sire" or
"from the heavens."

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not a sign
of what's outside

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:90%
that you have to go get.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a sign of what's
inside trying to get out.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You're literally
pregnant with it.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.995 align:middle line:90%
And so we feel that desire.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we try to
like go out and make

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
it happen instead of
recognizing it's within us

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.306 align:middle line:84%
and we need to open up
and make it welcome.

00:11:51.306 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when
you make it welcome,

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
just like I use the
example of gaining wealth,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
how do you bring that-- how
does that emergence from within

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.485 align:middle line:84%
have you match the
vibration of wealth?

00:12:04.485 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's all about congruence.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.399 align:middle line:84%
And one analogy I
love is to make this--

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
because you were like saying,
well, it's all within us.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's not like a
bunch of dollar bills

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.891 align:middle line:90%
in us or something.

00:12:16.891 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.456 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Like how do
we make that connection?

00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.316 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And the first
thing is to understand

00:12:22.316 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
that wealth and really
everything that's real

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is invisible and
it's vibrational

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's energetic or spiritual.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And to bring that
home a little bit,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
it's not so woo-woo when
you think about broadcast.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So right now where
we're sitting,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:90%
our favorite music is playing.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Information that would change
our lives is broadcasting.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's broadcasting.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:90%
It's in the field.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But we can't experience
it unless we're

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
tuned in to that station
where it's playing.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's available
to us right now.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It's right now.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It's actually here.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and you
could be depressed.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:90%
You could be whatever.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's information that's
broadcasting-- I'm not even

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.647 align:middle line:84%
talking spiritually, I mean
literally-- in this field

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that if you could tune in to
the station that's playing,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:90%
it would change you instantly.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.751 align:middle line:90%
You'd be inspired.

00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You'd get the information
you need, right?

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You would change.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.148 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So we understand
that as a principle.

00:13:11.148 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:90%
We know radio.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you
tune in to the station

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
where that broadcast
is playing, you

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
didn't make that music happen.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Again, you made it welcome.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't playing
in your future.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't playing
in the distance.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It was actually playing
right where you are.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But you had to
match the frequency.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you find the station
and you tune in to that,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.100 align:middle line:90%
it manifests.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:90%
You have a manifestation.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then
what is resistance?

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
What is it when you
resist something so much

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
or you don't want something
that is attracting to you?

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.161 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, again,
one of the biggest things

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that keeps us stuck and
keeps us in resistance

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
is the belief that something
or someone outside of us

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
has to change in
order for us to be

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
able to be, do, or
have what we want.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.359 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the biggest
misunderstandings.

00:13:57.359 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we believe
that someone or something

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.815 align:middle line:84%
outside of us is our source
of safety, security, supply,

00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
or support, then the universe
is actually set up to betray us.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a principle.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's
set up to fail us.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You believe that?

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: I know it.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.759 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Because
here's the thing--

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and I experienced it too.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is,
it's not outside of you.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think
it's outside of you,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
putting your power--

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
you're projecting your power
onto someone or something.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to
contort and control

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and twist yourself
into a pretzel

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
to get what you think
they have, to not

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
lose what you think
they're going to take.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
trick we get caught up in,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:90%
when all along it's in you.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And the more you're
twisted up, the less you're

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
able to let out what's
in you, the less you're

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:84%
able to be the authentic person
that you really are and bring

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:84%
the gifts and the message
you're here to give,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
because you're now all-- you're
in a whole coping mechanism

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to try to get or get rid of what
you think someone or something

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.867 align:middle line:90%
outside of you has over you.

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: After you
had that experience,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
did you no longer have
the desire to be an actor?

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Or did you change
your line of work?

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.906 align:middle line:90%
Or were you working at the time?

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was-- I stopped
working for a long time.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of living
off of my nest egg.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I guess I was
going to become a monk.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
All I wanted to do
was just connect

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
with this something
that I had experienced,

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
this inner source,
this inner presence.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And I began to read ancient
texts and scriptures

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.025 align:middle line:84%
and the Bibles and the texts
of Buddha and all these things

00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that I'd thrown across
the room literally,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.411 align:middle line:90%
you know, frustrated with.

00:15:35.411 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:90%
These don't mean anything.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's like just a bunch
of just gobbledy-gook and just

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
frustrated.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.899 align:middle line:84%
And now I was reading
them and going, oh, yeah.

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what that means.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.985 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: That's what that is.

00:15:45.985 --> 00:15:46.485 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:46.485 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I had
experienced it directly.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.598 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And I
was like, oh, yeah.

00:15:51.598 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus is saying behold
the kingdom of heaven

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:90%
is at hand now.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But having eyes, you can't
see it and having ears,

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:90%
you can't hear it.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The ego.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.315 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:16:00.315 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, it's
already broadcasting.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It's already here.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
But you're thinking
it's what's appearing.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking it's the dollar
bills or the economy that's

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:90%
your source.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, as Buddha
said, it's within you.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you get in touch
with that thing within you

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and you become
aligned with it, it

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
naturally emerges, not
by struggle and force,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
but by grace.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
particular experience--

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we've
talked about this.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:90%
But it was around money.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was in my apartment.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had been doing all
this deep inner work.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
my bank account,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
my savings account dwindled down
to just pretty much nothing.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the verge
of being evicted.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had bill
collectors knocking

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.154 align:middle line:84%
at my back door, my landlord
knocking at my front door.

00:16:48.154 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting in the middle of
the room in my meditation chair

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:90%
like, ohm, you know.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, you know,
why have you forsaken me?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.203 align:middle line:84%
I was so ticked off at God
or whatever my concept was.

00:16:59.203 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I was like, how
is this possible,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
after all the work I've
done that I'm broke again?

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And I was so mad.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.684 align:middle line:90%
I could say some other words.

00:17:07.684 --> 00:17:08.184 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:08.184 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: And--

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: I won't.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
But I basically, I
put down an ultimatum.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I sat in that chair that
night and I said, OK, God,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
if there even is one, I'm not
getting up from this chair

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:90%
until I know the truth.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:84%
Either this stuff
is real or it's not.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But one way or the other,
I'm finding out tonight.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in that-- it was kind
of like my Gary Sinise moment

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.646 align:middle line:84%
in "Forrest Gump,"
you know, where

00:17:33.646 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
he's like on the top of the
mast and he's like, bring it on.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was very, very adamant.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And I sat in that chair.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And daylight turned to
dusk and the crickets

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
came out for their
nightly chorus.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And like Jacob, I was wrestling
with my angels and demons

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and feeling like I was
getting pinned to the floor.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in
the middle of the night,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
this energy like
opened up in me.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a voice,
but not really a voice.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And it basically said, you made
your savings account your god.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
You made you savings
account your source.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you make anything
outside of you your source,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.014 align:middle line:90%
it will fail you.

00:18:13.014 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: And it was like, poof.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And I got the truth of it.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like thou
shalt have no other gods

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:90%
before me kind of thing.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty intense.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.765 align:middle line:84%
I literally was looking around,
like half-expecting Moses

00:18:24.765 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to be standing there
with a tablet, you know.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.901 align:middle line:84%
And in that same moment, it was
like a pressure valve opened up

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:90%
in me.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And all that stress just
drained out of my body.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.041 align:middle line:90%
And this peace came over me.

00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just get that, I can feel
it again as I talk about it.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was a peace that had
nothing to do with conditions.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
It could be called the peace
that passes understanding.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I rolled into
bed and fell asleep.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And for the next few days, I
was just in this place of peace.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.042 align:middle line:84%
Nothing had changed
in the world.

00:18:55.042 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Bill collectors
were still there.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: They were still there.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
My landlord was
still walking around

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
in her nightgown with
her cigarette with an ash

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:90%
hanging off the end, you know.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This was like a movie.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a bad movie.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.715 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And I'm still
eating my $0.19 boxes

00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:90%
of macaroni and cheese.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.014 align:middle line:90%
And then the phone rings.

00:19:13.014 --> 00:19:14.055 align:middle line:90%
And it's my former agent.

00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:15.744 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, hey, Derek.

00:19:15.744 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I know you don't do commercials
anymore and acting anymore

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:90%
because you're too spiritual.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I was pretty crazy back then.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
He says, but they
just called looking

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
for you out of the blue.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up going on this
audition, booking this thing,

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and for two days' work made more
than I'd ever made in a year.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
But the key was that in
that moment of reconnection

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of the real source of
abundance in my life,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.931 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have outlined
that way of it showing up

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.014 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:44.014 --> 00:19:45.638 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It was
beyond my imagination.

00:19:45.638 --> 00:19:48.077 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you didn't become
the vibrational match for it.

00:19:48.077 --> 00:19:49.785 align:middle line:84%
You didn't intend it
out in the universe.

00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:90%
You didn't have goals and lists.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.692 align:middle line:90%
You just were.

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, I became
the vibrational match.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But it happened as
a moment of grace.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
From that moment of
breakdown, in that moment,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that peace that
came through, that

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
was the match, because
if you imagine,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
if you had all of your needs met
abundantly, how would you feel?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.272 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Complete.

00:20:09.272 --> 00:20:10.063 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Complete.

00:20:10.063 --> 00:20:10.814 align:middle line:90%
You'd be at peace.

00:20:10.814 --> 00:20:12.271 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You would
want for nothing.

00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And that's
how I felt, even

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.421 align:middle line:84%
though the conditions
hadn't changed.

00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.237 align:middle line:84%
Your relationship
to them changed.

00:20:18.237 --> 00:20:20.403 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: My relationship
to the conditions changed.

00:20:20.403 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
As I often say, the real
sign of spiritual growth

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is not so much that the
condition changes yet,

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
but that your response
to it changes.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then the condition
changes as a result of that.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mysteriously,
but not so much.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's not
so mysterious when

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
you understand the principle of
emergence, when you understand

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.929 align:middle line:84%
that, like, when you tune
in to a radio station

00:20:37.929 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you
get the music that's

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:84%
expected from that channel,
you don't got, oh my god.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:90%
You go, of course.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
You'd be really-- that would
be weird if it didn't work.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:84%
How would you-- how do you
live your life like that?

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things happen,
upsetting things.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Things don't go as planned.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:90%
There's accidents.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.609 align:middle line:90%
There's robberies.

00:20:58.609 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Things like that
happen in the world.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: They do.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you change
your relationship with them

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.764 align:middle line:84%
so that the situation then
changes as a result of that?

00:21:06.764 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, there's
two questions in there

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.096 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
really important.

00:21:10.096 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if we can
unpack them both.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:84%
First is, how step by
step do you actually

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.854 align:middle line:90%
practice emergence?

00:21:15.854 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
kind of question.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.228 align:middle line:84%
Like, how do you do this
for real in the world?

00:21:19.228 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the
practical application?

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.484 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And the second
thing is, how do you

00:21:23.484 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
deal with the crises and
the problems and the stuff

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.232 align:middle line:90%
happens kind of thing?

00:21:28.232 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
When that stuff
happens, you've got

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.645 align:middle line:84%
to turn it into fertilizer
to grow more, right?

00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mean, you use it
as fodder to grow more with?

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: When you realize,
because from the emergence

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
model, you begin to
understand in the quantum

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
model of wholeness and
oneness that there really

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
isn't something other
than good going on.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But there can be an
experience less than that,

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
but there's only a
oneness, only a wholeness.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, all the
masters have taught this.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics now
are discovering this.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And so what that means
is that everything,

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
even that-- that
crisis is really

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:90%
an evolutionary catalyst.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a trigger point.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
That problem is actually
an answered prayer.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:84%
You've been praying or
affirming or wanting to grow.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you want to have
more abundance in your life.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.549 align:middle line:84%
And you've been praying,
abundant, abundant, abundant,

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe even activating it.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you are anywhere
holding on to structures

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of belief, concept, or
habit that are not a match,

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:90%
They're going to come up.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to show up as what

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:84%
could be called problems
or crises or breakdowns.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But just like the jack
pine in the forest

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
requires a fire, the forest fire
that rages through and burns

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
away the ground cover,
burns open the canopy,

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
it melts the glue
around the pine cones

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and releases the seeds
for the next level,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
opens up the canopy
so more light gets it.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
That fire is actually
act-- is a condition that's

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.074 align:middle line:84%
necessary for the next
level of evolution.

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you look at
everything that goes wrong

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:90%
in your life as a--

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Absolutely
as a condition.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:90%

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.484 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Everything,

That's a principle.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even things
that go wrong?

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Especially,
because you're

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
like either in a rinse
or a wash cycle, right?

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.584 align:middle line:90%
And so, you know--

00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
profound analogy.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The housewife's analogy
of consciousness.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.947 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: That's right.

00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.465 align:middle line:90%
Are you in the rinse, the wash?

00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:28.756 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's in the wash cycle.

00:23:28.756 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Are you
in the tumble dry?

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.627 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You did
not just say that.

00:23:32.627 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: I said it.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I said it, baby.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Or you've got a little
static cling going on.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We could take the
metaphor too far.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's not.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.264 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: But no, so
you are-- but it's fun.

00:23:41.264 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
This stuff, you know,
it's fun to have levity,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.475 align:middle line:84%
because levity is a
sign of enlightenment.

00:23:45.475 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we cannot take
ourselves too seriously.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.975 align:middle line:84%

nothing serious

00:23:48.975 --> 00:23:50.399 align:middle line:90%
going on in the universe.

00:23:50.399 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, one would think--

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.106 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: There's
nothing serious.

00:23:53.106 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:84%
How could there be anything
serious from the standpoint

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of wholeness and completeness
and eternality and immortality.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But from the relative
level when we've

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:84%
identified with a
condition, an experience--

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like Ebola and those
types of-- those are serious.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.644 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean that
we don't have reverence,

00:24:10.644 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
responsibility,

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that we don't take things--
that we do what we have to do.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I just mean that there's an
underlying reality, a ground

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.920 align:middle line:84%
of being that is joy, that is
peace, that is happiness, that

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
is fulfillment, and it has
nothing to do with conditions.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.584 align:middle line:84%
So you can be even in a
physically bad condition--

00:24:32.584 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was going to
say, what about health?

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: You can be
in a physically bad,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:84%
an emotionally bad
condition-- and I've had this.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I go on
long meditation retreats

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's something physical
that's happening or coming up,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I might be in excruciating pain.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm observing the
excruciating pain.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment, I snap
out of identifying with it.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.062 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize
it's just the pain.

00:24:53.062 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not my pain.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the pain.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:90%
It's an energetic pattern.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able just to relax
and sit back and hold

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that in a larger
place of compassion

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and actually be in a place
of compassion and even joy

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.490 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of what would be
physical or emotional pain.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's the potential.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to recognize
that all the challenges

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
we're facing, there's
an evolutionary trigger

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
or question there that we
start to ask ourselves.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
What is the more
of me that's trying

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:90%
to emerge by means of this?

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
What are the qualities I would
have to embrace or embody

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
or activate in order
to be completely

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:90%
free in the midst of this?

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to ask
those kind of questions,

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:84%
you start to get at
the heart of what

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the real meaning of
that challenge is.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:84%
The meaning of it
is some more of you,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
more love, more compassion,
more joy, more wisdom, more

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
deeper connection with the
source of your real power,

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:90%
More of you is trying to emerge.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's the whole
basis of the law of emergence.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So is there anything that
has come up against the law

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
of emergence for you that
you cannot figure out,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:84%
like someone comes to
you that has cancer

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
or a life-threatening illness,
like the many different types

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
of viruses that are
coming about these days?

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
When you're
questioned about that,

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
how do you explain
those physical realities

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.867 align:middle line:90%
against the law of emergence?

00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, it's important
to understand that there's life

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:90%
and there's life experience.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And life is eternal, immortal,
indestructible, whole,

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:90%
complete, perfect, is love.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:90%
It is joy.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's always and forever.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And it never goes off the air.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It's always broadcasting.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And life experience is
our relative perception

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:90%
of this infinite perfection.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And we can experience as
little or as much of it

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
as we're willing and able to
tap into to become aligned with

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and to see.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're not experiencing
life as it is.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing
life as we are.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.240 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing our concepts
and frameworks of life.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's neither good or bad.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it works.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we call the
world isn't reality.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a collection of
beliefs and agreements.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we call our
own world, same thing.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.696 align:middle line:84%
That's why one person can be
sitting in heaven next to you

00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:15.529 align:middle line:84%
and the other person
can be sitting in hell,

00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're both in
the same condition.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So I would start there,
to understand that.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing is to know

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that no appearance ultimately
has any power or authority

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:84%
over you, because all power,
all substance, all law

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:90%
is in consciousness.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of
what you're facing,

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:84%
if you get in touch with
that truth of your being,

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.702 align:middle line:84%
that vision that's
trying to emerge,

00:27:37.702 --> 00:27:39.410 align:middle line:84%
you can activate it
and begin to bring it

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.679 align:middle line:90%
forth regardless of condition.

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wonder if this could
also have to do with thoughts.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.545 align:middle line:84%
So you know, our
thoughts sometimes,

00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:46.961 align:middle line:84%
you know, they
create our reality,

00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and we could think ourselves
into, as you did, destruction.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Can you take those
thoughts and the ones that

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
are self-defeating
thoughts and really

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
push them out with
the law of emergence?

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Can you take the I'm
tired, I'm exhausted

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and regain energy from
something like that?

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.315 align:middle line:84%
Can you use it to
physically manifest?

00:28:08.315 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Absolutely.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And though the slight
difference with emergence

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
is that you understand, again,
there's nothing to get rid of.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So even the I'm tired
thought, even the-- it's

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.164 align:middle line:84%
like again to go
back to the natural--

00:28:21.164 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
because we all
have a lot of stuff

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
trying to get rid of.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
This part of me that feels
angry, that feels sad,

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that feels ugly,
that feels sick,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.014 align:middle line:84%
that feels greedy
and selfish or god

00:28:33.014 --> 00:28:35.430 align:middle line:84%
forbid you're a heart-centered,
spiritually-minded people,

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and you're selfish.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the biggest
shadows for a lot

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of heart-centered
people and it's

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:90%
what they most need to embrace.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.825 align:middle line:84%
But when you
understand that just

00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:90%
in-- what is the soil made of?

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It's made of everything that
has died and decayed before.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It's all that has rotted
and decayed and it's dark.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.295 align:middle line:84%
And the darker and the
smellier, the better.

00:28:56.295 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's also got
nutrients and minerals.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.424 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, it's pure
nutrients and minerals.

00:29:00.424 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
What those are nutrients
and minerals made of?

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everything else.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Everything that has
died and rotted and decayed

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And if a seed tried
to grow the way

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:84%
we do in our personal
development and all

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that, it would get rid
of all the dirt, right?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.308 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Because that's
all smelly and gross and bad

00:29:16.308 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:90%
and dark and scary and dank.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And if it succeeded, it would
be finally on top of a rock.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And it would raise its little
seedling hands triumphant,

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:90%
you know, I'm successful.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.142 align:middle line:90%
Victory at last.

00:29:28.142 --> 00:29:28.920 align:middle line:90%
No more dirt.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the sun would come out
and shine its glorious rays

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
upon the seed and
burn it to a crisp.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the seed buries
itself in the dirt.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And when the sun comes
out now, the light

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
activates what's in the
darkness, what's in the dirt.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we embrace
those parts of us,

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
like the tired self--
if you find you're tired

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to
let yourself be tired,

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.195 align:middle line:84%
you probably have a
shadow around being lazy,

00:29:53.195 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:90%
around being a failure.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you check
early on, you got

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.527 align:middle line:84%
a message early on
that said come on, now.

00:29:59.527 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
just laying around?

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.568 align:middle line:84%
Or what are you
doing just playing?

00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And you got a message
that it was bad.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And so you began to create
a mask, a persona of being

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the good boy and good girl,
hard worker, never get tired,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:84%
never get sick, and maybe
a caretaker and a do-gooder

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and overachiever.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And all that's the
gift of the shadow,

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
because that was
activated as a reaction

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
to the thing you didn't
want to be, right?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain point,
it doesn't work anymore.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And it creates burnout.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And it creates other
kinds of backlash.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have to actually
embrace the very thing

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:90%
you've been running from.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
a whole nother level

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
of what you want in your
life starts to emerge,

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.209 align:middle line:84%
because it was just more
of the potential that

00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:84%
needed to be cultivated
in that soil.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.583 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Going back to the harvest.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So are there specific stages
of the law of emergence

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that people could-- that
they go through or could

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
try to go through to reach
what you had in terms

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of that awakening without
going through that specific

00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
whole point, hopefully,

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is that they can
practice now consciously.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're going to
evolve one way or the other.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It's are you going to
do it consciously or get

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:90%
dragged kicking and screaming?

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was being dragged
kicking and screaming.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your
goal now is to get

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.025 align:middle line:84%
people to go through
this consciously

00:31:19.025 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to
go through what you did.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's not to say that--

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They won't.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: --we can avoid--
you know the old adage,

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
pain is unavoidable
but suffering

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:90%
is, suffering's a choice.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: So you know--

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or no pain, no gain.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.925 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:31:32.925 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pain is a part
of life experience.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.314 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
to be suffering.

00:31:37.314 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Pain only becomes
suffering when there's

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:84%
resistance, when
there's judgment.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you apply your
relationship to it, yes.

00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So I can't say this is
going to end the challenges.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to allow us
to embrace our challenges

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and get the most out of them.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So the seven basic stages
are-- the first stage

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:90%
is see the completed vision.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
the process of beginning

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to identify what is the
vision for your life?

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.301 align:middle line:90%
What is trying to emerge?

00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your whole life?

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Well,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to
be your whole life.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:90%
It can be your whole life.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It can be one area of your
life, because any true framework

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.789 align:middle line:84%
of principle can be applied
in the macro and the micro.

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can just focus on a
relationship with emergence.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:90%
You can just focus on a project.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it work tremendously
successful in all the--

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.850 align:middle line:84%
just when we wanted to get
our house, our first home,

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:90%
we did that work.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And where we went from not
being able to afford it, no way,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.450 align:middle line:84%
no how, and in a couple months
moving into our dream house.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.277 align:middle line:84%
So it can be
focused in any area,

00:32:34.277 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's a framework
that you can apply.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing is, you
must know where you're going.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:84%
That's another way to put it
because if you don't know where

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.819 align:middle line:84%
you're going, every
road takes you there.

00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:90%
You get diffused.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Right?

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And as it says in Proverbs,
where there is no vision,

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:90%
the people perish.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say they
have a bad day.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.185 align:middle line:90%
It says they perish.

00:32:54.185 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:84%
If they don't
literally die, they

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:90%
become like the walking dead.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not standing up,
if you're not living your own

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.331 align:middle line:84%
life, you're living
someone else's.

00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.100 align:middle line:90%
What they wanted for you.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Your peer
pressure, parental fantasy,

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.092 align:middle line:84%
societal conditioning, just
the thought viruses in the air.

00:33:10.092 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dangerous, yes.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:11.675 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:33:11.675 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So you need to become anchored
in your values, in your vision.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the clues to
that is your deepest desire,

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about earlier,
what you really, really,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
really want, not just the big
screen TV and the new car,

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:90%
though that might be a clue.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:90%
But what do you really want?

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Who do you really want to be?

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.500 align:middle line:84%
What do you really want to
have and do and contribute?

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So you get in touch
with a vision.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And again--

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
yours, by the way?

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, my
core vision and mission

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is to awaken people to
their true identity,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.279 align:middle line:84%
inspire them to
fulfill their destiny,

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
so that together we
can create a world that

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.570 align:middle line:84%
works for the
highest good of all.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Big picture vision.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Big picture vision.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And I would say in the
smaller it's just awaking.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, in every
moment, in every project,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
in every conversation,
it's about somehow,

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.361 align:middle line:90%
some way awakening more.

00:33:57.361 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the first
step would be--

00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: More awareness,
to put it into your term.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.755 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is to
be-- to get your vision.

00:34:03.755 --> 00:34:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: To have a vision.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The long term.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And it
doesn't even have

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.686 align:middle line:84%
to be-- because that
scares some people.

00:34:08.686 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't know.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.525 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:10.525 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.199 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, what is
your burning desire?

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you can look out
at the world and see

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:84%
who really pulls you
and attracts you.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.949 align:middle line:84%
And identify what
is it about them,

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
their qualities,
their attributes,

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and write that
down, because that's

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:84%
a snapshot of what I
call a soul profile.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a projection of
what's in you trying to emerge.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:90%
That's why it pulls you.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So get in touch with
a vision, something.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, if it's just
that I want to have

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:84%
more money,
financial security, I

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:43.533 align:middle line:84%
want to just know that my
kids are going to be OK.

00:34:43.533 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:90%
It can be small.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.765 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
small, by the way.

00:34:45.765 --> 00:34:46.306 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:34:46.306 --> 00:34:46.739 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And then the next step.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And the next
step is now you take that

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:84%
and you identify what are
the qualities of that vision?

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:84%
If you were living
that vision-- this

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:84%
is where visualization
is a good tool,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:84%
because you use visualization
not to make it happen

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.410 align:middle line:84%
but to get in touch
with what it feels like.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like the emotions of it?

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: The vibrations,
the emotional frequency,

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.440 align:middle line:90%
the vibrational tone.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.685 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:06.685 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's what I
call the LIFT practice,

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Living In the Feeling Tone.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:90%
So you get in touch with that.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling tone
of joy-- like right now

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:84%
if you stop to kind of
imagine the money coming in,

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.000 align:middle line:84%
all is well, you'll
start to feel

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of peace,
little bit of joy.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.409 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

00:35:24.409 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And you notice it has nothing
to do with the condition,

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:84%
because the condition
hasn't changed.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the feeling.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It's the feeling.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.854 align:middle line:90%
And it's a vibration.

00:35:30.854 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It's you tuning the dial
of your consciousness

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to the station where
your music is playing,

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:90%
tuning from KLACK to KRICH.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And so it's right there.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you use
that, you identify

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.970 align:middle line:84%
some of the qualities of
feeling and also identify

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:90%
some of the qualities of being.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling are like
feeling joyful, maybe

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.749 align:middle line:90%
abundant, peaceful, expanded.

00:35:55.749 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then you need actions
that are associated with those?

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Well, no.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.298 align:middle line:84%
Then you identify the
qualities of being,

00:36:00.298 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:84%
so that's like-- a being is a
more active quality, like being

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.327 align:middle line:84%
loving, being spontaneous,
being playful, being generous.

00:36:07.327 --> 00:36:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: So if you were--

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:09.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Being forgiving.

00:36:09.925 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Being forgiving.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you had this
thing, notice who

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:90%
you're being in that vision.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
You start to notice
I'm more playful.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.781 align:middle line:90%
I'm more outgoing.

00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Write that down.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So now you're starting to get
an energetic map of what's

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.880 align:middle line:90%
actually trying to emerge.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's step two is cultivate
the congruent conditions.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.387 align:middle line:84%
So now you kind of
know what the seed

00:36:30.387 --> 00:36:32.500 align:middle line:90%
is, or least your best guess.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the vision.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the seed.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: You're
now planting it.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're beginning to
cultivate the soil of your soul

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:84%
so that it's matching
the seed pattern.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, you're not trying
to attract anything.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.501 align:middle line:84%
That's an important
contextual shift.

00:36:44.501 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
visualizing creating it.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: To feel it.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you're
intensifying the emotions

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:48.695 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly.

00:36:48.695 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:90%
You're cultivating it.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
you're becoming it.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.424 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And then
the step three

00:36:51.424 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:90%
is create the quantum plan.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And we won't go into
all the details,

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:84%
but you basically are taking
these qualities-- so let's just

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.390 align:middle line:84%
say for example one of the
feeling qualities is joy.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And you ask a few questions.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You look at people, places,
activities, and objects

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that have either activated
that in the past,

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.960 align:middle line:84%
are presently doing it but
you don't spend a lot of time

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.430 align:middle line:84%
with it, or you feel
would and you just

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
aren't finding time to do it.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you notice when
you sing you feel joy,

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.160 align:middle line:90%
but you don't do it very often.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Or when you do yoga you feel
peace, but you never have time.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Or when you're hanging
out with so-and-so

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:84%
or listening to their thing
or watching their TV thing,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.690 align:middle line:84%
you feel that, but you
can't make the time.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Now you notice that's
something you can consciously

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.590 align:middle line:90%
engineer into your daily plan.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
emergineering, engineering

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.260 align:middle line:90%
the emergence.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's something
that's outside of you,

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:90%
but it's chosen.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But you're using it not
to go out and get it,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:84%
but you're using it to
cultivate the conditions,

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to create an environment
that's like putting food

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:90%
into the soil.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It's feeding you.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.139 align:middle line:90%
It's activating you.

00:37:58.139 --> 00:37:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And because we've
already done this--

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.230 align:middle line:84%
we've already
engineered our lives.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But we've engineered
them as a reaction,

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.447 align:middle line:84%
as a reaction often from safety
and protection and coping.

00:38:07.447 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:90%
But we've already done it.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.863 align:middle line:84%
We're already spending the
time with the people, places,

00:38:10.863 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:84%
things, and activities
that match the vision

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are
fundamentally holding.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So now we're consciously
co-creating a new environment

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
so that it's a match
for the life-- you want

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to begin to surround yourself
with the people, places, things

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that represent your
future, not your past.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if some of those
people, places, and things

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:84%
are not ones that
you want around you.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So say a brother who has a
scarcity complex or anger

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.950 align:middle line:84%
issues or something like
that, but they're related to.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.442 align:middle line:90%
How do you change that?

00:38:43.442 --> 00:38:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't be
in resistance to it,

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:90%
as you're saying, right?

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Right.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so--

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well, it's the
good news and the bad news.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of it
is-- the first thing is

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever you enter
a room or a relationship,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
whatever you meet
is what you bring.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:01.042 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:39:01.042 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever is missing
is what you're not giving.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Whatever's missing
is what you're not giving?

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.405 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:39:05.405 --> 00:39:06.954 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can show
up in your life--

00:39:06.954 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
if you want more to
come into your life,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to have more
life come out of you.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:90%
That's emergence.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.019 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So if I come into a room
where someone's angry,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not giving-- explain.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: If it pushes
your buttons in any way,

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.130 align:middle line:84%
if your response to it is
anything less than love

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:25.012 align:middle line:84%
and compassion, then it's a
reflection of something in you.

00:39:25.012 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Activating something.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.011 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's activating
something in you.

00:39:28.011 --> 00:39:30.624 align:middle line:84%
And you are already a
vibrational match for that,

00:39:30.624 --> 00:39:32.790 align:middle line:84%
just like if you're tuned
in to a particular station

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.250 align:middle line:84%
on a radio, all the people
that like that kind of music

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:84%
are also tuned
into that station.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I'm
bringing in an energy

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.512 align:middle line:84%
where I might not be
expressing my anger?

00:39:40.512 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Where you might
not be expressing it.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.178 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's touching,
it's because there's

00:39:44.178 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:90%
anger in you that's unexpressed.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And when you deal
with that, one of two things

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:90%
will happen.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:84%
As you take 100% responsibility
for your experience,

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
knowing that whatever
pushes or pulls

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you is a projection of
your unintegrated potential

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.577 align:middle line:84%
of emergence, then
one of two things

00:40:00.577 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:90%
will happen in your environment.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.040 align:middle line:90%
That environment will change.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Or you will
be moved out of it.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.921 align:middle line:90%
It'll naturally happen.

00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And I use the example
when I was a waiter.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: I was a
waiter at a job.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I was an up and coming
actor, lost everything

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:84%
after the opening
that I had, ended up

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.079 align:middle line:84%
becoming a waiter,
had to wait on people

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.370 align:middle line:90%
that I had been in movies with.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And I began to practice
this and show up

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.202 align:middle line:84%
as the person I
would be if I was

00:40:25.202 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:90%
living the life of my dreams.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I brought the
excellence and the joy

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and the compassion
and the service.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And I got fired.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized I
hadn't done anything wrong.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:90%
They hired me back.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So I kept digging
deeper, doing the work.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was just-- I was
giving five-star service

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.119 align:middle line:90%
in a three-star restaurant.

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:42.660 align:middle line:84%
It was pissing off
the other waiters.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.576 align:middle line:90%
And it was, you know--

00:40:43.576 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And eventually some
of them came around.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I got fired again.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, huh.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they were like, oh,
we realize it was mistake.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.605 align:middle line:90%
They hired me back.

00:40:55.605 --> 00:40:57.855 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm doing it, doing
the work, doing the work.

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You went back?

00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:59.534 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:40:59.534 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:90%
I needed the job.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: I think it was my
wife that said, get a job.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.820 align:middle line:90%
But no, it was very important.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was
doing important work.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was
cultivating something

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:84%
in that gymnasium of my
soul called this job.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it was
just a working ground.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It was.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was just a school.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.416 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And people started--
I mean, I got amazing tips.

00:41:22.416 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They wrote to corporate
about my waiting.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
fired a third time.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And so I stay fired that time.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And I knew my work was done.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And within about a few weeks
I got hired doing the work I

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.110 align:middle line:84%
really wanted to do
almost on accident,

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
making 20 times more and being
wined and dined in five-star

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
restaurants and being able to
be of service, be excellent,

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.340 align:middle line:90%
do all the things--

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So that didn't
happen in my future.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I was developing the conditions
to match that seed right there

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:54.330 align:middle line:90%
on the job.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:55.599 align:middle line:90%
So I'm saying that to say--

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good point.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Whatever
relationship you're in,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.370 align:middle line:84%
whatever job you're in,
whatever situation that's bad,

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.470 align:middle line:90%
that's your gym.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only caveat is if it's
literally violent or abusive,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:84%
get out and work on
yourself in a safe distance.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So we got through three
of the steps of emergence.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:14.820 align:middle line:90%
I think it might have--

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So create the quantum
plan was the one we were on.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And you want to design
your life based on those.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can just start
with one quality at a time.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And then with the
being quality, it's

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:90%
a slightly different question.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You just ask what would it--
let's say the being is playful,

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.310 align:middle line:90%
be more playful.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:84%
What would it look
like to be more--

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.110 align:middle line:84%
to step into being
more playful now?

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Because again, we're putting a
lot of these qualities on hold,

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.210 align:middle line:90%
on the layaway plan.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll be more playful when?

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.147 align:middle line:84%
I'll be more generous
when I have more money.

00:42:41.147 --> 00:42:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is it
doesn't work that way.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.129 align:middle line:90%
That's backwards.

00:42:44.129 --> 00:42:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.584 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: You have
to activate it first.

00:42:46.584 --> 00:42:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you ask, what
would it look like?

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you're willing,
you'll begin to get guidance.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find ways
to step into being.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So as you're now feeling
and you're being,

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.680 align:middle line:84%
you've designed a way of
life that's congruent.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:90%
That becomes part of your plan.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the quantum plan.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about when things
don't go your way, when--

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yes.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You love that?

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.000 align:middle line:90%
This morning--

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: I love being contrary.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:11.515 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:43:11.515 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, help me on this one.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So this morning
my daughter didn't

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.380 align:middle line:84%
get her homework
done for school.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't
necessarily her thing.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The days prior I had
a bunch of events

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that I brought her to
with me because I wanted

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.970 align:middle line:84%
her participation in the events
and I wanted her to be with me.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:90%
We had a blast.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.700 align:middle line:84%
We had a great time,
lots of great connection.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And then she forgot an
assignment the night before.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And everything blew
up in the morning.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel very guilty about
that, because it took away

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.580 align:middle line:90%
all the fun that we had.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to--
and I didn't want

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to make her feel bad for
the fun that I was tired,

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.370 align:middle line:84%
exhausted, stressed, and I
had deadlines I missed also.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So I feel guilty
about this morning.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:06.492 align:middle line:84%
So how did I bring something
to that party that I'm missing?

00:44:06.492 --> 00:44:07.200 align:middle line:90%
What did you say?

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.617 align:middle line:90%
You--

00:44:08.617 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: That when you
walk into a room, whatever

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is missing is what
you're not bringing.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.706 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Correct.

00:44:12.706 --> 00:44:15.481 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Or whatever you
meet is what you brought.

00:44:15.481 --> 00:44:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm still working on this one.

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:17.669 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:17.669 --> 00:44:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't bring compassion.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't bring forgiveness.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I brought a tired
mother to the scene.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And even
more important, I

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.260 align:middle line:84%
think, because that's
one way to look at it,

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.644 align:middle line:84%
which is a little bit kind
of beating yourself up.

00:44:32.644 --> 00:44:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So there's
a pattern of-- we

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.940 align:middle line:84%
won't go into a
coaching session.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.106 align:middle line:90%
But there's a pattern there.

00:44:37.106 --> 00:44:38.679 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- so the
real gift here--

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why not go into
a coaching session?

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.240 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the
way I was raised.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Beating myself up.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It's there.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.315 align:middle line:84%
It's also connected to the stuff
we were talking about earlier.

00:44:46.315 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, don't
get me started,

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.498 align:middle line:84%
because I'll just
go right into it.

00:44:49.498 --> 00:44:51.087 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Go.

00:44:51.087 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Because I can
start to see the patterns.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can see.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.630 align:middle line:90%
I can see the childhood.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.713 align:middle line:84%
I can see it all going do,
do, do, do, do, do, do.

00:44:56.713 --> 00:44:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yup.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: But one of the gifts
here is how it made you feel,

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:06.172 align:middle line:84%
like a bad parent or
like controlling or--

00:45:06.172 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All that stuff
from my childhood,

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:84%
like how I was yelled at
totally came out of my mouth.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:11.535 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: How you
experienced your mom.

00:45:11.535 --> 00:45:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I couldn't
believe I did that.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.225 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:45:14.225 --> 00:45:16.016 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I was
conscious in the process,

00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:17.236 align:middle line:90%
going don't let it come up.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it come up.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:19.100 align:middle line:90%
But it was surfacing.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.725 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Now, that's
really important.

00:45:20.725 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:90%
I know that very well.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting chills again.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Very tough
position to be in.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's really
important, because that's a key.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.714 align:middle line:84%
As transformation
happens, you'll

00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:29.030 align:middle line:90%
even notice you have awareness.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.307 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, no,
don't take the bait.

00:45:31.307 --> 00:45:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Don't take the bait.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Don't take the bait.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.327 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't do it.

00:45:33.327 --> 00:45:33.734 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:45:33.734 --> 00:45:34.234 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:45:34.234 --> 00:45:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:35.535 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Oh.

00:45:35.535 --> 00:45:36.034 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:36.034 --> 00:45:36.958 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.137 align:middle line:84%
It's that consciousness
caving in.

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Just like,
shoosh, grabs the bait.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:42.530 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It's a muscle.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's just it hasn't been--

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's exercising.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: The awareness muscle
under that heat of that pattern

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:90%
hasn't gotten strong enough yet.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.232 align:middle line:90%
That's one reason.

00:45:52.232 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason
is the pattern

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.930 align:middle line:84%
itself hasn't been
embraced enough yet.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.945 align:middle line:90%
There's still a fight with it.

00:45:58.945 --> 00:45:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:03.138 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And so the irony
is that the part of us that's

00:46:03.138 --> 00:46:04.637 align:middle line:84%
like don't do it,
don't do it, don't

00:46:04.637 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:84%
do it is actually giving
the pattern more energy.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So it's like
if you push on my hand

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.532 align:middle line:84%
and I push back,
the more I push,

00:46:12.532 --> 00:46:13.990 align:middle line:84%
the more you're
going to push back.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural tendency.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin
to look at, well,

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:20.710 align:middle line:84%
what is the thing
I don't want to be?

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
this controlling

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.220 align:middle line:90%
you know what that my mom was.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:26.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the shadow.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:28.054 align:middle line:90%
None of us do.

00:46:28.054 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Right.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's a shadow.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And here's the great news.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: The great news is
that part of you is beautiful.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The controlling,
crazy, aggressive,

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:46.940 align:middle line:84%
angry you know what is a
gorgeous, beautiful, rich part

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.550 align:middle line:90%
of you, like the soil.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's got a charge
on it right now.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's misunderstood.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a misunderstood
part of you.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:47:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And she's crying out to be seen,
to be understood, to be held,

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:07.010 align:middle line:84%
to be loved, and to finally
be accepted back to the table.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And what she has to bring you
is a level of power and strength

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and clarity and
control in a bigger

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.420 align:middle line:84%
sense of the word that
you haven't yet to touch

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.180 align:middle line:84%
but that your soul
is aching to have,

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that will create a structure
for an even bigger life,

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:90%
an even deeper and richer life.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So she's got all
these gifts for you.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.580 align:middle line:90%
But she got--

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Checked.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:35.235 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: When you were younger,
it was a coping mechanism.

00:47:35.235 --> 00:47:35.776 align:middle line:90%
You saw that.

00:47:35.776 --> 00:47:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no way
will I ever be that.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you began to become
the opposite, sweet and nice--

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.535 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Too docile.

00:47:43.535 --> 00:47:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.409 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not saying my opinion.

00:47:45.409 --> 00:47:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: The good
girl, all of that stuff.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And again, that's the gift.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:84%
The gift is you are a very
sweet, very heart-centered,

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.230 align:middle line:84%
very kind, very
conscious person.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that core wound
was a core initiation.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That was actually
initiating you on your path,

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
because it caused you,
through that pain when

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.110 align:middle line:84%
you felt controlled and
repressed and out of control,

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:84%
it caused you to have
to find deeper places,

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.685 align:middle line:84%
to find your own
connection and peace.

00:48:12.685 --> 00:48:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My daughter said
something really important

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to me in the car on
the way to school

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.830 align:middle line:84%
as I realized the
pattern was happening

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm like, we're
10 minutes in school.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Calm down.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me
something so beautiful.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.640 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Mom, you're
making me feel stupid."

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:90%
It was golden.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.140 align:middle line:90%
That moment was so beautiful.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly how you felt.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And she checked me.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And I went doot, doot, doot.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's the way
my mom made me feel.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And then I failed math.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed to
prove all that to her.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.110 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is
anything but stupid.

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.520 align:middle line:90%
She is brilliant.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:90%
She is beautiful.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:90%
She is whole.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And she checked her mom.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yes.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In that moment--

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And a

00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.490 align:middle line:90%
And she's 11.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was able
to do that to me.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So I get now the opportunity
to apologize tonight.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.350 align:middle line:90%
And you also--

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To learn.

opportunity to think of her

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.570 align:middle line:84%

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:15.589 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:16.380 align:middle line:90%
To heal that wound.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.671 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Because the part
that really needs to be held

00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and hugged and loved is her.

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: I mean that's the

00:49:23.766 --> 00:49:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Is the little you.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

And also, fall in love.

00:49:29.451 --> 00:49:31.950 align:middle line:84%
When you understand it's the
shadow work, part of the shadow

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.892 align:middle line:84%
work which is part
of stage six, we

00:49:33.892 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:84%
could have skipped
a couple stages.

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But stage six of emergence is
embrace what appears broken.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when you embrace
like the stupid self.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.500 align:middle line:84%
The stupid self, I
love my stupid self.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.805 align:middle line:90%
I'm so stupid.

00:49:47.805 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.329 align:middle line:84%
But when you love
the stupid self, then

00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:55.370 align:middle line:84%
what happens when you
don't love the stupid self,

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:56.340 align:middle line:90%
you do a couple things.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.940 align:middle line:84%
You strive really
hard to be smart.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: And that's a gift.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.890 align:middle line:84%

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:08.316 align:middle line:84%
You kind of really monitor
what you say and kind of

00:50:08.316 --> 00:50:09.898 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of control
around it so you

00:50:09.898 --> 00:50:12.116 align:middle line:84%
don't say something stupid
or do something stupid.

00:50:12.116 --> 00:50:13.865 align:middle line:84%
When you fall in love
with the stupid self

00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and integrate him or
her back into you,

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.535 align:middle line:84%
it frees you up and allows
you to be a student,

00:50:19.535 --> 00:50:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to be a learner, to ask
all the questions you need.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.760 align:middle line:90%

>>RYDALL: And also, it makes
you a channel now of wisdom

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and transcendent wisdom
beyond your human mind

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.650 align:middle line:90%
and your history.

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
When I'm speaking or
teaching or coaching,

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.520 align:middle line:84%
stuff comes through
me, and I'm just like,

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.630 align:middle line:90%
whoa, that's pretty cool.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm learning and watching
as it's coming through,

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.270 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
judging or monitoring.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say some
things sometimes

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.830 align:middle line:90%
that are like really intense.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Like somebody will be
all sad and all kind of--

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and I won't be sympathetic.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll just be like, shh, you
need to-- And it's like crack.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And they start crying
and then laughing.

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And in minutes, not months,
they're having a healing.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But if I was afraid of being
stupid or for me being a bad

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:08.060 align:middle line:84%
guy, being a jerk-- which
are part of my shadows--

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.065 align:middle line:84%
before I embraced those
things, I was a very nice coach

00:51:11.065 --> 00:51:12.720 align:middle line:90%

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.276 align:middle line:84%
sometimes my work is to
comfort the afflicted.

00:51:20.276 --> 00:51:22.400 align:middle line:84%

I've come with a sword
to separate mother

father from son.

00:51:32.755 --> 00:51:36.170 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
truth cuts sometimes.

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:38.870 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, so when you
embrace those parts of you,

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:44.230 align:middle line:84%
a whole new world of gifts
and energy gets freed up.

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And all the struggle, the
war-- because the only conflict

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:49.412 align:middle line:90%
going on is the one in us.

00:51:49.412 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And this has nothing
to do with her.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.360 align:middle line:84%
She simply-- she
underestimated the assignment.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.125 align:middle line:84%
And it had nothing
to do with her.

00:51:56.125 --> 00:51:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Right

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nothing to do with her.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It had everything to do
with the perfection pictures

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that I was raised
with and not being

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.739 align:middle line:84%
able to speak up and all
of that fabulous stuff.

00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:07.364 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:52:07.364 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And you now being
able to-- as you

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:84%
fall in love with your stupid,
lazy, inadequate self and just

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.359 align:middle line:84%
love her up and just
realize she's so cool

00:52:16.359 --> 00:52:17.775 align:middle line:84%
and she just frees
you up so much,

00:52:17.775 --> 00:52:19.475 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to model
that for your daughter.

00:52:19.475 --> 00:52:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.462 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And be like, let's
just be totally stupid and just

00:52:22.462 --> 00:52:23.796 align:middle line:90%
lazy and just--

00:52:23.796 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good idea.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And she'll
get the model now

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.150 align:middle line:90%
that it's totally cool.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:31.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no threat there.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:31.596 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's OK.

00:52:31.596 --> 00:52:32.096 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And the
fears that we suddenly

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:36.540 align:middle line:84%
won't be disciplined
and focused.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.120 align:middle line:90%
You'll be more so.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when you have the other
shadow and you aren't embracing

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.480 align:middle line:84%
it, a lot of times like
a kid that's acting out,

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that part of you will sabotage
your success and the things

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:84%
you're-- it'll say, you
think you have a plan?

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Watch me totally wreck it.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So it'll sabotage those
things to get your attention

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.040 align:middle line:90%
so that you'll feel stupid.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.520 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel like a failure.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.959 align:middle line:90%
But that's the opening.

00:53:01.959 --> 00:53:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So nothing that
you're talking about here

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.700 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do with
manifestation or goal-setting

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.950 align:middle line:90%
or anything outside.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all like what
you just gave,

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:16.150 align:middle line:84%
my example, that emergence
within me of that self that

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:21.690 align:middle line:84%
needs healing that-- in order
to be more fun and more playful

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.730 align:middle line:84%
will create whatever
goal it is that I want.

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Exactly.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.682 align:middle line:84%
As you embrace-- I
mean, it's a process.

00:53:27.682 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a great example.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: But as you
embrace those parts of you,

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.710 align:middle line:84%
qualities are going
to be activated

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in you that are not right now,
frequencies that are not right

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:37.170 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And as those frequencies
come together,

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that's a match to a
larger version of you

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:44.790 align:middle line:90%
that's already here.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:47.090 align:middle line:84%
That pattern, that's
a match for that.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And then how
this life experience works

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is when you tune
in to the station

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and your station matches the
frequency of the station,

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.200 align:middle line:84%
what's broadcasting in the
invisible becomes manifest.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.615 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call it
your manifest-station.

00:54:01.615 --> 00:54:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So it does
become manifest.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very real and
very practical.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.515 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
this is-- we'll

00:54:07.515 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:84%
jump to stage four real
quick, because I want

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to say this is not
about not taking action.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Once you know what your
vision is, what you want--

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, let's
say you wanted--

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.680 align:middle line:84%
part of that bigger
vision was more playful,

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.846 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing this
great work and visualizing

00:54:22.846 --> 00:54:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden this
whole thing blows up

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.350 align:middle line:90%
with your daughter.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:25.990 align:middle line:90%
You're like, oh my god.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.850 align:middle line:84%
This isn't working,
what Derek told me.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It's working perfectly.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfectly.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It's giving
you the condition

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.710 align:middle line:84%
to see where you're actually not
letting more of that come out.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
make that example,

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.296 align:middle line:84%
because you asked earlier why
are these problems and crises,

00:54:39.296 --> 00:54:41.170 align:middle line:84%
how is that all part of
the bigger unfolding?

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So stuff
still happens with you

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.509 align:middle line:84%
and systems still break down
and things still go wrong.

00:54:46.509 --> 00:54:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Oh, yeah.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.922 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you do what?

00:54:48.922 --> 00:54:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: And I drink a little.

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:51.850 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:54.830 align:middle line:90%


00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:55.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Water.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.419 align:middle line:84%
You know, some highly
oxygenated alkaline water.

00:54:59.419 --> 00:54:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So well,
you know, it's funny.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Jesus didn't turn
the wine into water.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.180 align:middle line:90%
He turned the water into wine.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:09.969 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:55:09.969 --> 00:55:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: He was at
a lot of parties.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.306 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was a
constant party back then.

00:55:15.306 --> 00:55:15.742 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Constant.

00:55:15.742 --> 00:55:16.242 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:16.242 --> 00:55:17.072 align:middle line:90%
So I do the work.

00:55:17.072 --> 00:55:19.072 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you for
being playful, by the way.

00:55:19.072 --> 00:55:19.697 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:55:19.697 --> 00:55:20.547 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:20.547 --> 00:55:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Things break down.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.950 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Things break down.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:84%
My wife went through cancer,
through breast cancer.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: My son got kicked
out of school for drugs.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: You know, he
came out as being gay.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:90%
He crashed his first two cars.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:39.420 align:middle line:84%
My first two teams at
my company fell apart.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.500 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of
wonderful challenges.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.042 align:middle line:84%
But what every single one
gives me the opportunity

00:55:45.042 --> 00:55:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to do is, first of
all, it's always

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.470 align:middle line:84%
a check to see where
am I really living?

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:84%
All these great teachings
and ideas, blah, blah, blah.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Where am I really?

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Where am I really anchored?

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Do I really have
love and real peace?

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.831 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's really
lighting me up?

00:55:58.831 --> 00:56:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: What do I really
own in my consciousness?

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So I get to experience
that, right?

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's a really cool thing.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
is, this comes up.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ooh.

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Now more of me is going to get
to be activated, more of me

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.150 align:middle line:90%
is going to be revealed.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And so I do the work.

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:19.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I don't
judge by appearances.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to be a
problem-solver, because as long

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.130 align:middle line:84%
as you're trying
to solve a problem,

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:84%
you're stuck at the
frequency of the problem.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why Einstein
said you can't

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:29.970 align:middle line:84%
solve a problem at the level
of thinking that created it,

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.445 align:middle line:84%
or why race car drivers learn
that if you're speeding out

00:56:32.445 --> 00:56:34.525 align:middle line:84%
of control to a wall,
don't focus on the wall.

00:56:34.525 --> 00:56:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let go, yeah.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: If you focus
on the wall, the problem,

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.818 align:middle line:90%
you're going to hit it.

00:56:37.818 --> 00:56:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you focus on
where you want to go--

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.371 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You turn in to--

00:56:41.371 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: The hands
follow the eyes.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:43.411 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:56:43.411 --> 00:56:45.652 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And the energy
follows your attention.

00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So you want to move from
being a problem-solver

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to a vision-holder.

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.360 align:middle line:90%
That's why we start with vision.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So you always go
back to the vision.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.700 align:middle line:90%
What's the vision?

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.699 align:middle line:90%
What's trying to emerge?

00:56:53.699 --> 00:56:55.380 align:middle line:90%
So you're anchored in vision.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And then you do the cultivation.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm activating
the joy and the peace

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and the love, regardless
of the conditions.

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
the condition and go,

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:05.810 align:middle line:90%
what's that bringing up in me?

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:08.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, I'm
terrible, I'm a failure,

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm a loser, whatever it is.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I do the
stage six work.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Again, we're skipping over.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.807 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to embrace that part
of me and ask that part of me,

00:57:17.807 --> 00:57:18.890 align:middle line:90%
what's your lesson for me?

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:20.600 align:middle line:90%
What's your gift?

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.820 align:middle line:84%
What do you need from me to
become integrated into my life

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.600 align:middle line:90%
more fully?

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And it will start
to speak to you.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And it will say, I
need you to go play.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.734 align:middle line:90%
I need you to-- whatever.

00:57:31.734 --> 00:57:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It's different for everyone.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.441 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:34.350 align:middle line:90%
But you're saying--

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: But I do the work.

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
saying go into it.

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:39.610 align:middle line:90%
If there's an issue, go into it.

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:41.532 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Don't try
to get rid of it.

00:57:41.532 --> 00:57:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And a lot of
people are afraid of doing

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:45.464 align:middle line:84%
the regression or the
therapy because they

00:57:45.464 --> 00:57:47.130 align:middle line:84%
don't want to go
through the pain of it.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.796 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying it
doesn't necessarily

00:57:48.796 --> 00:57:50.180 align:middle line:90%
have to have the pain.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes it can.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.125 align:middle line:84%
But let the pain emerge so
that it can finally get out.

00:57:54.125 --> 00:57:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yeah.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And the pain is like
that forest fire.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the pain is necessary
because pain focuses us.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:03.140 align:middle line:84%
When there's pain,
you're like zhoop.

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:03.639 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:58:03.639 --> 00:58:04.611 align:middle line:90%
I've made a decision.

00:58:04.611 --> 00:58:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And so pain
happens for that reason.

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
to be suffering.

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Suffering is where
you're judging it.

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.620 align:middle line:90%
You're making it and you wrong.

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And you are resisting it.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.690 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to get
or get rid of something

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:19.840 align:middle line:90%
instead of embracing it.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the action
piece then is--

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that step five?

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: That's step five.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.890 align:middle line:90%
We skipped step four.

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But step four is really
whatever's missing

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:27.640 align:middle line:90%
is what you're not giving.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.545 align:middle line:90%
We've talked a lot about it.

00:58:28.545 --> 00:58:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you start
to look at where are you

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:32.190 align:middle line:90%
trying to get stuff from people?

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I show you
how to start first

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.640 align:middle line:84%
of all giving it to yourself
and then start activating it

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.590 align:middle line:84%
so that you're
radiating it even more.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And that reverses the flow
so that energetically you're

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:44.990 align:middle line:84%
no longer trying to get
anything from anyone.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.770 align:middle line:84%
You recognize that
you're the source.

00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And even when someone
gives you something,

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you know that it's not
really coming from them.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It's coming through them.

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:52.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not your source.

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.904 align:middle line:90%
They're your channel.

00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And it changes
transactional relationship

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:58.210 align:middle line:84%
into transformational
relationship.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And then stage five, act
as if you're already it.

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You now understand that
action is like affirmation

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:09.020 align:middle line:84%
in work clothes, that you
use your actions not so

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:84%
much again to try to
make something happen.

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But you go, if I really
was an abundant person--

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.320 align:middle line:90%
my vision is abundance.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling abundant.

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm creating a
life of abundance.

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.638 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the
grocery store and--

00:59:20.638 --> 00:59:22.846 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't have enough
money for anything now.

00:59:22.846 --> 00:59:25.179 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Or you really want
to get those organic apples

00:59:25.179 --> 00:59:26.190 align:middle line:90%
but they're $0.99 more.

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh,
I can't afford that.

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, that might be
a perfect opportunity

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.550 align:middle line:84%
to take a congruent action
and get those apples.

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:38.550 align:middle line:84%
As Deepak Chopra once said,
adopt a life of luxury and life

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.490 align:middle line:90%
will rise up to meet you.

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.960 align:middle line:84%
But you make actions
that are a match, again,

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.900 align:middle line:84%
not to make it happen--
I want to be clear.

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:47.770 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying
to achieve anything.

00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:49.727 align:middle line:90%
But faith without works is dead.

00:59:49.727 --> 00:59:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do it in
small ways so that it--

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Do it in small ways.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:52.859 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:52.859 --> 00:59:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to
walk on water right away.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:56.331 align:middle line:84%
But you're just
looking-- if somebody

00:59:56.331 --> 01:00:00.820 align:middle line:84%
was to peer in on your life
and turn the sound down,

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.850 align:middle line:84%
would they say, wow,
that person really

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:04.530 align:middle line:90%
believes they're abundant?

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Or would they go, you're
doing all these affirmations

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:08.310 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And then you're like, oh my god.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.290 align:middle line:90%
The economy's terrible.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.070 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough work,
so your conversation--

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the noise.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So you want to ask
that question, if somebody

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:19.960 align:middle line:84%
was to look at my life, would
they-- like if somebody was

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to have spied on me when
I was waiting on tables,

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.880 align:middle line:90%
they would have said, god.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.860 align:middle line:90%
He's like so into this job.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.320 align:middle line:90%
He loves his work.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.290 align:middle line:90%
He brings so much of himself.

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
He is like on fire with
excellence and inspiration.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:33.752 align:middle line:90%
And he's a real leader.

01:00:33.752 --> 01:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
I was bringing.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:35.860 align:middle line:90%
That was your work at the time.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And so I
was taking action.

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I was acting into the role.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.625 align:middle line:84%
And we become what
we pretend to be.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We've just got to
make sure we're

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.677 align:middle line:84%
pretending to be
who we really are.

01:00:44.677 --> 01:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if people want
to find the seven steps,

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
they can go to your
website, which is--

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Which is
DerekRydall.com.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Your name.

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL:
D-E-R-E-K-R-Y-D-A-L-L dot com.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Or just lawofemergence.com.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, for those that
really want this final step,

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.030 align:middle line:90%
what is the final step?

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: The final step.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
final-- recognize that--

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: You're going
to have to tune in later.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --within you that
need for that final step

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.226 align:middle line:90%
needs to emerge.

01:01:10.226 --> 01:01:11.192 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Yes.

01:01:11.192 --> 01:01:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, the final step, stage
seven, is wait upon the law.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
important stage in the sense

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that we might do
all of this work.

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.910 align:middle line:90%
We've planted the seed.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.820 align:middle line:90%
We've cultivated the soil.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We've watered it,
weeded it, feeded it,

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, prayed
over it, laid hands

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:33.340 align:middle line:84%
over it, danced around
it, done all the work,

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and have structure around
it, which is your plan.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's not growing.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.585 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And so
what the temptation

01:01:42.585 --> 01:01:46.512 align:middle line:84%
is is to dig up the seed and
go, what's wrong with this?

01:01:46.512 --> 01:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
look like in our life?

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It looks like dropping
back down vibrationally

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.950 align:middle line:84%
in your conversation,
in your actions,

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
reverting back to old habits
because it's not working.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Well,
it's not working,

01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:59.733 align:middle line:90%
so now you're complaining.

01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You're judging.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.540 align:middle line:90%
You're giving up.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.990 align:middle line:90%
You're falling off the path.

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And like the
Chinese bamboo tree,

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
you water it and weed it and
feed it for like five years

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and it grows like a half
an inch or something.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.242 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
fifth year-- and I

01:02:13.242 --> 01:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
might be getting my
years slightly wrong,

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:16.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's a long time.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Within about six
to eight weeks, it

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
grows eight or
nine stories tall.

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: So this
is the definition

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.130 align:middle line:90%
of an overnight success, right?

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And all of that time, it was
building a deep root system.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes what's
trying to grow up--

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cultivate, yeah.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.446 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: It needs also
to equally grow down.

01:02:35.446 --> 01:02:36.445 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

01:02:36.445 --> 01:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: Because the deeper the
roots, the higher the shoots,

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%
the richer the fruits.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of us want to
just grow our branches up

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
to the light.

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to grow
our roots down into the dark.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.813 align:middle line:84%
And you have a tree and a
little wind comes along,

01:02:49.813 --> 01:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
it just goes poof.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we have those-- the
patience of unanswered prayer.

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like you wait on the law.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's working.

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But you want to just keep
going into the feeling

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.760 align:middle line:84%
tone, the state, the
actions as if it's true.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the final thing
I'll say before we close

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.215 align:middle line:84%
is just that you hit
what I call thresholds.

01:03:10.215 --> 01:03:12.048 align:middle line:84%
And we already talked
a little bit about it.

01:03:12.048 --> 01:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's where all of the
reasons why you weren't living

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
this life already
start to come up.

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.555 align:middle line:84%
All the shadows, the patterns,
the values conflicts,

01:03:21.555 --> 01:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
all the reasons why you
think you didn't deserve it

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that's a
good thing, though.

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: It's a great thing.

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:26.515 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a great thing.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: You just have to
understand that's a threshold.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a boundary in
your consciousness.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And go
through it, over it.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And now you
have to work through it.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Stay with it.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you've messed up.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.655 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it's not working.

01:03:35.655 --> 01:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you need to
find a new seed or a new tool

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
or a new place to bury it.

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:42.562 align:middle line:84%
It means you're
actually growing.

01:03:42.562 --> 01:03:43.145 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

01:03:43.145 --> 01:03:44.728 align:middle line:84%
>>RYDALL: And you
have to do the work.

01:03:44.728 --> 01:03:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you
very much, Derek.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: You're welcome.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're fun to talk to.

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:49.301 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Likewise.

01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And fascinating
information.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RYDALL: Thank you.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.898 align:middle line:84%
