00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm
Lisa Garr, and welcome.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
the power of prayer

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on healing?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
My guest today has helped
change the face of medicine

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:84%
with his groundbreaking studies
on the scientific connection

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
between science
and spirituality.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Larry Dossey has provided
the scientific and medical

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:84%
proof that spiritual
dimensions work in healing.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Coming from his background as
an internal medicine doctor,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dossey has been able
to change the curriculum

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:90%
in hundreds of medical schools.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
His book, "Healing
Words," is now

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
a part of the curriculum
of medical schools.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And he is here
joining us to talk

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:84%
about the past, the present,
and the future of healing

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and medicine.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY DOSSEY:
Great to be here.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Lisa.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thanks for joining me.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:90%
So take us back to your days.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
Now your book is now in its
20th year, which is amazing.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Take me back to your
early days in medicine

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:84%
when you were talking
about prayer 20 years ago

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.504 align:middle line:90%
in medicine.

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
when I first began

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
talking about
prayer in medicine,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
this was not
exactly the best way

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:84%
to advance your
career in medicine.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it just
wasn't on the menu.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
It suggested something that
was absolutely outrageous,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that by praying or adopting
healing intentions,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
you could affect
somebody at a distance

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
when they didn't even
know you were doing this.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this just-- there
was no place for this.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But there was
something that happened

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:90%
that made all the difference.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with that
little four letter word-- data.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yes.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Because
back in the 1980s,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
people began to put
this idea to the test.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I will never forget in 1988
when a study was published out

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
of San Francisco
General Hospital looking

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
at the ability of prayer to
make a difference in almost

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:90%
400 patients with heart attack.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And the prayed-for
group did better.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked by that.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, you started
some of these studies.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
You were participating in
many of these studies, right?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I am a referee of the
studies, and I analyze them.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not a basic researcher.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So I look at the studies,
try to make sense of them

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.277 align:middle line:84%
and talk about them and explain
them to the professional.

00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:90%
That's been my task.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you curate them
so that you can bring them

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:90%
to the general public.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Curator-- I like that.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like that.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You're the curator of ideas.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
[BOTH LAUGH] More than
that, I mean, first of all

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:90%
let's qualify the word "prayer."

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
You're not talking about a
specific religion or a dogma.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- what is
prayer in your terms?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, in my way
of thinking about prayer,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
it's a communication
with the absolute.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And the absolute is my
term for God or Goddess

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.665 align:middle line:90%
or Allah or the divine.

00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Whatever
it means to you.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Whatever one's
tradition means to them.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So I go out of my way not to
mention specific connections

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:90%
with religion.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.482 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, one reason I
do this is because in all

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
of the studies that
have been done,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at the ability of
prayer to make a difference,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
there is no evidence that
any one specific religion

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.417 align:middle line:84%
has cornered the
market on prayer.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:21.416 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So I
like this finding.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it suggests
that we really

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
have to be tolerant of a great
variety of religious paths

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual traditions.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.644 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why do you use
the word "prayer" instead

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of "intention" or
"visualization" or "focus?"

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I find that
in America, where 90% of women

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
pray regularly and about 80% of
men, people understand prayer.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to go off talking
about "healing intentions,"

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:90%
they would say, what?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.543 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:53.886 align:middle line:90%
OK, I see.

00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:54.844 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: What is that?

00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:56.937 align:middle line:84%
So I just like to
talk in a language

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:57.895 align:middle line:90%
that people understand.

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:00.649 align:middle line:84%
And certainly people
understand-- in America,

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:90%
they understand what prayer is.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is true.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I saw a statistic
once come out saying

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.107 align:middle line:84%
some over 80% of people
in America believe in God.

00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: No, that's a
good statistic, yeah.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.981 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's
something you found as well.

00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So how does-- exactly
how does this work?

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
How does the power of prayer
effect lowering blood pressure,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
speeding up recovery
times after surgery,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
lowering the incidence
of heart attacks?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.797 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: There are
several mechanisms

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:90%
that have been proposed.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
One is just a simple
relaxation and feeling calm.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
People who enter into a
state of prayer or meditation

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
have long been known to have
good physiological responses

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
The blood pressure goes down.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Respirations tend to diminish.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Oxygen demand goes down.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Heart rate tends to fall.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of
the things that we've

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
known for a long time
about how prayer benefits

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:90%
the person who's praying.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting
question comes

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
when you inquire
about how prayer

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.955 align:middle line:84%
might affect somebody
else at a distance.

00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
what it does to you.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And so there are many theories
about how this sort of thing

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:90%
can work.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's only fair to say
that no one knows currently

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
what the explanation
will turn out to be.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The going popular notion is
that people are entangled.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept that comes
from quantum mechanics.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And even though things seem to
be divided and separate and far

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
apart, quantum
physics gives us a way

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
of understanding how things can
be separate and at a distance

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
yet behave as if
they are united.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.057 align:middle line:84%
The pop word is
"entanglement" in physics.

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Let me add, though,
that whether or not this

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is going to prove to be
the explanation for prayer

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:90%
is really up in the air.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just popular,
but we'll have

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to see what idea
floats to the top.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.549 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we're
going to explore

00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
all those today and
all sorts of theories

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.636 align:middle line:90%
of entanglement and studies.

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're doing today

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is bridging that gap between the
science and the spirituality.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So now, back when you
were practicing-- well,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
when you originally
wrote this book,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
there was a different era in
medicine back then, right?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
There was more of a
conventional era in medicine.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, this
idea that doctors

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
ought to explore using
prayer or healing

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
intentions with
their own patients

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
was considered
heresy and blasphemy.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I've actually known doctors--
I have a long list of doctors

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.220 align:middle line:84%
who have told me that
they had their hospital

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
privileges threatened to be
revoked because they were

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.791 align:middle line:84%
caught praying with a
patient at the bedside.

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are kidding.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: No, I'm not.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.309 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think
people today really

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
underestimate how controversial
this stuff was back

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s, '60s,
'70s, and so on.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Now it's sort of in the
air and in the water.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
People don't really
raise an eyebrow

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:90%
over this kind of thing.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't too long
ago where this was not so.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that was
the kind of the Era

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I of medicine, so to speak.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And then there
there's another era,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
as you've graduated
through the last 20

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
years, Era II of medicine.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, I use Era I to designate
the mechanical approach

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to things such as the use of
drugs and surgical procedures.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Those are very mechanical.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But then around World War II,
shortly thereafter, Era II

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:90%
came on board.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's mind-body medicine.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And today, people adapt
to this quite naturally.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's enrolled
in a meditation or yoga

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:90%
class it seems.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And imagery and
visualization are

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
accepted as pretty
important aspects of--

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Around what
decade was that?

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: The late
1940s and early 1950s.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.994 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: But these
things in those days

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.475 align:middle line:84%
were indeed also
very controversial.

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But now they've
just sort of been

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:84%
incorporated into
conventional medicine.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The exciting thing
is where we begin

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to talk about prayer and
distant intentions and so on.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And that gets us
into what I call

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Era III, or non-local
medicine, which we'll discuss.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well the Era III
Medicine is what we're in now.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
This is why your book is able
to come out and be a number one

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
bestseller for-- when it
was originally released.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.021 align:middle line:84%
And it stayed on the bestseller
list for a long time.

00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:22.395 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you have
a little story

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
you told us about that,
which was fascinating to me,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:90%
about the book.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I had
written a couple of books

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:84%
about the role of
consciousness in health.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And so these were published
without too much indigestion

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:90%
by my publisher.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
But when I presented them
with the book on prayer,

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:90%
they refused to publish it.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reasoning was that you
can't sell a book on prayer.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection between
prayer and healing and science.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%
The whole idea is crazy.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.912 align:middle line:84%
So I wound up overnight
without a publisher.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because they
wouldn't publish it.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: No.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was
an idiotic theme,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.125 align:middle line:90%
the arguments were crazy.

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:84%
They weren't interested
in the science,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
even though the
science was there,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
even randomized
controlled studies.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:90%
This was just off the table.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So I wound up finding a
blessed, open-minded publisher

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.004 align:middle line:90%
to publish the book.

00:09:21.004 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And they published it.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned--
thank you--

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
it wound up on the New
York Times Bestseller List.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and the rest
is history on that one.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So what is what you consider
the definition of spirituality

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:90%
in medicine?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:90%
How does that translate?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think
a definition that

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
would go down pretty
easily for most people is

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that spirituality is a sense of
being connected with something

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
greater than the
individual self.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Whether that
transcendent being is something

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
people want to call God or
Goddess or Allah or the Divine

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.075 align:middle line:84%
But it's different
from religion.

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:01.033 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's different.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Religion tends to
be a codified system of belief

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and behavior that people
engage in in a congregation.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They come together with
people of like-minded belief.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
can be spiritual

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:90%
without being religious.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I think I know a
lot of people who

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
are religious who
don't seem to have

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:90%
much spirituality about them.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It would be interesting
to see the trends on that,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:90%
how that is trending now.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken with
many, many guests that

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
have said the same thing,
that there is a drifting away,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
especially with young
children, of teaching

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:84%
them the organized religion
that they were raised with

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and raising them with more of
a moralistic, spiritual concept

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:90%
around the face of morality.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And I am the same way.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I do the same thing.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I have a young child.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we're raising
her with what

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.696 align:middle line:84%
it means to be a good
person and also God.

00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's concepts
around then.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.945 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
doing the same thing,

00:10:58.945 --> 00:11:01.864 align:middle line:84%
yet there's also a lot of people
in organized religion as well.

00:11:01.864 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, that's true.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.904 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to say that people

00:11:04.904 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
can be religious and spiritual,
and spiritual and religious.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to put
these things in a box

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and say you can't be both.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are both.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
This is important, because if
you look at the studies looking

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
at people's intentions
to heal someone else,

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.547 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
what you call it.

00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Whether
you use a language

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that involves "thee" and "thou"
or whether you pray to God

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
or whether you don't
consider yourself

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
affiliated with a religion
at all, a lot of the studies

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
show that people
who are absolutely

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
unaffiliated with religion
can achieve success

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:90%
in these healing studies.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So we come back again
and again to the idea

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that no specific religion has
a monopoly on these healing

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
intentions or prayer.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if no
specific religion

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
has the monopoly on
it, and spirituality

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
is an overarching theme
around it, the way that you

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
have quantified that this
actually affects people,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
in your practice for example,
give me an example of,

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
in your practice,
how this had worked.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, the first
example that comes to mind

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is an experience I had
during my medical training

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:90%
in internal medicine.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient in
the hospital who

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
was an elderly man who
was a heavy smoker.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:90%
He was in his 80s.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And he had metastatic
lung cancer.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
to be done for this.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
He opted to have no
therapy, which was smart,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
because no therapy worked in
those days for this problem.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
The only therapy he had, if
you want to call it a therapy,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
is that the congregation
from his church

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
came and ringed his bedside
at all visiting hours

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and prayed nonstop for this guy.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that time in my life,
I was not impressed by this.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to go home to die.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I discharged
him at his wish.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And a year later, he showed
back up at the hospital

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:90%
with a bad case of the flu.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I did another
chest x-ray on him,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:90%
and it was perfectly clear.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
This man recovered from
metastatic, lethal lung cancer,

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and the only therapy that he
was exposed to was prayer.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:90%
This really got my attention.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As his doctor.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: As his physician.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.768 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to do with this.

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So I repressed it, you know,
things you can't figure out

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and you get sort of
messed around about,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.470 align:middle line:90%
you just sort of deny them.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.164 align:middle line:90%
I'm good at denial.

00:13:34.164 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, as
a physician, when

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
your world is about science,
I'm sure a lot of other doctors

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:84%
are in that same-- they don't
know what to do with it.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It can't be quantified.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.462 align:middle line:84%
This was a spontaneous
remission, and dismiss it.

00:13:44.462 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, that's right.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And years later, the thing
that really got my attention,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
as I've already mentioned,
are the randomized controlled

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
studies on prayer
and healing that

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
began to be done in a serious
way in modern hospitals.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned one that was
done at San Francisco General

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Hospital in the
Coronary Care Unit.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I had patients
in the Coronary Care Unit

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And so here's what I thought.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought, if there's
anything to this controlled,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
double-blind study
showing that prayer seems

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to work in coronary patients,
and I'm not doing it,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:90%
do I have a problem with that?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, am I denying
my patients something

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:90%
that might be helpful?

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I got really
concerned about that.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
The way of resolving
that crisis for me

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
was to look at the
world's literature, trying

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to find other studies
that had to do with this.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought I might uncover
two or three extra ones

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't heard about.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
I came up with 130.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And 2/3 of them show that there
is a positive effect from this.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I began to think this
is the best kept secret

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:90%
in modern medicine.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to adapt
prayer for all my patients.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the book
got published, by the way,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and written, looking at
the data, not just stories,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
not just anecdotes,
but combining

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
the scientific research
with the stories.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's how "Healing
Words" came to be.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.425 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And did you pray at
the bedside of these patients?

00:15:16.425 --> 00:15:19.021 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I invented my
own private prayer ritual.

00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I would go into my
office early in the morning,

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
earlier than usual,
close my door,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and have my own private
prayer ritual that I invented.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.217 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which was?

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Oh, well, you
really want to know?

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.591 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, over
the years, my patients

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
knew I was interested in
the anthropology of healing.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
given me as gifts

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:84%
various shamanic rattles
and various herbal incenses

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I concocted
my own ritual where

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I would burn incense that
shamans and healers were using

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
around the world
and shake my rattles

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and say my healing request
and prayers for my patients

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that I would be seeing on
hospital rounds that morning

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and who would be coming
to my office that day.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And I continued
this ritual until I

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
retired from the practice
of internal medicine.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That blows my mind.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
What was it like when
you were in the office?

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dossey's in, and
here's the rattles

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.339 align:middle line:90%
and-- and you got the-- [LAUGHS]

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, actually
I went in so early

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.754 align:middle line:84%
that I was about the
only person there.

00:16:26.754 --> 00:16:28.966 align:middle line:84%
I was not likely
to be interrupted.

00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you an
interesting experience

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:90%
along those lines.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
One morning I burned too
much incense in my ritual,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and the smoke alarm went off.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was paid a visit
by the fire inspector

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital who wanted to
know what that funny smell was.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, no. [LAUGHS] Well,
my father was a physician.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he
would go into rounds,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and he would sometimes
dread going into the rounds.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.794 align:middle line:90%
And it would take a lot of time.

00:16:54.794 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But he would spend a lot of time
with his patients and so forth.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But never once do I think he
went in and burned sage and did

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.150 align:middle line:90%
the shamanic ritual.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:90%
Did it work?

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I am
convinced that it did.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't make a public
to-do about this.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Because one never knows
precisely where your patients

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:84%
are religiously or spiritually,
and because I was positive

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that prayer could
work at a distance.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
I felt pretty confident
doing this in solitude

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
in the privacy of my own office
on behalf of my patients.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it must
have, in some way-- did

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
you want to quantify
it in some way?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see the patients
that you prayed for more?

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Because you read the studies.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I did.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, those studies
are done more easily

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
in academic environments where
one has a huge staff that

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.400 align:middle line:84%
can be involved in
gathering data and so on.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to do that just

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
in a single doctor's
private practice.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I knew most of the
people who were

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
doing the research,
however, by that time.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.932 align:middle line:84%
And I had great confidence
in their ability to do that.

00:18:01.932 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's amazing,
though, because now there

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.339 align:middle line:84%
are so many more doctors
who are alternative.

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I guess I can't even use
the word "alternative"--

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:90%
integrative.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is definitely a
rising trend in medicine.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Andrew Weil says it's
the future of medicine.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you do as well,
integrative medicine.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is what you
were doing 20 years ago.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I recently read
that there are actually

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:84%
more visits to
alternative practitioners

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:84%
now than there are to
actual medical doctors.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, that's
a valid statistic.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one reason
that the medical schools have

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:90%
come on board.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, it has to do
with the economics of medicine.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
When more patients are going
to so-called alternative

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
practitioners than
conventional doctors,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of money
going out the front door.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And so doctors have become
interested in this on economics

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
alone, in addition to the fact
that these things may actually

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:90%
have benefit for patients.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.025 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then why isn't
insurance covering it more?

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: That's a
tremendous question.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it is
only a matter of time

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
until insurance companies
wake up to the fact

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that these things have economic
payoff for the insurance

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
One reason I say that is that
people who follow some sort

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual or religious path
in their life live on average 7

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.797 align:middle line:84%
to 13 years longer
than people who don't.

00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.921 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: And here's the thing.

00:19:35.921 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:84%
This is where the insurance
companies will be looking,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:90%
be paying attention.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
In the process, people
have a lower incidence

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of all the major diseases,
including heart disease

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and cancer, if they
follow some sort

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.415 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual or religious
path in their life.

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So the
insurance companies

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.821 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to gain by paying
attention to this kind of data.

00:19:57.821 --> 00:19:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's been
around-- that data's

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:84%
been around for 10
years almost now.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Actually
longer than that.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Longer than that, yeah.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: It's been out there.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But old habits
are hard to break.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when the
systems are ingrained.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Absolutely.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and
they're big systems, too.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, so there is a link
between spirituality

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and integrative health care
that you understand, yes.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:90%
And we have a slide about that.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Explain that, that link.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, spirituality
and alternative health care

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:90%
do go together.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:90%
And the question is why.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
There are surveys
that show that people

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
who choose to go to
so-called alternative

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
or complementary or
integrative practitioners

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
have had some sort of change
in the way they see the world.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Many talk about a
transformational experience

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:90%
about how they see things.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:90%
They see themselves integrated.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves part
of a larger pattern.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And people, after
having this kind

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
of awakening about how
they are in the world,

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
are looking for doctors
who represent or are

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
cordial to that way
of looking at things.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And most people who
have this point of view

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
see in alternative
therapists a point of view

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that's more compatible
with the way

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
they see things and the way they
experience being in the world

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
than they see being represented
by conventional doctors who

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.185 align:middle line:84%
use only or mainly drugs
and surgical procedures.

00:21:23.185 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So people sort
of sort themselves out

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of doctor
that they feel at home with,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:90%
is what it amounts to.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.023 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And usually the doctor has had
that same type of experience

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:84%
where they've had a spiritual
awakening or some type

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
of awakening or something that
dawned on them that they need

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to soften that or transition
that level of their practice.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why
"Healing Words" is now

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.220 align:middle line:84%
used in how many of the medical
schools now as a textbook?

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there
are dozens of them.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
A fact I always come back to is
that when the book was written,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.570 align:middle line:84%
out of the 125 medical
schools in the country,

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
only three had any
formal coursework looking

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:84%
at the connection between
spirituality and healing.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And now, since the
book has been out

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and has been used here
and there, over 90

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
of the nation's
128 medical schools

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:84%
now feature course work looking
at the role of spirituality

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
and affecting health care.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Spirituality
and alternative.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this has
been definitely--

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a slide here that talks
about a survey of physicians.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And so now doctors are starting
to accept more this concept

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
of prayer in-- specifically
prayer and the concept

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.327 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality as an
umbrella in medicine.

00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I'm really
glad you bring this up,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:84%
because when I was going
through medical school,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.917 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that
good doctors don't

00:22:45.917 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:90%
believe any of this stuff.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It's mechanical
stuff all the way.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
It's drugs and
surgical procedures.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's the opposite.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So this is
a myth that doctors

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
don't believe in a connection
between spirituality

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:84%
The surveys show that
3/4 of physicians

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
believe in spiritual effects,
even including miracle cures.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of them pray
for their patients

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
as a group or
individually, thereabouts.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole idea that
doctors don't believe anything

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
about the role of
spirituality in healing

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:84%
is just a myth that really
needs to be put to rest.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's definitely
above the 50% level.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:84%
This is well into many,
many of these physicians.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.535 align:middle line:84%
And if physicians
are watching this,

00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:84%
this helps them
identify with the fact

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that there is--
it's not just them

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
who believes in these
types of things.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's a lot more
nutritional information now

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:90%
in medical schools.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
My father is a medical
doctor, and he has now

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:84%
gone back to study nutrition,
because it wasn't there when

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
he studied it, and
originally because it's

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:84%
more so about the
mind-body-spirit connection.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely all altogether.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So did you at the time--
what type of criticism

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
were you experiencing when
you had-- when you brought

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
this book out a long time
ago, when you launched it?

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there
were a considerable number

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of physicians who developed an
enormous amount of intellectual

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:90%
indigestion--

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's funny.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --over
this kind of thing.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
But that was early on.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that
it is rare when

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I talk to doctors
at medical schools

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and hospitals for anyone
to object to any of this.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to
talk to tens of thousands

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of doctors in a year's
time about these issues.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Almost no one objects anymore.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
reason is that it's

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
really tough to deny
the power of the data.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And most doctors may be
willing to say, well,

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
the data may be true,
but I just don't

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
feel good about doing
this with my patients.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.562 align:middle line:90%
That's their choice.

00:25:00.562 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
should be honored.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But most physicians
have integrated this

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.600 align:middle line:84%
into their practice
and the interaction

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.917 align:middle line:90%
with patients to some degree.

00:25:08.917 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember
you once telling me

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that you used to speak at
the medical conventions,

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and that when your
lecture would come up,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:90%
the room would be fairly empty.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you saw it
grow and grow and grow.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And this was the interest
being piqued by the doctors.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember telling me that?

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I do.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.998 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's interesting
to talk about these issues

00:25:26.998 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:84%
with groups of doctors, because
the same thing always happens.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
After the talk is over
and people are filing out,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
there are always a few doctors
who come up to the podium,

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and they will say
things like, well, you

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:84%
think what you talked
about is weird,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you what I've
seen with my patients.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
And so the stories come forth.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I collect those
and occasionally

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.391 align:middle line:90%
use them in my own writing.

00:25:54.391 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Can I give you one
that happened recently?

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, definitely.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It had to do with a
talk I gave about premonitions.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I revealed to the
doctors my own experiences.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the Q&A session, a
female internist stood up

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and she said, well,
I get numbers.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:90%
I get numbers in my dreams.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.210 align:middle line:84%
She said, I see the specific
values of my patients' lab

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.568 align:middle line:84%
tests before I even
order the tests.

00:26:24.568 --> 00:26:25.526 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:26:25.526 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So this
is the sort of thing

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that doctors can
come forward with,

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
quite interesting.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it shows this-- if
you give doctors a safe place

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to talk about weird
experiences, whether prayer,

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
distant healing,
and so on, you may

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
be surprised what
they come up with.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I think most doctors
have a long laundry

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:84%
list of these experiences
with their patients

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that they're just reluctant
to talk about publicly.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But they will under
certain circumstances.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You told me about
another doctor friend of yours

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:90%
who is an OB/GYN.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And he
believes-- how does he

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
use that power of premonition?

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Which is actually another
one of Dr. Dossey's books.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well he has a
strange sensation in his chest

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
every time one of his
patients is about to deliver.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And this never fails.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And he has a
premonition about when

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
the baby's coming
that's connected

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:90%
with a bodily symptom.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Now this seems really bizarre,
but this is in the literature.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
This does take place.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's an indicator
that premonitions

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
are valid if they're associated
with a bodily symptom.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:84%
This proves to be so reliable
that the nurses on the OB/GYN

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
floor of the hospital where he
works tell each other, well,

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
if you're uncertain when she's
going to deliver her baby, just

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.265 align:middle line:84%
call Dr. So-and-So up and ask
him how his chest is feeling.

00:27:54.265 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
actually has proven

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:90%
to be right that many times.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.465 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So they use
this as a clinical sign

00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
of when the woman's
going to deliver.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.866 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, let's
go into that more.

00:28:01.866 --> 00:28:06.595 align:middle line:84%
So 59% of doctors pray for
their patients individually.

00:28:06.595 --> 00:28:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Mhm.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 59%.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
survey that was done.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:84%
51% pray for
patients as a group.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So in a group setting, they
pay-- pray for their patients?

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.277 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: They'll pray for
their patients collectively.

00:28:20.277 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: They'll pray
for the best outcome

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.476 align:middle line:84%
or for a specific thing
to happen as a group.

00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't single them out.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But they pray privately
for their patients

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.700 align:middle line:90%
as a collective whole.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then 42%
encourage patients

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:90%
to pray for themselves.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yes, and they do it,
not just to give something--

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.010 align:middle line:84%
give their patient
something to do,

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:84%
but they do it because they
think prayer is likely to work.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are very
pragmatic people.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:90%
They use what works.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They'll generally throw the
kitchen sink at anything

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.830 align:middle line:84%
if they think there's
a chance it might work.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So the reason over half of
doctors pray for their patients

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
or encourage them to pray for
themselves is because they

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:84%
think there's good
data suggesting

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:90%
that this can be effective.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.312 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
zero side effects as well.

00:29:12.312 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the beautiful
part about it.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.394 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I'm glad
you brought that up.

00:29:15.394 --> 00:29:17.322 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As opposed
to other things.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So there has, as
you would say, there

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:84%
has been a re-spiritualization
of medicine in your experience.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: There's
no doubt about it.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I've already mentioned
that almost none

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of the medical
schools 20 years ago

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:90%
had anything to do with this.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Now the great majority do.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are openly acknowledging
that they make a place

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in their life, in
their practice life,

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
for prayer and
healing intentions.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:90%
So there's no going back.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
keep coming back to,

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, is because of the data.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.737 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's just no
getting around the facts.

00:29:53.737 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that
is some of the data

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.778 align:middle line:84%
that I actually
want to talk about.

00:29:56.778 --> 00:29:59.719 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into this and
what some of the-- as we've

00:29:59.719 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
talked about it a lot,
and we've quoted it a lot,

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.990 align:middle line:84%
but what are some of the
actual scientific studies?

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We're actually going
to go through that

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:90%
in just a little bit.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.604 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to talk a
little more about as doctors

00:30:10.604 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
are watching you, and
as patients are watching

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
this right now, and
they're understanding

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that there could be some more
permission for this to happen

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, do
you see the practices

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and do you see hospitals
responding to this?

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you see hospitals
creating programs or systems

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:90%
around prayer used in healing?

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there
are many hospital systems

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:84%
across the country who
go out of their way

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to integrate this on
an inpatient basis.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And they-- the reason
they-- and the way

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:84%
they usually go about it is
through hospital chaplains

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and pastoral counselors.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Many
institutions are still

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.680 align:middle line:84%
very wary of making this
something that doctors do.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But doctors don't
have to do this.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.987 align:middle line:90%
People can pray for themselves.

00:31:00.987 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.028 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: You can
encourage friends

00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and loved ones to pray for
you if you're a patient.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
responsive groups

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:84%
in the whole country to this
emerging body of information

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:14.261 align:middle line:84%
has been hospital chaplains
and pastoral counselors.

00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, I'm sure.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.926 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I have the
opportunity to talk

00:31:16.926 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to groups of these at
their national meetings.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And they seem extraordinarily
grateful that science

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
has given them some ammunition
in the form of control studies

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that when people pray,
they're not fooling themselves

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:90%
into thinking this works.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:38.002 align:middle line:84%
There's actual information in
the form of data confirming it.

00:31:38.002 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about some of that.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of the studies--
and this is as recent

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:49.700 align:middle line:84%
as 2010-- around major
randomized controlled clinical

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
trials of distant
healings and so forth.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.308 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about those?

00:31:53.308 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
my favorite study

00:31:55.230 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
is one that was done by a
famous researcher in the imagery

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and visualization field,
Dr. Jean Achterberg.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
She was recruited to
the Big Island of Hawaii

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:84%
by a funder who had
built this hospital.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was interested,
fantastically interested,

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:90%
in healing.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So she recruited
11 native healers

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Hawaii
healer community.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And she invited him them to
go out and select a patient

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to work with, that they felt
really empathic and loving

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:90%
and very close and caring with.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And so she did one
of these fancy what

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:41.100 align:middle line:84%
are called fMRI studies, the
Functional Magnetic Resonance

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Imaging study of the brain.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it worked.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.220 align:middle line:84%
The patient's head
or brain was being

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:84%
scanned at the time the healer
was sending prayer or healing

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:84%
intentions, whatever
they called it.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And these healing
intention periods

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:84%
were interspersed with periods
when they didn't do anything.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And only during the period when
the healer was doing healing,

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:84%
the brain of the subject
lit up in the fMRI scanner,

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
indicating increased
metabolic activity

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.790 align:middle line:84%
only when the healer
was doing her thing.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And this happened in
10 of the 11 subjects.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
This is an astonishing
study, really,

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
because I think it just
demolishes the idea that prayer

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is just positive thinking or
placebo effects and so on.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The odds against a
chance explanation

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:84%
of this phenomenon in that
study was less than one chance

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
in 10,000.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So this is
the sort of precision

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that's being brought to looking
at the effects of prayer

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember you told me
about at Duke University there

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:84%
were a number of studies
were done on, well,

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:84%
specifically on control groups
where patients were prayed for

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and those that were
not prayed for.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about
some of those results?

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, the study was
done by Dr. Mitchell Krucoff

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.010 align:middle line:90%
and in his team.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And in their initial
study, they found

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that there was a major
decrease in side effects,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
such as bleeding and
cardiac arrhythmias,

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
in patients who were undergoing
cardiac bypass surgery.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I must say, however, that
studies to replicate that

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.510 align:middle line:84%
particular study
often have not worked.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The most famous study has been
done at Harvard Medical School

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.949 align:middle line:84%
in 1,800 patients undergoing
cardiac bypass surgery.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It was an extremely
confusing study.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
reason it did not work

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is because it
tried to use prayer

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:84%
in a way in which it is
never used anywhere on Earth.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.739 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I don't want
to be too complex about this,

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:84%
but very briefly, one third
of these 1,800 patients

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.260 align:middle line:84%
were told that they
would be given prayer,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and they were given prayer.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:90%
They were prayed for.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: A third were told
you might be prayed for

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
or you might not be.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And they were prayed for.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And a third were told, you
might get prayer, maybe not.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And they were not prayed for.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would think that
the group that would do best

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:84%
if prayer works was this first
group who were guaranteed they

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
were going to get prayed for
and they were prayed for.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, this
group did the worst of all.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:84%
They had the highest incidence
of side effects following

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:90%
cardiac bypass surgery.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: So what happened here?

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:84%
My interpretation of
this is that it violated

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
what's called ecological
validity, which

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
means that it
tried to use prayer

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:90%
unlike it's used in real life.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
If you went to your
mother's bedside tonight,

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and she was scheduled to have
bypass surgery tomorrow, you

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.465 align:middle line:84%
would not say,
mom, I know you're

00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
going to have a big
operation tomorrow,

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just not sure I'm
going to pray for you.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: You would not do this.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely not.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: It would be inhumane.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.631 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: But this is what
was done, essentially,

00:35:59.631 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in 2/3 of these patients
in the Harvard study.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask
yourself, well, maybe that

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
stirred up some emotions that
are not healthy in people.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.056 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the people who
weren't sure they were going--

00:36:13.056 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:84%
they were gonna
get prayer or not

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:84%
would have recruited extra
prayer from outside, from loved

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:90%
ones and friends.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they would double
down on their own self prayer.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So this study was absolutely
confused, in my opinion.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's had a terrible
effect, because a lot of people

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:84%
say, well, Harvard
disproved that prayer works.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a complete
misinterpretation of the facts.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, indeed
there are studies

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that of course
show the opposite.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.185 align:middle line:90%
And there's many of them.

00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there
are many of them.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:84%
By my count, there are 22
major studies in humans.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
At least half of these show
statistically significant

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
results.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:84%
If you enlarge that to look
at the effects of prayer

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and healing intentions on
animals and plants and so,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.230 align:middle line:84%
there are over 200 of these
studies, most of which

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:90%
are positive.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.786 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to actually
ask you about that.

00:37:02.786 --> 00:37:04.744 align:middle line:84%
The plants and the
animals and so forth.

00:37:04.744 --> 00:37:06.160 align:middle line:84%
There were studies
that I remember

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.960 align:middle line:84%
being done on funguses,
on plant growth.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.672 align:middle line:84%
These are things that people
can do at home, which I love.

00:37:12.672 --> 00:37:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: You can
try this at home.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can
try this at home.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I recommended you
try this at home.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about those.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.278 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well as
a matter of fact,

00:37:19.278 --> 00:37:23.966 align:middle line:84%
these are my favorite studies,
which may sound surprising.

00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Why not do all these
studies on people?

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
concerned with.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason is that if you
do a study on animals-- rats,

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:84%
mice, plants, growth rates
of bacteria in test tubes

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of thing--
and the study is positive,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:84%
you can't explain
it away by saying

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:84%
it was just the
placebo response.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.833 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Or it just happened
because of positive thinking.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.337 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, bacteria
don't think positively.

00:37:49.337 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right?

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.306 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So if you
get a positive study

00:37:52.306 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
in the creatures, you've
really got some big stuff here.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.852 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
explain it away--

00:37:58.852 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Something more valid.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --by calling
it the placebo response.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
were the studies?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.693 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about-- I mean,

00:38:05.693 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:90%
just a couple of them,.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there was one
study looking at the healing

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:15.500 align:middle line:84%
rates of surgical
wounds in mice.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.280 align:middle line:90%
And I don't justify--

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Animals testing, yeah.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: --animal testing.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But this is just part of
the history of this field.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.719 align:middle line:84%
And those animals that were
prayed for healed up faster.

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure the
healing rate of surgical wounds

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:90%
very precisely.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a treatment group

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that was not prayed
for increased healing

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:90%
and versus the one that was.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And as in most of these
studies, the group that got

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.610 align:middle line:84%
prayed for healed up
quicker than the group that

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.940 align:middle line:90%
did not receive healing prayer.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.000 align:middle line:90%
The bacteria are interesting.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that there's a
huge variety of living things,

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:84%
living organisms, that
respond to prayer.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
When you pray for
an increased growth

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.386 align:middle line:84%
rate in the bacteria in these
test tubes and not these,

00:39:01.386 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:84%
these grow faster,
statistically speaking,

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.820 align:middle line:90%
in the majority of studies.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I love this.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it says this
is a general principle

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
throughout nature of response
to healing intentions in prayer.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:90%
No, that's really interesting.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever tried this at
home with yourself, with plants,

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.135 align:middle line:90%
and I mean you probably have a--

00:39:19.135 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Oh, I pray for
my plants all the time.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.387 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --a
greenhouse, don't you?

00:39:22.387 --> 00:39:22.886 align:middle line:90%
You must.

00:39:22.886 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, I'm an obsessive
pray-er for my-- all the living

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:90%
things around my house.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.316 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can imagine.

00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Actually, I've had
some interesting experiences

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
when I sometimes
pray for animals.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Recently coyotes had begun
to come outside my window

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:90%
when I'm doing this.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And they look in and
fix me with their gaze

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:84%
while I'm engaged in
meditation and prayer

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
for living things around
the house, my plants,

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the birds at the feeders,
and all this kind of thing.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.051 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they
sense it and know it.

00:39:57.051 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now in the
studies that were

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:84%
done-- that's a great thing
to try at home, by the way.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:84%
In the studies that were
done around the plants,

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.064 align:middle line:84%
can you us a little
about the statistics that

00:40:06.064 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%
were done with some growing more
than others, the prayed for,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.320 align:middle line:90%
not prayed for?

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, these
are very easy to do.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And just to speak generally,
the plants that are prayed for,

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.260 align:middle line:84%
generally the seeds
germinate faster

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.910 align:middle line:90%
than the un-prayed-for seeds.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The seedlings after
they germinate

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
grow faster than those
that are not prayed for.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I actually have
several children who

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.320 align:middle line:84%
have done science projects
in the eighth grade who

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.100 align:middle line:84%
have done these germination
experiments and the seedling

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.270 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
What these kids do is
to plant their seeds

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and put a string down the middle
and just pray for the seeds

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
on this side of the string
and not the other ones.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
take serial pictures.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And they send me the pictures.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And almost invariably,
it's the prayed-for seeds

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:90%
that germinate faster.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.550 align:middle line:84%
One little girl said that she
wasn't sure about this prayer

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
stuff, so in her experiment,
she recruited a nun

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.536 align:middle line:90%
to pray along with her.

00:41:10.536 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] She
didn't want to do it.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: She wanted
to make that she got--

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was done right.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: She got plenty
of good, solid prayer

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.664 align:middle line:90%
in her experiment.

00:41:19.664 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great idea.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have to
be in eighth grade science

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You can definitely
do that at home.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.398 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:41:25.398 --> 00:41:26.897 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So take a
plant and put it

00:41:26.897 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in your window and pray
for, and another one

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and let the sun do its work,
and see which one grows.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:90%
No, that's a great idea.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm personally blown away
by the statistics around it

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and the science that
has been done around it.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a lot
to be gained and to learn.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, though,
for sharing that,

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.429 align:middle line:84%
because it's the science
that I'm looking for.

00:41:46.429 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
a lot more of this.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to share a lot more
of these scientific studies.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.816 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break,

00:41:51.816 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to learn
about what you did.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a Hawaiian
study that was done.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.493 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts
of different things.

00:41:57.493 --> 00:42:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the one that
applied to me the most

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:84%
was about the funguses
and the plants.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.965 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said,
those are definitely

00:42:05.965 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:90%
double blind studies.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:84%
They are control-- they can't
be subject to the-- your int--

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.802 align:middle line:84%
well, it can't be subject
to their intentions.

00:42:14.802 --> 00:42:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: That's the
message there, yeah.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:84%
When we come back,
we're going to talk

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.870 align:middle line:90%
about more of the studies.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.286 align:middle line:84%
Because I just
don't think you can

00:42:22.286 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:84%
talk about this enough
around the science

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and the studies that are
done around the effectiveness

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:90%
of prayer and healing.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.340 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is
Dr. Larry Dossey,

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.290 align:middle line:84%
who's really
responsible for bridging

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.619 align:middle line:84%
that gap between
science and spirituality

00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:41.660 align:middle line:90%
in the medical community.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:84%
He really changed the face
of medicine by the studies

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that he's brought about on
the effectiveness of prayer

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.855 align:middle line:84%
He's also known as the "prayer
pioneer," affectionately known

00:42:51.855 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:90%
as the "prayer pioneer."

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking before
the break about studies

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.030 align:middle line:84%
around how prayer is
completely effective in healing

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:04.300 align:middle line:84%
plants, animals, funguses,
people-- double blind,

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:84%
randomized studies
that have been done,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.639 align:middle line:84%
clinical studies
that have been done

00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:90%
over the past several decades.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And you've really been
responsible in bringing

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.020 align:middle line:90%
this about.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:84%
How about the idea
of remote healing?

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Can that be used to help someone
if they're in the hospital

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and you pray for them when
you're in a different location?

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, most
of these studies

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.270 align:middle line:84%
actually have
involved healers who

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.490 align:middle line:90%
were not on site at the bedside.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And so
these, by and large,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.590 align:middle line:90%
are studies in remote healing.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, the reason that
physicians and researchers

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:84%
do the remote thing is that if
you're standing at the bedside,

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.340 align:middle line:84%
the patient knows you're there,
you know, and so this stirs up

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.000 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of positive thinking.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And the skeptics
can say, well, it

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the prayer
that did anything.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The person knew you
were praying for them,

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and they just wanted
to help it along,

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and so nothing is happening
as far as the prayer.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.475 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a praying
individual off 50,

00:44:02.475 --> 00:44:05.950 align:middle line:84%
100 miles away,
and the stuff works

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:08.710 align:middle line:84%
when the individual doesn't
even know it's happening,

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:84%
then you've really
got something there.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:11.546 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so funny.

00:44:11.546 --> 00:44:13.610 align:middle line:84%
There is such a need
for the skeptics.

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.290 align:middle line:84%
There really is a
need for the skeptics.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I look at this as something
to scientifically quantify

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
something that I instinctively
already know and have

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.600 align:middle line:90%
used and tried all of my life.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who's ever prayed
to God knows that it works.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:27.850 align:middle line:90%
But this is great.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:84%
No, it's really great to
validate this within science.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.109 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I so
appreciate what you've done.

00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:34.732 align:middle line:84%
But you have used this all
your life, haven't you?

00:44:34.732 --> 00:44:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I have.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.130 align:middle line:84%
See, I grew up in an
intensely religious community

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.340 align:middle line:90%
in central Texas.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.750 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just the Bible Belt.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
We called it the Buckle
of the Bible Belt.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Everybody just accepted that
this was the way it was.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't stick on me.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went away to
university and medical school,

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and I became a self-respecting
agnostic atheist

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and bought into the idea
of complete materialistic

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:90%
approaches to healing.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that no
good doctor believed

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in any of this California
woo-woo healing intention

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I bought that
for several years

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
until I began to regrow
my own spiritual roots

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and actually just had a
violent encounter in 1988 when

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:84%
the first randomized
controlled study of prayer that

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.560 align:middle line:84%
was really high
quality was published.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.440 align:middle line:90%
And it really got my attention.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a comfortable
experience for me, either.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't
seem like it would.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.960 align:middle line:90%
You were angry about it?

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I thought,
who in their right mind

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.870 align:middle line:84%
would study prayer
like you would

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.720 align:middle line:84%
a new medication,
control group that

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.810 align:middle line:84%
didn't get the therapy and
a treatment group that did?

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
troubled by that.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.146 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:45:54.146 --> 00:45:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
because I thought

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I'd dealt with that in my
spiritual religious past

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.870 align:middle line:90%
and had put that to bed.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And here is this Dr. Randolph
Byrd at San Francisco General

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Hospital who has come forward
to do this audacious study

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:13.550 align:middle line:84%
with these preposterous findings
that this stuff appeared

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:14.650 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was uncomfortable
with it because I

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any
inclination to use this.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
prayed for my patients

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.437 align:middle line:84%
on a bet at that
time in my life.

00:46:27.437 --> 00:46:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.353 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: But you know,
you confront these things,

00:46:30.353 --> 00:46:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and you have to ask, well, if
the stuff works and I'm not

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:84%
doing it, do I have
an ethical issue?

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.775 align:middle line:84%
Should I be using something
that has been shown to work?

00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:41.650 align:middle line:84%
It would be like saying,
well, I just kind of

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:44.142 align:middle line:84%
have an idea that I don't
want to use penicillin.

00:46:44.142 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are all these
other studies out there

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:84%
that show that you better
use it in certain infections.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And this was sort of my-- like
my confrontation with prayer.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Should I be using it?

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you came full
circle with this from the Bible

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.764 align:middle line:84%
Belt, the buckle,
to the agnostic--

00:47:01.764 --> 00:47:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --to now being the
advocate of bringing prayer

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:84%
back in and its effectiveness
from a scientific founding

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.360 align:middle line:84%
level into the
medical community.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.400 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're here.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have
these amazing--

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:17.930 align:middle line:90%
you've made such an impact.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.658 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, we don't
always know the twists

00:47:20.658 --> 00:47:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and turns in our careers, do we?

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But look back.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.320 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So, about the
remote viewing, how

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:31.540 align:middle line:84%
do they quantify that
that is absolutely valid?

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think
people have an ability

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:84%
to acquire information
from the world out there.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This is called remote
viewing in some circles.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that this gets to be
very interesting in medicine

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:49.270 align:middle line:84%
because people can know
things at a distance

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.780 align:middle line:90%
without any sensory assistance.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And here's where it actually
begins to get interesting.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:84%
People can know things
about their own body

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.310 align:middle line:84%
without any sort of mechanical
intervention at all.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.595 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example
about how this operates.

00:48:04.595 --> 00:48:07.430 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.040 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine had a
patient who came to him.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.180 align:middle line:90%
He was a family physician.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And this woman said,
I have breast cancer,

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's right here.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And she took an index finger
and pointed to a specific point

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
in her breast and said,
this is where my cancer is.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And so he did an exam.

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.600 align:middle line:90%
It was completely normal.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.560 align:middle line:84%
They even did a mammogram,
and it was totally normal.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I don't care.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I know it's here.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want-- I demand
a breast biopsy.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.688 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So she wouldn't
let him off the hook.

00:48:40.688 --> 00:48:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And so he phoned
up a friend of his

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:90%
who was a cancer breast surgeon.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, please
biopsy this woman's breast.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's
nothing to biopsy.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.305 align:middle line:90%
Where would I biopsy?

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.388 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And so the doctor
said, well, I don't know.

00:48:56.388 --> 00:48:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Just biopsy where she points.

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like a comedy,
but the doctor did the biopsy,

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and he, a couple
days later, phoned

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
the referring first doctor,
and he said, it's cancer.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the most microscopic
cancer I have seen in years.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.760 align:middle line:90%
How did you find it?

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.501 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have shown
up on a mammogram

00:49:18.501 --> 00:49:19.500 align:middle line:90%
or you couldn't feel it.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.190 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And this doctor, to his credit,
said, well, I didn't find it.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.260 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.662 align:middle line:90%
And she saw it in a dream.

00:49:28.662 --> 00:49:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So this is
where consciousness

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.820 align:middle line:84%
comes to be really important,
even in life and death

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
issues in medicine,
not just intentionality

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and distant healing, not
just in remote viewing,

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:84%
but the ability of
ourselves to use our minds

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:51.770 align:middle line:84%
in a way that has
been denied possible

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.687 align:middle line:84%
in the history of Western
scientific medicine.

00:49:53.687 --> 00:49:55.728 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, but if
somebody came in that says,

00:49:55.728 --> 00:49:58.125 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream, they would
think that person's crazy,

00:49:58.125 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that they're a hypochondriac,
that they're intentionally

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:84%
willing themselves to get
cancer to avoid an issue.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.858 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:50:03.858 --> 00:50:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
you have dived deep

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.460 align:middle line:84%
into this concept
of premonitions.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:84%
You wrote an entire
book about this,

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:84%
about how people use the power
premonitions to diagnose,

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to heal, to circumvent
events that have happened.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strong body
of work that you've

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.580 align:middle line:84%
once again
scientifically qualified.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I didn't do it
willingly, Lisa, I must say.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got into this
area kicking and screaming.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Again?

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Again.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did not go willingly.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:40.920 align:middle line:84%
But actually, like with
the prayer encounters,

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I had some encounters
with premonitions

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.580 align:middle line:90%
that I could not back away from.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:49.190 align:middle line:84%
The very first year I
was in medical practice

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.880 align:middle line:84%
in internal medicine, I had a
series of dream premonitions

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.450 align:middle line:90%
which absolutely shook me up.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the world was not
supposed to work like this.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:02.315 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a long time
to come to terms with that.

00:51:02.315 --> 00:51:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What were those?

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I dreamt that
the three-year-old son of one

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:14.510 align:middle line:84%
of my cardiology colleagues
was on an examining table.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
really weird dream.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I hardly knew this child.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
technician trying

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.760 align:middle line:90%
to do a test on his head.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And the mother was
standing at the bedside,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and this kid went crazy,
fighting the technician,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.090 align:middle line:90%
screaming, crying.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:36.742 align:middle line:84%
And finally the technician just
says, I quit, and walks away.

00:51:36.742 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And that was the dream.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, this
was-- I swear, at the time,

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.130 align:middle line:84%
this seemed like the most
vivid dream I've ever

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.410 align:middle line:84%
had in my life, none of
which made any sense.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So I get up the next morning,
I go make hospital rounds.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting with the
father, the cardiologist,

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of this young kid at
lunch when the wife walks

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:58.680 align:middle line:84%
in holding this baby, this
child, and his hair is wet

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and he's crying.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And she describes to
her husband my dream.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:84%
They had just come
from the EEG laboratory

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:09.270 align:middle line:84%
where they tried to
do a brainwave test.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:12.900 align:middle line:90%
The child just went berserk.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The mother could
not calm the child.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Finally the technician
just gave up.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So she describes what I
dreamed the night before.

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't know
what to do with this.

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was sort of an
existential mini crisis.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you say?

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, what I did--
she left with the little boy.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And I discussed this
with the father.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, could I
have known about what

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:38.470 align:middle line:84%
events were going
to play out today?

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, what?

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And so he-- I told him my dream,
and he became very anxious,

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.840 align:middle line:84%
agitated, refused to
talk about it ever.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So he was absolutely
threatened that this experience

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:58.160 align:middle line:90%
could occur.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I was uncomfortable, too.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, being two
physicians talking about it.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Right, so we knew
the world couldn't do this.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Things don't behave like this.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned that
I'm a great denier.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.100 align:middle line:90%
So I tried to deny this one.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that didn't
work very well.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because patients began
to describe to me

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.250 align:middle line:90%
their own premonitions.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unsolicited.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Unsolicited.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.085 align:middle line:84%
And then nurses
began to get wind

00:53:25.085 --> 00:53:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that Dossey's interested
in this stuff.

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So they began to share
their experiences with me.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:34.984 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing led
to another, and--

00:53:34.984 --> 00:53:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's how
you got into that book.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all combined, though.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically everything
that you talk about

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.650 align:middle line:90%
is about human consciousness.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It's about how
consciousness manifests

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:47.040 align:middle line:84%
in the world in
these strange ways

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
really nervous about.

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We haven't wanted to talk
about these things publicly.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.730 align:middle line:90%
But there's no going back.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't put this
genie back in the bottle

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:01.120 align:middle line:84%
for the overwhelming reason
of the scientific studies.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now we come to
this time and day in history

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:08.310 align:middle line:84%
where consciousness
is actually discovered

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.210 align:middle line:90%
to be valid scientifically.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:14.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole study about
this, about how consciousness

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.402 align:middle line:84%
is valid in the
scientific community.

00:54:16.402 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, actually
there are some enterprising,

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:22.900 align:middle line:84%
courageous academicians
in many fields,

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.270 align:middle line:84%
including mathematics and
cognitive science and physics,

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:28.500 align:middle line:84%
who are standing
up for what they're

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.460 align:middle line:84%
calling the fundamental
nature of consciousness.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a new ball game.

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Because 20 and 30
and 40 years ago,

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:40.810 align:middle line:84%
indeed during the 20th
century, the going idea

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:45.110 align:middle line:84%
is that the brain makes
consciousness in ways nobody

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.690 align:middle line:84%
understands, but consciousness
is just-- it just

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:52.350 align:middle line:84%
emanates from the brain
in some strange way.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Sort of like the
liver makes bile.

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The brain somehow
makes consciousness.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.014 align:middle line:90%
This has never been proved.

00:55:00.014 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's never been
directly observed.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.430 align:middle line:90%
There's no proof for it.

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.310 align:middle line:90%
But that's the going mythology.

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And so these studies
say otherwise.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They say that consciousness
can do things in the world

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.590 align:middle line:90%
that brains can't do.

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Brains stay put in the
cranium, in the skull.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness can acquire
information at a distance.

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
remote healing, it

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:84%
can insert information at
a distance into the world.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:29.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't explain this by
just equating consciousness

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.920 align:middle line:90%
with the brain.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Taking these leads,
many academicians

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.800 align:middle line:84%
from these various
fields now are

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.620 align:middle line:84%
saying that consciousness
is independent of the brain.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It may work through the brain.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:44.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no debate about that.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But you can't understand
how consciousness operates

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:51.220 align:middle line:84%
in our lives by just saying
it's a function of the neurons.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.360 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No longer.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.740 align:middle line:84%
There's so much not only
curiosity about this,

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.660 align:middle line:84%
the military's
using this in terms

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:04.130 align:middle line:84%
of a valid way of discovering
where certain people are.

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's very, very
well researched at this point.

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's used currently
in our society now.

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.237 align:middle line:84%
I think it's used
undercover in medicine, too.

00:56:15.237 --> 00:56:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it?

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.187 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I know skeptics
who just won't go there

00:56:19.187 --> 00:56:21.020 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what you
and I have been talking

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:24.450 align:middle line:84%
about who nonetheless,
in my opinion,

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:28.990 align:middle line:84%
use these extraordinary
ways of knowing

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:90%
without even thinking about it.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll just give you one example.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple of
professors in medical school

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:40.810 align:middle line:84%
who were able to make diagnoses
in ways they couldn't even

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:42.480 align:middle line:90%
explain.

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.750 align:middle line:84%
After they were able to
make a complex diagnosis,

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:47.430 align:middle line:84%
on one occasion, I went up
to one of them and I said,

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:49.610 align:middle line:84%
how did you get
from A to B to C?

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.500 align:middle line:90%
How did you make this diagnosis?

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And he had no explanation.

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:59.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, Larry,
it's just experience.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.489 align:middle line:90%
That was really helpful.

00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:02.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's no explanation.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So what I think a lot of these
really skilled diagnosticians

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:11.180 align:middle line:84%
do is to use ways of knowing
that are not rational,

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that you can't figure out in
terms of intellectual analysis.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And they just sort of
accept it as just part

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of their equipment.

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But they have been
scientifically quantified.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And there have
been studies on it.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So it does-- you
can validate it.

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, you can.

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
though, some people

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.640 align:middle line:84%
become so self-identified
with this totally material way

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.850 align:middle line:84%
of looking at things
that they don't

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:39.900 align:middle line:90%
want to look at the studies.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I have a perverse habit
of collecting comments

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:48.010 align:middle line:84%
from skeptics that
illustrate their refusal

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.570 align:middle line:90%
to look at the data.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.580 align:middle line:90%
My favorite one is this.

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.590 align:middle line:84%
One guy said, this
is the sort of thing

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:58.772 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't believe
even if it were true.

00:57:58.772 --> 00:57:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] That's good.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.610 align:middle line:84%
You told me a study
about nurses--

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a story
about nurses that

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:08.300 align:middle line:84%
went to go get a
therapeutic touch class.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:10.620 align:middle line:90%
My wife is a nurse.

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was involved in
this and told me this story.

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.000 align:middle line:84%
This happened at a
huge Dallas hospital.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Many nurses are very
open to these ways

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of knowing and distant
healing and so on.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the nurse community at
the hospital sort of banded

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:29.890 align:middle line:84%
together and went
off one weekend

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to take the course in
healing touch or Reiki.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember exactly
what the technique was.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.262 align:middle line:84%
But the director of
nursing was infuriated.

00:58:39.262 --> 00:58:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That they
took this course.

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: That they went
off and took the course

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:43.500 align:middle line:90%
in distant healing.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when the nurses came
back to work Monday morning,

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:49.640 align:middle line:84%
the director of nursing
had made this huge sign

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and posted in the nursing
department which said,

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:56.990 align:middle line:84%
"There will be no healing
in this hospital."

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:58.817 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, can you
imagine seeing that?

00:58:58.817 --> 00:59:00.400 align:middle line:84%
You walk in, there
will be no healing.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what the hospital does.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're there to
do is to heal, to get better.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:07.080 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: A related
instant illustrating

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.630 align:middle line:84%
the obstreperous nature
of some people in medicine

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:14.730 align:middle line:84%
toward this sort
of stuff, my wife,

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:18.630 align:middle line:84%
who is a pioneer in nursing
for this sort of thing,

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Barbara-- has written many
books about this-- was invited

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to give a lecture to a major
hospital in another city.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But when the people who
invited her discovered

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that she was going to
talk about healing,

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.500 align:middle line:84%
wrote her a
dis-invitation, saying,

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.010 align:middle line:90%
well, we've thought this over.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We think we can't
invite you just yet.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But we plan to re-invite you
when we get into healing.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So Barbara, my wife, said, I
wonder what they're into now.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, what is
it that they're doing?

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: What is
it that they're

00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.810 align:middle line:90%
doing now if not healing?

00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is the
bottom line of all of this?

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:03.510 align:middle line:84%
How can we use this
in our practical life?

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Well I think this
is highly practical.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
people knowing and doing

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
something about diseases,
incipient diseases,

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:16.790 align:middle line:84%
before they show up,
like the breast biopsy

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that the woman just
knew was there.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And also the remote
healing studies.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.491 align:middle line:90%
This is practical stuff.

01:00:24.491 --> 01:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
a point, however,

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
where this gets
beyond being just

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
another tool in our black
bag of medical opportunities.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has to do with
the nature of consciousness.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
What these studies
show us is that there

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
is some aspect of
who we are that

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.582 align:middle line:84%
can operate outside
the here and now.

01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We can operate, we
can insert information

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:52.160 align:middle line:90%
at a distance, remote healing.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We can know things
before they happen.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
These are the premonitions
that we've touched on.

01:00:56.970 --> 01:00:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some
aspect of consciousness

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that is just not confined
to the physical body.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I call this non-local
behaviors of consciousness.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I call it the non-local mind.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Non-local is a term that's
barred from physics,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
but it essentially
means infinitude.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
If something's non-local, it's
infinite in space and time.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, viewers can go
read about non-locality,

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
but what you will
determine in a heartbeat is

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that if something's non-local,
it's eternal and immortal.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's infinite in time.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:36.970 align:middle line:84%
If something's infinite in
time, it means it lasts forever.

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So what these studies
do is to point

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
like an arrow toward an
infinite, immortal, eternal

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.260 align:middle line:90%
aspect of consciousness.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a pretty
nice realization, frankly.

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It gets into--
where my mind is

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
going is if that is
true, then what can you

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:56.120 align:middle line:90%
create beyond that?

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
How can you, of course,
intentionally create healing

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, intentionally
create healing in others,

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
intentionally create
almost anything, as long

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.330 align:middle line:90%
as it's ecological?

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Can it be used for
the reverse effects?

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.235 align:middle line:84%
Can people create ill will
with this intentionality,

01:02:14.235 --> 01:02:17.071 align:middle line:90%
this consciousness?

01:02:17.071 --> 01:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well that's
a rational question.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a question that
always occurs to people.

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
If I can use my consciousness
in positive ways,

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
can I use it in negative
ways, for example

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.110 align:middle line:90%
to harm people and so on?

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: There are
no studies in humans

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to look at this possibility
of harming other people.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because those kind of
studies are illegal.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do a scientific study
whose end result is to harm.

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do is to test
this possibility on non-humans.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And people have been able to
work this both ways in animals

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and plants and
microbes and so on.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, there are
a series of studies

01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
show that people can perk up
the growth rates positively

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
in this group of bacteria
and not the control group.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And they can be given different
instructions, which say,

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
make them grow quicker.

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:15.701 align:middle line:84%
I want you to harm them,
make them grow slower

01:03:15.701 --> 01:03:16.450 align:middle line:90%
than the controls.

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.533 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The bad bacterias.

01:03:17.533 --> 01:03:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And so people can
operate this either way.

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
This clearly, it
seems to me, shows

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that people can cause
living organisms

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.760 align:middle line:90%
to flourish or to be harmed.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what the data show.

01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you wonder, why
do we have this ability

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.280 align:middle line:90%
to help and harm?

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there's a solid reason.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.247 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about when
people have an infection.

01:03:43.247 --> 01:03:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.621 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Let's say
pneumococcal pneumonia,

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
which kills tens of thousands
of elderly people every year.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
If you were praying
for your grandmother

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to get well from
penumococcal pneumonia,

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:58.147 align:middle line:84%
you would not be praying for
those bacteria to flourish.

01:03:58.147 --> 01:03:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right?

01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:00.236 align:middle line:90%
You would want to harm them.

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
You probably want
even to kill them.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.261 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I mean, that's
why we give antibiotics.

01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
We want to kill
those suckers, right?

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
certain situations

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
where it might come in really
handy to be able to harm

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
certain living things,
like pathogenic bacteria.

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
using your consciousness

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to harm cells, well if
somebody has cancer,

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:26.767 align:middle line:84%
you probably really want
to kill those cancer cells.

01:04:26.767 --> 01:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
So it may be--

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
the chemotherapy does.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's exactly right.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So there are
situations where you

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
can imagine it would
be a good thing

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to harm living
things, pathogenic bacteria,

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
cancer cells among them.

01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so this-- so
I mean, we're acting as if

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking as
if this really does

01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
work, this whole field
of, as it's been called,

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
quantum entanglement really,
absolutely does work.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well quantum
entanglement has emerged--

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the
most popular ideas

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
about how this
might be understood.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
observations about 30 years

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
ago in what are called quantum
physics experiments where you

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
take two particles that are
in contact, separate them,

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
even to the opposite
ends of the universe,

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and when you change one,
the other changes instantly

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and to the same degree.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
There's no contact.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.360 align:middle line:90%
It happens instantly.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no time for a signal
to go from one to the other.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So they behave as if
they are a single entity,

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:31.577 align:middle line:90%
even though they're apart.

01:05:31.577 --> 01:05:33.035 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I
remember-- the story

01:05:33.035 --> 01:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
you told me was
about somebody was

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.300 align:middle line:90%
watching images in a monitor.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.305 align:middle line:84%
And they were being
monitored in the next room.

01:05:40.305 --> 01:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me a little
bit about the neurons that

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.424 align:middle line:84%
were monitored as a
reaction of the images?

01:05:44.424 --> 01:05:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right.

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
What this study actually did
was to take human brain cells,

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
neurons, and grow them
in a cell culture dish.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have
here are brain cells,

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
brain tissue, over
here and over here.

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're put in
a lead-lined box

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
so that there's
no communication.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They're shielded
from each other.

01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
if you shine a laser

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
beam on one group of them,
they change, and instantly

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the other distant,
shielded neurons

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.740 align:middle line:90%
change to the same degree.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So somehow they're communicating
even though they can't.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
They're shielded from all
electromagnetic signals.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
They have no known connections
between each other.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
But they behave as if
they're still united.

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Now this is entanglement
at the cellular level.

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
photons or electrons.

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.992 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
human brain tissue.

01:06:46.992 --> 01:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the same thing was
done if the brain tissue was

01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:51.922 align:middle line:84%
put into another room,
another building.

01:06:51.922 --> 01:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Another state.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And here's where this
becomes really interesting.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You can take people
now, having demonstrated

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that brain tissue can be
connected at a distance,

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
and you can separate the people.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can hook them
both up to an EEG machine

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
or an fMRI, imaging
fancy piece of equipment.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can shine a light
in the eyes of one person,

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
making the EEG jump, and
instantly the other EEG

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
registers the same change,
even though there's

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
no connection between
these people at all.

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No communication
that you're

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
going to get a light
shined in-- nothing.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: No, no, no.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:32.486 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nothing.

01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And somehow
there's a connection.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
This defies everything we know
about conventional science.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:42.508 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: But you know what is
interesting about the people

01:07:42.508 --> 01:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
who do demonstrate the
changes at a distance

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
as if they're
connected, they usually

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
are very empathic
with each other.

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
They usually are people
who know each other

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and have a loving
heart connection.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And this has been worked
out in many studies that

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
look at the way the
connection may be mediated.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.350 align:middle line:84%
This really gets back
to the healing work,

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
because all of the healers
whom I have interviewed

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and whom I have asked,
how do you do this?

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:16.260 align:middle line:90%
What makes this work?

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
If you take it away,
and it won't work,

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.920 align:middle line:90%
what would that thing be?

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And they all say love.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.649 align:middle line:90%
They say caring.

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:26.790 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have empathy.

01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:29.521 align:middle line:84%
Some will use a term like,
well, you've just got to care.

01:08:29.521 --> 01:08:31.229 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to
feel it in your heart.

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But some
of these healers

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
don't even know the subjects
that they're healing.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
a relationship.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.038 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

01:08:36.038 --> 01:08:38.439 align:middle line:84%
But if they have a
relationship, the effect

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.094 align:middle line:84%
seems to be even
more pronounced.

01:08:40.094 --> 01:08:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even stronger.

01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:42.479 align:middle line:84%
Has it ever been
effective on people

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that don't have
the relationship?

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Oh, yes.

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
It has.

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:45.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It has?

01:08:45.415 --> 01:08:47.899 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Healing
has been demonstrated

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:51.859 align:middle line:84%
in these double-blind studies
when healers who don't even

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:55.560 align:middle line:90%
know the recipient are involved.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's effective?

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:57.859 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: It is.

01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, I think that
almost all of these studies

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
would be even more effective if
they use healers who actually

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
knew who they were praying for.

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:12.529 align:middle line:84%
You see, in real life, we
say something like, well,

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:14.464 align:middle line:84%
we pray for our
loved ones, right?

01:09:14.464 --> 01:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you hear people
say this all the time.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.359 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And there's a
lot of wisdom in that.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:20.729 align:middle line:90%
You love them.

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.819 align:middle line:84%
That means you know
them, almost always.

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:24.430 align:middle line:90%
You know who you're praying for.

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And also you pray
unconditionally for them.

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:29.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't hold out
prayer as a maybe.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I think I might pray for
you, but I'm not sure.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
double-blind experiment.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm only going
to pray a little bit.

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:35.335 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't want you
to heal completely.

01:09:35.335 --> 01:09:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgement in it.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.279 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: But you get
your heart into it.

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I think some
of the spontaneous healings

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that we see in real
life, where people pray

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:48.529 align:middle line:84%
for another person and
the disease goes away,

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where you see
the power of prayer jacked up

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
to a really high level.

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's enormous.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then we're going
to talk a little bit

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
about the studies on
spontaneous remissions.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking about
this in a practical sense

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and in a humanitarian sense.

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we pray for
people who are hungry,

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
when you pray for people
that are starving,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that are destitute, that prayer
in large numbers of people,

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:16.386 align:middle line:90%
really is effective.

01:10:16.386 --> 01:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
learning today.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.551 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, that's
what we're learning.

01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And we're not fooling ourselves.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
One thing that we get
out of these experiments

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is proof that when we
assume that my thoughts

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and my compassionate intentions
make a difference out there

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:34.370 align:middle line:84%
in the world,
that's not fantasy.

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate
value of these studies.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
They show that we're
not fooling ourselves

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about
the ability of people

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to positively influence
others at a distance.

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But why is there,
then, still starvation

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and child prostitution
and destitution?

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:52.440 align:middle line:90%


01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: If I were
able answer that,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd be
awarded a Nobel Prize.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.560 align:middle line:84%
These are the great things
that we struggle with.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
We can always say that if we
were not praying and intending

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a better situation
through prayers

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
or healing intentions
or whatever,

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.880 align:middle line:90%
that situations would be worse.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I know that's not a very
satisfactory answer.

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:15.836 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's one
of those questions that--

01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is not scientifically
quantifiable at this point.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I don't know
how to approach that.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:20.243 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But what we can approach is the
ideas of spontaneous remission

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and how this has worked.

01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, we mentioned there's
some studies on this,

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
on spontaneous remission
and how many cases

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:36.497 align:middle line:84%
it actually worked on and
how many it didn't work on.

01:11:36.497 --> 01:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: This is
an interesting area,

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
because most physicians
are taught, as I was,

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that spontaneous
remissions are really rare.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I was told that you'll probably
go through your entire career

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
without ever seeing
one of these things.

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think that's
just flat out wrong.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago, Carol
Hirshberg and Brenna Regan

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
did a literature search
from around the world

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
in many languages and dozens
of scientific journals

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and came up with
over 3,000 cases that

01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
have been published in the
medical literature where

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the disease just absolutely went
away, either with no therapy

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
or with such piddly
therapy that you couldn't

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
attribute the cure
to the therapy.

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this flies in
the face of the idea

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.429 align:middle line:84%
that these things
are really rare.

01:12:24.429 --> 01:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it also
said that they're

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:29.145 align:middle line:84%
done in different languages,
20 different languages.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Which means
that these things

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.540 align:middle line:90%
are seen all over the world.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And bear this in mind--
these things are not

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
usually reported, so
they're under-reported.

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Doctors don't want
to write them up.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:42.725 align:middle line:90%
They just ignore them.

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So they found
3,000 of these studies.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
How many more actually
happened, would we

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:52.545 align:middle line:84%
imagine, since they're
not usually reported?

01:12:52.545 --> 01:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that could
absolutely double.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a specific
study that was

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.556 align:middle line:90%
done about Rita Klaus, that one?

01:13:01.556 --> 01:13:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right.

01:13:02.230 --> 01:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rita Klaus is my
favorite example of one

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
of these spontaneous
healings that just happens.

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Her history is
absolutely fascinating.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
She was extremely
religious as a girl.

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And she received permission
to go into a convent

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
to become a nun earlier than
the rules ordinarily allowed.

01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:27.090 align:middle line:84%
But something
horrible happened soon

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:28.410 align:middle line:90%
after she went to the convent.

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:31.477 align:middle line:84%
She developed her first
symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

01:13:31.477 --> 01:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And this proved to
be one of the worst

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.220 align:middle line:84%
cases of multiple
sclerosis you can imagine.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:36.916 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: She couldn't walk.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%
She wound up in a wheelchair.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.210 align:middle line:84%
She could not attend to
her duties in the convent,

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
so she was given
dispensation from her vows

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.530 align:middle line:90%
and allowed to leave.

01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
She had to make a living, so she
went back and became a biology

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.680 align:middle line:90%
teacher in high school.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And she lost her faith.

01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
She became extremely furious,
in particular, at faith healers.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted nothing to do
with any of this spirituality

01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:08.660 align:middle line:90%
and healing business.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And there remained a little
interest in healing, however,

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
because she went to
Medjugorge, in Yugoslavia

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:19.810 align:middle line:84%
at the time, where a lot of
miracles have been reported.

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:20.980 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't get one.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
She came back with no effect,
positive benefit, at all.

01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And so she doesn't
know what to do.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And at her wits end,
she can't stand up

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.420 align:middle line:90%
without locked iron braces.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and her
doctors had predicted

01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that she-- this was such
a bad case it would soon

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
affect her mental
abilities and so on.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
So one night she has a dream.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, she sees the
Virgin Mary appear before her,

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and Mary says, Rita, why don't
you just ask for a healing?

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So in her dream, Rita
just asks for healing.

01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, she had
never done this before.

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:08.670 align:middle line:90%
So she wakes up.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The next day she's
teaching biology

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
in her wheelchair in
the high school class,

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and she looks down and
she sees her toes moving.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well,
it's just muscle spasm.

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I've had this before.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
her kneecaps, which

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
were on the outside of her knees
because the doctors had severed

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
the tendons to give her a little
more movement-- the kneecaps

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
have migrated back into
their normal position.

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:39.789 align:middle line:90%
This is essentially impossible.

01:15:39.789 --> 01:15:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:41.996 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So what's
going on here?

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I want
you to take me home.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Somebody drives her home,
helps her get her wheelchair

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.510 align:middle line:90%
into the living room.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So she's sitting
there, and she says,

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
this to the test.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
She says, if something
is really happening here,

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:00.965 align:middle line:84%
I can get out of this
wheelchair and run up

01:16:00.965 --> 01:16:04.093 align:middle line:84%
these 13 steps to
the second floor.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was more of a test.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: This is
idiotic, really.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: And she does.

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She did it?

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: She did.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.200 align:middle line:90%
She ran back down the stairs.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
She ran out the front
door of her house,

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
jumped over a little creek,
fell down and got muddy.

01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And she comes back
into the living room

01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and picks up the phone
and calls her priest.

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And this poor man is-- actually,
he's kind of horrified by this.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.970 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't seen this before.

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And says, Rita, lie
down, take an aspirin,

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.572 align:middle line:90%
and call your doctor.

01:16:41.572 --> 01:16:42.669 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So he didn't
want anything to do with--

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He didn't
believe it, either.

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:46.245 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: He didn't
believe any of this stuff.

01:16:46.245 --> 01:16:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So she calls her
best friend, who comes over.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They enjoyed a
good cry together.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So in a couple days, her
husband takes her back

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.870 align:middle line:90%
to the big hospital.

01:16:56.870 --> 01:17:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And she sees all of her
sub-specialists, the urologist,

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
the orthopedist, the
neurologists, and so on.

01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
don't believe it.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
One of her doctors accused her
of having an identical twin

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and playing a
practical joke on them.

01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Because it was that shocking.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.543 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes.

01:17:17.543 --> 01:17:18.530 align:middle line:90%
It was that shocking.

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But one of her doctors
did a neurological exam,

01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and it was normal.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.932 align:middle line:84%
Even the tendon
reflexes were normal.

01:17:26.932 --> 01:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
This should not
have been possible.

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the surgeons had
severed the tendons, right?

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:32.890 align:middle line:90%
But now they're normal.

01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, her
entire neurological examination

01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:37.896 align:middle line:90%
was normal.

01:17:37.896 --> 01:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is one of
the most extreme cases

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:40.561 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard of.

01:17:40.561 --> 01:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think
it takes the cake.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.891 align:middle line:84%
And I love this because
it's all written down.

01:17:44.891 --> 01:17:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's documented.

01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: A couple
of my friends who

01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book about this actually
went to look at her hospital

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
charts and the progress
notes and the whole thing.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is well recorded
and well documented.

01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:59.780 align:middle line:90%
But what do you do with that?

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.499 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not
possible from the standpoint

01:18:02.499 --> 01:18:03.540 align:middle line:90%
of conventional medicine.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it just
this one person?

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.744 align:middle line:84%
Right, can it just happen
to her and not to me?

01:18:06.744 --> 01:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's
statistics around this

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
as well that you've accumulated
about how many people believe

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
here that Marc Ian
Barasch did and Hirschberg

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
did as well about
spontaneous remissions

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.335 align:middle line:84%
and how many people
actually have

01:18:20.335 --> 01:18:22.902 align:middle line:84%
received-- have
experienced them.

01:18:22.902 --> 01:18:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
This the team--
Hirshberg was one

01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of the team that found those
3,000 studies worldwide.

01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And she and Marc Barasch
interviewed around 60 people

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
in the United States they
could get their-- get contact

01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
with who had actually
been written up

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:43.780 align:middle line:90%
in the medical literature.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.294 align:middle line:84%
So they went to
these people and did

01:18:45.294 --> 01:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
something that's never
been done before.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.410 align:middle line:90%
They said, why did you get well?

01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:50.930 align:middle line:84%
See, when these
cases are reported

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
in the medical literature,
you never get this.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
They never ask the person why
they thought they got well.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But they did it, and you can
see that the reasons that people

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.460 align:middle line:84%
give for getting well are
all over the ballpark.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:07.515 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like anything
has been attributed to work.

01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Look at that.

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
The highest percentage,
though, is positive belief,

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.174 align:middle line:90%
which I find very interesting.

01:19:12.174 --> 01:19:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And also prayer is right up
there close with 68% or 69%.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't see difference
that much in positive belief

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and prayer, but
apparently there is?

01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think
it's all blended together.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me, too.

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And I'm almost
certain the people

01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
who pray with the expectation
of getting better-- that's

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
positive belief if you ask me.

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a
certain way of praying?

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Is there a certain way
that you recommend to pray

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:48.282 align:middle line:84%
or that you have studied that
works better than other ways?

01:19:48.282 --> 01:19:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I've looked at
that pretty carefully.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And
people forever have

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
been looking for the
right way to pray, right?

01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.940 align:middle line:90%
What's the formula?

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:57.180 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: That's
what I want to do.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.760 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.190 align:middle line:90%
There isn't one.

01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
If you ask people
who are good at this,

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the really solid healers who
perform well in the studies,

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.330 align:middle line:90%
they're all over the ballpark.

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Some use "thee" and "thou,"
and some use vivid imagery.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Some try to get rid of imagery.

01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
As we've already mentioned, some
are religious, some are not.

01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I know even agnostics who
use healing intentions,

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want it
mixed up with religion.

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can
use visualization.

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%
You can use meditation.

01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Absolutely.

01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it has been done.

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
it has been done.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the strategies
that's been looked at.

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I must say that early on in
the history of these peer

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.480 align:middle line:84%
experiments, people tested
two ways of praying.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
One is where people pray for
something really specific,

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
make the cancer go away,
heal the heart attack,

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
versus people who used an
open-ended way of praying

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
in which they said, well,
may thy will be done,

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:05.390 align:middle line:84%
or may the best thing happen,
without spelling it out.

01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: There's
not much difference.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's no
difference, really.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: There's
hardly any difference.

01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
question becomes, well,

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
what's going on here
if the strategy doesn't

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.450 align:middle line:90%
happen to be of any consequence?

01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:24.149 align:middle line:90%
And it all boils down to love.

01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ask all
of those healers who

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.340 align:middle line:84%
use these different
strategies, what's

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.140 align:middle line:90%
the most important thing?

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.410 align:middle line:90%
They'll say you've got to care.

01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
You have got to feel it in
your heart, as we were saying,

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and there has to be a real
heart connection here.

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.994 align:middle line:90%
So love trumps religion.

01:21:41.994 --> 01:21:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It trumps science.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.384 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It trumps everything
where this is concerned.

01:21:47.384 --> 01:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've had the
amazing opportunity

01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to sit in this
chair and interview

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.585 align:middle line:84%
visionaries such
as yourself, and do

01:21:52.585 --> 01:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
you know how most of
those interviews end?

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.144 align:middle line:90%
The same way.

01:21:57.144 --> 01:21:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I love that.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The same way.

01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I love it
when that happens.

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:01.006 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Whether
or not I'm talking

01:22:01.006 --> 01:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
about near-death experiences,
ancient civilizations, healing,

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
biology-- it all
comes down to love.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely amazing.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:14.889 align:middle line:84%
We should put a reel
together of all the people

01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:16.180 align:middle line:90%
who said it comes down to love.

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.429 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, well, that
would be fascinating to do.

01:22:18.429 --> 01:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It would
because it's true.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And if you try
to tease apart, break up,

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:24.972 align:middle line:90%
what is this love business?

01:22:24.972 --> 01:22:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's implied?

01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:26.513 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:22:26.513 --> 01:22:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And I think it's
the breakdown of boundaries

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:30.900 align:middle line:90%
between people.

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We build walls between each
other, as rugged individuals.

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Our national ethos is built
on rugged individuality.

01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But love is the
opposite of that.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Love is a willingness
to break down

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:49.567 align:middle line:84%
the barrier of separation
between people.

01:22:49.567 --> 01:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this gives
me an opportunity

01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to make a shameless
advertisement for a book

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:55.122 align:middle line:90%
that I have finished.

01:22:55.122 --> 01:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, good.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:57.788 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It will be
published in a few months.

01:22:57.788 --> 01:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The One Mind,"
how our individual minds are

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:04.004 align:middle line:84%
part of a greater mind
and why it matters.

01:23:04.004 --> 01:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And the theme of the
book-- it goes back

01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
through history viewing all of
the spiritual and philosophical

01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:13.240 align:middle line:84%
traditions which say
that, at some level,

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
there is an enveloping,
universal mind

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.870 align:middle line:90%
of which our minds are a part.

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that
requires the breakdown

01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of boundaries that
separate you from all

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
the other consciousnesses
and the one

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.370 align:middle line:90%
mind of which we're a part.

01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And when people really do
this, healing power flourishes,

01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
love blossoms--

01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lives get easier.

01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Finances probably improve.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Often.

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think that love is
a very fascinating idea.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But we have to get through
the romantic notion of it,

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:51.840 align:middle line:90%
and the cultural versions.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It has the same
connotation that prayer has.

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It's got a certain
image around love.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, if you
think about it,

01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
has anyone at their
death bed ever said,

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I really wish I would
have hated somebody more.

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:03.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:04.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.830 align:middle line:84%
It's, I wish I would have
healed that relationship

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:08.040 align:middle line:90%
with my brother or mother.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I wish I would have let
go of that resentment.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd forgiven
myself for this, that,

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and the other that's all that
overarching theme of what

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:18.750 align:middle line:90%
the universal love is.

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's done from a
scientific perspective.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It's from a religious
perspective.

01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It's from a personal
development perspective.

01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Any way you look at it, it
all boils down to that theme.

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I've had a fascinating
experience researching this

01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
book on the one mind in terms
of looking at near-death

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
experiences where people after
death feel that they're united

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:40.940 align:middle line:90%
with--

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All of consciousness.

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: --all there is, right?

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's one thing.

01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:45.486 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
is they experience

01:24:45.486 --> 01:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
an overwhelming, ineffable
sense of overpowering love.

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And they almost all
come back saying,

01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I have never experienced
anything like this in my life.

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And this is transformative.

01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:02.420 align:middle line:84%
When they come back,
this changes their life.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it's
absolutely phenomenal.

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely phenomenal.

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So I want to end with
a prayer, if you can.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So if people are trying to
figure out how to do this,

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and if they want to
learn what it is, what

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is a way to do this
right now on this show?

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I want to refer
to my favorite prayer, which

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I offer to everybody as a
sort of an ecumenical prayer

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.480 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who is
interested in healing.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
This prayer is called
The Physician's Prayer,

01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was written by a fabulous
character, Moses Maimonides,

01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:45.910 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th century,
who was a rabbi.

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
He was the personal physician
to the king of Egypt.

01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:51.162 align:middle line:84%
And this prayer is often
used at graduation ceremonies

01:25:51.162 --> 01:25:52.370 align:middle line:90%
in medical schools and so on.

01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:55.280 align:middle line:90%
So here is--

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The prayer of-- OK.

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: --of Moses Maimonides.

01:25:58.810 --> 01:25:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How does it go?

01:25:59.810 --> 01:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: "You have
chosen me to watch over

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.490 align:middle line:84%
the life and health
of your creatures.

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to apply myself to
the duties of my profession.

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Almighty God, support
me in this great work

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that it may benefit my
fellow creatures because,

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:20.110 align:middle line:84%
without your help, even the
least thing will not succeed.

01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Permit not thirst for
profit or ambition

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:27.690 align:middle line:84%
for renown to interfere with
the duties of my profession.

01:26:27.690 --> 01:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
These enemies of
truth can lead astray

01:26:31.450 --> 01:26:34.890 align:middle line:84%
in the great task of
attending to the well-being

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:37.520 align:middle line:90%
of your creatures.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Preserve my physical
and spiritual strength

01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that I may cheerfully be of help
to rich and poor, good and bad,

01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:50.310 align:middle line:90%
friend and foe alike.

01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me see only the human
being in the sufferer."

01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That last sentence
right there is-- now

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I understand why it's
the physician's prayer.

01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:03.370 align:middle line:90%
You see the human being.

01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
You see the healing
ability in the patient.

01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:06.835 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah.

01:27:06.835 --> 01:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And it also implies
the breakdown

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
of boundaries separating
a patient from a doctor,

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
all the hierarchy's done away
with, love comes to the fore,

01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:17.392 align:middle line:90%
and caring predominates.

01:27:17.392 --> 01:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's amazing,
because then it's

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
a co-creation in the
healing experience

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.130 align:middle line:84%
rather than, I will heal you,
you will then heal yourself.

01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a co-healing
that happens.

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: We used to know
this, and we forgot it.

01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the origin
of the word diagnosis,

01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
we usually say, that's something
the doctor does, right?

01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:38.670 align:middle line:90%
He makes a diagnosis.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:42.880 align:middle line:84%
But dia- gnosis, the
original meaning of the word,

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.476 align:middle line:84%
is a knowing that occurs
between two people.

01:27:47.476 --> 01:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
what it means,

01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
a knowing that occurs
between two people.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.798 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

01:27:51.798 --> 01:27:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and to relinquish
your healing to another person

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.430 align:middle line:90%
is never a good idea.

01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's about self-healing
ultimately,

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.920 align:middle line:84%
because you're the ultimate
one who heals yourself

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
with the guidance of
medicine or prayer

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and showing how effective it is.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.597 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you cannot do
this, knowing what you know.

01:28:13.597 --> 01:28:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I feel that way.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.221 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:28:15.221 --> 01:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Knowing
what we know, it

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
would be like refusing
an appendectomy

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%
if you have appendicitis.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.290 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense
to refuse something

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
that's that strong and powerful.

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That could
save your life.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And there's-- yes, absolutely.

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:35.980 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed this.

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I've enjoyed learning
about more and more

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
of your stories and
your life and so forth.

01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed that.

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward
to your next book

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
as well, because that
sounds really good, too.

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It's going
to be really good.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sure it is.

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I enjoyed it.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.506 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so, Lisa.

01:28:48.506 --> 01:28:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.
