00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and we are broadcasting from
the Sounds True Wake Up festival

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
in the beautiful Rockies
surrounding Estes Park.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.251 align:middle line:90%
So what is creativity?

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Is it something
that you do when you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:84%
have extra time on
your hands, or is it

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
something that maybe
you learned to do

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:90%
in preschool and kindergarten?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Or can it be used by
Fortune 500 companies

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to solve problems that they have
when they get a failed business

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:90%
move or an industry dive?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
Michael Gelb, yes,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that's what creativity
is used for.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
He's the world's
leading authority

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on the application of genius
thinking and creativity.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of many books
on how to use creativity,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
including "How to Think Like
Leonardo da Vinci," which

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:90%
is a very creative title.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And his latest,
"Creativity On Demand,"

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.835 align:middle line:84%
which is how to ignite and
sustain that fire of genius.

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:04.335 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL GELB:
Thank you so much.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.644 align:middle line:84%

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:08.413 align:middle line:90%

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:08.913 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: Yes.

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:09.788 align:middle line:90%

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: This is our official

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Ignite and Sustain the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
It's on the cover the book.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It looks like a
superhero type of thing.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: It is.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:90%

00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:27.133 align:middle line:84%
So it's just your--
it's your logo

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.258 align:middle line:90%
on the front of your shirt.

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:30.045 align:middle line:84%
On the back is the
actual book cover.

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: That's right.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And my wife actually
handcrafted these t-shirts.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
She used a color printer, made
these, and ironed them on.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: So we could
launch the book here

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:90%
at the Wake Up Festival.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very clever.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Very creative, very creative.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
I have to ask you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
about your book about how to
think like Leonardo da Vinci.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
You have a fascination
with him, don't you?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Well, Leonardo was
one of my childhood heroes,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:90%
along with Superman.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.781 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: Yeah, sure.

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Because kids love superpowers.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
When you're a kid, you're little
and there's all these grownups,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
do-- you're supposed

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.965 align:middle line:84%
to do what you're told,
although I rarely ever did.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.243 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, uh-huh.

00:02:11.243 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: And so you
dream about having

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
powers that will free
you from the constraints

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of your limited
authority as a child.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think
comic books are so popular.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Kids fantasize
about superheroes.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's about being
independent thinkers, too,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:90%
about thinking--

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Well, that's
the great thing.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
As I got older-- when I was a
kid, I heard about Leonardo.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother was an
Italian painter, an artist.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And she met my grandfather
because he ran a dress business

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Lower East
Side of New York.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very
savvy businessman.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, even
though I'm making dresses

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
for women working
at home, they still

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
want a little touch of
beauty even if they're

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
working in the
kitchen or ironing.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, so who are
the best designers?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.326 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Artists.

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: Italians.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, Italians.

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: An Italian
artist, of course.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So my grandmother had just
come back from art school.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:90%
So my grandfather hired her.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And we joke in our
family that if they

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
had today's human
resource policies in terms

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
of sexual harassment back
then, we would not exist.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a good thing.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.895 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: But fortunately--

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It turned out fine.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.386 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Yes, it turned
out really great.

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So we grew up with this
wonderful synthesis

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:90%
of these cultures.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother taught
me about Leonardo da Vinci.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And as I grew older, I
realized that Superman was only

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.585 align:middle line:90%
a comic book character.

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:39.195 align:middle line:90%
But Leonardo was real.

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: And he seemed,
to me, to embody

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:90%
all of our human potential.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:84%
He, to me, is the
supreme archetype

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:90%
of our creative gifts.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So I thought why not explore
in more detail what he wrote,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
what he taught about accessing
our own creative power.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
People ask me, did
you channel this?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: I don't know why people
think something is necessarily

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
more potent because it
came from somebody dead.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you went and
walked in his footsteps.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.756 align:middle line:84%
You had to have soaked
up some of that energy.

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: Oh, I did big time.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I did big time.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's in the book is
really practical advice

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo actually
gave to his students.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you read his notebooks,
he tells his students

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.309 align:middle line:90%
how to be more creative.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you did that.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:90%
You read his notebooks.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.064 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Well, I read them
all, over and over again.

00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you took out these--

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: And I
abstracted the things

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that could be translated
into contemporary terms

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
to be helpful to
all of us today--

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to anybody who wants to live a
richer, more fulfilling life.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Or to my corporate clients, who
want a more creative culture.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:90%
They need to be more innovative.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:90%
They need to solve problems.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
They need to be able

in a much more efficient,
effective and powerful way.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
So this is my life quest.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.742 align:middle line:84%
I've used Leonardo-- or he's

His father was in the Guild of

It's another
unfinished painting.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But what you see in the

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:90%
holding the Christ child.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And she's surrounded by all
this chaos and all this tension

and all this attachment to
worldly things and change

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.635 align:middle line:90%
and difficulty.

00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And there-- even though
it's an unfinished painting,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
you can see-- and she's--
her figure looks more spiral,

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.807 align:middle line:84%
because Leonardo was one of the
pioneers of the technical they

00:17:18.807 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
call contrapposto, where
they know it tends to be more

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
interesting to the eye if you

this.

through her and this
tremendous serenity again.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:90%
I do keynotes all the time.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I did an 18-minute program.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:90%
is the mind mapping technique.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have a picture here
of what it looks like.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is how you came up
with the seven principles,

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.765 align:middle line:90%
is through mind mapping?

00:30:34.765 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Well, mind
mapping is a method

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from the
gentleman who originated it,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:90%
my dear friend Tony Buzan.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Way back in 1975, I was training
as a teacher of the Alexander

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Technique, and Tony was taking
Alexander Technique lessons

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:90%
from my teacher.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So he came to speak
at our school,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and he presented mind mapping
and speed reading and memory.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
this guy has got

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:84%
a big, important piece
of the puzzle here.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
director at the school.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.879 align:middle line:90%
I said, I gotta learn this.

00:31:12.879 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, it's
funny you say that,

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:84%
because Tony said to me, who
was that American guy who's

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:90%
asking all those questions?

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
We need to connect.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.205 align:middle line:90%
So we started collaborating.

00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I taught him how to juggle.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Eventually, I gave
him Alexander lessons.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I was his martial arts
sensei for a while.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me mind mapping,
speed reading, memory,

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.470 align:middle line:84%
then invited me to be on
this corporate seminar--

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
a five-day seminar in
Vevey, Switzerland.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, the head
of HR of that company said,

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.070 align:middle line:84%
we want this American
guy on all our seminars.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm travelling all over
the world teaching people,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.330 align:middle line:90%
senior executives.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I knew nothing about
business way back then.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But they liked what I
was sharing with them.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And meantime, right
at the same time,

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
my master's thesis.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was stuck because I
learned, like most people,

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.270 align:middle line:90%
to write by making an outline.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to think of
roman numeral number one,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and I was just looking at
this blank page going, uh-oh.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So when Tony taught
me mind mapping,

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
he said, forget about
the top-down structure.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, start in the
center, draw image

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:84%
to inspire your imagination,
and then let your mind go free.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Just follow the discipline
of printing in keywords

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:84%
so you could read what your
ideas are later more easily.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And then draw
illustrations and doodles.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.159 align:middle line:84%
And even though I
thought I couldn't draw--

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It didn't matter.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.241 align:middle line:90%

I'm telling you about my very
first breakthrough with mind

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
mapping, because that's
how I became an author.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I then-- once I put

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:84%
put flip chart paper on the
walls of my flat in London.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And I just filled it.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a mess.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.127 align:middle line:84%
It was chaotic, all over
the place, pure association.

00:33:09.127 --> 00:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But I said, oh my god, I
know much more about this

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:90%
than I thought I did.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Then I stepped back
and I said, OK,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
what are the most
important ideas here?

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was absolutely obvious.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I highlighted them in yellow
phosphorescent highlighter.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Then I asked, what
order should they go in?

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:90%
And that was really clear.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it out longhand.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.060 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine typed it up.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
We sent it into
my thesis adviser.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I got my master's
degree, my thesis adviser said,

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a student's

So then for each book,
I made a mind map.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, for-- So
what you see here and all

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:90%
the others--

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They all had mind maps.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: They all
started with a mind map.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I do mind

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The one that you're
seeing here on the screen

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:30.344 align:middle line:84%
is the mind map of
the da Vinci book?

00:34:30.344 --> 00:34:31.969 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: When I give

Leonardo da Vinci, I

want to give them a very--
I've just taught them the seven

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:84%
principles, just
like we discussed.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.598 align:middle line:84%
So then I show them
this, and I say,

00:34:41.598 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:90%
what's the image in the center?

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.301 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh, the parachute.

00:34:44.301 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Because Leonardo invented it.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The parachute.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Yes, he
invented the parachute

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.464 align:middle line:90%
before anyone could fly.

00:34:50.464 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did not know that.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: Yeah.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the figure
underneath the parachute

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:84%
is Leonardo's
Vitruvian Man, which

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:84%
represents your unlimited
human potential.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a classic symbol
of the Renaissance.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Then you see we have a
branch-- branching out--

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:10.545 align:middle line:84%
just an organic way, like brain
cells branch out, neurons--

00:35:10.545 --> 00:35:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Neurons, yes.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Branch through
dendrites and axons

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:90%
to connect with other neurons.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- This is a
natural, organic structure.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So you see curiosita
with the question mark.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Keep a notebook.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Dimonstrazione, the
three views of a flower

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.315 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo-- he tells

00:35:30.315 --> 00:35:31.315 align:middle line:90%

Leonardo's a

00:36:07.524 --> 00:36:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: And then connessione,
you see the infinity symbol.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It represents the

the infinite creativity that

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:90%

right there in a
very small space.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I asked-- so then I
asked the group, I say,

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.847 align:middle line:84%
so if you-- I asked
them to copy this down.

00:36:27.847 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I say, I know you have a camera.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:90%
You can take a picture of it.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll leave you my
slides, but you copy it,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:84%
because you need to draw this
yourself to activate you brain.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And once they draw
it, I say, now,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:84%
could you use this to give a
presentation to your children,

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
or your spouse,
or your colleagues

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.555 align:middle line:84%
who weren't here about
the seven principles?

00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:90%
They say, yeah, I could.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask them,
I say, could this

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.730 align:middle line:84%
have been my notes
for this talk?

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.105 align:middle line:84%
And they say, they
probably were.

00:36:53.105 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I say, could it
have been the notes

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:90%
from which I wrote the book?

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they were.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Now my original mind map on da
Vinci was not this organized.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't in
clockwise rotation.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
messages I introduce

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:84%
in "How to Think Like
Leonardo," and then

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I go into much more depth
in "Creativity On Demand"

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.370 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great
secrets of creativity

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
is-- the biggest block to it
is people-- my clients suffer

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:84%
from what I call
"premature organization."

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: They try to put things

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:84%

Ask what order it should go in.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:84%

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:20.114 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.114 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: I went to the place

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
place where he died.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I literally
walked his footsteps

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and aimed to look at the
world from his point of view.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I read his notebooks
over and over again.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I read the scholarly
works about him.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I started dreaming about
him, and from those dreams,

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:90%
seven principles emerged.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:05.565 align:middle line:90%


00:39:05.565 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:90%
I learned how to juggle.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I
saw someone doing it

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was
incredibly beautiful.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.994 align:middle line:84%
Looked to me like
moving sculpture.

00:39:13.994 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So I went up to
this great juggler

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and I asked him to teach me.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out
he was not as good

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.250 align:middle line:90%
a teacher as he was a juggler.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you know
what he told me?

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.708 align:middle line:84%
He said, take these three
balls, throw them up,

00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:25.579 align:middle line:90%
don't let any of them drop.

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:27.120 align:middle line:84%
You ever get an
instruction like that

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
in the course of your career?

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tried really
hard and the balls

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.874 align:middle line:84%
were dropping over
and over again.

00:39:32.874 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I would have given up, but
I really wanted to learn.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I had an
enlightenment experience.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I realized that if I could
discover curiosita, be

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.770 align:middle line:84%
more like a child, more
playful, it'd be much easier.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Dimonstrazione was clear.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to figure
it out for myself.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Sensazione.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel the
rhythm, enjoy the color.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Sfumato.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
learning anything

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.710 align:middle line:90%
was a journey into the unknown.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Arte/scienza and corporalita
were all about balance.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I had the
enlightenment-- connessione.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything connects
to everything else.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
If you meditate on this
pattern, what is it?

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Infinity.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
It represents your
infinite potential.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The art critic Bernard Berenson
said of Leonardo da Vinci

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.912 align:middle line:84%
that everything he touched
turned to eternal beauty.

00:40:25.912 --> 00:40:27.870 align:middle line:84%
My wish for you is you'll
take these principles

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and bring a touch of that beauty
to your life every single day.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Grazie mille.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.877 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't-- I
tried music lessons and I

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:90%
wasn't particularly gifted.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I'd taken art lessons.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.825 align:middle line:90%
I learned laboriously.

00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I actually collected mud
from the bottom of a river

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and learned how to throw
it into a pot, which

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:84%
was quite beautiful in
the end, but it took me

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.390 align:middle line:90%
a really long time.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.690 align:middle line:90%
So I just, you know.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And other people were going--

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So I was struggling for what is
my form of artistic expression.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:84%
When I saw somebody juggle,
I said, that-- that's it.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I got to do that.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good example.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I could see someone
juggle and say that-- and not

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:90%
say that that's mine.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.672 align:middle line:84%

you resonate with.

00:42:01.672 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: Anyway, I saw that and
I said, I got to learn that.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So I went to this great juggler
and I ask him to teach me.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:84%

he was not as good

Because you know
what he told me?

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, take these three
balls, throw them up,

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:90%
don't let any of them drop.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:90%

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.570 align:middle line:90%
And I had this "aha" insight.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I realized that instead of
trying to catch the balls,

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:90%

00:43:02.232 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It helped that I was studying

>>GELB: I said, yes, so
let's focus on alignment

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:84%

let's take the task

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:84%

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.780 align:middle line:84%

00:43:22.035 --> 00:43:22.875 align:middle line:90%

00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I figured out,
if I didn't even

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.760 align:middle line:84%
try to catch them--
I let them drop--

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I could get the
throw more perfect.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I threw three

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, before

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:90%
were just landing in my hands.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And this great

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:41.690 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be almost
going around by themselves.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.395 align:middle line:84%

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, if you
want to keep the process going,

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.840 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep
tossing the ball, which

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.400 align:middle line:90%
means it'll probably drop again.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the
lessons is, if you want

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to keep learning
at a higher level,

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep letting go
and being willing to embrace

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.677 align:middle line:84%
the chaos that
comes with-- think

00:46:45.677 --> 00:46:47.760 align:middle line:84%
about what happens when
we try four balls or five?

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.971 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Really?

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: So when I

I teach presentation skills

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're comfortable
speaking to a small team of 20.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.710 align:middle line:84%
How about your first
speech for 200 people?

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:05.432 align:middle line:84%
How about the first
time you do 2000 people.

00:47:05.432 --> 00:47:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And how about when you're
on live television in front

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of millions of people?

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to access--
These principles just

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:84%
become more import-- the
fundamental principles become

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.489 align:middle line:84%
that much more important as

00:47:19.489 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure
you can teach people

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.450 align:middle line:84%
when someone drops the ball,
you got to pick it up for them

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.950 align:middle line:90%
and run.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:24.820 align:middle line:90%

You learn to support

And what's great is,
I get people then

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to give each other feedback
on what's going on.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And even people who don't
yet know how to juggle

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:47.590 align:middle line:84%
can help others juggle, mostly
just by their supportive

When you give

you help create a field
that makes learning easier

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.586 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: All right.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's mastering-- there's
five mastering principles

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about in
"Creativity On Demand."

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we could break
those down a little bit

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to help someone-- anyone who's
going to a creative process,

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.910 align:middle line:84%
are these the five steps
that they would start with?

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GELB: This contextualizes
the whole creative process.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
This is in part three of
"Creativity On Demand" called

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Mastering the Creative Process.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.640 align:middle line:90%
The book has three parts.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.430 align:middle line:84%
There's Mastering
Creative Energy,

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:90%
which is the first part.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:84%
There's Mastering
the Creative Mindset,

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.300 align:middle line:90%
which is the second part.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's Mastering
the Creative Process.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.105 align:middle line:84%
So what we're learning to
do is put them all together.

00:48:44.105 --> 00:48:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Energy,
mindset, process.

>>GELB: Yeah.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:51.482 align:middle line:84%
So this is the third one,
Mastering the Creative Process.

00:48:51.482 --> 00:48:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And to master the
creative process,

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.115 align:middle line:84%
you need to know
these five phases.

00:48:55.115 --> 00:48:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GELB: The Preparation phase.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I might joke about this is when
I was growing up in New Jersey,

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.605 align:middle line:84%
would-be hoodlums in my

and say, you got a problem?

00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:10.300 align:middle line:84%

00:49:12.777 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:90%
What's your problem?

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.570 align:middle line:90%

Can you imagine how

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.591 align:middle line:84%

OK, what are we real--
what's really going on here?

00:49:41.364 --> 00:49:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it takes you six
months, or sometimes years

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:44.300 align:middle line:90%

Has anybody solved this before?

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Are there underlying issues
we haven't considered?
