00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam "Inspirations."

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
This story of how one
woman can make a difference

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:84%
is inspirational and
also really shows

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:84%
how you could live-- truly
live-- a life of purpose.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Akuyoe Graham is joining me.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:84%
She has committed herself to
teaching incarcerated youth who

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
feel unheard and
unworthy to have

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.667 align:middle line:90%
a life of purpose and dignity.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And she had done this
through her foundation

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:90%
called Spirit Awakening.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, through one
child at a time, Akuyoe

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
teaches these children
creative writing, meditation,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
using the spoken word
to express and help

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
build character, and
ultimately build self-esteem.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.486 align:middle line:90%
You have an amazing program.

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AKUYOE GRAHAM:
Oh, Lisa, thank you

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:84%
very much for having
me on your show.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.605 align:middle line:90%
I love you, Lisa, so--

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
The love is mutual.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I really
just honor you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and the work you
do in the world.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned so much from
listening to you on the radio.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%
You have a beautiful voice.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And just, your presence
really speaks so loud.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's inspired me.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
To know that what we talk
about here has inspired you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.215 align:middle line:84%
and these children makes it
just so beautifully worth it.

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Many times, I take you to the
juvenile facilities with me.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:84%
You're there in
my heart or I hear

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:90%
something that inspires me.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it'll just inspire
an entire topic or lesson plan

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and I go with it.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
That is beautiful.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So how did you get
started in all of this?

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, take me way
back-- way back.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.626 align:middle line:90%
You grew up in--

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: OK.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I was born in
Ghana, West Africa.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in both
England-- London-- and then

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:90%
New York and then Los Angeles.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I first moved to Los
Angeles-- I'm a trained actor.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I love acting.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I love writing.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I moved here and I was
working pretty well.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I was making
commercials, TV films.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
So I've done some things.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- this is
a true story-- one day,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
coming home after a shoot
on a made for TV film.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't a licensed
spiritual practitioner

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
at the time, but I
just got on my knees

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
in my home-- in my
apartment in Hollywood.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.922 align:middle line:90%
And I said, God, so is this it?

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to become
famous and make money?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.661 align:middle line:84%
You've got to give
me a little bit more.

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: They say be
careful what you ask for.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think what I
was really saying

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:90%
was that I needed to go deeper.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.907 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's great.

00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:90%
We're in award season right now.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of amazing films.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can see--
certainly, growing up,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
it was films that I
saw that inspired me.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So there was a reason
why I wanted to do that--

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and plays that inspired me.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know that not
all of them do that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted something
that would really

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:84%
allow me to use all of me--
all of my talents and gifts--

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
unabridged, unfettered,
where I wouldn't

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:90%
have to be small in any way.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And so once I
uttered that prayer,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
almost immediately, I
was offered a position

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
with L.A. Theater Works to
go to the juvenile system.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, I began
writing my one woman play.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So everything just started
happening all at once.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching poetry to
incarcerated juveniles that

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
were in the special handling
unit, which means that these

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
were children that had committed
pretty serious crimes that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
would be going away
for a very long time.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd never done that
kind of work before.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I did not know that
I could even do it.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
But I remember going in for
the job interview, Lisa,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and I sat up-- and then I
didn't have a computer, even.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I took pen to paper.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And something just came through.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading
it thinking, holy Moses,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:90%
can I teach this?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I was quoting things from
scripture, from Shakespeare--

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a really--

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just really
coming through you.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: It really
came through.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's when
you know it's divine--

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you don't
have a reference for it.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now when you said
you moved from Ghana to London,

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
what was the reason
for the move,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%
or what did your parents do?

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: My parents
were divorced.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, who is
one of my biggest heroes,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see the world.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me--
she wanted to make sure

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:90%
that I saw the world.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to make sure that
I knew that the world belong

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to me-- that no matter what--
she said she wanted to make

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
sure that she could teach
me that yes, I'm a woman;

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.355 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'm a woman of color
and I'm from Africa.

00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:40.894 align:middle line:84%
She said, all that
just does not matter.

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about that, Lisa,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
is that she could teach me
that even though she was going

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
through her own struggles in
terms of finding her voice

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:90%
and being who she is.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet she was
very clear that that

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.289 align:middle line:90%
was what she had to teach me.

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she was
going through that

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and teaching you
how what she needed

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.484 align:middle line:90%
to learn at the same time?

00:04:59.484 --> 00:05:00.441 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:90%
At the same time.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.686 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I mean, you went--
and you explain in this clip

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to watch here--
of it not being comfortable

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%
for you--

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.525 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of going to
London from Africa.

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: At the
time, my mother-- here

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
she is, a divorcee-- a
single woman-- with me

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and we're from Africa.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And back then, we hadn't evolved
as much as we all have now,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the human race.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And so England was a very
difficult transition for me.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I cannot lie about that.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
It was just the level of
discrimination and prejudice

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
and for so many reasons.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember that I
saw things in black and white.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:90%
The snow was white.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It was cold.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we wearing
coats and jackets

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And everything seemed to just
point to me going inward.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt like
I was shrinking.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%
So that was my experience.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came
to the United States,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I began to
open myself back up again.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.416 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at this clip here.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
This is Akuyoe doing an amazing
reenactment of her one woman

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
-Well, the same thing happened
to me when I got in a plane.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
When it was my turn to
join my mother England,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I was sent on a plane.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
On the ground, I
was amongst millions

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.974 align:middle line:90%
who looked just like me.

00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But as the plane rose
higher and higher,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.955 align:middle line:84%
I got smaller and
smaller, just like what

00:06:35.955 --> 00:06:39.322 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen looking up from the
earth, so that by the time

00:06:39.322 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I landed at Heathrow
Airport, I'd

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
shrunk so small that I'd
become a mere spec of pepper

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.535 align:middle line:90%
in a sea of salt.

[SINGING] Lavender's
blue, dilly, dilly.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Lavender's green.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.375 align:middle line:84%
When I am king, dilly,
dilly, you'll be my queen.

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
In school, no one sang that
song to me because I was African

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't see
that I was a princess

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.242 align:middle line:90%
and could one day be queen.

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] In Ghana,
I wasn't colored.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.392 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was the same as me.

00:07:29.392 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that was unusual

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.812 align:middle line:84%
was if someone
was without color.

00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
In this new world, living
space was boxed and sold

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
into little compartments
called flats.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
No more cooking under the stars.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The sun and the moon were now
strangers to us, locked out

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
by keys, and bars, and
doors, and windows.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Earth and her daughter trees
leafed in places called parks;

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
animals barricaded in zoos;
human beings in apartments;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:90%
everybody in their place.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Visitation at
certain hours only,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and don't dare visit
someone without first

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%

No more skipping
barefoot on Mother Earth.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:28.056 align:middle line:84%
Shoes and boots were necessary
for the march, march on cement.

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:28.555 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:28.555 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.749 align:middle line:84%
No, mama, please don't make
me go out there to play.

00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They look at me funny and
they make fun of my name.

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
Akuyoe, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they call me Charlotte
and they call me a golliwog.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.079 align:middle line:90%
They say golliwog to me.

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:54.037 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a golliwog am I, mama?

[CRYING]

00:08:55.516 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Ah, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
my darling, don't cry.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
If they call you
something, then you

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.324 align:middle line:84%
have to call them
something back.

00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to be strong.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Properly, look at me.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm number one at Pitman's
Secretarial School, eh?

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Pah, pah, who loves you, eh?

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Mama loves you.
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [SINGING]

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
At home, with mama, we could
speak in our real voices.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.916 align:middle line:84%
In London's gray, miserable
world, no one could hear me.

00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But finally, I had
to go out there.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I had to go to school.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.014 align:middle line:84%
And all the books I read were
full of these colorless people.

00:09:54.014 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] I remember walking
through the snow school

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and clinging to the
railings because I

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
was terrified of
falling on the ice.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:15.047 align:middle line:84%
I arrived at the school
and was met by Miss Coat.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have incredible
talent as an actress.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
do, to have all

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of that going on in your mind.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
That one moment
where you look up

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and you say mama--
that was beautiful.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Were you trained as an actor?

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.649 align:middle line:84%
I've had some of the
best acting teachers.

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, I
trained with a gentleman

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
named Sanford Meisner--
Herbert Berghof, Uta Hagen.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.264 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah, these
are some of the greats.

00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You were trained
by these people?

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I was
trained by them, Lisa.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.745 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
So I do not take it for granted.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%
They trained me well.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was in
the company of masters.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I loved was
that all of them,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
especially Sandy-- we called him
Sandy-- he would always drive

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
home to us-- he said, look,
it takes at least 27 years

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:90%
to become a really great actor.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
So he said, live your life.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Don't not live your life.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, work if
there's work for you to do.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But just know that with
acting, as you live

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have these
rich experiences,

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're going
to bring to your roles

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:90%
and to your characters.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So the unfortunate
thing about Hollywood

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
is that it tells
us the opposite.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.525 align:middle line:84%
As we age or mature,
whether you're

00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:26.377 align:middle line:84%
a woman or man-- whatever--
it tells us well,

00:11:26.377 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:90%
the roles are going to diminish.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.084 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's like,
wait a minute,

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:90%
but this is the good stuff.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm hitting my stride.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.316 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
This is where the juice is.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a little bit
about the Meisner method

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
about bouncing and
impulses, right?

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.795 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And answering
and listening.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.178 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:11:43.178 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And being improvisational
so that it doesn't become

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
stuck and old, but
each moment is fresh

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
because you keep it
improvisational by listening

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.842 align:middle line:84%
and then responding
in the moment.

00:11:53.842 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had a teacher
tell you that this wasn't it--

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.212 align:middle line:90%
this wasn't all there was.

00:11:58.212 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.731 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then when you
got to the place of, OK,

00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I have a certain amount of
jobs, working as an actor--

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.547 align:middle line:90%
but you knew there was more?

00:12:05.547 --> 00:12:06.505 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:12:06.505 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
I knew there was more.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.766 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was
more in me to give.

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what it was.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to make sure that
when I'd run out of my time

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
here, now, that I had
given all my gifts.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be finished
with this run-- this race--

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
this particular incarnation--
and not have given

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.305 align:middle line:84%
the gifts that
are in me to give.

00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was very
important to me.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I may not I have been able
to articulate it in that way.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet there was a
urging inside of me

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
that I had to listen to, that
said, hey, wait a minute.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You're capable of more than
this and you better get to it.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you found the
incarcerated youth program

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:90%
through one of the--

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: L.A.
Theater Works, yes.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.066 align:middle line:84%
And then I began working
with them that way.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:47.565 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Poetry, first.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Poetry was my inroads to them.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:90%
So it was poetry.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It was Shakespeare.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:90%
It was literature.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I love language.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.642 align:middle line:90%
I love performance and writing.

00:12:57.642 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How was that
received in the beginning?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did
you bridge the gap?

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Well, I
think when I go in,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
what I like to do is
give them an invitation.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm in a classroom
with some children-- and they

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:90%
are children.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.879 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to remember
that sometimes,

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
especially if you look
at their rap sheets.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I never look at the rap sheets.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them that, look,
you have judges and lawyers

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else that's taking
care of that part of your life.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to take care of
the other part of your life.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's look to that
place within you

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that is greater than
your circumstances--

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:90%
greater than your situation.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:90%
That is within you.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:90%
It's in all of us.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to that.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.243 align:middle line:84%
And so they know
immediately that that's

00:13:41.243 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:90%
what I'm concerned with.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not someone who's
coming to judge them.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be authentic.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The first level
of the program is

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:84%
called "Unmasking
Your Authentic Voice."

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I have a series of
contemplative questions

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that I ask them to contemplate
and then to respond.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So I choose my
language very carefully

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
because I want them to really be
inspired by the language that's

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:90%
chosen in our time together.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I started--
I have to tell you,

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.475 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, the children
responded immediately.

00:14:16.475 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
If they hadn't, I wouldn't
still be doing it,

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's too hard.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Because some of them
are really angry.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of them-- they
don't have manners, some.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And so you walk in and they
give you the finger or whatever.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.455 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, if this isn't
going to work-- it's too hard;

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
it's too difficult-- why
would I want to do it?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But immediately, from day one,
it was like a love affair.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You commanded that
presence and you

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.582 align:middle line:84%
were unwavering with
who you were being.

00:14:45.582 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you go
through these programs,

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned that
many of these children

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:90%
are in for a life sentence.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And that starts in
their preteen years,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:90%
which I don't understand.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
How do you incarcerate a child
at nine years old, for life?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, Lisa,
it's horrific.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, I had two girls
at the Los Padrinos Juvenile

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Hall here in
southern California.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.557 align:middle line:90%
That's in Downey.

00:15:14.557 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
the special handling

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
unit for the
girls-- girl's shoe.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And two of my girls were
going away for a long time.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I met them at the
age of 14-- 13, 14.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:90%
They were incarcerated.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.629 align:middle line:84%
And so I was with them
throughout their whole trials.

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though I didn't
go to trial with them,

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I would go meet them in
the classroom the next day

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So I've known these girls
for four years or so.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And watching them get taken
away into adult system,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.495 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's really--
it's heartbreaking.

00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was going to
ask you, what happens?

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.881 align:middle line:84%
Because things change
from week to week.

00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah, it does.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I just can't
even go into the room

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.597 align:middle line:84%
when I know this
is their last day

00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:55.805 align:middle line:90%
or tomorrow's their last day.

00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just say,
you know what?

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Can we say so long now?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going to be
hard for me, as well, to say

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
goodbye to you because I
know what's coming to you.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you have that
time and that moment with them

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.684 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:16:11.684 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Talk about
living in the moment?

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Right?

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I say to them--
because sometimes, especially

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.403 align:middle line:84%
with the boys-- even some of
the girls will challenge me

00:16:18.403 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, why
should I do this work?

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Miss Akuyoe, I'm going
away for 30 years.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:90%
So what the hell?

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.736 align:middle line:90%
Can I say that?

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:27.276 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: What is this
program going to do for me?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say to
them well, I just

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
know that you have
nothing to lose.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:90%
So I'm inviting you to try it.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm inviting you to
keep an open mind.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm inviting you
to have the courage

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.414 align:middle line:84%
to go on this journey
of self-discovery

00:16:44.414 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can't discover
more about yourself than you

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:47.802 align:middle line:90%
think you know.

00:16:47.802 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to
put aside all that you

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.580 align:middle line:84%
think you know about
yourself and really

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
just allow yourself
to be an open page

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what
else is there?

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We know what you think you
know up to this moment,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
but let's see what
else is there.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.510 align:middle line:90%
What can you discover?

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
What's strengths are
in you that will then

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
help you navigate your way
through this next 30 years

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
or how many ever years
you may be incarcerated.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you approach
it that way, again,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:90%
what do you have to lose?

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it doesn't
have to be a life

00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:19.239 align:middle line:84%
sentence-- an end
of life sentence?

00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is your life now.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So make
the best of this.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And in
turn, these programs

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:90%
could be what they live for.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Exactly.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I have kids
writing to me saying,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
give me some more
writing problems.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Give me something
to contemplate.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I need some more-- I want to
keep working on my inner life.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So send me books and
ask me questions.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing
because this is what

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:49.401 align:middle line:84%
will keep them alive
while they're there.

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.733 align:middle line:84%
You go through the
creative writing process.

00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:53.747 align:middle line:84%
How do you start
with that process?

00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: With that
process-- in fact today,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
just before coming here, I was
teaching at the girls camp.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
There's two girls facilities in
Santa Clarita just for girls.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.425 align:middle line:84%
So my day one is
all about the who

00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:84%
am I-- what I call
the Who Am I exercise.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.794 align:middle line:84%
We start with a few
moments of meditation.

00:18:11.794 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
very, very start

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:84%
of the program,
what I put to them

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:90%
is, what if this were a country?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
We have the opportunity
to create a country--

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
a different country
right now this classroom.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
What should be our guidelines?

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, what qualities do
you need to feel safe enough

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to be successful in
your life-- to transcend

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and overcome and transform
some of your difficulties?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll share with them
that what I need is respect.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, when I come in, I need
you to really bring respect

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:90%
into this classroom.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, since
that's what I require,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to show up with it.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I will respect each and
every single one of you.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:84%
When you speak, I'm willing
to listen-- not just shut up

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:84%
so you can finish talking,
but really listen to you.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.726 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go around the room and
everyone will give a quality.

00:19:00.726 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we create
a contract that they

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
have to sign so that
whenever we're together,

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
the commitment is
that we're going

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to create a safe environment
where we can each really

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:90%
be our very best.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Because what I've
discovered, Lisa,

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is that success is also
a matter of safety.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
successful, you stand out.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:90%
You are seen.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:90%
You're visible.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So you have to feel safe
enough to be visible

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be strong enough
to know that in your success,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if people
like you or they don't like you.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:90%
It'll happen.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.126 align:middle line:90%
So it's a matter of safety.

00:19:36.126 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And for these
children, they have

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
to feel safe enough to know
that they can articulate

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.434 align:middle line:84%
their intelligence and wisdom
without being made fun of.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
brilliant idea, though.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great
teaching technique to say,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.121 align:middle line:90%
this is your own country.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:90%
You make the rules.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:90%
You're safe.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:90%
You make the safety of it.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And they even call it-- so
every time they come in,

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.601 align:middle line:84%
you've created an
environment of safety.

00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Exactly.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And we read the
contract every time

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
we get together, to
remind them, hey,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.349 align:middle line:84%
this is the commitment
we all made.

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What types of
things are on the contract?

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: So we have respect.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
We have open mindedness,
trustworthiness, fun, laughter,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
integrity.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We have honesty,
and that they're

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:84%
willing to live authentically--
the time we spend together--

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and that they will
try their very best

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to show not
only respect for themselves,

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
but for each other,
and that we're

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
going to create a country
that's full of dignity,

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
where everyone has the
opportunity to really embrace

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
a sense of self-worth
and self-respect

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and a certain level
of elegance, as well.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice And dignity.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.411 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Dignity, yeah.

00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And so that's day one?

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's day one.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you don't
even start the writing?

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No, not yet.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Actually, day two, then we begin
the writing, with the Who Am I.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're asked to contemplate
the question, who am I

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
underneath my name,
underneath my age,

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:90%
underneath the color of my skin?

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And what is my purpose
for being alive?

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm asking them to get
beyond the facts of their lives

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
as they know it-- to even
get beyond the thoughts they

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:90%
have about themselves.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes the thoughts
we have about ourselves

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:90%
are not true.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And they live by their facts.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.255 align:middle line:84%
It's on every single
sheet, paper-- everything.

00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:20.005 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Exactly.

00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
throw that all away.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you start to see?

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, man, this is
one of my favorite exercises,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, because sometimes
a child will write,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I am a young woman
of self worth.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I am more than my pain.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I am more than my circumstances.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I am so much more
than what you see.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you give
me a chance, I'll

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:90%
show you, as I show myself.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:90%
And the writings are phenomenal.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.439 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you then publish
some of these in a book.

00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:52.521 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: We publish some
of these writings, yeah.

00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which makes
them feel so great.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you tell them upfront
that this is what happens?

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Sometimes,
depending on the environment.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.346 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I'll
say-- because I

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:05.219 align:middle line:84%
don't want the book
to be the hook.

00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they'll
say, well, what

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:90%
do I get if I do this work?

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, you
get yourself back.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't get a cookie or-- no.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:90%
You get yourself.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that enough?

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we will bring
in treats, but the point

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
is, I want them to begin to know
that who they are is enough.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got a
great job, that is enough.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
icing on the cake.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But who you are and
that sense of having

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:84%
accomplished something or
finding your authentic voice--

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.065 align:middle line:84%
my goodness, that
is more than enough.

00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And then later, I'll
tell them, listen,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.023 align:middle line:90%
I want to publish some of these.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:90%
So we have release forms.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
If they're 18, they can
sign, or family members

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:84%
or legal guardians
can sign for them.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we publish
the books, each child

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
will get a copy
of the book, which

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm really, really proud of.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they can have that
legacy living out in the world,

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:90%
permanently?

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Today, Lisa, was so funny.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
This one young girl didn't
realize that the book "An Angel

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.876 align:middle line:84%
By My Side--" that
my foundation had

00:23:00.876 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:90%
compiled it and put it together.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
She said, this exercise, it
kind of reminds me of that book.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading a great book
called "An Angel By My Side."

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.113 align:middle line:90%
She went on and on and on.

00:23:09.113 --> 00:23:11.762 align:middle line:90%
She goes, it's a great book.

00:23:11.762 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:90%
It's really helping me.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.816 align:middle line:84%
Page 67-- she remembered
the page and everything.

00:23:15.816 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, yeah,
I'm familiar with that.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.515 align:middle line:84%
I edited the book and it's
from students of mine.

00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:90%
She goes, you did it?

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful synchronicity.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the book
is called "Voices

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.009 align:middle line:84%
of the Unheard," which
is a beautiful title.

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Isn't that wonderful?

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you do
volume after volume?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: We do.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
We also have events that we do
called Voices of the Unheard

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
where we have some of the
young people that are now

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
out interpret their own work
as monologues-- soliloquies--

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
alongside professional
actors and dignitaries.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So Lisa, you may get
a call from me going,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
are you available to come
be one of the readers?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.024 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I would be honored.

00:23:54.024 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Because Reverend
Michael and his wife Ricki--

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are you kidding?

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: It's a lot of fun.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What a privilege.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: It really is.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And for me, too, to
facilitate all of this.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: And it's incredible.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let me ask you
about the acting part of it

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:90%
and the expression part of it.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you teach kids who
have never, ever thought

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
about being an actor or
performing anything on stage?

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Well, I just
tell them, just be honest.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Be honest with your feelings.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK if you cry.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I remember last summer,
I worked with one girl

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:84%
who's very resistant
because she's not

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
used to allowing herself to be
vulnerable in front of people.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And she'd written this beautiful
piece about her grandmother.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my God, it's one of the most
stunning pieces I've ever read.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if it's OK,
Alejandra, just do it.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And she would fight me
and throw temper tantrums.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But on the day of the
event at the school,

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
she started to
read her monologue

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and then it broke through
and her voice cracked.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was not a
dry eye in the audience

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
because she really spoke
from her heart, dedicated

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
this piece-- this
beautifully written piece--

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%
to her grandmother.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And it was awesome.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:07.775 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:25:07.775 --> 00:25:10.337 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And she got
to express that.

00:25:10.337 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Her grandmother
wasn't there, was she?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.586 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: No, she
wasn't, unfortunately.

00:25:13.586 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But she got to
express it for her

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.507 align:middle line:90%
and to feel what that's like.

00:25:17.507 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's a good
point because you don't need

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:90%
to be attached to the outcome--

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --in any of this.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.338 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:25:24.338 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's
best if you're not,

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
because I think for so
many of these children,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
they've been let down
so much by expectations.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And so just do it.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And just let the moment unfold.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Let it--

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is such
a great life lesson,

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.432 align:middle line:90%
is to detach from that outcome.

00:25:42.432 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have so
many expectations

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.252 align:middle line:84%
put on us and our visions of
how perfect we want it to be.

00:25:49.252 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and how
we think it should be.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I was just telling one of
your associates, Joyce,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
that even being on your show--
she had no idea that I just

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
love you and how much
I wanted to meet you.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:90%
She had no idea.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So I said, wow, Joyce, if
we just keep doing our work

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.396 align:middle line:84%
and let the magic of life
put the threads together--

00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It shows
up as a miracle.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: It shows
up as a miracle.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But yet it's
already been pre-designed.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.297 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:26:15.297 --> 00:26:15.954 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:15.954 --> 00:26:16.579 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:17.355 align:middle line:90%
I just love that.

00:26:17.355 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Isn't that cool?

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.324 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We think
we're in charge.

00:26:20.324 --> 00:26:21.545 align:middle line:90%
I forget that all the time.

00:26:21.545 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Me, too.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've recently
gotten better at just

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
when I can't figure things
out and things change

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and I don't get it, I just
keep giving it up and giving

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.297 align:middle line:84%
in and going, OK,
this is your plan.

00:26:31.297 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Guide me to the next step.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Guide me to the next step.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's been mapped out.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I tend to sometimes think
I'm in control and I'm not.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I'm not in
control, at all, of anything.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.129 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the children
that you talk to,

00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that's got to be one
of the biggest things,

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is that they feel
out of control.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.268 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: They sure do.

00:26:50.268 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:90%
They feel out of control.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:90%
They're in a lot of pain.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for them to
trust because the adults

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:84%
or the people around them
that they've have to trust,

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:90%
most of them have let them down.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're having to learn--
and they've let themselves down.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the point that I
try to address is I said look,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:11.955 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you down you.

00:27:11.955 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll expect me to
come in maybe one day,

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and she's off doing
something and I'm not here.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of
the human life.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:84%
However, even when you
let yourself down, how do

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:90%
we recover from those things?

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference--
how you recover.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So we need to build
skills and build

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
new ways of behaving
that can help us better

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
recover-- that can help us
discern how to make better

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:84%
choices to take advantage
of opportunities

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.504 align:middle line:90%
when they come to us.

00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we talked
about today, in fact-- I said,

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
look, ladies, some of
you wait to like someone

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.340 align:middle line:90%
before you do something.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm standing here.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:90%
You may or may not like me.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Is anything I'm saying
resonating with you

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:90%
in your heart, where it matters?

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:90%
If it is, then so be it.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, I get it.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.766 align:middle line:84%
No one program is going
to be fine for everybody.

00:28:05.766 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
billions of us

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's billions
of programs.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:12.340 align:middle line:90%
However, be true to yourself.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they have to learn--

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:90%
how to listen to themselves.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Have you learned a ton?

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, yes, Lisa.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I've been
teaching-- just as my mother

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.092 align:middle line:84%
was learning what she
was trying to teach me,

00:28:29.092 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I, too-- that seems to
be the fabric running

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:90%
throughout our family.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching what
I need to learn--

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:90%
how to have the authentic voice.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Because people will
say to me, well,

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:84%
how can you relate
to these kids?

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
You're not involved with drugs
or addictions or anything.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, my
addiction of choice

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:90%
was a sense of unworthiness.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, that was crippling
for me on certain levels.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:84%
You could never tell
by looking at me

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:84%
because I could
put on a nice smile

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and I could be respectful, but
inside, I was in a lot of pain.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And so as the children
become stronger, so do I.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:84%
As I'm teaching them to have
a greater sense of self-worth,

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.605 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching myself--

00:29:10.605 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So will you.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.953 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: So will I.

00:29:11.953 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're turning
that worthlessness

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
into worthiness
through your journey--

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.485 align:middle line:90%
through fulfilling your purpose.

00:29:20.485 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is the
whole point that I really

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
wanted to convey
here, was that you

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.386 align:middle line:84%
can discover your own healing
through helping others.

00:29:30.386 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's one
of the biggest--

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.572 align:middle line:84%
it's the best way
of self-healing.

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:35.655 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: I think so, too.

00:29:35.655 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember Oprah
said that one of the best

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
ways to self-healing
is to help others.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.682 align:middle line:84%
So these children, I'm
so indebted to them.

00:29:47.682 --> 00:29:49.699 align:middle line:90%
I just love them.

00:29:49.699 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's because you say
that that it's successful.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look here
at a clip of the entire program

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Spirit Awakening.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.572 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:02.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:84%
-Spirit Awakening is a program
founded by Akuyoe Graham that

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
is designed to awaken the
spirit of young people

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.267 align:middle line:84%
in the juvenile camps and
at-risk youth, in general.

00:30:15.267 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:84%
-Right now, she's working
in our girls programs.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And she takes these very angry,
depressed acting out kids

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and she gives them hope.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
-I was fighting 25 years
to life without parole.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had just been slowly
going through this process,

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
writing every day and getting
to know myself on the inside.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.936 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.936 --> 00:30:48.676 align:middle line:90%
The accused, misused, misled.

00:30:48.676 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm the mistake, black
sheep, disappointment.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I am redemption,
determination, a second chance.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.267 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to do right.

00:30:57.267 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Stand free from my
plight and I refuse

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:90%
to give up without a fight.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:90%
I am redeemed.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
-So that foundation was
created as a nonprofit--

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
a charitable arts
organization-- that

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
would implement creative
writing and life skills

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:90%
programs to youth-- teenagers.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
-I could be free and
still be incarcerated.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So that, in itself, is what
Spirit Awakening means to me.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's freedom within the bars.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.030 align:middle line:90%
-The work is so important.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
You have children who
haven't felt like they're

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
worth very much put
in a place where

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:90%
they're made to feel even worse.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And Spirit Awakening comes
in and we show them love.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We show them love
through who they are.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
-She approaches everything
via spirituality.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's key
because Miss Akuyoe shows

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.090 align:middle line:90%
them a different side of life.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
-There has to be an avenue.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a way for youth
to engage in a conversation,

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.480 align:middle line:84%
even, about spirituality
and who they are.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:84%
That has to be offered
to them because if that's

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:84%
who we are and we negate
that, then essentially,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:90%
we're negating ourselves.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to
a classroom-- you

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:20.900 align:middle line:84%
go to an educational facility
to teach, especially,

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
youth that are disenfranchised--
youth that have been neglected

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and abandoned or
abused-- but you're not

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:84%
going in with the very heart
and soul of who they are

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and who you are, how far
are you really going to get?

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.279 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:38.612 align:middle line:84%
-It's a writing program-- a
WRITES of passage-- W-R-I-T-

00:32:38.612 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
E-S-- because it helps to evoke
who they are from the inside

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.060 align:middle line:84%
out through language--
through words.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:84%
-They see their work
published in books

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and they see their
name under it.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:90%
They get credit for it.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:90%
They're featured in a book.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
wow, that's my work

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that Miss Akuyoe
inspired me to write.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
-It begins to
dispel all the myths

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:90%
about so-called bad children.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
it's our responsibility

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to develop an environment
where children

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
are free of pain
and fear and anger.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
program begins to do.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It begins to touch on
that-- to free them

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts that
keep them enslaved.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:84%
-I'd just like to look
into the camera and say,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.770 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't yet taken a stand
for the children of the world--

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't yet taken a
stand and supported Spirit

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Awakening-- the foundation--
this is your opportunity.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It'll make you feel
good about you.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:84%
-So anyone who sees or is
touched by this program,

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I urge them to take
a stand with her

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and contribute in
whatever way they

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.270 align:middle line:84%
can so that these
programs can go forward

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and that lives can transform.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.857 align:middle line:90%
-We're saying, be still.

00:33:59.857 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is such a
great analogy for life,

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:84%
is to take all the
thoughts and the feelings

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and the unworthiness that
we feel about ourselves--

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and these children have
learned to lay all that aside

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.489 align:middle line:90%
because this is their life now.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.615 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have
children who just buck you

00:34:19.615 --> 00:34:21.489 align:middle line:84%
and say, there's no way
I'm going to do this?

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, sure.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
deal with that?

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.968 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Well, I had to learn
how not to take it personal,

00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ahh,
they don't like me.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been a big
learning curve for me, as well.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:84%
And now, though, again, what
I do ask of those-- if there's

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:84%
one or two that do not
want to participate--

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:84%
I have learned that some
of the kids may say,

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to participate,
but they're listening.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:84%
They are still in the classroom
and they are listening.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, those
kids, six months later,

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.380 align:middle line:90%
they're now my best friend.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.889 align:middle line:90%
And they've done the writings.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.097 align:middle line:90%
They've kept it in a journal.

00:34:57.097 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, Miss Akuyoe,
I did all the writings.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I know I never participated,
but here it is.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And still, you do have
some that will say,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:90%
no I don't want to do this.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.529 align:middle line:90%
This is not for me.

00:35:06.529 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, fine.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're
not disruptive,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.230 align:middle line:84%
you can do other work that
your teacher will give you,

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:90%
and we're good.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you win
some; you lose some.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But most of them
really do participate.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
part of a curriculum?

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I am, which
is really amazing,

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.290 align:middle line:84%
because I get to teach this
with a teacher in the classroom.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not an after
school program.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a part of
it's been sanctioned

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.326 align:middle line:84%
by LACO-- the Los Angeles
County Office of Education.

00:35:34.326 --> 00:35:35.700 align:middle line:84%
That this is one
of the ways they

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.520 align:middle line:84%
can enhance the classroom
learning, through the Spirit

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Awakening program, as well.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really big
honor end kudos to LACO

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.059 align:middle line:84%
for recognizing that the arts
can be really instrumental.

00:35:47.059 --> 00:35:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huge.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.974 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah,
it's really huge.

00:35:48.974 --> 00:35:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It's been taken out
of school systems that

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.642 align:middle line:90%
are outside of the program.

00:35:53.642 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: I know.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's wonderful.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So within the
educational day, it's

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:84%
regular math and
science and arts

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.584 align:middle line:84%
are a part of the curriculum
every day, or once a week or--

00:36:05.584 --> 00:36:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Once a week.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I go in once a week.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
a twice a week.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A different place?

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:10.735 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The program is at the girls
camp in Santa Clarita,

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:84%
also at Los Padrinos Juvenile
Hall in Downey, and then

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Sylmar Juvenile Hall,
which is in Sylmar.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And we've been working at
the Phoenix Academy, as well.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So different places--
different schools.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:29.282 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just for
incarcerated children.

00:36:29.282 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:84%
As one teacher once
said to me, you

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.160 align:middle line:84%
don't have to be incarcerated
to have a spiritual awakening.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:33.951 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I know.

00:36:33.951 --> 00:36:34.769 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Well let me ask you,
how could people--

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.970 align:middle line:84%
if they want to be a
part of this program

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.297 align:middle line:84%
and they're in a different
part of the country--

00:36:42.297 --> 00:36:44.380 align:middle line:84%
have you developed a program
where they could step

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:84%
into a curriculum and do
this in their own area?

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
They can contact us through
the foundation website.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have a book-- "The
Little Book Of Transformation--"

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:84%
which is the first
level of the program.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So they could order
some of those books.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I also do go out to
different places.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I really am doing
now that I'm excited about

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:84%
is I'm able to teach and
do professional development

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
with teachers or artist
teachers and help them develop

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:14.129 align:middle line:84%
a program for their site
or in their community.

00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's brilliant.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.275 align:middle line:84%
So you've made this
bigger than you.

00:37:17.275 --> 00:37:19.275 align:middle line:84%
It's not just have to you
going to these places.

00:37:19.275 --> 00:37:19.983 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No, no.

00:37:19.983 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
many learnings here.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have made this
available for other people

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:84%
to go in and teach at
their organizations.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Facilities, yeah.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But they can
take on this curriculum.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you guide them through it
or is there a online situation?

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: The online,
we're working on.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
We want to have that up
by the end of the year

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
so people can just go online
and do this program online.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so
anywhere in the world,

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:84%
somebody can take this program
on, bringing arts and writing

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.162 align:middle line:90%
and transformation--

00:37:49.162 --> 00:37:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's not any
specific religion that you're--

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No, not at all.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You could still practice
your own religion.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:84%
The meditation is simply
taking moments of silence.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Who cannot benefit from a
few moments of being still?

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mindfulness.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Mindfulness.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you teach that?

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the first
thing you go out with?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:84%
What's really nice is that
through the contracts that we

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.520 align:middle line:84%
create with the students--
they create these guidelines

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:84%
for this new country
that we're creating.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:84%
After they've signed it and
we have one of the students

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.730 align:middle line:84%
get up and read it, then we
take our moments of silence.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We go into the silence
where we make a commitment.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's mindfulness.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's a guided
sort of meditation

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
where I'll invite them, again,
OK, just bring all of yourself

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:90%
to this moment.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is
happening in the dorm

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:84%
or with whomever--
whatever-- be here now.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.141 align:middle line:84%
Let's be present
to this moment now.

00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Then we take the
moments of silence.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Then we begin our work.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.234 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And does that
always start off that way?

00:38:54.234 --> 00:38:54.775 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: No.

00:38:54.775 --> 00:38:56.275 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if I go
into a classroom--

00:38:56.275 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
there's something
going on-- I have

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to deal with
whatever is going on.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
There might be a
fight breaks out

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.605 align:middle line:84%
or something happened in
the dorm-- in a classroom.

00:39:05.605 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And when the kids
are hot with anger,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.898 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to say, OK, let's be
quiet and go to the silence.

00:39:09.898 --> 00:39:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Again, being
mindful-- I have to be mindful.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes we might end
the classroom with the silence

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.520 align:middle line:84%
or we might do it in
the middle of the class.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.176 align:middle line:84%
But what I have
found is sometimes

00:39:20.176 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
the students will say,
if we haven't done it,

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
can we take the
moments of silence?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:90%
I really love it.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.949 align:middle line:90%
I like being quiet.

00:39:26.949 --> 00:39:28.407 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
opportunity they

00:39:28.407 --> 00:39:29.533 align:middle line:90%
get to do that and be safe.

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: That's right.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And be safe.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.667 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, some of the
children have gotten out?

00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.209 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've
befriended these children?

00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, yeah.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole mentoring
program, as well.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Because Lisa, it takes
an awful lot of money

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:90%
to incarcerate someone.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:48.036 align:middle line:84%
The figures change,
but I estimate,

00:39:48.036 --> 00:39:49.660 align:middle line:84%
from the Department
of Justice, that it

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:84%
takes anywhere between
$30,000 to $70,000 per child.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: And so if
we are willing to make

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that kind of
investment, we better

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
be willing to make an
investment when they come out.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Because a lot
of times what happens

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.306 align:middle line:84%
is that when they come out--
when they're released--

00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:06.550 align:middle line:84%
they go right back into
the same environment.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that environment
is an abusive environment--

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:84%
so all that work we
just did, and you're

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.610 align:middle line:90%
putting them right back there?

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many 16, 17 year olds--
it's hard enough for an adult--

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:90%
breaking habitual patterns.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you're 16
and 17 and then you're

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.160 align:middle line:84%
placed back in an environment
where perhaps that is not

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.070 align:middle line:84%
supported or your family
members and the people

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.210 align:middle line:84%
you're living with now
view you as a threat

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.247 align:middle line:84%
because you've changed--
you're not gossiping.

00:40:31.247 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:32.930 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: There you go.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.004 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:40:35.004 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
You think you're better
than us-- all of that stuff.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And you're 17.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.220 align:middle line:84%
You just want some
peace of mind.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like, fine.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll do whatever.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
rearrested because you

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:84%
broke your probation
and you're back again.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my board
and I said, look,

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to open group homes.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to call
them Spirit House.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my God.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.270 align:middle line:90%
That is immense.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Isn't that--

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I mean,
Lisa, can you imagine?

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You listen and you do.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:90%
You just do.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.091 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:41:03.091 --> 00:41:03.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about them.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Well, thank you for
encouraging me with your show.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So I really do listen.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So Spirit House-- I'm
so stoked about this.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I envision a home-- maybe
six beds or so for the kids

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.319 align:middle line:84%
with two adults living there
full time like house moms.

00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:24.735 align:middle line:84%
We'll have Spirit
House for girls,

00:41:24.735 --> 00:41:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Spirit House for boys, where
they can-- there's a meditation

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.920 align:middle line:84%
room-- a room for silence--
where they can continue

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
these practices that
they're learning.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:84%
They can go to school and then
come back and stay for at least

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.820 align:middle line:84%
two years-- a minimum of
one year up to two years.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So that by then, they
really have these new skills

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.350 align:middle line:84%
under their belt
and they can go out

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:84%
in the world feeling
a little stronger.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
They are more secure about who
they are-- about their voices.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.540 align:middle line:84%
They can go out in
the world and begin

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.000 align:middle line:84%
to face the world
that they are in

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and live these contributing
lives of purpose

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.920 align:middle line:90%
and intentionalities.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the vision.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of where
we're at right now.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's just starting now?

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.618 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: That's
just starting now.

00:42:06.618 --> 00:42:07.720 align:middle line:90%
We're in that process.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that by
the end of this year,

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.350 align:middle line:84%
we can announce at our year end
event, hey, we've Spirit House.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:90%
We got the house.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.038 align:middle line:90%
We're going to open it.

00:42:15.038 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my God.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So you do events
every year for--

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: We do--
Voices of the Unheard.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Every December, we do
Voices of the Unheard.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.586 align:middle line:84%
And last year, just this past
December, we did it at USC

00:42:28.586 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and we're hoping
to go back there

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:84%
again this year for
our 20th anniversary.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And before then,
though, in March,

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
the LA County Adolescence
Social Services

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.750 align:middle line:90%
has asked us to do an encore.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:46.696 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing it March 20th at
LATC-- Voices of the Unheard.

00:42:46.696 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Isn't that great?

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've been doing
this for 20 years now?

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.005 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:42:50.005 --> 00:42:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.102 align:middle line:84%
You speak of it as
if you just started.

00:42:53.102 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: I know.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:54.994 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing.

00:42:54.994 --> 00:42:56.035 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:42:56.035 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: I'm still so
excited by the work.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.725 align:middle line:90%
So then you took a trip that--

00:43:00.725 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.507 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me about
the trip to your homeland.

00:43:03.507 --> 00:43:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.310 align:middle line:90%
We went back to Ghana.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was another a dream
I had, where-- I remember,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Lisa-- next time
I see you-- I have

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:84%
this picture in my
garage of me standing

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
on the sandy beach of Ghana,
my hands outstretched,

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and I called it Tribal Oasis.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had, again, this vision
of taking youth to Ghana.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I stood there and took
that picture-- I don't know.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 10 years
ago-- I had no idea

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.326 align:middle line:90%
how it would all come together.

00:43:28.326 --> 00:43:30.619 align:middle line:90%
But it came together.

00:43:30.619 --> 00:43:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe it?

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to take-- we
did our first trip in 2012.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I had two or three teachers
with me and a probation officer.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We took four young
people that were just

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.370 align:middle line:84%
out of incarceration--
three of them.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.890 align:middle line:90%
One had never been incarcerated.

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:90%
But they were my mentors.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.757 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's go
and check it out

00:43:47.757 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and see if this can really work.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And then this past year, the
California Wellness Foundation

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:54.530 align:middle line:90%
sponsored us.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.820 align:middle line:84%
They're an amazing
organization-- one

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:90%
of our big sponsors.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They sponsored us to
take about-- there

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.670 align:middle line:84%
were 15 of us that
went to Ghana.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:04.384 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:44:04.384 --> 00:44:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did
you discover or what

00:44:05.925 --> 00:44:07.740 align:middle line:90%
did the children discover there?

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: They discovered
a greater voice.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.020 align:middle line:84%
They discovered their
passion for living.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.020 align:middle line:84%
They discovered
just how fortunate

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:84%
they are-- that they have
a lot going for them here

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.540 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Because back in
Ghana, they got to see

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.730 align:middle line:84%
kids that don't have
half what they have.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of them said, what
am I complaining about?

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.350 align:middle line:90%
I have so much.

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.995 align:middle line:90%
Let me get down and do my work.

00:44:30.995 --> 00:44:33.578 align:middle line:84%
I know the first trip, a lot of
them came back-- they're like,

00:44:33.578 --> 00:44:34.350 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm in school.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm working.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Why am I complaining?

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.360 align:middle line:84%
All I do is complain
and I have so much.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was really great for
them-- for me to watch them

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.450 align:middle line:84%
as they began to see all
that they've been given

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and that because of
what they've been given,

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.940 align:middle line:90%
they can do so much more.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you do
there when you get there?

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, boy.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a historical trip.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.960 align:middle line:84%
We go to the slave castle and we
do a releasing ceremony there,

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:84%
just releasing whatever
is in any of us--

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.550 align:middle line:84%
those places where we're wounded
that would make us go out

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.950 align:middle line:90%
and wound others.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's heal those wounds
within ourselves first.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So we do a beautiful
ceremony at the slave castle.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we continue
our writing practices.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.210 align:middle line:90%
We go hiking and swimming.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:84%
We also go there
to be of service.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.554 align:middle line:84%
So we took gifts--
toys and clothes--

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Clothes.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.926 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: --for the orphans.

00:45:25.926 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We went to the Osu
Children's Orphanage,

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.860 align:middle line:84%
which is one of Ghana's--
in the capital Accra,

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.490 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
orphanages there.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And we went and we
visited the kids.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We sponsored a
luncheon for them.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.950 align:middle line:90%
My mom is there, so we went.

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And she actually sponsored a
great deal of the luncheon.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And we hired cooks and chefs.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.511 align:middle line:90%
They made the food.

00:45:44.511 --> 00:45:45.010 align:middle line:90%
We went.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.884 align:middle line:84%
We fed all 300
kids and the staff

00:45:47.884 --> 00:45:49.050 align:middle line:90%
and then gave them the toys.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:49.775 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:45:49.775 --> 00:45:50.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the journey
that Akuyoe went on to Ghana

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.825 align:middle line:90%
with her four friends.

00:45:55.825 --> 00:45:56.798 align:middle line:90%

"First Time Africa,"

we follow a group of students
as they accompany their teacher

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.110 align:middle line:84%
back to her native
land of Ghana.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:84%
-This idea to take this trip
came from students of mine.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.057 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to see Africa.

00:46:11.057 --> 00:46:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them-- I said,
is it because I'm from Ghana?

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.510 align:middle line:84%
They said no, they've always
been fascinated with Africa.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke about going
to Africa on a service trip

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to visit an
orphanage or a school

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.991 align:middle line:84%
to bring some supplies to
the orphanage or the school.

00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't know how
we're going to do this,

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.990 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to say yes.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.920 align:middle line:90%
-I'm Jonni Encantra.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm from Los
Angeles, California.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm 18 years old.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to know most
of the countries

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.360 align:middle line:84%
in Africa-- like in sixth
grade, for geography class.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I know the Sahara
desert's on top,

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and then down at the
bottom is all green.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.550 align:middle line:90%
-Hi.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.674 align:middle line:90%
My name is Quiyona Bridges.

00:46:46.674 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm 19 years old.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Compton, California.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
out of the country.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:84%
We had to get
passports, the visas.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:90%

from West Covina, California.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:84%
What I know about Africa is
just that it's the motherland.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the origin of everything.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I know about
Ghana, specifically,

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is just that
Akuyoe's from there.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And if she is, then
the people must

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:90%
be beautiful and wonderful.

I'm 21 years old.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm originally from
Paterson, New Jersey.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:84%
This is my first time out of
the country, so this is amazing.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And for it to be Africa the
first time is like, woo.

-If you have a dream or
something you want to achieve,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:90%
say yes to it first.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrina, Jonni,
Christine, Quiyona-- they

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.510 align:middle line:90%
all say yes right away.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.700 align:middle line:84%
-My dream pretty much
all connected in one

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.340 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to creatively
express myself and make

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.610 align:middle line:90%
a lot of money doing it.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And that could be writing,
singing, acting, dancing,

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.140 align:middle line:84%
audio engineering,
mothering-- just

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to express
what's inside of me.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.720 align:middle line:90%
-I do want to pursue writing.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not about money or about
being successful with it.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.010 align:middle line:84%
More than anything, it's just
about being happy and using

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.910 align:middle line:90%
that because it makes me happy.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.780 align:middle line:84%
-I want to be a
teacher and I want

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to start my own
foundation later.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is another reason why
Akuyoe included me on the trip.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.410 align:middle line:84%
She's taking me to
see how it is or see

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:37.640 align:middle line:84%
how it would be to bring
your own foundation.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.200 align:middle line:84%
-I have a variety
of interests, but I

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.430 align:middle line:90%
want to stick to nonprofits.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to study business
because money and people really

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.304 align:middle line:90%
click with me.

00:48:47.304 --> 00:48:49.700 align:middle line:84%
-I emailed everybody
the itinerary, OK?

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So you all have
it on your emails.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Here's the camera.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
give that to-- who?

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.284 align:middle line:90%
To Jeffrina?

00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:56.950 align:middle line:90%
-Jeffrina, yeah.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:57.655 align:middle line:90%
-Oh, God.

00:48:57.655 --> 00:48:58.160 align:middle line:90%
All the responsibility.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:90%
-Do not lose-- yes.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Do not lose this camera.

Get out of here.

00:49:02.195 --> 00:49:02.320 align:middle line:90%

-OK.

Bye.

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:03.510 align:middle line:90%
-Bye.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:04.250 align:middle line:90%
-Bye.

-Is it recording?

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.640 align:middle line:90%
It says Record.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:84%
That means it's
recording, right?

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.910 align:middle line:84%

getting ready to go to Africa.

-Me and Frinna, during
the packing the night

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.880 align:middle line:84%
before the trip, we were just in
a twilight zone at that moment,

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.660 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted to travel,
but we couldn't picture it.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't real until
that moment that we

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.842 align:middle line:90%
were packing for the trip.

00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:31.814 align:middle line:90%

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:90%
-Good morning.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:42.180 align:middle line:84%
-I think that our
group is diverse enough

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and strong enough and everyone
will have their experience.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm confident that
it will be, whatever

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.544 align:middle line:84%
it is-- love it, like it,
hate it-- it'll be powerful.

00:49:53.544 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:84%
-These are clothes
for Christine brought

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:58.145 align:middle line:90%
to donate to the orphans.

00:49:58.145 --> 00:49:59.270 align:middle line:90%

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited for them.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:90%

that this was finally happening.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.070 align:middle line:84%

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:48.970 align:middle line:90%
-Right.

-When we first arrived,
I got off the airplane,

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:57.340 align:middle line:84%

a whoosh of heat.

-I felt weird because I had
to go in the immigrant line.

with the humidity and the heat.

the beginning, we saw,

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.160 align:middle line:90%
of your journey.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.345 align:middle line:90%
And so how often do you do this?

00:51:24.345 --> 00:51:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Every other year.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every other year?

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:26.865 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:51:26.865 --> 00:51:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do you
choose who to bring?

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.284 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: It's actually
self-selecting,

00:51:30.284 --> 00:51:34.340 align:middle line:84%
because they have to
have been of service.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Twice a month, as part
of the mentoring program,

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.390 align:middle line:90%
we go and volunteer.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So we look to see which
young people had been doing

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.610 align:middle line:84%
a volunteering work,
which one of them

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.110 align:middle line:84%
have been coming to meetings,
and where they're at,

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to see if they're mature enough.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Because what I tell
them is, you're

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:52.449 align:middle line:84%
ambassadors for
the United States

00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:53.740 align:middle line:90%
when you go out of the country.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.610 align:middle line:84%
You are representing
not only yourself,

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.151 align:middle line:84%
but you're representing
your country.

00:51:57.151 --> 00:51:58.655 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to represent.

00:51:58.655 --> 00:52:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, are
you ready for that?

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to
be an ambassador

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.450 align:middle line:90%
for your own country?

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you frame
it that way, it's

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.800 align:middle line:90%
really very self-selecting.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And we watch to see-- me and
my other artist facilitators,

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:14.777 align:middle line:84%
we look to see which ones
are always giving excuses.

I couldn't come to the

>>LISA: Right.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:20.094 align:middle line:84%
So they have to have
pre-qualifications and stick

00:52:20.094 --> 00:52:21.510 align:middle line:84%
with it for a long
period of time?

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.634 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yes.

00:52:21.634 --> 00:52:22.640 align:middle line:90%
For a period of time.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
self-selecting.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Very much so.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you keep up
your spiritual practice?

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.987 align:middle line:90%
You do so much for others.

00:52:28.987 --> 00:52:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it gives
back to you so much.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.611 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Oh, yeah.

00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

is your practice?

00:52:34.326 --> 00:52:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: I meditate.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I make sure that I feed
myself with great food,

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.902 align:middle line:84%

I teach the children

and eat well and hike and do

this isn't working out the way
I think it should or whatever.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.890 align:middle line:84%

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because not everyone
is gung ho about this program.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Although I will say--
I will say that I've

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.740 align:middle line:90%
been doing this for a long time.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And probation
officers and teachers

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.090 align:middle line:84%
will tell you they're used
to all kinds of people coming

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in promising the
world or whatever.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.619 align:middle line:84%
And at least they
know I'm consistent.

00:53:52.619 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a
good track record.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.931 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: And it speaks for
itself because at these sites,

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.410 align:middle line:84%
administration changes
every two years or so.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like there's
one particular principal who

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.015 align:middle line:84%
just loves me personally
and keeps bringing me in.

00:54:08.015 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:84%

years, there's

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:12.200 align:middle line:84%
a different administration--
different teachers

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that I have to be vetted by.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.299 align:middle line:84%

us in the facilities?

00:54:16.299 --> 00:54:16.840 align:middle line:90%

>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the children.

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We've had students that have
done-- they write letters.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They've written to the
Department of Justice.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:33.220 align:middle line:84%
They write letters to probation
officer saying, please

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.820 align:middle line:90%
bring this program back.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I bring students that have
been through our program

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:84%
back to the facilities to
meet the other children.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.180 align:middle line:84%
One of them is one of my
assistants, Quiyona Bridges,

with those children has
got to be so powerful.

00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: Very powerful,
because now they're

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.200 align:middle line:90%
not just hearing it from me.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And she can say, look,
I went from point A

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to point B. I was once
where you're sitting,

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.340 align:middle line:90%
right there, with my attitude.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I was an angry child.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.180 align:middle line:84%

she's now this elegant
young woman with dignity.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And if they'd told me that
she would be working with me,

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:25.400 align:middle line:90%
I would have said, oh, no.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.737 align:middle line:90%
With that attitude?

00:55:26.737 --> 00:55:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Back then, I would've
been like, no, no, no.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

But here she is, a

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.530 align:middle line:90%

necessarily even

to be doing this.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.140 align:middle line:84%

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And she has a daughter--
beautiful child.

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we call her the
little Spirit Awakening.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
is up for you now?

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've done
so much and you're

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.860 align:middle line:90%
going so many different places.

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: I know.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, celebrating
our 20th year,

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:84%
we have sort of some
major milestones

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.760 align:middle line:84%
we want to hit--
the Spirit House,

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.780 align:middle line:84%
really making sure that the
mentoring program is online,

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.737 align:middle line:84%
and then making the film out of
the play-- "Spirit Awakening."

00:56:17.737 --> 00:56:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I've written the
screenplay and it's--

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:20.715 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:56:20.715 --> 00:56:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of my other
mentors in the business

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.070 align:middle line:84%
is the producer Robert
Chartoff, who is a love.

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:28.490 align:middle line:90%
He did all the Rocky movies.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:30.446 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: And so
he's mentoring me

00:56:30.446 --> 00:56:33.070 align:middle line:84%
in terms of bringing this
story to the big screen.

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAHAM: So those
are the main things.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can't wait to see it.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Sounds exciting.

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You're up to so many things.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You've taught us so much and
just explaining your life

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.620 align:middle line:84%
about overcoming adversity,
about meeting new challenges,

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:50.890 align:middle line:84%
about taking action, about truly
authentically being who you are

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and healing herself
through helping others.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:56.490 align:middle line:84%
