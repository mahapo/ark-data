00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Today's topic
may seem like miracles to many,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:10%
if not most of us.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.890 align:middle line:10%
But to Jean Slatter,
these every day

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:10%
miracles are simply
our own creation.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:10%
After writing
"Hiring the Heavens,"

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
people from around
the world began

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:10%
writing to Jean telling of their
own miracles, which prompted

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:10%
her to begin teaching
and lecturing

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:10%
on how we can connect
with the "help"

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:10%
on the other side of the veil.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Today she's a popular
guest on shows such as ours

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
as her story is one
of joy and hope.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
And welcome, Jean.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN SLATTER:
Thank you so much.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have to tell
you after the last time we met,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
the first time we
met, in fact, I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
bought I think a
dozen of your books,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
gave them all away to the
point I don't have one anymore,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.944 align:middle line:84%
and I keep hearing
from people about it.

00:00:57.944 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:10%
And the other day
my son, Stewart,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:10%
was saying, hey, mom
do have that book,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.912 align:middle line:10%
"Hiring the Heavens?"

00:01:01.912 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:10%
I need to give it to
a friend of mine who

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
really needs that book.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
one single one left.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a tiny
little book, but probably

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:90%
one of the most useful books--

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It is.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --anyone can have.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just useful.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about you
and your start in all this,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't start
out looking for angels

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and looking to
"Hire the Heavens."

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Far from it.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I was running
from that subject.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.389 align:middle line:84%
I wanted nothing really
to do with anything

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:90%
that was spiritual.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to do my thing
as a traditional naturopath

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:10%
and never mind about anything
about a spiritual level.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:10%
So what happened
to me, though, was

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:10%
one of those pivotal moments
that changed everything.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:10%
It was so synchronistic
that there was just

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:10%
no way that I could just
dismiss it as pure coincidence.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:10%
So here's what happened.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:10%
I was working with a client in
my business as a naturopath,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:10%
and I had a way of
talking to the body.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I actually use a
pendulum to get answers,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
but the thing that the
body was telling me

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
was that I needed to
do a clearing, allergy

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
clearing for five
neurotransmitters.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Now neurotransmitters
are those chemicals

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:90%
that your brain produces.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:90%
So I had to name all five.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I only
knew about four.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I could only come up with
four that the body wanted,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and yet, the body
said I have to name

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
that fifth neurotransmitter.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So I said to my client, we're
going to have to reschedule,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
because I can't think of what
that fifth neurotransmitter is,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
so give me some time
to research this.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then my client who was
a layperson said, well,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:90%
is histamine a neurotransmitter?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, histamine
is not a neurotransmitter.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Histamine's that stuff
your sinuses produce

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
when you have an
allergic reaction.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's why
you take antihistamines.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And then in the very next
moment, I turn around,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and I pull a book off my
shelf that I had purchased

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
one year prior and
had never looked at.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It falls open to a page with
the word histamine in the title.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.572 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately get
a chuckle out of it.

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look at that, it's
talking about histamine.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And then in the next
nanosecond, my eyes

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
went to a line buried in
the paragraph that said,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
"Histamine is also thought
to be a neurotransmitter."

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
That was the moment
when the hair stood up

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
on the back of my
neck and on my arms,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and frankly, I couldn't
wait to do the clearing

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.021 align:middle line:84%
and get this client
out the door.

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And find out
what just happened.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I was reeling.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I sat there just
shaking, thinking, OK--

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
did that come from?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
what's going on?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that I could
come up with to explain that,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.247 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
explain that with--

00:03:56.247 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With just logic.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that I could
come up with to explain it

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is to imagine that I had
a spiritual physician

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
guiding me, and helping
me, and giving me

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:90%
information about my clients.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
cool would that

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
be that I could actually
get inside information

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:90%
from a higher source.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:10%
And so, from that
day on, I began

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:10%
to call upon my
spiritual physician

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:10%
as I would go to
work in the car.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:10%
I'd be driving down the
road talking and talking

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:10%
to my spiritual physicians
saying, OK, today

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:10%
we've got so-and-so coming in.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They've got issues with this
and that and can you help me

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
find the best herbal remedy,
or the best homeopathic?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And I started
receiving information

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that was just far
beyond my training.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Words that would come to me
like, where did that come from?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was clearly
getting information.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So then I decided, wow,
if I'm getting help

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
with this technical
information, perhaps

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
there's help for other
aspects of my business.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I need a spiritual
time manager, and I

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
need a spiritual
marketer, and I need

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual
financial consultant.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Could I bring those energies in
to work with me on my business?

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I imagined hiring them.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I did,
there was evidence

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that I was getting help
on all those levels.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Every morning I had my
staff meeting in my car.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I talked to them just as they
were sitting right next to me.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have our meeting,
and if I needed more clients,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd talk to my spiritual
marketer and, boom,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I'd get clients.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
If I needed my phone
calls held, I'd

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.506 align:middle line:84%
talk to my spiritual secretary,
and say, hold those calls,

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and my phone wouldn't ring.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.046 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
essentially, anything

00:05:39.046 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
that you put out
there was answered?

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It was.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that I had
never hired anybody

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.892 align:middle line:90%
on the physical level, because--

00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have them
on the spiritual level.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.266 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know
what's interesting,

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about this
particular event that

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.488 align:middle line:84%
had happened that gave you
this technical information

00:05:53.488 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:90%
about the histamines.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But I can't help but think,
as with most people out here

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
watching this right now, that we
have had these kinds of things

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:90%
happen in our life.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:90%
We do have these.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
They're happening maybe
even more regularly

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:90%
than we might think.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment we'll
recognize it and say,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that was weird, that was
weird, and then it's gone.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't give any
consideration to it.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Just one of those,
well, that was weird.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, if we
were paying attention

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to what's going on,
these little miracles

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
are happening all
the time around us.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But you took advantage
of the situation.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
You grabbed the
reins and decided

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to actually
start using it.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:90%
If it's there, let's use it.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So now, angels, the notion of
help has been around forever.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Many references to it in all
the great religious texts

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.702 align:middle line:84%
about beings, angels,
archangels, and so forth.

00:06:45.702 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
little survey done.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I have it right here.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:10%
Baylor University, although
that has a religious connota--

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.612 align:middle line:10%
affiliation, Baylor
University did a study

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:10%
in their studies of religion.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:10%
And it was asking people if they
believed in guardian angels?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And in that poll,
55% of the people

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:90%
did believe in guardian angels.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.050 align:middle line:10%
Including one in five
of those who said

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:10%
they were not religious
at all, but who

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:10%
felt that they had been
protected by a guardian

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:10%
angel at some point
during their lives.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.247 align:middle line:10%
So this is really pervasive,
yet, we don't use it.

00:07:18.247 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't call on it.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We believe in it, and we have
this sense that it's there,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and yet it isn't the common
language that you hear.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And we do tend to dismiss
those things that happen,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and think of it as
merely coincidence.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But if we capitalize on
that, and we culture that,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
nurture it, oh my gosh, we
can experience that far more.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.054 align:middle line:84%
We can experience
that on a daily basis.

00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the reality is
all these same religions that

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
refer to archangels and to
the angelic realms are also--

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean this
particularly negatively,

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
but most of the
world's religions

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
do put the person
in a lesser position

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to the hierarchy of
God and so forth.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we feel like we're
somehow less or not entitled.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Many people.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we tend
to only if we-- usually,

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
if you get a bad diagnosis,
or something horrible

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
has happened, or your
wife's about to leave you--

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
oh, please, God, if you
don't let this happen,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:90%
I promise I'll be better.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:10%
That's how most people--

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:10%


00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, it
goes into crisis mode,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:10%
and we go into
pleading, and begging,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:10%
and please help me
out, rather than

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:10%
in a position of commanding.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
extraordinary secret

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:84%
that I found out as
I started working

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:90%
with this more and more.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't just
keep it with my work.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.462 align:middle line:84%
I expanded this into
every aspect of my life.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
thought I was being

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
very audacious to
ask for something

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:90%
that was purely selfish.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:10%
Like, one of the things that
I asked for the first time

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.109 align:middle line:10%
was a spiritual wardrobe
consultant to go with me

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.525 align:middle line:10%
and help me pick
out some clothes.

00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:04.733 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We're women, right.

00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And I thought
that was rather brave of me.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they're not going
to listen to that request.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they did.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing I did is
ask for help with my children,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and ask for a spiritual
attitude adjuster.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:10%
And then I asked for
a spiritual mechanic,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:10%
and then I asked for a
spiritual connoisseur

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:10%
as we went on a trip.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:10%
And everything that
I asked for, it

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:10%
was jaw dropping, oh, my gosh.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I am getting everything
that I'm asking for.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
amazing to me that it

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
was quite clear that they
are, this unseen dimension,

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
is willing to help
out and delights

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
in helping out in every
aspect of your life.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And then it occurred to me.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.164 align:middle line:84%
They never wanted
to be separate,

00:09:48.164 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and they never wanted
to be just sitting

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:90%
back waiting for a crisis.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, will they please call on us.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And I mean we can take this
a number of different ways.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Another way to also
tap into it, and I

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
know that you've had a lot
of experience with this

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
as well, is that we say
is it an external force

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
or is it a higher aspect of
ourselves that is reaching

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum field
of all information

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing
this information

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and these potentials
back into our reality?

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, it
really doesn't matter.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: It doesn't matter,
and it's a wonderful way

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:10%
to live your life.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.322 align:middle line:84%
It brings about a
whole different grace.

00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It brings about
grace in your life.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
But I will say this.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I have talked to enough people
that are clairvoyant and see

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
angels, that I've come
to believe in angels.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I am not clairvoyant, but
one of my favorite stories

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:84%
was of a lady who
called me up and said

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that she has worked
with the angels

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
ever since she was very
young and sees them.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And after she read
my book, though, it

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
brought in a dimension
she had not thought about.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Because she, like most people,
had only used the angels

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:84%
for the big ticket items
or for a time of crisis.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And carefully used
that resource.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Didn't want to push it too far.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: But after
reading my book,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:10%
and I encourage people to bring
that energy in for everything

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:10%
that you're doing in your life.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So she put together a
committee, a committee of angels

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:90%
for every aspect of her life.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:90%
She had a life path committee.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
She had a relationship
committee.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
She had a committee
for her children,

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
for her work, every
aspect of her life.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And she took an entire
evening to fill out

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
all of her committee pages,
writing them all out,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
telling them what she
wanted them to do.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Exhausted, she fell asleep.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The next morning when she woke
up, because she's clairvoyant,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
when she opened her eyes,
she saw them everywhere.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
She said there was so
much commotion going on,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
she could hardly believe
what she was seeing.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And she said there were even
some that she hadn't hired,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
saying, we heard
you were hiring.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Have you got a job for us?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
her like a resume

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:90%
of what they were good at.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So it helped me to
realize that there-- it

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what specialty
you're talking about.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.355 align:middle line:84%
There is a specialist in this
unseen dimension to help you.

00:12:24.355 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Jean,
that's, I think,

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important things
for me in reading your book.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm very comfortable
with all of this.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've been talking
with my guides

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and utilizing them
for many, many years.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
However, just like the
women you spoke about,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd go months without
asking for any kind of help.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd just slog through and just,
I can figure this out on my own

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.799 align:middle line:90%
and do it on my own.

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And really, it wasn't until I
read that book that I realized,

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:90%
what am I waiting for?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Why have I wasted so much of my
own personal resources trying

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to work through or
figure something

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
out when you can get
the information so much

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:90%
more quickly doing it this way?

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and
it's so simple.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:10%
It's just as near as
your next thought.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:10%
All you have to do is imagine
that the spiritual world

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:10%
is every bit as complex
as our own physical plane.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And that just like we have-- if
you open up the yellow pages,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:84%
you'll find carpenters, you'll
find marketing specialists,

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:90%
you'll find interior decorators.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine that you have
the universal yellow pages,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find a
listing in there

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:84%
for every possible
specialty you can imagine.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.735 align:middle line:84%
And even if you've never seen
a title for this position

00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
on the physical
level, you can be

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.609 align:middle line:84%
sure it's there on
the spiritual level.

00:13:47.609 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
can conceive of it--

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.498 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --it's there.

00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So all you do is
imagine that that specialist is

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
there and available to
you, and then you ask.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
as simple as that.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.464 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't get any more
complicated than that.

00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:10%
People are always asking
me, well, how do I do this?

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly how do I ask?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And what do I say
and all of that?

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:10%
Well, the one thing I tell
people is the beauty of this is

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:10%
you can't.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:10%
There's no one way
to do this right,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:10%
and you can't get it wrong.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:10%
So merely talk to them like
they're your best friends.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
your P's and Q's all

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
lined up, and your
questions all in place.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
You can be doing
it on the fly just

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
talking to them like you're
talking to a best friend

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you know
what, I was kind

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about doing this
and this, what do you think?

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.257 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could help
me out, and maybe you

00:14:40.257 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
could help me make some
decisions about that.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It can be as simple as that.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And I do my staff meetings
usually while I'm driving

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
or before bed, but
any time, any place,

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:90%
there are no rules about this.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the real thing
here is only one thing,

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's a little leap of faith.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
For some people it's
not, but for most people

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:90%
it's a leap of faith.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is, A, I'm totally
worthy of all the help

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:90%
there is to be given.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And, B, it's by agreement
on the other side.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm worthy and it's there.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
have a hard time

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in this cynical world thinking
there is actually help there.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's nice sweetheart.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Sunshine, roses, angel
dust and everything,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
not understanding this is
a very complex universe.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's multi-dimensional
and a being

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
that I have a great amount
of respect for once told me,

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I said, what is it with guides
and the whole notion of angels?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Why does our species
even need them?

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's up with that?

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And they said because of a
rift within our own psyche

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
where we don't even know
our own deep history.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.945 align:middle line:84%
We can't even remember who
we are on a soul level.

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's it.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we keep
talking about the great time

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
of awakening, which
we're in right now.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The idea is we're awakening
to ourselves, our memory

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
or recalling our memory of who
we are, what we're here to do.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Without that, it's very hard to
smoothly move through our life

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and transition
into whatever it is

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to transition into.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.873 align:middle line:84%
And they said for
this reason, there's

00:16:10.873 --> 00:16:12.915 align:middle line:84%
been an agreement
from the beginning.

00:16:12.915 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That other
realms will work with you,

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.454 align:middle line:84%
and it is their pleasure
to work with you.

00:16:19.454 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Absolutely.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they grow, too.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what it's like
working with a human being that

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.276 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know you're there,
and you're trying as best you

00:16:28.276 --> 00:16:30.677 align:middle line:84%
can to help them, and you
can't get through to them.

00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Imagine how clever--

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: And they won't ask.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they won't ask.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The amount of
ingenuity and energy

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
it takes to get through
to one of us to help us.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
yeah, my guidance

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
said there are thousands and
thousands of unemployed angels.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.464 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:44.464 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: You never
have to worry about

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.171 align:middle line:90%
that your bothering them.

00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
You're giving them a
job, and they love that.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:10%
And you know,
about that, I think

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:10%
that this is the
time where we really

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:10%
have to come to an
awareness about this,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:10%
because we have talked about,
and many religious talk about,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:10%
how the God is within us.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And that we are all
one, and we're all

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:90%
made of the same stuff.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, how is it
that we can actually

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:90%
live that in our everyday life?

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:90%
How can we make that practical?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
How can we take that
from being something

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that we hear on--
at Sunday school

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:90%
to something that we can apply?

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Engage with.

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, and apply.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:10%
So is there a way that we can
bring that power right down

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:10%
here to Earth to use
in our everyday life?

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:10%
To me, this whole idea and
notion of hiring the heavens

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.204 align:middle line:10%
is the quickest, fastest--

00:17:35.204 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's direct.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
funnest way to do it.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
no ritual around it.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what your
religious background is

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
or your spiritual
background, it's just there

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:90%
to be dipped into and utilized.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:90%
And we have so many examples.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I learn well by
examples, and I would

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
love for you to share
a couple of examples.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I would like to share
a couple as well where

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I've done the same thing.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And one of them I
really like is a story

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
about a little boy who had
a report due at school.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And you know which
one I'm talking about.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Could you share
that story with us?

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, and I'm so
glad that you're asking me,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
because even though this is in
the book, the ending is not.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to tell it here.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: What happened
was Logan needed

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to do a report in grade school
for a famous football hero.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And he and all the
other boys decided

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:90%
to do it on Joe Montana.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So he came home
frustrated from school

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
saying that all the books
at the school library

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
had been checked
out on Joe Montana.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So the mom says, well, we'll
go down to the city library.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.670 align:middle line:90%
We'll find one.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So he was in the city
library for an hour

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
while his mom and the younger
daughter were outside playing.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:10%
For an hour he searched.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.035 align:middle line:10%
He came out so
frustrated, he thought

00:18:52.035 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:10%
he was-- he was about at tears.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, mom, all the
books have been checked out

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:90%
on Joe Montana.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.250 align:middle line:10%
I can't find one.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:10%
Then she remembered about
"Hiring the Heavens."

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.241 align:middle line:10%
She said, I've got
an idea for you.

00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:10%
Why don't you go back in
and look one more time.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And he resisted,
and she insisted.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And so he turned
around, walked back in,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
she gathered up the
daughter, and followed him

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
about three minutes behind.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And there he is standing in
the checkout line with a 12

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:84%
by 18 book, with the word
Montana across the top

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and a picture of Joe, which
is exactly what he wanted.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:90%
So she said, this is perfect.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Where did you find this?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, did I tell you that she
hired a spiritual homework

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:90%
assistant?

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I think that I missed that.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we get
that she hired someone,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.402 align:middle line:90%
because she had read your book.

00:19:43.402 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, she remembered
about "Hiring the Heavens,"

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and hired a spiritual homework
assistant to go with him

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
and help him find this book.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So there he is,
standing in line,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and she asked him
where he found it.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:10%
He says, well, mom, I went
back to the sports section

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:10%
where I'd looked before.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And I thought to myself, what if
a book fell behind the shelves?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:10%
So I stuck my head in between,
and there was this book on end.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled it
up, and here it is.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the
end of this story.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The part that just goes
into the realm of miracles,

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
you cannot explain
this any other way.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
That book was not in the
library's computer system.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.842 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: How do
you explain that?

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.093 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't.

00:20:31.093 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And talking
about miracles,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.174 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just
could go on and on.

00:20:35.174 --> 00:20:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the thing
is people catalog these,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and they write to
you from everywhere.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:90%
You've heard thousands of these.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.711 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: They do.

00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
not to dismiss these.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is a miracle.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:10%
And we try to find some way
that we can rationalize this,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:10%
some way that we can
logic it, but I'll

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:10%
tell you another story.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And this came from some
lady that wrote to me.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.832 align:middle line:10%
In the book, I tell a story
about a jewelry sleuth

00:21:01.832 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:10%
that found a missing pearl.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.902 align:middle line:10%
Well, she wrote to me and said--

00:21:06.902 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Not the woman in
the book, a different one?

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: A different one.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:10%
So she wrote to me and said
that her mother had passed away,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:10%
and the one thing she really
wanted to have from her mother

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:10%
was an opal ring that had
been promised to her since she

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:10%
was four years old.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:10%
And after a year and a half
of scouring her mother's home

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:10%
trying to find that ring,
she had all but given up.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Then she read
"Hiring the Heavens."

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And read the part in
there about another person

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:10%
who had hired a
spiritual jewelry sleuth.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So she thought,
what the heck, OK.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So she hired that same jewelry
sleuth to find that ring

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
and to bring it to her.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, she's doing
her laundry, all right?

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.416 align:middle line:90%
You've got to picture this.

00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: She's
doing her laundry,

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and there is-- she's
matching up socks.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
There's one of them
that is all knotted up,

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
so she's untying
the knot, and she

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:90%
feels something heavy in there.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Reaches her hand in
and pulls out the ring.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are these
socks she had worn before?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.135 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:22:13.135 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
is, I mean, that's

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
where you have to-- I mean,
it's very tempting to write that

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%
down, and that was really
weird, and just forget

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
about categories,
but the fact is

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.945 align:middle line:84%
that is what we and our
guides are capable of.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they work
beyond, A, the time space

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
continuum, beyond
physical density.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.695 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: They don't
have limitations.

00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:36.444 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
have our limitations.

00:22:36.444 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We, our higher half,
our higher self,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.066 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have those
limitations either.

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, that,
I mean, it does

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.395 align:middle line:90%
sound like a flat out miracle.

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And there are others.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
times when guides

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
come in and help with
emergency situations.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And you know of some of these.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I know of some.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I have to share one
I learned of recently

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:90%
that was just astounding.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know of
very similar ones.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
This is one of our interviewees
had a near death experience.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And he told me this off camera.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
When he was young,
many years ago,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:84%
he was riding a motorcycle
in another country.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was riding fast, because
he was a young man, right?

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But as he was coming down
the freeway at about 90 miles

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
an hour, he saw far
off in the distance

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:84%
a large truck, a
semi-truck, and it's

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
as though something in his being
was magnetized to that truck.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what it was,
but he kept looking at it

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
as though he didn't
know what it was.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He was still in the
moment riding his bike,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:90%
but he was very aware of it.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:84%
When it came time
for the two to pass,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
the truck went over the barrier
region right into his lane.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:84%
He was trapped, because
another car was right here,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:90%
so he had nowhere to go.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So he knew it was over.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
He closed his eyes and
just let it happen.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And as he closed his
eyes, a voice said to him,

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
open your eyes and you
will see more beauty

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:90%
than you have ever seen.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, why
should I open my eyes?

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I have only a second
or so to live.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But he did, he opened his
eyes, and he was somewhere else

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.139 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:24:16.139 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing story.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
He was somewhere else, shown
other things, other realities.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And in a very
quick space of time

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
experienced many, many
things in another place

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:90%
beyond the time space continuum.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But what actually happened
is his bike was crushed.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.969 align:middle line:84%
He was found by the police just
sitting on the road, untouched.

00:24:37.969 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Amazing.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.509 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't
have a scratch on him.

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
He was just sitting on the
road about 100 feet away.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:84%
He has no knowledge, no
one has any knowledge

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
of what actually
happened to him.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And a very similar thing with
a friend of mine recently.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:90%
He lost-- it's horrible.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
He lost his son
to a car accident.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:84%
His daughter, then, last year,
was in a horrible car accident

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.532 align:middle line:90%
where she should have been dead.

00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And she, afterwards, she came
out with just a broken ankle.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Even her dog was OK.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And what happened-- and what
happened according to her

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:84%
was she said, I don't
know, just as impact came,

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I felt my brother's
arms around me,

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
anything else.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.136 align:middle line:90%
She was fine.

00:25:21.136 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:90%
She lived through it.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.642 align:middle line:90%
The car didn't.

00:25:22.642 --> 00:25:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was mangled.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.042 align:middle line:90%
She should have been dead.

00:25:25.042 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where our
guides are intervening

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
without our request
on an emergency level.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I think many of us have
experienced degrees of this,

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.192 align:middle line:84%
like the people in this Baylor
study they were talking about.

00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:10%
And so if they can intervene
in a time of crisis like that,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:10%
is there a way that we can
also bring that power in just

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:10%
on an everyday level?

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell
one more little one.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:90%
This one's personal.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
couple of minutes,

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.533 align:middle line:90%
then we're going to break.

00:25:57.533 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell it that fast.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I was in Paris, and
I was with my son.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And we went down into the
Metro system underground.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been in that
system many times,

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and I don't make mistakes
when I read the signs.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I never have, ever.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And this particular day, I
read the signs, we go down.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:84%
We get on the train,
find out we're

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:90%
going the wrong direction.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I thought, how did that happen?

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.752 align:middle line:90%
I know what I saw.

00:26:21.752 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, come on, honey,
grabbed his hand,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
ran up across the top,
down, got to the platform

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:90%
to go back where we were.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And got back there to the
train we should have been on,

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:90%
and the doors closed.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, the doors
closed right on us.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were right there.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
no more trains came.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to hear--
people were piling up,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:90%
it was sweaty, rush hour.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I hear
over the loudspeaker

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.020 align:middle line:84%
some kind of information
being given but my French

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:84%
was not good enough to
understand the nuances.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's going,
ah, and it turns out,

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:84%
it made the television, that
car we would have gotten in

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:90%
was blown up at the next stop.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Many people died in that famous
Parisian Metro terrorist event

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:90%
that occurred.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking, I
don't know how I misread it.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: When you have
an experience like that,

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:90%
it changes you forever.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, you certainly know
you've got help anyway.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with that,
sometimes the things

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:90%
we want to happen don't happen.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.981 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason
for that as well.

00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take a little
break for a couple minutes,

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.354 align:middle line:84%
and when we come back,
we'll talk about that.

00:27:28.354 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.492 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:31.492 --> 00:27:46.955 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.955 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
to tell you what

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:90%
just happened on the break.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And it may have happened to some
of you watching this right now

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.984 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of
fact, because this

00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is what this-- that's why I
just love your work, Jean.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:90%
This is what it brings up.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.921 align:middle line:90%
Jay, who is our producer here.

00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have read
some of Jay Weidner's books.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.994 align:middle line:90%
He also hosts here on occasion.

00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
He said I got to tell
you what happened to me.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was driving in
the country years and years

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:90%
ago on my motorcycle.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Motorcycle, Jay?

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Car.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Car, reckless, driving
too fast on a country road,

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:90%
and he admitted it.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, all of a sudden
he heard a voice, slow down.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, OK,
wherever that came from,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.395 align:middle line:90%
I will slow down.

00:28:21.395 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And as he came
around the corner,

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:84%
there was a little
kid on a tricycle.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Saved that little guy's life,
and thank you for sharing that,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Jay.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:90%
And your life as well.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, I think that's
what's so amazing is he said,

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
gee, I had forgotten
all about that.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Not even putting together
that whatever was helping him

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
with that can help them with
this show and everything--

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.669 align:middle line:90%
every other challenge Jay.

00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: And that's it.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.850 align:middle line:10%
And so we have something
extraordinary happen to us,

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:10%
and then we think that it
is just that one event, just

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.975 align:middle line:10%
that one thing is where
we got intervention.

00:28:54.975 --> 00:28:57.734 align:middle line:10%
But what if it could be
so much more than that?

00:28:57.734 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's the point isn't it?

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.025 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
what if it could

00:29:01.025 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:10%
be something that is part
of your everyday life?

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:10%
Honestly, Regina,
I have used-- I've

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:10%
talked to my spiritual
hires every single day

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:10%
for 15 years or more,
and there is just

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:10%
not a day that I don't
tune in several times a day

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:10%
and talk to my guides
because-- to bring them

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.132 align:middle line:10%
in for everything.

00:29:21.132 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have to say,
after I met you and interviewed

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:84%
you the first time, and then,
because I had read this book,

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and it struck me the same way.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I was like, gosh, why am
I doing this all the time?

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I started doing that as well.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And I am constantly
shocked and delighted

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.170 align:middle line:84%
at the clever ways, when
I put something out there,

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:90%
that the requests are answered.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And they are virtually
always answered.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But sometime-- now, I
don't have this too much,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's very little
that they don't take care of.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's my higher
self, whether it's

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
my guides on the outside,
I don't really care.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.590 align:middle line:90%
It's taken care of.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
there are sometimes

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.665 align:middle line:84%
people have written to you
and said, you know I asked,

00:30:03.665 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that phenomena.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, and you know,
there could be several reasons.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
most important part

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.309 align:middle line:84%
to remember is to write
down these things that

00:30:14.309 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:84%
happen that are miracles
and remember them.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Because, for
me, I don't get everything

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
that I ask for.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:10%
I don't.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.070 align:middle line:10%
But I never go to that
place where I say, well,

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:10%
I know you guys have taken
care of me the last 100 times,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:10%
but you didn't do it this time.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:90%
So there, I've lost faith.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.642 align:middle line:90%
I never go to that place.

00:30:36.642 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what they
call throwing the baby out

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:39.683 align:middle line:90%
with the bath water.

00:30:39.683 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So remember the times
that they do work for you.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes there's
a whole issue with timing

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that you can't explain.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.673 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That, I would
say, because I might

00:30:50.673 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
ask for something, it might
take time for it to happen,

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.115 align:middle line:90%
but I know that.

00:30:55.115 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
manifesting things

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.274 align:middle line:84%
in a clever way on a
lot of different levels.

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it's
going to happen tomorrow.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:90%
But it always happens.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.704 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: I had two
people write to me

00:31:03.704 --> 00:31:05.720 align:middle line:10%
that used that same
jewelry sleuth,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:10%
and they asked
for an entire year

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:10%
for their ring to be replaced.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And they were-- one lady said
that she looked in her jewelry

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:10%
box, and she had a place where
her ring was supposed to be

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:10%
and wasn't there.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:10%
And she said, please
return it to me,

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:24.017 align:middle line:10%
and she looked, she said, month
after month for that ring.

00:31:24.017 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:10%
And she wrote to me, and she
said, it's still not there,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:10%
it's still not there.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.215 align:middle line:10%
After one year--

00:31:29.215 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: She found it.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.030 align:middle line:90%
She put it out.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: One morning,
she opened that drawer,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:90%
and there it was.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine how you'd feel?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean, to me, sometimes
it feels almost as

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:10%
if that is a way of
emphasizing that this is truly

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:10%
a miracle that's happening.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: And I had to go
through quite a test of faith

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:10%
when it came to writing my book.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:10%
I got the message from
my spiritual book writing

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:10%
committee that I needed
to get this published

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:10%
through a major publisher.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, who
should I send it to?

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And they guided me and
said New World Library.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, New World Library
published "The Power of Now."

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I looked them up, and I said,
oh, this is a great place.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll send my book off to them.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:10%
Little did I know that that's
not the way you publish books.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.752 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No, it
doesn't work that way.

00:32:17.752 --> 00:32:20.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Little did I know
that what you're supposed to do

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.092 align:middle line:10%
is go to these very
expensive seminars.

00:32:23.092 --> 00:32:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
agents, and so forth.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: And get an agent.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.944 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to learn how
to write your book proposal.

00:32:27.944 --> 00:32:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to do a
press kit, and all that,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.472 align:middle line:84%
and submit your proposal to at
least 30 different publishers.

00:32:35.472 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get turned
down by all of them.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Hit the next set
of 30 publishers,

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and the list goes on and on of
the things you have to hope,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
finally, somebody
picks up your book.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do
that when you're

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:84%
talking about
"Hiring the Heavens."

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it the hard way.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So I simply asked them, who's
going to publish my book?

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I submit my book
to New World Library,

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
without a book proposal,
without a press kit, nothing.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Just a little note that
said you guys are the ones.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And then I waited.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, two weeks went by,
and they didn't call.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:84%
A month, two months, three
months, four months, and I'm

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
thinking, why
aren't they calling?

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, I knew
I heard right.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that they would,
but five months goes by,

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:84%
six months, and on the
seventh month they called.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did it have
to take seven months?

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:90%
To this day, I still don't know.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the thing that we

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.300 align:middle line:84%
don't understand in
many things in life.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with
my own intuition

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and with my own
guides, that's why

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm so patient on
the time element,

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:51.207 align:middle line:84%
because there are variables
that we are not aware of.

00:33:51.207 --> 00:33:53.290 align:middle line:84%
For everyone, for example,
trying to get your book

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:53.790 align:middle line:90%
published.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were going
through a transition

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.574 align:middle line:84%
in their editorial
team at that time.

00:33:57.574 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And it might have been that
the editors at that time

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:84%
would not have been
open to that message.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a new person had to come.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe someone got sick.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't know all of the
factors that happen just

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
to have a book put into
print, for example.

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another area, too,

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is you're talking about
beings of consciousness that

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:84%
have their own internal
moral guideline, so to speak,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what they're
willing to help you with.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.399 align:middle line:84%
Which, is for the most part,
ask and you shall receive.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Ask and you shall receive, but
if you're asking for something

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.317 align:middle line:84%
that either they can see is not
in your best interest, period.

00:34:34.317 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Thank goodness.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or it's maybe not
even in their best interest

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:90%
to get involved in that one.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.527 align:middle line:84%
That's another level here, and
want you to talk about that.

00:34:42.527 --> 00:34:44.610 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: I'm so grateful
for that, because there

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:10%
have been things that I've
asked for that, in my enthusiasm

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:10%
for the moment, I
thought that I wanted.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:10%
Thank goodness they knew better.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.050 align:middle line:10%
Like, when I first
started speaking

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:10%
about "Hiring the Heavens,"
I thought, oh, I'm

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:10%
going to be in front
of 2,000 people

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:10%
and doing these fantastic
seminars and all of that.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, I realized that
what they did instead

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.050 align:middle line:10%
for me is gradually built
up my audience level.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
They started small,
and they gradually

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
began to add more
and more people.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.356 align:middle line:10%
If I had been hit right
off the bat with 2,000,

00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:21.655 align:middle line:10%
I would have gone nutty.

00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wouldn't have
been able to handle it.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I would
have gone nutty.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So thank goodness
they know what they're doing,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.632 align:middle line:84%
and they've got my
best interest at heart.

00:35:28.632 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
interesting, because there's

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:90%
another little conundrum here.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.581 align:middle line:84%
One of them is you say, you
can be very specific with them,

00:35:35.581 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and you can.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You can say I need a
blue blouse, and I'm lazy

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and I hate to shop, and show
me a picture, where do I go?

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
when you're looking

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
to manifest things of a larger
nature that really take buy in

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and cooperation on
a lot of people,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.540 align:middle line:84%
it's almost better to ask
those kinds of things,

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:84%
from my own perspective
and experience,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
on a little more
open ended level.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.372 align:middle line:84%
Which then gets you into
more of the feeling of it.

00:36:02.372 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about the feeling,

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.666 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to segue
into "The Power of Now,"

00:36:06.666 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and actually-- not "The
Power of Now," but "The Law

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:12.634 align:middle line:84%
of Intention" and get into
the differences here as well.

00:36:12.634 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.160 align:middle line:10%
You know when I was
first writing the book,

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:10%
my developmental
editor turned me

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:10%
on to "The Law of Attraction."

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.370 align:middle line:10%
And when I was first reading
about it, I thought to myself,

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:10%
this is how this is working.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:10%
But as the years
have gone by, I have

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:10%
come to believe that it's
very, very different.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea of
"The Law of Attraction"

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.140 align:middle line:84%
is about finding the right
formula to do it right.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.040 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it with feeling.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
your emotions in it.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of rules
about, well, be specific.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Or be specific, and then ask
once, and then let it go.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask again.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.360 align:middle line:10%
Or that you've got to
be in the present tense,

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:10%
and you can't say the word want.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And the list goes on and on.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And then even when
it's not working,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.390 align:middle line:90%
then it goes into well, why?

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm doing
everything right,

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
so why isn't it
happening for me?

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not manifesting it?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, you find
out, well, you've

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:84%
got to deal with your
subconscious beliefs.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to
deal with your karma.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And oh, it just goes on
and on of all the things

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that might be in
the way of you not

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:84%
manifesting what it is
that you were asking for.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So I realized, once I learned
more and more about it,

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not that it negates
"The Law of Attraction,"

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe that "The Law
of Attraction" works,

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.900 align:middle line:90%
but there's so much more.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.460 align:middle line:90%
There's something beyond that.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:10%
And that is this law of
grace where none of that

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:10%
is necessary, none
of that is required.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea of feeling
and an attitude of gratitude

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.520 align:middle line:84%
ends up happening by
being a playful creator.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:10%
And that was the biggest
thing that I got out

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.860 align:middle line:10%
of working with
this whole notion

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:10%
and inviting in
this unseen help.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:10%
As the years went by, I began to
really understand that who I am

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.237 align:middle line:10%
is a creator.

00:38:16.237 --> 00:38:16.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.194 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Who am
I is a creator.

00:38:18.194 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I'm here to do.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to create.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of the heavenly realm
is here to support me in that.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
me figuring out

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.810 align:middle line:84%
how to do things just right, so
that I can be worthy of that.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:10%
It's about me deciding how
I want to create my life,

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.866 align:middle line:10%
and then calling
upon that assistance.

00:38:39.866 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
the other element of that

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.055 align:middle line:10%
is there has to be an internal
sense of congruenty or truth.

00:38:45.055 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's one
thing that happens a lot.

00:38:47.983 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:84%
People will say, I really want
to have this particular job,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and I want to make
this amount of money.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:90%
But maybe it's driven by a fear.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is really critical.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.102 align:middle line:84%
If it's driven by a fear,
like I really should do this.

00:39:01.102 --> 00:39:03.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I really
want, it's that I really

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.566 align:middle line:84%
should do that, because
I really need that.

00:39:05.566 --> 00:39:08.910 align:middle line:84%
That is not the same kind of
appeal that you're putting out.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:13.240 align:middle line:84%
That is not that joyful
creation or co-creation

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It's actually,
oftentimes, even a lie

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.782 align:middle line:84%
that we're telling
ourselves out of need.

00:39:22.782 --> 00:39:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.656 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Can you talk about
that, and some evidence

00:39:25.656 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:10%
you've seen of that as well?

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Well, you know,
it's kind of interesting.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:10%
When we come to a place
where we are asking either,

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:10%
or our motivation is a fear,
or a concern about worthiness,

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:10%
you know what I have found
is that we don't ask then.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:10%
We don't even ask.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.477 align:middle line:90%
Then we try to figure it out.

00:39:48.477 --> 00:39:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, some
people will, they'll beg.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.875 align:middle line:90%
I need that job so badly.

00:39:51.875 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Even if that job's the worst
thing in the world for them.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.041 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Exactly.

00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:10%
And thank goodness
then that our guidance

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.900 align:middle line:10%
knows what's in our
highest and greatest good.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.140 align:middle line:10%
And I just find that those
requests aren't fulfilled.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:10%
But I have also seen that in
times when we feel like we are

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:10%
unworthy to ask, then we won't.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:10%
We'd rather not.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:10%
And this happened one
time when a lady came

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.560 align:middle line:10%
in who had, like you,
purchased, I don't know,

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.750 align:middle line:10%
20,30 books to give out to
all of her friends and family.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:10%
And she was having a ball
with it, absolute ball.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:10%
And she was doing everything
from clearing away

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:32.577 align:middle line:10%
the bees from a party,
keeping the bees away.

00:40:32.577 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:39.945 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Or winning a raffle
ticket, little things like that

00:40:39.945 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:10%
that put a smile on
your face and just

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:10%
make you feel so
joyful and so light.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:10%
But she said to me,
there is one thing

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:10%
that I haven't been
able to ask for.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, what's that?

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:10%
And she says, well, I borrowed
my grandmother's diamond

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.585 align:middle line:10%
bracelet, and I lost it.

00:40:57.585 --> 00:40:59.537 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, more
jewelry stuff.

00:40:59.537 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, she's
like, I'm just terrible,

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.850 align:middle line:10%
and I haven't been
able to find it.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:10%
I haven't been able to
admit to my grandmother yet.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.799 align:middle line:10%
It's been a couple
weeks, and I know

00:41:09.799 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:10%
I've got to confront
her and tell her

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:10%
that I don't have
your diamond bracelet,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:10%
but I just am so
scared to do that.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And I feel so bad.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.880 align:middle line:10%
And I said, oh, you
feel that because--

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're a bad girl.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: --you're
a bad girl that you

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.856 align:middle line:10%
can't ask for the
heavens to bail you out.

00:41:28.856 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:10%
I said forget that.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Ask.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:90%
So immediately, she did.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.620 align:middle line:84%
She said, OK, well, help
me find my bracelet.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.330 align:middle line:10%
She left my office, goes out to
the car, she gets in the seat.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:10%
And then promptly gets out,
because a thought occurs to her

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.580 align:middle line:10%
that maybe it's under the front
seat of the driver's seat.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.772 align:middle line:90%
It's under the seat.

00:41:50.772 --> 00:41:52.980 align:middle line:84%
She pulls the seat forward,
and there's the bracelet.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.146 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep, there you go.

00:41:54.146 --> 00:41:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't require
our being a saint.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It requires our being
here in a body on this planet,

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and this is--

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.142 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: And just being human.

00:42:04.142 --> 00:42:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And being
human, and this

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.232 align:middle line:84%
is a cooperative arrangement
with these other realms.

00:42:09.232 --> 00:42:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to talk about the
other realms a little bit, OK?

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.815 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
are very sensitive,

00:42:13.815 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and can see into these
other realms, like the women

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.930 align:middle line:84%
you talked about that
could see angels.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are other people who
can see in this near dimension,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:84%
often called the astral
realm, which oftentimes, maybe

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.440 align:middle line:84%
disincarnate beings are there,
haven't fully made transition.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It's an in between space.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens
when people, maybe it

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.550 align:middle line:84%
might be interfacing
with that thinking

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.394 align:middle line:90%
that these are their guides.

00:42:39.394 --> 00:42:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a lot
of beings of all kinds

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.226 align:middle line:90%
wanting our attention.

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, now what I do is I
call on a specific talent.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So if I am needing
help with my car,

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.810 align:middle line:84%
I call on the
spiritual mechanic.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And believe me,
they're brilliant.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely brilliant.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.790 align:middle line:10%
I find going shopping for gifts,
I call upon the gift angel.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:10%
If I am needing help
putting on a party,

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:10%
I put together a whole
committee for a knock

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.391 align:middle line:10%
your socks off party.

00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you're not
interfacing with those others,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.150 align:middle line:10%
because you're
being very specific.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.561 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: I'm callin upon a
specific talent and ability.

00:43:17.561 --> 00:43:19.060 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
makes a difference,

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.610 align:middle line:10%
and I have a very optimistic
viewpoint of the world.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
as above, so below.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think everything
mirrors everything.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:10%
And so being in the
world of natural health,

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:10%
I can tell you about bacteria.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell
you, you know what

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.920 align:middle line:84%
happens in the
world of bacteria,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and I think that is reflected
across the universe.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: So in bacteria, there
are thousands and thousands

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.980 align:middle line:10%
of strains of bacteria,
and that our lives depend

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.290 align:middle line:10%
on these strains of bacteria.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:57.090 align:middle line:10%
And out of all of them,
there's only about 10%

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:10%
that is maybe our
bodies could do without

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.270 align:middle line:10%
or our world could do without.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.980 align:middle line:10%
And then, it seems
like, out of that,

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:10%
2% would actually do you in.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:10%
So out of all these thousands
of strains, there's only 2%

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:10%
that will do you in if they
got the chance, all right.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, think about that.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.010 align:middle line:10%
If we take that same
analogy and place it

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:10%
into the spiritual
realm, we have

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:10%
98% of this whole
entire spiritual realm

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.020 align:middle line:10%
that is there to assist us.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.020 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we couldn't
live our lives--

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.190 align:middle line:10%
we couldn't be the creators
that we are without their help.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think that's true.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
something that you

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:43.500 align:middle line:84%
feel kind of creepy that's going
on, if anyone watching this

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.280 align:middle line:84%
has experienced that,
where you think,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't want to
call in anything.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to call
in the evil forces.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The intention, the feelings you
have, really are everything.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And I agree.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right on.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: You're
missing out on 98%.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.291 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because, again, being

00:44:59.291 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:84%
very specific, optimistic,
and expecting an outcome,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is a really big
part, is the expectation

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.360 align:middle line:84%
of the outcome, you're not going
to be drawing the other in.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're super
clairvoyant and sensitive,

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and you happen to be aware of
other entities, separate issue.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
There will be beings who
will come and be trying

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to get your attention,
tap you on the shoulder,

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
maybe even persuade you,
maybe even surf along and have

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.931 align:middle line:90%
a drink with you.

00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:25.820 align:middle line:84%
If you've gotten into
some bad habits--

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:26.320 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: That has
never been my experience.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not your experience.

00:45:28.995 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Never
been my experience.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:30.776 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:30.776 --> 00:45:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And actually, it's not mine.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I can see other beings,
but that doesn't

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.889 align:middle line:90%
mean they're there to harm me.

00:45:35.889 --> 00:45:38.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they're
influencing me negatively,

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.596 align:middle line:84%
but I just wanted to bring
that in because some people are

00:45:40.596 --> 00:45:43.829 align:middle line:84%
afraid of engaging
invisible forces,

00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:90%
because they could be negative.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.574 align:middle line:10%
But if you're not already
really bent that way,

00:45:47.574 --> 00:45:49.740 align:middle line:10%
that's not what's going to
resonate with you at all.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: And furthermore,
I will say this.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.940 align:middle line:10%
That this is a gift
to you of grace.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.370 align:middle line:10%
That, as I said before, this
is nothing that you can earn.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:02.330 align:middle line:10%
This is simply a gift to you
because you are a creator.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:06.270 align:middle line:10%
And because it is a gift,
how can you honor that?

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.090 align:middle line:10%
The best way you can
honor it is to use it.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:13.160 align:middle line:10%
If you don't call upon
this vast resource

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.860 align:middle line:10%
and bring that to use
in your everyday life

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:21.610 align:middle line:10%
to create joy, and happiness,
and fulfillment in your life,

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:23.930 align:middle line:10%
if you don't use
that, you're not

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.110 align:middle line:10%
honoring this very,
very precious gift

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.324 align:middle line:10%
that's been given to you
simply because you're alive.

00:46:28.324 --> 00:46:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, and
you're negating it.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.156 align:middle line:10%
You're not just not honoring
it, you're negating it.

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And by actually taking the
time to write some of it

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:84%
down, for example, and
say, asked for this,

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.480 align:middle line:84%
this is what happened,
you're starting

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce a sense a
very deep communication

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and trust within your own being.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you can foster
that, then we're

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
looking at now going
into a higher purpose.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know in your
workshops, you often

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.760 align:middle line:84%
work on the subject
of connecting

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:84%
with this for finding your,
really, your mission in life

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.870 align:middle line:90%
or your darma in life.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go into
trust in order to do that.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: And that's the thing.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.870 align:middle line:10%
As I've worked with
this, it really

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.400 align:middle line:10%
has rocked my world
in an amazing way,

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.720 align:middle line:10%
and it's totally
changed how I view life.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:19.060 align:middle line:10%
And the first big major epiphany
was that we are a creator,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:10%
and that we are divinely
sanctioned to be creators.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:28.020 align:middle line:10%
And the second big epiphany
was that not only is

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.510 align:middle line:10%
this entire celestial realm here
to assist me and my creation,

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:38.620 align:middle line:10%
but there's also something
that they're hiring me to do.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:10%
It's as if I have a job, and
they can see my unique light,

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:10%
and say, OK, we have Jean
to do this particular job.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here to talk
about getting everybody

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:10%
to hire the angels.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.170 align:middle line:10%
That's my job.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:10%
That's what I'm here to do.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing
is, if each one of us

00:47:57.445 --> 00:47:59.360 align:middle line:84%
is paying attention,
we know when

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.850 align:middle line:84%
we're begging for that
job, because we really

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:02.800 align:middle line:90%
need the money.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.440 align:middle line:84%
We know inside if
we're really listening.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We know that, no,
this isn't being

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:90%
done for the correct reasons.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And it takes
courage and maturity

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to utilize this in
a way that is productive for us

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:90%
on a day in day out basis.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:21.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't go begging at
the alter of anything

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.232 align:middle line:84%
and expect that you're
going to get help.

00:48:23.232 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone out
there listening

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
who is uncertain about what
their mission or their purpose

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.690 align:middle line:84%
in life is about,
then I suggest to them

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:84%
to put together a life
purpose committee.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.460 align:middle line:10%
And ask the members
of this committee

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:10%
to tap them on the shoulder and
to begin to highlight for them

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.370 align:middle line:10%
of what their
purpose is and begin

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.360 align:middle line:10%
to bring to their attention what
their gifts and talents are,

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.280 align:middle line:10%
and how that can be of
service to the world.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.665 align:middle line:10%
And what it is that their unique
light can bring to the world.

00:48:58.665 --> 00:48:59.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.020 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a great idea.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.760 align:middle line:10%
And now, a couple of
areas we didn't get into,

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.560 align:middle line:10%
which there are three
of them, actually.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.592 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, if they
can't get through to you,

00:49:08.592 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:84%
maybe they'll get through to
your neighbor, or your friend,

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.502 align:middle line:84%
or your spouse, or child,
and get the message

00:49:13.502 --> 00:49:14.210 align:middle line:90%
through that way.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they'll work
with other people around us

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:20.087 align:middle line:84%
if we're particularly distracted
or not paying attention.

00:49:20.087 --> 00:49:21.670 align:middle line:84%
You have a couple
of examples of that.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Just maybe give us one good one.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Well,
I have often seen

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:10%
messages delivered to
me from other people.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:35.100 align:middle line:10%
And I think probably
my favorite story

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.260 align:middle line:10%
about that was when I was
given the message that I

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.130 align:middle line:10%
needed to write this as a book.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.190 align:middle line:10%
So I immediately put together
a book writing committee,

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.672 align:middle line:10%
and I said, oh
gosh, you're going

00:49:44.672 --> 00:49:45.880 align:middle line:10%
to have to help me with this.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.650 align:middle line:10%
I have no idea how to
even begin writing.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.090 align:middle line:10%
This is not my forte.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.300 align:middle line:10%
This is not my business.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:10%
What do I do?

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.170 align:middle line:10%
Help me develop this.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:59.710 align:middle line:10%
And I received a phone call the
very next day on my answering

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:10%
machine from a perfect
stranger who said,

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:04.482 align:middle line:10%
hi, my name is so and so, and
I'm a developmental editor,

00:50:04.482 --> 00:50:05.940 align:middle line:10%
and I was just
wondering if you had

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:10%
any book projects
you were working on?

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, you
can't make this stuff up.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So, the message
got through to her.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.758 align:middle line:90%
And this happens.

00:50:15.758 --> 00:50:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I find this a lot where I'm
thinking about something,

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm contemplating
something, and then

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe later that day,
someone comes up to me

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and says something that is
the exact thing I was thinking

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
about and helps me
put it in perspective.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:90%
So that happens.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
we have crossovers.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.060 align:middle line:84%
For me, it happens a
lot in this crossover

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.590 align:middle line:84%
time between dream
and wakefulness.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Dream time and wakefulness,
I'll hear things.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll be given very specific
kinds of messages, for example.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I receive wonderful
messages in my dreams.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So much so that it's as
if the dreams-- I even

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.800 align:middle line:84%
see myself sleeping in my dreams
as almost I'm a third person.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.864 align:middle line:84%
And I will communicate to myself
like it's me talking to me.

00:51:02.864 --> 00:51:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yeah.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
telling me things.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
another way that my angels will

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.570 align:middle line:84%
get to me is through
my dreams, and they'll

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.030 align:middle line:90%
give me those messages.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.480 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not clueing in
on what's going on,

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.430 align:middle line:84%
they'll give it to me in
a dream very directly.

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
another thing that, I think,

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.270 align:middle line:84%
where journaling can be
particularly important.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed
Robert Moss, who

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.050 align:middle line:84%
has written some beautiful
books on dream time.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying
that if you actually

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.075 align:middle line:84%
start listening to what is being
given to you during dream time,

00:51:36.075 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and you start writing it
down, then what happens again,

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.060 align:middle line:90%
this same thing comes back.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You start strengthening
the relationship

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.080 align:middle line:84%
with that aspect of your
being, or the beings

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's right.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing
is you said, you listen.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: You listen.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.070 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: And how many
times have we had it,

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:55.700 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we've talked about
this, where we do get a message

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.629 align:middle line:10%
and we don't listen.

00:51:58.629 --> 00:51:59.170 align:middle line:90%
That happens.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:00.878 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I stopped
that a long time ago.

00:52:00.878 --> 00:52:05.030 align:middle line:84%
No, no, Scott, my husband is--
I mean, one of them a few years

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:08.890 align:middle line:84%
ago, I woke up and I heard,
"You need to sell your house.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:09.437 align:middle line:90%
Do it now.

00:52:09.437 --> 00:52:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Put your For Sale
sign in the ground."

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And this was my beloved home in
Sedona, my community, my heart

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.180 align:middle line:84%
community of friends
that I adored.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's, no, no, no.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And but it was very clear.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.690 align:middle line:84%
You're to do this, and
you're to sell it now.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened is, because
we had started our company

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Conscious Media Network, it
took all our money and resources

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:30.640 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was at a time, really,
we had to make a change,

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:36.130 align:middle line:84%
but I would have hung in
there until we probably

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.270 align:middle line:90%
lost the house.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is,
preemptively, my guide

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.770 align:middle line:90%
said do this thing now.

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So it gave me just enough
months to do a little work

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.770 align:middle line:84%
on the house, hire an agent,
get the agent out there.

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, she sold
it at literally the top

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.820 align:middle line:84%
of the market,
because within weeks

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that's when the housing
bubble happened.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And the prices started tumbling.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Everybody should
have a spiritual financial

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.240 align:middle line:90%
committee.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.614 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
prices tumbled,

00:53:06.614 --> 00:53:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and we got out of it
OK in the nick of time.

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Had I not been given that
message at that time,

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and been willing to listen
to it in spite of the fact,

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.890 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, I did not
want to hear that message,

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I just learned
don't mess with it.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.861 align:middle line:84%
When it comes through loud and
clear, you don't mess with it.

00:53:20.861 --> 00:53:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Same thing
happened to me prior to 2008.

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:26.280 align:middle line:10%
I got a message from my
spiritual financial committee

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.010 align:middle line:10%
to remove all of
my money where I

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:32.370 align:middle line:10%
had it invested in my IRA
over to another account

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.730 align:middle line:10%
guaranteed return.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.650 align:middle line:10%
And I did that.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I got the message
move everything,

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:43.910 align:middle line:84%
don't even diversify,
just move everything.

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.976 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after I did,
the market plummeted.

00:53:46.976 --> 00:53:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I mean, I think
a lot of people listening

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to this right now
might think that,

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.990 align:middle line:84%
oh, well that's
great for you guys.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:middle line:84%
No, this is something
that happened for me

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.790 align:middle line:84%
one thing at a time, where I
thought, hey, wait a minute.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I asked for help, and
I actually got it.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn to-- because
I can be pretty left-brain.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn to have
confidence in that the same

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:08.847 align:middle line:90%
as you did.

00:54:08.847 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, that's obviously
why I resonated so strongly

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:11.950 align:middle line:90%
through your book.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And even so, as I
said earlier, I still

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.012 align:middle line:90%
wasn't using it all the time.

00:54:15.012 --> 00:54:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
this is actually

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.350 align:middle line:84%
a relationship as very real as
the other people in your life.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
drop the ball on it,

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.480 align:middle line:84%
or you're not going
to get anything.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to
bring up one more thing,

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:28.660 align:middle line:84%
because this is
important, and we've only

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:84%
got a couple of
minutes left here.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is you
mentioned dousing earlier

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.500 align:middle line:84%
with your clientele
as a naturopath.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You use dousing to be able
to tap into their field

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.792 align:middle line:84%
and allow their guides
to work with you.

00:54:40.792 --> 00:54:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell you
what that body is needing.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And let's just-- we only have
maybe three or four minutes.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about dousing.

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Well, dousing--

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.848 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because it's
another interface.

00:54:51.848 --> 00:54:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yes,
using a pendulum,

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.030 align:middle line:10%
some sort of divination tool.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:55:00.390 align:middle line:10%
So what I do is when I'm in
an area that I'm unfamiliar,

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.940 align:middle line:10%
like say I want to
ask a legal question,

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.520 align:middle line:10%
then I'll hire a
spiritual lawyer

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.880 align:middle line:10%
to answer through my pendulum.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.990 align:middle line:10%
Or if I'm working with
a client, I always

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:15.300 align:middle line:10%
connect in with my spiritual
physician to work through me

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.900 align:middle line:10%
and answer through my pendulum.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Or if I am working with
somebody doing life coaching,

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.737 align:middle line:10%
then I hire my
spiritual life coach.

00:55:22.737 --> 00:55:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I bring this
up, because some people don't

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:84%
feel comfortable
with the notion you

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:27.589 align:middle line:84%
may have to wait
and hear something.

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
are clairaudient,

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:34.280 align:middle line:84%
other people are visual, others
you work very well with all

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of the common divination
devices, a pendulum being one.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.274 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
dousing for water.

00:55:40.274 --> 00:55:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been
used throughout history.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:43.820 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing but the same thing.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Connecting with an
energetic matrix

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to
feed back energy.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this
up, because there

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.150 align:middle line:84%
may be some of you who
have a little pendulum

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.360 align:middle line:84%
someone gave you long ago
that's sitting around.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.609 align:middle line:84%
And through this you can
also connect with these guys.

00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And talk to
your heavenly hires.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So when
you, say you've

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.160 align:middle line:84%
hired them to take care of a
party that you're putting on,

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.940 align:middle line:84%
then you could ask
with your pendulum, OK,

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.580 align:middle line:90%
have we got the guest list OK?

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Have we got the food ordered?

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:12.207 align:middle line:90%
Is everything in order?

00:56:12.207 --> 00:56:14.665 align:middle line:84%
And you could use your pendulum
to just kind of communicate

00:56:14.665 --> 00:56:16.000 align:middle line:90%
and check in.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I find
that particularly useful.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that in all my
years doing the work that I do,

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.110 align:middle line:90%
I will check in.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:84%
I check in before
almost every interview.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare that I
don't check in on someone.

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:30.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times there might
be someone really famous,

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and they would like to be
interviewed, someone well

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:36.592 align:middle line:84%
known, and I get-- no, I'm
getting a no on that one.

00:56:36.592 --> 00:56:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I won't do it, and
I think, God, that's silly.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the person's popular.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And then someone
completely unknown,

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:44.760 align:middle line:84%
a quirky little
subject, and I'll

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.280 align:middle line:90%
get a big hit, a yes on it.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So even for the
work I do, I always

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.940 align:middle line:84%
check in on an
intuitive level first.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's, again, my
higher self giving me

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.320 align:middle line:84%
the info, guides,
it doesn't matter.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So far, cross fingers,
it's worked really well.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:01.610 align:middle line:84%
We have just a few
seconds left, Jean.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you so
much for being with us today.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.001 align:middle line:84%
I know this is like a big
rah-rah thing, and lots

00:57:06.001 --> 00:57:07.760 align:middle line:84%
of little stories,
but this is probably

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the most critical
things we can ever do.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.003 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I'll tell
you what, if you're not

00:57:12.003 --> 00:57:14.310 align:middle line:84%
"Hiring the Heavens," life
is harder than it has to be.

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:15.893 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you, and as you

00:57:15.893 --> 00:57:18.610 align:middle line:84%
may have gathered by now, we
use this on a daily basis.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I can tell
you with certainty

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:25.450 align:middle line:84%
that your life will definitely
flow more smoothly as ours do.

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I urge you,
pick up a copy of Jean's book

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and start using it.

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.129 align:middle line:84%
Use your unseen friends, your
higher self, because it works.

00:57:33.129 --> 00:57:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And you might want to even
pass it on to friends.

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.785 align:middle line:90%
at Gaiam TV.

00:57:40.785 --> 00:57:43.730 align:middle line:90%
