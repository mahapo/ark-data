00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>This chapter is
called "Blue Pearls

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:84%
from the Kingdom
of Light" because,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%
according to the Gnostic
systems, that's what we are.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Who we are and what is
perfected, according

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Gnostics
and the alchemists,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
as well-- they describe us as a
solar drop, an immortal pearl,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
an indestructible
drop-- a seed atom

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that is perceived by some
as a drop of molten gold

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:90%
or, in fact, stardust.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Inner Light.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.485 align:middle line:84%
And what the Gnostics teach
and what the alchemists teach

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is that this seed
atom-- this solar drop--

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
is who we truly
are, and it is what

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
grows the vehicles
necessary for incarnation.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Although the various Gnostic
cosmogonies differ slightly

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
in details, they all talk
about this realm of light

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:84%
that we came from and that
our divine spark is presently

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
in this world of darkness
which doesn't necessarily

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:90%
mean a bad place.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's not
the realm of the light.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want to
recognize here is that within us

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
is-- for some of us, maybe--
an unknown part of ourself--

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:90%
our true self.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I asked Mr. Dana
Augustine to come up

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
with this depiction
here of the true self--

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.666 align:middle line:84%
of the Inner Light--
of the divine spark,

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
we came up with.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.436 align:middle line:84%
And there are
other various names

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%
for this transcendent self.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called our luminous
nature, the living

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:90%
self, the luminous self.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:90%
It's also called mana as well.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at
these images, just

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
try to place that
within your own body.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.485 align:middle line:84%
Try to connect with that
divine spark within you.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:90%
See if you can feel it.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It's called the spirit in
us, the inner man, the spark,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
the seed of light.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can see there
are numerous names

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:90%
for this aspect of ourselves.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's no exaggeration
to say that the discovery

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
of this transcendent
inner self in man

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
is the supreme concern
of the Gnostics.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And their primary focus
was on the well-being

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of this aspect of
ourselves and the awakening

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:90%
of this aspect of ourselves.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
This seed is thought of as
a kernel of immortality.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.294 align:middle line:84%
It's, sort of, an
egg or an embryo.

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And it might even be
compared to the chrysalis

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
or the cocoon that
transforms into a butterfly.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:84%
A kernel is what is
innermost or hidden.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at-- well,
I just put a picture of me

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:90%
up there, for example.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we think of ourselves
as this is all there is.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But what the Gnostics
wanted us to consider

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
is that within us is this divine
spark-- this seed-- that it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:90%
represents who we truly are.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
In effect, our
bodies and our brains

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
are a device created by this
divine spark as a vehicle.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Our body, in this case, becomes
an information gathering

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
system-- an instrument,
if you will.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It's an earthly
transportation vehicle

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:90%
for this aspect of ourselves.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And, as we've talked
earlier, our culture

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.707 align:middle line:84%
tells us that this is all
there is-- that the flesh

00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and blood is what we want to
be concerned about in terms

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:90%
of perfecting-- not so.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics-- the
alchemists taught

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that our body is a human,
biological, transformational

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:90%
apparatus.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I call it a stargate.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is from our divine
spark's perspective

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that we grow this body, and
we utilize it as a gateway

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
or, in fact, as a
stairway to heaven.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Luz is the Hebrew name
given for this divine spark.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Luz is also the Hebrew
word for almond.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
When Jacob had his experience
with the ladder that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.145 align:middle line:84%
reached into the heavens, it
was at a place called Luz.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
It also happens to be the
Spanish word for light.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
The Maya said that this
almond-shaped graphic--

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
this vesica-shaped
graphic form--

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:90%
represented the Milky Way.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They also said it relates to the
cosmic egg or the cosmic seed

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.632 align:middle line:90%
from which springs all life.

00:04:07.632 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that in
these various traditions

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
this idea of the
seed atom is present.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
When we look at these
transfiguration images

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.774 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, we see him in
that almond-shaped gateway--

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that vesica gateway-- that's
completely covered with stars

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:90%
or composed of stars.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We would have to ask if that
is, in fact, the representation

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
of the seed atom.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And what Jesus is doing
is showing the great work

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're all involved in which
is awakening that seed atom,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and perfecting it, and
utilizing it as a gateway

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.949 align:middle line:90%
to travel between realms.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.365 align:middle line:84%
You see this at
Chartres Cathedral

00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:45.185 align:middle line:90%
where Jesus is in the vesica.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, now what we
know is that that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:84%
is a actual symbol
for our divine

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:90%
spark-- our divine particle.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Same thing here with this
transfiguration image--

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
we see the exact same
vesica-shaped symbol.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a Kabbalistic
depiction of the crucifixion--

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
very important because we have
the traditional crucifixion

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.909 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But then we have the
esoteric version of it

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
here with each point on his
body corresponding to one

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of the branches on
the tree of life.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, when
we learn to activate

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that inner tree of life, it
opens up that gateway for us

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:90%
to open into other dimensions.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians called it
the field of the blessed

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:90%
or the realm of the blessed.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So quick meditation--
sitting with your eyes

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.789 align:middle line:90%
closed, if you like.

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a deep breath.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.945 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:10%
And just for a moment
imagine that your body

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:10%
is made of translucent material
and see inside your body.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:10%
Locate your divine spark.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.144 align:middle line:10%
Now, look into the future
and see your body change.

00:06:05.144 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:10%
And notice that your divine
spark remains the same.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
See your divine spark
glowing from within.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.595 align:middle line:90%
Connect with it.

00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Now go many, many
years into the future

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and see your body change, and
see that your divine spark

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:90%
remains the same.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, open an almond-shaped
or vesica-shaped doorway

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
around your body and
notice your divine spark.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And now, whenever you're
ready, open your eyes

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and notice the divine spark
within the person beside you.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Very simple meditation
but the idea

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:84%
is just to connect with that
divine spark and recognize

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that we look at the
flesh and the cover here,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.516 align:middle line:84%
but we don't look to
what's on the inside.

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:21.175 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we all truly share,

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in addition to our humanity, is
that we are all divine sparks

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:90%
that came here from elsewhere.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we're learning to
do is to activate this body

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:90%
so that we can continue.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what's called the
heart craft by the alchemists.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
They believed it all took
place inside the heart.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Key quote here comes
from William Blake

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
who said that "man
is all imagination.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The eternal body of
man is the imagination,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:90%
that is, God himself."

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we talked earlier
about the light body

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
as being made of
supramental substance.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a really key
point here that Blake

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.864 align:middle line:84%
is making-- is that
everything is imagination.

00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And the work that
we're perfecting

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
or the work that we're doing is
reflecting on our imagination--

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, using the
energy of the heart

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
in order to transmute
our body into light.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
This is Jacob, once again,
who's asleep on the stone.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And he falls into
a dream-- imagines

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that he sees a ladder
reaching into the heavens.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
He scales that ladder
going through the sun

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to a higher fire place,
comes back around,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and recognizes that he's
not in the heavenly world.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
What Jacob learned-- and he
became one of the earliest

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
perfected humans-- is the
power of the imagination

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
the heart together.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I often will cite this
example as-- to me--

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:90%
as the lesson of earth life.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:90%
This is why we are all here.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
This is what we are
all here to learn.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
This looks like a simple
three-dimensional cube.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But what it really
is is 12 lines

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that are projected onto the
screen that are brought to life

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:90%
in your imagination as a cube.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And the idea here is that if
this three-dimensional cube is

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.110 align:middle line:84%
12 lines that are
projected on a screen

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and brought to life in
our imagination, then

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a good possibility
that this remote control is

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
something different than
it first appears to be.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.302 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a
collection of plastic.

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:90%
There's some ink.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
There's some metal here--
all comes together--

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:90%
feels like it's solid.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I click it, and I can go back
and forth between images.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, what a physics
teacher would tell us

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
this really is is
energy in motion.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.565 align:middle line:90%
It's atoms.

00:09:42.565 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It's molecules
that's all brought

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.309 align:middle line:90%
to life in our imagination.

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:49.725 align:middle line:84%
What's important about this
cube is that if this is true--

00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and I believe this is
true-- this cube shows us

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that we always have a choice in
how we're going to view things

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
out here because we can look at
this cube from one perspective,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
we're looking into it.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But now, if we shift
our perspective,

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we're
looking down into the cube

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and a completely
different box appears.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you all make
it shift or jump?

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it shifts and
jumps uncontrollably,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
but the idea is we can
control this with our choice.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The reason I say that this
is the lesson of earth life

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
is because every instant in our
life, every encounter we have,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is brought to life
in our imagination

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:90%
just like this cube.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And in every encounter,
every moment of our life,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
we have a choice
about what we're

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:90%
going to do in that situation.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
We can either put fear
into the situation,

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
or we can put love
into the situation.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two
choices that we have.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Based upon your choice, that
determines your experience here

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.565 align:middle line:84%
Universal law, in
fact, says what

00:10:56.565 --> 00:10:59.607 align:middle line:90%
we put out is what we get back.

00:10:59.607 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Sounds very simple
but, again, I think

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
this is the whole
lesson of earth life.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.952 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
We are here to learn to
control our emotions.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
We are here to learn to
control our imagination.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is that if we
continue to be beings of fear--

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I think there are higher
beings in our universe

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that want to keep us, kind of,
contained on this prison planet

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.779 align:middle line:84%
so long as we're
basically out of control

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want fear
out in the rest of the universe.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.986 align:middle line:84%
What they're interested
in is what we're

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:84%
really interested in here-- is
to flip our consciousness here

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:90%
out of fear into love.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why our time is so
important right now because you

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:84%
can take out the old
term fear down here

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:90%
and put in the word terror.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
You can take out the
word love up here

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.262 align:middle line:90%
and put in the word tara.

00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
It's flip side.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Tara is the Buddhist word for
compassion and enlightenment.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I like to joke that when the
present administration launched

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:84%
the war on terror, they
started proclaiming that we're

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.887 align:middle line:90%
winning the war on tara.

00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And I would just have to listen.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.252 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying?

00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And the president would say,
we're winning the war on tara.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.168 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's trying to sound
like John Wayne or something

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and just never really
enunciated his words properly.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Because my point is
that if he meant to say

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.080 align:middle line:84%
we're winning the war on
terror, he should properly

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:90%
pronounce that word.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when he's saying
we're winning the war on tara.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like the war is on
compassion and enlightenment

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty scary.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that's
actually what it is.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:90%
We're winning the war on terror.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we are overcoming
terror in our world.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, you can't
fight terror with more terror.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:90%
It's totally illogical.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend-- we've
spent a trillion dollars

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
already fighting a war on
terror-- a trillion dollars.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we had taken
that same trillion dollars--

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
that's with a T--
and invested it

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
in compassionate and
enlightening producing

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
technologies,
concepts, programs.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Our world would be a
completely different place.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.299 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
confronted with right here.

00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi tell us that only
love can exist in our hearts

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
during this time as we
approach the balance.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're not in
love or in a love zone,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
there's a recycling
program that's awaiting us,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.539 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
imminent as well.

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Not that they're going to
flush the entire planet

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
down the tubes, but
those who inhabit

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the planet will
have to make different choices

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.876 align:middle line:90%
if they expect to survive.

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're
confronted with right here

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in these very important
times-- is recognizing we all

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.696 align:middle line:84%
have a choice in how we're going
to perceive things out here.

00:13:44.696 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for us to
collectively get more

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
into the love zone rather than
the fear zone or the terror

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:90%
zone.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
The promise here is
that if we can do that,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
our three-dimensional
cube now becomes

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
the center of a
fourth-dimensional hypercube.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
If we can flip our
civilization into one

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
based on compassion
and enlightenment,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:11.357 align:middle line:84%
that's when the gateways open
into other dimensional realms.

00:14:11.357 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I think we're
going to largely be closed off

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the
universe because they

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
don't want a bunch of fear
mongers out in the universe.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.711 align:middle line:84%
They don't want a
bunch of terrorists

00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
running around the
universe wreaking havoc.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Richard Leviton writes about
stargates and earth portals.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.680 align:middle line:84%
He defines the land of
milk and honey in this way.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:10%
He says, "the land is
the fifth dimension

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:10%
where the stargates
on earth are found.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:10%
The flowing that comes
from the promised land

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:10%
is the rain of gold
and yellow light

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:10%
from above when the
stargate is turned on.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And the milk is the
brightness of the stargate.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And the honey is the golden
yellow rain from above."

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about other
dimensional substances here.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about in the light
body-- a supramental substance,

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and becoming ultra
humans, and being

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:84%
able to reach into
these other realms.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And the promise here is
that if we can do this,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that there are higher
energies that we can then

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
bring into our world that will
massively shift this place.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
do that, we've got

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.366 align:middle line:90%
to give up the war on terror.

00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
We just can't win
a war on terror.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Terror only creates more terror.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to begin to bring about
some enlightenment-based and

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
compassionate-based
technologies.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And it goes beyond
being green, too.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, green is
more than just recycling.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Green is truly a civilization
focused on other dimensions.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Green is a civilization focused
on regeneration, rebirth,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:90%
renewal.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It's even based
on reincarnation.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Christianity does not
accept reincarnation.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Henceforth, it's OK to trash
this place because you're not

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.066 align:middle line:90%
coming back here.

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:52.145 align:middle line:84%
But if you believe in
reincarnation and regeneration,

00:15:52.145 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take
care of this place

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
because you know you're
coming back here.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'd rather be in
a garden rather than

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:90%
a trash dump-- that's for sure.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:90%
This is how we ascend.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:90%
This is how we raise up.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:90%
This is how we elevate.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
This is also how we break
free and, ultimately,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
how we flash forth
out of this quagmire

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.837 align:middle line:84%
that you might just define
Western civilization as.

00:16:14.837 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the challenge that
each of us have right now.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And it gets mighty
challenging when

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
you turn on the
news every night,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and all it's talking about
is destruction and terror.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's even a political
litmus test today.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
If you don't believe in the war
on terror, you're a terrorist.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.672 align:middle line:90%
I learned that Sean Hannity.

00:16:33.672 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I was watching him one night.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going to
interview a high school

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.612 align:middle line:84%
student who couldn't write
the word God in his yearbook.

00:16:41.612 --> 00:16:42.416 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:90%
It sounded outrageous.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So I said, oh, I'll
listen to this.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So they bring this kid on.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Turns out it wasn't
the word God that he

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
wanted to put in his
high school yearbook.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It was the words Jesus Christ.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And right then I finally got it.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I was never raised in
a Christian household.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that they
think Jesus Christ is God.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really get that
until watching this program.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And as Sean developed this
conversation with this kid,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
he said, so you couldn't write
Jesus Christ in your yearbook.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.699 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because terrorists
don't believe in God.

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, so that means if you don't
believe that Jesus Christ is

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:90%
God, you're a terrorist.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And further, what that means
is that the war on terror

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
is actually against you.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The war on terror
is not against some

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.694 align:middle line:84%
ne'er-do-wells in Afghanistan
barely out of a cave.

00:17:35.694 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a total joke.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The terrorists are people who
don't believe in Jesus Christ.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate definition
of the war on terror.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is coming
to our awareness right now--

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:90%
is that it's being amplified.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
points that Naomi Wolf

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
made the other day-- is that
the current administration has

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
redefined the war on terror
to not just be against those

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:90%
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
The war on terror is a
global war on terror.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And terrorists are
anybody who does not

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:90%
believe in Jesus Christ.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.845 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the end of the world.

00:18:08.845 --> 00:18:09.344 align:middle line:90%
