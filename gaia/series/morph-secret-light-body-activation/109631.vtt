[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:10.562 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's get back to what
we're really all about here.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.760 align:middle line:90%
North for us is the son door.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Opening the son door.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was called the son.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:90%
He was called the door.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why, and we've
just explained why that is.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Because he is the way,
the truth, and the light.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:84%
The way to the heavens
is through the son

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that
our transfiguration is

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
the way that we're going to
be able to access these gates.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the reason why I think
that we have Moses and Elijah

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.239 align:middle line:84%
on either side of
Jesus and the gate

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
is because that's exactly
the way the ancient Egyptians

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
portrayed this gate-- the
two lions of yesterday

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:90%
and tomorrow.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Moses represents
the Old Testament.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Moses here, excuse me, and
Elijah ultimately represents

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
the new, because he reincarnates
as John the Baptist.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday and
tomorrow, they're sort

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of bookends that open
the gateway of the sun.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But again, the way
we get to heaven

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.527 align:middle line:90%
is through a wormhole today.

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
That's ultimately
what we're learning.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was at the
temple of Esna in Egypt

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and took some pictures of
these phenomenal columns.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And you might think
I'm seeing things here.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Just take this for
what it's worth.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.436 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit of
entertainment here.

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:19.405 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
looking at these columns,

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking, wow,
those look like the mouths

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:90%
of wormholes to me.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Here's the mouth of a wormhole.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And here's the top of
the column at Esna.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, wow, you know,
that shape is really profound.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They're lotuses, typically,
but it also represents in a way

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:90%
the open mouth of a wormhole.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Got the tree of life at
the end of this one here.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
This is Esna.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, what
really opened my mind

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to this line of speculation
here is that, once again,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
when you look on
the ceiling at Esna,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and these columns open up in
their wormhole shape, what

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
you actually see on these
temple-- on the ceiling

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of this temple is,
once again, the gods

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
in their ships of
eternity, their ark

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:90%
of the millions of years.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you
would have the opening

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
of the mouth of a wormhole
into the starry realm,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:84%
where all the gods are portrayed
on their wormhole-shaped craft

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
sailing into eternity
as light beings.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the ultimate
quest that we are all on,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to awaken
our consciousness

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
this is our destiny.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Something very important here,
when we go back just an image

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
here, are the two awakened
guys with the wormhole craft.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Very important symbolism to me.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I recently interviewed
on the radio show

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I co-host, "Dreamland," I
interviewed Dr. Michio Kaku.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of like
the new Carl Sagan.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
He's a physicist and
kind of is one that says,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
this is what's possible,
this is what's not possible.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.936 align:middle line:84%
And it was Dr. Kaku
who said that he dug up

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
some Russian
research that talked

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
about various levels of
civilization-- type 0, type

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
1, and type 2, type 3 are
the levels assigned to these.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
A type 0 civilization
is what we are.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
We cannibalize the
resources of our planet.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
We're at war with one another.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We have just recently discovered
the secrets of nuclear power.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
If we're lucky, we're going to
become a type 1 civilization.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
A type 1 civilization
is one that

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
has harnessed the power
of its local star,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
uses that as its power source
instead of old dinosaurs.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It colonizes its solar system.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
It has solved all of
its economic problems.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is becoming more of a
global civilization, something

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are
resisting right now.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a type 1 civilization.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Kaku says,
if we're lucky,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
we're about 1,000
years away from that.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
A type 2 civilization
is one that

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
has harnessed the
power of the black hole

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:90%
at the center of its galaxy.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a galactic
based civilization.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
A type 3 is beyond
our imagination.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
He says that a type
3 ultimately is

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
a wormhole-travelling
civilization.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I think, if I'm
correct here in saying

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Egyptian gods--
these light beings that came

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt and built the pyramid
as a resurrection machine

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.749 align:middle line:84%
and left us this
wormhole imagery-- are,

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
in fact, a true
civilization, they're

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:90%
at least a type 2 civilization.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kaku says we're a
million years away from that.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.262 align:middle line:90%
A million years away.

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:90%
That give you encouragement?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just a million years.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
In eternity, that's
nothing, right?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But my take is, hey,
I think if we're

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
able to interpret this
symbolism left by these beings,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
we must be a heck of
a lot closer to being

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
able to duplicate what
we see on these walls

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
than has heretofore
been expected.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we're real
close to this.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why our world is
in such turmoil right now.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.107 align:middle line:90%
We really are metamorphosing.

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We're getting out
of this pupal stage,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
where we're slaves to some
master, be it a credit card

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
or a president or a
religious ideology.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer
going to be slaves.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's kind of the
way that Joseph Campbell talks

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
about this too, is that
you have various degrees

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:90%
of civilizations.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.392 align:middle line:84%
The most primitive is a
master to slave, civilization.

00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
want to get away from,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
where we're all slaves
to a particular deity

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
or a religious or
political ideology.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
What we want to
get to is the level

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus and the
disciples enjoyed.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.686 align:middle line:90%
They were friends.

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:90%
They fished together.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
They hung out together.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.675 align:middle line:84%
There was no master-slave
relationship with them.

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They were like,
hey, Jesus, let's

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
go have a beer, glass
of wine, whatever.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually, their sacrament
was marijuana and red wine.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.776 align:middle line:84%
But that's a whole
'nother lecture.

00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and the sacred
mushrooms too.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They did a lot of mushrooms
together, as well.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So they want to become
friends together.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Another relationship
that they wanted to enjoy

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
is the relationship
that Mary and Jesus

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
enjoyed, mother to son.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
the Green Revolution.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to be
slaves to our planet.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to enslave
our planet either,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:90%
which is what we've been doing.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to be maybe
friends with our planet,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
but we want to enjoy the
mother and child relationship.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Our planet is our mother.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're the children
of this planet.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree that we treat
our planet like our mother,

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to enjoy
a lot of prosperity.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
If we treat our mother-- we
call our mother a whore or just

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.575 align:middle line:84%
think that she's some
piece of crap or whatever

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and we can do whatever we want,
and going green and all that

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is a stupid idea,
you know, we're

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
just going to continue
back on the master to slave

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be enslaved
by people and ideologies.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, what we
want is a relationship

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
that we really can't even
imagine with the deity.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.615 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
relationship that I think

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the Ancient
Egyptians understood,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.906 align:middle line:84%
where we have the awakened
consciousness where

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
we recognize the
unity of all things,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.434 align:middle line:84%
that we can go from
star to star to star,

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that we are eternal
beings and that everything

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
we're doing here is just for
fun, and none of this is real.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.734 align:middle line:84%
Eternity is real,
and everything we're

00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
doing here and putting all our
time and energy and emotion

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
into is temporary.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's the message
that I take out

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.206 align:middle line:84%
of these incredible
Egyptian depictions.

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorites here.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got a son
god and a goddess.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:90%
They're dancing together.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
They're surfing on their
wormhole-shaped ships,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and their wormholes
are even intertwined.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Hey, maybe there's some, like,
cosmic switching station out

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
there, where these wormholes
criss-crossed maybe

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
dimensions or times or
going to other places.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:90%
But they're clearly dancing.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:90%
They're having a good time.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:90%
This is all about joy.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.647 align:middle line:84%
They're not
subservient to anybody.

00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:90%
They're not worshipping anybody.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:90%
They're having a good time.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
A real good time dancing
with one another.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Dancing like our
wormhole dancer here.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And it takes me back to when
Jesus transfigured himself

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
into light and
resurrects from the tomb.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And he comes out and tells
Mary Magdalene, don't touch me.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my light body
formed, don't touch me.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It's also, I'm dancing.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good time.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't touch me.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Can't touch this, right?

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But you get the point here that
what we're talking about here

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is the same imagery
over and over again.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But what's been omitted from
it is, one, you can do this.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You can do this, and you
better be doing this.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:90%
You better.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what you better
be focusing your life on

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
at some point, because
that is the only way you're

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.012 align:middle line:90%
going to get through that gate.

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's going to be
like walking through a blender.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.401 align:middle line:84%
You could get your
feathers ruffled.

00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to open a chapter here
called The Mission Statement.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:90%
The Mission Statement.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
"Cease not to seek day
and night and remit not

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
yourselves until you find
the purifying mysteries which

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
will purify you and make
you into a refined light,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
so that you will go
on height and inherit

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:90%
the light of my kingdom."

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Who said that?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said that to Mary
Magdalene in response

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to a question posed by
her in the Pistis Sophia.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get any clearer
than that to me about,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
this what we're
supposed to be doing.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Don't do anything "until
you find the purifying

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
mysteries which will
purify you and make you

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.369 align:middle line:84%
into a refined light, so
that you will go on height

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and inherit the
light of my kingdom."

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.451 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, I'm going
to share with you

00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:90%
the context of that quote.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and Mary Magdalene talking
about a group of beings called

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
archons that gnostic
scholars think

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.769 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the reptilians
or the greys in the UFO area.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
that what they're

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:84%
talking about as our body is
imprisoned on this planet, that

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
within it is this capability
to become a refined light,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.147 align:middle line:84%
to become pure,
to become perfect.

00:09:58.147 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as we're
going to see tomorrow,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the only way that you evade
these archons-- or rulers,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
as they're also called--
is to become perfect.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Until then, they're like
a predatory species.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
They're harvesting energy
from our body, especially

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.226 align:middle line:90%
fear energy.

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But that, again,
is for tomorrow.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
We want to stay on
this track right here

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of establishing that this
is what we are to be doing.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I was in Glastonbury,
England, back in the summer.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:10%
I took this photo of
Jesus and Mary Magdalene

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:10%
in the Church of John
the Baptist there.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just really liked
it, because it shows Jesus

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:90%
in a pretty typical fashion.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But it shows Mary
Magdalene as beautiful,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
wealthy, which is what she
was-- a woman of royal lineage.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
She's not shown as depressed
and dowdy and penitent

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in all the ways that the
traditional images are

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:90%
portrayed of for.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
What I especially liked about
this was the image of the sun

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
up here, is that
she's keeping her eye

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
on the sun and the
illumination of the sun.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics believed
that humanity

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:90%
came from a divine light world.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
They also said that envoys
are sent to Earth periodically

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
from a kingdom of light, as
they referred to it, in order

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to remind souls of the
knowledge of the light

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and to guide them on the path
of return back to the light.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Come along to give
us wake up calls

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and to give us this knowledge
that we need in order

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to return to our source, the
place where we came from.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
For many of these
envoys, they were

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:90%
considered magi or magicians.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:84%
As I said, Jesus and Mary
Magdalene, the other disciples,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
were part of an
esoteric research

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
group who were looking for this
very specific knowledge that

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
are referred to here as the
purifying mysteries that

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:90%
will turn you into light.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
This here is, in fact, one
of these other emissaries,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:84%
whose name is Simon the Magi
or Simon Magus, Simon Zelotes,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
who's also portrayed
at the Church of John

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:90%
the Baptist in Glastonbury.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
These guys were
perfected human beings.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:90%
They could walk on water.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They could perform
miraculous cures.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
They could raise the dead.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.149 align:middle line:84%
They could make
themselves invisible.

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
They possessed the keys
to the kingdom of heaven.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:90%
They were telepathic.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And they introduced
religious reforms

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.499 align:middle line:84%
about the mysteries of the light
and how to embody the light.

00:12:15.499 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And these are all the
things that you and I

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:90%
are capable of doing as well.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the magician is
one of my favorite topics.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I've gone to great
lengths to collect as many

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
of the early Christian
images of Jesus

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
as a magician with his
Harry Potter wand in hand

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:84%
here raising Lazarus
from the dead.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice he's in
this cocoon-like form,

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus is striking him right
there on the crown chakra,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
awakening his higher
consciousness, awakening him

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
from the dead into a living
being-- in other words,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%
a light being.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.525 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jesus with his
rod and ring in hand.

00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:10%
This is how they thought of them
in the earliest Christian art.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:00.639 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is portrayed with this
rod or wand and with this ring.

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, I'm going to talk
with you about the particle

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
accelerator at CERN, which
is a 17-mile-around ring

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
that scientists now say is
actually a teleportation

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.917 align:middle line:90%
device, a time travel machine.

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
There are two types of
particle accelerator.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's the rod
type, the linear type,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and the ring types.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I just find it very
interesting that Jesus

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
has, of all symbols, a rod
and a ring in his hand.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And today, we think of that
as a particle accelerator,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
a device that can
slice and dice matter

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and also is ultimately
used for opening stargates

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and wormholes.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Is that what this imagery
ultimately represents?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Is his mastery of the
secrets of matter?

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
He's riding up on
his white horse,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%
his winged white
horse, which is also

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
a symbol of ascended
consciousness.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:10%
Joseph of Arimathea is another
of these envoys, or emissaries,

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:10%
part of this research group.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:10%
Again, Arimathea did not exist
at the time of Jesus and Mary

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:10%
Magdalene.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:84%
What my friend and colleague,
Laurence Gardner, says,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Arimathea means as one who
knew the secrets of the craft.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
The craft-- alchemy, of how to
take lead, turn it into gold.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Take a body, turn it into light.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.659 align:middle line:84%
That's the craft that these
figures knew and practiced.

00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Glastonbury is a magical place.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.574 align:middle line:84%
You go there, you
got the Chalice Well,

00:14:17.574 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
where Joseph is said to
have brought the Holy Grail.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It's marked by this very
beautiful cover plate here.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Symbol of the Chalice Well.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Two interlocking
circles with the vesica

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
piscis symbol of the
doorway in between.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.694 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolic of the Taurus,
but it's also symbolic

00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:90%
of something very important.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the modern
scientific symbol

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
for quantum entanglement,
how particles or photons can

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
be two places at once and is one
of the key sciences opening up

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the whole Stargate
science of the ancients.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind of interesting
that you can just superimpose

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
the quantum entanglement
symbol over the Chalice Well

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
at Glastonbury Tor,
and you have it.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The Chalice Well is said to
represent the ultimate secrets

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:90%
of early Christianity.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
What if it is all
about entanglement?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:84%
What if it is all about these
guys being more like Einstein

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:90%
than anything else?

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:90%
They're Stephen Hawking types.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
Michio Kaku types.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.564 align:middle line:84%
These are high-energy
physics types.

00:15:17.564 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I've said before
that, if you want

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
to find the second coming
of Jesus and Mary Magdalene,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.516 align:middle line:84%
go to CERN, because that's
where they'd be hanging out.

00:15:26.516 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Wherever the high-energy
physics work's

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
being done on the planet, that's
where you would find them.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea of
entanglement explains

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the crucifixion
and the transfiguration.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.384 align:middle line:84%
How can Christ be
two places at once?

00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea is
that, once you've ever

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
come in contact with a photon,
you're always in contact

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:90%
with that photon.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if there was a
Christ-like being who

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
spoke transfigured himself
into light 2,000 years ago

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:84%
through the process
of entanglement,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we're still connected
to that energy

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:90%
and can still connect to it.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really remarkable.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
When Joseph came
to Glastonbury, he

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:84%
saw this artificially
tiered mound

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and said, hey, that reminds
me of Mount Tabor, where

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:84%
the transfiguration
of Jesus took place.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Glastonbury
became so important,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
was that Joseph thought, well,
we really don't know where

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:90%
the transfiguration took place.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.197 align:middle line:84%
There's three holy mountains
in the Old and New Testament.

00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:90%
You've got Mt.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Sinai.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:90%
You've got Mt.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Mariah, also called
Calvary, the place

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
of the skull, where the
crucifixion took place.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.385 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got
a third mountain,

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
a mysterious place
called Herodium,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
which is considered to be in the
north of Palestine presumably.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's the place where these
light beings come and go,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:84%
toggle back and forth
between the worlds.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Something-- it could be the
artificially tiered mound

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
at Glastonbury
that we're talking

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:90%
about as this scientific center.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's no question
that the earliest form

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity came not from
Palestine but from England,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:10%
from Glastonbury.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:10%
So maybe this
hollowed-out mound is

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:10%
something like what the Celtic
Lore describes, as the Shi

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.390 align:middle line:10%
mounds, where the old
gods, the old heroes

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:10%
dwelled-- the
hollow hills, which

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:10%
were the places of secrets.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They're called Shi
mounds, and they're

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.365 align:middle line:84%
points of entries into Earth's
light body, as it's described.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:90%
We have a light body.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
So does our planet.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And they describe
these points of contact

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
around the planet that
are like rabbit holes,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
where stellar
energies can come in

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
and where light beings
can come and go,

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
as if it's like a portal or
entry way into wonderland.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're scaling
Glastonbury Tor,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
you're immediately met by
these two stone tablets

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
here with this peculiar
glyph marking the path.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:84%
That glyph is the mark for
heaven and three raised.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the druid symbol for
the Godhead, the druid symbol

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:90%
for enlightenment.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And here it is marking our path.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Look familiar?

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
We saw those exact
same three rays

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
in the transfiguration image of
Jesus in the church in Aswan.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
We also saw those three
rays in the Aku glyph

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
of the enlightened
beings of the Egyptians,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:90%
of the wise instructed ones.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:10%
So maybe Glastonbury--
that those three rays,

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:10%
the way I interpret
that is, when

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:10%
you're at a place
of those three rays,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:10%
that's an important place.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That marks a path on
the pilgrims' trail,

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:84%
where you can, in fact,
receive this knowledge.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite convinced
that Glastonbury Tor is one,

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
in fact, when you get
up on top of the tour

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and you see St.
Michael's Tower there,

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:90%
there's that logo once again.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
That is the logo of
these, the wise ones

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
and the instructive ones.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
You want to follow them
around, follow their logo.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, you want
to go to a Ford dealership

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:90%
in Detroit, look for the logo.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to one in
Nashville, look for the logo.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And there you find the
business of Ford Motor.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Same thing here.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
When you see this logo,
you know that the business

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
of these wise and
instructive ones

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:90%
is being done at that place.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And it says, pay attention to
what goes on at that place.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Connect with that place.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Lock into it on an
energetic level.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
And there it is again.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact same symbol,
or a slight variation of it.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.615 align:middle line:84%
Here's John the Baptist
baptizing Jesus.

00:19:11.615 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Here's the dove of the
Holy Spirit descending

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
from the heavenly
realm-- three rays.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:84%
You see that again and
again and again in baptism

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
scenes, when John is
baptizing Jesus here

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:84%
in a vortex of energy,
suggestive of the rainbow body

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:90%
vortex.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
The same three rays.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Here's the dove once again
with exactly the same three

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
rays, in the same vortex of
energy, also in Aswan, Egypt.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:90%
This is the experience I want.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.522 align:middle line:84%
I hope this is the
experience you want, too.

00:19:41.522 --> 00:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
You want one of these energetic
beings, these light beings

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to come along and
drop this knowledge

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
right through the crown
chakra of your head.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You want that energy,
this knowledge,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:90%
directly transmitted to you.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.397 align:middle line:84%
I think it's smart whenever I
see images like this to mimic.

00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:90%
That's what the Egyptians teach.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
When you see Jesus standing
like this, do it back to him.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Just do it back to him.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Receive energy from him.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Beam energy to him.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.334 align:middle line:90%
If you want it.

00:20:12.334 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You look kind of funny when
you're in the temples of Egypt

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
doing that, but that's the
way the Egyptians set up

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:90%
those temples.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
They wanted you to mimic what
you're seeing in those temple

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:90%
scenes and to embody that.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And you want to bring
that energy into you.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It's fairly certain that
what we're talking about here

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is a full body immersion in
cosmic consciousness or quantum

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.299 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
It sounds crazy to
say that they knew

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of
quantum entanglement,

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
but that's what
we call it today.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.581 align:middle line:84%
They had other terms
for it, but it's

00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
the same concept of being
entangled with the source

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
embody that source

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and be in contact with
these beings at any time.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Here's the "Madonna of the
Book" by Botticelli, 1483.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
It shows Mary with
the baby Jesus.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
on in here, we see

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus is holding a
golden crown in his hand

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and three rays, the
exact same three rays.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
There's your three
rays and a ring.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
He's holding a golden ring
and three small golden spears.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Margaret Starbird
writes that, "These

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
may be thought to
represent the nails he

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:90%
was to suffer on the cross.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But more probably, they
are the esoteric symbol

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
for the triple shafts
of enlightenment,

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
a popular motif of medieval
alchemists and Rosicrucians,"

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
who, no doubt, got those
three shafts or three rays

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
from the wise beings
of ancient Egypt.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.872 align:middle line:84%
It's a continuous
transmission of this knowledge

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:84%
straight up into modern
times, the Rosicrucians

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.182 align:middle line:90%
being formed in 600 AD.

00:21:32.182 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
This brings up the idea of
celestial intermediaries.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Where do we meet these guys?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
We find the critical gnostic
wordplay between Nazarene,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
one of Jesus's
titles, and Nazar,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.565 align:middle line:90%
meaning keep, guide, protect.

00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the word Nash,
or Nahash, Hebrew for serpent,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:90%
as in serpent of wisdom.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
"Specifically, Jesus
guarded or watched

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the ancient
science of ascension,

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
salvation, and
enlightenment," which are

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:90%
referred to as Nahash, or Nash.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, when we
come to Nashville,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
what do we see but an
artificially tiered mound,

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
similar to Glastonbury
Tor, with a tor sitting up

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
on top of it, a
steeple, or a tower

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:90%
just like we see at Glastonbury.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.162 align:middle line:90%
Same configuration.

00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of interesting,
slightly coincidental.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Does it mean anything?

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Does to me.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look at this
artificially tiered mound,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
this hollow hill,
as a matter of fact.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It is hollow, with its tower on
top right out in front of it is

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
the cord of three stars at the
end of a 2,200-foot long rod

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
with three stars,
or three rays--

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the three shafts
of enlightenment.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
What this tells me is that
this is an important place.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.759 align:middle line:84%
This configuration
is not by chance.

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You have the artificially tiered
hill, just like Glastonbury.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.945 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
tower on top of it.

00:22:55.945 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And right in front of it,
you've got the key symbol

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.426 align:middle line:84%
of these light beings-- three
rays in a circle or a ring.

00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what we
saw in the hand of Jesus

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago-- three shafts,
or three rays, in a ring.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a ring of stones.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But they actually
ring, because there

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
are 50 of these 25-foot tall
solid stone pillars that

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
ring this chord of three
stars, and they all

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:90%
have bells in them.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
What's intriguing
about this is that,

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
when Elijah ascended into
the heavens in a whirlwind

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
at a place called Gilgal,
50 prophets witnessed it.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The biblical definition
of the word "gilgal"

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:90%
is circle of stones.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
circle of stones

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:84%
in a ring fitting the technical
definition of a gilgal,

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and there are 50 of
those pillars there.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence?

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:90%
No, I think that's a gilgal.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a 2,200-foot long
magician's rod that will be

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
walking here shortly that is
laid out in front of our state

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:84%
capitol, which is strikingly
similar to Glastonbury and I

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
think is ultimately a
temple of initiation.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I call it Stargate Park.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:10%
Here's a line drawing of it.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:10%
What it actually represents
is the perfected man.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:10%
This is Robert Fludd's
alchemical diagram

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:10%
of the perfected man.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:10%
And you see the cone
going right up his body.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:10%
And above the crown chakra,
you see three vesicas,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:10%
or three almond-shaped
symbols in a triangle.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:10%
At the Bicentennial
Mall, we have

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:10%
exactly the same
cone-shaped, or rod-shaped,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:10%
tapering thing with three stars
in the pattern of a triangle,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:10%
replacing the three vesicas.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:10%
And what I see here is
not just a coincidence,

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:10%
but I see a direct
correspondence

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:10%
between the rod
and ring of Jesus

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:10%
and the bicentennial
mall, which is

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:10%
a rod with a ring
at the top of it.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:10%
The Bicentennial Mall
here in Nashville

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:10%
is a virtual carbon
copy or mirror

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:10%
image of a diagram from
the second century in China

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:10%
of Meru, the cosmic
axis, the ladder, tower,

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.511 align:middle line:10%
or stairway to heaven.

00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Looks like an antenna,
because that's what

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Mongolian myth says it was.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The immortals dwelled
here because of the energy

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.450 align:middle line:90%
that was emitted from it.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Based upon the striking
similarity of these two

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:84%
diagrams, I wonder, is this
2,200-foot-long magician's rod

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:84%
laid out at the base of our
state capitol actually one

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
of these antennas?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note
here that Meru which

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.956 align:middle line:84%
was the center of the
Buddhist tradition

00:25:34.956 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Hindu
tradition as well.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:10%
Here's a conversation
between Krishna

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:10%
in Arjuna on Mount Meru.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:10%
And again, this is
Meru right here.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:10%
"Listen," said Krishna.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:84%
"To a very great and deep
secret, to the sovereign,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:90%
sublime, and pure mystery.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:10%
In order to reach perfection,
in order to reach perfection,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:10%
it is necessary to acquire
knowledge of oneness,

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:10%
which is above wisdom.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
It is necessary to lift
oneself to the divine being

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
who is above the soul and
even above intelligence.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, this divine being,
this sublime friend,

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:10%
your higher self in my
term, is in each one of us.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:10%
For God dwells within every man,
but few know how to find him.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
way to salvation."

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Finding that inner
divinity within you,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:90%
that higher self is the way.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
people went to Meru.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:84%
That, I suggest, is why people
can come to Nashville, as well,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that that is where we will
be receiving this knowledge.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Nashville is a place of
secrets, a place of wisdom.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thanking all of you
for coming here and everybody

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.583 align:middle line:84%
who is watching this
and participating

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in this, because
we've just scratched

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:90%
the surface here in Nashville.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
We know there's an elephant
in the middle of our town now.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a 2,200-foot-long
magician's rod that marks

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:90%
a place of important secrets.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:90%
What are those secrets?

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Have we fully revealed those?

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Not even close.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:90%
We're just beginning.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's by bringing people here
and enjoying this time together

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.315 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
reveal those secrets.

00:27:10.315 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists
believe that beings

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:84%
come from all different
universes and galaxies.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
They come from universes
beyond as many universes

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:84%
as are grains of sand
in 62 Ganges River beds.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of
universes out there.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It's this whole parallel
universe theory,

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:84%
multiple universe theory,
baby universe theory,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that our universe is
just one grain of sand

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
in 62 Ganges River beds.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of creation out
there for us to explore, OK?

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:10%
The Buddhist travel
in giant towers

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:10%
thousands of stories high
made of woven flower petals.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.334 align:middle line:10%
They travel by the power of
their mind and consciousness.

00:27:51.334 --> 00:27:52.750 align:middle line:10%
Remember Jesus
talking about, hey,

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:10%
make sure before you
build that tower,

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:10%
make sure you can pay for it.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the tower
he's talking about.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why that
looks like a human spinal cord

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
It's because that's one
level of interpretation.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:10%
Jesus is saying, when
you build that tower,

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:10%
make sure you can pay for it.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:10%
That's a really
important statement.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:10%
The reason why is because of
what the Tibetans teach, just

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:10%
like the Cathars.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You'll say, it's going to
cost you everything in order

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:90%
to build this light body.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Every single attachment
you have on this planet,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to let it go.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Everyone, everything
you have ever loved,

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to let it go.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Before you build
this, make sure you

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.510 align:middle line:84%
are willing to give
everything you got to it.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Become fully devoted
to it, because it's

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:90%
going to cost you everything.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Jesus did not come here to
tell you to save up your money

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:90%
to pay for things at Walmart.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.180 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
building the real tower,

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
building your light body.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.032 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
cost everything.

00:29:01.032 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's why the Cathars, they
set up their civilization,

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.823 align:middle line:90%
their culture.

00:29:03.823 --> 00:29:07.232 align:middle line:84%
They had the elect, and
they had the perfect ones.

00:29:07.232 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The elect were their
support, the perfect ones.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have to
have any attachments.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
message of our time.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.300 align:middle line:84%
You want to get through
this present crisis?

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't have any
attachment to anything,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
except your cats or your loved
ones or-- I mean, be realistic.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't have attachment to
things, because they're

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:90%
gone on the blink of an eye.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
America can be gone in about 48
hours from now, Monday morning.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
There's people
talking like that.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Two days from now,
America ceased to exist.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it go?

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know, it's transitory.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:90%
It's illusion.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And the key to
getting through this

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is not to have any attachments
to any outcomes or to anything

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
except this, except getting
yourself pointed north

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that we are
made in the image of God.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a really important point.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:10%
The analogy I like to make is
that of people that have dogs.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:10%
I go to a friend's house,
and they have a dog.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And they built a dog house
out back for their dog.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:84%
They have a nice roof, a
balcony, carpeting, cable TV,

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:90%
hot and cold running water.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
People go away over the top
building their dog house.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The reason is because
they love their dog,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and they want their dog to have
the same comfort and everything

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have,
because we love them.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Why did God make us in this
image here of the Meru axis?

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.500 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I need to
mention that this is supposed

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to be the model upon which
the Tower of Babel was built.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I was in Florida once, and
a scientist came up to me.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was
basically asleep

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:84%
through your presentation until
you put up that blueprint.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.874 align:middle line:90%
I said, what blueprint?

00:30:50.874 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
He went through my slides till
he came to this image right

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And he said, that blueprint.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.728 align:middle line:84%
Proceeded to tell me that
what we're looking at there

00:30:57.728 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is a blueprint for a particle
accelerator, a device

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that can accelerate
protons but can also

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:90%
open stargates and wormholes.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Why does the human
body or skeletal system

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:90%
resemble a particle accelerator?

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.826 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I reason is that's
because that's what it is.

00:31:13.826 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It is a device from
our souls' perspective

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to
open holes in space.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Why did God design us this way?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Because God wants to have
this ultimate capability,

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
the same ability that
God or-- I should

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.611 align:middle line:84%
say, probably the gods, an
intermediary god-- possesses.

00:31:31.611 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
we're designed this way

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:90%
is because God loves us.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And God wants us to have
the same capabilities

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that God or the gods has,
the ability to slice and dice

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
matter, to open
stargates and wormholes,

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to become stargate and
wormhole traveling beings,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.582 align:middle line:90%
to scale the ladder to heaven.

00:31:49.582 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what our
body is ultimately,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.930 align:middle line:84%
is a gateway, a gateway that our
soul uses, a star gateway that

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
connects us to
other star systems

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even to as many worlds
as there are grains of sand

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:90%
in 62 Ganges River beds.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just
absolutely remarkable.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a
whole different take

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:90%
on who we are as beings.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:90%
So questions.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Questions.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Question one.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:84%
How did or does this
metamorphosis occur?

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.248 align:middle line:90%
What force effected this change?

00:32:34.248 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps more importantly, what
does Jesus's mission statement

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:90%
mean to me?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Seek ye first the
cleansing mysteries

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.611 align:middle line:84%
that will transform you
into a being of pure light

00:32:49.611 --> 00:32:51.610 align:middle line:84%
so that you can inherit
the light of my kingdom?

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully it means
a lot, and you

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
recognize that you got to put
some time, energy, and emotion

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.602 align:middle line:90%
into manifesting that.

00:33:00.602 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.746 align:middle line:84%
Another question-- is the
transhumanizing, or morphing,

00:33:07.746 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:84%
of our being into
light something

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
we should, or can only, aspire
to, but never actually achieve?

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:90%
That's for up to you to decide.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Or is this transfiguration
or metamorphosis something

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:90%
we can experience or duplicate?

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Is this really for me?

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Can I, in fact, do this?

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.108 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Is each of us destined
to fulfill or perform

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.190 align:middle line:90%
this mutation?

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.997 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:33:36.997 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And finally, must
we more in order

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
and attain the bliss

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and joy of the promised new
age, the kingdom of light?

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.327 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:52.327 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Your answer to these
life-defining questions

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:84%
answers all the
questions in your life.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:90%
All of them.
