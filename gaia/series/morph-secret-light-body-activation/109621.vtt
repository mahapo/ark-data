00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.992 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>And the decision is to choose
to become a perfect being,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:90%
to choose to become perfect.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:84%
You can't buy perfection at a
Beverly Hills plastic surgeon.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the ideal in our culture.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Perfection means something else.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It means, in the
ideal of the ancients,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
transforming ourselves
into a higher being.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the oldest human
stories, probably-- they

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
say it is the
oldest human story--

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:90%
is the story of Gilgamesh.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Gilgamesh was a Sumerian king.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Gilgamesh is told by a
goddess that he's 2/3 holy.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:90%
He's 2/3 divine and 1/3 human.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And if he wants to access
the Gate of the Gods, said

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
this goddess, he's got
to become a whole being.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:90%
360.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:90%
All.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Complete.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Until then, he's not
going through that gate.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of us, two out
of three in baseball,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:84%
you're making $50
million in a career.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:90%
So two out of three ain't bad.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
But in this area here, two out
of three is not even close.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:90%
We have got to be whole.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Completely holy.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:90%
360.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty high
bar right there.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not setting
ourselves at that bar

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
or aiming ourselves
at that bar, never

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
going to even have a chance
of getting close to that.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
360 is an important number here.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians said that
we have 360 individual senses.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
The whole human being
has access to 360 senses.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Conventional wisdom in our
time says that we have five.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:90%
We recognize five.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Six, if we're lucky.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
If you even remotely
open your mind

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.534 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that clairvoyance
and telepathy are actually

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
a sense, then you
could be talking

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:90%
about a sixth sense out of 360.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Feel like you're operating
with a full deck?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Not even close.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Not even close.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:90%
We have a long way to go.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more within us
that is waiting to emerge,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:90%
waiting to emerge.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Our deepest nature
is divine light.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:10%
That is north for us.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:10%
If we are not set in with
our internal compasses,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:10%
set on that as
our ultimate goal,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:10%
then you're just
wasting your life.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
That's about the only
way you can look at it.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:90%
There's joyride lives.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I believe in reincarnation.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.165 align:middle line:84%
I probably been here at least
10,000 times working on this.

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot of good
times in a lot of those lives.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.755 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
ultimately, I'm going

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:05.521 align:middle line:84%
to have to make that
happen, sooner or later.

00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in a
swimming pool, I'm not

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
the one that goes and
jumps in the deep end.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I walk around the
pool a little bit.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Stick my big toe
in the shallow end.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Just feel like, hey,
what's this like?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.459 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing this
lifetime after lifetime.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But I know eventually, I'm going
to have to jump in that gate

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.352 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not a being of total
love and peace and compassion,

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be like
walking into a blender.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.974 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get my
feathers ruffled.

00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
to come back and do this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:84%
all over again, because
when those counterrotating

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:84%
fields starts spinning
and you enter them,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and if you're not
a being of love,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be that
pleasant of an experience.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:90%
That is north for us.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned Oprah
Winfrey as a Nashvillian.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I always like to bring the
people of Nashville that

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
are really out there
doing the work,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:90%
and give them their props.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Oprah is certainly one.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Another local that I
have great admiration for

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
is a man by the
name of Dave Ramsey.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Dave talks about how our time
and this financial crisis

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is so important for us to
actually live a life of truth.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And I started listening
to Dave about 10 years ago

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
when he started on the
air here in Nashville.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And Dave teaches you
become debt-free,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
from a Christian
perspective, especially.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Biblically-based principles that
says you want to be debt-free.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.604 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you
want to be debt-free

00:04:23.604 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
is not just because it's a
smart thing to do financially.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
debt-free because,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
as he teaches, the rich
rule over the poor,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and the borrower is
servant to the lender.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
As I listen to talk
radio these days,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.356 align:middle line:84%
a lot of conservative talk
radio commentators out there

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that are saying,
we're real comfortable

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
with this new financial
bailout police

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.862 align:middle line:84%
state that's just
been implemented,

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because what it's
designed to do is

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:90%
to control the flow of money.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.536 align:middle line:84%
The government now
determines who gets a loan

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and who doesn't get a loan.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.459 align:middle line:84%
If they control the
money, essentially what

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
they're saying is,
they're controlling you.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.874 align:middle line:84%
And the conservatives
are saying, well,

00:05:00.874 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
we can't really tell if
that's communism or socialism.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It's actually national
socialism, is what it is.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
These are Nazis
that are doing what

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:90%
they did in Germany in 1933.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
This is February
1933 all over again.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
In America, in
March of 1933, FDR

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
had already closed
the banks in America.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Great
Depression came in.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.385 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to avoid
a similar situation.

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.009 align:middle line:84%
And what we've got
are some people here

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that want to make
us all servants.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Servants to the lender.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:90%
And the lender is now the state.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:90%
The state.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:90%
The fuehrer.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.342 align:middle line:90%
The president.

00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
They're interchangeable
terms when you're

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.567 align:middle line:90%
talking about a police state.

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, they've
got their own army.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not one that wants you
to go all paranoid and say,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
the private army's going
to come start knocking

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:90%
on your door any day now.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.215 align:middle line:84%
But that is a very
real possibility.

00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
reason why you want

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:84%
to start unplugging
from this system,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
getting yourself not only
debt-free, but spiritually

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
free.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
As Dave Ramsey teaches, he
said, in the bible, Jesus talks

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.756 align:middle line:84%
about our relationship
with money.

00:06:07.756 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
He says, if you've not been
trustworthy in handling

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
worldly wealth, who will
trust you with true riches?

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Ouch.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:90%
That hurts.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:90%
That hurts.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
What it's saying is, well, if
I'm not good with my money,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
am I really going
to be good when

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:90%
those other senses come online?

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Other people are talking about
an awakening for humanity

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.182 align:middle line:84%
right now, when we're going
to expand our consciousness.

00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
A way of thinking
of that is you're

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
operating with the
five senses right now.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.557 align:middle line:90%
Maybe six.

00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
How different is
your life going to be

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
when you have seven, eight,
or nine of your senses online,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to probe
deeply into matter?

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
You have that not only
clairvoyance, but the ability

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:90%
to peer deeply into matter.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
When you can peer
into outer space,

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
just through your consciousness,
they call it remote viewing

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:90%
is one of the terms four.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Instant manifestation of wishes
is another one of the senses.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The ability to walk on
water is another one

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of these capabilities
that we're talking

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.269 align:middle line:90%
about coming online right now.

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And our money, the way we handle
it, is a reflection of that.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to trust
you with true riches

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't handled
your worldly wealth?

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
For which of you, says Jesus,
intending to build a tower,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
does not sit down
first count the cost

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:84%
whether he has
enough to finish it?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
The way this is interpreted is
that Jesus came here to Earth

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
in order to teach you to save up
and pay for the things you buy.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I think this person had a
far higher mission than that.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Some biblical scholars
say that the tower Jesus

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is referring to is a large
structure, probably used

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:90%
for farming purposes.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.487 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
When these guys wake
up, they're going

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
to see that there's a
whole other reality that

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:90%
is reflected in the statements.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Because any time Jesus
is talking about a tower,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
he's either talking about
his wife, Mary Magdalene,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
whose name meant
the beloved tower,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
or he's specifically referring
to the Tower of Babel, when

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
humankind gathered together
to build a tower that

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
reached into the
heavens so that we

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:90%
may make a name for ourselves.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But in the Old Testament story,
Yahweh, the Old Testament god,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:90%
decided he didn't want company.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So he smashed our tower
and separated humankind

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:90%
by language.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
What's important here is
that the original definition

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of the word babble meant
ladder or stairway to heaven.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
After Yahweh, this Old Testament
slave god, destroys our tower

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and separates us by
language, his scribes

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
then change the meaning of the
word babble from ladder or gate

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to God to confusion
and nonsense.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Get it?

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Humankind, who the
hell do they think they

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:90%
are building a gate to God?

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And so anybody that
talks about that gate

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
is then referred to
as a babbler, which

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is very important, because
when the apostle Paul goes

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Athens and starts
telling about this guy that

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
transfigured himself into
light and resurrected himself

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
from the dead, the Athenian
scholars called him a babbler.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:90%
That's supposed to be an insult.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not an insult. The term
the babbler always meant

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
someone who knew about
the secrets of the Gate

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:90%
to God, the Bab El gate.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
What Yahweh was
concerned about is

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that we would make a
name for ourselves.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is why traditional
scholarship says,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is all
about human hubris.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Who do they think they are,
building this ladder, tower,

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:90%
or gate?

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, that word name

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:84%
has several different
meanings, one of which is soul.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Humankind gathered
together so that they

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:90%
may make a soul for themselves.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, we already have a soul.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:90%
So why do we need to make one?

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we needed to improve
our soul in some way.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.064 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
What the Old Testament
god was concerned about

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
is that nothing that we
will do after building

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
this Tower of Babel will
be impossible to us.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
That was the problem.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Because once we learned
the secrets of this gate

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and how to accentuate the
capabilities of our soul,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
nothing will be
impossible to us.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We no longer will have a use
for Yahweh, either, or probably

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
his New Testament
representative,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, because then,
all of a sudden,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:90%
the structure comes down.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.612 align:middle line:90%
We can do this for ourselves.

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was always the
message in the ancient world.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't need, to
quote Carlos Santana,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:90%
we didn't need a pope.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We didn't need a priest,
a politician, or a pimp.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
They're all the same
thing, ultimately.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:10%
We only needed ourselves.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:10%
And when they took down
the Tower of Babel,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:10%
they took that away
from us, and told us

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:10%
we now need a president
to tell us what to do.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:84%
We need all these
other intermediaries.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.496 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, biblical
scholars like David Rohl,

00:11:01.496 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:10%
who's also an
archaeologist, says

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that the original tower of
Babel was in ancient Egypt.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:10%
It was called the Osiris
Device, the tower or the bond

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:10%
between heaven and Earth.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:10%
When we look at
the Osiris Device

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:10%
from this awakened
perspective, we

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:10%
recognize that that tower
is, in fact, our body.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:10%
And what we are
all learning to do

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:10%
is to activate the latent
capabilities of our bodies.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, suddenly
we're out of control.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Now you're not in the clutches
or the grasp of someone

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
telling you what
to do, and you must

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:90%
be a slave to this god being.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are able to become
a fully activated being.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.432 align:middle line:84%
I once heard a
sports broadcaster

00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:84%
say there's three names that
we have-- the one you're

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
born with, the
one you're called,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and the one you
make for yourself.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:90%
The one you make for yourself.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And remember, that word
name also means soul.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what are
you doing to activate your soul,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.586 align:middle line:90%
to enlighten your soul?

00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this from a
slightly different perspective.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
That word "shem" was the
Old Testament word for name.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
We're gathering together
to build a tower,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
amplify the power of our bodies,
so we can make a gate to God.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And that word for name was shem.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Shem is also the name for
the old Babylonian sun god

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Shamash, whose portrayed here
stepping through this gateway

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
with beams of light
coming from his shoulders.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the original star
gate religion, right here,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
because whenever you see the
ancient Babylonian gods coming

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and going from the
Earth plane, they

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
are always doing
so through gateways

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:90%
that lead to the stars.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I prefer to call
them star gates.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the Hebrew
word translated name is shem.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It has the additional
meaning of prosperity.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is, of course, the
name of Noah's favorite son.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
important to recognize

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
that the use of
the word shem also

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
refers to shining ones or a
shining aspect of ourselves,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of people literally who are
shining or radiating light.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we take this and we
go back to that Babel story,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament slave
god Yahweh is saying,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm very concerned here that
these worthless pieces of crap

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
sinning garbage humans,
which is the perspective

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.615 align:middle line:84%
that this Old
Testament god views us

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
as, he's very concerned
that suddenly we're

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
learning the secrets
of transfiguration,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and we might somehow
become shining ones.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:90%
We won't be slaves anymore.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
We won't be worshipping
this master god anymore.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:90%
We'll be sovereign beings.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are, now
confronted with this idea

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that what the Babel
story was all about

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
was humankind gathering
together to learn

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
the secrets, the stargate
secrets of the gods,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
which entailed the
transfiguration

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:84%
or transformation of
our bodies into light.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Old Testament god
was having none of that.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:19.205 align:middle line:84%
So he destroys the tower,
separates us by language.

00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Book of Genesis says there
were giants in the Earth

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
in those days, and also after
that, when the sons of God

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
came into the daughters of men,
and they bore children to them,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:84%
the same being mighty men,
which were the men of renown

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:90%
or the men of shem.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:90%
They were light beings.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And they intended
for us to also learn

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
to become light beings as
well, fully able and capable

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
of accessing the star
gates of the gods.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole mission
in the New Testament

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus comes to fulfill,
showing us that transfiguration

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.464 align:middle line:90%
is our destination.

00:14:53.464 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
supposed to be doing.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, there's
not one single Christian church

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
anywhere that I've found on
this planet that will teach you

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
how to activate
your light being,

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
how to personally make the
transfiguration your life

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
mission, and to help
you to fulfill that.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Something's wrong
with that picture.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Something is very wrong
with that picture.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.916 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
time to get into what

00:15:19.916 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:90%
is wrong with that picture.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But let's just go
forward here and look

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
at some of the different
definitions of our light body.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It's called the divine body.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here using various
transfiguration images of Jesus

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
because, that's, in our
Western culture, the being

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that we most closely
identify with this.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
But in ancient Egypt, it
was called the luminous body

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:90%
or being.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called the body of bliss
and the superconductive body.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pay close
attention to the names that

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
are given to the light
body in various traditions,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're, one,
highly descriptive,

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and they tell you exactly
what that light body is

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and what your life
will be like once you

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:90%
have activated your light body.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the body of bliss.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
That's supposed to be our
natural state of existence--

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:90%
bliss, not fear.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Bliss.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the superconducting
body, is another term for it.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And notice again, the
consistency of these images.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Always, Jesus has the
bright white garment

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
with an open gate behind
them that I'm submitting

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:90%
to you is actually a star gate.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
In the Mithraic
liturgy, the light body

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:90%
was called the perfect body.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.852 align:middle line:90%
The perfect body.

00:16:30.852 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The perfect body,
again, is not something

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
you get at a Beverly
Hills plastic surgeon.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
When a human is perfect, it
means they are a light being.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Until then, we're not perfect.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:10%
In the philosophy
of Sri Aurobindo,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:10%
it's called the divine
body, and is composed

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:10%
of supramental substance.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Supramental substance,
beyond mental substance,

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:10%
which is why we've got
to learn to activate some

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:10%
of these extra senses
that we have so

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:10%
that we can connect with
this extra mental substance

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:10%
and bring it down
into this dimension.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:10%
In the philosophy of
Teilhard de Chardin,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:10%
the light body is
called the ultra human.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I had an interview once
with a radio interviewer.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
He had just got his
master's in divinity.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%
And he's all off and running.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to go
preach to the world

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
all about Jesus Christ, as we
pronounce it here in Tennessee.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And I start talking
about the light body.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I said it's called
the ultra human.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:90%
His response?

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this dehumanizing?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Do what?

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You just spent $50,000 to get
a master's degree in divinity,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and you think this
is dehumanizing?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
That's my point, is that
traditional Christianity thinks

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
this is a bunch of bullshit.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
This is not happening for
you or I or anybody else

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
except one single human.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong
with that picture.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
If we have a culture, and
especially a religious base

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
in our culture,
that is saying you

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:84%
can't do that because
you're not good enough,

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:90%
that's the message.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:10%
But we have to begin
to change that.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.775 align:middle line:10%
In Tibet, they call this great
perfection or mystic rapture.

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:18.233 align:middle line:84%
Drive around
Tennessee here, you're

00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
going to see people
with bumper stickers

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.726 align:middle line:84%
on the back of their
car-- in case of rapture,

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:90%
this car might be empty.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Like it's going to
happen, just like that.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:90%
It might.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Who am I to say that Jesus isn't
flying around in his spaceship

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:84%
right now, got that star
gate open, and he's just

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
looking around for who's been
naughty and who's been nice?

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's the nice
ones that are going

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:84%
to zap you right
into your light body,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
experience the mystic rapture.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do anything.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you have to
do nothing for that.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.305 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] UFOs
either, though.

00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:51.471 align:middle line:90%
So what are you going to do?

00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, right.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:10%
Mystic rapture.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's about a yogi who
has acquired the highest

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:10%
forms of human
accomplishment, can transform

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:10%
the subtle aspects of
their body into pure light,

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:10%
or what is called the rainbow
body or the body of light.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:10%
Usually, this
happens after death.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.873 align:middle line:10%
But it's been known to
happen at other times

00:19:12.873 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:10%
and in front of witnesses.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much a body, but
it's rather a vortex of energy

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
into which these adepts
can transform themselves

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.139 align:middle line:90%
upon dying.

00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
And so they show it here.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.846 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the
eyes, nose, and mouth

00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
here with the five-colored
rainbow light.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a Tibetan
who has effected

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:84%
the rapture, the mystic rapture,
and transfigured themselves

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:90%
into a light being.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And they do it by changing
the vibration of their body.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And they then dissolve the
subtle essences of their body

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
into light, leaving behind
only hair, toe, fingernails,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
which have no nerves
to be transmuted.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
That is what is
wired into your DNA.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
that Old Testament

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
god was so afraid
of-- that you actually

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
have within you this
natural capability

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to go from a pupal form
into a transfigured form,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:90%
or, metaphorically, a butterfly.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
The fact of matter is that
this teaching of mystic rapture

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
appears in all cultures
and all civilizations.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And almost everywhere,
you've got religious despots

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and others that seek to
prevent you from learning this.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Very important that we
start bringing this forward.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
Tibetan imagery of this,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
especially out back behind
the Potala Palace in Lhasa

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:84%
is the Dalai Lama's
secret temple.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And inside that temple
are all of these images

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of transfigured
beings, beings who

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
have transformed or transfigured
themselves into light,

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and are now portrayed
in these rainbow rings.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They are in the ring
of cosmic sovereignty.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, many
Tibetans believe

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that just seeing
these revered images

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
opens the mind to
hidden spiritual truths.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Just seeing them.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do, all our
higher self needs and all

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:90%
our DNA needs, is that target.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, we need to
say yes, that this

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is the path I am setting
and directing my life on.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan said that
effecting the great perfection

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:90%
is really easy.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a
three-step process.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is, one, imagine it.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to be introduced
to your own nature.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
You are a cocoon.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Within your DNA
and your circuitry

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to
become a light being.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:90%
That's your true nature.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You are a being of pure love
that has been, like a mushroom,

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
put in the dark and
fed a bunch of crap.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to
believe it, to not remain

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:90%
in doubt about this state.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.252 align:middle line:90%
Sounds easy, doesn't it?

00:21:44.252 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's the most
difficult part,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.040 align:middle line:84%
is to continue believing
that this is who I truly am,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
when every bit of our culture
says, this is not true.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:90%
This is not you.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Then, the third
part is to live it.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You've got to continue to
be in this state of belief.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.576 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we spend lifetime

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime pursuing
these mysteries,

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
is so that we can
make this happen.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, when we see
the Tibetan spinning himself

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:84%
into a vortex of
light here, it's

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
the same as the Sufi
wormhole dancer.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was giving a
presentation on this one time

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Lovely couple came up
to me and said, hey,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.027 align:middle line:84%
we listen to your
radio interviews.

00:22:31.027 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:90%
We love what you're doing.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.587 align:middle line:90%
Read all your books.

00:22:33.587 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They proceeded to tell
me that they both had

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:84%
PhDs from the Harvard
Divinity School,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.014 align:middle line:90%
that they know the Dalai Lama.

00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:90%
They've been to Tibet.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They had been
translating many of

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:90%
the secret Tibetan documents.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.133 align:middle line:84%
And they said that what
my research answered

00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:49.437 align:middle line:84%
for them is something the
Dalai Lama wouldn't answer,

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:84%
or the Tibetans would
reveal, because it's secret.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is, what happens after
these guys spin themselves

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:90%
into a vortex of energy?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans have
direct knowledge

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
about 28 different,
unique solar systems.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
So where do they go?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your research
answered the question for us.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when this
lama spins himself

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
into a vortex of energy,
he's opening a wormhole.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's traveling from
Earth to other solar systems

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
through a star
gate or a wormhole.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we think
you're absolutely correct when

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
you say the human body is a
star gate device from our soul's

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It is the Tower of Babel.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to
dedicate our lives to

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is accentuating the
powers of our soul

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and transforming this body
into a star gate, which

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:90%
is what it is wired to do.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So here we see the Tibetans in
their rainbow ring, symbolic

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.405 align:middle line:84%
of the rapture, of
the rainbow body.

00:23:54.405 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
This is why Jesus
rides a rainbow.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%
This is pure Tibetan symbolism.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus learned this
in Tibet, according

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
to scholars who have traced
his missing 18 years, from 12

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:90%
until 30.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
He was in Tibet, learning the
secrets of mystic rapture,

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of transfiguration
and the star gate

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:90%
secrets of the ancient gods.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when Jesus is
on this rainbow ring,

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
it means exactly the same
thing it means in Tibet.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:90%
He is a transfigured being.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
He has spun himself into
this vortex of energy,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and has now raised
himself from the dead.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
the dead, we are the dead.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:90%
We're dead in this form.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.824 align:middle line:84%
We're alive when we're
in our light body form.

00:24:39.824 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:90%
The Lord rose from the dead.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:90%
He became as he was.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:90%
But now, his body was perfect.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
We know what that
word means now.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:84%
He possessed flesh, but
this was true flesh.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Our flesh isn't true.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Ours is only an
image of the true.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Ours is only an
image of the true.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, I'm going to
talk about mystic rapture

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
in light of the modern
scientific concept called

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:90%
quantum entanglement.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:90%
How can Jesus be everywhere?

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement
answers that exactly.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about
how we are, in fact,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
a copy of our true
selves or higher selves.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this comes
from the Gospel of Philip.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So we see the word
perfection popping up here.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see it
over and over again.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it means.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, fourth-century Jesus
riding on the rainbow.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:90%
That's symbolic of his throne.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly the same as
the Tibetan rainbow body.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
It means he has transfigured
himself into a light being,

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.335 align:middle line:84%
and is now capable of
traveling throughout the stars

00:25:38.335 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and the heavens as a light being
through the naturally-occurring

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:84%
star gates and wormholes that
permeate the known galaxy.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no other way to look
at this, because, as I said--

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and I sound harsh--
but there's not

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
a single Christian
church anywhere

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:90%
that teaches you to do this.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with this story?

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe it's a timing thing.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe now is the time
when we're to understand

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the transfiguration of Jesus
and the great perfection

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or mystic rapture
of the Tibetans

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:90%
is exactly the same thing.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.639 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Dalai Lama says
that this transfiguration

00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen in the west.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The secrets of
transfiguration will

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:90%
emerge full-blown in the west.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:90%
That's Tibetan prophecy.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in
America right now,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:90%
struggling with this concept.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.832 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:28.832 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Did he say in or from?

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>In.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:90%
In the west.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the Capitol Rotunda,
our United States capitol.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:84%
As we power in here, what
we see is George Washington

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:90%
in a gate of stars.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to call
that a star gate.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.419 align:middle line:84%
But then, that's, I
guess, my prerogative.

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
George Washington
in a gate of stars.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
What's he doing up there?

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:84%
George, what you
doing up there, baby?

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
This is called "The Apotheosis
of George Washington."

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the title
of this painting.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I used that word
apotheosis earlier.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.302 align:middle line:84%
It means the transformation
of a man into a god man.

00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
When the United States
Capitol was built,

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:84%
the Rotunda, right
after the Civil War,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
this painting by
Brumidi was put in there

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:84%
of the apotheosis, the
transfiguration of George

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Washington into a god man.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And to complete
the painting here,

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
George Washington is
actually shown on a rainbow.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:84%
There's only one reason
why you do that and call

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.990 align:middle line:84%
this painting "The Apotheosis
of George Washington."

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to connect
him with the gods

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient past, with
Jesus, with the Tibetans,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
with Shamash and all the
shining ones of the past.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:84%
That was the original hope
and promise of America,

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:84%
is that this would
be a land of liberty.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a current president
that goes to Iraq and says,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.886 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give
you all liberty.

00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
What that means
is the same thing

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
it means when a sailor
gets off a ship in a port.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.043 align:middle line:84%
It means, you better
get your ass back

00:27:56.043 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
on that ship in
about 40 minutes,

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.920 align:middle line:84%
or we're going throw
you in the brig. That's

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
what liberty means
when they talk about it

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:90%
from the political sense.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Liberty, to these
guys, meant this

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
is a land where you are
free to transform yourself

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:90%
into a higher being.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Is America any way, shape,
and form even remotely close

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.135 align:middle line:90%
to that vision today?

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Wrong George.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:90%
We've dug ourselves a hole.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Dug ourselves a black
hole, as a matter of fact.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do is turn
that black hole into a wormhole

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.207 align:middle line:90%
and come out the other end.

00:28:34.207 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
is all about right now.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the choice we're all
making, is to become perfect.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of
Philip says, we must

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.005 align:middle line:84%
become perfect before
leaving this world.

00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Or what it should
say is, you're going

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to come back again and again and
again until you become perfect.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.753 align:middle line:84%
Take your time, but
ultimately, you're

00:28:56.753 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:84%
going to have to dive in to that
water gate, to that star gate.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So might as well start
now becoming as perfect

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
as we possibly
can, And, as I say,

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
get rid of your traditional
understanding of the word

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
perfect, because it does not
mean what you think it means.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I hear these guys on the radio.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.530 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, and
he came in great glory.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means the
same thing as perfect.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It means that this was a
light being, a being that

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.310 align:middle line:84%
can toggle back and forth
between the dimensions,

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
can perform all of these
miracles because he's harnessed

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
the power and the
understanding of matter,

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of light.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're all after here.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So I've been collecting
all of these images

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.925 align:middle line:84%
because, again, what
the Tibetans teach

00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
is that just seeing these images
awakens a part of ourselves.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:90%
It acts like a homing beacon.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It locks us on and says,
this is what it's all about.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is
how we are to spend

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:90%
our lives-- focusing on this.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Have a great time, but
recognize that ultimately,

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to get aimed north.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And north, for each
of us, is going right

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.759 align:middle line:84%
through that gateway, becoming
one of these ascended beings.

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:09.259 align:middle line:90%
