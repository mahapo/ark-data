00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:11.680 align:middle line:84%
WILLIAM HENRY: Good
morning everybody,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and welcome to
Morph, into light.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The Secret of Light
Body Activation.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling this a
presentation of Stargate U.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.070 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see why within
just a couple minutes here.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to begin by just
taking a moment to reflect.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:84%
What has led you to
this very moment?

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.636 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeking a path towards
becoming an awakened being?

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you see your own
potential to become

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:90%
something more than human?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.719 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, how will
you know when you get there?

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Those are many of the
questions we're going

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about today.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to also bring
in an email I received

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
from a person who wrote to me
who had interest in this event.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, William, I read over
the info on your conference

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and found it interesting.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
All I read was
informal get together,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:84%
lecture, tour, presentation
and informal brunch.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't where he
got the brunch idea.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.509 align:middle line:90%
All of which sounds interesting.

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I did not read anything
about an hour activation.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Will there be an activation?

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Bob.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Bob.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Many thanks for writing.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Please tell me what,
exactly, you're

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
anticipating or
expecting and I'll be

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:90%
happy to answer your question.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that covers
a lot of territory.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.407 align:middle line:10%
And so then he writes back and
he says, expecting, you wrote,

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:10%
informal get together,
lecture, tour, presentation

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:10%
and informal brunch.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:10%
Yada, yada.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:10%
Yet the name of your conference
has the word activation in it.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:10%
Will you be doing an
activation with honor

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:10%
for those that attend.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.025 align:middle line:90%
Have no fear.

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to zap you into
a ball of light or anything

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:90%
You've been very approachable.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.515 align:middle line:84%
He says sadly, and this
is why I introduce this.

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:90%
This is very poignant.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, sadly, I am one of
those the read some-- the Bible

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and other things-- all of which
said, to my understanding,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are capable of
many wonderful things.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
None of which I was
living or seeing.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.572 align:middle line:90%
So I started taking seminars.

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Here again, they all seemed
to say much was possible,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.955 align:middle line:84%
but I never really
seem to get it.

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
It, being the ability
to really change

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
my life for the better the way
I wanted or was led to believe

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:90%
was possible.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that
my last hope is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that someone, somewhere
somehow will do an activation,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
integration, healing
or something that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
will flip the switch,
turn me on so that I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.965 align:middle line:90%
can be all that I can be.

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I am 64 so my time
is running out.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.332 align:middle line:90%
I took my first seminar in '72.

00:02:40.332 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he mentions
that he'd been

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:90%
doing readings and all of this.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote back and I said,
Bob, what you're asking for

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate gift.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Only you can give
it to yourself.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I think you're doing
great, I wrote to him.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that everything
he's been doing,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
like all of us--
everything that each of us

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
has been doing our entire
lives is activating healing

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and helping us to get it.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time
for you to be it.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
As Nike says, just do it.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Flip the switch to yes.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main
thing I'm hoping

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to work with you
all on this weekend

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is, let's just flip
the switch to yes.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Further, what I hope to do as
a methodologist-- and that's

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:90%
my role.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm an investigative
methodologist.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I research ancient
myths and legends.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to put some
esoteric knowledge,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
mythological knowledge into your
repertoire, into your thinking

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
about what it means to be
an activated human, which

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:90%
is defined as a light being.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And hoping to prepare you
for the most extraordinary

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
experience that
any of us can have.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
That experience comes when we
have a meeting with our higher

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
self and we are given the
gift of the ultimate knowledge

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.029 align:middle line:84%
about how to
transform ourselves.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.945 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
hoping to prepare you for,

00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is to give you the
background knowledge,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:90%
the lore that goes with that.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I've researched many of the
prophets-- Enoch, Elijah,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, who have
received this activation.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were all masters
of ancient mythology,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric lore
because they knew

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:84%
there was going to come
a time when they're

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
going to have what is
described as an interview

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:90%
with your higher self.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
If you pass that
interview and get the job,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
you're good to go,
ready to launch.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Few ideas in the ancient
world, in this regard,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
played a more important
role than the notion

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of the heavenly tablets
or the heavenly book.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're all after.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most significant
features in this history

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:90%
is often overlooked.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
this book is put

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
in the palm of our hand
by a heavenly being

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:90%
or a group of heavenly beings.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.597 align:middle line:84%
In the story of Enoch,
it says explicitly

00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
from the heavenly
being that, "I shall

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
place the tablets of
wisdom in thy hand."

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and these are "the
symbol of sovereignty."

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want to come off
as sounding all paranoid here,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
but there's a group of
people on this planet that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
would like to put something
else in the palm of your hand,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:90%
namely a little chip.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I think we
have less than five years

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.069 align:middle line:84%
to get this knowledge
about sovereignty

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
put in the palm of our hands
before somebody else comes

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
along and decides they're going
to imprison us even further.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the same
information is so important.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a tremendous
opportunity on this planet

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
right now to learn about
becoming sovereign beings,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to become fully
activated humans.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.306 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not knowledgeable
in the lore and the lingo,

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
if you sit down
in that interview

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and don't know what
they're talking about,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to go well.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But if I do my job
right, I'm going

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
to prepare you for that
interview and even more.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite subjects
in this regard is King Seti.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
He lived in ancient
Egypt, a little bit

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:90%
after the time of Moses.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:90%
He'd go into his temple.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's portrayed here
kneeling in a Sycamore tree

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
before the god Ptah,
the Egyptian creator

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
god who, were told, actually
created the human body

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and also created a whole
lot of other technology

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice is that Seti
here is kneeling before Ptah,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and Ptah is literally writing
the secrets of eternity right

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:90%
into Seti's hand.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Seti is known as one of
the transfigured ones.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
He was able to transfigure or
metamorphose himself into light

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and now toggles back and
forth between the worlds,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:90%
according to the lore.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:10%
"To see the world in a grain
of sand," wrote William Blake,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:10%
"and to see heaven
in a wild flower,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:10%
hold infinity in the
palm of your hands,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:10%
and eternity in an hour."

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:10%
That's our goal.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:10%
We want that knowledge
and we want it

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:10%
placed in the palm of our hand.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the ancient and
venerable stargate mystery

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.477 align:middle line:84%
school, or Stargate University
as I to refer to it,

00:06:54.477 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is to have an interview with
your Higher Self, your True

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Self.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Get the Heavenly Book and
then achieve conscious union

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:90%
with the God Head.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:90%
That is our ultimate mission.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.936 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner
says, "If you want

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
to know your Higher
Self, look at the people

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:90%
you've met in the last year."

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
What have you attracted
into your life?

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
What have you done
this past year?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Where have you gone?

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.865 align:middle line:84%
Who have you
interacted with that

00:07:19.865 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is feeding your
light body, feeding

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:90%
this activation within you.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.364 align:middle line:84%
So obviously you
all that are here

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and those that are
watching are representative

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:90%
of my Higher Self.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
My Higher Self is that part
they can look on down the road

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.502 align:middle line:90%
and says, hey.

00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Bring these people together
because that person

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.266 align:middle line:84%
or that person might just have
that key piece of information

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
or knowledge that you
need that going to help

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.954 align:middle line:90%
you flip from no to yes.

00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
This gift that
we're talking about

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
is also referred to as gnosis.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Gnosis, the power or gift of
receiving and understanding

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:84%
revelation, which finally
culminates in the direct

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
unveiled vision of God and the
transformation or metamorphosis

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.505 align:middle line:84%
of the whole human into a
spiritual being by contact

00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:90%
with the Deity.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
There's no guru that
can do this for you.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't go to Tibet
and sit at a llamas feet

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%
and have him do this for you.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Only you can do
this for yourself

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
by making contact
with the Deity.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
By revelation here is meant
the unfolding or unveiling

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge about the
process of transformation

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:90%
or transfiguration.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Metamorphosis.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.269 align:middle line:90%
Apotheosis is another word.

00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
These are big words,
but you're going

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
to hear them over and
over, and you'll really

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
get a familiarity with them
in just a few minutes here.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Transfiguration, metamorphosis,
a change in form Apotheosis,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:84%
the transformation of
a man into a god man.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.249 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about transfiguration,

00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
most people are familiar
with the story of Jesus.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
He takes the disciples,
Peter, John and James,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and takes them up to
the top of the mountain.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, like
something out of the movie,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
"Cocoon," he peels back the skin
and reveals that he, in fact,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:90%
is a being of light.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.952 align:middle line:84%
It scares the crap out
of those disciples.

00:09:03.952 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
They're terrified at
what they're seeing.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.566 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly this man has revealed
himself as something more.

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, traditional
Christianity

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:84%
says this transfiguration
is Jesus' greatest miracle.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
How could he have poured
this magnificent light being

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:90%
into one of these flesh bags?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, he did.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he ultimately reveals
himself as a light thing,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and tells us that this
is our destination.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what each of us has
the capability of doing.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, each of us are
not only asked to do that.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We're told that is what we are
to do in our earthly existence.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone about
collecting various images

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of transfiguration
because they are

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
so informative about
this event, when

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
we start to look at them from
this perspective of the change

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and metamorphosis
that's indicated here.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
What we see is that in
each of these examples,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Jesus wears bright
white clothing.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
That's symbolic of his light
body, of this light being.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
portrayed standing

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
before an open gateway.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a 2-step process.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
First we learn to
activate the light body,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and then the light
body knows how

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
to open that gate into
the higher realms.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Peter, reflecting on
this extraordinary event

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
many years later recalls,
"we were eyewitnesses

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.826 align:middle line:90%
of his sovereign majesty."

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Today we have kings and
queens on this planet

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that refer to themselves
a sovereign beings.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not sovereign in
any way, shape, or form.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Sovereignty is when you
have transfigured yourself

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:90%
into a light being.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Then you can go, be, see,
do whatever you want.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Until then, you're a pretender
if you're calling yourself

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:90%
a sovereign.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Matthew and Mark called this
event the transfiguration

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:90%
or the metamorphosis.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
These are the Biblical
terms for this event.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Metamorphosis.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
A change in form.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like when the
caterpillar transfigures

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:10%
into the butterfly.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:10%
That's the shift
we're talking about.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.532 align:middle line:84%
The problem for the
mass of humanity,

00:11:08.532 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
whether we've been
conditioned to do this

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
or we choose to do this is,
we're like the caterpillar

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.330 align:middle line:84%
looking up at the
butterfly saying,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get me up
in one of those things.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I'm going
to take this mortal coil

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and spin it into
a being of light.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
If you say so.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:90%
If you say so.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with saying yes,
that this is the possibility,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and then setting
ourselves on this path.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Our body knows how
to do this naturally.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
The cocoon doesn't have to go
to cocoon, or butterfly school.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It's in its DNA.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.464 align:middle line:84%
What it needs is a model
to show it how to do that.

00:11:47.464 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
we're all looking for today,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
are examples or people
that have actually

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.521 align:middle line:90%
affected this transfiguration.

00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And the primary model in the
Christian tradition, of course,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%
is Jesus.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.614 align:middle line:84%
But this crosses over
many different cultures.

00:11:59.614 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about those various cultures

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.026 align:middle line:84%
and how they approached
the transfiguration

00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:90%
and demonstrated it.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But for us here in the
West, the best example

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
we have is the
transfiguration of Jesus.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.831 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful images, but highly
instructive, as we'll see.

00:12:15.831 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want
you to take note of

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is that we're looking at
a two-dimensional image

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
here of what is surely a
three-dimensional energy field.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
This looks like a star
around Jesus' body

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
but actually what it is is
counter-rotating energy fields.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The best example I can give
you is the Moravian star.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
These are beautiful
stained glass stars

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that started appearing
in the 19th century.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:84%
They symbolize the advent,
the return of the light,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and also symbolize Jesus as
the bright and morning star.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a
really good example here

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
of what this three-dimensional
energy field of the activated

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:90%
light body actually is like.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It's also referred
to as the Merkabah.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And some here have probably
had a lot of familiarity

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.054 align:middle line:90%
with Merkabah mysticism.

00:13:03.054 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
we're talking about.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:90%
This is an ancient science.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.251 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Mary Magdalene John the
Baptist, Peter, James, John,

00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Joseph.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:84%
All of those guys were part of
a esoteric research group that

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
were scouring the ancient
world for knowledge

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
about how to affect
this transfiguration.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus was the role model
for this light body effect,

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:90%
as I also refer to it.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite examples

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
here, where again you see
clearly Jesus in this radiant

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
energy field with
the gate behind him,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
with the counter-rotating
fields all around his body.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I was in Egypt a
couple of years ago.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a Whirling
Dervish dancer.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And he demonstrated
for me what I

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
think of as this whole
transfiguration process

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:90%
from a Sufi perspective.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:90%
The dancer stood in place.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts spinning
his skirt around his body.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And first I'm saying,
wow, it looks like a UFO.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
He looks like Elijah in the
whirlwind, or Ezekiel, or any

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
of those guys that ascended
into the heavens in whirlwinds,

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
which have been interpreted
in the modern age

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:90%
as metallic craft, as UFOs.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So he keeps spinning
this thing, and it's

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and
more clear that that's

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
what he's done here,
is spun himself

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
into this whirlwind,
this vortex of energy,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:90%
looking something like a galaxy.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't stop there.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
He pulls out a second
skirt and starts

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.425 align:middle line:84%
spinning that around his body
in a counter-rotating fashion.

00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I'm saying, wait a minute.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that shape before.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
That looks just like
the way modern science

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:90%
portrays a wormhole.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So I called this dance
the wormhole dance.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.035 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to this
dancer afterward,

00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and I said, what you've
just demonstrated

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
was the whole story
that modern physics says

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
is what ultimately represents
the salvation of our species.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
If we can learn how to open
these holes in space and travel

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
from point A to point B as if
there were nothing in between,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.132 align:middle line:90%
it changes everything.

00:15:06.132 --> 00:15:07.965 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what he did
at the end of the dance

00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
is his partner brings
out this linen sheet.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
He wraps one of the skirts into
a bundle and feeds milk to it.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And the message is clear.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:84%
As he told me afterward,
what he demonstrated

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
for us was the story about
the unity of heaven and earth,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and where we come from,
and how we got here.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And also, I think, how we leave.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
We leave by opening what
is referred to today

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:90%
is a stargate or a wormhole.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how we got here.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
A naturally occurring
phenomenon in the galaxy.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
An after effect of
the Big Bang that's

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a
transportation system that

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
weaves its way
through the galaxies.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
look at Jesus here,

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.007 align:middle line:84%
he's got his bright white
clothing on-- his light body.

00:15:52.007 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And he stands in front of
that open gateway, which

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I think of as the mouth or
open gate of a wormhole.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I would suggest
that when Jesus is portrayed

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
from the front-on
perspective, if we looked

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
at him from the side
view, he'd probably

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
look something very similar to
this Whirling Dervish dancer.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
You see the spinning
motion all around him.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, early
Christianity talked

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.646 align:middle line:84%
about a ring dance
or a round dance

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was
said to have done,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that was outlawed
by the early church.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if that ring
dance that Jesus was doing

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
was the Whirling Dervish
dance, spinning himself

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.115 align:middle line:84%
into this vortex, into
a meditative state

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and enabling conscious
connection with a higher realm.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Today when we talk
about stargates,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:84%
most people think of the TV
show, "Stargate," or the movie,

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:84%
"Stargate," or the
movie, "Contact."

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
these are all kind of
like new revelations

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:90%
of this ancient story.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done in my work
is to say, well, wait a minute.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is here standing
before an open gateway.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It looks suspiciously
like the open gateway

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that's portrayed in
the movie, "Stargate."

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible, I wonder,
that what Jesus is doing

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:90%
is accessing these stargates.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Was there are ancient
technology involved?

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure about that.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But I am convinced that that's
what the transfiguration

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
or metamorphosis
story is all about,

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is the transfiguration of
Jesus into a light being

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
preparatory to entering these
naturally occurring stargates

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that take us from
point A on Earth

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to point B anywhere in the
universe we choose to go.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Another way that modern science
conceives of these wormholes

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.835 align:middle line:84%
is they have this
U-shaped gateway.

00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:90%
You have the open gateway here.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that you
could enter that gateway,

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
travel through space
time, and come out

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
the other end is if there
were nothing in between.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a radical
revolution in physics.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe what
we're rediscovering is

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
an ancient sacred science
about how to actually affect

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:90%
this transfiguration.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So if I refer to
stargate Christianity,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
you know that what I'm talking
about is the transfiguration

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates to modern
stargate science or theory

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's no coincidence that
the letter U is the shape

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:90%
we assign to a wormhole.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I think we morph
into a beam of light

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
before going through
those stargates.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of something
that people don't like to hear.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:84%
They want to take this
flesh bag with them.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
I can't fathom

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that, of why you would
want to spend eternity

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:90%
in one of these things.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
There are many
other ways that we

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.660 align:middle line:84%
can express ourselves and
travel throughout the universe.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
This just happens
to be one of them.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And what my research
shows is that it's

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
going to take a lot of
effort to get one of these

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to go through one
of these stargates,

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
contrary to the military
version put forward

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
in "Contact" and
"Stargate" and other TV

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:90%
shows that reflect this.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.065 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
we're going to be

00:18:59.065 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
sending Bradley tanks through
stargates anytime soon, OK?

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.912 align:middle line:90%
But it's a possibility.

00:19:04.912 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about here
is of the ultimate expression

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of the phrase, walk
on water, which

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
is an alternative title
for my presentation.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about walking on water,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about performing
the ultimate miracle--

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the transfiguration of
ourselves into a being of light

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and walking the water of the
stars, the heavenly realm,

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
the waters of creation
as light being.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to walk
on water as flesh beings.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:10%
It's going to require
this transfiguration

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:10%
or metamorphosis.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, I suggest,
as Saint Francis of Assisi

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:10%
said that, "What we're looking
for is what is looking."

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about connecting
with our Higher Self.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Or Higher Self is
looking for us, as well.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about the
unity of heaven and earth here.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
About truly becoming all
that we can be as, in fact,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:90%
star beings.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I was headed to Florida
to a 2012 event.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And the producer
called me and said,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Penn & Teller want to
come interview you.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:84%
They have that show
called, "Bullshit."

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
come talk to you.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And John Major Jenkins
and Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
John's one of the great 2012
scholars, and Daniel Pinchbeck,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
he's the Daniel
Pinchbeck of our age.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:90%
These are great writers.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.057 align:middle line:90%
They've got a lot of insight.

00:20:27.057 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But to people like Penn &
Teller, what I just told

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:90%
you is total bullshit.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
To think that you
could conceivably

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
take this piece of
garbage-- from the Christian

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
perspective-- and spin
it into a beam of light,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:90%
that is bullshit.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.171 align:middle line:84%
And so it got me
kind of fired up.

00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I started thinking about this.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like dang.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
What kind of culture
do we live in when

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
you have a bestselling or hit
TV show called, "Bullshit" that

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
makes fun of things
like recycling,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance, any kind
of spiritual capacity

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
To a certain perspective on this
planet, that's just total BS.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a nonstarter
and they just want

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to make fun of these
kinds of concepts.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.795 align:middle line:84%
If you think that's
productive, hey.

00:21:08.795 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I've got something for you.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:90%
So what I did is, I sat down.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.588 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know.

00:21:12.588 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
What I want to talk
about is holy shit.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.255 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:90%
We're in a transition right now.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Our world is like that cocoon
transforming or metamorphosing

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:90%
thing into a butterfly.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody feels
something's going on.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
We could be that
acorn that's actually

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
destroying its identity
in order to become an oak.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But there is no vision
for an oak on this planet.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
We're not all going
through our present crises

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
on this planet
knowing that we're

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:90%
growing towards something.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't have those kind
of visionaries in our world

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
At least none that
are on the TV screen,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
especially on
"Showtime" and shows

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
like "Bullshit" and
everything else.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Shit's flying
everywhere right now.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Politically, financially,
environmentally, spiritually,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
it's a fucking shit
storm out there.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, are
we totally screwed or what?

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
important question.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
For me, holy shit
is our only hope.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get back to what is
truly holy and sacred about us.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Contact with higher
beings is imminent.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Physics is proving the
existence of other dimensions

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
and opening black holes.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:90%
We're morphing.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:84%
We have a confluence of
technology going on right now

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that is directed
right at our bodies,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:84%
where we are morphing
into cyborgs right

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.280 align:middle line:90%
before our very eyes.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.239 align:middle line:84%
Walk through any
shopping mall or airport,

00:22:33.239 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
you see the people with
the Bluetooth hanging out

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:90%
of their ear.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We are morphing into cyborgs,
which could be a prison

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:90%
path, in my opinion.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
In every major
technology sector,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the impossible
becoming possible right now.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Invisibility, done.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Teleportation, near done.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Regeneration of
our bodies through

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:90%
stem cell research, done.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
We are, in every
way, shape, and form

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
redefining what it means
to be human at this moment.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:84%
A new artificially
intelligent internet matrix

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:90%
went online on October 3rd.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called the grid.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's 10,000 times faster
than the current internet.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs and
everybody can't wait

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to plug your body into
that thing as an iBod.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to go
from wearable computing

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:84%
to inside the skin with all of
us connected to this grid that

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:90%
is artificially intelligent.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And you will not be able to
distinguish this grid from God,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.636 align:middle line:90%
unless you're not in it.

00:23:32.636 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There's unprecedented
discoveries

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
being made about outer
space, inner space, and even

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:90%
our souls.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Oprah has opened the door
to a new consciousness.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
She's got the Church
of Oprah open.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Nashville girl.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Proud of her.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:90%
She's making it happen.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And she's asking us to become
more holy and, well, whole.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But not religious,
because that's bullshit.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We know that religion is dead
because religions have not

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:90%
served us.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
They brought us to a place now
of complete and ardor chaos.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.885 align:middle line:84%
October 1st, some say a
coup took place in America.

00:24:05.885 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
paranoid people,

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.385 align:middle line:90%
well, they're not paranoid.

00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Just perceptive people
like Naomi Wolf.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:84%
They say there was a coup
in America on October 1st

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:90%
when the financial crisis hit.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And what happened during
that coup is suddenly

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
you have a president that
now has his own treasury.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
He has his own
private army, called

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Blackwater, that is operating
in the United States.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
As Naomi Wolf outlines,
there are 10 classic steps

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
towards fascism
or a police state.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And she has checked off
every single one of them.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:90%
We now live in a police state.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Enjoying yourself?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Having a good time?

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.521 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this what we all hoped
and prayed for at this time?

00:24:48.521 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: It's bullshit.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
WILLIAM HENRY: It's bullshit,
is absolutely right.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:90%
You got that right.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
My friend, David Icke,
talks about this.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Is the fulfillment finally
of the Orwellian ideal

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
superimpose on this planet.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:90%
You are now a prisoner.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, John McCain was heard
in one of his campaign speeches

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.327 align:middle line:90%
saying, my fellow prisoners.

00:25:12.327 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that was
a slip of the tongue.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I think what that was is that's
his subconscious just coming

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
right out, saying we are,
in fact, in a prison planet

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's less than five
years before you're

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
going to reach out
your hand willingly

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and say, put that
chip in me, baby.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Give it to me.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to
make it so attractive.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And the second you do that,
your definition of God,

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
your definition of who you are,
everything instantly changes.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:90%
But we do have a choice.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:90%
David Icke.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.737 align:middle line:84%
I love the cover of
his new presentation.

00:25:42.737 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:10%
He's got the golden eye up here.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Symbolic of big brother.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.081 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
talk about big brother.

00:25:47.081 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:90%
That makes me depressed.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that puts
some adrenaline

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
going through my body that
I don't like to be there.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:90%
It's called fear.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
There's another fear in
our world these days.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I to focus
on is the other aspect

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
of the golden eye, which is
about how to access our higher

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, how to feed
ourselves spiritually,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.815 align:middle line:84%
and how to become beings
that don't need to be chipped

00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and plugged into a grid,
and controlled by who

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:84%
knows what freak
and whatever power

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%
center around this planet.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.262 align:middle line:84%
As Naomi Wolf says, "we need
millions of people rising up."

00:26:20.262 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:90%
she's calling for revolution.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's go arrest the president
because he's the one who

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:90%
initiated this coup.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a bit extreme.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.526 align:middle line:90%
It may come to that.

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:31.025 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm thinking
is we actually

00:26:31.025 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:84%
need millions of
people morphing.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:84%
We need millions of people
that subscribe to a higher

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.540 align:middle line:84%
ideal, that get themselves
out of this prison

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, this
prisoner consciousness

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
the reason we're here

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
is to do the heavy work
of transforming ourselves

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
into light beings.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And this all begins
with just one decision.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:55.095 align:middle line:84%
That's all we have to
make is one decision.

00:26:55.095 --> 00:26:55.595 align:middle line:90%
