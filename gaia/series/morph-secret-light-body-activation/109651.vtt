00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:03.928 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's talk for a moment
here about the journey

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that we're all on.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I subtitled this "Earth
is a Rehab Planet,"

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're all here
to learn something.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And as I expressed
earlier, I think

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
we're all here to learn how
to become beings of greater

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:90%
love as opposed to fear.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite frescoes.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It's from Italy.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I call it "The
Bridge to Eternity."

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It shows a group
of people here that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:84%
are in various stages of
ascension, and all of us

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
are somewhere in this
picture, I believe.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Likely, we're past
these guys here,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
who are just beginning
their journey, who

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to scale the
ladder, who are beginning

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:90%
to raise their frequency.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're turning
back to their loved ones

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hey, I'm
going to Nashville.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Going to Nashville to do what?

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Talk about stargates and
wormholes and transfiguration?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.176 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all said
goodbye to our friends,

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and now we're on our
journey, and we're

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:90%
helping one another along here.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why these
events to me are

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
so special, is because
we're all in this together.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I love that
Hollywood expression,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
"nobody knows nothing."

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows nothing.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:84%
What that means in
Hollywood is nobody knows

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
what movie is going to work.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:90%
You just gotta do it, right?

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:90%
William Goldman said that.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the great
Hollywood screenwriters.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I took that and
modified it and said,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:90%
everybody knows something.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I've got a little piece,
you've got a little piece,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
we're all coming together
to make this work

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%
and helping each other across.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That's me right there,
showing my ass to everybody.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm just about halfway across.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, why are
you listening to me?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get myself
upright here, right?

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
But we all do become upright.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.845 align:middle line:84%
We become upright,
we become immovable.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
We become these beings who
are capable of stabilizing

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
this frequency of love
and bliss within us.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And what that
enables us to do is

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to reach out and get that
and that's on the other side.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
We all know that
that hand is there.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
We need to reach out to it and
bring that higher energy in,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.265 align:middle line:84%
because that's what helps
us get across this bridge,

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately helps us to
fulfill our destiny as well.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
My favorite guy in this painting
are these guys down here.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
This guy down here on the bottom
left who's just looking up,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:90%
going, thank you, thank you.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to go back.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.175 align:middle line:90%
I made it, I did it.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I got the interview, I got the
job, I'm on the other side.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.105 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to commence
my next level of work.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And as we all know, the
work that we're doing,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
the ladder we're scaling
is the stairway to heaven.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey back to the
stars, back to the place

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:90%
that we came from.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
One of these
hundreds of billions

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies that exist within
the known universe, which

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
is about 10%, we believe, of
what is actually out there.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of these galaxies is
actually home for some of us

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, but we're living
in such a blessed time

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to be able to perceive
these galaxies at this time,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and I believe are
we perceive them

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
because we know
we came from them,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and we're ultimately
returning to these places,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're working together
to gather that knowledge

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and return to the stars.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:84%
My first book was called
"Junior Cosmic Egg."

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It looks like I drew
that in first grade,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
but actually I drew this
when I was about 30.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I had read Raymond Moody's
book on the interlife,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and it prompted me to ask.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.557 align:middle line:84%
It's like, where do I
go in between lifetimes?

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Where do we spend our interlife?

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with the
story of a cosmic egg named

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Junior who wanted to grow up
to become his own universe.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
This is junior's
parents, Benny and Holly.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Benny was part of the
greatest rock and roll

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:90%
band ever in the universe.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
He and his band
travelled throughout,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:90%
rocking the universe.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And then Benny met Holly,
and it was all over with.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Quit the band,
moved to Manhattan,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
decided what he wanted to do
was just raise a cosmic egg.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So Benny and Holly waited
beside the river of life.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:84%
All the galaxies went
flying by, and they

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
waited and waited until one day
came the time for the green ray

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:90%
to emerge.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.405 align:middle line:84%
Junior went through the
stargate, the wormhole,

00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:90%
and was finally born.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Junior Cosmic Egg
started his quest

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
to become his own universe.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And that archetypal drama,
that's the one that all of us

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:90%
are on.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're all on this
journey of perfection.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.607 align:middle line:84%
We're all cosmic eggs who want
to become our own universe.

00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, one of the
most valuable things

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I ever learned in my
mythological study

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
comes from Joseph Campbell.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
He had gone into
the ancient myths

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and came up with this list
of the 12 step process

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that we all undergo as
we begin our journey

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately end with the
celebration and perfection.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:90%
This is 12 steps.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call
Earth a rehab planet.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.485 align:middle line:10%
We all begin with the one, the
pure place, with the source,

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:10%
with the mother.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But we can't stay there, because
our soul gets to the call

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.197 align:middle line:90%
to adventure.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
In order for our soul's growth,
we have to leave the one

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and come out into the
world, into the universe,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.706 align:middle line:90%
to grow as beings.

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So we get that
call to adventure,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and then we select our missions.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:10%
We work with our
guides, or higher self,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:10%
and select the mission.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:10%
What do we hope to accomplish
in a particular incarnation

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:10%
or incarnations?

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:10%
Then we cross the threshold.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It could be a journey
across the galaxy,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and then we experience
a period of incubation

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:90%
in the birth portal.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
After we're born, after we
leave our mother's womb,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
welcome to the Earth
School of Ascension,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
which I call Stargate U, because
that's what it's all about.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Where we encounter tests
and allies and enemies,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
all designed to help
us to perfect ourselves

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and achieve our soul's
ultimate capability.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:10%
At some point, we
enter the inmost cave.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Which be a room like this, a
cave-like room where we're all

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:10%
looking at images
on the screen here,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:10%
bringing those images into us.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we all experience
the supreme ordeal.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
That usually happens after
you leave this event.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.432 align:middle line:84%
People ask you, what did
William Henry have to say?

00:06:28.432 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:90%
He talked about this and this.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the supreme ordeal,
explaining what we all

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:90%
went through this weekend.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:90%
But then we get the reward.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:10%
We start to think about it.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:10%
Things start to sink in.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.991 align:middle line:84%
Before we know it, we're
putting new pieces together,

00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:90%
having a higher understanding.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
We get the reward
from that return,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's when we
experience the celebration.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately what
we're looking for

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate celebration
known as the perfection, where

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
we finally perfect ourselves.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:84%
The 12 labors of Hercules
are another manifestation

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
of this journey that
we all must accomplish.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Various mythological
systems talk about this.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.305 align:middle line:84%
I want to interject a little
bit of Jordan Maxwell.

00:07:12.305 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
This is Jordan and I
at the Great Pyramid.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Jordan had done some amazing
work on the ancient esoteric

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
or occult secrets of
commerce and how they relate

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:90%
to this concept of sovereignty.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
What Jordan discovered is that
we're all fish out of water,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and he found that the metaphor
of the soul as a fish out

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
of water is carried
over into what

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is called the law of the
sea, the manufactured

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
law or manufacturer's law
of the waters or the sea.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:90%
It's also called maritime law.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And as Jordan describes, this
is opposed to natural law.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Natural law is what
goes up must come down.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And superimposed over our
reality is this maritime law.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And here's how it works,
according to Jordan.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
He notes that all ships,
from sailing two rocket,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:90%
are considered to be female.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
The mother in this scheme
is the merchant vessel.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
This, for example, is when
Mary is called the Ark.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
She delivers the cargo, the
goods, the God, the living God,

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:90%
or the goods, Jesus.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The instant the mother's
water breaks in the delivery

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
room, notes Jordan, and her
cargo descends the birth

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
canal, the newborn baby--
the newly manifested body,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
or cargo-- comes
under the jurisdiction

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
of earthly maritime law.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And waiting for that cargo in
the delivery room, the birth,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
or the doctor, is a
state-licensed doctor

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
who examines the manifest
being and certifies live birth.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
As Jordan describes
it, this is sort

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
of like when a ship
comes into port,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:84%
you've got a guy
there that's waiting

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
to examine that ship,
take a look at its cargo,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:90%
writes a manifest.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happens when
we enter into this world.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
A doctor is waiting, and a
certificate of live birth,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
or manifest, is
written itemizing

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
the details of the
docking at the birth,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
as well as the condition of
the cargo for presentation

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:90%
to officials.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
How much does it
weigh, how long is it,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
is it male or female,
and also it asks what is

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:90%
the occupation of the parents.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, who cares what the
occupation parents are?

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people
care, because this

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:90%
is all about commerce for them.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And they view our body as
a manufactured product that

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, owned by somebody.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.529 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
manifest, notes Jordan,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.944 align:middle line:84%
because the ship that
brought it in appeared.

00:09:44.944 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't there
the night before.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
It manifested in the morning,
so they call it a manifest.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing when the
baby comes into the world.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:90%
We manifest in this world.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The human body is considered an
energy vessel, like a battery.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Energy is stored
in our fat cells.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It's emitted from her heart in
the form of emotional energy.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
There's also fear energy
that comes from our body,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and this is the key point here.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Manifestation of this
liquid crystal standing

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
wave that is the human
biological transformational

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
apparatus is strictly
regulated on Earth,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
since we're deemed to be
owned property by somebody.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
They own us, they regulate
what goes in our mouth

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and what comes out of our body.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I can't say shit,
piss, fuck, cock, cocksucker,

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
motherfucker, or asshole
on the radio or TV

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is because they all refer
to the excretory functions

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:90%
of our body.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
God forbid we start talking
about that in public,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
because then we're just
one step away from talking

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
about the secretory functions
of the pineal gland.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to think
of our body as capable

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:90%
of manufacturing stuff.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is taboo
in our society,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is why, because
you've got to really believe

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that your body is a filthy,
disgusting piece of garbage

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that's got to be
deodorized, it's

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
got to be cleansed and
purified in a certain way,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and only certain things
can go in your mouth

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:90%
or come out of your mouth.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything is tightly
regulated, and the reason why

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is because ultimately the
people who are regulating it

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
know about the energy
capabilities of this body

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and what it is truly
capable of doing,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and it must therefore
be controlled.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And you must be, from the
time you're this high,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
told that this
body serves really

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
no function from a higher
spiritual perspective

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.171 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
everything that

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the front of
your body is consider holy.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
If it comes out of the back
of your body, it's waste.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
worry about it.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:90%
The toll.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Earth's monetary
system is based on

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
this ancient esoteric
concept of the human body

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
as an energy system or a
device, a manufacturing plant

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:84%
capable of manufacturing
incredible oils

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and secretions that can, in
fact, transmute the body.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
As Jordan notes,
the entire system

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
is set up to
extract money, which

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
is energy, which is current
or currency from your body.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we used such terms

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
as are you current
with your bills.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's all based
on the electrical nature

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of our body and the principle
that our body is a manufactured

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:84%
item that is controlled
and regulated,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and is being, in fact,
harvested by a group of beings.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The Church, Jordan notes,
is also under this system.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
This explains why Christianity
is divided into denominations.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Five, tens, fifties,
twenties, hundreds, Lutherans,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Episcopalians, yada,
yada, yada, There's

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.770 align:middle line:84%
over 300 denominations
of Christianity.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:90%
What is money?

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Money is energy.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Where did the symbol
for money come from?

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:10%
The symbol for money
ultimately came

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:10%
from Moses, who lifted
the serpent with the rod.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:10%
It's also a Gnostic symbol.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:10%
The Gnostics used the symbol
of the serpent winding its way

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:10%
up the pillar as the symbol for
Christ, the ultimate energy,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:10%
the highest spiritual energy.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:90%
This symbol is now demonized.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:10%
That's demonized, but
that is a good symbol.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:10%
You want to worship
this, but don't dare talk

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:10%
about worshiping Christ
as a serpent of energy

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:10%
or as a higher vibration.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:90%
This is taboo.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.132 align:middle line:90%
This is our God.

00:13:45.132 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It should be the
other way around.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Somebody switched it.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:10%
To the ancient
Egyptians, the body

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:10%
is a receiver or
transmitter of Sekhem,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:10%
or life force
energy, the exousia.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is the concept
that we've gotten away from.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Someone has stepped in and
manipulated this system,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and understands that this body
is a receiver and a transmitter

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.022 align:middle line:90%
that can transmit fear energy.

00:14:11.022 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And the theory that we're
going to develop here

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a race of
beings that harvest this fear

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
energy from our
bodies, and who knows,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
they might sell it
like crack cocaine

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
in regions of the galaxy where
fear simply doesn't exist.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
You've heard Alex
Jones another's

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about Earth as a plantation
planet, as a fear farm,

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly playing
into this scenario here,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and this is the research that
Jordan began a long time ago.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm trying
to do is take it now

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and say that's a basic
platform for this,

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
but there's a whole
'nother dynamic to this,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.871 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
going to look at now.

00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>And a transition of it.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Pardon me?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>And a transition of it.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>And a transition of it, yeah.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to each,
you see over and over

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:84%
again depictions of the body
that resemble of a battery.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a body in a
Tet pillar as it's

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
called, a power pillar with two
angels on either side that are

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:90%
beaming energy to that figure.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a
representation of Osiris.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
When Osiris is raised, he is
shown inside the Tet pillar.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And what's intriguing about this
is that in various symbol books

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll be shown that the four
cross bars of the Tet pillar

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
are equivalent to
the floor cross

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
bars of the Christian cross,
which is very interesting.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
This is how the Egyptians
thought of the body.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Fully functioning body had
the Tet, or powerful pillar,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
the key of life,
and was connected

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%
to the source of light.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
That's our goal, is to
unite male and female

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and be one with the
light, be a transmitter

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
or receiver of the highest
possible frequency.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
By the way, each
human cell is said

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to have about 1.7 volts
of electrical potential.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Multiply this by the
estimated one quadrillion

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
cells in the human body, and
the total electrical potential

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.085 align:middle line:84%
of the human body equals
about 1.7 quadrillions volts.

00:16:04.085 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of energy.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
If this potential was
tapped simultaneously,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
coherently, it could
create a brilliant flash

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
of light, which might be one
of the explanations for how

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
the image on the Shroud of
Turin which was created, when

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.405 align:middle line:84%
a man coherently
raised his vibration

00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and beamed himself
through that linen shroud.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and Mary Magdalene
talked extensively

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
about this predicament.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Extensively.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
In the Hypostasis
of the Archons,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
for example, one of
the Gnostic gospels

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that was found at
Nag Hammadi, which

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
is within walking
distance of Abydos,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
we learned that the evil archons
clothed man in a material

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:90%
body, a casket, or a tomb.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They contrived to keep Adam and
Eve, along with their divine

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
sparks or particles,
trapped in matter,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.540 align:middle line:84%
enslaved forever in the
wheel of reincarnation,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:84%
or reincarceration, as
tillers of the Garden of Eden.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Various Gnostic
scholars like John Lash

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
believe that these images
that are in the Iraqi National

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Museum, which bear great
resemblance to what

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
we think of as reptilians,
actually representations

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:90%
are the archons.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
These statues are
5,000 years old.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
I found it interesting
that after we looted

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the Iraqi National
Museum and they finally

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
put their website back up, these
were the first images that they

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.125 align:middle line:90%
put back up on their site.

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hmm, there's
a message there.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
In the First
Apocalypse of James,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says the archons are
like toll collectors who

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
seek to take by theft
our divine spark.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that "by
theft" has something

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.249 align:middle line:90%
to do with alien abduction.

00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:43.665 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
good possibility.

00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:10%
They are not entirely
alien, says Jesus.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:10%
They are from
Achamoth, and these she

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:10%
produced as she brought down the
race from the Pre-Existent One.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
The Pre-Existent
One is another word

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:90%
for the Adamantine Reality.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So then Jesus concludes by
saying they're not alien,

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
but they're ours, leading
to the interpretation

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that these beings are
kind of like our cousins.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:90%
They've gone a little bit crazy.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:90%
They're jealous of us.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:84%
We have a divine
spark, they don't, they

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
want to take ours by theft.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So they've contrived this
whole system in order

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
to harvest this energy
from us along the way.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
These archons were later
transformed into the devils

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:90%
by the Church.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And you see these guys are kind
of reptilian-looking, really

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
kind of interesting-looking
depictions.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
This is Saint Michael
with the dragon.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.027 align:middle line:84%
And they present them as
quite scary-looking beings,

00:18:42.027 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Very, again, reptilian-looking.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And you see why I'm
talking about David Icke

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:90%
kind of paranoia here.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:90%
There's more to it than this.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.579 align:middle line:84%
Jane Schaberg was a professor
of religious studies--

00:18:55.579 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
is a professor of Religious
Studies and Women's Studies

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Detroit Mercy,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and she provides one of the
most interesting insights

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
into Mary Magdalene in
her book "The Resurrection

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%
of Mary Magdalene."

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
She notes that Migdol or
Magdala has a very high place

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
in women's mystical a literary
traditions for its connections

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to the Daughters of
Job who lived there.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:10%
Specifically, she says
Magdala was involved

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:10%
with Merkabah mysticism.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:10%
And the way I interpret this,
it's kind of like saying Alice

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.370 align:middle line:10%
was from Wonderland today.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.329 align:middle line:10%
If I tell you that if
Alice is from Wonderland,

00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:33.036 align:middle line:10%
you automatically get
the idea that she's

00:19:33.036 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:10%
from an other-dimensional
realm, or she

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.601 align:middle line:10%
knows how to toggle back and
forth between the worlds.

00:19:37.601 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
At the time of Jesus and Mary
Magdalene, all they had to say

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
was that she was
from Magdala, and it

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.255 align:middle line:84%
was understood that that
was a school or a place

00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
where Merkabah
mysticism was taught

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and very well understood.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:54.036 align:middle line:84%
In this Testament of Job is
some very interesting references

00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:90%
to the archons.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It says that in
all the land, there

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:84%
were no women as beautiful
as Job's daughters.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Dove, Cinnamon, and
the Horn of Kohl

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
were the meanings
of their names.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
These three daughters had an
extraordinary experience when

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:90%
their father Job was dying.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:10%
He called his daughter
to his death bed

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:10%
and said, take the signet
ring, go to the chamber,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:10%
and bring me three
golden boxes so that I

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:10%
may give you an inheritance.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:10%
And she went away
and brought them,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:10%
and he opened them up and
brought forth three bands,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:10%
three rays, shimmering so
that no man could describe

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:10%
their form, since they are not
from Earth, but from heaven,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:10%
flashing with bright sparks
like rays of the sun.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
What where these three bands,
these three shimmering rings?

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:10%
One of Job's daughters
complains of this

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:10%
isn't much by way
of an inheritance.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We won't be able to sustain
our life from them, will we?

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Job's response is
really incredible.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Not only will you
sustain life from these three

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:84%
bands, but they will also
lead you into the better world

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:90%
to live in the heavens."

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.685 align:middle line:84%
So remember the three
stars, the three rays

00:21:05.685 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that we've been looking at
in various symbolism here?

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
we're talking about here.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according
to Job, the Lord

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:90%
had given him these three cords.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
When Day, his first
daughter, put on the cord,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:90%
she went out of her body.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
She put out a new
heart and never

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:90%
again cared for earthly things.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Then she sang angelic hymns
in the language of the angels.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Her sister's heart
was also transformed

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.916 align:middle line:84%
the moment she put on this
sash, or cord, or ray.

00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
She too no longer wished
for worldly things,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and when she opened
her mouth, she suddenly

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
spoke the language of the
rulers, of the archons.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The Hypostasis of
the Archons again

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
says that these archons
are our not enemy,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:90%
but they're here to test us.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn about these
guys so that we can evade them,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
because they want to take
this divine spark from us.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:13.512 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.512 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
third daughter puts

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
on the band is her
heart is changed,

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
she goes out of her
body, and she too

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
learns the language
of the archons.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And the idea here is
that Mary Magdalene,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:84%
as a child of Magdala,
one of these women

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
who knew the Merkabah
mysticism, must have

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
known all of those things, too.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're asked
to infer from this.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So we go to the
gospel of Philip,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
we have another
conversation presented here,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
another of the Gnostic gospels
and other Nag Hammadi scrolls,

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and it says, the Archons
wanted to fool us,

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
since they saw we were
connected with the good.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They took the names of the good
and gave to them the not good.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, and gave
them to the not good.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.442 align:middle line:84%
So with names, they could trick
and rope us to the not good.

00:23:06.442 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:10%
A switch was pulled.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:10%
As though doing us a favor, they
took names from the not good

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:10%
and placed them on the good.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they were doing.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to grab
those of us who are free

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.055 align:middle line:90%
and make us eternal slaves.

00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Continuing on in the
gospel of Philip,

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
it says the rulers do not see
you who wear the perfect light,

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.881 align:middle line:90%
and they cannot seize you.

00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
You put on the light in
the mystery of union,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:90%
says the gospel of Philip.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So here, we are told
in the gospel of Philip

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:84%
the reason why we want
to become perfect.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's so that never again we'll
be enslaved by the archons.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
No longer will our energy be
harvested by these beings.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
We will be able to go
into the eternal realms.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we're asked
to consider from all

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
this is that there is a race of
beings on this planet that are

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:90%
pulling the gears behind us.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
They're creating a matrix
of fear on this planet,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and they have every one
of us in that matrix

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and our harvesting
from our bodies

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:90%
an energy or a vibration.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Who knows for sure what
they're doing with it,

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.680 align:middle line:84%
but the Gnostic gospels maintain
that the only way for us

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to escape this predicament
is to become perfect,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
because if we're perfect,
the archons can't see us.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that this should give
us extra motivation, especially

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
at this time when there seems to
be a ramping up of this agenda

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
to keep a sense of fear and to
literally further enslave us.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time when
we've got to begin

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
absorbing this energy of
the purifying energies

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and take ourselves
out of this system.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I think when we go back to
ancient Egypt and to Seti,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
we get more clues about
how this was done,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and how we can bring
it into our bodies.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
This is Seti here
with the Tet pillar.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
He's handing the
Tet pillar to Isis.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Then he sets the pillar
upright-- remember,

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.840 align:middle line:90%
this is a power pillar.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
This is Seti standing
before that Tet pillar

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.105 align:middle line:84%
with the symbols of new
clothes in his hand.

00:25:20.105 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
he has the symbol

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:90%
for the light body in his hand.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Gnostics
maintain that there

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:90%
was a switch that was pulled.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:84%
The good became the not good,
the not good became the good.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the other great switches
that was pulled, to me,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
symbols that we use,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
key symbols that I

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
like to reference
in this regard here

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is what we do with our
children on Easter morning.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
We take them to church
on Easter morning,

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:84%
before we take them to
church, we very often

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:90%
will dress them in new clothes.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
This tradition of putting
our children new clothes

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
or wearing new clothes
at Easter comes back here

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Egypt,
when it was understood

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that the new clothes
that we put on

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:84%
are actually the
clothing woven of light

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:90%
that is our light body.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Today it tells us when we
put our kids in new clothes,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
it tells us exactly
how far we are away

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
from the original
conception of these ideas

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and suggests that there was
indeed a switch that was made.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So here's Seti giving the
symbol of the new clothes

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to the Tet pillar, receiving
the energy from it,

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
because once again
it is a power pillar.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:90%
And here it is set upright.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
He became a fully
functioning human being.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
He was able to
escape this matrix

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:84%
by perfecting himself, and
then teleporting himself

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:90%
into a better place.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Coptic
church in-- in

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian Christian
church in Aswan, Egypt,

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.365 align:middle line:84%
and I took this photograph
of Jesus with the cross.

00:26:50.365 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said wait a minute, look
at the way this is portrayed.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:84%
This looks like something I've
just seen just a moment ago.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
When we go back over
here to Abydos with Seti,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:84%
we see Seti holding the
Tet pillar at an angle

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and handing it to Isis.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.035 align:middle line:84%
This is Jesus carrying
the Cross at an angle,

00:27:11.035 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and as I mentioned a moment
ago, numerous symbol books

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that the
four cross arms of the Tet

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
pillar in Egypt became
the four cross bars

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Christian cross.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But what Christianity
omitted in the big switch

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.420 align:middle line:84%
was the technology
that was involved,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and how the cross
isn't something

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
a single guy carries and
dies for your sins and all

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that whole story
that they concocted.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
This is something you are
supposed to do for yourself.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to activate
these latent capabilities

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:84%
within your own body, carry
the cross, so to speak,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
lift your energy, your
vibration, and that

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
will carry you across
and out of this realm.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no question to me
that Jesus was at Abydos

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and learned the secrets of
transfiguration at that place,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's why this
symbolism matches.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But again, what is omitted
is the source here.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the big switch that
the Church made, giving you

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:84%
a hollow teaching that
lets you mindlessly

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
follow a pope into literally
oblivion or further slavery

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
at the hands of what might be
a race of beings that certainly

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
do not have our best intentions,
or our highest good, in mind.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So over and again,
you see Jesus carrying

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
this instrument
that is presented

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:90%
as an instrument of torture.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that way at all.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
This was an instrument
of divine energy.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It was the way in which
we can raise our frequency

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and vibration and
become godlike beings.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Seti in
front of the Tet pillar,

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is a depiction
of the crucifixion

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that I've found that I thought
was strikingly similar.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Are both somewhat
phallic shape-looking,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:84%
both are golden, and chose
the man in the cross here.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a painting
by a painter named Manetti,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and what it shows is
the stigmatization

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:90%
of Saint Catherine of Siena.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:84%
What's so amazing
about this painting

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:84%
is that Saint Catherine received
the stigmata in beams of light

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:90%
that came from this painting.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
She linked her consciousness
with that painting,

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and out of it came shooting
these rays of light

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that enter her body and
cause the stigmata to occur.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
profound technology

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're describing
there, because what

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:84%
the ancients believed is that
artwork such as this and such

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
as what we see at Abydos
was capable of transmitting

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to you directly exactly
what's in the painting.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:84%
When the icon makers made their
images of the transfiguration,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:84%
they used sayings, Gnostic
sayings, like the image

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.940 align:middle line:84%
itself will show you the
way, enter through the image.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Because what they believed
is that images such as this,

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.310 align:middle line:84%
images of power could
directly transmit to you

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.237 align:middle line:84%
all of the energy that you
needed for your body, which

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:84%
naturally knows how
to do all of this,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.670 align:middle line:90%
to start making it happen.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happened
with Saint Catherine.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:84%
She became devoted to this
painting mentally, physically,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, and
emotionally, and she

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:84%
describes how these rays of
light came out of the painting

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and entered into her body.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely incredible.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So I have a brief
meditation here.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.340 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to share it,
you can close your eyes.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.930 align:middle line:84%
It'll help us to kind
of envision this,

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:90%
bring it into your body.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So with your eyes
closed, let's once again

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:90%
connect with our divine spark.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And now, envision within,
or behind your heart,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
the image of the spiritual sun
and gather yourself into it,

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and let your whole
mind and body be

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.535 align:middle line:84%
filled with this
impeccable light presence.

00:31:07.535 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And from within the sun in
your heart, see a ray of light

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:84%
shoot forth and magically
appear in the space before you.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:10%
It's the image of the Risen One.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:10%
This figure's robe
is white brilliance,

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.105 align:middle line:10%
and its body shines
like sunlight.

00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:10%


00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Now see, feel, or otherwise
experience this being's smile

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.730 align:middle line:10%
upon you, and bless you.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And note that white
light, the white light

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is actually brilliant,
translucent rainbow light.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And now envision this
being blessing you

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:10%
as streams of light pouring
out of its heart upon you.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Make your body, your heart,
and your mind shine together,

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.616 align:middle line:10%
brighter and brighter, like
the image in front of you.

00:32:00.616 --> 00:32:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And now open your
mind, heart, and life

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:84%
completely to the loving
presence of this being that

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
has come out from within you,
making yourself completely

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:90%
transparent before it.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And now shift your
awareness to a point

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:84%
just above the top of your head,
and envision this divine image

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:90%
of this light.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Imagine this divine light
being dissolving into a radiant

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
display of fluid light, pouring
down into you through the crown

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:84%
center on the top of
your head and reappearing

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.580 align:middle line:90%
in your own body of light.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And tune this elixir, tune
the essence of pure love.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And now see the being's
hands as hands of light,

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and see it lay its hands on
you, reaching into your body

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.460 align:middle line:84%
with its hands of light and
beaming healing light flowing

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Your body fills with
golden light, healing you.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:84%
This golden light is
within you and around you,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.262 align:middle line:84%
sealing you in the
divine presence.

00:33:19.262 --> 00:33:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And when this being
removes its hands,

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:84%
listen to what the divine
presence instructs you to do.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Listen for a word or a
message, and give thanks.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:38.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you're
ready, open your eyes.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:90%
