[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>But at the same time, we
live during the greatest

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
spiritual moment of all time,
a time when the impossible

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.511 align:middle line:90%
becomes possible.

00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I always refer people to Jesus'
statement on the impossible.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:84%
He says, I tell you the truth,
it's hard for a rich man

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
to enter the kingdom of
heaven, which in our context

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
here are these other dimensions
beyond our three-dimensional

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:90%
cube that we're in.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, I tell you,
it's easier for a camel

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
eye of a needle

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.512 align:middle line:84%
than for a rich man to
enter the Kingdom of God.

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I get a lot of letters.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:90%
I've talked about this before.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.469 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, you
know, what this really

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
means is that when you enter the
gate of the temple of Jerusalem

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that a camel had to take
all his wares off his back

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and crawl through the
gate on his knees.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.092 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, he couldn't bring
any weapons through the gate.

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Well just like Jesus
didn't come here

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
to teach you to save money
to buy stuff at Walmart,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a whole
other interpretation or layer

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of meaning to this
phrase right here.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
A rich man had asked Jesus what
is required for eternal life.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus replied,
follow the commandments.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:90%
And what are the commandments?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:90%
There's two of them.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The commandments are
love with all your heart,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
with all your mind,
and all your soul.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I took out the Lord
your God, because that's

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
a political statement there at
the time that this was written.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Just love with all your
heart, all your mind,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.099 align:middle line:90%
and all your soul.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the first and
greatest commandment.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And the second is like unto it--
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
All the law, all the prophets
hang on these two commandments.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.495 align:middle line:84%
You want eternal life,
there it is right there.

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
These two commandments--
you don't even

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
need the other Ten Commandments
plastered onto your courthouse,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:90%
you just need these two.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.720 align:middle line:84%
As a Christian-based
civilization,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
we should be living our
lives based on this.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:90%
But we're not.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Jesus defined of law
of love another time

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.938 align:middle line:90%
in his famous golden rule.

00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
So in everything,
do unto others what

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
you would have them done
to you, for this sums up

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.441 align:middle line:90%
the law and the prophets.

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:13.954 align:middle line:90%
It's simple, it's easy.

00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just like achieving
the white body.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans imagine
it, believe it, live it.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:90%
What do you live?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Just do unto others as you
would have done unto you.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.339 align:middle line:84%
Love with all your heart,
all your mind, all your soul.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And you will be able to
enter the Kingdom of God.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Until then, just keep
coming round and round

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.440 align:middle line:90%
until you are a being of love.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:84%
The apostle Paul
echoed this principle

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
when he wrote the entire law is
summed up in a single command,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.333 align:middle line:90%
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The rich man told
Jesus, hey, I've

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
always kept the commandments.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Doubt it.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't be asking if he had.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to know what
else was required.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And here Jesus is
extremely specific.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
He says, if thou wilt
be perfect, holy, whole,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
complete-- we know what the
word perfect means now--

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be a light being,
go and sell what you've got,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:84%
give to the poor, and you'll
have treasure in heaven

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.821 align:middle line:90%
and come and follow me.

00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The key term in here,
as I've highlighted,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is he's telling him, if
you want to be perfect,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
in order to enter the Kingdom
of God you've got to be perfect.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is you have to be

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.165 align:middle line:90%
a transfigured light being.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be a
transfigured light being,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to follow just two
simple commandments-- love

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
with all your heart,
all your mind,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:90%
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:90%
It's that easy.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.329 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The motivation for us to obey
these commandments-- and people

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.786 align:middle line:84%
get turned off when you
talk about this stuff,

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
because they've been browbeat
by priests, by pimps,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.029 align:middle line:84%
by politicians, people
that sell this stuff

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and really don't know what
they're talking about.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
They just use these
words, perfect, glory,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
other of these words, without
having any clue what they mean.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But the only reason
to follow this

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
is not out of fear of divine
judgment if you break a rule,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
or that somebody is
going to chastise you.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the only
way, the one and only way

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to achieve spiritual
enlightenment

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and to pass through
the eye of the needle.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And the needle is the
mouth of the wormhole.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
That is the only way you're
getting through there.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm sorry
to people who watch

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
TV shows like "Stargate"
and all of these

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
with this militaristic
view that we're

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:90%
going to find an ancient gate.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean I hope we do, I
really hope that that's real.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you've researched
to this part of it,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
it says it has nothing
to do with that.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
The one and only way we're
going to open these gates

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is by becoming beings of pure
love, period, end of story.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jesus' transfiguration
is the cosmic freedom

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:90%
that all of us share.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
These things that
I do so will you.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And the description
of this event

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
triggers our imagination to
make this a concrete reality

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, to always
choose love over fear.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.414 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus states this directly.

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
He says, isn't it
written into your law.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I said you are gods.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:10%
And the definition of gods
here is a being of pure love

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:26.096 align:middle line:10%
who has graduated
from Stargate U.

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:10%
The Buddhists have a
lot to weigh in on here.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:10%
They teach that you'll
continue to reincarnate

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:10%
until you achieve the
great work, the creation

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.492 align:middle line:10%
of the Golden Star
Body or Body of Light.

00:05:36.492 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:90%
You can take comfort in that.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
It says it's there to be done.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But we'll continue to
reincarnate until we actually

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:90%
achieve this.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
They teach us that
the light body grows

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:90%
with our work or our deeds.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Love your neighbor as
yourself, do unto others.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Your deeds are what
are important here.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Its manifestation marks the end
of work on Earth and release

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.829 align:middle line:84%
from our temporary
exile in this world.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
The powers of the light
body, the Buddhists

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
teach, transfer from
incarnation to incarnation.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:90%
I take a lot of solace in that.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Because while I'm
on a path to making

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
this happen in my
life in this life,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I recognize it might not happen.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
everything I'm doing

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
at this time, this knowledge
I'm accumulating now,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I can take it with me.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I do take it with me.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
If the work remains
unfinished in one incarnation,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
its progress is carried
over into the next

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
with memory of how to
activate these powers.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:90%
The work will continue.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure every one of us has
had a moment of remembrance.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
This resonates,
this makes sense,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been over some
of this before.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I know what this
means, and I know

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
now is the time more than ever
for me to focus and dedicate

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
myself to choosing
love over fear.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.125 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Enoch
says that blessed

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
is the man who does not
direct his heart with malice

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
against any man, and
helps the injured

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.424 align:middle line:84%
and condemned, and
raises the broken down,

00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and shall do charity
to the needy.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Because on the day of
the great judgment,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:84%
every weight, every measure,
and every makeweight

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:90%
will be as in the market.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, they
are hung on the scales

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:90%
and stand in the market.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And every one shall
learn his own measure,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and according to his measure
shall take his reward.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was one of
the starwalkers.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:90%
He absorbed all of this lore.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:90%
He became a starwalker.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's one of the
only starwalkers mentioned

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:90%
in the Old Testament.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Jesus got rid of
that whole paragraph

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and just said, hey, by your
fruits you will know them.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
By your deeds, by what
you do, you will be known.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And what ups the ante here
is that it's by our deeds

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
build our light body.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how we do it.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Imagine it, believe
it, live it, do it.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Paul Newman recently passed.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:10%
Oscar winning actress Sally
Field, who started with Newman,

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.551 align:middle line:10%
said she was blessed
to have known him.

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:10%
And then she said, sometimes
God makes perfect people,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:10%
and Paul Newman was one of them.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, I don't know that Paul
Newman was that perfect.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
He's perfect by
Hollywood standards.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, here's Sally Field
using the classic definition

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.736 align:middle line:90%
of the word perfect.

00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But what happened, when you
look at Paul Newman's story,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.876 align:middle line:84%
is that he says one
day I just woke up.

00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I just woke up one
day with the idea

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
to build some camps called the
Hole in the Wall Gang camps.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And these were camps for
terminally ill children

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:90%
that are now all over the world.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Newman created
a place for these kids

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.495 align:middle line:84%
to come and enjoy themselves
before their passing.

00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
That gives me goose bumps,
because that's something

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:90%
a perfect person would do.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
That's something a person
who's on the path of perfection

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:84%
would do something
just like that.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Newman was
not only perfect

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
from a Hollywood perspective,
in terms of beauty and ability,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
but he also acted
like a perfect being.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.442 align:middle line:90%
He said one day I just woke up.

00:09:05.442 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
He said this is what I
need to do with my life.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
And he did it.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.019 align:middle line:90%
Incredible inspiration.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's not
about how much you love.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about how much
others love you.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Who said that?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
That was The Wizard of Oz.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Even The Wizard of Oz knew that.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.119 align:middle line:84%
When the Tin Man asked for the
heart, The Wizard of Oz says,

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
remember, it's not
about how much you love,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.832 align:middle line:84%
it's about how much
others love you.

00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
How much do others
love Paul Newman

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.826 align:middle line:84%
for setting up the Hole
in the Wall Gang camps?

00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, wow, think about that.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:90%
What a lasting legacy.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
People will continue to
love Paul Newman for that.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:84%
That's just one example, one
thing that one person did.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right
to this right here.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
They call this a koan.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a riddle.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:10%
The koan-- is a heart
judged by how deeply you

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:10%
are loved by others, or
is the depth of your love

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:10%
the true measure of a heart?

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
This is an important
question for us.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Because as Enoch said,
as Jesus said, and is

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians told,
hey, there's going

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to come a time
when your heart is

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be weighed against
the feather of cosmic order

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and cosmic truth.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
If your heart weighs
less than the feathers,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:90%
then you get to go on.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
If not, the Egyptians
tell us there's

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.098 align:middle line:84%
a recycling program
here waiting for us.

00:10:25.098 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
You get to go around and
around, again and again,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
until your heart weighs
less than that feather,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.019 align:middle line:84%
until you know about
the cosmic order.

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
When you know about
the cosmic order,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that it's all about love, then
you can become a cosmic being.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I love Led Zeppelin, especially
Led Zeppelin IV, Black Dog.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
There he is right there.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean that music is
just full of references

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Egyptian
belief and cosmology.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is not to say
that we are inferior

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:90%
because we're still here.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:90%
We're all doing this.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And this just gives us
motivation to enhance our acts,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the
deeds that we're doing

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
are all about achieving that
state where our heart is

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:90%
lighter than a feather.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:10%
And what happens is that
the Egyptians would show

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:10%
the initiate with the feather,
as in this case right here,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:10%
as the token that says,
hey, you're good to go,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:10%
you're ready to rock.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Your heart weighs
less than the feather.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:90%
You are a cosmic being.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.291 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is in
the right place.

00:11:26.291 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:10%
This initiate is on the
craft sailing into this net

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:10%
here, symbolizing the field or
the dimension of the blessed.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
How do we craft that
wormhole-shaped craft?

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We do it with our
deeds, the things

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that we do in this life that
allow us to express love.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
By doing unto others
as we would do unto

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
them and choosing
love over fear.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is meant
by having our heart set

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.506 align:middle line:90%
on heaven, tuned to heaven.

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of
Philip, Mary Magdalene

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is said to be loved by Jesus
more than the other followers.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
People get upset about
this, that Jesus and Mary

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene were married
or a couple and all this.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand that.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean what's the
problem with that?

00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art this past summer.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of
mine, Monica, took me

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to this incredible tapestry.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen it before.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite striking.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It clearly shows
that Jesus and Mary

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene were viewed
by this 16th century

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
designer as a couple.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
They're clearly in love
with one another here,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:90%
or something else is going on.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the most remarkable
takes on Jesus I've ever seen.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Not just because he's
with Mary Magdalene,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
but look at that incredible
corona around his head.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
That's either like looking
into a sacred mushroom, which

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:84%
some people would say
that's what that is,

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
or this is a whole
Buddhist take on Jesus.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
And what is that corona?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.529 align:middle line:90%
What does it symbolize?

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the only other place
I've seen a corona like that

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is in the Transfiguration
images with the open gateway

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:90%
behind Jesus.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a very similar
kind of perspective.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests to me that
Jesus is portrayed in this way

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
because he's got that
cosmic consciousness.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
His heart is set on heaven
and he's got the open gateway

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%
behind him.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
See the similar motif here
in the Transfiguration image

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:90%
we looked at earlier.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Mary
Magdalene says

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that she received a
transmission after Jesus'

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Resurrection, which the
Gospel of Philip says

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:90%
happened before he died.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:90%
We won't go there.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But we will talk about
what was that knowledge

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:90%
that Mary Magdalene possessed.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Jesus transfigures
himself into light,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
is presumably roaming
around the galaxy somewhere,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:84%
comes back to her and gives her
a transmission of knowledge.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I visited my childhood
church this past summer

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and took this photo
of Mary Magdalene,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.431 align:middle line:84%
this photo of an artistic
interpretation of Mary

00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:90%
She holds a scroll in her hand.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:10%
The scroll reads, in the
beginning was the word.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.047 align:middle line:10%
And the word was love.

00:14:12.047 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:10%
In the beginning was love.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:10%
That's all there
is really, is love,

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:10%
until we decide we're going to
parse the universe into love

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:10%
and fear.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene's transmission
concerned the nature

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
of matter, of
love, of salvation,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and of the soul's journey
to the kingdom of light.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what this was all about.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
People get upset
when I say, well,

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene was a
highly educated priestess

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:90%
of the temples of Isis in Egypt.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not by coincidence that
she turns up at Capernaum

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
just when Jesus starts his
whole mission saying he's

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.315 align:middle line:90%
the Messiah and everything.

00:14:44.315 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
She slides right in
there, because she's

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
got vital knowledge that's going
to help him on his mission.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I describe Jesus as Mary
Magdalene's daredevil test

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:90%
pilot.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
She's got all this
knowledge, and she's

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
like, here, honey, do
this, make this happen.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And he does, and he
comes back to her

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:84%
with a report on
exactly what he was

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:84%
able to determine or
ascertain from his journeying

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
in his light body
throughout the galaxies.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And he talks with her
about the kingdom of light.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
When we think of the kingdom
of light, we're thinking stars.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking maybe our local
solar system or something.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear when
you start looking

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
into these Gnostic documents
that they knew a heck of a lot

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
more about even the galaxies
than we ever dreamed

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:90%
of giving them credit for.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Pistis Sophia,
Jesus praises her

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
as one whose heart is
set on heaven's kingdom

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:90%
more than all your brothers.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why Jesus is said to
have loved Mary Magdalene more

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:90%
than all the others.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It's because her heart is
set on heaven's kingdom more

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:90%
than all the others.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:84%
What it means to me
is that Mary Magdalene

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
has her life dedicated not
just to this plane here.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Her heart is set on
the kingdom of light.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Her heart is tuned to
the kingdom of light,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:90%
to an other dimensional realm.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he loves
her more than the others,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:90%
because she gets it.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:90%
She gets it.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't see herself
just as this flesh bag.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:84%
She knows about
the divine spark.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:84%
She has her heart set on
bringing into her being

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:90%
higher dimensional energies.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And here I have her
in the Tower of Osiris

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
channeling energy from
the Milky Way itself.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Peter and Andrew
doubted that Mary could

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:90%
receive a special revelation.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Levi answered, saying to Peter,
Peter you're always angry.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Go found the Catholic church
so that in 2008 the pope

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
can say I'm
proclaiming sainthood,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
or wish for the pope named
Pacelli, Pope Pius, who

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
was the pope during World War
II, who watched the Jews go

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to the ovens of the Holocaust
and did nothing about it,

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
so that Pope Benedict can ask
that this Pope Pacelli become

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:90%
a Saint.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:90%
That's an angry church.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:84%
That's a church that says,
hey, it's OK for a pope

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to do nothing, and in fact
probably even assist Hitler,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
as the Jews believe, in
gassing millions of people.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And then 50 years after that,
it's OK for the current pope

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to say I think that guy
is actually a Saint.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Is that a Saint?

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that a church of love?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be kidding me.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Enough about that.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:90%
But Peter, it starts with Peter.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Because he was that angry guy.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Out of all of them,
he was the angry one.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Now I see you contending
against this woman

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
as if against an
adversary, says Levi.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you to reject her?

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Surely the Savior
knows her very well.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
That is why he loved
her more than us.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Then Levi says, we
should be ashamed

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and put on the perfect
person and go preach.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:90%
So we're perfect again.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
I said that today?

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:90%
10?

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:90%
12?

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Different contexts,
over and over again.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:84%
The way I interpret this
is Levi saying to Peter,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
shut up and put your
light body on, asshole.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Or just leave us alone.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Go be perfect, achieve your
light body, or shut up.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Just leave us alone.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, he didn't leave
us alone, unfortunately.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
He went and preach
something else, something

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:90%
that in my opinion is not true.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Mary we
have Jesus proclaiming

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that sin is not an
ethical problem,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:90%
it's a cosmological one.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Sin is how the Catholic
Church and other churches

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
have made billions upon
billions of dollars,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even fools
out of hundreds

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
upon hundreds of millions,
even billions, of believers.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Sin is not an ethical problem,
it's a cosmological one.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
In the Babylonian
conception of sin,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
sin was not the traditional
Christian concept of it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.084 align:middle line:90%
It came from Babylonia.

00:19:02.084 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And from Babylonians
it came from Egypt.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
To them, the temples were
not places of worship,

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:84%
they were places
you went to do work.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And the work that you
would do in these temples

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
was perfect yourself
into a light being.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
These temples were supervised
by other light beings,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:90%
say the Egyptians.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.662 align:middle line:84%
And what they wanted
were servants.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
These light beings
needed servants.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.107 align:middle line:84%
So they taught a class of
priests to serve the gods.

00:19:29.107 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And what they did, and what they
show in the temples of Egypt,

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
is they showed these
servants serving the gods.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're often
serving them food,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
they're serving them beer,
they're serving them wine.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But all of those are
symbols of energy.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Because what was understood
is that the gods were perfect,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:90%
the gods were pure.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they
wanted to be served,

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want to be
served by impure beings.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.175 align:middle line:84%
So they created this class of
pure beings, these priests.

00:19:58.175 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, Elijah, Enoch, Mary
Magdalene, John the Baptist

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
were all part of this
priesthood that were trained

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
to become perfect servants.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:84%
What that meant, of course,
is that the perfect beings

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
were teaching a class of humans
to become perfect themselves,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:90%
to become light beings.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
In the way the gods could tell
if you weren't doing the work,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
if you weren't
perfecting the craft,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
was your hair turned
gray, you aged.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:84%
That to the Egyptians
and the Babylonians

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:90%
was the definition of sin.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Sin meant not
becoming perfect, not

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
on the path to becoming perfect.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Today we have a completely
different conception

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.274 align:middle line:90%
on what sin is.

00:20:46.274 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Where did we go wrong?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Who took away from us?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Who pulled the rug out
from underneath us,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
the ideas that would tell us
that we can become perfect?

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And why aren't
churches workshops

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
where people do the
work, where they

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
learn the secrets
of alchemy, where

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
they learn to go from an
impure being to a pure being?

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Humanity's problem
is not a state of sin

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
so much as its arrogance
and ignorance of reality--

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that's where it starts--
the solution to which

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:84%
is the acquisition of
spiritual knowledge

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:90%
and the opening of the heart.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.276 align:middle line:90%
That's what the Gnostics taught.

00:21:21.276 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time-- I mean
we talked about Mary Magdalene

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
having her heart set on heaven
more than her brothers--

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and for a long time we thought
that the isolated stars

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and galaxies were
the whole story.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, she's got her
heart set on The Pleiades,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or on the center of
the galaxy, or maybe

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:90%
another galaxy altogether.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But now we realize that these
stars and these galaxies

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:84%
are embedded in a filamentary
structure of matter

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
both dark and invisible
that's called the cosmic web.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we know now,
what the ancients seem

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to have known--
at least according

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
to Gnostic tradition,
which originated in Egypt--

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the human soul comes
from this underlying original

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
kingdom, out of which
our reality emerges

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:90%
and is energized.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You come from thence,
Jesus tells his disciples,

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and you shall go
there once again.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other
dimensional realm

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:90%
that science is now discovering.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But it looks to us that this is
exactly what the Gnostics were

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
talking about in terms
of this other kingdom.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We call it dark matter
is one term for it.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's Philo of
Alexandria writing

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
at approximately the time
of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, this light
is the one star

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:84%
beyond all heavens,
the source of the stars

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that are visible to the
senses, Which, it would not

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.422 align:middle line:84%
be beside the mark to
call all brilliancy,

00:22:42.422 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and from which the sun, and
moon, and the rest of the stars

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
both errant and fixed draw
their light each according

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:90%
to its power.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a statement
to me that says

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that Philo knew
about dark matter,

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
knew that there was an
emergent reality out of which

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
our reality emerges, that
modern science has rediscovered

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and is learning more and
more about every day.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, I am the light
that is over all things.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I am all.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
From me all came forth, and
from me to all attained.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.402 align:middle line:84%
Lift the stone, split
the wood, there I am.

00:23:14.402 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And what that's
interpreted to mean

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is that in everyone
and everything

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is this energy from
this emergent realm

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:90%
that today we call dark matter.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And by learning to
connect with that,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
some profound things begin
to happen, one of which

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is happening at CERN in
Geneva-- which we'll talk about

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow-- where they are
researching dark matter,

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:84%
looking for something
called the god particle,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.107 align:middle line:84%
and proving the existence
of other dimensions,

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately
believing they're going

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to open
stargates and wormholes.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I was in Scotland
this summer and I

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:84%
went to a tiny
church, one of what

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
they call the
bloodline churches.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic tradition
Jesus and Mary Magdalene

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:84%
were married, they had children,
their offspring continued.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of these bloodline
churches is in Scotland.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And you see Jesus here as sort
of a magician, once again.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:84%
He seems to be reaching into
an other dimensional realm.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
His hand disappears
into another place.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's bringing
down, channeling

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.810 align:middle line:84%
some kind of energy, here
symbolized by the milk

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:90%
that he's pouring into a heart.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And now it's a flaming heart,
it's a spiritualized heart.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And the way I interpret
this is that what he's doing

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is attuning us to the
other dimensional realms

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that to ignite
the capabilities of the latent

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:90%
power within our heart.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
By awakening the
heart chakra, Jesus

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
put initiates in direct
contact with something

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:84%
called exousia--
exousia-- translated

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
as authority or power of
spiritual energy of that one

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
light that Philo talked
about that permeates

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and gives rise to all
physical manifestation.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It's an other dimensional
source of energy.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
The Bible talks about this,
that Jesus was performing

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:84%
an outlawed baptism in which he
was transmitting this authority

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
power or spiritual
energy called exousia.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It opened the heart,
it awakened the heart

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:90%
in an extraordinary way.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Gnostics
call it the light heart.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It's sun-like,
radiating luminous rays

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:90%
of love and wisdom.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And its awakening is
the very beginning

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.534 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic sovereignty.

00:25:26.534 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I took this photo in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It's St George and the dragon.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And you look at his heart.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this just
tremendous flaming

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:90%
heart or star-like heart.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
what this represents

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.086 align:middle line:84%
is it's symbolic
of that exousia,

00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
of that other dimensional energy
flowing through the heart.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
The apocryphal Gospel of
Peter uses the term exousia

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to signify the Christ
fire in the body of Jesus.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier
about this Christ fire

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and noted that it's
also called INRI.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
By fire, frequency,
or vibration humankind

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:90%
is made whole or holy.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:84%
It's by our connection
with this heart fire

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that we are able to
make this transformation

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:90%
into this heart-centered being.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.144 align:middle line:90%
