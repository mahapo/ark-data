00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.992 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So I want to
talk about the God

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Particle for a moment
in relationship

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to this cosmic sap and all
that we've been discussing.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Y'all have probably heard
that in Geneva, Switzerland,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070 align:middle line:84%
we have a little machine called
a particle accelerator there.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a 17-mile around ring, an
accelerator where scientists

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:84%
are hoping to start smashing
protons together and learn

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of the universe.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They also believe they'll be
able to create baby black holes

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and recreate the conditions
that existed just

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:90%
after the Big Bang.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about rings
of cosmic sovereignty,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that's where I think we're
building there in Geneva.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're a long way
from these guys here.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ours are
17 miles around.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
These guys had one that fit
in the palm of your hand.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a long way to
go towards miniaturizing

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:90%
these particle accelerators.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.571 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
what we're talking

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
about when we're talking about
the ring of cosmic sovereignty.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
earlier that Jesus

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.235 align:middle line:84%
had one of these rings
of cosmic sovereignty.

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:90%
He also had a magic wand.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
There are two types of
particle accelerators

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that we build today, the
linear accelerators like you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
have in Batavia,
Illinois at Fermilab,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I visited there
as well, and then

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
you have the ring-type
accelerator as you

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:90%
have at Geneva.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.445 align:middle line:84%
So we have the rod and
the ring in Jesus' hand,

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder if he's in fact
using some kind of a particle

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:90%
accelerator here.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.835 align:middle line:84%
This is the ring at
CERN, 17 miles around.

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:39.125 align:middle line:90%
It encompasses part of Geneva.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It goes on into France as well.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It's all underground.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.196 align:middle line:84%
I toured their last
summer, the summer of 2007.

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went there
because I wanted

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
to explore the signs and
symbols of the place.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Very interested in
this high energy

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:90%
physics work that they're doing.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.583 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to see, what kind
of artwork did they have there?

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
What kind of symbolism
did they choose here?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And what does that tell us
about what is going on there?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.584 align:middle line:84%
One of the key pieces
of religious art,

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the only piece
of religious art there,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:84%
is this beautiful statue of
Shiva stamping out ignorance.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Shiva, of course, is the
Lord of the Ring shown

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
within the ring of
cosmic sovereignty,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and it aligns it with
this idea that what

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
we're really trying to do at
CERN is to become ring lords.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
If we're successful in detecting
the God particle at CERN,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
it will enable us to graduate
from cosmic kindergarten, where

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
we're at right now
metaphorically speaking,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:90%
to first grade.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We will become full-blown
cosmic citizens.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is is you
go 300 feet underground.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:90%
You take the elevator down.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is the hallway leading
into what they called the ATLAS

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Detector, which is the
actual machine that's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
being used to detect what
they call the God Particle.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
The ATLAS Detector is
an enormous machine.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they call the
pit that this thing

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:90%
sits in a cathedral of science.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So they do use some interesting
religious terminology when

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:90%
describing the search here.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a man standing in
front of the ATLAS Detector.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
You can see that it's
just absolutely enormous,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
many stories high.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the most sophisticated
and expensive pieces

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
of machinery ever
built by humankind.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:84%
This is me standing
beside the ATLAS Detector.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.316 align:middle line:84%
You can't even get the whole
thing into a photograph

00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:90%
when you're standing there.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.267 align:middle line:84%
And it was a real privilege
be able to go in there.

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Look at the symbolism they
chose for the ATLAS Detector.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:84%
They went back to
the ancient world,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and they pulled Atlas out of
the hat-- Atlas, who lifted

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:90%
the world on his shoulders.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually not
the world that Atlas

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:90%
has on his shoulders.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look closely,
it's actually a zodiac.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.440 align:middle line:90%
A zodiac is a gate of stars.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So maybe what they're
trying to hint at here

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
is that Atlas is not only
going to be detecting the God

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Particle and help us to lift
our world, or the Word, the life

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
force energy, on our
shoulders, but maybe it

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of stargate
significance as well.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So I've been working
on this kind of angle

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:90%
on this for several years.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
share with you today

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
some interesting comments by
one of the scientists working

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
at CERN that supports
my contention here.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
The Large Hadron
Collider, as I said,

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:84%
is designed to create
baby black holes,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
creating a scenario
that's intended

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to replicate the
conditions present one

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
billionth of a second after
the so-called Big Bang

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that formed the universe.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this
in my presentation

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Revelation 2012, so I'll
just briefly explain

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
why I was so excited when
I came down that elevator,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
the doors open, and were
greeted by this sign.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
"Recreating the conditions
just after the Big Bang,"

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that is the purpose of the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It's to recreate
these conditions,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and therefore detect
the God Particle,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:84%
this elusive subatomic
particle that

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
will explain why
all matter has mass,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately complete our
physics kit-- taking us out

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
of, again, cosmic
kindergarten wondering what's

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
up into first grade,
cosmically speaking,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
where we have the ring of
cosmic sovereignty in our hand.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Why was that so important to me?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, for a long time,
I had been researching

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the messianic prophecies and
the Jewish legends of the herald

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:90%
or forerunner of the Messiah.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
This figure has a to-do list,
according to Jewish legend--

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:84%
get the Ark of the
Covenant, get the manna,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:90%
get the anointing oil.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
several of these things.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, recreate the
conditions-- well, excuse me.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Here's the exact quote.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:10%
"The Messiah will have
Elijah blow the trumpet,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:10%
and at the first
sound, the primal light

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.242 align:middle line:10%
which shown before the week
of creation will reappear.

00:05:48.242 --> 00:05:50.075 align:middle line:10%
And at the second sound,
the dead will rise,

00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:10%
and with this swiftness of wind,
assemble around the Messiah

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:10%
from all corners of the Earth.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the third
sound, the Shekhinah

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:90%
will become visible to all."

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
The primal light which
shown before the first week

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of creation, recreating
the conditions just

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:90%
after the Big Bang.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Sounds to me like
they're talking

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
about the exact
same moment in time.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:10%
This herald or
forerunner is charged

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:10%
with revealing the light which
shown before the first week

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:10%
of creation.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
At CERN, they're recreating
the conditions just

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
after the Big Bang, a
billionth of a second

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
after the Big Bang,
which to me sounds

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
like that's just before
the first week of creation.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking we've got
a perfect match here,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that what our collective
conscious is doing right now

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
is checking off another of the
items on the to-do list here.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
after that, this

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:90%
is when the dead will rise.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
We are the dead,
as I said earlier.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
If we're successful in
detecting the God Particle,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.544 align:middle line:84%
we will go from cosmic
kindergarten to first grade.

00:06:54.544 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But another way of
describing that is we

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:84%
will go from dead to
alive, cosmically speaking.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And everything else starts
to open up from there.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:10%
Remember Jesus said, I am the
light that is over all things.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:10%
I am from all.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:10%
From me, all came forth,
and to me, all attained.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:10%
Lift the stone.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:10%
Split the wood.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:10%
There I am.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what science
is doing at CERN.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
They're preparing
to split the wood

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
by slamming these
protons together

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
in hopes of
discovering or seeing

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.605 align:middle line:84%
this elusive subatomic particle
they call the God Particle.

00:07:28.605 --> 00:07:31.177 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.177 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Something that
intrigued me about this

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
is compare the symbolism of the
Large Hadron Collider, which

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is an eight-spoked wheel,
with the Maya symbol

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
of the galactic center, which
is also an eight-spoked wheel.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.939 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of fascinating--
a little bit of "as above,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:90%
so below" action going on there.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the way CERN portrays
the collision of these protons.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Looks like someone had
a bad hangover to me.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:10%
But the ideas is expressed, once
again, that what we're doing

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:10%
is colliding these particles,
and that ultimately,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:10%
what is going to
emerge out of this

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:10%
is a new science,
a new beginning,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.764 align:middle line:10%
a new dawn for humankind.

00:08:10.764 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
This God Particle,
as I mentioned,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be the key to
explaining why matter has mass.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And with it, we will become,
effectively, godlike beings.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Here's another simulation of
the detector at the Large Hadron

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Collider of these
protons colliding.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I found this other image here.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
It's the dove spitting the
symbol for the God Particle.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's really
interesting because CERN

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
was founded by European
high energy physics types.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
After World War II, they watched
as all the Nazi high energy

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
physics types went to
Russia or the United States.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The Europeans grew
concerned, because they

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
knew if the Nazi high energy
physics types were involved,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
weaponize whatever

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:90%
it is that they discover.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They all came over here,
went to work for NASA,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.764 align:middle line:90%
went to work in US labs.

00:08:56.764 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And for all we know, they may
have already discovered this

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and are, in fact, already
weaponizing this knowledge.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So the Europeans said, we want
to get together and create

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
a particle accelerator
that will be used only

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:90%
for peaceful purposes.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the symbol of the dove,
which is the symbol for peace.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But in Christianity, the dove is
the symbol for the Holy Spirit.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the symbol for Christ,
as a matter of fact.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have the
symbol of the Holy Spirit

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.029 align:middle line:84%
spitting the God
Particle, or dare

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
we just go ahead and
call it what it really

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:90%
is, the Christ Particle.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're really
talking about here.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So here's the stylized
logo of the God

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Particle, the collision
of the protons

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that will ultimately
reveal the God Particle.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
This is a particle physics news
and resources newsletter where

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%
they use this stylized logo.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:10%
And just food for thought
here, what I noticed

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.812 align:middle line:10%
is that in this 16th century
image of the Transfiguration

00:09:54.812 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:10%
from Crete, we see Jesus
in his light body form

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:10%
with the gateway behind them,
and he's got these three

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:10%
curious arrows pointing inward.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:10%
There's our three rays that
we talked about earlier once

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I decided to do is just
to take the God Particle logo,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
superimpose it on top of
the Transfigured Jesus,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.042 align:middle line:90%
and what do you know?

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just a perfect match.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.151 align:middle line:90%
That's just getting lucky.

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily mean
that that's exactly what they're

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.556 align:middle line:84%
But hey, there's
more to come here.

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:90%
We're just getting started.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of starting
to piece little pieces here

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
together of this
puzzle that science

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is presenting to us and the
symbolism that they chose.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:84%
In his book The God
Particle, Nobel laureate

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and Fermilab director
Leon Lederman

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:90%
writes, why the God Particle?

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And he says two reasons.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.431 align:middle line:84%
One, the publishers wouldn't
let us call it the Goddamn

00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Particle, though that might be
a more appropriate title, given

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
its villainous nature
and the expense

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:90%
it's causing, the frustration.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Lederman goes on to say that
there's a second reason why

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:90%
we call it the God Particle.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And it refers to a much
older book, he said,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
after which point
he connects the God

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Particle, the search
for the God Particle,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to the story of
the Tower of Babel.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And what Lederman
essentially says

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is that our search for this
and the discovery of the God

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Particle would make the
universe more simple,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
in essence undoing
the Tower of Babel.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, if scientists don't
want us to think like mystics

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and put a metaphysical
spin on their work,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
they just need to stop
doing stuff like this.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Because unless they want
us to think like this,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:90%
just stop this, OK?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Keep the two separate.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, Lederman says
that his publisher

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
put the title, The
God Particle, on it.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
They put sexy titles
on these books,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they
really don't mean it.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And here, he wrote
it himself, saying

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that we want to think in
terms of the Tower of Babel

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.906 align:middle line:84%
here when we're talking
about the God Particle.

00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just go with
him and say, all right.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's just ask the question.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Is the search for
the God Particle,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
is the particle accelerator
at CERN as well as

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
the one at Fermilab
a reenactment

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Babel incident when
humankind gathered together

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:84%
to build a ladder or gate
that reached into the heavens?

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're
really doing here?

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that's exactly
what we're doing here.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.731 align:middle line:10%
"Come, let us build ourselves
a city with a tower that

00:12:22.731 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:10%
reaches to the heavens
so that we may make

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:10%
a name for ourselves
and not be scattered

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.910 align:middle line:10%
over the face of the earth."

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what the book of Genesis
says about the Tower of Babel.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it also
said that if humankind

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
were successful in building
this God Particle detector--

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:90%
excuse me, the Tower of Babel.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess they're
interchangeable now,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Nothing they do will
be impossible to them.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say we're going
from cosmic kindergarten

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to first grade,
cosmically speaking.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're doing
is the impossible here,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
or what as here to before
been described as impossible.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
By the way, one of the real
world spin-offs of the God

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Particle is they've discovered
a technique whereby they can

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.284 align:middle line:90%
zap fat cells with vibration.

00:13:14.284 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And literally, they
believe that they're

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
create a technology,

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.974 align:middle line:84%
you'll just be able
to stand in a room,

00:13:18.974 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and your fat cells will just
simply be zapped away from you

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.742 align:middle line:90%
and fall off.

00:13:22.742 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a few years
away, but that's

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
one thing they say
for sure will drop out

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
of the research
they're doing at CERN.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Another is the Grid, which is
the new, souped up internet

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that is 10,000 times faster
than the current internet.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:84%
The internet was
invented by the Air Force

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
as a communication
system that would be put

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%
in place after a nuclear war.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The worldwide web
was invented at CERN

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
so that scientists
could share their data.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:84%
This Large Hadron
Collider at CERN

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
will spit out every
year the equivalent

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
of all of the data on Google.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Every year.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And so they needed a network
of computers, 100,000 computers

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to be specific, that
will be designed

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to help them unlock the
mysteries of the universe, one

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And scientists believe
that this Grid, which

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
is described as a
worldwide revolution,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
also has the capacity to
find a cure for cancer

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and save lives following
a natural disaster.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for us to imagine an
internet 10,000 times faster

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.816 align:middle line:84%
than what we've got presently
and the implications of that.

00:14:31.816 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:90%
But just try to think back.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
What was your life like in 1980
before there was the internet,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:90%
before you were online?

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.191 align:middle line:90%
It was very different.

00:14:40.191 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The Grid has already
been used, they

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
say, but is now more
powerful and has

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.125 align:middle line:84%
been declared ready to deal
with the deluge of data that

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:84%
will come from the
giant atom smasher

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.376 align:middle line:90%
when it fires up next spring.

00:14:50.376 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
kind of humorous

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that they've got on
this particular article

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
a photo of Steve Jobs down here
with his Apple behind them.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not
pinpointing Steve Jobs.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:84%
It's just the whole
computer industry is foaming

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:84%
at the mouth right now about
how they can make you an iBod

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and put you into that Grid.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
That Grid will be damn near
artificially intelligent,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.013 align:middle line:84%
and you won't be able
to tell the difference

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
between that Grid and God by
the time they're done with it.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
All our lives, everything
will be online and active.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:90%
You will be totally trackable.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:90%
You'll be chipped.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:90%
You'll be online.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll be able to enter your
consciousness at any time.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
They'll be able to
tune your emotions,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
good, bad, the ugly, at will,
whatever they want to do

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
real-world implications

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
of this, perhaps the
scariest part of this.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
At Yale, there was
an article yesterday

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I saw on dailygalaxy.com
where researchers at Yale

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
have discovered how they can
derive enough electricity

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to power these devices that
will be implanted in our skin

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
just by the electricity
coming off your cells.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So they finally figured
out, they believe,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
how they can use the
body as the charging

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.667 align:middle line:90%
system for these devices.

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:90%
That was one of the big hangups.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we can turn you into
an implant, a walking iBod,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.460 align:middle line:84%
but we need a power
source for it.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And they always
knew the body was

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.436 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous source of
energy, and now they've

00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:90%
finally cracked that code, too.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're good to go, just
about, and ready to launch.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
You're walking around
right now with a cellphone

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that you go like this with,
or you put in the Bluetooth

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.849 align:middle line:84%
in your ear, that's
going to start to recede.

00:16:26.849 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be putting
your Bluetooth in your tooth

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:90%
in a couple of years.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:90%
But that's intermediate.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Where they're aiming
for all of this

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is human skin as
the next platform

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:90%
for computer development.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
They want to literally put a new
skin on you that is then wired

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:90%
into this Grid, and off we go.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Having fun yet?

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Here's today's internet
in this graphic

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.342 align:middle line:84%
put out by the SyFy channel,
and here's the Grid.

00:16:56.342 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind of
humorous, because it

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.065 align:middle line:90%
looks like a wormhole to me.

00:17:00.065 --> 00:17:02.565 align:middle line:84%
It really illustrates the idea
that what we've got right now

00:17:02.565 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is just a tiny speck compared
to where all this is going.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.791 align:middle line:84%
CBS News, 60 Minutes went to
CERN just a couple of weeks

00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:90%
This is October 1, 2008.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
The Grid went online
October 3, 2008.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:90%
So all this is really fresh.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:84%
This just happened in
the past few weeks.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.683 align:middle line:84%
Steve Kroft went to the Large
Hadron Collider for 60 Minutes,

00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:84%
because they have
a problem there.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
They fired it up, then they
had to immediately shut down.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.447 align:middle line:90%
They had some kind of problem.

00:17:29.447 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It had to shut down till spring.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So Steve Kroft went
there to investigate.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:90%
He say, hey.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:90%
What's up?

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.997 align:middle line:90%
What's going on.

00:17:34.997 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:84%
He had a conversation
with a physicist

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.686 align:middle line:84%
named Bob Stanek, one of the
primary physicists at CERN.

00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
pertinent exchange

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
between Kroft and Stanek.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%
"Asked why scientists are
interested in recreating what

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
the universe was like a
nanosecond after the Big Bang,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Stanek tells Kroft,
'it's in humans' interest

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:90%
to know everything, right?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And why wouldn't you want
to know that?'" Steve Kroft

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
responds, saying "Well,
you'd want to know it.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, spending
$8 billion to find out,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:90%
it must be important."

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Stanek responds, "So, let
me ask you this question.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Because we've studied the
interactions of photons

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and electrons in
elementary particles,

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
we can understand how to take
the light that bounces off me

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and you into that camera,
and take that signal

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and put it into mom
and pop's living room.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine in 10 years, 20
years, will we be able to take,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of our
photons, me and you

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and put them into mom
and pop's living room?

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So you tell me,
is that worth it?"

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
That cracking sound was my
jaw hitting the floor, OK?

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Steve Kroft, too.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:90%
"Transport people?"

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Emphasis mine on the
incredulous response.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:90%
"You tell me.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Is that worth it?

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.865 align:middle line:90%
Is that worth $8 billion?"

00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:57.259 align:middle line:90%
Stanek responds.

00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Asked if he thinks
that could happen,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Stanek replies,
well I don't know,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
right now, I--
isn't it lunchtime?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I think I've said
too much already.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I better just buy
back everything

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I said because I don't
want to sound like I'm

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
some crackpot physicist telling
you that within 10 to 20 years,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
teleporting people.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, what it tells me
is that the ultimate objective

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:90%
at CERN is teleportation.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a stargate device.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what that is.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And discovering the
God Particle, that's

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
just one little
step along the way--

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
a minor inconvenience,
a solvable problem

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:84%
that will ultimately lead to
our ability to beam people up.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that slightly
change things in our world?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible, and
I was just blown away

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to have one of the physicists
at CERN say outright,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:90%
this is what we're doing.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
This is what it's
really all about.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, teleportation,
in my opinion,

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:90%
really isn't a new idea.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:90%
It's been around a long time.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a Cathar painting
by Hieronymus Bosch

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
from 1600 AD that
encapsulates the mystery

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
teachings of the Cathars,
a group of heretics,

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
as they're called, who
lived in southern France.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:84%
They claimed they possessed the
true original gospel of Jesus

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene,
and they received

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
that in a secret
symbol system that

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
was delivered to them by
Jesus or Mary Magdalene.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here is an
image of Saint Jerome praying

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
before a traditional
image of the crucifix.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:84%
We see the dead Jesus
strapped to the dead wood.

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars totally
dismissed this.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
They had no time whatsoever for
this kind of religious dogma

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and thinking.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
The Church, of
course, was heavily

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%
invested into this concept.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And when the Cathars
came along, the Church

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
found they had a little
problem with these guys.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
They had a civilization
in southern France

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.875 align:middle line:84%
who had the true gospel of
Jesus and Mary Madeline.

00:20:55.875 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they had
members of their culture

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%
that were perfecting themselves.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:90%
So what did the Church do?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they come down there and
say, hey, can you teach a thing

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.920 align:middle line:84%
or two about what
you've got going?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
The Church sent 30,000 storm
troopers into the Languedoc

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and exterminated, in the
first European genocide,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
as many as one million men,
women, and children Cathars.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They would pack 10,000
people into a room

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
about the size of the
lobby of this hotel

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and light the cathedral on
fire, burning them all to death

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:90%
in masse.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:90%
This is the first Holocaust.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.926 align:middle line:90%
The first Holocaust.

00:21:35.926 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
The Church has yet
to respond to that.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
They have yet to
apologize for that.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
They barely acknowledge that
they were responsible for that.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Tomorrow's the
anniversary of that.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.097 align:middle line:84%
>>Tomorrow, we're told, is
the anniversary of that,

00:21:49.097 --> 00:21:50.055 align:middle line:90%
which will be October--

00:21:50.055 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>It's called the
Crusade to Albigensian.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>It's called the
Albigensian Crusade.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
We could get out a
whole rant about this.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But what we want
to do is say, well,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
what was the Church
so afraid of?

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:84%
They're selling everybody
on this bullshit concept

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and exterminating people like
the Nazis exterminated the Jews

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
during World War II to withhold
a certain body of knowledge.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
What is that knowledge about?

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
What didn't they
want you to know?

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Hieronymus Bosch
bravely painted for you

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the Cathar conception
of the crucifixion

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.900 align:middle line:90%
and transfiguration.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.997 align:middle line:84%
This is a saved
Cathar soul ascending

00:22:30.997 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens through
what the Cathars referred

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to as the Christ Column,
the column of glory.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And so here we see the
soul going through,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
in its light body
form, up this cylinder

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:84%
filled with stars into
a higher heavenly realm.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the Cathar
version of the tale, which

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.455 align:middle line:84%
they said they learned directly
from Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:84%
600 years later or
so, Gene Roddenberry

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
cooks up the idea
of teleportation

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:90%
and introduces this idea.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Was he channeling
Hieronymus Bosch?

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I wonder.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
What we're told in
Star Trek history

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
is that Gene Roddenberry, when
he was producing the first Star

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Trek episodes, didn't
have very much money,

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and he needed some way for
his members of the Enterprise

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to get off the ship
down to the planet.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have money to build

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
models of little tiny
spaceships to send them down.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:30.299 align:middle line:84%
So they came up with the idea
of teleportation and beaming.

00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think this
idea has been around

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in human consciousness
for a long time.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars are certainly
saying that they

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
knew how to do this back
in the 13th century.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Church exterminated as
many as one million men, women,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and children to
withhold this knowledge

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because the Church has no
clue about what this is about.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
earlier, today we

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
have a Pope, Benedict, who
looked at the Nazi Pope,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Pacelli, Pope Pius, who
stood by and watched

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
as the Nazis marched the Jews
into the ovens of Auschwitz

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere and
did nothing about it.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a rabbi named
Yonassan Gershom who

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called
Beyond the Ashes

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that's very important
to acknowledge here.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
He was doing past
life regression

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.580 align:middle line:90%
work on Holocaust survivors.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And what he learned
from his regression

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
work is that over
and over again,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
these Holocaust survivors had
past life recall as Cathars

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:90%
in southern France.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with this
concept of the tikkun olam,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
a mass of souls who
incarnate together.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And when evil emerges
on the planet,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
this soul group
throws themselves

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
at that evil in order for
the rest of the culture

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:84%
or civilization to
get its act together

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:90%
in order to combat that evil.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that the
Cathars of southern France,

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
who were exterminated
by the Pope,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
by the Catholic Church during
the first European genocide,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:84%
were the same soul group that
reincarnated in Nazi Germany,

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and with the
collusion of the Pope,

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:84%
were marched to the gas
chambers of Germany and Austria.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And they did so, he
says, so that they

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
could alert the rest
of the civilization

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and get everybody
awakened to the presence

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.595 align:middle line:90%
of this evil on our planet.

00:25:23.595 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an Interesting concept.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Here's Hieronymus
Bosch's painting also

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:90%
from 1600 of the ascension.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And what he shows for
us here is a Cathar

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:84%
soul, a perfected soul, rising
into the heavenly realms.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul ascends
upward, and as it

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
goes higher and
higher, it ultimately

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:90%
is in its light body form.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And it enters these
concentric rings

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.311 align:middle line:84%
and enters into
this realm of light.

00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:52.811 align:middle line:90%
