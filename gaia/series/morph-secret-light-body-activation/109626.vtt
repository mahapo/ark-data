00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Rainbow body is what Paul is
talking about in 1 Corinthians

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.530 align:middle line:84%
15, when he proclaims
that we shall all

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
be changed in the twinkling
of an eye at the last trump.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of talk right now
that we're in the end times,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:84%
with the 2012 business
going on and world

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:90%
events, political events.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.811 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the
time, you hear people

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
saying they're seeing
signs and they're

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:84%
seeing evidence that we are,
in fact, in these end times.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.854 align:middle line:84%
And if Apostle Paul is
right, and he's not babbling,

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to
happen in a twinkling

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:90%
of an eye at the last trump.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look up the word
trump in the original Greek,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
it means a vibration, a tone,
a wave, or a reverberation.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:10%
So what Paul is saying is
that at the last tone, wave,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.945 align:middle line:10%
or vibration, we're all
going to be transfigured.

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
That mystic rapture
is going to happen.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
We know our bodies are
actually standing waves.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is a
tone or vibration

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that's headed our way, that's
going to just suddenly shift us

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:90%
all into this higher reality.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:90%
That would be really nice.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
In angelic symbolism, the
trump represents the instrument

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that joins Heaven and Earth.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:10%
So for example,
here, you see Jacob

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:10%
asleep on the stone with
his ladder, or stairway,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:10%
to heaven-- his Babel,
in other words--

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:10%
reaching into the heavens.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Jacob dreams that he
scales that ladder.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:90%
And note the musical term.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.116 align:middle line:84%
Jacob scaled the
ladder to Heaven.

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
He adjusted his frequency to
a higher dimensional realm

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and brought that
back into this realm.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And you notice the angels.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
They have trumpets
in their hands.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is the method
of attunement here.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the method
that the angels

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
are using to lift
Jacob's frequency,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
so that he can then
go through that gate.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, when we talk
about an instrument that

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
joins Heaven and Earth, we're
talking about wormholes.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
Notice the shape of
the way modern science

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
portrays the mouth
of a wormhole.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a trumpet.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence?

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.225 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I think what's
happening is that today,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:90%
we're going up a spiral here.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
We're recognizing that the way
we join ourselves to-- the way

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
we join Heaven and Earth
is through a stargate

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:90%
or a wormhole.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And in order to enter and
travel those wormholes,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
we are going to have to
adjust our frequency.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to become perfect.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:84%
As many of us know, we've
got an impending alignment

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
with the center of our
galaxy, December 2012, which

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans said
would be a moment

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.669 align:middle line:90%
of enormous transformation.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.502 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's
fascinating to bear in mind

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that Isaiah 30:26 refers to
an exotic light, seven times

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
brighter than the
light of the sun, that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.439 align:middle line:84%
will illuminate the world
when the Christos returns.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I talked with Art Bell
about this one time.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.224 align:middle line:84%
And he said, gol', that
doesn't sound real good.

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
the light of the sun

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
increasing by 7 times the
light of the moon, that's

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.721 align:middle line:84%
going to be-- everybody's
going to get fried from that.

00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:13.604 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they?

00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And my response
was, well, I think

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
it could be that we increase
our knowledge, our wisdom

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:90%
about what the sun is.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And we increase our wisdom
about the moon, as well.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Isaiah
30:25 tells us

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
when this illumination
will occur.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It says it will happen
when the towers fall.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, many towers have
fallen in our world,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
in recent times, that had a
dramatic volte-face effect

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:90%
on our world.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why people
get excited and think,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
wow, the 2012 is really the run
up to the Christian end times,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:90%
So start paying attention.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
My take is that the Christos
is not an individual.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.609 align:middle line:90%
Christos means the anointed one.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people seem to think
Jesus Christ is a person's

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:90%
name.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.095 align:middle line:90%
It's a title.

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like Mr. President.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like Mary Magdalene.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
That's probably not
her name either.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm an
equal opportunity--

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I like to insult
everybody, men and women.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene-- I mean, that
title means beloved tower.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%
That's a description.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene,
Jesus Christ-- that's

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
like Mr. President
and the First Lady.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.851 align:middle line:84%
Those are not
people's actual names.

00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:26.475 align:middle line:90%
They're titles.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
They refer to an
office that they held

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and a function that
they performed,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
bringing this anointing.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
To the Gnostics, Christos refers
to the true light or vibration,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
which, coming into the
world, enlightens every man.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what the return
of the Christ is.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not Barack Obama.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Jeez.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:90%
They called it INRI.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:10%
In fact, when Pontius Pilot
nails this inscription

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:10%
on-- above the cross, the Bible
says that what he meant to do

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:10%
was mock Jesus.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:84%
That's supposed
to stand for Jesus

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:90%
of Nazareth, King of the Jews.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Problem is Bible scholars
can't locate Nazareth.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
There was no place called
Nazareth at the time

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that Jos-- or that
Jesus was alive.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like his Uncle,
Joseph of Arimathea.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no place name
called Arimathea.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Either.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
These are titles that
these people possessed.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
The Nazarene.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And Pilot's supposed to have
done this to mock Jesus.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
What an idiot.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
How could this guy dare call
himself the King of the Jews?

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.296 align:middle line:84%
He had to know that we were just
going to hang his butt up there

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and crucify him.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's stating his crime.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But in esoteric tradition,
in the Gnostic tradition,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
INRI means something else.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
To the Gnostics,
it means by fire,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
frequency, vibration,
humankind is renewed whole.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
"Igne natura renovatur integra"
is the actual Latin term.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And it means by fire, frequency,
or vibration, humankind

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
is renewed or made
whole, 360, or holy.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Through this teaching, you
get the ring of the gods.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:90%
The ring of the gods.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a totally
different story here.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
utilizing this cross,

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.302 align:middle line:90%
the Latin term was Scala Day.

00:06:19.302 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the name of my
publishing company.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.242 align:middle line:90%
It means ladder to Heaven.

00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
That was the term that they
originally used for this.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the pillar,
or ladder, to Heaven

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that had, ultimately, at the
top, a signification that's

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
saying that this ladder was
actually a ring or a vibration.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Think of Jacob's Ladder, where
he scaled up his vibration

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and opened that gate
into the heavenly realms.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same story.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I was in California,
back, early this year.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a 2012
event with some--

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.724 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a panel
with other researchers.

00:06:55.724 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland
was on the panel.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
George Noory of "Coast to
Coast AM" was the moderator.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Dannion Brinkley
was on the panel.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.369 align:middle line:84%
David Wilcock was
on that panel, too.

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:90%
There were several of us.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And the topic was, what's
coming up for 2012?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.172 align:middle line:84%
And I talked a little
bit, in brief terms,

00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
about what we've be
talking about this morning,

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.755 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, this is
a real special time.

00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans are saying
that a gateway's

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.223 align:middle line:84%
going to open from the
center of the galaxy,

00:07:21.223 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and out of that gateway's
going to come an enlightened

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
being or a group of
enlightened beings.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland was more
comfortable with the idea

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that this time period we're
in is actually a window,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a
NASA launch window,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
space of time here,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
where-- that maybe
growing short--

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that we can gather as much of
this knowledge as possible.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning, I had
to do another 2012 panel.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And this one was
more about, what's

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:90%
going to happen after 2012?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And I told the
story that I was--

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
when I did that panel, that I
was sitting in my hotel room,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.811 align:middle line:84%
that next morning, just kind
of reflecting all of this,

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and saying, well, the Mayans
are talking about a gate,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Hoagland's saying
it's a window or a--

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying it's
a door or a gate.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.379 align:middle line:84%
Is there really
that much difference

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:84%
between a door and
a gate and a window?

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:90%
And who cares?

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And I look over.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And I see, on the door of
my hotel room, a cross.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.512 align:middle line:90%
And I get up.

00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And I walk over there,
thinking, wait a minute,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.875 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans described
2012 as a cosmic cross,

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:84%
as an alignment of
stars and planets.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what the cosmic
cross refers to.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
there's this cross

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:90%
on the window-- on the door.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up being a plan
for the hotel I was staying in,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.003 align:middle line:90%
the LAX Hilton.

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
well, yeah, duh.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
There's always a simple
explanation for everything,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
if you bother to look for it.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And what it was-- it was
the emergency exit plan

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.424 align:middle line:90%
for the hotel.

00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.692 align:middle line:84%
And it said, in
case of fire, this

00:08:51.692 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is how you want to
get out of here.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Look out this
peephole right here,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
make sure everything's
safe, then open the door,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.769 align:middle line:90%
and go to safety.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, wow, that's
a-- isn't that a great metaphor

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:90%
for our times?

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.769 align:middle line:90%
They're talking about 2012.

00:09:02.769 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And Christians are
talking about the return

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
of Christos, this fire,
frequency, or vibration coming

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:90%
onto our planet.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
What if it gets to be too
much and you can't handle it?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
What's your emergency
exit plan right now?

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you have one?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
The police state comes in,
starts to knock everybody down.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
What's your emergency
exit strategy?

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Kool-Aid.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Kool-Aid.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, this says, don't take
the elevator, take the stairs.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
take the stairs up.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.217 align:middle line:84%
Get up there, to the roof,
where we can see higher.

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at this further.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Dannion--
oh, Sean David Morton

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
was on that panel, too,
and he's just like, man,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:90%
what are you smoking?

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
information from doors?

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, dude,
this is a metaphor.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Think.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens here
is we've got too many of us,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
not in front of
this door-- they're

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.617 align:middle line:84%
standing in front of that
door, the mirrored door

00:09:57.617 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:90%
to the closet.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking,
wow, aren't I beautiful?

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.635 align:middle line:90%
I've got it made.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:90%
I've got money in the bank.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:90%
My house is paid for.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.532 align:middle line:90%
I'm happening.

00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Aren't I?

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But dude, slide over
here just a little bit.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
You want to get out of this
door of illusion right here.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
That could be taken away
from you in a heartbeat, just

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not real.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It's helpful in
this material world,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:90%
but let's get away from that.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
We've got to recognize that
what we really need to do

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is open this door that leads
into this higher consciousness.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
do that all at once.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying get a plan together.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Get a plan together.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Put as much time
in your eternity

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
as you're putting into your
401-- I mean your 201k now.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And everything's going
to be much better.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the emphasis
is all wrong here.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
You're in the mirror world.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:90%
You're in the illusionary world.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Money doesn't even exist.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept we're
all buying into here.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to buy into
another concept.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.716 align:middle line:84%
We need to put our
heads together,

00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
come up with an emergency exit
plan for this cosmic cross

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that's being erected
in our world right now

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility that
this frequency or vibration's

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:90%
coming into our world.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
what we need to do

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
is get our hands on
this door handle,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to be prepared to
open that door.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
talking about here,

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
today, is getting
ourselves prepared,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
getting out of that mirror
world, that bullshit world,

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
into this world,
and truly becoming

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:90%
all that we can be as beings.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:10%
And I think I got
through to Sean

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:10%
because later, I noticed that he
was doing an event in Toronto,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:10%
where he was talking about the
great prophecy conversions.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.588 align:middle line:10%
Learn about the potential
and peril ahead as we

00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:10%
move through the stargate
of the Age of Wonders.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.675 align:middle line:10%
It's like, right on, man
because here he is attacking me

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:10%
in the panel, but I
think he thought about it

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:10%
and said, wait a minute, this
is really what's real here.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else is real.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else is real.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Transfiguration.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where we have got to
begin putting our time, energy,

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:90%
and emotion.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's all about.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
So where we go to learn this?

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
How do we make that happen?

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we continue to study
images of transfiguration.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my favorites.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It's from a Coptic
or Egyptian Christian

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:90%
church in Aswan, Egypt.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is
the traditional image

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.346 align:middle line:90%
of the transfiguration.

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's slightly
different here.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:84%
We've got Jesus in
this cosmic egg here.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
He's got his bright
white clothing on.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.725 align:middle line:84%
He's got the Pharaoh's headdress
right up here, above him.

00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Got Moses and Elijah
on either side

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
because they mysteriously
appeared beside him,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.185 align:middle line:84%
as if they came from some
other dimension or something.

00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice
is that you've

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
got the cosmic egg with
these three rays extending

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:90%
from the cosmic egg.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Very important symbolism.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is because that
symbol is exactly the symbol

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians
used for the aakhut.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.315 align:middle line:90%
The aakhut.

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Look up the word aakhut in
the Egyptian hieroglyphic

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
dictionary.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And it means beings of
light-- wise, instructed folk.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Aakhut was also a name
for the Great Pyramid,

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:90%
which meant place of glory.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.217 align:middle line:84%
And God, I wish I could talk
like some of these Baptist

00:13:15.217 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Christian ministers.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Place of glory.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:90%
"Glo-ray."

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>"Glo-ray."

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>"Glo-ray."

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Glow raise.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was supposed to
be doing is glow and raise.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what the wise,
instructed folk, who built

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid, could do.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians are very clear
about who built the pyramids

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.929 align:middle line:90%
It's a resurrection machine.

00:13:37.929 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
That's becoming common
parlance among colleagues,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.780 align:middle line:84%
like Graham Hancock,
Robert Bauval.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They're very comfortable in
talking with you, in terms

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid as
a resurrection machine,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
built by the Aakhut, beings of
light-- wise, instructed folk.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why Jesus
is portrayed in that image

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is because in Egypt, they know
that he's one of these beings.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
First time I went to
Egypt, these Egyptians

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
would come up to me
and go, Christianity's

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian religion.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:90%
You all are Muslims.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.136 align:middle line:84%
Christianity's the
Egyptian religion.

00:14:10.136 --> 00:14:10.694 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:14:10.694 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
About the fifth
time I heard this,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:90%
I finally got what they meant.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Christianity's the
Egyptian religion.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:90%
But the name's changed.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just an updated version
of the original Egyptian

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
revelation brought by these
wise folk, beings of light.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:35.319 align:middle line:84%
It also means the light god,
the great light, the sun.

00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
In Budge's "Hieroglyphic
Dictionary,"

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
the following additional
definitions of aakhut

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.760 align:middle line:84%
are provided-- to be bright,
to be excellent, or to be wise

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:90%
or instructed.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:84%
What do we want to
be instructed in?

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:90%
How to perfect ourselves.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
How to become perfect,
so that then we

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
can go through these stargates.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
As Graham Hancock and
Robert Bauval also

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
explained, in "The
Message of the Sphinx,"

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the hieroglyphs
of aakhut can also

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
mean transfigured
beings, shining ones,

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:90%
or shining beings.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
This is who these people were
that built the pyramid, that

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
established that civilization
and left this teaching for us,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:90%
saying, you can do this too.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to send out,
over the intervening eons,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
various teachers
who will continually

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%
update this message for you.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And the last time that
this was really updated

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:90%
was about 2,000 years ago.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time for us
to update it once again,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
based upon our contemporary
understanding of what

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
this means.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, one
of my favorite temples

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:90%
is the Temple of Dendera.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the temple of love and
joy, attributed to the god--

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
or dedicated to the
goddess, Hathor,

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:90%
the goddess of love and joy.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The word Dendera
means house of bread.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:90%
House of bread.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wait, there's a
New Testament word

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.715 align:middle line:90%
that also means house of bread.

00:16:02.715 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's right.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Bethlehem means house of bread.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
One problem is, again, biblical
scholars can't find Bethlehem,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.169 align:middle line:84%
at the time that
Jesus was supposed

00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
to have been kicking--
come kicking and screaming

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:90%
into this world, in a manger.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:84%
This temple of
Dendera was brand new

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Jesus
and Mary Magdalene.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Brand spanking new.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
You mean, like, as if
it were built for them?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And it means house of bread,
exactly like Bethlehem?

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
You get into this
Temple of Dendera,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and you look up at the ceiling.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
You see this
magnificent imagery that

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
rivals the Sistine
Chapel, which, you see,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
are the gods, the shining
ones, the transfigured ones,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the aakhu, sailing aboard
their ships of eternity,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:90%
into the stars.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They call these ships
the Ark of the Millions

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of Years, the Bark
of the Sun, the Bark

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Millions of Years.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And over and again, you
see these god beings

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:90%
on these ships.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, I was the first
to notice that when

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
you look at Osiris, here,
as a transfigured being,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:84%
as a light being, in the stars--
actually, in the constellation

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Orion-- that the way
the ancient Egyptians

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
portrayed that shift
of eternity precisely

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
matches the way modern
science portrays a wormhole.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.391 align:middle line:84%
Now, Egyptologists
love to laugh at me

00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
when I start talking
about this because there's

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
no way these light beings, who
are vastly advanced from us,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:84%
had any consciousness remotely
similar to what we, today,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
think of as stargate or
wormhole consciousness.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I just offer them a
Krispy Kreme doughnut

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, have a nice day
because the archaeologists

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and Egyptologists I do
respect, that I think

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
do have a clear understanding,
say there's no question,

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, that
those shapes match.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.176 align:middle line:84%
Now, what it means,
we can't say for sure.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm
suggesting to you is

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
that these light beings
traveled the stars

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:90%
in stargates and wormholes.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:84%
They knew what we are just
now learning and rediscovering

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:90%
in their temples.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And the transfiguration
of these beings-- in fact,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
of our body into light--
is a preparatory experience

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
towards traveling the stars
through these stargates

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:90%
or wormholes.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I was recently in the University
of Pennsylvania Museum.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I see this
magnificent column.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And it goes up.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And it goes up.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's got its lotus
opening at the top.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, when
I zoom in on it, whoa,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going into that thing!

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Holy smokes!

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:90%
That was a weird experience.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It was actually Ptah,
the ancient Egyptian god

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
who is credited with
crafting the human body, who

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
also designed the
stargates of the gods.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that suggest a
linkage between our DNA

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and these stargates?

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.899 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what
I'm seeing here.

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we have this attunement
here, the god is being

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
attuned-- or the Pharaoh is
being attuned to the winged sun

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
disc, a dual headed serpent
ship that symbolizes the sun.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting because
the ancient Egyptians

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
believed that the sun,
that star in our sky,

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:90%
was actually a tunnel.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
They thought of it as a
star tunnel, a sun tunnel,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:90%
or a stargate.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.665 align:middle line:84%
And that is one
of the criticisms

00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
that Egyptologists
love means that this

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Bark of the Millions of
Years-- that's the sun boat.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, your right.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
comfortable with that,

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
so long as you recognize that
the sun boat looks-- resembles

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
a wormhole.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have the god going
through this gate of stars

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that I prefer to
call a stargate.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient
Egyptians viewed our sun

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
as a sun tunnel or stargate.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
The way to get to Heaven
was through the sun.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the way and
the truth in the light.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:10%
This is Ra aboard
his ship of eternity.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:10%
And the caption reads, I, even
I, know the ways to the doors

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:10%
to the field of the blessed, the
dimension of the blessed, which

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:10%
they believed was this
dimension that's one

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:10%
dimension over from our own.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's clearly on
his wormhole craft,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
sailing into that gate of stars.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the way NASA
shows this craft, today.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about building
these penis shaped craft that

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
can go into this circular
or vagina shaped stargate,

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
or wormhole, and make
the cosmic connection.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Shiva lingam.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Shiva lingam.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.725 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the reason
why this looks

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
like a sperm going
into an egg is

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
the ultimate creation science,

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
the original sacred science.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And it makes perfect sense
that when our big brains say

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
they're going to build
a wormhole craft,

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:84%
a stargate craft, it
should look like a penis,

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
or it should look like
a sperm because that's

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
what the sacred science says
is the principle at work

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
here, the unity
of man and woman,

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
male and female,
which we're going

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:90%
to talk about more tomorrow.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And again, the match is made.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the original
sacred science of the gods

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:90%
is stargate science.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:90%
It's stargate Christianity.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It's wormhole science.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is all about.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And the sun, once again,
is the door, or the gate,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that leads to the heavenly
realms, which is what

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:90%
that glyph means, right there.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the way, the
truth, and the light.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:10%
The way to get to Heaven
is through the sun.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.464 align:middle line:10%
Do you have a
relationship with the sun?

00:21:27.464 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
People ask that around here.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a
relationship with the sun?

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:90%
I love the sun.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I love to get out in the sun.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I love to look through
the sun to Heaven

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
because that's how you get
to Heaven is through the sun.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the door, the
gate that we travel through.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras was one of the
greatest teachers of all time.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.694 align:middle line:90%
He had a stepbrother.

00:21:47.694 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
His father was out on a
business trip one day.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And he sees this little
kid that is a light being.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And this light being says
he came from the sun.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are other illuminated
beings that live in the sun.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And this son, this child,
which they named him Astarios,

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
or Star Being,
taught Pythagoras.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's example
after example of beings

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
that come from the sun or
have the sun consciousness,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:90%
the stargate consciousness.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Osiris is one.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
You see him here as the Green
Man, the Regenerated Man.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, being
green meant a hell of a lot

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:90%
more than recycling.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
green civilization,

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
as ancient Egypt was, it was
all about transfiguration

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:90%
and regeneration.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And these principles
enable the civilization

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to last for thousands of
years-- not hundreds, like ours.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of years.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at Osiris here,
and we see the sun, right

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:90%
there, on his crown chakra.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And what that indicates
is he is-- he's

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:10%
got that solar consciousness.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the children of
the sun, or sons of the sun,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:84%
as they're called, and
recognizes that the sun is

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:90%
the way to Heaven.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The way to get to the
Father is through the sun.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
Christianity then came

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:90%
along and put Jesus in the sun.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And they started spelling it
S-O-N instead of S-U-N. Changed

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:90%
things a little.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But we still have that stargate,
right up there in our sky.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And the way to get to
the heavenly realms

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:90%
is through that star.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.769 align:middle line:84%
And our star is
connected to other stars.

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
message of stargates

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:84%
is that this whole
universe is interconnected.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can travel from
star to star to star,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:90%
for eternity, as a light being.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Anybody interested in that?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:84%
If not, there's a Krispy
Kreme doughnut store just

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.222 align:middle line:90%
up the street.

00:23:39.222 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten introduced this
incredible mystic religion,

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
the religion of the Aten,
the disc-- the sun disc.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's portrayed
here as a Sphinx,

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:90%
basking in the rays of the Aten.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It happens that at the
end of each of these rays,

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.860 align:middle line:84%
there are ankhs,
or keys of life.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer to call
the Aten the Atone.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Because what he's doing
is he's becoming at one

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:84%
with the universe through
the atone, or tones,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:90%
coming from the sun disc.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
He's made himself one with
the sun and, as a consequence,

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:84%
has become an ascended
being because we

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
see that he and his
wife, Nefertiti,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.415 align:middle line:84%
are wearing seamless garments
that are transparent.

00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
What that symbolized to
the ancient Egyptians

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
was their light
body, that they are

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
receiving the energy of the
sun and becoming light beings.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
They are Christ,
Magdalene prototypes.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Essenes--
Jesus, Mary Magdalene,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and the others that were part
of that esoteric research group

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
drew heavy influence from
Akhenaten and Nefertiti.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten, of course, was
virtually run out of Egypt

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%
by the military.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:90%
He introduces this.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
Haight-Ashbury or something.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
He introduces this Renaissance,
or enlightenment period,

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:90%
The military can't handle it.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So they come in,
run him out of town,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and shut down this
religious revolution

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
that's based on
enabling anybody to bask

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90%
in the energies of the sun.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Before, everybody
was worshipping

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
the bureaucracy of
ancient Egyptian gods,

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:90%
over 300 of them.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Akhenaten comes in.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
He tears the roofs off all
of the temples and just says,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
get everybody out
there in the sun.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.324 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the way, the
truth, and the light.

00:25:28.324 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And the way to Heaven
is through the sun

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and becoming one with the sun.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the
great illuminator.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Powerful, powerful teaching.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, history refers
to him as the Heretic King.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
History just can't handle
an enlightened civilization.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So they disparage people like
Akhenaten, call him crazy.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.664 align:middle line:84%
I ran into a friend
the other day.

00:25:53.664 --> 00:25:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, I haven't
seen you in awhile,

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:90%
let's go get a cup of coffee.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, I've got to go
over to the Obama office,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.225 align:middle line:84%
here in Nashville,
and make some calls.

00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
mean Barackhenaten?

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.204 align:middle line:90%
He said, what did you say?

00:26:06.204 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, Barack Obama looks
just like Akhenaten to me,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.644 align:middle line:84%
and I think he's on the
same kind of destiny path.

00:26:12.644 --> 00:26:13.143 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:13.143 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
He's wanting to bring about
this so-called awakening

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.945 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:26:15.945 --> 00:26:17.356 align:middle line:90%
And up with education.

00:26:17.356 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:90%
And down with the military.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.604 align:middle line:90%
Well, he might get elected.

00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But if he starts tearing the
roofs off of the temples,

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
they're going to do to him
what they did to Akhenaten.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:90%
He's following that same path.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I put this up on
my website just for kicks.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm not voting for
Akhin-- Barack.

00:26:31.645 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I'd vote for Barackhenaten.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.335 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
voting for Barack Obama.

00:26:35.335 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Not sure if I'm voting for
John McCain yet, either.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I haven't decided.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that, hey,
this could be the candidate

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:90%
with the light stuff, here.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:90%
I just thought it was fun.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm
watching the debate.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.181 align:middle line:90%
John McCain is making a point.

00:26:53.181 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about an
energy bill that was passed.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, he goes,
and that one, he voted for it.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:90%
That one?

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Did he just say, that one?

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:90%
The atone?

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:10%
Did he just psychically
pull this out of nowhere

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:10%
and somehow use this expression
about Barack Obama that

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:10%
perfectly coincides with
him embodying the Akhenaten

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.981 align:middle line:10%
archetype reaching up to the
Aten or the Atone-- the one?

00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't have that
in our civilization.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:90%
We can't have oneness.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.442 align:middle line:84%
Then CNN and Fox News-- I
mean Fixed News-- goes out

00:27:28.442 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
of business because then
they can't hate one another.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.159 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have the
left wing of the Illuminati

00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and the right wing
of the Illuminati.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
You can't ever
just have the one.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
It's always got to
be this division.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It's always got to
be us versus them.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.801 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:27:42.801 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's funny that
the Atone suddenly creeps

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.923 align:middle line:90%
into our crisis moment here.

00:27:49.923 --> 00:27:50.422 align:middle line:90%
