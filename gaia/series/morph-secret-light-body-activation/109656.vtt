00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.904 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:84%
In this section, I
wanted to talk about some

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
of the ideas that
are in our culture,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:84%
especially the
technology side, that

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:84%
have to do with this
transhumanization,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to see more
and more of this coming online

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:90%
here in the coming years.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Earlier we looked at this
symbol from Glastonbury Tor

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately
symbolizes the Holy Grail.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And I noted that it's
strikingly similar to the symbol

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that we use for quantum
entanglement today.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And we wonder, is this what
the grail is really all about,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.667 align:middle line:90%
it's about quantum entanglement?

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement says
it's possible to link together

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
two quantum particles, photons
of light or atoms for example,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
in a special way that
makes them effectively

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:90%
two parts of the same entity.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
You can separate them as far
as you like and a change in one

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
is instantly reflected
in the other.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing concept.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the first
practical applications

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
of quantum entanglement are
starting to come online.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
The first thing most
people think of,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.373 align:middle line:84%
including a report produced
by the Department of Defense

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
shortly after entanglement
was proved real,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is being able to use it to
communicate faster than light.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Then there are
quantum computers,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:84%
which are going to start
revolutionizing our world.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
These are conceptual
machines that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
can crack problems that would
take an ordinary computer

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
longer than a lifetime
of a universe to solve,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and they can store infinite
amounts of information.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:10%
Quantum computers,
especially the Japanese

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:10%
are on the forefront
of this, can manipulate

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:10%
subatomic particles to perform
lightning-fast calculations,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:10%
some closer to-- they
came closer to reality

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:10%
recently when a
Japanese demonstrated

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:10%
that it created a quantum
circuit that could control

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:10%
the building blocks of atoms.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk about
a godlike ability.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
literally being

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
able to control
atoms themselves,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
the matrix of the universe.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
In February, 2007, a company
called D-Wave Systems

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of Vancouver, British
Columbia launched

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.035 align:middle line:84%
the Orion-- an appropriately
named technology,

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:84%
because that's the name
of Osiris when he ascends,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Orion-- what they call the
world's first commercially

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:90%
viable quantum computer.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.477 align:middle line:84%
Here is a depiction of
one of their processors.

00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of intriguing-looking.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Looks sort of like a
cross maybe or something.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
look at another one

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
of their processors, you start
to get the idea of where we're

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:90%
really going with all this.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.789 align:middle line:84%
You see the vesica in the
center of that processor.

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests,
well, wait a minute,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, maybe these
quantum computers

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:84%
are what is ultimately going
to blast open these star gates,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.246 align:middle line:84%
and that what we're
on the verge of here

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is creating these
machines that can

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:90%
in fact help us to transfigure.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.914 align:middle line:84%
Is that how we're going
to do it in this age?

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the
ancients, they seem

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.585 align:middle line:84%
to have tapped into the
imagination and the power

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, are we
here telling us today

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have to
do it through technology?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Should we embrace
this technology?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Should we make it
part of ourselves?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Or is this literally a
set of training wheels

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.084 align:middle line:84%
that is going to ultimately
refer to our bodies?

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to come
back to our bodies?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:90%
That's my hope.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Another practical
application of entanglement

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.652 align:middle line:84%
is human teleportation,
like faxing yourself places.

00:03:31.652 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are scientists
around the world

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
that are actually working on
this technology right now.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's really remarkable
to think about this.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.549 align:middle line:84%
By interacting the particle with
one half of an entangled pair

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and then putting the
other half of the pair

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
through a special process,
a bit like a logic

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
gate in a computer,
it's possible to make

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
an identical particle
at a remote location.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
We can only do this because
the entanglement transfers

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the quantum information without
us ever knowing what it was.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
In the process, the original
particle loses its properties.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:90%
And teleportation isn't copying.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It effectively destroys
the individual.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So when CERN talking about
the possibility of teleporting

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
humans in 10 or 20 years,
what they don't tell you

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is that in order
to teleport you,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
they're going to destroy you and
then reassemble a copy of you

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.969 align:middle line:90%
at another location.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:29.885 align:middle line:90%
Comfortable with that?

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Jesus saw infants being suckled.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:10%
He said to his disciples,
these infants being suckled

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:10%
are like those who
enter the Kingdom.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:10%
They said to him, shall we then
as children enter the Kingdom?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.805 align:middle line:10%
Jesus said to them, when
you make the two one

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:10%
and when you make the
inside like the outside

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:10%
and the outside like the inside
and the above like the below,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and when you make the male and
the female one and the same

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:10%
so that the male not be
male nor female, female,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:10%
and when you fashion eyes
in the place of an eye

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:10%
and a hand in place of a hand
and a foot in place of a foot

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:10%
and a likeness in
place of a likeness,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:10%
then you will enter the Kingdom.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like he's talking
about entanglement to me.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like he's
talking about making

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
an image or a copy of
himself and faxing himself

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
into the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
What's God's fax
number, by the way?

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.771 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody remember?

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
That, by the way, is from the
Gospel of Thomas, Saying 22.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.307 align:middle line:84%
Seems to me a clear reference
to quantum entanglement.

00:05:38.307 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what Thomas went through.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he made
an image of himself

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and projected himself
into this realm

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.564 align:middle line:84%
and then projected himself
back into the heavenly realm.

00:05:49.564 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Death and rebirth
was at the heart

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Christian ministries,
especially that of the Essenes.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And by enacting the death
and rebirth in life,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
the soul would gain
familiarity with the workings

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:90%
of the dimension of the blessed.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The historian Josephus, who is
quite direct on this matter,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:84%
says, quote, "it is a
fixed belief of theirs"--

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes-- "that the body is
corruptible and its constituent

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
matter impermanent, but
that the soul is immortal

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and imperishable."

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.425 align:middle line:90%
The divine spark.

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
"Emanating from
the finest ether,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:84%
these souls became
entangled"-- emphasis mine--

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
"as it were in the
prison house of the body,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to which they were dragged down
by a sort of natural spell.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But when once they are released
from the bonds of the flesh,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
then, as though liberated
from a long servitude,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.056 align:middle line:84%
they rejoice and
our borne aloft."

00:06:41.056 --> 00:06:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Entanglement seems to be an
ancient concept as well, just

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
like teleportation.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.985 align:middle line:84%
They thought of it
differently, though.

00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:48.694 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement involves
two separate particles

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
behaving as if they are
essentially one and the same,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
even though they are
separated by a great distance.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.892 align:middle line:84%
Changes to one particle will
be mirrored in the other half.

00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we
started, we talked

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.805 align:middle line:84%
about that story of
Thomas and his divine self

00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that lived in that
divine realm and how

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
we was creating a mirror
image of himself here

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and was in constant contact
or could be in contact

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:90%
with his higher self.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Using this phenomena
of entanglement,

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
physicists have been able to
transport or in effect teleport

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the properties of one particle
to another, in the case

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
of atoms over a distance
of about half a meter

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and in the case of photons
over tens of kilometers.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're making rapid
advancements on this every day.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.743 align:middle line:84%
And it may come up
here soon that you're

00:07:37.743 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
seriously consider

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
if you want to start teleporting
yourself around by destroying

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
this and making a perfect
copy at another location.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see the
movie The Prestige?

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't seen The
Prestige with Hugh Jackson,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:90%
go watch that movie.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But please, watch it--
save yourself enough time

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.069 align:middle line:84%
so you can watch
it back to back,

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:00.485 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only way
you're really going to get it.

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
It talks exactly about
what we're describing here.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I've seriously
considered too the idea

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that we should be looking
for entangled communications

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:90%
from outside worlds.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe crop circles represent
those communications.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the Gospel of Thomas
is talking about a story

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:90%
about entanglement.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Surely that's what they're
considering here at CERN.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.108 align:middle line:84%
When they're talking
about teleportation,

00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
it's ultimately entanglement.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene I believe
knew these secrets.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
As we talked just
a moment ago, she

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
was given her cloak
of light, her cloak

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Illuminati,
who is portrayed here

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
on the cover of my book
by Dana Augustine wearing

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
her cloak with her
open gate behind her,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
that three-dimensional image
going into another location,

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:90%
the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Another word for transfiguration
that we use today

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:90%
is transhumanize.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
transhumanization movement

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:90%
that's afoot out there.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Dante is the one who coined this
remarkable word, transhumanize,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
in his epic poem
the "Divine Comedy."

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
To Dante, transhumanize is
an experience, not a word.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And today, there's a whole
marketing campaign out here

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that's directed at encouraging
you to transhumanize yourself.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not fully
human unless you've

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
got one of these
Bluetooth things

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.004 align:middle line:90%
sticking out of your ear.

00:09:21.004 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You're not fully human
unless you've got

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.366 align:middle line:90%
an iPod strapped to your body.

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
What's happening, as I
mentioned a couple of times,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a convergence
of technology that's occurring

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:90%
in our world right now.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Bits, atoms,
neurons, genes, bang,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
they are all coming together
into one technology.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Computer science,
nanotechnology, neuroscience,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and genetic technology
is all becoming

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:90%
one technology, one science.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
As I wrote in my book,
Oracle of the Illuminati,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
several years ago,
we're entering

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
into a world in which
mortality gives way

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to human-machine hybrids
they can live for hundreds,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:90%
if not thousands of years.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:90%
This is very attractive.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
This can be very tempting
to go down this road,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because if you can live
to say be 200 years old,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
you can read a lot of books
in a couple hundred years.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
You can visit a lot
of power places.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
You can absorb a lot of
this wisdom, or maybe not.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe by accepting
this interface,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
you forego the capability
of actually using

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
the body for the purpose
that it was originally

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:90%
meant to be used.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Are we envisioning
a world in which

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
a small class of
people in possession

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of this sort of technology
genetically engineers babies

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
to be a superhuman race, a world
in which these same people turn

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:90%
traditional humans into slaves?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The inevitable effect
of this convergence

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is the transformation
of Homo sapiens

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
into several different
types of transhuman life.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
These transhuman life forms
will possess complete control

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
of their immediate physical
universe and their own bodies,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as possess intellects
far superior to anything

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
our present state can imagine.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
We're the last human beings
ever to walk on this planet.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Children that are
being born now,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that they are
indoctrinated in this way

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and become hybrid children,
probably are no longer

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
going to be Homo sapien.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.746 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
something else, be hybrids.

00:11:25.746 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:84%
As Blake said, man
is all imagination.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
The eternal body of
man is the imagination.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:90%
That is God himself.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
We need to accept the
power of our imagination

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:90%
that we can do this.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:84%
As the Gnostics taught, we
can enter through the image.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:10%
We can connect mentally,
physically, spiritually,

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:10%
and emotionally with
images such as this

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:10%
and become these
ascended beings.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:90%
We're hardwired already.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:90%
It's inside of us.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
What we need is like
that caterpillar looking

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
at the butterfly,
we need a target.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
target right here.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics said the image
itself will show you the way.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
They knew the power
of these images.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And these were literally
like gospels to them.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
They make new
connections within us.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:90%
They open the pathways.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
We know from research
in psychoneuroimmunology

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that feelings of
helplessness weaken us.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:90%
It weakens our immune system.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But a sense of empowerment
strengthens it.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is focus
on not images of terror

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and torture as we see here.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So a local psychologist
named Dr. Mario Martinez,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.455 align:middle line:84%
he studied stigmatics
for the Vatican.

00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
He actually met a
woman in California

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:84%
who exhibited the stigmatic
marks after obsessively reading

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:90%
about the crucifixion.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
She reads about this
excessively obsessively,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
suddenly her body manifests
the stigmatic marks.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible power.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Can't we channel that in
the other direction too?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what Dr. Martinez's
theory of biocognition states,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that we all have a personal
bioinformational field, which

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:90%
is expandable.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
The horizons of this field
can be expanded either

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on fear
or focusing on love.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
If you expand by interacting
with the horizons of Christ

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
or Jesus as your
target, then you'll

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
identify either with his
suffering or his love.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And if it's with his suffering--
and this is very rare--

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
you could exemplify
the stigmatic marks.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, if you follow and
identify the path of love,

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
you could experience healing or
special abilities to do things.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.521 align:middle line:90%
You might even transfigure.

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You've got to become
obsessed with it.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the key, making
this the cultural norm,

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.962 align:middle line:84%
making this the
ultimate objective.

00:13:52.962 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
There are various
researchers, scientists

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:90%
that talk about morphic fields.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:10%
There is a morphic
field that exists,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:10%
a field within and around
a self-organizing system

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:10%
that organizes its
characteristic structure

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:10%
and pattern of activity.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a morphic field
of the transfiguration.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And according to the hypothesis
of formative causation,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:10%
morphic fields contain
an inherent memory

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:10%
transmitted by previous similar
systems by morphic resonance

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:10%
and tend to become
increasingly habitual.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we can tune
into the morphic field

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of the transfiguration and
put ourselves in resonance

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
with what is happening in
those transfiguration icons,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that's how we began
to embody this.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:10%
Morphic fields
include morphogenetic,

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:10%
behavior, social, cultural,
and mental fields.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is why we can include
the transfiguration in there,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:10%
because the greater the degree
of similarity, the greater

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:10%
the influence of
morphic resonance.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do is put
ourselves in resonance

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and attune ourselves mentally,
physically, spiritually,

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally with these
images and begin to then

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:90%
embody them.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Morphogenetic field
theory tells us

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that all manifest
forms are built

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:84%
upon unseen templates
of light and sound,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:90%
called morphogenetic fields.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Morphogenetic fields
of light and sound

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
composed a set of electrical
tonal standing wave patterns

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
called scalar waves.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's what our body is.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how images such as
the transfiguration and others

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that we looked at
point us to the way

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
in which this process happens
and literally how easy it is.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:10%
We're told that
our planetary field

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:10%
has a morphogenetic
field, a scalar

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:10%
grid that's divided
into sections

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:10%
called planetary shields.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So by visiting various power
centers, like Nashville, Giza,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Scotland, elsewhere
around the world,

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:84%
we're putting ourselves in
the places where these code

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:90%
seals can be opened within us.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important
part of this process.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It's important for us
to go to these places

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and be together in these
places and receive the energy.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Morphic resonance is another
term that follows in here.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And morphic resonance is
defined as the influence

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of previous structures on
subsequent similar structures

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of activity organized
by morphic fields.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
According to the hypothesis
of formative causation,

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
morphic resonance
involves the transmission

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
of formative influences
across space and time

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
without a decrease due
to a lapse of time.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.979 align:middle line:84%
This takes us back to
entanglement again, that there

00:16:28.979 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:90%
are beings that have done this.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
We are quantumly
entangled with them.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And through the
morphic field created

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
by all their past efforts,
we can tune into that

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and effect that transfiguration
within our own body.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Morphogenesis says our
choices and decisions

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and the behavior
that follows directly

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
shapes the structure of
your DNA and the memories

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:84%
that are encoded there
for future reference.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The work that you're
doing is literally

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:90%
changing your family tree.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
By coming to this
experience this weekend

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and being together, you've
changed my family tree

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and you have changed
my family tree.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:90%
Did I say that right?

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I've changed your family tree
and you have changed mine,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
because our DNA is affected
through this process

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:90%
of morphogenesis.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The change that I'm
doing in my life today

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
affects my sisters,
my mother, my nieces,

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
my father who passed
away seven years ago,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather, my
great-grandfather,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
my whole family line they
say maybe going back as

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
far as seven
generations, because we

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
are morphogenetically
attuned to one another.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
That's not putting
any pressure on you.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:84%
That's talking about the
promise of what you're doing.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>It's liberating.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>It's liberating,
absolutely liberating.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
When we make right
choices, our DNA

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is affected and so is the DNA
of everyone in our family tree.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we tune
into these images,

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
now knowing that if we
start obsessively imagining

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
this gate within
us, in our body,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
as having these
capabilities, then

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into this
bioinformational field,

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
the morphic field of
the transfiguration

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
and begin this process.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
choice that we have.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:10%
Are we imagining a world in
which human beings routinely

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:10%
achieve their light
body or are we

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.739 align:middle line:10%
imagining a different
sort of world?

00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to close
just by thank you

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:84%
for helping me to
imagine a being where--

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
a civilization where
beings routinely achieve

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
their light body and
making this morphic field

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that much more solid and
accessible for many, many, many

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:90%
more people.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.654 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all very
much for being here.

00:18:39.654 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It's been my pleasure.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.825 align:middle line:84%
And we have a few moments left
for questions and comments.

00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to
talk about this,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd be happy to entertain
those questions.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
thank you very much.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:54.830 --> 00:19:00.715 align:middle line:90%
