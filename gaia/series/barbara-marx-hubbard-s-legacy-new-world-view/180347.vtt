00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Our
Crisis Is a Birth."

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to realize in
evolution that crisis is always

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:90%
an evolutionary driver.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Before something new happens,
the system almost totally

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:84%
breaks down, and
that breakthrough

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
is a signal that it's allowing
something new to break through.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
discovering right now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
is we are facing one of
the greatest crisis we've

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
ever faced, because
we can see it could,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:84%
with climate change
and mass extinction,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:90%
go down to true devolution.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
evolutionary eyes,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
notice that things are
breaking through all over.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And that in one small
instant of time,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:84%
if we say yes to what
breaking through,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
we would find ourselves at
the next stage of evolution.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Recently, we have been
able to get a bird's eye

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
view on the whole
evolutionary story.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's the Big
Bang, and there's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
the quarks and the
electrons and the protons.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And then here is the trajectory
that we have discovered.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Nature has formed single cells.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And out of those
single cells, nature

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
has formed
multicellular organisms.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And out of those
multicellular organisms

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
have come animals and
creatures of all kinds.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And out of that has come
early humans of many kinds,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and out of that has come
Homo sapien sapiens.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you suppose that we're
all that nature can do

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:90%
and that it ends here with us?

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:84%
The answer is it's not
ending here with us.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Something new is
being born through us

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be discovering

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and in the same direction
as evolution has been going.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, evolution goes
toward greater consciousness--

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
single cells to
multi-cells to animal--

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it goes to greater freedom,
as each more complex system is

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
freer than the one
that comes before,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and it goes to more complex
and loving connectivity.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
As for example, a
multi-cell and a human

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and then a planetary
human is more

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:90%
complex than the single cell.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So what we learn from this story
is the trajectory of evolution.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we start projecting
ourselves beyond Homo sapien

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, we can
imagine that we are

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
being able to have more
consciousness, more

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
freedom of choice,
and more complex

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and loving order
with each other.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of that
is it's desirable,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:84%
because almost all
of us would choose

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
more consciousness, more
freedom, and more love

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%
than not.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So as we begin to
learn this story

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and feel the crisis that
could break us down,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
instead of being
depressed and distressed,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
we say, oh, what's
breaking through in me,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in you, in us,
and in the planet?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:90%
And then we find it.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're having such
an obvious breakdown now.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's say climate change
is a serious breakdown.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Species extinction is
another terrible breakdown.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And both of them could
destroy all of life,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:90%
so they're not superficial.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But it is also true, as the
environment is breaking down,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
also, we're learning
how to heal it.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
We're learning how
to transform it.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
We're learning how
to preserve it.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And environments always are
breaking down, but what's good

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
now is that we're able to
preserve, protect, and actually

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
create new sources
of environment

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
through our tremendous
capabilities

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
in greenhouses and in
actual plantings and caring.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:10%
We have had five mass
extinctions, it is said,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:10%
before we got here,
and that has been

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:10%
from looking at the
evolutionary record they've

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:10%
been able to discover this.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:10%
And one interesting
point from this

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:10%
is nature is not interested
in protecting species.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Nature seems to be interested
in protecting purpose.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And since the purpose has been
for more consciousness, more

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
freedom, and more
complex order, out

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
of those five mass extinctions
in all the creatures

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that have died, there has
been continued a progression

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
toward more consciousness,
more freedom, and more order.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So here we are
Homo sapien sapiens

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
at the possible sixth
mass extinction that

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
could lead to the
destruction of all of life

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth,
caused in part by us.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
if you know this story,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that nature uses
mass extinctions

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
to create more consciousness,
more freedom, and more complex

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
order for some
13.7 billion years,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:84%
then you say, what
is there in me

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and us that could
be more conscious,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
that could offer more
freedom, and that

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
is yearning for more
complex order and love?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to find it.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, it's obvious that
we have more consciousness

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:90%
now than we ever did before.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:90%
We have the internet.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:10%
We have a continual--
we have our cell phones.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a continuous
connection on a global scale

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
never had before.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Our production
systems are linked.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.056 align:middle line:84%
Our communication
systems are linked.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Our environmental
systems are linked.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%
We are all integrating.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Nature is doing it, again,
and now we notice that.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the things
is that we have recognized

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:84%
that our crisis is proceeding
into a direction of more

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:90%
connectivity.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt
that we're freer.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think,
I'm 88 years old,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and I'm amazingly free for 88.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And part of it has to do
with health and part of it

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:90%
has to do with purpose.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And part of it has to do with
simply longevity is increasing.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
looking really ahead,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.015 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear that longevity
will increase radically.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people who are

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
in their 30s who say,
well, we may not really

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
have to die on time at
all, because they're

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
discovering more.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And that goes for
longevity, that

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
goes for health, that
goes for consciousness.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an enormous
blossoming of capabilities.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So in the sixth mass
extinction, the first species

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:84%
to know it could
make itself extinct

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
can be the first species
to know it can self-evolve.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing here in
the evolution of evolution

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is saying, how can we
choose to use this crisis

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle line:84%
as a driver for more
consciousness, more

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
freedom, more loving
order, more consciousness?

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And we will find we can do it

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're the very
first species that

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
could say, yes, I'm going
to move toward evolution.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that
in your own life,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
you're going to begin to
feel you have more desire

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
for more love, more
freedom, and more order,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:90%
and you can say yes to it.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can put yourself in
your species, in your colleagues

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and say together, we have
greater consciousness, freedom,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and order than we've
ever had, and you

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
become what I call an agent
for conscious evolution.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is a most
important type,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
because while people are
complaining and afraid

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and in fear, you're the
one who's saying, look,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:90%
we've been through this before.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Now we know how to do it, and
we have these capabilities.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And when we connect
them, we're going

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to discover we have the
capacity for more life, more

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:90%
freedom, and more order.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And in a traditional
spiritual sense,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
you know what you can
say is evolution is good.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not kind, but it's good
if you like more consciousness,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:90%
more freedom, and more order.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
say that it seems

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to be indicating
to every one of us

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that there's more that we can
be and that what we would like

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
in our deepest heart
of hearts is also

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:90%
the direction of evolution.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You could say it's the direction
of spirit, source, impulse

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:90%
of evolution inside you.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
feeling your concern

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure
that I can make it,

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
if you just turn your attention
to that impulse and say,

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:90%
yes, there is more.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I know I have more love.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:90%
I know I have more creativity.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:90%
I know I have more freedom.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%
You'll always be right.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
You're never wrong if
you say that to yourself.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
That part of you that
is available for that

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.230 align:middle line:84%
will turn on, and you will
find yourself ever evolving.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.532 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:10%
This is such a
beautiful diagram,

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:10%
because it shows you
graphically the direction

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:10%
and purpose of evolution
for 13.7 billion years.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
At the origin, you see
the Big Bang, the Mystery.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows really
what happened.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Out of no thing at all comes
everything, potentially,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:90%
that is.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And then as it starts moving
beyond the original protons

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and electrons and
quarks and so forth,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
you will see that out of
this Big Bang, the universe

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.415 align:middle line:90%
as we know it was formed.

00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, this universe has
billions of galaxies

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
with trillions of solar
systems and planetary systems

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:90%
comparable to our own.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're really a creature being
born into a huge and awesome

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:90%
unknown still.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
direction of evolution.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It's Earth, life,
animal life, human life,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and what I like to do is put
an impulse inside the turns

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:84%
on the spiral and that
impulse is the life purpose,

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:90%
is the impulse of creation.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the direction of evolution.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the source, spirit, God,
however you wish to see it,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and the most exciting
thing is it's in you.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.554 align:middle line:84%
It's your desire for more
life, more creativity,

00:11:47.554 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and when you say
yes to it, you're

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
saying yes to an
awesome power that's

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:90%
your power if you notice it.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, we go up into our
turn on the spiral,

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and if you let it
go up, you go right

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
to the heart of the
hub of the wheel

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
there and feel yourself
feeling the love

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of that innate capacity for
your own heart's desire.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Feel that as the
place inside you

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that wants more, loves
more, creates more,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:90%
and you know what's helping you?

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:90%
The entire impulse of evolution.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:90%
All that's required is your yes.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you find other people
inside that core of the spiral

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
there at the heart, and you
will discover genius code,

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:90%
and we'll talk about that later.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But in this overview,
you will discover

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that you have far more genius
than you know and your genius

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
won't be awakened without your
heart's desire being turned on,

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:90%
which is really nice.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
the whole thing

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
called planetary DNA, which
we'll talk about later, where

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
you will put the projects
that come out of you to create

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:90%
a better world.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine that to be the
structure of the new society

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:84%
beyond capitalism,
communism, socialism,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
or mutually assured
destruction, which

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
has been a mode of
operation, which we've

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
had to protect each other.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
If you assume it to be
made up of what you create

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and of what people like you
create, coming from people's

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
heart's desire, turning
on our genius code,

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I can clearly envision that
we're creating a new society.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And if enough of us say yes to
it, there's nothing to stop us.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
direction of evolution

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to go to higher consciousness,
freedom, and order.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized when I
discovered that in my own life

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
was a tremendous willingness to
affirm my deepest motivations

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying
that's too much.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I remember my brother
said to me, what, Barbara?

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
You think you could have
an effect on evolution?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:90%
He thought I was crazy.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, I am evolution.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:90%
You are evolution.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Evolution becomes
conscious in you and me.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:90%
This is awesome.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
When you say yes to the
impulse of evolution within you

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that coincides with that spiral
of evolution going through all,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
you become one with the
universal process itself.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
In traditional language it's
like becoming one with God.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've always personally felt
that that impulse inside me

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:84%
was spiritual, was
awesomely beautiful,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and it is what goes
through everything

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and it definitely does
not stop with you and me.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.180 align:middle line:10%
Teilhard de Chardin was a
Catholic Jesuit paleontologist

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:10%
never published by the
church in his lifetime.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
literally turned me

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
on to evolution when I read his
book "The Phenomenon of Man."

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And here's what he said.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:10%
He discovered the
direction of evolution,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:10%
as we have mentioned,
that it appears

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:10%
to go to more consciousness,
greater freedom of choice,

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:10%
like a single cell to
multi-cell to animal,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:10%
and greater complexity
and connectivity or love,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:10%
and he saw that when that
happens at any scale,

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:10%
there would be what he
called the Christification

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
There would be a planetary
awakening in love.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
There would be a tremendous
arousal for planet Earth.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I read that,
I thought, that's my purpose.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was about 33 years
old, with five children,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.942 align:middle line:84%
living in Connecticut
a little bit depressed.

00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:05.926 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
realized, first of all,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the direction that evolution has
been going in-- consciousness,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:90%
freedom, and order--

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the
way I want to go.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very
important, because that

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
means every one of us has within
us the impulse toward greater

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, freedom, and
order, and as any human being,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
is probably more than
you think you can do.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
However, it isn't, because
that in you that's doing it,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%
all it needs is your yes.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:90%
You're not making it up.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
You didn't make up
your own intelligence.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You didn't make up
your own capacities,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
but you do have the freedom
of saying yes or no.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more yeses that you
can engender, as we shall see,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%
you're going to become a human.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And you're going
to become something

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:10%
that has only existed in
the vision of the greatest

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:10%
people in the past.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:10%
If you look around
in the world today,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:10%
you don't see most leaders
feeling that they know

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:10%
what to do about the crises.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the
presidents, do you

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
see the public
officials say, I know

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
what to do but about
this evolutionary crisis?

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't, in
general, even know

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%
it's an evolutionary crisis.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.219 align:middle line:84%
They think it's a problem, and
they're trying to solve it.

00:17:39.219 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
it's not even going

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to be possible to be solved,
and there's a lot of pessimism

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
know that evolution

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
uses crises to go to higher
order of creativity and love,

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know
that, it's very hard

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to imagine that you can
stop population explosion

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and climate change
problems and species

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:90%
extinction all by yourself.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a trend
toward destruction.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
If you don't see the trend
toward evolution, which

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:84%
is more people, think
of the Millennials,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
more consciousness, more
free, more creative,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
with the internet
making us into a living

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
system, if you
don't notice that,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:90%
that is evolution at work.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:84%
If you don't notice that
we can now extend life.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:90%
We can deal with our health.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
We can go into our spacecraft.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:10%
We can contact other life by
ourselves becoming other life.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't notice the positive
aspects of your evolution,

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
you will be unnecessarily
depressed and not

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:84%
only unnecessarily
depressed, but you

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
will act without the possibility
of your own evolution.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of
many people now.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So one very important
point of the story

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.865 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution of evolution
is to know you are evolution.

00:19:06.865 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
What I realize is
that evolution works

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:84%
towards greater consciousness,
more freedom, more

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
complex order, that the
consciousness inside me

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and you is actually
evolution itself.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the intelligence,
on the interior of evolution

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:84%
from quarks and electrons
and protons and no thing

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
at all, to you and I having
this enormous ability,

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.709 align:middle line:90%
how do you think that happened?

00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could say God
is intelligent and did it

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But if we say it's the
impulse of evolution

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
from within life itself, and you
are obviously from within life

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.050 align:middle line:90%
itself--

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I changed from depression,
serious depression,

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
into the awareness that I am
capable of conscious evolution

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and that I have the desire to
go in the direction evolution's

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
going in.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like against
the natural tendency

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
toward devolution.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
in my mid '30s,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:90%
I became a different person.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:10%
It was only in the 1960s
that some radio astronomers,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:10%
somewhat by accident, discovered
the earliest frequencies

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:10%
of the Big Bang, what's
called the Big Bang,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:10%
and that itself is a mystery.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And they did not know that
the universe had been,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:90%
was now, and is always evolving.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Einstein thought it
was eternal universe.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
biggest story never told.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:84%
We thought, the
churches thought,

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.495 align:middle line:84%
the schools, the
universities thought,

00:20:57.495 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the entire library of
human evolution, nobody

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
realized that the entire
universe is evolving.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I realized this is probably
the most awesome news

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that the entire human species
has had in modern history,

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has
been and is now evolving.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that we, ourselves, are

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
part of an evolving universe.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It means that the direction
of evolution inside

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
you and me is the
direction of billions

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:90%
of years of intelligence.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And far from being unintelligent
and not knowing what to do,

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:84%
when we say yes, we
find that we know more.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:90%
We just have to take--

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
we have to be
encouraged to take more,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
evolution of evolution.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's just to note, this
is not told in the churches.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It is not told in
the universities.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's one major
public leader in the world that

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:90%
is operating out of this story.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't know it,
because it's that new,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and the traditional
universities don't teach it.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I found out about
it, I was absolutely thrilled.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, wait
till I go to Bryn Mawr College

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and find out how to
evolve more consciously.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.642 align:middle line:84%
And as you will see later,
I went to Bryn Mawr.

00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They say, what class
do you want to take,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and what job do you
want to have later?

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I
don't want that yet.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I want to know which
direction we're evolving in

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and where's my vocation?

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:84%
In the big universities,
that's not the question.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not even asked.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was with Eleanor
Dulles and the head of Bryn

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Mawr University, which
was Sargent Shriver, very

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:90%
illustrious.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I somehow got in that board
meeting, and I said somewhat--

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and Buckminster Fuller
was scholar in residence.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was a little bit encouraged
by Buckminster Fuller,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:90%
a lot encouraged.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think we need a
whole new course at Bryn Mawr.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And Eleanor Dulles
got up on her back.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean a new course?

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I said it has to do with
the evolution of evolution

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
from the billions of years of
the past in the direction going

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And Eleanor Dulles said
to me, I beg your pardon.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:90%
We have history.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, this is not history.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
This is emergent reality.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized at Bryn Mawr,
I just sat in my room and read.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Now when I met one
person who got it,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:90%
his name was Dr. Jonas Salk.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And Jonas Salk
called me up one day,

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and he invited me for lunch,
because I had written something

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:90%
that he liked.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I saw him,
something happened in me.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:90%
And he began to tell me--

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I told him everything
that was wrong with me.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I thought there was more coming.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:90%
I had more to do.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I had five children,
but nonetheless, I

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:84%
was just beginning, and there
was something more happening.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:28.781 align:middle line:84%
And I looked pretty
much neurotic.

00:24:28.781 --> 00:24:29.723 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:29.723 --> 00:24:33.962 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.962 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:90%
And he said, Barbara, no.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:90%
You are a mutant.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You combine the characteristics
needed by evolution now.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he's the great
biologist Dr. Jonas Salk.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And the minute he
said that to me, I

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
realized that all these things
that seemed wrong with me

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
actually were the impulse of
evolution that had no name.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, there
was no understanding of it.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So with that, being
a mutant, then I

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
realized I'm not the only
one, but a lot of us who

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
had that sense of greater
possibility, greater freedom,

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
greater order were
considered, at that time

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s and '70s, we
became the protesters.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We became the black
power leaders.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We became the importance
of the women's movement.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
All of that was
important, but instead

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of joining those particular
vital movements, instead of--

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I became-- I joined the
evolutionary movement.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being a protester
or even women's first,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I became a woman
who was a mutant.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we'll
see as this story goes

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
on that more and
more of the women who

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:84%
had to fight for those
rights in those days but--

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:90%
we're here now.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:90%
This is 20, 30 years later.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The women are highly evolving
humans and so are the men.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:90%
We are new humans.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We're coming into
a new humanity.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the best analogies
of this is birth.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm a mother of
five, and I remember

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:84%
when I was being led
into the delivery room

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
with one of my babies,
I said to the nurse,

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
if I did not know I was giving
birth, I'd think I was dying.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%
In other words, it's painful.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we we learn
in physical birth,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that the pain is
essential for the birth.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when you're
an expectant mother

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:90%
and you get a pain, it's a pain.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I'm going to the hospital.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I went there early a
few times, because I

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:90%
was so excited at the pain.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's put it to
the planetary birth

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:10%
of a planetary organism.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:90%
The pain is serious.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And in general, it's not
interpreted by hardly anybody

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:84%
as giving birth to the next
stage of human culture.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But when you do, you respond
very differently to the pain,

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:84%
because you say, what's
breaking through?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do is you look
at that wheel of co-creation,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and you see health,
education, economics, science,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And as we will discuss
later on, you simply

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:84%
go, what's breaking
through in every sector

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of the wheel of
co-creation, which

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:90%
is our turn on the spiral?

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you connect
that which is

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:84%
creative in every
sector of the wheel,

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
you actually see the new
world being born in our midst.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we saw the
five mass extinctions

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and know that we ourselves
are at the threshold

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
of the sixth mass
extinction and yet,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
we see the direction
of evolution

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:84%
toward more consciousness,
more freedom, more order, what

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:84%
we have to say is that
nature extincts species

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:90%
but nature preserves purpose.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And she will get rid of millions
of species but out of it,

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:84%
for all these billions
of years of breakdowns,

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
has come more and more
consciousness, more freedom.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, taking
our time on the spiral,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
we're facing the
biggest breakdown

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:90%
that humans have ever faced.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It's so dangerous that
if we don't respond well,

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
we can go extinct, and
nature will not preserve us.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
However, if enough
of us are up here

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
seeing what's breaking
through in every field,

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in every endeavor,
and mainly seeing

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
what's breaking through in our
hearts, in our heart's desire--

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'll talk a lot about that
vocational arousal, enjoining

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
genius.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And nature invented sexuality.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:90%
She's inventing suprasex now.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:84%
How did nature get us to
reproduce the species up

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:90%
to maximum?

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.348 align:middle line:84%
She really had to
make it feel good.

00:29:20.348 --> 00:29:21.336 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:21.336 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I will discuss this
in a little while,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:84%
nature is making it feel
good to find your own genius,

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:84%
enjoin genius, and say
yes to your creativity.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:84%
You will feel good
when you say that.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Once I realized from
Teilhard de Chardin

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and from the discovery
of the Big Bang

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and the direction of evolution
that the direction of evolution

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
is to love more, create
more, be more, and do more.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So as this depressed
little girl that I

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
was, young woman
with my five children

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and the house, the dogs,
the cats, the husband,

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and everything that I
should totally love,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that depression
made me feel guilty.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:90%
How dare I be depressed?

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I was a fortunate person
I wasn't starving.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't living in
a war-torn area.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Why should I--

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I felt guilty.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But then I understood
when I was able to say yes

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to my deeper consciousness,
freedom, and order,

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the reason I could say
yes is I discovered

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:90%
the nature of evolution.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I discovered I am evolution.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:90%
You are evolution.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And I am evolution,
become conscious of myself

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:90%
as evolution.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, the awesome
truth to that is I

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and you become aware of
yourself as evolution,

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that evolution has the wisdom
and genius and brilliance

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
of the 13.7 billion years
of effort is in you.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
any of us have fully

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:84%
manifested the quality of the
extent of the genius encoded

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.620 align:middle line:90%
in us.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
That calls us into
action to become a,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I would say, a communication
vehicle of conscious evolution.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:10%
So my greatest purpose now is
to create a site of co-creation

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:10%
and internet possibility,
where everybody--

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:10%
and we'll talk
about that later--

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:10%
who has that feeling
of conscious evolution

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:10%
inside themselves,
I would like to have

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:10%
them identify themselves
and place themselves

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:10%
on that wheel of co-creation.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you in health?

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you in education?

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Are you in politics?

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Place yourself there,
and you'll meet others.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know what happens
to you when you meet others?

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:84%
You'll find, like Jonas
Salk called me a mutant,

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:90%
I never got--

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I was better ever
since he said that.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to be,
like Jonas was to me,

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
if you are in any
way a mutant now,

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be an internet
channel for you to just check

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:84%
in, say what you want to create,
say what you need to create it.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere on Earth, there's
somebody who's looking for you.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do right now
is connect the evolutionaries

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and then discover the
direction of evolution

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:84%
through those who seem to
have been able to say yes

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:90%
in their own hearts.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:84%
What will be birthed
out of bringing together

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:84%
our new powers of love
within the new capacities

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of humanities is a
new species, and I'm

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:90%
calling it Homo universalis.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're
becoming a new species.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason to assume
that Homo sapien sapiens is

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the very last that
nature could do

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to say stop here.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
nature could stop.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, nature isn't stopping
with Homo sapien sapiens.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:10%
The very brilliant
people in, let's say,

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:10%
Singularity University and
other types of growing edge

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:10%
capabilities are giving
us the capacities

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:10%
we used to call
gods, I would like

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:10%
to call it an impulse
of evolutionary love,

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:10%
that evolutionary
love is what brings

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:10%
particles to particles all the
way up and all the way down.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So evolution is
a huge love story

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:84%
that is painful and difficult
and dangerous but great.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It is my assumption that we
have been given high-tech genius

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're supposed to infuse
it with evolutionary love,

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and that ultimately,
the humans are

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
meant to become what
we used to call gods.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That is to say we can
restore the Earth.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
We can heal and free people
from hunger, disease, and more.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:90%
We should be doing that.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:84%
We can start exploring
the further reaches

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.159 align:middle line:90%
of our own inner mind.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're in a universe of
billions of galaxies, folks.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:10%
So I would like to see us
develop our space programs.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I'd like us to be--

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm a member of something called
the Galactic University to be

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.239 align:middle line:90%
ready for contact if there is.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:10%
In other words, to take
that wheel of co-creation,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.330 align:middle line:10%
find out what's working
here on this Earth,

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:10%
connect it and heal the
Earth, number one, and free

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:10%
the people who are
hungry, diseased,

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.900 align:middle line:10%
and in war, number two.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And number three,
start finding out

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.000 align:middle line:84%
who you can be as a
co-creative human.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And then let's
look at the growing

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
edge in that wheel in
health, education, economics.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And let's draw a very wonderful
circle around the growing edge,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and then let's bring the
growing edge of people together

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:84%
to have a planetary
awakening in love that

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:90%
will change the world.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:90%
