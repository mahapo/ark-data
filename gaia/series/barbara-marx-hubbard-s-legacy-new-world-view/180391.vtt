our creativity for
the good of ourselves

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.583 align:middle line:84%
and the whole of
Earth's family."

00:00:53.583 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:10%
I was feeling depressed.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:10%
And I felt guilty
because I was depressed.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I was well-off,
and I was taken care of well.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I realized
that in the United States,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
our goal was life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
was that I decided

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to see if I could find somebody
who was happy in Lakeville,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Connecticut--

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really happy.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So I called on all my different
friends with, tell me--

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:90%
are you really happy?

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what's
happiness really like?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And the friend said,
well, I'm comfortable.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little bit depressed
about x, y, or z.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find anybody
who was really happy.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I reinvented
Thomas Jefferson.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
We hold these truths
to be self-evident--

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:90%
that all people are free.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.611 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh.

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it in a new way.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
All people are being
creative, endowed

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
by our creator with
this inalienable right

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and responsibility to
express our creativity

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
for the good of ourselves
and the whole human family.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And how come I'm not doing it?

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Why am I depressed?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was fortunate to read
a book that changed my life.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a book by Abraham Maslow.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's called "Toward
a Psychology of Being."

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
He's the first psychiatrist
in modern times

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
to study wellness
rather than illness.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And he went to see what
makes a person happy.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And he called it
"self-actualizing."

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
That was his word for well-off,
fulfilled, actualizing

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And here was his
simple description.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Every self-actualizing person
has one thing in common--

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
chosen work that they find
intrinsically self-rewarding

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and of service to
at least one other.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
That's about the
best description

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of what makes a person feel
fulfilled and happy that I

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
had ever read.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I read
it, I realized, now

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%
I know what's wrong with me.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.922 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a vocation.

00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I feel confident
because I did not 10 years ago.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.114 align:middle line:90%
We have a new image of man.

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:42.783 align:middle line:90%
We have a new image of society.

00:03:42.783 --> 00:03:45.514 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:47.735 align:middle line:90%
And I think I place first.

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:52.446 align:middle line:84%
And then out of this, we
have a new image of religion.

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a real revolution.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Abraham Maslow
gave this advice.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Be bold.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Do what attracts you.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So at that time,
it appeared to me

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that there was only one
thing that attracted me.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It was Abraham Maslow himself.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, OK.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll be bold.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
I'll call him up and
invite him for lunch.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:90%
And I was in Connecticut.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I would
meet you in New York.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I want to take you to lunch.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:90%
You have saved my life.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote him a
very good letter

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
about how I had been looking
for purpose and so forth.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So he came to lunch.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I told him this
yearning in my heart

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:90%
for greater purpose, actually.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And I realized he gave
me what I was missing,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:90%
which was to call it vocation.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And vocation is unique
to every person.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It's what really you do
best, what you're born to do.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a job.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not just any old thing.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's what you do best.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what it was.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But Maslow said,
I think, Barbara,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:90%
that you represent life.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I want to give you something.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a list of 300
names of prominent people.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
He called it the Eupsychian
Good Soul Network.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just want to
give them to you because maybe

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
you'll know what to do.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:10%
So I go back to
Lakeville, Connecticut,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:10%
on the train with 300 names--

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:10%
Ervin LÃ¡szlÃ³, Thomas Merton, all
these really marvelous people.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.948 align:middle line:90%
I had not met anybody.

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:90%
So what should I do?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I
thought of doing.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
them all a letter.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask
each one of them, what

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
do you think is the next
step for the future good

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
of humanity?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And I will publish what
you write to me if I really

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:90%
like it.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I will create a
newsletter on your idea

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:90%
of what the next step is.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%
I called it the "center letter."

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I typed it up myself.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I mailed it from
Limerock, Connecticut,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and put this letter in
the mail to 300 people.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And I started to get letters.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:90%
People responded.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what a good idea.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here's what I
think, and on and on.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of them who appeared in
person was Lancelot Law Whyte.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
He wrote "The Next
Development in Man."

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:10%
And Lancelot Law Whyte
began to really delve

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:10%
into the philosophy behind
evolutionary thought.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And he became a very deep
friend and colleague.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say I
recognize that my vocation is

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to discover and express
that which is emergent,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that which is created
in other people

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:90%
and in the world as a whole.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I crossed over
into the new species--

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
from the depressed
housewife in Lakeville

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
with the five children
and a wonderful husband,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
crossed over because that
inner impulse inside me

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:90%
was turned on.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I knew how to do
something about it--

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:90%
not everything, but something.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to say that for
every single person on Earth,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:90%
there is an impulse there.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's not so easy.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what it is,
do what attracts you first,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:90%
even if it's not it.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Because what attracts
you will take you

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to something else
that attracts you.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't jump off a cliff.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't do something radical.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I invited somebody to lunch.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:90%
You do that which attracts you.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would swear
without any doubt

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:84%
inside of you is that
unique, creative vocation.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:10%
I love my husband, my
children, my house, my garden.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But vocation is
something deeper.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It's your calling.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It is given to you, I feel,
by that impulse of evolution,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:90%
which is uniquely you.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Most people might definitely
feel that their vocation is

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:90%
to pay the bills to stay alive.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing--

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to
be paying the bills.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
If you can possibly find
and include in your day

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that which has turned
you on to do it,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
that which gives you vocational
arousal, what will happen

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is you'll probably be better
at that than you are at doing

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:90%
something you don't care about.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And as old jobs
are fading away--

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
for very good reason because
they're repetitive and robotic,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and yes it's true robots are
taking over robotic work--

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:90%
over here is entrepreneurship.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Over here is creativity.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Over here is uniqueness.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Over here is saying yes to
that life impulse within you.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And your yes can change more of
the world and give more to you

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
than you're doing that
which is not yours to do.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I want you to do a simple thing.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Invite one, two,
three, or more friends

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
together and visually
tell them about the spiral

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:90%
of evolution and the wheel.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Just tell them in five minutes.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:10%
And tell them
they're going to sit

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:10%
at the heart of the
hub of the wheel.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:10%
And tell them that that
impulse of evolution

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:10%
that goes from single cell
to multi-cell to animal

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:10%
is going through them.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, they may not believe
you, but it's true.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So eventually you learn to be
a communicator, number one.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Then, while you're
sitting in a small circle,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
here's a question that you ask
yourself and each other person.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple question.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.455 align:middle line:84%
What is my deepest
heart's desire?

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
You will discover that
almost nobody knows.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:90%
They know, yes, I have a job.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am interested in
geology or yes, this or that.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But deepest heart's
desire is hidden

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:90%
in a very interesting way.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It only seems to want to come
out in a field of resonance.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, the two or three or
more resonance is resounding.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying my
deepest heart's desire

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who's not
paying attention to me.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I almost can't do it.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm here
with you, and I feel

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that you're
empathetic with me, I

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
find that it's like
I can hear something.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my deepest heart's desire--

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
you know what it is?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll tell.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
My deepest heart's
desire is I want

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
to be on a huge internet
program on the new news.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to have all the people
with something new to tell.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell this.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the people listening
to me-- they say, really?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:90%
My deepest heart's desire is--

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
bring out something

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't fully,
fully think before.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:90%
And we go around.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is because
they're in a resonant field

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:84%
together, they fall in
love with each other.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So resonance creates
a field of love

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
which gives you the capacity to
tune in to your deepest heart's

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:90%
desire.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's because you
can't just do it

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in the service of
your mental mind.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the second question.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Once people start to get
their deepest heart's desire

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're feeling
resonance and love,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the next question is, what is
my unique genius to realize

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:90%
my deepest heart's desire?

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Here's a really
interesting secret.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Your genius code stays hidden
until your deepest heart's

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:90%
desire is revealed.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And then out of that
deepest heart's desire

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
comes unique genius
that you might not

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:84%
have even noticed before
because it doesn't come out

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:90%
in daily life.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't get a job for it.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily get
paid for it right away.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
But let's say it is your
deepest heart's desire,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
like mine to create a
planetary birth experience.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Once I say it, then
I begin to learn

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
more of how to do it
because my deepest

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:90%
heart's desire kind of unfurls.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And since I know it is in
the nature of evolution,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
it is growing forward, not
only just by myself alone.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens is
it happens to everybody

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.611 align:middle line:90%
else in the small group.

00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Their heart's desire
starts to come out.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.025 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell
you that if you're

00:13:54.025 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
sitting at the heart of the hub
of the wheel with a few friends

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
doing that, and you're willing
to continue to do it and start

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
describing it, and if you're
part of a community that

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
wants to know more, I would
say, of other co-creators,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
you can become a
co-creator by doing this.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you step
out, and you go

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
into planetary DNA, which is
the next turn on that spiral.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I am going
to start communicating

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
this on television, which
actually I'm doing right now.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I am doing my heart's
desire right now.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Oh, other people will do
their heart's desire wherever,

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
is open to your yes.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:90%
You have to try it out.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, yes, I'm going
to call Abraham Maslow.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I wrote to all these
different people.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:90%
They said yes.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
where the yes is.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And this yes is very,
very interesting.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I call it internally
"the compass of joy."

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that
you do that isn't joyful.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you find your deepest
heart's desire and the genius

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
code in you that is awakened by
that, you're going to feel joy.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
feel enthusiastic.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel creative.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel,
wow, I'm excited.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I call that whole set of
feelings your compass of joy.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, over here is your
compass of stress.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing what I like.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to work,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.519 align:middle line:84%
You could stay there
if you want to.

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But you could stop, because
here's where choice comes in.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
If you just choose
because now you

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
know that you have a
compass of joy that

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
includes this kind of behavior,
you know enough to do it again.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens is after
a while of saying yes,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:84%
the compass of joy
becomes a way of life.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might sound
overly idealistic.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But here's why it
isn't idealistic.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It's realistic.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The realism is that
nature's impulse to create--

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
if we've seen it for
billions of years--

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that impulse is going to greater
consciousness, more freedom,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
more complex order.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It actually is attracting
you to find out

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
how you have more consciousness,
more freedom, and more order.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, how you do it is
your compass of joy

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%
because it only is you.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, for example,
I'm a communicator more

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:90%
than I'm a writer, for example.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
Now, I write in my
journal every single day.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you what I do.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I learned to say,
mental mind, here's

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
the situation, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
This is over here, doesn't work.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Then over here, I say, dearly
beloved, tell me what it means.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And I turn on higher mind,
and I write without thinking.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like I can speak
without thinking

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:90%
when I'm in higher mind.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I speak, but it's not
that I speak gibberish.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I speak the best
I've ever spoken

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
if I'm coming from deep mind.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So you will discover it not only
in the small group, not only

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
your compass of joy,
but your journal.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And you then begin to
ask with your mental mind

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:84%
when something doesn't
feel right and something is

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
awkward or difficult or painful
to you, write it clearly.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I use double
quotation marks.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I say, tell me what this means.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm calling on that.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
You can call it anything
you want to call it.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:90%
I call it "dearly beloved."

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.202 align:middle line:90%
Dearly beloved.

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I've written 202
volumes of journal.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm really good at this.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.116 align:middle line:84%
The reason I know what
you do is because I ask.

00:18:34.116 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And what comes out sometimes
from dearly beloved

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
is such a clear
description of what

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to do that I then
bring in mental mind.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:90%
It says, really?

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't know that.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Then dearly beloved
speaks again.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So you will find inside of you
the compass of joy if you ask.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I learned that when higher
mind describes the response

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to my question of what to
do where I'm not feeling

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:84%
comfortable, the higher mind
has the ability to explain it

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:90%
in such a way that I relax.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
word "epiphany."

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
An epiphany is an "a-ha."

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, even if it's
not right there

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
going to make you feel better,
if you know, let's say,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
cruel to somebody

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and you have caused
that person to hurt you,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
maybe you didn't
know or didn't want

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to admit that you
had hurt somebody.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So the a-ha is, oh,
I was inadvertently

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
cruel to somebody.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is
you stop mental mind.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Call somebody up.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Write somebody a letter
and get together.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:90%
And then you go back to journal.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what happened?

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:90%
You're writing now, you see.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I did call somebody
up, and we met.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
This person was waiting
for me to call, et cetera.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So you enter into a profound
dialogue within yourself.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have discovered
that I like to talk.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%
That's my vocation.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But I might want to talk
all by myself to myself.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have to find somebody
who is interested in what

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.544 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about.

00:20:42.544 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I find one or
two that really gets excited

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:90%
when they hear me.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to me
when this person gets

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:84%
excited by what I'm doing,
particularly if this person

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:84%
says, I've been
longing to hear this,

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping to find this out,
you feel vocational arousal.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, vocational arousal is the
next step after sexual arousal.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
When you would like to go to bed
with somebody-- sexual arousal.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Vocational arousal-- you want
to create with that person.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:84%
You want to not
procreate, but co-create.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And you become a co-creator
through vocational arousal.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you can find somebody
whose genius actually activates

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
your genius, you begin to join
genius with this other person.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
out of joining genius

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:84%
comes a new human and a
new species eventually--

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
not just from doing it once,
but the finding of somebody

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
whose unique calling needs
your unique expression

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
of your own unique calling and
that together, you join genius.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The explosion of energy there
is enough to bring forth in you

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.386 align:middle line:90%
the newness that you are.

00:22:20.386 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like if sperm
doesn't hit egg.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
get the new baby.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So if the geniuses
don't join just right,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
you may not discover the newness
that you intrinsically are.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
be more than you

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:90%
were when you came together.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you
get vocational arousal.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have what I'm calling
"suprasexual co-creation."

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume for
the moment that nature

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
is inventing something
as great as sex

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.872 align:middle line:90%
to get us to join genius.

00:23:03.872 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a big
thought right there.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, nature would have
to invent something

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to get us to join genius.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back
just for a moment

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.176 align:middle line:90%
to the first single cells.

00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
anybody knows it,

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
but single cells existed for
a couple of billion years

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:90%
before anything else.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And they were doing great.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
But solar energy came in,
burned up the single cells,

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and they had to divide.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
to join each other

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to handle the solar energy.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm making a very
complex story short.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, they had

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to invent sexuality,
because they couldn't

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.764 align:middle line:90%
divide to reproduce any more.

00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know the
history of sexuality.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
journey of sexuality

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that entities have developed,
all kinds of sexuality.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm making a
huge statement here.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
When nature doesn't
need more babies

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
with only chosen
children, over here,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:90%
what does nature really need?

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:90%
New humans.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Nature really needs
better people.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Nature needs people capable
of doing their best.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And if nature is over
here creating sexuality

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because you have to fall in
love with somebody to have

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that baby, over here, if you
really want to join genius

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and you want to participate
in suprasexual co-creation,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
you have to find geniuses
that turn you on.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to find others
whose vocation arouses you.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to find
others who you arouse.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of
suprasexual co-creation

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
is a tremendous
liberation of genius.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And out of it comes
lots of new people.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And if I can just take a
projection of my highest goal,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
it would be a
planetary experience

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.094 align:middle line:90%
of vocational arousal.

00:25:06.094 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:84%
If you could think for this
moment of the number of people

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:84%
on this planet
who would actually

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
like to connect with you
to do what you want to do,

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and there are thousands of
them, and you come together

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
in clusters, and you're
turning on the world,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:84%
did you still think we're going
to run out of energy and die?

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Through suprasex, we're going
to evolve and co-create.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that together,
you have a new species.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And as that keeps
growing, there's

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:84%
a juiciness that starts to
happen into people's lives.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to them is
they start to get healthier.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:90%
They start to live longer.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at me.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm 88 years old.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:90%
How am I doing this?

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
health and epigenetics.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:10%
And we know epigenetics,
invented by Bruce Lipton,

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:10%
is the idea that
the DNA of your cell

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:10%
is affected by the consciousness
that you are feeling.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you affect and turn

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:84%
on or off the DNA
code of intelligence

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
by the surrounding
consciousness.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So here is an
assumption I'm making--

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that if you are turned on
by your vocational arousal

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and joining genius and your
enthusiastic enthusiasm filled

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
with godhood, what happens
is that your cells say,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
oh, let's keep it
going for a while.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she's got more to do.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she's excited.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA, as you age, if
you start joining genius

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
to become more of who
you are and to give

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.710 align:middle line:84%
more of your creativity
into the world,

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
your DNA is very likely

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.482 align:middle line:90%
to make you feel emergent.

00:27:06.482 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And some people
say to me, Barbara,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:90%
do you feel older or younger?

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And I say, no, I feel newer.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And I mean really newer.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.386 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're joining genius
here, you are getting newer.

00:27:20.386 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like you for
joining genes, you're

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.720 align:middle line:84%
going to have a new baby, if
you join genius, this happens.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to take a jump here
to what education could really

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.544 align:middle line:90%
become.

00:27:30.544 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going
to say, I'm going

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to go and take this course
or this course or this course

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and get a job here and
there and elsewhere, I

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
would love to see these
wonderful institutions develop

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that into, what is
your passion to create?

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:90%
What is your greatest vocation?

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Who else needs what
you have to give?

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And we start to do
vocational arousal

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:90%
at an educational level.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And what would come from
this is awesome intelligence.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:90%
So what happens when you're 50?

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And it used to be old.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that
women over 50 felt

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
they were getting
less beautiful,

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were
getting near death.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
They might have been a
grandparent of many children,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:84%
but it was not the highest
point in your life.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a very different story.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
When a woman gets to
be 50, she probably

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have five
to ten children.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Very few of us do.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:90%
She might have one or two.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:90%
I had five.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But I got to 50, and the five
children were all flourishing.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 50 years old.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And what happened to me?

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:90%
I had no more eggs.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.796 align:middle line:90%
I realized I'm the egg.

00:28:47.796 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered is I wanted
to give birth to something

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:90%
creative that I wanted to do.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
when I met Jonas Salk,

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and I read Pierre du Chardin.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
that I have inside

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
myself this desire of
conscious evolution.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And once I then said,
I'm going to give birth

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to this consciousness
as I would give birth

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to a baby, what
happens to a woman is

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:90%
she nurtures that impulse--

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:84%
a little bit
differently than a man

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
does sometimes
because she doesn't

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.552 align:middle line:90%
have to be competitive with it.

00:29:28.552 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you get pregnant,
you don't have to say,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's a better
baby than anybody else.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a baby.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:84%
A woman's body is actually
capable of producing a baby.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So I am just assuming that in
regenopause, a woman's body

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is capable of producing
creativity that

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:84%
has a quality of
gentle lovingness

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that is more difficult
for a man to have.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not that men don't have it.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have the
body because, really, they

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:90%
are projecting.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:90%
They are winning.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:90%
They are saving.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
They are handling
things, whereas women

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
are being taken care of.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're having
babies and all of this.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So then they're 50, 60, 70,
80, and they're not dying.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Regenopause-- I realized
when I was about 60,

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:84%
this is a new phase
of life that I'm in.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's no limit to
how old I need to be.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no limit to what I'm
supposed to have accomplished.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Nobody actually knows what
I should do at 70 or 80.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And so a woman has
the freedom to just do

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:90%
more of what's creative.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she
meets other women.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, if she's really lucky,
she meets an evolutionary man.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And maybe she wants one.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But that evolutionary man
needs to have discovered

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:90%
his own evolutionary potential.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're coming
together to procreate.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
They're coming
together to co-create.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you are fortunate enough
to be in regenopause, giving

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
birth to that seedling
which is your own,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and you meet a man
who's also giving birth

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to the seedling that
is his own, and then

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:84%
you join together
for a shared purpose,

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:90%
you become truly blessed.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And you become energized.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And you become filled
with excitement.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you say yes to
this, and you're saying yes

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to your own DNA that is
wanting to do more, love

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
more, and create more, and
you're getting older and older,

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but your body is being
affected by the DNA which

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:84%
knows there's more to
do, I don't feel any age.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, my body is older.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:90%
But my impulse is not.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.465 align:middle line:84%
And one's impulse
is not age-related.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:84%
If it's authentically
what you want to become.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and do, this can happen
to a teenager sometimes.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It can happen to a young
woman, like my granddaughter.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But it can happen to
an 88-year-old woman.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, the age-relatedness
seems to disappear here.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And along with that
comes life extension.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:90%
So you're not dying necessarily.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And if the people
are right saying

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we can extend life
for x number of years,

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:84%
then the creativity
can be extended.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this is
what the planet needs.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The new species of
co-creators are creators.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And they are creating what they
are uniquely gifted to create.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you can imagine
an entire species

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:84%
with individuals
discovering life purpose,

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
saying yes, and creating it
in every field of endeavor

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:90%
connected--

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:84%
in health, education, economics,
science, and technology--

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
with the new technologies,
you know what, folks?

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:90%
We're the new species.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.171 align:middle line:90%
