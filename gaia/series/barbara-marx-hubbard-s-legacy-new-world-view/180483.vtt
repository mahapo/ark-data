00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.455 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "The Powers
of Ancient Gods."

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:10%
So what's really happening
as we humans have powers

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:10%
that we used to attribute
to Zeus or Athena

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:10%
or the Greek mythology gods?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, we've got these powers
of our so-called ancient gods,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and we're being given, by
the process of evolution

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
or by spirit, or
however you want

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
to see it-- by the great
creating process itself,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
we are being given
powers that are godlike.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:90%
We can destroy this Earth.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:90%
We can evolve this planet.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:90%
We can extend our life.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:90%
We can go into space.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:90%
We can seek other life.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:84%
These are powers
of ancient gods.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've said our crisis
is a birth, and most of us

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.362 align:middle line:90%
don't like it.

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever saw a baby
who's just being born,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
they don't like it either.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult. And
it's not until that baby

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:84%
is held in its mother's arms and
is able to breathe and realize

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:84%
it's going to survive
that it actually begins

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
to open its collective eyes.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:10%
And what I think we're doing now
is just barely opening our eyes

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:10%
to what could be considered
the miracle and glory of being

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:10%
given powers that we used
to attribute to gods,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:10%
and that somehow the great
creating process has given

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:10%
our generation of humans
the powers either to destroy

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:10%
our planetary life support
system or the powers to heal

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.158 align:middle line:10%
and to evolve and to become
"godlike," in old terms.

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:10%
So we happen to live at
the exact moment in history

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:10%
when the mythology
of our ancient gods

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:10%
is actually being given to us
in this generation of humans.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And we don't yet have
the story clearly

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
in our own consciousness
to understand

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of our power.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So one reason why I want us to
understand the story is if you

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
look back-- and I keep say
overview, perspective--

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
you will see that the story
from the origin of creation

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to the formation
of Earth and life--

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
animal life, human
life, and now us--

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is a trajectory that's not
just an occasional moment

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
in history, it's the
purpose of the story itself,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is to give individual humans the
ability to see the long story,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
to gain the powers, and to begin
to enter evolution consciously.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So from the perspective
of the trajectory

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and the world view of
conscious evolution,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
we are the first generation in
the history of this Earth given

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:90%
the powers of our ancient gods.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And the whole purpose is
let's use them with love.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
When we discover our
new story of evolution,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
which only was
recently discovered,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
when they discovered
the background radiation

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s, when
they discovered

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
the Big Bang, when
they discovered

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:90%
that the universe is evolving.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
As we said, Einstein thought
it was an eternal universe.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%
This is new.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not in our churches.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not in our schools.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not in our universities.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
The story is not usually told.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But when we hear
it, and when we know

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're part of
the story, then we

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand
that the ideas we hold

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
will affect reality, and these
ideas are called "memes."

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Memes are ideas that, if enough
of us hold them simultaneously,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
they create the reality of
what those memes are saying.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've
had a terrible set

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
of memes in the 20th
into the 21st century.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:90%
We had Nazism.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
That was a meme--

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
a set of ideas
about Jewish people.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the German
people held that meme,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:90%
they could burn Jews alive.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, it would be
almost impossible

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
for the German people
to be able to do that,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
because the meme is gone.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:10%
The meme of communism was
a hugely powerful meme

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:10%
that killed millions of
people on behalf of communism

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:10%
as a meme.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, even though there
still is communism,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
nobody believes that
that behavior pattern

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:90%
was the best they could do.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's no
longer acceptable.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And the same is true of a
mutually assured destruction

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:90%
as a security plan.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:10%
My brother-in-law
Daniel Ellsberg,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:10%
who wrote a story of
the nuclear warriors,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:10%
he said, when you look over
much of our defense plan,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:10%
it ends up with the threat
of nuclear annihilation

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:10%
to protect each other.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's also mad.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:10%
Rwanda was a meme,
where they were

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:10%
able to kill one another
because of the thing

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:10%
of the tribal identity.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:10%
So what we're saying now is
we have a new set of memes.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And our memes can
create reality.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We have scattered memes
now, in our culture.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
We are gaining powers
to heal the earth,

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to free each other--
powers that we

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
used to attribute to our gods.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So how can we get an
understanding, let's say,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of the memetic pattern
of modern culture,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of modern civilization, that we
would feel that we can act on

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:90%
collectively?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Not just occasionally
and individually.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So the best way
to do that is look

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
at the Wheel of Co-Creation.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the sectors, their
functions of any community--

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
from a small community
at a local level,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:90%
or a planetary society.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:90%
We all have health.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:90%
We have education.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:90%
We have governance.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:90%
We have science and technology.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:90%
We have personal growth.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
The Wheel of
Co-Creation is a place

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:90%
of gathering our new memes.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:10%
So when we put the memes
in health, in education,

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:10%
in governance,
where we're showing

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:10%
are moving towards a more
positive future in those memes,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and we connect them--

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:10%
do you remember, like
Ilya Prigogine said,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:10%
if you do a nonlinear
connectivity

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:10%
of individual actions that
work, or innovations that work,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:10%
you get a jump.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So the only way we will really
get a positive jump rather than

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
a negative jump is by connecting
what's already jumping--

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
by connecting what's
already working,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and looking for the synergistic
pattern of the culture

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in which we're living.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And when any of
us see it, then we

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
start to enter into evolution
by choice, not chance,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
because we see the
direction, the trajectory,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and then you put your
own ideas in there.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the next
step for your positive good?

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But you're putting
it in a context

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of the movement towards
the next stage of evolution

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.722 align:middle line:90%
and the powers of gods.

00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
Peter Russell wrote
an interesting book

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:90%
called "A White Hole in Time."

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And in this book,
he has a hypothesis

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that I like very much, and it
could actually be the truth.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It appears that it takes
approximately 10 billion atoms

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
to create a molecule,
and 10 billion molecules

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to create a cell, and 10 billion
cells to create an organism.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, we have about almost
8 billion people on this Earth,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:84%
meaning we're close
to 10 billion people.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So the thought
that Peter has is,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
as we approach 10 billion
humans on planet Earth,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
will we start having
the experience of being

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:90%
members of a new organism?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Will we get the feeling
of wholeness, of oneness,

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and community?

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Will we realize
that each one of us,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
no matter how unique we are, is
actually a member of a living

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:90%
planetary body?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And if that were to happen, we
would move into the new world

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:90%
view naturally.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
We're individuals
with each a choice

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
to what we want to do as part
of a living organism that

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is so much greater than
the sum of our parts.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:10%
And we would be recognizing
that at that growing edge,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:10%
there's health, education, and
economics within this living

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:10%
system that we're part of,
that is literally powers

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.075 align:middle line:10%
we used to attribute to gods.

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And so one reason why this story
is so important for everybody

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to know is that it's
true, [CHUCKLES]

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a perspective
to see it clearly.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And since it's not being taught
or told in our institutions,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:84%
it's up to us to
learn it and to be

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
the leaders at this stage of
our own conscious evolution.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.093 align:middle line:90%
The story makes the difference.

00:10:43.093 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Thinking of planet Earth
as a living organism,

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
as a super organism,
let's just for a moment

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
look at our
communication systems

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
connecting us up on a
planetary scale that never

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:90%
existed before this scale.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's take our defense
systems, whether it

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
be Russia or the United States
or so many other smaller

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
nations now with their nuclear
weapons and their weapons

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:90%
It's integrated.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as winning a war

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
with a nuclear weapon, because
the others have it right away.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So our defense
systems are linked.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't gain power
over the way we used to.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Our production
systems of the way

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
we produce goods and
services is now global.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And anything that you produce
in one part of the world,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
you can receive in
another part of the world.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:90%
The economic systems are global.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So the world view is
helping us to realize

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
we're one living planetary
body, and each of us

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:90%
is a member of that body.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we take our
evolutionary perspective,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
we see the body itself
is gaining powers

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that can take us to the
next stage of our species

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:90%
as a universal humanity.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So the important
thing, particularly

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
for the young
people of the world,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that they are
born at the generation when

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:84%
we either destroy ourselves
or evolve ourselves

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.371 align:middle line:90%
in totally new directions.

00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
What would have to happen
among ourselves for this story

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
to be making sense to people?

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You can hear it, but what
would make it possible

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:90%
for you to feel it?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
I use the word empathy--

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:90%
feeling with one another.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
We know when there's
a crisis and we

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
see somebody had an accident,
we feel immediate empathy.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:90%
But the empathy doesn't last.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We get empathy when we are
excited by like a lunar

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
landing, and we're all together
urging onward that first step

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%
on the moon.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a form of global empathy.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
In the past, however,
empathy does not last.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:90%
You go back to feeling isolated.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It's my intuition that due
to our mass communication

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
system, due to our production
system, due to our defense

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
systems all being interrelated
whether we like it or not,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
there are more and more of
us feeling a global empathy.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And what are we
feeling empathy with?

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Not only each
other individually,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
but let's take that deep
inner impulse of evolution,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:84%
if we call it the
evolution of love,

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:90%
from source through cells--

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
multicells-- animals,
humans-- into our hearts,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
do you feel that the deepest
impulse inside yourself

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:84%
is the evolution of your
love, of your creativity,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:90%
of your desire to be empathetic?

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the evolution of love

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:90%
is evolving us now?

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.880 align:middle line:84%
If it evolves cells and
multicells and animals,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not stopping here.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So here is what might be
considered an outrageously

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
optimistic statement [CHUCKLES],,
given behavior of humans

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth--

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
is that empathy is increasing.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And the evolution of love,
the impulse of evolution

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
itself, is growing in
millions of us subtly.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
More love, more
freedom, more desire

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to be empathetic
with each other.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And I believe one more degree
of that in enough of us

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
will turn the planetary system
on as though it's alive,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and we will do what
Buckminster Fuller says.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We will utilize our
resources, our technology,

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and our know-how to make of this
world a success for everybody

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
without taking it
away from anybody.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The awesome good
news of this story

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
is almost too much for
most of us to believe.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you check
it out, you will

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
see that everything that I'm
saying is actually happening.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So what would stop
it from happening

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
is the illusion of
being separate--

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
of acting on that illusion,
because it's not so.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
(LAUGHING) We're not--
we are individualistic,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
but we're not separate from
a living organism which

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:90%
is part of a larger universe.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So this story holds
within it the seed

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of the future that
will give, really,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
the potential of human
evolution such as no species

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.402 align:middle line:90%
has ever had before.

00:16:13.402 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:10%
A well-known futurist, Ray
Kurzweil, has coined a phrase,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:10%
"The singularity is near."

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:10%
And what he means by that
is that if you accumulate

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:10%
and utilize the full
scale of human capacities,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:10%
we're crossing over in
intelligence and capacities

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:10%
to where we have never
been before as a species.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:10%
And the qualities that are
included in this singularity

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:10%
is our ability with
genetics, which

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:10%
is we can change the gene code
of our own body as we choose.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
That's never existed before.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Another quality is robotics.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
We can create
intelligent machines

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that can do anything
that is robotic.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And in some
respects, that's good

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
because humans should not
have to be doing robotics.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
That means each of
us is going to have

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to do more and more of what
we're uniquely creative at.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to have an economy
that makes that possible.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's good
news, ultimately,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that the robotic behavior
is no longer necessary.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
There's genetics,
there's robotics,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and then there's nanotechnology.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is nanotechnology?

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to
build, atom by atom,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
like nature does, to build
new organisms consciously.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And Eric Drexler
was the young man

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.295 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the
inventors of nanotechnology.

00:17:55.295 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And many years ago one
day, he called me up

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Barbara, I
think we can do resurrections

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:90%
from the dead.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Which of course is a miracle
in the New Testament.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, well,
it's about time Eric.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] He said, what do
you mean it's about time?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, in our
spiritual tradition,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:90%
it is said that it was done.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it true, possibly, that
our spiritual insights

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
are what our technological
capacities are about--

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:90%
able to happen.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, nanotechnology is now
happening all over the world.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So genetics, robotics,
nanotechnology

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
is leading to a singularity of
the increase of intelligence

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
in many, many forums that makes
us radically new as a species.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get
that our crisis is

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the birth of a species
capable of coevolution

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:90%
with nature, spirit, and God--

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
when you get that, you might
have a planetary smile.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And if this meme takes
hold in our consciousness,

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:84%
then we'll move
in this direction,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:90%
because memes create reality.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:84%
If the memes that take hold
of us that we're failing

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're ultimately not
capable of positive action

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
with our new power,
we won't do this.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So what nature, gods has done is
given us this moment of choice.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And the new story is essential
to the planetary choice

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:90%
for a positive future.

Empathy is a field
of consciousness out

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%
of which this story can come.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But then we can
extend our empathy

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:84%
into feeling with beings
or experiences that are not

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of this Earth, that have
not been verified totally

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:90%
by modern science.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:90%
For example, UFOs.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Many people have had the
experience of contact.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Like Nassim Haramein, who is
a very brilliant scientist,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is telling me his
world view that we've

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
been visited by many,
many generations of UFOs

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
that have given us certain
of our capacities of gods.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Now is that true,
or is that not true?

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not verifiable.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, have you
had an experience of dimensions

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:84%
beyond the rational mind
that may or may not be true,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
like UFOs, like altered
states of consciousness,

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
like new beings that have
never been seen before?

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I am certain that there
is more in the universe

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
than we have
already experienced.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
There's more in the universe
than science or our defense

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:84%
department has been
able to affirm.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And so let's stay open
and share with each other.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.175 align:middle line:84%
And the criteria
really is not do

00:21:01.175 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:84%
you have them
uniquely and only you,

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
but do enough others
have these experiences?

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And if so, let's include
it in the possibility

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the new species,
which itself is new,

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.012 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know fully
what we're going to become.

00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Many of our scientists,
like Ervin László and Nassim

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Haramein and Bruce Lipton
and Gregg Braden are speaking

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:84%
of the reality of us coming
from the quantum vacuum.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum vacuum, at
zero-point energy, it is said,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
has approximately
infinite energy.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So what is coming out
into our activities

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:90%
comes from zero-point energy.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we tap directly
into zero-point energy--

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and there are those
who say we can do it

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can make vehicles and
machines that come direct

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:90%
from zero point energy--

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
we entirely would shift the
economic system of the world.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We're still based on
scarcity, our economic system.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:90%
What if that's not so?

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
What if the new species
is going to tap in there

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and give us the power of
nanotechnology, biotechnology,

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
quantum computing, artificial
intelligence, empathy,

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:84%
creativity, contact
with entities or life

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:90%
beyond this planet?

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The vision of
what's now possible

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is actually greater than the
human imagination can fully

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Now what I think is
important that it

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
would be just
difficult to understand

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that we came from no thing at
all for billions of years--

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:84%
from single cell to multicell
to animal to human to us--

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that's awesome.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason, therefore,
to assume that we're not

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.370 align:middle line:84%
going to take the
next step that is

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of evolution,
rather than extinction,

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.305 align:middle line:90%
based on our choice.

00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I think of myself and yourself
and every single one of us

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:90%
as evolution.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I am evolution.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
You are evolution.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Every atom, molecule,
and cell of your being

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
has been and is now being
created by evolution.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
None of them, however,
until this human species

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
has come along, have been
conscious as evolution.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:10%
When I recognize and remember
that I am evolution being

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:10%
conscious of itself and I draw
on the genius of the billions

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:10%
of years of evolution, coded,
actually, in my own body--

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:10%
in the atoms, molecules, cells,
organs, and brain of myself,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:10%
then I get a completely
different internal experience

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:10%
of reality.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And as a woman of 88, I
am evolution evolving.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So I am not only alive this
moment, but I'm emerging.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody
says Barbara, do you

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:84%
feel younger or older, I say
no, I feel newer, as I've said.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Why newer?

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Because I am.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We are emergent, but in the
direction of choice now.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Not just pure evolutionary
direction with so many mass

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:90%
extinctions.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, our
choice, our awareness,

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
our willingness to say
yes to our creativity

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
is giving us the
chance as a species

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
to become conscious
evolutionaries

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and evolve ourselves, our
planet, and life beyond us.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:90%
We feel it spiritually.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We feel it as the impulse of
creativity and divine purpose,

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
however you would like to
call it, inside yourself.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So we feel conscious
evolution spiritually.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Then, we feel it socially.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's through
your vocation.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you called to do?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:90%
What are other people doing?

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%
What is the vocare--

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:84%
the impulse inside
you calling you to?

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're fortunate, you
find the unique expression

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
of your capability
as your vocation.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You find what you are
uniquely called to do.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
That becomes a life
purpose that turns

00:25:54.810 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
on your evolutionary potential
and that fills you with life,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
fills you with the
pleasure, you might say,

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of saying yes to the impulse
of your vocation, no matter how

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.415 align:middle line:90%
challenging.

00:26:10.415 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:10%
So spiritually, you feel
the impulse vocationally,

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:10%
and then we are now
analyzing it scientifically

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:10%
and technologically.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:10%
So this impulse, now, in
our generation of humans,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:10%
is indeed giving us powers
not only of ancient gods,

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:10%
but of new humans who never
existed before on this planet

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:10%
and who are giving us the
opportunity for a future

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.855 align:middle line:10%
of untold possibilities.

00:26:42.855 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:84%
We also have learned
from Bruce Lipton

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that our genes are
blueprints, not our destiny,

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and that our
consciousness creates

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the quality of
expression of the DNA

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
at the center of every cell.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So that means if we have the
consciousness that our story is

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:11.520 align:middle line:84%
the birth of a new species,
and that you and I are called

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
by our own innate capabilities
to participate in that,

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
what happens to your DNA?

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:90%
It says yes.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I feel even with aging--

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
that's a very important issue
for people as they get older--

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
is that your yes to your life
purpose affects your aging.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And the cells are
saying, OK, let's

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
keep her going for a while.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:90%
She thinks there's more to do.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA is capable
of actually being

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:90%
receptive to your intention.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that not
only your stated intention,

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
but the thoughts
that you're holding,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the internal experience
you have of reality,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
the internal thoughts that
you may not even fully express

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, are
affecting your own DNA,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.838 align:middle line:90%
and they affect how you feel.

00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
If you feel troubled,
if you feel concern,

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:84%
if you feel
depressed, often, it's

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:84%
because of this
unconscious thought

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:90%
pattern that's guiding you.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And the thing to do is
notice that thought pattern.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:84%
See if you can bring
it up to consciousness.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in there that
you may not be even aware of?

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And then choose the thought
that you would like to create.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.360 align:middle line:90%
That's an enormous power there.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm choosing the thought
that our story is a birth,

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and therefore that I, as
a member of this planet,

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
am being born, and I'm
88 and I have more to do,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
so I'm thinking my
DNA is saying yes.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Yours will say yes too.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.382 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very important
to think choicefully.

00:29:03.382 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:90%

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:90%
is the evolution of love.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And love is the inner impulse of
creation toward more life, more

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:90%
freedom, more awareness.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
yes to the impulse

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
of that increases the
love in your heart,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
increases your
empathy, increases

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the intimacy of
your relationship,

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
increases contact
with one another.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And evolution is turning
on in you, as you,

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and as far as we know,
there is no known limit

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:90%
to that potentiality.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So when we combine this
empathy with our new capacities

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and our internal yes to
being who we are becoming--

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:90%
you have to say yes.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:90%
You have to want it.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to choose it.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
God put freedom in the system.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to just sit
back and say change me, God.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:84%
You're going to say
yes to the impulse,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and when you do that
impulse turns on.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And when it turns on
and you connect up

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:84%
with others turning
on and you're

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
looking at that entire health,
education, economic, science

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and technology--

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
all the innovations reality
now has to offer you,

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:84%
become a new being
in consciousness.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
You become aware that you are
evolution consciously choosing

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to evolve.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.510 align:middle line:84%
You tap into the source
of creation itself.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
You gain a certain joy
of being that is not

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:84%
about a particular
event, but it's

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
a joy of your awareness
of the nature of reality.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
With all the pain and all
the amount of annihilation

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that has gone on for
billions of years,

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:90%
the directionality is in you.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And because we're entering the
age of conscious evolution,

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:84%
this choice brings
evolution itself into focus

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.544 align:middle line:90%
through humans and through you.

00:31:31.544 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%

When we realize that we
individually, as well

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
as collectively, have
powers of ancient gods

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and that we are those
gods come alive right now,

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
then the experience
that we can have of life

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%
is transformed from the
challenges and the difficulties

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and the uncertainties
to a form of optimism,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.190 align:middle line:84%
a form of creativity,
and of thankfulness

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
to be alive at this
greatest moment of choice

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:90%
of your entire human family.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And by your yes, you're
tipping the scales forever.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And if the inner god shows
up as you creating, loving,

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and emerging, you will find
that we actually collectively

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:84%
have far more than the
powers of ancient gods.
