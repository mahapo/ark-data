00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.826 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "The New Politics,
Synergistic Democracy."

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Two, one, zero,
all engines running.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.754 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:40.234 align:middle line:10%
Lift off, we have a lift off.

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:48.362 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Clear.

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:51.146 align:middle line:90%
The eagle has landed.

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Rocket tranquility, we copy
you on the ground to fight.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
You've got a bunch of
guys about to turn blue.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.044 align:middle line:90%
We're freezing again.

00:00:57.044 --> 00:00:59.798 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:03.742 align:middle line:84%
Clear, Neil we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm at the foot
of the ladder.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
That's one small step for man
one giant leap for mankind.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I was so thrilled when
I saw that lunar landing,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:10%
and my understanding was
actually we're coming to become

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:10%
a new world species.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:10%
We're building new
worlds on this Earth,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:10%
and we will be building
new worlds in space.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
We're being born as
a universal species.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely thrilled,
and what I did at that time,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
as I had been a promoter
of the space program,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
is I called on my friends who
were physicists and scientists,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
many of them in the
military-industrial complex.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I asked us together to
develop a new, long-range goal

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
We called it building new worlds
on Earth, new worlds in space,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
new worlds in the human mind.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So I had drawn the
military-industrial complex

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
into a long-range positive
goal for humanity,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and my partner
John Whiteside was

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the Chief Officer of Information
for the Air Force in New York.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
He had done live coverage
of the space program itself,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and one day, he took me to meet
the US sergeants of the United

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:90%
That was like 1,000 sergeants.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So I made a speech
to the sergeants,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and I said, what would you
do if your president asked

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
you to build new
worlds on this Earth

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and help build new
worlds in space?

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:90%
What would you think of this?

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
The sergeants of America
stood up and cheered,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that this
goal would be very popular

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
within the military, within the
sergeants, and all the people

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
who were evolutionaries.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:10%
So it was an amazing goal
that I had discovered.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Out of this, we literally
created a new global proposal

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
which we called Building
new worlds on Earth,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
new worlds in space, new
worlds in the human mind.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So John Whiteside and I decided
to call on Congressman Olin

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Teague.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Tiger Teague he
was called, and he

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
was Chief of the Science
and Technology Committee

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
of the US Congress.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So Tiger Teague loved
the space program,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and he was enthusiastically
listening to us when I told him

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
about the new global goal.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why don't we
call the members of Congress

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
committees together
to look at this.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you think Congress would
approve of this for the United

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
States and for the
world and offer it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:10%
And Tiger Teague
said, Barbara, we

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:10%
can't call the
committees of Congress

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:10%
together to look at anything.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, then how do you
get anything done, Tiger?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:90%
He said, we don't.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:90%
You do it, Barbara.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:84%
I was wanting the US Congress
to set a new national goal

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
for the world and offer it
as an international goal,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and he said, you do it.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So John Whiteside, my Chief
Officer of Information,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and myself went to have lunch,
and we pondered what to do.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And John, who had been doing
the live coverage of the space

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:90%
program was very talented.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:10%
He said, let's put
everybody into a wheel.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:10%
He said, you can't
change the world

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:10%
with speakers talking to
people sitting in rows.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
People sitting in
rows can't do it,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
but if we put people who
are in science, in health,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in education, who disagree
with each other in the wheel

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to look for common
goals and to match

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
their own needs with
other people's resources,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe Tiger Teague was
right, we should do it.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:10%
So John happened to have a son
who was at Southern Illinois

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:10%
University which was sort of
out of the range of most people

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:10%
that I knew.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:10%
And it happened that
Buckminster Fuller

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:10%
was a scholar in
residence there,

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:10%
and John's son went to SIU.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to do a conference
at Southern Illinois University

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
in the wheel, and we
called the wheel SYNCON

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:90%
for Synergistic Convergence.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to do a
conference in a wheel,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:10%
you can call it SYNCON.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was the
students built the most

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:90%
gorgeous looking wheel.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
They built it by hand
with removable walls

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
between sectors of health,
education, economics.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
circle in the middle,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and they had a staircase,
where you could go up

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and you looked at
the social body

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
as a living organism which
is actually the truth of it.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:10%
And so the way we
did the conference

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:10%
is we invited people
from all over the world

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:10%
to come and sit in different
sectors of the wheel.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just students, but
we had students there as well,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and it was the time of
the student protests.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a lot of
protesting students,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and we had black power
leaders, and we had

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
the ambassador from Bangladesh.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:10%
And quite a few amazing people,
including ambassador Lazar

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:10%
Mojsov who at that time was
Director of the Security

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:10%
Council of the United Nations.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So the SYNCON wheel was
actually a wheel-like structure

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
based on this wheel, and you
see the different sectors

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that were removable walls
between all the sectors.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And that at the center, which
we call here the Planetary

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:84%
DNA, what we had
there was a ladder,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and people could go and look
at the system as a whole.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was a very
important time in history,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:90%
in the early '70s.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:10%
There were student
protests everywhere.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Deans of colleges
were being locked up.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It was somewhat nerve-racking
to go into a college

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
with all these
students, because they

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:90%
were angry at the government.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
They were angry
at the leadership,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
because John Whiteside's
son went to SIU, we got in.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know if we were
going to be attacked,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
but what actually
happened is we invited

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:90%
the students into the wheel.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And we had students
in every sector

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
of the wheel along
with well-known people

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:90%
from all around the world.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And every sector of
the wheel is to state

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
what do you want
to create, what do

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:84%
you need to create it in health,
in education, in economics,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and what do you want
to share freely?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So instead of win-lose voting
in the sectors of the wheel,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:90%
it's what do you want to create?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you ask people that,
almost everybody gets excited.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
antagonistic to each other,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
because the fact is
you can't create it

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
unless somebody else wants
to co-create it with you.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
And by asking the
right question-- what

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
do you want to create, what
do you need to create it,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and what do you want to
share freely, just give away?

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:90%
People wanted to dance.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to do singing.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to do special
things as a giveaway.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:90%
The students were thrilled.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:10%
We had every sector of the
wheel meeting in small groups,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:10%
then they come into the main
part of the auditorium there,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:10%
and they look for common goals
and match needs with resources.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And we call this
vocational connecting

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
or, in my old language,
suprasexual co-creation.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Because what was happening if
you want to create something,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and somebody has
something that you need--

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're the director
of the US Chamber of Commerce

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and a long-haired hippy
comes up to you and says,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I have something to offer
you to fulfill your need

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:90%
for the economic system.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And you see the two of
them-- the long-haired hippy

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and the Director
of the US Chamber--

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%
talking.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So what John Whiteside
did is he went up,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and he took pictures of people
sharing, vocational sharing.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And then every evening, he did
the "New Worlds Evening News,"

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and he put all these
antagonistic people

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:90%
sharing in the news themselves.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you see yourself
as part of the evening news,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
psychologically people
realized they are the news.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The structure of the wheel
and the questions you ask

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:90%
does not eliminate competition.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It changes the game to
help me create something.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
win-lose voting, and this

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is what I want to
create, and this

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
is what I need to create it
changes the internal reactions

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:10%
Because nobody can
create alone, and this

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:10%
would be true of all
the protesters as well.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:10%
So instead of being
geared up to protest,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:10%
they're geared up to say, what
do I actually want to create?

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to be against
something than to be for it,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and we changed the political
game from what am I against,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and how can I win, to
what do I need to create,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and who can join me
to help me create it?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:10%
And the difference of those
two questions, win or lose,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:10%
or what do I want to create,
and what do I want to give,

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:10%
changed the political game.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:84%
We are reducing the
win-lose scenario

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:84%
to a new scenario
which is joining

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
to create what you want to
have happen, because you can't

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:90%
create it alone.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So the most unlikely
people would

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:84%
start to join each other
to create something.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Ambassador Mojsov spoke
from there of his vision

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:84%
of international cooperation,
which he had told us you cannot

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
possibly get in the
structure of the current UN.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:10%
They're structure in
competitive nation states.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
If you could bring SYNCONs
to the United Nations

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and have people join in wheels
of what they want to create

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and what they need
to create it, you

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:90%
could change the United Nations.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I want you to do that, said he.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We tried, actually, but
we didn't manage to do it.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, at Southern
Illinois University,

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
we then would bring
everybody back

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
into their sectors of the wheel,
and we asked the question,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
is there anything
missing for anyone

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
that you still need to
create and have had nobody

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:90%
respond to you?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we have 100
people in the wheel,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of people
who had been interacting

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:90%
There was silence.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And I'll never forget
this one young man who

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:10%
was trying to get
marijuana legalized,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and he was being rejected from
various sectors of the wheel

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:10%
during the meeting.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:10%
He came in, and he
knelt down at the center

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:10%
of this circle of people.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And my partner John
Whiteside and I

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.514 align:middle line:84%
looked at each
other and thought,

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
now, he could ruin everything,
and here's what he did.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:84%
He actually knelt down
like this, and he said,

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be all right.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:90%
This is what we really meant.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be
promoting marijuana anymore.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
high that people

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
get on when they
cooperate with each other,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling of pleasure
that this young man who

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:84%
was getting the feeling of
pleasure from marijuana,

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:90%
this is a better way to do it.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So Edgar Mitchell
happened to be there.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, Barbara, if
we had had a spiritual Geiger

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
counter, where we could measure
spirituality at this SYNCON,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
it would have gone off the
charts, because synergy

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:90%
creates spirituality.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't have to mention
let's become spiritual.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
We had to say, what
do you want to create,

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
what you need to create it,
what do you want to give?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So we organized the next
level of synergistic politics

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:90%
by doing this.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, during all
this, Buckminster Fuller

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
who was a Scholar in Residence
at Southern Illinois University

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
sent his Director of
Communications Tom Turner

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:90%
to address the whole group.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Turner said, Dr. Fuller
has something to propose.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
He feels that women should
run for political office,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and he proposes that Barbara
Marx Hubbard run for president

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:90%
The students cheered.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:10%
It was a total
off-the-charts statement.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:10%
All of this happened in the
1970s, and we continued.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:90%
We did 25 SYNCONs.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
From that first
SYNCON, we did SYNCONs

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with gang leaders
of Los Angeles.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We did SYNCONs with
the space scientists

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:90%
in Huntsville, Alabama.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
We did SYNCONs with the General
Federation of Women's Club.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
We did SYNCONs, and
we practiced what

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:84%
I would call synergistic
democracy all over the country.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But I wore out, and so I
couldn't afford to do it.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
John finally, unfortunately,
got cancer and died,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was left there
with this knowledge

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
about synergistic
democracy and not

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:90%
knowing what to do about it.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't really a
political candidate.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I knew that wasn't my
role to run for politics

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:90%
in the ordinary way.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So what happened, in 1984,
was the Year of the Woman,

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:90%
if you remember in politics.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And somebody came to me,
Ward Phillips from Seattle--

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:90%
I remember it clearly--

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Barbara,
why don't you

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
run for vice president of
the United States in 1984?

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the Year of the Woman,
just declare it and run.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So I had to announce,
and I had to sign up,

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.687 align:middle line:84%
I'm running for vice president
of the United States.

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I signed up with the
Democratic Party.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
They paid no attention to me.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:90%
The media ignored me completely.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I had nothing to say
that I was against,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and my platform was new worlds
on earth, new worlds in space,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:90%
new worlds in the human mind.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I decided to do it myself.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:10%
My partner Carolyn
Anderson with groups

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:10%
of people from
northern California

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:10%
decided to be a
committee for me.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote to all my different
friends around the country,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:10%
and I said, I'm running
for vice president.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:10%
Would you give a party for me?

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.409 align:middle line:84%
Well, they thought it was
funny, but it was interesting.

00:17:02.409 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Barbara's running
for vice president.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:90%
We'll give a party for her.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was I went to
wherever what party was being

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
prepared for me, and
I said, my proposal

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:84%
is that in the Office
of the Vice President

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:90%
a new function is established.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
We called it an
Office for the Future

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
to scan for, map,
connect, and communicate

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.374 align:middle line:90%
what's working in the world.

00:17:29.374 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
the vice president's,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:84%
said I in all these
small groups I went to,

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is to tell the world
every week what's working.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:90%
We only hear what isn't working.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The president has to
deal with every crisis,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and the news only tells
us what's breaking down.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
The people don't know
what's working, say I.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's absolutely true.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
every single center

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I went to wanted to create
their own Office for the Future.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was nice
that Barbara wanted

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to run for vice president,
but how about me in Seattle?

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
How about me in Chicago?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So these little Positive Future
Centers, they were called,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
they cropped up all
over the country,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and there were 90 Positive
Future Centers by the time

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
it was time for me to go to
San Francisco to be nominated.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had not been
covered by the media.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I had not been noticed
by the Democratic Party.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And a friend said to
me, now, Barbara, you've

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
done a nice job, but
you'll be ridiculed

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
if you go to San
Francisco and try

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to get into the Democratic
National Convention

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and propose this to somebody.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
There's no chance in the
world for you to do that,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and you've already
done a good job.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't go.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
those times in life

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to check in
with your inner voice,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and the inner voice said,
Barbara, go to San Francisco.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So with a small team
I go to San Francisco,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have a
pass to the floor.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that the wife
of the governor of Colorado

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
knew me, and she
said, let Barbara in.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I was let in with maybe
eight or nine friends who

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
had been in these
Positive Future Centers

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
into the Democratic National
Convention knowing nobody.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
The thing is, you have to
get 200 delegates to sign

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:10%
a petition to place your name
in nomination for vice president

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.372 align:middle line:10%
in order to be
proposed publicly.

00:19:42.372 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And of course, a lot of
people wanted to do it,

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:10%
because you get a
national speech.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:10%
People like Jesse Jackson
and others were trying.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I did.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
First morning, 5:30
AM, South Dakota,

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I go to the South Dakota caucus.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There may be a few
stragglers at 5:30,

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say my name is
Barbara Marx Hubbard,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and I request that
you nominate me

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
for vice president
of the United States.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I will do is I will
be able to make a speech

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to say that the Democratic
Party is interested in finding

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
out and communicating
what's working

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:84%
in the world for
the vice presidents.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you let me make that
speech, if you nominate me,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll turn my votes over
to Geraldine Ferraro.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:10%
Because she's a real
politician, and I'm not,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:10%
but I want to make
that speech for you,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:10%
for the Democratic Party.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
They signed up, and
by the second day,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
myself and my small team
had over 200 delegates

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
nominating me, proposing me
for the nomination for vice

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:90%
president.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Democratic Party had to
announce two women's names are

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
placed in nomination, Geraldine
Ferraro and Barbara Marx

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Hubbard.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:84%
We must attract friend and
foe alike to a new challenge,

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the building a new
worlds on this earth

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and new worlds in space.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Though this is
still an allusive goal

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:84%
in the government, it has
remained the driving force

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:90%
behind Barbara's efforts.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was my mindset that
gave me the courage to do what

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:90%
was considered to be--

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
including by myself-- an
almost impossible task?

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:84%
When you say yes to an impulse
that is of divine import--

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:90%
and you're not being selfish--

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
when you say yes,
you are empowered

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.997 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill your mission.

00:21:53.997 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot
that goes in there.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
really good idea.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to say yes not
for your own self-interest

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
but because you know it's
something needed for world.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
When it was announced
at the convention

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that two women's names would
be placed in nomination,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I have to admit, I was stunned.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to
think of a higher power

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and that it's going to happen,
but for it to actually happen

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:90%
was stunning to me.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was shocked, and
I didn't have my speech,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
because nobody thought I would
actually be making the speech.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was
determined to do it,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:84%
you see, there was a kind of
mixed message inside myself.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So as it was announced that
I was now to make my speech--

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
important, because I

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
was imagining this in all these
yoga centers and small churches

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:90%
around the country.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And there I was walking
up this stairway,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.895 align:middle line:84%
and there was Senator Kennedy
and these various senators

00:22:58.895 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking,
who is that?

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen to us?

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
An unknown person
does not do this.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just telling this to be
a magical reality for anybody

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:90%
with an internal yes.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
When you say yes to the
evolutionary impulse

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
within you, you are saying
yes to the impulse of creation

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
itself which is in
every one of us.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And your yes, when
said with certainty

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:37.735 align:middle line:84%
and no fear of failure,
activates evolution itself.

00:23:37.735 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see now in
looking at what I did.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.135 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see
that happen now.

00:23:49.135 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The reason I think
this can happen now

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
is because democracy
really is failing.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Win-lose democracy is a
structure that actually cannot

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:90%
create cooperation.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It's designed for win-lose,
and it was a great advance

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:90%
over dictatorship or monarchy.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But if our job now is to
create global co-creativity

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and connect people worldwide,
we need to evolve democracy,

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and I believe
synergistic democracy.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Using a wheel-shaped environment
to bring separate parts

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:84%
together is the right
structure for democracy.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's obvious, although
it was a great advance over

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
dictatorship or monarchy, it
cannot by structure create

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:90%
a global world.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So I am saying, the evolution
of the structure of democracy

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
needs to happen, and
the way it can happen

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:90%
is we can do it first ourselves.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:90%
We can do it on internet.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:90%
We can do it on Gaia TV.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
We can do it wherever we
are given the opportunity

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
to connect separate parts
on internet and on media.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can become the news
without being nominated

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.260 align:middle line:84%
for vice president,
and I believe

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.850 align:middle line:84%
the new news will eventually
affect the actual news

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
and effect democracy.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller said,
play a better game ourselves.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I think will
happen when we demonstrate it

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
on internet, which
we're doing here

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:90%
right on Gaia TV as an example.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
That the political
parties will begin

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to say, how could
we connect what's

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
creative within our structure,
and they could overcome

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:90%
their win-lose structure.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not made to be that way.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:84%
They could still have different
political parties that

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:90%
were trying to join Genius.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So I would call upon
existing political leaders

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:90%
to be able to take that step.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
But the first step
would be all of us

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
who want to do it, let's do
it on media and internet,

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and let's learn the process
of synergizing what works.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember Ilya
Prigogine who came up

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
with dissipative structure
for Nobel Prize winning,

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
he said that when a
system is dysfunctional,

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:90%
innovations occur everywhere.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, there
is a non-linear exponential

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
interaction of innovations,
and what happens

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is the system flips
and cooperates

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:90%
in its own self-transcendence.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I was originally inspired by
Teilhard de Chardin now so

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:90%
many years ago.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
the noosphere--

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
which is the thinking
layer, now the internet--

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:90%
gets its collective eyes--

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that is, we turn each
other on on internet,

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:90%
just like I'm suggesting--

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
he felt it would
lead, in his language,

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to the Christification
of the Earth.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We could say that in
more secular terms,

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
aiming at a planetary
awakening in love

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
through a unique self-symphony,
which is everybody's voice

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:90%
heard joined Genius.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we're right at
the threshold of doing it.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:84%
While we bring in all
these different people who
