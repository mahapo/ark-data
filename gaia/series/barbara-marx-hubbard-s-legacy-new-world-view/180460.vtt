00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "A New World View."

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.839 align:middle line:84%
What is the meaning of our
new powers that is good?

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I had a very happy
childhood in New York City.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I walked to school every day.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I had lots of
interesting things.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed my life.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 15, into
this enjoyable life

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:84%
story that I was leading,
the United States

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
dropped the first
atomic bomb on Japan.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was with my
family, who happened

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to know the generals of
the Second World War.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And there was enthusiasm
for this horror.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was great.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:90%
We won the war.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:10%
And I'm this 15-year-old girl.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:10%
And as I began to absorb the
reality of the power that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:10%
came from Einstein
having figured

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:10%
out that E equals mc squared--

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:10%
scientific knowledge
made the bomb--

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly, I could see
it's not just the bomb.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It could be many other uses
of power and misuses of power.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I could see
the atomic bomb was not

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:84%
the end of the
use of this power.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It was the beginning.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:10%
So I asked, what is the
meaning of this level

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:10%
of destructive power that
comes from understanding

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:10%
how nature works?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So the first place I went
to find out was the church.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in Scarsdale,
New York at the time.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I, believe it or not,
joined the Episcopal church.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I brought all my sisters
and brothers with me.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had an interview
with the priest.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have
a question for you.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.244 align:middle line:10%
Did Jesus really do all this?

00:02:28.244 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think is the
meaning of this kind of power

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:90%
in the atomic bomb that's good?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.994 align:middle line:90%
And I could see he had no idea.

00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
think you should go

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:90%
to Sunday school, young lady.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Sunday school
at the Episcopal church.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And there, I found
the problem was Eve.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:90%
So that didn't work.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
continue in that way.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to Bryn Mawr
College, a good women's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:90%
college.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to take a course
on the meaning and direction

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:90%
of human evolution.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:90%
There was no course on it.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:90%
You could take history.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
You could take science.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:90%
You could take technology.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But you couldn't take
direction, nor could you

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
take what you were supposed to
be doing about this direction.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:90%
So I read in my room.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the
opportunity to meet

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:90%
with President Eisenhower.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It was 1953.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:90%
He had just become president.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:90%
He was a friend of my father's.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I was taken into the
Oval Office to meet him.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- it was
a courtesy call.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, pleasantly,
hello, young lady.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Mr. President,
I have a question for you.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, young lady?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, what do
you think is the meaning

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
of our military, scientific,
technological, and industrial

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.286 align:middle line:90%
new power that's good?

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And he looked startled.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:90%
He shook his head.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I have no idea.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:10%
It was the most powerful
man in the world

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:10%
at that time-- no idea.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So the thought occurred to me,
well, then we better find out.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to take my
junior year abroad in Paris.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was in 1948.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:10%
And Paris, this beautiful
city, was deeply depressed.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:10%
The most sophisticated
nations in the world

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:10%
had bombed millions.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Existentialism was
the world view.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to be an
existentialist in Paris

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.808 align:middle line:84%
in 1948, going to the Sorbonne
and the L'Ecole des Sciences

00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:50.032 align:middle line:90%
Politiques.

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, existentialists
literally say

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
there is no intrinsic meaning
to the world except what

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
you personally can give it.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine
walking around in Paris,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
in the depressed society, in the
L'Ecole des Sciences Sciences,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
which was a political
science school,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
with all these children of
diplomats of the Second World

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:90%
War?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I still had this
feeling of hope inside me.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So I was asking,
when people said,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:90%
what are you hopeful about--

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:90%
it was very critical.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It appeared to them I
was a stupid American

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and that I had no idea how
terrible the suffering had

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
been.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I did.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But I was still looking
for meaning of power.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I was
having lunch alone.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to walk into
a little restaurant called

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Chez Rosalie on the
Left Bank of Paris.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And there were just two
tables in this restaurant.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:90%
It was November.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:10%
There was a wood fire.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
It was burning.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And I sat down.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was attempting to
be the existentialist.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:90%
So I had my Gauloises cigarette.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I ordered half a bottle of wine.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:10%
And in walked a very
handsome American.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:10%
And he had to sit
exactly opposite me

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:10%
because there was
no other place.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:10%
So he did.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I boldly said,
would you like

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:90%
to have a little bit of my wine?

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, I have a
question I'd like to ask you.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:90%
His name was Earl Hubbard.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you think is
the meaning of our new power

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that's good?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:10%
And Earl said, I'm an artist.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:10%
And I'm seeking a new image of
man commensurate with our power

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:10%
to shape the future.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And he described to me how
we had lost a self-image.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:10%
And he was describing the
beautiful sculpture of David

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:10%
that was a whole
beautiful being.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:10%
And then he talked about
after the sculpture of David,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:18.366 align:middle line:10%
came Monet, Manet, Pizarro,
Picasso, Jackson Pollock.

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:10%
And as you see those
paintings, there's

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:10%
a gradual breakup
of the image of man.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:10%
And the most modern of
the paintings at that time

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:10%
was actually empty.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:90%
"White on White," it was called.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So he said, as an artist,
we need a new image

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
because if a culture does not
have its own story and an image

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:84%
of where it's going,
it cannot be great.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'm
going to marry you.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Basically, I loved Earl.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want
to get married.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to discover the
meaning of our power.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I had a powerful mission.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't what happened.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I got married at Saint
Thomas Church in New York.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking down the
aisle toward the priest.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking, I'm
going into a head-on clash

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
because I was coming
from some other space.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was living into
this new culture.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So Earl wanted to live far
away from New York City

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:84%
so he could be an
artist and be original.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And we went to Lime
Rock, Connecticut.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:90%
We had a little house there.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:90%
And I was pregnant.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:90%
And I was having this baby.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember waking
up one morning.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, where
did Barbara Marx go?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
this woman who was

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
seeking after something new?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was very difficult
for me for some time.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So after I got married,
I suddenly was no longer

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Marx, the seeker.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I was a wife.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
becoming a mother.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had my first child and
then my second child and then

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
my third child and
my fourth child.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the time of my fourth
child, I loved my babies.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:90%
I worked with them all the time.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
nagging question.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:84%
What is the meaning,
not only now of my power

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
or the power or human
power, but my children?

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Where are we going in
the future that's good?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
my deep questioning

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:90%
that I discovered as I--

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Teilhard de Chardin.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered the
process of evolution.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:90%
He discovered the new story.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And it is basically a cell,
multicell, animal, human,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and humans going around the
next turn in the spiral.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of evolution that
leads to higher consciousness,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
greater freedom of
individuals, and more

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
conscious connectivity,
complexity, or love.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I saw
the story is good.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Billions of species
have been extinct.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
We could destroy
the entire planet.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a possibility
for it to go somewhere more.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when
Buckminster Fuller said,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
we have the
resources, technology,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and know-how to
make of this world

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
a 100% physical
success if we synergize

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
our resources and
our innovations,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that hope was welling
up in me again

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that we had the power to
make something great happen.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So while I was going
to the Church Women

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
United and the General
Federations of Women's Clubs

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and taking the
children to school,

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
this bursting yearning for
the story was growing in me.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'd already heard
it from Teilhard

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and from Buckminster Fuller.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But how are we going
to be part of it?

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I was
vacuuming in Lakeville.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
We moved to Lakeville,
Connecticut.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And I was watching TV.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.425 align:middle line:84%
And I saw John Glenn
go up into space.

00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.214 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:32.014 align:middle line:90%
>> --correct.

00:11:32.014 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:90%
The ready light is on.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Eject mercury umbilical.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Godspeed, John Glenn.

00:11:37.506 --> 00:11:43.362 align:middle line:10%
>> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

00:11:43.362 --> 00:11:46.778 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:46.778 --> 00:11:49.218 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:10%
>> --loud and clear.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:10%
Roger, we're
programming in roll OK.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bumpy
along about here.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And I had this excitement.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The tears were
running down my face.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
myself, we're being

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:90%
born as a universal species.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Our crisis is the birth of
a new human, of a new world,

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of a new phase of
evolutionary history.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And with that awareness, I
began to see the direction

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:90%
of the story in our lifetime.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I could see that the meaning
of the new power that

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
could lead to destruction
is also the power that

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:90%
could lead to evolution.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that it
would lead to evolution

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
is if we become conscious of
it and become guides of it.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So then I could see
that the role of humans

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
is changing from mere
survival or power

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
over each other or over nature,
that the real meaning of humans

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to guide the
new powers of humanity--

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
science, technology, industry--
toward a new humanity

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to heal the earth, to free the
people, to explore inner space

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and outer space and a cosmos
probably filled with life.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And I got turned on to the
next stage of evolution

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.139 align:middle line:90%
at that time in my life.

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was never the same again.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I realized
that we did not

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
have leaders who could take
us the next step, who did not

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we had Teilhard de
Chardin and Sri Aurobindo

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and Buckminster Fuller
and, to some degree,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
other evolutionary thinkers.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't see
anybody who was saying,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
let's use this power to heal
the earth, free the people.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
a universal species.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's the greatest
age of human history.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't find anybody like that.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But until I saw John
Glenn go into space,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware that we,
ourselves, were taking

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
another jump and
that we were going

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to be a universal
humanity and that I

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
happened to be born
at the time of one

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:90%
of those turns in the spiral.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't going to be
more and more power and wealth

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:90%
on this Earth alone.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We were going to use the
technology to heal the earth,

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
free the people, and
explore the universe.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So I became a
pioneer in awareness.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.607 align:middle line:84%
So this wife and mother of four
and then five children that I

00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
was, I shifted in the
entire phase of my life

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
in my mid-thirties to be someone
who has a direction to go

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:90%
forward for evolution--

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and that I was there for--
to share with my children

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that they are the generation
born when humanity

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:84%
can heal the earth,
free the people,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:90%
and explore the universe.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that five out
of five children got turned on.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So once the children knew
this and I, as the mother,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
knew this, the real problem
was what could I do about this.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw John
Glenn go into space,

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I began to think we need
to meet the space leaders.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And we need to see
what they think

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
is the next step
for the future good.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:10%
So then I, actually,
with John Whiteside,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:10%
who was in the
Air Force, decided

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:10%
to move to Washington, DC, to
make a total jump in my life.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I moved to Washington.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And my purpose there
was to find out

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
what's working in the world,
not just in the space program.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's when I began to
say, what's working in health?

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:90%
What's working in technologies?

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
What's working in politics?

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
What's working in
ways of healing?

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.515 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at the
growing edge of what's working,

00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:84%
you find enormous numbers
of things are now working.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
considered the news.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
The news is what's not working.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So I became ever more
aware of putting together

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
the story of a world
that is possibly

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:90%
what Buckminster Fuller said--

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have the resources,
technology, and know-how

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:90%
to make it work.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have the story
to inform our leaders, even.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Our political leaders,
our social leaders,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:84%
our university leaders, our
church leaders didn't know.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
interesting in life when

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:84%
you get to know something that--
obvious that others don't know.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Evolution is operating now
by choice, not by chance

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
or by the inevitability
of the nature of nature.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
So while nature
has been evolving

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:84%
for these billions of years,
the species involved in nature

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:90%
had no idea.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:10%
Early humans and humans
in even later history

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:10%
could see the spiritual
potential of humanity,

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:10%
could see the potential of
humanity in life after death,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:10%
could see that we've had
awesome great beings,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:10%
the avatars of our species.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't see
that we ourselves

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
were going to gain
the powers of gods

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and that we had to learn to be
good gods because we were just

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of our
phase of universal life.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I saw that the species
that is capable of using

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the new power for
the good combined

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
with our deep inner
spiritual awakening

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:90%
was going to be radically new.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So I began to piece together a
picture of the new human that

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:90%
could possibly be doing this.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And I saw what I call the new
species had these qualities.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The first quality is an
evolutionary spirituality--

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
is that the new human
recognizes that we

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
are one with the
impulse of evolution,

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:84%
that that core of
the spiral that

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:84%
has gone to it for billions
of years is going through us.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I became, in my
spirituality, one

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
with the impulse, one
with that God force.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
The next level of myself
or anyone as a new species

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:90%
is expanded vocation.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Your calling is not just to
be doing immediate things

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:90%
on this Earth.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Your calling is to actualize
that evolutionary potential

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:90%
inside yourself.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And you take the lid
off the top of it.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And you say to
yourself, if I could

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
go the whole way with my
vocation, what would it be?

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
it became for me?

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
My vocation would go to
a planetary awakening

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
where enough people on Earth
would come together and see

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:84%
that not only can
we heal the earth

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and free ourselves from
immediate deficiencies,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
but we're born in the
universe filled with life.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So I became vocationally
aroused to go

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
tell the story to turn humanity
on, in some way, with that.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:90%
So that was vocation.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started to study
innovations in every field,

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in that
wheel of co-creation--

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
innovations in health,
education, technology,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
governance, healing--

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I saw we're already capable
of being the new species.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And this was like a secret
that was obvious on one hand.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And people could realize
we had all these powers.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:84%
But nobody put it together
as our story of evolution

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that would be leading
to radical newness

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and that we could plug in
things like our space program

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
into an evolutionary
story, more than just

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.357 align:middle line:90%
a technological achievement.

00:20:44.357 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual awareness
that I received

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
from knowing the new story and
knowing the billions of years

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:84%
of evolution and feeling that
impulse of creation going

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
to higher order and more love--

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt that impulse
inside me as spirit.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I felt my yearning to
participate, to share,

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to create--

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
was spirit in me,
as me, creating.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So what comes of this is
an intimacy with spirit

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
as you become intimate
with the power

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:90%
to actually change the world.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The only way you
could possibly do it

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is not by power over, but
power with the direction

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that spirit is already
taking, not just humanity,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:90%
but evolution itself.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And let's add to this we're
one tiny planet in the universe

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:90%
of billions of galaxies.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
experiencing here on Earth

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is undoubtedly the beginning of
our life as a cosmic species.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And undoubtedly, we are
going to learn so much

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
more that the radical
truth is that this

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is the intention
of spirit itself--

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is to create spiritually
motivated co-creators

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:90%
at a universal scale.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite futurists
and authors is Jerry Glenn.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And in a book he wrote
on conscious technology,

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
he identified a pathway forward.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said if the mystic,
spiritually motivated person

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:84%
joins forces with
the technocrat who

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
understands the enormity of
the powers given to humanity,

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that combination of the mystical
and the technical capabilities

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
will lead to a new civilization.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And he called it a conscious,
technocratical civilization.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm calling it, even
deeper, a new species

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
because if you actually apply
these new powers in health,

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
education, economics,
and technology

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.656 align:middle line:84%
itself like artificial
intelligence and nanotechnology

00:23:08.656 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:90%
and robotics--

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
if we apply all
of that with love

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
of evolution, which

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is higher consciousness,
more freedom,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
through more complex and
loving order, we might become--

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Teilhard de Chardin
called us an ultra-human.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Aurobindo and The Mother
called us gnostic humans.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
These are humans beyond the
physical animal human who dies.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't think we
would have to die.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller called
us continuous humans.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The people at
Singularity University

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that are accruing so much
of this high technology

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
for positive use
say life extension

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:90%
is going to be radical.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:90%
If you can live--

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm 88.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So let's say I could live to 95.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get
to 95, they're going

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to have discovered another five
or 10 years of how to live,

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So it might be that we'll
have to choose when to die.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:84%
We are already
choose to give birth.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:90%
So evolution is creating choice.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's creating
co-creators, or it's

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:84%
going to destroy
the entire world.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Our crisis is either the birth
of our civilization to the new

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
or the deaths and destruction
through the misuse of power.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Evolution is not
haphazard in the sense

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
it feels, to me, from looking at
the spiral and the direction--

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it's testing
things out all the time--

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:90%
what works, what doesn't work.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
What doesn't work eventually
is excluded from evolution.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
What does work, if it
leads to consciousness,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
freedom, and more
love, is increased.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very profound
directionality in the choices.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We're free to choose
one ways or the other.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But we're not free to survive
if we make the wrong choices.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And nature is very
happy to extinct

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
any species that makes
choices that does not

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:90%
lead to its sustainability.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And now talking on
the human level,

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
the particular period
of history we're in

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is where choice has
become the greatest thing

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever, ever faced.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
use all our powers--

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:90%
that is good?

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm doing this.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
The new world view is an
evolutionary world view

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that sees humanity as an
expression of the impulse

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
of evolution itself, seeking
more consciousness, more

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:90%
freedom, and more love.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:10%
How can we reach the
masses with this news

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:10%
of what we can become?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very good
question because the answer is

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:90%
to tell ourselves the new news.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
What we see every day on the
news is what doesn't work.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And the actual concept of
news is something not working.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And the worse it is,
the more news it is.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
How often do you
hear the growing edge

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:90%
of everything as the news?

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Almost never.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So here's how I think the
masses will be able to get it--

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
is I can see a vast
internet program

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:84%
with health, education,
economics, science,

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And every day, the new
news is told by the people

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:90%
who are breaking through.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
They're telling, we
just learned to do this.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We've just figured out
how to feed people who've

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:90%
never been fed well before.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We have just-- and tell
that news, then show

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that the news is connected,
like Prigogine said,

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
in a nonlinear,
exponential interaction.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then invite the local
populace, wherever they may be,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
to respond to this question.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to create?

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you need to create it?

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And create lots of
small groups of people

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.662 align:middle line:90%
who want to create something.

00:27:37.662 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
As I probed into the meaning
of conscious evolution,

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I had a development of
evolutionary spirituality.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I had an expanded
vocation where I

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
would like to participate so
that everybody can know this.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:10%
I began to look at
all the innovations

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:10%
that exist in the world
and saw that we're already

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:10%
a species with new powers
in every single field.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I studied
a very brilliant man

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
called Ilya Prigogine, who won
the Nobel Prize for his study

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:90%
of dissipative structures.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Once I understood from Prigogine
that the way nature evolves is

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.290 align:middle line:84%
by connecting
innovations together

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:84%
until they self-organize
into a new system, what

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I saw was if we were to pull all
the innovations in every field

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have together,
nature itself

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
would help those
innovations to self-organize

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
into a new species that
was so much greater

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:90%
than the sum of our parts.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And with that understanding and
with the Teilhard de Chardin

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the direction
of evolution and with

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Bucky's understanding that we
have the resources, technology,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and know-how to make it work
and that reality is a verb,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:90%
not a noun--

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in other words, we're
active in this--

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
the tremendous excitement
of the new world

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
view for each one of us is
we are actors in this story.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
We are imbued with the impulse
of evolution ourselves.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And we are given evolution
by choice, not chance,

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:35.580 align:middle line:84%
because it looks to me like
God wants to create godlings,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that creator wants to
create co-creators,

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that we are not
determined by forces

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
greater than theirselves.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:84%
We are given the power to
be greater than ourselves.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And it looks to me like
our crisis is a birth

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and that the new
world view is humanity

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
being born as a universal
species with powers

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
we used to attribute to
gods and that to use them,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:90%
we have to be good co-creators.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So this view of reality in--
that comes from the new world

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
view is entirely different than
the idea that we're failing

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and things are going wrong
and technology is, ultimately,

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
only a danger.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really telling
us it's up to us.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for
leaders in every field,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
in every country, in every
culture who say, yes, this

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
is where I want to go
with my creativity.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
my culture can go.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
This is where my
civilization can go.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the same time frame that
we could destroy each other,

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
we could cross the threshold to
being the new species together.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's the
purpose of anybody's life

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:90%
who gets this.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:05.558 align:middle line:90%
