>> I'm Barbara Marx Hubbard
welcome to "Homo Universalis--

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.506 align:middle line:84%
Awakening The New
Species in Us."

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
The ancient human feelings
of separation and fear

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
dissolved as waves of love
attracted us to each other.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Our hearts opened.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts connected,
and we experience

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
the awesome intelligence of
ourselves as one living body.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:10%
What Christ and all other
avatars came to Earth to reveal

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.645 align:middle line:10%
is true.

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:90%
We are being born.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Our story is a birth.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.505 align:middle line:84%
We are one body, born
into the universe.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:10%
We are the first species ever
to know that we are evolving.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
We are the first
species ever to discover

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of 13.7
billion years of evolution

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:90%
going somewhere.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
We are the first species to know
that we're living at a shift

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:84%
point in evolution itself, from
the devolution of our species

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
toward the evolution of our
species to some unknown future.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And we also are
the first species

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to know we're affecting our own
evolution by everything that we

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
do, every impulse that we have,
every thought that we speak.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And we are, therefore, becoming
conscious evolutionaries.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
How do you know about what
you really want to do?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not on the surface.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy to know.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And here is the question
that I have found

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
gives you the chance to
respond inside yourself.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
What is my deepest
heart's desire?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:84%
That's not a superficial, I'd
like to have a better house,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.660 align:middle line:90%
or I want to take a trip.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Heart's desire is
buried in there.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:90%
And when you ask and listen--

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and, most specifically,
if you keep a journal.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It's really important, because
the deepest heart's desire

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is almost embedded in
your deeper consciousness.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you write in
your journal, question,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
what is my deepest
heart's desire?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And then learn to turn
off your thinking mind.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to figure it out.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I use double quotation
marks when I do that.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And simply listen internally
to any inspiration that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
comes through you, and without
thinking, write it down.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
important, don't think

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
writing when it's

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:90%
coming from your deeper mind.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Because often, the thinking
about it goes mental.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
If you go mental, the
deeper heart's desire

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:90%
may not reveal itself to you.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, I am a deep journal writer.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I've done it all my life,
since I was 18 years old,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:90%
so I'm good at this.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But I recommend that
we all get good at it.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Because these deeper
thoughts go fast.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
They're like your
inner scripture.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
If you don't pay attention to
them and write them somewhere,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:90%
they will go.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm suggesting
you keep a journal.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Ask, what is my deepest
heart's desire, until you

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:90%
begin to nurture it out.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The second great question
for all of us to ask,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
which also isn't
easy to answer, is,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
what is my unique genius to
respond to my deepest heart's

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:90%
desire?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
I've discovered, is

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
most of us don't know either
our deepest heart's desire

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
or our deepest genius code.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you discover your
deepest heart's desire

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and write it down
and begin to be

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
able to hold it in
your mental mind,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
as well, then you ask,
what is my genius code,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and do the same thing.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, my deepest heart's
desire is so and so.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you've discovered
at least something of it.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:90%
What is my genius code?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And start allowing
that to come forward.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, like everybody
has a hidden genetic code

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that comes forward
when sperm hits egg

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and you make a new baby.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
If I take an analogy,
everybody has a genius code,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't come out unless
it's inspired and attracted.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm declaring the need
for small group process here.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
The way I have
learned to do this

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is in small groups
that create resonance.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, resonance is
resounding with each other.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Resonance is a
feeling of safety.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Resonance is a feeling that
people will not be criticizing

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:90%
you for what you think or say.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:90%
You feel comfortable enough.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So you need to do it with
people that you feel safe with.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that small
group, when people

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:84%
start saying to each other,
my deepest heart's desire is,

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and they say it to
one another, they

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:90%
start to turn each other on.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So the deepest heart's
desire deepens.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you
should say, each one

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of you, my genius code to
activate this deepest heart's

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
desire is so and
so, what happens

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
is we see each
other as geniuses.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And this little
group of people that

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't know each
other deep starts

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
to know their deepest
heart's desire collectively,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and they know each
other's genius codes.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And they do that in
a resonant field.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And you know what happens?

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:90%
You get to feel empowered.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.136 align:middle line:84%
If you're discovering alone and
you're writing in your journal

00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're working it
through, you're taking walks,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
you're asking for guidance
in these questions,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and then you've created
a small resonant group

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
of people who are turning each
other on and becoming excited--

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and this is a type of
excitement when your--

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
your genius code, what
do you want to do?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, your genius code wants
to be expressed in the world.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:10%
Where and how are
you going to do this?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you look at the
wheel of co-creation,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.925 align:middle line:10%
the ring there is
called planetary DNA.

00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a
wonderful thought.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
You and I and we put our
deepest heart's desire

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
to create through our genius
code into the planetary DNA.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:84%
The planetary DNA is where
the structure of society

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to be created.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
See, in the past, we had some
terrible structures of society.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We had fascism,
Nazism, communism.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
We had mutually
assured destruction.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, what structure
of the new society

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
in the wheel of co-creation
do we want to create?

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting a
really great idea.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The new structure
of society should

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
be made up of our
deepest heart's

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
desires connected
in the planetary DNA

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.344 align:middle line:90%
or structure of our society.

00:08:33.344 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
In the wheel, if you see a
picture of the large wheel,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a ring
called planetary DNA.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And then right
after planetary DNA,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
you'll see golden
innovations that work.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:10%
These are innovations that
work in the larger society.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So you take your genius code and
what you want to create, put it

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
in the planetary DNA.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not saying yet it's a
total innovation that works.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a beginning.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But out of this
beginning, you're

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
finding others who are
also bringing forward

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:90%
their deepest heart's desire.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you start
looking at golden innovations

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:90%
that work.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
These are people in every
field where they're making

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:90%
new projects already working.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we do in the
wheel of co-creation

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
between planetary DNA, which
is new projects that are still

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
just being
inseminated, you might

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:84%
say, with those that
are already working,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:90%
we try to help each other.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We help each other
in the planetary DNA.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the people
who are very successful

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
will come in and help
you enter into one

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:90%
of their golden innovations.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:90%
So you start joining success.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Since I'm part of
this question, I

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
have been asking
myself, Barbara, what

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:90%
is your deepest heart's desire?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, actually, I've been working
at this for a long while.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So my deepest heart's
desire is pretty big.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
My deepest heart's desire
comes out of the recognition

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that we already have the
people, the projects,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and the possibilities
to make the world work.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And that in order for the
world to actually work,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.914 align:middle line:90%
we need to pull it together.

00:10:26.914 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be
able to pull it together

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in politics yet, but we can pull
it together on the internet.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So my deepest heart's desire is
a massively wonderful internet

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
program called the New News,
What's Working in the World.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you imagine
the arc of this--

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:90%
health, education, economics.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm imagining, on internet,
big as the lunar landing show.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the human
emergence show.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can
make it exciting.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Not, oh, well, the good
news is not interesting.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Was the lunar
landing interesting?

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes, because it was new.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:90%
It was awesome.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So the picture of what's
working in the world

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
through different ones of us is
equally great, if not greater,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
than the lunar
landing, because we're

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:90%
going to actually do this.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm imagining in this is
that very well-known people are

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
in every sector, and
all their followers

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and all their other
people are with us.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're beginning to share
not only with us directly what

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
they know that is
working, but then I'm

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
asking the question
of them, what do

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
you need to create more of it?

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
And what do you want to share?

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And we start social
synergy on the internet

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:90%
with the great leaders.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I did something like this
in Monterrey, Mexico,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
where we had leaders of the
government in Monterrey,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Mexico, doing the wheel.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And they all had projects
they wanted to create.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And we put them on the stage.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.475 align:middle line:84%
Now, this wasn't easy
to get them to do it.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:90%
These are government leaders.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They had to say what
they wanted to create

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and what they
needed to create it.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:90%
You know what they needed?

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%
They needed each other.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
The man who wanted
the environment

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to be more beautiful had
to turn to the artist.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
The artist spoke that this,
it would help the environment,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:90%
but they needed the media.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So the media said, well, we'd
like to communicate this,

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.092 align:middle line:90%
but we need the government.

00:12:29.092 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the
government said, well,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
we can't do this unless
the people ask us.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So what we saw was this point
that I've been making that

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the government cannot connect
the separate parts unless they

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:90%
go into a synergistic structure.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, each one
of these government officials

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
had their own department,
and they didn't synergize.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we sat in the audience
and watched these people

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
synergizing as our own
government officials,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I was able to get
up and say, this

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
is the way to organize
our governance.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't being idealistic, and
I wasn't being ahead of my time.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I was being right on time.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
The idea of social
synergy doesn't

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.275 align:middle line:84%
have to depend on being
synergistic government.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
It's needed there, but
it's needed everywhere.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these projects
out there in the world.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
We have them in every sector
of the wheel, and none of them

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
can fulfill themselves
totally unless they synergize

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:84%
with other projects that work
and with people just getting

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing
is every community

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
needs to develop its own
process for social synergy.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to say,
it's the new government.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to try to
take over the universities

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:90%
or the churches.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They invite the
universities, invite people

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
from the churches, invite
people from government

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
into a new space for synergistic
convergence in a wheel that

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have old power in it.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're not trying
to say, I'm going

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
to win to become
mayor of this city.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to be able to
be the best communicator.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
You're actually giving
people the chance

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to find that all
the parts can do

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
better when they
cooperate with other parts

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:90%
than when they compete.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:84%
We all know that
competition has a value.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're an
athlete, and competition

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:90%
may make you better.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.920 align:middle line:84%
You go to the Olympics
because you competed well.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not denying the
importance of competition.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But when we are at a
society that can break down

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and all of us can
be almost destroyed

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
by our misuse of power, we have
a new requirement in society.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's to develop the
process of social synergy.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The wheel represents
the whole system.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And here is an insight that
we learn from evolution--

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
nature takes jumps by
creating whole systems greater

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:90%
than the sum of their parts.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
A whole system is something
that's not just additive

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:90%
of health education, economics.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a system like your body.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We've learned, in
healing our own bodies,

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that if we have a
heart failure, we

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:90%
don't just look at the heart.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at the
lungs and the liver

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and the brain and
everything else.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned
holistic medicine.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I am suggesting holistic
social-organizational patterns,

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
where we apply
whole-body development

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to our communities, our
states, our nations,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and, eventually, our world.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to find
that the old structure will

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:84%
fade away, very much
like in Great Britain.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The monarchy still
exists, but they like it.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful, but
it doesn't have power.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
If people in every sector of the
wheel who are already leaders,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:84%
who already have large numbers
of followers, who have already

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
written books and tapes,
who already know what's

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
working at the growing edge of
health, education, economics,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
governance were to join together
to look for common goals

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and match needs with resources
for the sake of each one

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:90%
of them to do better--

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
this is not
competition to do less.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
It's competition for everyone
to do more or co-creation.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We're developing a
society of co-creators.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I like the word co-creator
more than cooperator.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the creative
intention inside

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of you connecting to
the creative intention

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
inside somebody else creates
an awesome greatness more than

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
the sum of our parts, which
is what nature has been

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:90%
doing for billions of years.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
So the pattern of the whole is
more than the sum of its parts,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:84%
like your body is more than
the sum of 52 trillion cells,

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:90%
they say, is in you.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I've
just thought about it.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's get them all out.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would happen.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
You create an eye or an ear or
a hand or a thumb or anything.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:90%
The sum of the parts--

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Bucky Fuller used to do this.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
When somebody said she didn't
like technology, he said,

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Madam, do you like your thumb?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And he went like this.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
When the thumb wiggled, he
said, how did I do that?

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, I had a thought.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It went through
the nervous system.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:90%
It moved my thumb.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know I
was doing any of it.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's because my body
has learned how to do this.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, a social body is also
potentially a whole system.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So if, let's say,
media has a thought

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that what needs to be
done for environment,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
like we did in Monterrey, that
needs to be done for health,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts connect with
each other vibrationally

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and quickly.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can do it
also through internet,

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
so that each part
gets to be more

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:90%
by saying yes to the other.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there is a genuine
competition, where there's

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:84%
a real win-lose, we find, first
of all, that is usually not

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:90%
fully the case.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:84%
The case is they haven't
thought of what they

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:90%
need to create together yet.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So competition goes down
in the scale of importance,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and co-creation and joining
genius goes up in the scale.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
because it feels good,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
because it gives pleasure,
because it awakens your sense

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:90%
of creativity and friendship--

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
we want to do more
of what feels good.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't feel
good to try to annihilate

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:90%
each other out of the ballpark.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things why
politics has become so vicious

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
is it's all about
win-lose all the way.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And really, there are
winners and losers,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's the truth.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So synergistic
democracy, everybody

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
will do more by connecting
than they do this way.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really talking
about the evolution

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.467 align:middle line:84%
of social and
political structure.

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if we
had the New News Network?

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And on this New News Network,
you're hearing new news.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Not breakdown news,
but breakthrough news.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're also saying,
as you do something that's

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
breakthrough, and a person
or group is saying it,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:84%
they will be saying
to each other,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
as well as to the general
public, we need this in order

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to create it.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Could anybody help?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The New News could be a call
for greater social action.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I ran for vice
president on this.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, what we should
do is scan for, map,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
connect, and communicate
what's working.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So instead of trying to do
it in the vice presidency,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's do a news program
and call it the New News.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:90%
We can all do that.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.795 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'm saying is doable
by us, small scale or large.

00:20:46.795 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Keep that global structure of
the wheel before your thoughts,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
a structure that's

00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
designed for social
synergy in our society.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.060 align:middle line:84%
The wheel structurally reveals
we're one planetary body,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:90%
whether it's local or global.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, we've
learned, in health,

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.510 align:middle line:90%
to have holistic health.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying we need
holistic social change

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:90%
as a whole system.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm imagining, in my highest
vision of what's possible,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is a planetary
awakening, a global turn

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
on of us en masse to see
these are the things that we

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:90%
are doing that works.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
This is what we need to create.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we form local
groups everywhere

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures,
in different cities,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
in different
circumstances so people

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:90%
can find each other to create.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And that starts going
upward toward the New News.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we're
creating a new society

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
based on human desire to create
our deepest heart's desire

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:90%
and to activate our genius code.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm imagining a certain kind of
music that is a cosmic lullaby.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It activates something
in us vibrationally.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm calling for the
musicians to help us do this.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So that when we hear
it, we feel resonance.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:90%
We feel an inner vibration.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:84%
We feel something
growing within us.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the most
important pieces of music

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
that could ever be written.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on
our internet show,

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and we become awakened
by the inner music

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:90%
as well as by the outer action.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And born from these kinds
of events, small and large,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:84%
we are nurturing,
within each one of us,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:58.506 align:middle line:84%
the new species we're
calling Homo Universalis.

00:22:58.506 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a species that's
awakened to the inner impulse

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:84%
A species whose
vocation is turned on.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
A species who knows the
innovations that are happening.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
A species that is able to
guide high tech genius--

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence,
nanotech, genetics,

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:90%
robotics-- with love.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the new
species, and we're new.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:90%
We're new.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:84%
The big point of
this whole thing

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:84%
is like the birth
of a newborn child.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:90%
The child doesn't like it.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.525 align:middle line:84%
Birth is painful, and it
was comfortable in the womb.

00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And many of us were
comfortable before all of this,

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, we're
out and we're crying.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:90%
We're upset.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But there's a point in
the life of the newborn,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
if all goes normally,
is the mother

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
takes that newborn,
holds it in her arm,

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and it hears her heartbeat.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And it is said we usually
nurse the baby in the left arm

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:84%
so the baby's nervous
system hears the heartbeat.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And the most beautiful
thing is the baby's smile.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
My sense is we are on the
threshold of a planetary smile.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We have to nurture what we
are that's good with love.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Very much like the
mother and father

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
have to nurture the
newborn with love.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a mess.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It isn't even beautiful
most of the time.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:90%
But the mother loves it.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:84%
The father loves it, and
the father loves the mother,

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and the mother loves the father.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So who's going to
love each other here?

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to love each other
nearby and large scale

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world and
infuse empathy into the planet.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Infuse love among ourselves.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And recognize we're
at the threshold

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of conscious
evolution, evolution

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:90%
by choice, not chance.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And it looks to me like the
creative source of the universe

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:90%
wants to create co-creators.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
That God wants to
create godlings.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
That evolution wants to create
conscious evolutionaries.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And that you and I, as
individual within it,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
want to participate
in an evolving,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:90%
consciously loving world.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So when I say we're
becoming Homo Universalis,

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:90%
how come we're doing this?

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:84%
We've been Homo sapiens
sapiens for quite some time.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me
they're out of Homo

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
sapiens sapiens has come, in
recent past, great avatars

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and great humans.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't look like it
would be all the rest of us.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
entire sequence of evolution,

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
evolution creates more
consciousness, more freedom,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and more loving order
for billions of years.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'm making a pretty
rational assumption

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that if evolution has been
creating more love, more

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
creativity, more genius
for billions of years,

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:90%
it's doing it inside of us.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm suggesting-- and
I'm not just suggesting.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm declaring that
every one of us, when

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
we tap into our
deepest heart's desire

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and awaken our genius
code, are tapping

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
into the impulse of
evolution internalized

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
as your own heart's desire
and your own genius code.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And that impulse is leading
toward more love, more

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:90%
creativity, and more freedom.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So evolution by
choice not chance,

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
evolution by connecting
what's loving and creative,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
evolution that's going over
the threshold to the radically

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
new, evolution that's moving
ourselves from creating

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth into
space, evolution

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that realizes there are
billions of galaxies out there--

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:90%
folks, imagination creates.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And imagining this right
now is helping create it.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Because imagination is not
simply just a superficial

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Nature is affected
by what we imagine.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you put it into the
zero point field of energy,

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
which we could call the energy
underneath of all reality--

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
we put our imagination
into the energy

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of the impulse of evolution--

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:84%
we are actually becoming
co-creators right now.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So what's actually
happening here,

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
by activating my
own legacy, where

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I've been really invited to
look in to see what is my legacy

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and what is your legacy--

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
because you should ask yourself
exactly the same thing.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
What I have discovered that my
deepest inner impulse or legacy

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:84%
is to move myself and all
others toward becoming

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Homo Universalis with the powers
of ancient gods used with love.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's my intention.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It's probably almost
everybody's intention.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, though,
unless we think about it

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:42.585 align:middle line:84%
and make our legacy known,
we don't intend it overtly.

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's all place our
impulse to create

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:84%
a world that works for all
in our imagination right now.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's imagine it together.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
We know that
imagination creates.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:84%
As we imagine this
together right now,

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:84%
we are helping to
create it and becoming,

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:84%
actually, participants in our
own conscious evolution now.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a thought
that's occurring

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to me that I've repeated
internally for many years.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Behold, I show you a mystery.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:90%
We shall not all sleep.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:90%
We shall all be changed.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, now.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
We are all being
changed every instant.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we know it,
we can say, thank you,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and participate
consciously in it

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and become conscious
co-creators of our world.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
As I'm remembering
what turned me

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
on not only to realizing my own
heart's desire but to realizing

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:84%
my heart's desire for the
larger world and my genius code,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
not just from my own particular
expression but the genius

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
code of humanity as an
intention that I was having--

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
the way I experienced it, I had
been reading the New Testament.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, I come from an
agnostic background,

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't reading it--

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I was reading it
as an evolutionary.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked the
universal Christ a question,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:90%
and here's the question.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:84%
What story could
we tell that would

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
be as great as the story
they told about you?

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And the answer that I
got from the universe

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
was, Barbara, go tell the
story of the birth of humanity

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
that can heal the
Earth, free the people,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.145 align:middle line:90%
and explore the universe.

00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Barbara.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I got my assignment,
go tell the story.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And once I got that,
I had the experience

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:90%
that I am evolution, evolving.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is evolution, evolving.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:90%
So I was able to continue--

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
this was way back
maybe 30 years ago.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I was able to continue
expressing this

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
with a feeling of being part of
evolution itself expressing it,

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
rather than a personal
decision on my part.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, as I was
realizing it for myself,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it's
true for everybody.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And you do need to say yes to
it in order to activate it.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:90%
