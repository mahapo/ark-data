00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Bring your attention
to your breath,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.880 align:middle line:84%
allowing the breath
to be natural.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.630 align:middle line:84%
In previous
meditations, we've been

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
limiting the mind's attention
to the area of the nose.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
The mind's attention is like
the aperture of a camera.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It can focus narrowly, or it
can engage in a wider focus.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Start by bringing awareness
to the sensations at the nose

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
as well as any
sounds of the breath.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to expand the
attention, no longer limiting

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
our awareness to the
breath of the nose

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
but zooming out to include the
whole body, perhaps noticing

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
the rise and fall of the
rib cage, the rise and fall

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:90%
of the belly.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there are sensations
in the head changing

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:90%
as you breathe in and out.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Observe the expansion
and contraction

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.175 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Allow the attention
to be open and wide,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
noticing even the most subtle
sensations on each inhalation

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and exhalation.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
On each in breath, become
aware of sensations

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.267 align:middle line:84%
With each out breath,
be aware of sensations

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of when the
body is breathing in

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and when it's breathing out.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to become conscious of
the entire field of expansion

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and contraction
throughout the body.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
You could call it the somatic
field, the feeling body,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:90%
or the pranic field.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the field of
changing phenomena,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
the field of energy at the
root level of sensation

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
or the subtlest level of
sensation perceivable.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:84%
You are feeling the
intelligence of the body,

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the body.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't miss any sensation.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:84%
It may be easy to
observe gross sensation,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.445 align:middle line:90%
but don't miss the subtle.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
This field of change
is breathing you.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It is making your
belly rise and fall.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%
It is beating your heart.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:90%
It's digesting your food.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.885 align:middle line:90%
It's growing your hair.

00:04:55.885 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
The expansion and
contraction of the breath

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.895 align:middle line:84%
is touching every
cell in your body.

00:05:03.895 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to drop
even the word breath

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and just stay with the
pranic field underlying

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.145 align:middle line:90%
all of the senses.

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
We're observing the
pattern of change itself.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
This inner energy is
not something other

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
than what you are feeling.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It is your inner
aliveness, whatever

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
you're feeling in this moment.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Don't look for something special
or try to produce something.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Go into this moment deeply
without any expectations.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
All sensations, feelings,
and thoughts are impermanent.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It is in their nature
to arise and pass away.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The ego structure is
nothing but attachment

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:90%
to something that is changing.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
If you let go of
those attachments,

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:90%
you let go of the limited you.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Inner energy becomes free to
connect with more of life.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.245 align:middle line:84%
Another name for this
connection is love.

00:08:53.245 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:84%
As you do this practice, you
may experience resistance.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.715 align:middle line:90%
Various hindrances may arise.

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts may arise.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:90%
You might get tired.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:90%
You might experience pain.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may start to
generate fantasies or get

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:90%
lost in memories.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may get bored and
want something to happen.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the hindrance,
you want to be completely

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
conscious of its pattern
within the field of changing

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:90%
sensation.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Remain conscious of the
sensations, the pattern that

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
is arising, the location
in the body, the intensity,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
how it changes over time.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Just remain aware without
reacting, without preference.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
The hindrance is only a
problem when we are not

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:90%
consciously aware of it.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
A hindrance is actually
not a hindrance

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
at all but an
invitation to become

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
more conscious of
a certain aspect

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:90%
of your mind-body structure.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
When challenges arise,
they are the very things

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:90%
that advance your practice.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So don't try to get
rid of the hindrance,

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
but go into it consciously.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Inhabit it.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
The hindrance is the
inner intelligence saying,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:90%
bring consciousness here.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Let go of all
seeking, all wanting.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Keep coming back to observing
sensations throughout the body,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
feeling the expansion and
contraction of the breath,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
letting go of all
control of the breath,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:90%
letting the body breathe itself.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Your job as a meditator
is to remain aware,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to get yourself out of the way.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
At times, the body may be
like a hurricane of sensation,

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
but you can stay in the
stillness at the center.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Remain in the center of the
spiral of changing phenomena.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:90%
