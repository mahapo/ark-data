00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Start by finding your
position that you will be

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.740 align:middle line:84%
comfortable in for the next
10 minutes without moving

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.540 align:middle line:90%
or shifting.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Observe the sensations
within the nose,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
recognizing the dimension
of stillness within you.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.185 align:middle line:90%
Let go of control, of all doing.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.365 align:middle line:84%
Let the body take
the next breath.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.225 align:middle line:90%
Allow yourself to be breathed.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
The sensations and
phenomena within the nose

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.765 align:middle line:90%
are constantly changing.

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But there is something
that is not changing,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
something that is aware
of what is changing.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.255 align:middle line:84%
Who or what is
watching the breath?

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the awareness
that is observing the breath.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.475 align:middle line:90%
Always being present.

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Always being equanimous
with whatever

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:90%
is arising and passing away.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Awareness has no preferences.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.045 align:middle line:90%
It is simply aware.

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
preference, judging

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
a sensation as good or
bad, it's just a thought,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.575 align:middle line:90%
a fluctuation of the mind.

00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
When you react to
that preference,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
you feed energy into the
pattern, reinforcing it.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Be equanimous.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
To be equanimous means
you have no preferences.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
You are resting as
awareness, aware

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.475 align:middle line:90%
that you are not the mind.

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't shift away
from the discomforts

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
or react to
unpleasant sensations.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, don't grasp
at pleasant sensations

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:90%
if they arise.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
If pleasant
sensations arise, you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
can lose equanimity if you start
craving or try to hold them.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
As you observe the
breath, find out who

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
or what is observing,
who or what is aware.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Stay with this inquiry
single pointedly,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
unbroken, continuous.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The mind's attention
is fully on the breath.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.335 align:middle line:90%
And you are simply aware.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
If the mind is
generating thoughts,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
if other sensations are
happening within the body,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:90%
stay still.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Stay with the breath.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Don't get caught in other
thoughts and sensations.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Don't get hooked by them.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:90%
But don't push them away.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Stay single pointedly
with the breath.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't be rigid about it.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Be relaxed.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.255 align:middle line:84%
But don't be so relaxed that
you become dull or foggy.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Remain alert, surrendered,
but determined, and patient.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Be here now.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And be accepting of everything
arising in the mind and body.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no point in generating
inner resistance to your mind

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
No point in struggling
against yourself.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Let go of your controlling.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to make
anything happen.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself merge
into the breath.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Let you go.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Become so intimate
with the breath

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
that you let yourself
merge into it.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Notice the awareness that
is unmoving, unchanging.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:90%
It has no location, no quality.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Who is there in
that stillness, that

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
emptiness that is
everywhere and nowhere,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.435 align:middle line:90%
beyond the mind and senses?

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Let go of all doing.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Be still and know.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.315 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Awareness can recognize itself.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Stillness can wake up.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Surrender to
silence, to stillness

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
without reacting,
without preferences,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.135 align:middle line:84%
without identifying with
thought or pushing away thought.

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Be like a candle
burning itself up.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Let you go.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Let you go.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Let you go.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:90%
