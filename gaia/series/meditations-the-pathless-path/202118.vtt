00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Be here in this moment, just
sitting, choicelessly present,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.580 align:middle line:84%
aware without attending
to any sensory object.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Yet, allowing energy to flow
freely through the senses.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the aliveness of
this moment to be as it is.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Simply abide with what is.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Remaining present,
intimately connected

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.475 align:middle line:84%
with what is happening, without
thinking, without mediation

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:56.275 align:middle line:90%
by the mind.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
There are two
fundamental patterns

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that lock us into identification
with the limited mind.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Our body wants to feel good.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
We crave the experience of
what is pleasant, or what

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
is predictable, what is known.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And our mind wants
to know, it wants

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
to feel that it is in control.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
When the mind believes
that it knows,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:90%
it feels that it is in control.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:90%
The body wants to feel good.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
The mind wants to know.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
These are the two
unconscious processes

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:90%
that we make conscious.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
We sit with no preference,
no preference toward what

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:90%
the body experiences.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And we sit OK with not knowing.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We let go of any idea that
one sensation is positive

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and another negative.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
There is just sensation,
just aliveness,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
an endless field of
changing phenomena.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Let go of discrimination
between this and that.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Let go of perception of things.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:84%
When there are no preferences,
no perception of things,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
there are no reactions, no
pushing away, and no clinging.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
You stop feeding
the egoic patterns.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You stop being
interested or fixated

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.525 align:middle line:84%
with particular sensations
or particular thoughts.

00:03:39.525 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
We come to this place
of choiceless awareness

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:84%
not by doing and not by
attempting to stop doing.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We come to this place by
recognizing the truth,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
by recognizing who
or what is constantly

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.765 align:middle line:84%
doing, who or what
has been in control.

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Don't assume that you know
what these words mean.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Don't assume that you know what
it means for the mind and body

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:90%
to drop off.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Investigate with
a beginner's mind.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Let go of any idea that
you have to disappear,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
or that there's some void,
or that there is no self.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
If you hold these concepts,
they can be obstacles.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.455 align:middle line:84%
Some teachers say you
have to become no one.

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But don't let this
become a concept.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Non-dual union is beyond all
notions of self and no self.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.985 align:middle line:84%
All of these concepts
are barriers.

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Minds dropping off doesn't
mean there's no mind.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It is neither mind nor no mind.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%
It is neither self nor no self.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
You could say mind
becomes unlimited

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
so it is no longer your mind,
no longer personal mind.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It is the filter or
limitation that drops off.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.035 align:middle line:84%
Surrender your will, your
wanting to the spiritual heart.

00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't get snagged by
the material world,

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:90%
the world of changing forms.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And don't dwell in
inner emptiness.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The truth is beyond this
duality of form and emptiness.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Realize form as exactly
emptiness, emptiness

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%
as exactly form.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.565 align:middle line:84%
Then all duality
vanishes by itself.

00:07:31.565 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Just sit, being OK with what
is, being OK with not knowing.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing is a gateway
to all realization.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.955 align:middle line:84%
Let go of time and space and
remain awake in the eternal

00:09:09.955 --> 00:09:10.755 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
When you remain continuously
awake, dreams vanish.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't deny the reality of the
world or you will miss it.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe in the reality of
the world or you will suffer.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Denying or affirming, you
remain trapped on the level

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
of the limited mind.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:84%
The limited mind is a
distortion of the truth.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Realize what is beyond concepts.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.675 align:middle line:84%
Experience this moment raw
and unprocessed by the mind.

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:84%
If you realize this
one truth, the truth

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of being in this moment
without the filter

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
of the conditioned
mind, then it is

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
like a sword that cuts through
all delusion in a single blow.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:90%
