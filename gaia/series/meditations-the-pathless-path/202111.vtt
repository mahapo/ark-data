00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient teachings say
that meditation is being with

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.710 align:middle line:90%
reality as it is.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.060 align:middle line:84%
One thing you can't deny is
that there is the experience

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:90%
of a body here breathing.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can use that as
the starting point.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
We use the breath to anchor
us in the now in what's real.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The breath can guide us out
of the labyrinth of the mind

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.325 align:middle line:90%
to the present moment.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
To start, we will
simply focus on the air

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:90%
moving through the nose.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Put your attention on your
nose and just experience

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
the air going in and out.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:84%
When you are
breathing in, notice

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%
that you're breathing in.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
When you're
breathing out, notice

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:90%
that you're breathing out.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Let the breath be natural.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't control it in any way.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Let the intelligence of
the body move the breath.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be
aware of this one thing

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to develop
concentration.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We are going to feel
the sensations moving

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
through the nose and the
nostrils, whatever sensations

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:90%
are there.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
There might be a tingling
sensation, a feeling of heat,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
of coolness, a pressure, a
feeling of the air flowing.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Just observe whatever is there.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts may come up and
interfere with your meditation

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts may come, but we
are going to consciously

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
let go of any interest
in them to avoid

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
getting lost in the stories
of the past and future.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
If your attention goes
to some internal dialogue

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:84%
or mental images, simply
return back to the breath

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and be aware that the thoughts
may try to continually hook

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:90%
your attention.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Keep observing the breath
single pointedly, the air

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%
moving in and out of the nose.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Allow it to anchor
your attention.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand
that the mind doesn't

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
need to stop its activity.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to suppress or
try to make the mind blank.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
You simply become
disinterested in it.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
The more fully our
attention is held

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
with the experience
of the breath,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
the less it is
going to be caught

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
in the mind or other
sensory distractions.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
The mind will come up
with all kinds of ways

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
to divert your attention.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Stay alert and vigilant.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't get caught in the thoughts
and don't push them away.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:90%
This is the middle way.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Let everything be as it is.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't control or manipulate
your thoughts in any way.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
If you try to manipulate
your thoughts,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
then you're trying
to achieve something.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
This is just another idea,
just another thought.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Your meditation will
become a battle.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And the only one you're
fighting is yourself.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Give up all interest
in thoughts.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Give up trying to achieve
anything and abide

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
with the breath, being
thoughtlessly aware,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.595 align:middle line:90%
watching the breath.

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:90%
It's blissful.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
It's peaceful if you drop
your inner resistance.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is simply letting
everything be as it is.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Wait for the next breath
to arrive on its own.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Don't take the next breath.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.695 align:middle line:90%
Let the breath take you.

00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of
control of the breath,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:90%
there may be a bit of fear.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
You may have an impulse
to take a deep breath.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Trust the body.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Trust that it knows
how to breathe.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to do
in this meditation other

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.655 align:middle line:90%
than observe the breath.

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
It may become obvious what
the mind is already doing.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly
generating thoughts.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But you keep coming
back to the breath.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Stay in the now.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
If sensations arise
elsewhere in the body,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:84%
pleasant, unpleasant, or
neutral, ignore them for now.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.465 align:middle line:84%
Limit awareness to the
sensations in the nose.

00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:90%
The mind will sometimes wander.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
All of the sudden, you
might be lost in a thought.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The moment you
remember, you come back

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:31.915 align:middle line:84%
into the present moment, back to
the breath, back to the breath,

00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:32.715 align:middle line:90%
back to the breath.

00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:90%
This is the practice.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Don't get frustrated.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
You can just smile
at the situation.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the human situation,
the human condition.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:90%
The mind is very undisciplined.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The longer you sit in
presence without moving,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:84%
without reacting, the
more intense sensations

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
may arise and offer
the possibility

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:90%
of deeper purification.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I will stop talking
so you can sit in silence.
