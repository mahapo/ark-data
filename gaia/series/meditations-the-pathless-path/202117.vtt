00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>> As we progress in meditation,
there are less and less useful

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:84%
techniques that can be provided
because there is less and less

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.095 align:middle line:90%
mind activity, less doing.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:84%
We come closer to
realizing stillness

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
or, more accurately, we realize
that primordial awareness that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:84%
is beyond stillness and
movement but yet is exactly

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
stillness and movement.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We realize the stillness within
the movement, the movement

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:90%
within the stillness.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Another way to say
this is that we

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
realize the field of
change, the inner energy

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to be empty of self or to
be devoid of limitation.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
From here on in, I
won't be providing much

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in the way of
actual instructions

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
but rather pointing
out different ways

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is
operating, distorting

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:90%
your experience of this moment.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Once these mind patterns
become conscious,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
they will naturally drop away.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to add more
to our conditioned mind,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
but rather to free the
energy from the limited mind

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
so that it circulates freely,
rewiring us and growing

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life within,
growing the organs of higher

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
spiritual perception,
which connect you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
to the hidden
aspects of yourself.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Your physical, subtle,
and causal bodies

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
are like a bridge from
the time-bound world

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:90%
to the timeless.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Upon awakening, this
entire tree of life

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.315 align:middle line:90%
is realized to be empty of self.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is being
attentive to what

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
is without judging, labeling,
or having preferences

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.415 align:middle line:90%
based on past memories.

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
It's being present with what
is in a way that is unmediated

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
by the egoic itself.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If the limited mind moves, it
is due to some dissatisfaction

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
with what is.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
When we make those hidden
mental processes of craving

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and aversion conscious,
they drop away

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
just as shadows disappear
when the light is turned on.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
If we don't dispel
these shadows,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
there will always be a
veil separating part of me

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
from my self.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, Samadhi, is
uncovering and uniting

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:90%
all parts of yourself.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
If parts of you remain
hidden, those parts

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
run like programs
in the unconscious,

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and they remain in
control of your life.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Being present without
attending to thoughts

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
allows your energy
to be free rather

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
than trapped in old patterns.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
When energy is free,
it moves according

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to its own intelligence,
a higher level of mind.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
If I continue to tell you how to
meditate or how to be present,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be paying
attention to my words

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
rather than what is arising
in your present moment.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully in
hearing these words,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
there will be a dawning
of the truth of realizing

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:90%
what meditation is.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
If I give you a technique, then
you will try to do something,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and that doing will keep the
whirlpool of the mind active.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the part of
the practice where

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
we let go of the technique,
which is simply a thorn

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to remove a thorn or
a conditioned pattern

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.905 align:middle line:90%
to remove conditioned patterns.

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The Zen Master Dogen said that
meditation is the dropping off

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.295 align:middle line:90%
of mind and body.

00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
To realize the dropping
off of mind and body,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
he gave the
instruction, just sit.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
In these meditations,
we are going

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
to just sit, allowing
all concepts,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
all activities of the
mind that may already

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
be in play to be as they are,
not getting caught in them,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:90%
not pushing them away.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:84%
This is sometimes called
choiceless awareness.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:90%
The body is physically sitting.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The mind is aware
that it is sitting,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.570 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the sitting so
completely that you are inside

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:90%
You merge with it.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
You become the sitting.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:90%
The sitting becomes you.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
The meditator and the
meditation become one.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.175 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness to the
sense of time passing.

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Notice if you are
unconsciously holding the idea

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.785 align:middle line:84%
that there's a beginning or
end to the meditation practice.

00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Surrender to the eternal now.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Any concept of time is
simply that, a concept

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.915 align:middle line:90%
stored in the mind.

00:08:33.915 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
When this moment is unfiltered
by past conditioning,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:90%
there is only the now.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:84%
There is no psychological time
if we are abiding as awareness.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.315 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there is
no end to time.

00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
All becoming unfolds
within the eternal now.
