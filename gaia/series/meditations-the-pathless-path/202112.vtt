00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Start in a comfortable
position, spine straight.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't be rigid but
don't be too relaxed.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't slump.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention
to the natural breath,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:84%
focused on the breath
going through the nose.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.535 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
relaxed yet alert.

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Make an intention to
stay in that position.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Experience the breath as it is.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.985 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to hear
subtle breathing sounds.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.375 align:middle line:84%
Listen for any subtle
sound of the breath.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
When you are
breathing in, notice

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
that you're breathing in.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:84%
When you're
breathing out, notice

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:90%
that you're breathing out.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Notice if you're
controlling or contracting

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:90%
the breath in any way.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:84%
When your mind becomes
aware of the breath,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:90%
its tendency is to control it.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.585 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to move by itself.

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't take a breath.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Let the body take the breath.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.815 align:middle line:84%
It's like waiting for waves
to arise on the ocean.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Wait for the wave to
arise and pass away.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Notice when the air's going
in, when it's going out.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
In this meditation,
we're going to go deeper

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
into the sensations
within the nose area.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
There may be obvious sensations,
gross, physical sensations,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
but we want to observe
the subtle as well.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The longer you can stay
in contact with the breath

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
uninterrupted, the
more subtle sensations

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:90%
you'll be able to observe.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Let the sensations
change freely,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:90%
tracking them moment by moment.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Don't miss any
aspect or quality.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.985 align:middle line:84%
Here I mean any pattern
associated with the breath.

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The breath might be deep
or it might be shallow.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.725 align:middle line:84%
There might be a large volume
of air or a small volume.

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.465 align:middle line:84%
There could be
tingling in the nose.

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
There could be heat or maybe
coolness, itching, pulsation.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The air going in might be
cooler than the air going out

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there's more air
going through one nostril

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:90%
than the other.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Feel the pulsation
of the breath,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of the breath
occurring through time.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Notice if that pattern
is changing through time,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:90%
but be careful not to control.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't assume that you know what
the next breath will be like.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Let your mind be a beginner's
mind, a curious mind,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.115 align:middle line:84%
a not knowing mind,
but an interested mind.

00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't look for anything special.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Let yourself come to stillness.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
We can't do anything
to come to stillness,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:90%
because doing is movement.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.035 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:37.835 align:middle line:90%
Just be.

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Just observe the breath
that is happening.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We are observing raw
sensation, waves, or vibration,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
flowing, expanding, contracting.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
What we call energy or prana
is not something esoteric.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a subtle sensation
arising and passing away.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.695 align:middle line:90%
It is sensation changing.

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:31.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being interested
in particular sensations,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.855 align:middle line:84%
we want to observe the
pattern of change itself.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Subtle sensations and
patterns of change

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
are important to take us from
the gross, physical, particular

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
world to the subtle wave-like
world or the world of energy.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Be OK with what is.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Surrender to what is,
but be aware of what is.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
This is equanimity,
having no preference

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of one sensation over another,
no preference about anything

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that is happening.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Attention and equanimity are
the two fundamental aspects

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
of practice, always
being present and always

00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
surrendering, not judging,
not reacting, not trying

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to escape from this
moment, showing up fully

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
in this moment, letting all
sensations arise and pass away,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:90%
not doing but simply being.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:25.024 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Being with the
breath intimately.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
The longer you sit in
presence without moving,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
without reacting, more
intense sensations may arise,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and the deeper your
surrender must be,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and the more equanimity
will be cultivated,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and the deeper the purification.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:90%
