00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these instructions
point towards just sitting.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.230 align:middle line:84%
It may seem like I'm
asking you to do something,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
but there is literally nothing
to do in this meditation.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The meditation is the dropping
of the doing and the doer.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Sitting is just what is left
when there is no more doing

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:90%
and no doer.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
There are many stages of
absorption into this moment,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:90%
into what is.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
With each stage of
absorption into this moment,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.735 align:middle line:84%
there is a dropping away of
conditioned mind patterns.

00:00:40.735 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It's sometimes said
that to realize samadhi,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
it's best to sit as if you
will be sitting forever,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.405 align:middle line:84%
without any sense of time,
without a goal or destination,

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:23.205 align:middle line:90%
without thought.

00:01:23.205 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:10%
Don't turn this dropping off
of mind and body into a goal.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
If you turn samadhi
into a goal, it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:84%
becomes an activity
in the mind or

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:90%
an unconscious identification.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
When you are awake here
and now, what is realized

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is the primordial awareness
was always present.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And all stages of
absorption in this moment

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
are ultimately illusory.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But until awakening is
realized, the practice

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:84%
helps to make the limited
self-structure more

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:90%
permeable to awareness.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Let go of all preferences,
pleasant and unpleasant

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:90%
sensations.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.705 align:middle line:84%
Let go of any discrimination
between this and that.

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Let go of any interest
in thoughts whatsoever.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Notice if your mind is
fabricating an external world,

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
a sense of things
constructed by thoughts.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Notice if you are retreating
into inner emptiness

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:90%
and pushing away thoughts.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Let go of both the inner
and the outer worlds.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Don't get caught in the
outer world of name and form.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And don't try to
escape into emptiness.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.745 align:middle line:84%
Let everything be exactly as
it is, realizing the truth.

00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
It is the limited dualistic mind
that creates inner and outer.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Witness the witness.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Observe the observer.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The observer is neither inner
nor outer but is aware of all.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
If you observe the observer
and you see something,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
some object, then it is the
false self, the false eye.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.405 align:middle line:84%
Keep inquiring into
who or what is looking.

00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Find out who or what you are
beyond the mind and senses.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Realize the self, which
does not come and go.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
If it comes and goes,
it is not the true self.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
If phenomena arises,
be equanimous

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
with it, unmoved, unshaken,
inhabiting it fully.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Be present with what is
arising, fully conscious.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Don't get distracted
by what the eyes see.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Recognize emptiness
within all things.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that by which
seeing is possible.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Don't get distracted
by what the ears hear.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Hear silence within all sound.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Recognize sound as silence.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that by which
hearing is possible.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Don't get distracted
by what the body feels.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Recognize stillness
within the movement,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:90%
within the field of change.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Recognize stillness as movement
and movement as stillness.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Emptiness dancing.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Realize that by which
feeling is possible.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
To see the luminous emptiness,
to hear the music of silence,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to feel the emptiness
dancing, we simply

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
experience this moment as it is,
unmediated by a limited self.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:84%
All is empty, unlimited
awareness, dancing as energy,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:90%
prana, or love.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The truth is neither
found through perception

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:90%
nor through nonperception.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Let the entire
universe be your mind.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
If the universe is
your mind, then there

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:90%
is no other than mind.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
There is no you and
nothing other than you.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
When mind is limited,
it is the egoic self.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.835 align:middle line:84%
When it is unlimited,
it is your true nature.

00:11:46.835 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Meditation has no
beginning and no end.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:84%
It does not end when you
get up from the cushion

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%
if it's true meditation.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have understood,
not with the understanding

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.795 align:middle line:84%
of the limited mind, but
with the hearts knowing.

00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is not something
separate from life.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Meditation is life.
