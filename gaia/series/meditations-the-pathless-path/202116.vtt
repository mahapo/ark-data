00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Start with the
beginner's mind,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle line:84%
forgetting everything you
know about meditation.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Let go of all concepts and
expectations each time you set

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and investigate freshly
into this moment.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:90%
There is a body here breathing.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Discover it.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Inhabit it with
consciousness and simply feel

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the pulsation of
expansion and contraction

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.995 align:middle line:84%
Notice the connections between
body, mind, and breath.

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Let go of all
concepts and observe

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
the raw sensations, the
field of changing phenomena.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.875 align:middle line:84%
Observe the field of change
directly, free of concepts.

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
The eyes are either
closed or half open,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.585 align:middle line:84%
gazing softly towards the
nose, not focusing on anything.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Widen the aperture of the
mind to observe the expansion

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and contraction of the breath
throughout the entire body,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.505 align:middle line:84%
not missing any sensation,
no matter how subtle.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to observe
the field of expansion

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and contraction, penetrating
into every cell of your body,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:90%
or you might not.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Just observe reality
as it actually is.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to make
anything happen or imagine

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:90%
something that is not there.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
If you experience pain,
then observe the pain

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
without resistance,
without complaining,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:90%
without preference.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are
challenging feelings

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
like worry, sadness, anger,
that are present in the body.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are
blissful sensations--

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
joy, peace, love-- or maybe
there's a free flow of energy.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't get attached to anything.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge blissful sensations
as good and painful sensations

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:90%
as bad.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
The practice is to be
equanimous with what is.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
The more you cling to any
sensation, thought, or feeling,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the more energy you send
to the egoic structure,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing more than
a collection of preferences,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
attachments to one
thing or another.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Equanimity is what you're
cultivating, being OK

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
with what is, accepting reality
as it is moment by moment.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Have a complete
experience with whatever

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
is arising, penetrating to
the subtlest sensory level

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
possible, letting
go of any concepts,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
or stories, or
filtering of the mind.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Come to the inner energy
like a baby to its mother,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
surrendered, openhearted,
genuine, innocent.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:90%
This inner energy is love.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.705 align:middle line:84%
You surrender
yourself to this love.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Let it move inside of you.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Let it open you.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Let it circulate,
purify you, rewire you.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of reactions
to pain and pleasure,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
when you let go of
preferences and concepts

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
around the sensations, you
may feel the energy building

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
at any one of the energy
centers in the body.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, you may be
starting to feel a magnetic pull

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
at the third eye
area in the forehead

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and deep inside the head
at the top of the spine

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
in the pineal area, or
maybe in the heart area,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:90%
or in the belly below the navel.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
If you feel a magnetic
pull, let your attention

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:90%
be naturally drawn to that area.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
The attention will
naturally be drawn

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
to areas of increased
energy, increased aliveness.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.320 align:middle line:84%
This aliveness is beyond
pain and pleasure.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
This is not the same as
fixating on a particular pain

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:90%
or pleasure that's arising.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It is choicelessly
letting the mind

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
be drawn to areas of
inner aliveness, which

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
may be experienced as waves,
tingling, bubbles, brightness,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:90%
openings, lightness or fullness.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know what
to do with this inner energy.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing is the entry point
to letting go of egoic control,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
to realizing a level of being
that's beyond the limited mind.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about humbling
the limited self,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:84%
humbling the knower, which
gives entry into the inner world

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.925 align:middle line:90%
into the primordial essence.

00:07:51.925 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to become
completely absorbed

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
into the energy, letting go of
any sense of inner and outer.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the subtle
realm of inner energy

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:90%
is something unfathomable.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of you,
there is a collapse

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
of all duality, a collapse
of inner and outer.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Inner and outer, self and
other, subject and object.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
These are all created
by the limited mind.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
As long as these
dualities exist,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.855 align:middle line:84%
there is an appearance of a
limited me in a separate world.

00:09:13.855 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Notice if your mind is creating
a spatial sense of self.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Are you someone in
a brain looking down

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or is it possible to inhabit the
energy directly as awareness?

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
You can become so intimate
with this field of change

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that you disappear
into it or you

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
could say you wake up as it.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Meditation deepens.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We are actually becoming
aware of the awareness

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that is already inherent within
the sensations of the body.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We are becoming
aware of awareness,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:84%
the awareness that is inherent
within all changing phenomena.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
That presence and that
resonance are not one, not two.
