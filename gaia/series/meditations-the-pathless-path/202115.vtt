00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Bring your attention
to the natural breath,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the pulsation of expansion
and contraction throughout

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You may allow the eyes to
open slightly, gazing softly,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
pointed at the nose, or
the eyes may remain closed.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Observe the sound of
the breath, sensations

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:90%
of air moving at the nostrils.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Allow the aperture
of the mind to open,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
to include the entire body,
feeling the rise and fall

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:90%
of the rib cage, the belly.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Notice when the
body is breathing in

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and when the body
is breathing out.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.435 align:middle line:84%
On the in breath, be aware of
sensations throughout the body.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
On the out breath, be aware of
sensations throughout the body.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Notice every part of the breath.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't miss any phenomena
as the breath reaches

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.665 align:middle line:90%
into every cell of your body.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are
tingling sensations.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is heat or coolness.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is pressure,
tightness or contraction.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's resistance
somewhere in the body.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are
areas where there's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:90%
no sensation in the body.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there's
release, relaxation.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Just notice.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Just observe.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Notice if there's
any emotion present.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
An emotion is a combination
of thought and sensation.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Deeper layers of
thoughts and feelings

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
might start to
come to the surface

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
or intensify as you
go into the body.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Old memories, feelings, anything
that is in the unconscious

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:90%
may come up.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't get caught in any story.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Drop the story.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Become disinterested in any
thoughts that are arising

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and try to open completely
to your experience

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
without resistance.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Be fully aware of the
changing phenomena,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.055 align:middle line:84%
but disinterested in
the meaning or content.

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Let go of the need to
know why certain feelings

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:90%
or sensations are there.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
This is how you become
free of your conditioning.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You stop responding to the
thoughts generated by the mind.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Stop reacting with the mind
while allowing the sensations

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:90%
to arise and pass away.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Over time, the
whirlpool of the mind

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
will start to calm down as
energy or prana is freed

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
from the patterns, so long as
you are no longer interested

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
in the particular
content of the phenomena.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Observe with a beginner's
mind, a not-knowing mind,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:90%
a mirror mind.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
A mirror doesn't
care what is arising.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It simply reflects
reality as it is.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The mirror doesn't
move in response

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:90%
to what is being reflected.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
It is a revelation when
you realize there's

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do in meditation.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:84%
You can relax or surrender
into what is already happening.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.965 align:middle line:84%
No matter what comes up, you
don't have to do anything.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever hindrances
arise in the meditation,

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
we treat them the same way.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Pleasant or unpleasant
itching, tiredness, dullness,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:84%
restlessness, fantasies,
physical pain, emotions,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
memories, bliss, inner
dialogues or narratives,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
images in the mind.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
We allow them to be as they are.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't push them away.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And we stay with the field of
changing sensation in the body.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Keeping awareness at the
root level of sensation.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we have a complete
experience of everything that

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:90%
is arising, but we don't judge.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:90%
We let go of preferences.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't push anything away
and we don't grasp at anything.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Just observe.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Letting the stream of changing
phenomena come and go.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
The more you just observe, the
more of the changing phenomena

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:90%
is allowed to change freely.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The energy is allowed to
circulate in the body,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
moving with its
own intelligence.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Allow the inner
energy, the inner

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
aliveness to move
inside the body.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.155 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to circulate freely.

00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
It is healing energy,
evolutionary energy.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:90%
The energy knows what to do.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to control anything or
micromanage what is happening.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Your only job is to get
yourself out of the way.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Remain aware.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Remain as the unchanging
space in which

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.625 align:middle line:90%
everything arises and passes.

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Rest as the unchanging
awareness within which

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:90%
everything arises and passes.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Rest as the space, this
primordial consciousness that

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.695 align:middle line:90%
has no preference, no agenda.

00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Awareness is not
becoming anything.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It is perfect as it is.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can be added
and nothing can

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:90%
be taken away from awareness.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Rest as awareness, letting the
inner energy circulate freely.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The more you rest
within awareness,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
the deeper unconscious layers
of resistance within the self

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:90%
structure will arise.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And you may find that
greater equanimity

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
will be needed to remain
conscious and present.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The deeper your
surrender to what

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
is, the deeper the purification.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:90%
