00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:04.678
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:14.668
<v ->Stephanie Rearick is an activist</v>

3
00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:16.008
who has taken up the gauntlet

4
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:17.528
for those who are marginalized

5
00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:19.686
by society in any number of ways,

6
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.084
but for the last four years

7
00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:22.304
her involvement has been in

8
00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:24.402
the arena of timebanking.

9
00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:27.102
Based loosely on barter systems of the past,

10
00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:28.440
computer databases,

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.556
and communities based on

12
00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.260
connection with one another

13
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.288
create opportunities for sharing your skills

14
00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:35.716
in a very real and satisfying way.

15
00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.942
<v ->My first activism was with Amnesty International</v>

16
00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:46.920
in college just getting my feet wet, basically,

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.918
and then I worked for Greenpeace for six years,

18
00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:51.298
and then I, also, worked with

19
00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:53.772
a local independent, political party

20
00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:55.872
in Madison called Progressive Dane,

21
00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.272
and chaired the Drug Policy Task Force

22
00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:00.590
viewing drug policy and the War on Drugs

23
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.152
as one of the key issues

24
00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:05.380
in social justice, especially,

25
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.880
playing into the racial disparity

26
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.060
in our prison system,

27
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.852
and our over-incarceration of people,

28
00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:12.412
so those are some of the ways that

29
00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:15.052
I ended up kind of indirectly coming into

30
00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:18.108
working on timebanking and currency issues.

31
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:19.328
<v Voiceover>And all the while, you,</v>

32
00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:21.246
by the way, are a recording artist as well,

33
00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:22.894
so you keep your music

34
00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:24.254
to keep you sane and happy,

35
00:01:24.254 --> 00:01:26.124
and keep your messages rolling.

36
00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.388
What made you realize,

37
00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:33.486
or what was the epiphany for you

38
00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:34.803
that when it comes down to it,

39
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.263
everything keeps flowing back to

40
00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.103
the economics of it all.

41
00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:41.943
<v ->Well, first of all the things that I choose</v>

42
00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:43.901
to do with my life like doing music,

43
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:45.561
and doing music that doesn't necessarily

44
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.400
appeal to masses of people,

45
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.899
but does appeal to people

46
00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.435
who like the music I do.

47
00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:52.075
Doing music I run a small coffeehouse

48
00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:53.855
that's also a music venue,

49
00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.195
and then being politically active.

50
00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.515
All of those things are things

51
00:01:58.515 --> 00:01:59.995
that I think really have value.

52
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.813
People in the community say they have value,

53
00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:03.352
and that they're very important,

54
00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:04.752
but they're all very difficult

55
00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:06.571
to make a living at.

56
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.294
I chose

57
00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:11.304
to live with less money,

58
00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:12.484
and less material goods,

59
00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:14.143
in favor of doing what I want to do,

60
00:02:14.143 --> 00:02:16.559
and I felt free to do that which is partly

61
00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.779
because I grew up in a comfortable situation.

62
00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.398
There are a lot of people

63
00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:23.917
who wouldn't free to do that,

64
00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.157
so there was that,

65
00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:26.757
and then also all the issues

66
00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:27.977
that I was working on,

67
00:02:27.977 --> 00:02:29.897
all of these things have such a common thread

68
00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:32.317
where our money system

69
00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.097
is driving everything

70
00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:35.637
the exact wrong direction.

71
00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:37.037
If you own a small business

72
00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:39.617
you're pressured to continue to expand.

73
00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.777
Small businesses are constantly

74
00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:43.837
eaten up by big businesses,

75
00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.897
and then with music it's very difficult

76
00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:48.416
for people to actually be able

77
00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:49.796
to present their music,

78
00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.513
have the resources to record,

79
00:02:51.513 --> 00:02:53.320
and tour, and things like that.

80
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:55.780
Then with drug policy,

81
00:02:57.071 --> 00:02:59.150
first of all elicit drug markets create

82
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.589
a huge economic incentive

83
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:02.889
for people to participate in

84
00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.188
illicit drug markets.

85
00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.366
Imprisoning people keeps them off

86
00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.306
the unemployment rolls.

87
00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.285
There's a huge economic driver

88
00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:12.683
of the prison industrial complex.

89
00:03:12.683 --> 00:03:14.319
<v Voiceover>Big incentive, yes,</v>

90
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.993
especially since they've been privatized.

91
00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:17.972
<v ->Oh, yes, absolutely.</v>

92
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.128
All the different law enforcement.

93
00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:26.725
Even the human service sector.

94
00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:28.850
There's so much incentive

95
00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:32.739
to be needed in order to continue

96
00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.119
to draw the funding, and keep your job,

97
00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.597
so I just realized the common thread

98
00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:39.977
among all these things is the money system,

99
00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:42.456
and decided to follow the money back

100
00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:43.996
to what money is,

101
00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:45.895
and why does the system work this way,

102
00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:48.355
and why do we accept it?

103
00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:50.315
Why do we allow ourselves to be

104
00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:51.835
enslaved by this system that

105
00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.935
we know has destroyed our communities,

106
00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:55.275
is destroying our communities,

107
00:03:55.275 --> 00:03:56.635
is destroying our planet,

108
00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:59.095
is destroying our inner lives,

109
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:00.975
and destroying our passion,

110
00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:02.735
you know, our ability to do things

111
00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.442
that we're passionate about.

112
00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:06.192
I think we just accept it

113
00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:07.492
because it doesn't occur to us

114
00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:09.552
that it could be any different,

115
00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:11.871
so because of all those things

116
00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:14.827
I started feeling like

117
00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:16.967
we were about to race right off the cliff,

118
00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:18.327
and then I picked up this book

119
00:04:18.327 --> 00:04:20.446
"The Future of Money" by Bernard Lietaer,

120
00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:22.585
and for the first time

121
00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:24.885
I realized there were issues with money,

122
00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:26.125
and I actually helped start

123
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.165
a local currency in Madison back in 1995

124
00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:31.285
on the basic recognition that

125
00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:32.525
we could use more money,

126
00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.385
and use money that circulates locally.

127
00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.065
I had a basic understanding of

128
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:38.365
the fact that interest on money

129
00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:39.745
was part of the problem.

130
00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:41.425
That's part of what widens the gap

131
00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:42.764
between rich and poor,

132
00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:44.282
and that's part of

133
00:04:44.282 --> 00:04:45.861
the fundamental problem with money,

134
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:47.581
so I had that understanding,

135
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:49.092
and then working on Madison Hours

136
00:04:49.092 --> 00:04:50.785
that was very eye-opening

137
00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:53.125
for me to learn how little

138
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.525
I actually understood about

139
00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:57.239
the Federal money system,

140
00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:01.034
but until I picked up the Bernard Lietaer book

141
00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:04.139
I didn't have a clear understanding

142
00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.037
of all the different functions of money,

143
00:05:06.037 --> 00:05:07.377
and the history of money,

144
00:05:07.377 --> 00:05:08.517
and he also presents

145
00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.017
a lot of different models

146
00:05:10.017 --> 00:05:11.457
from different places,

147
00:05:11.457 --> 00:05:13.217
and different times in history,

148
00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:14.834
and that was the first time I really realized,

149
00:05:14.834 --> 00:05:16.494
well, it doesn't have to be this way.

150
00:05:16.494 --> 00:05:19.200
In fact, this is a recent experiment.

151
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.947
I would say, especially,

152
00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:24.502
now that I'm in the timebank,

153
00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:25.964
which we'll talk about more,

154
00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:28.262
is structured as a non-profit organization,

155
00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.802
so I'm constantly having to apply for money,

156
00:05:30.802 --> 00:05:32.472
write proposals, say exactly how

157
00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:33.772
I'm gonna spend the money,

158
00:05:33.772 --> 00:05:36.190
then evaluation, and outcomes.

159
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Voiceover>That's a full-time job.</v>

160
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.261
<v ->Oh, I know, yeah, I mean,</v>

161
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:42.716
that's a whole other realm to get into,

162
00:05:42.716 --> 00:05:45.081
but now that I'm in the world

163
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:46.416
where we have to show outcomes,

164
00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:48.196
and show successes

165
00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:49.615
in order to keep being funded,

166
00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.382
if I were running

167
00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:55.670
the Central Bank Money Experiment,

168
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.670
debt-based money, interest-bearing money,

169
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.307
I would say that we could have

170
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:01.707
decided a long time ago

171
00:06:01.707 --> 00:06:03.147
that experiment has failed.

172
00:06:03.147 --> 00:06:04.425
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

173
00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:06.145
<v ->It's kind of absurd that we haven't</v>

174
00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:07.383
come to that conclusion yet

175
00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:09.802
since this system that we all labor under

176
00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:13.162
has built into it periodic collapses.

177
00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:16.135
It seems like between 10 and 15 years

178
00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:18.174
there is a collapse of some magnitude,

179
00:06:18.174 --> 00:06:20.120
some are greater than others.

180
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.530
That's one of the things that I realized

181
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.950
is this is not set in stone.

182
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.129
It's not given by divine decree.

183
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.448
This is a system that has evolved

184
00:06:31.727 --> 00:06:33.367
through some trial and error,

185
00:06:33.367 --> 00:06:35.307
and it's had some great success.

186
00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:37.947
I'm not knocking the idea entirely

187
00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:40.367
of this debt-based,

188
00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.586
interest-bearing money system.

189
00:06:41.586 --> 00:06:43.406
It helps in certain realms.

190
00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.024
I mean there's some things that

191
00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:47.444
should be competed for on a big scale,

192
00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:49.684
things that involve scarce resources

193
00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:51.740
that need to be a large infrastructure,

194
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.636
but, anyhow,

195
00:06:53.636 --> 00:06:54.976
but just realizing there are

196
00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.196
lots of different models,

197
00:06:56.196 --> 00:06:59.175
and they drive things in different directions.

198
00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:01.781
They apply to different parts of the economy.

199
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.391
They accomplish different

200
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.211
functions in society.

201
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:09.050
It just really helped liberate my thinking,

202
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.908
and consciousness.

203
00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:13.118
It actually gave me hope for the future,

204
00:07:13.118 --> 00:07:15.125
I have to say,

205
00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.045
for the first time since I was adult enough

206
00:07:18.045 --> 00:07:19.523
to understand what was going on in the world.

207
00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:20.388
It was the first time

208
00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:22.998
I actually felt hopeful that we could have

209
00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:24.728
a future at all, and a brighter future.

210
00:07:24.728 --> 00:07:26.012
<v Voiceover>This was after your exposure to</v>

211
00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:26.847
"The Future of Money?"

212
00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.274
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

213
00:07:28.274 --> 00:07:31.052
<v Voiceover>So that really got you rolling.</v>

214
00:07:31.052 --> 00:07:32.951
<v ->It really did, yeah, it really did.</v>

215
00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:34.999
It changed my life, definitely.

216
00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.006
<v Voiceover>Now you mentioned</v>

217
00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:38.486
something about timebanking.

218
00:07:38.486 --> 00:07:41.125
Now there may be a part of your story

219
00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:42.705
between where you are right now,

220
00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.565
and the timebanking.

221
00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.285
If there is, fill us in,

222
00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:48.965
and then I want to go into this timebanking

223
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:51.024
because I'm very fascinated by it.

224
00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:53.364
<v ->So you mean how I arrived at timebanking</v>

225
00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:54.944
as what I wanted to do.

226
00:07:54.944 --> 00:07:56.543
So when I read "The Future of Money"

227
00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:59.463
he described mutual credit systems,

228
00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:01.469
so, essentially, that is

229
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.919
when people want to conduct a transaction

230
00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:08.759
one person gives a credit to the other person,

231
00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.439
and that person then has a credit

232
00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.759
they can use with anybody else

233
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.218
whose participating in the network,

234
00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:14.538
or in the economy.

235
00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:16.198
When I read about that

236
00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:18.554
it was kind of a head slap, like,

237
00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:21.153
"Why haven't we been doing this all along?"

238
00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:22.673
It was very simple and elegant,

239
00:08:22.673 --> 00:08:25.153
and perfect, it just made perfect sense.

240
00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:27.173
Then the timebanking part of it

241
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.973
simplifies it even further

242
00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:31.841
because the unit of exchange is an hour.

243
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:33.651
It's universal.

244
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:36.171
Everyone's hour is valued the same.

245
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:37.468
There's no negotiability.

246
00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:39.688
You don't say my hour is worth $20.

247
00:08:39.688 --> 00:08:41.708
Your hour is worth an hour,

248
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.208
is worth a time dollar,

249
00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:45.544
and everyone exchanges equally.

250
00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:47.124
<v Voiceover>So a lawyer can't say,</v>

251
00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:48.444
an attorney can't say,

252
00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:51.382
"My $225 an hour

253
00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:52.761
"is really worth a lot more than

254
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.141
"your breadmaking hour."

255
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:56.421
<v ->Yes, exactly, no one can do that.</v>

256
00:08:58.057 --> 00:09:01.356
I just realized that that has a capacity

257
00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:04.496
to tap all kinds of untapped potential,

258
00:09:04.496 --> 00:09:06.665
and all kinds of people,

259
00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:09.835
and to just really include people,

260
00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:12.175
and to give people a chance to participate

261
00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:13.675
in something that they don't have to

262
00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:15.995
really stretch to wrap their brain around.

263
00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:18.494
People get the idea of timebanking.

264
00:09:18.494 --> 00:09:20.054
It's intuitive to people.

265
00:09:20.054 --> 00:09:22.141
It goes back to how we

266
00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:25.271
naturally interact as human beings.

267
00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:27.810
It takes us back to how

268
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.650
in the past and a lot of people in the present

269
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.410
work collectively to help each other

270
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.763
in the community,

271
00:09:34.763 --> 00:09:37.542
but it also applies newer technologies,

272
00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:39.702
and thoughts about how you can catalog

273
00:09:39.702 --> 00:09:42.208
the assets, and the needs in a community

274
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.454
just increases using web-based technology,

275
00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:48.376
or other types of technologies.

276
00:09:48.376 --> 00:09:49.534
You can just really increase

277
00:09:49.534 --> 00:09:51.914
the pool of knowledge of what is available

278
00:09:51.914 --> 00:09:53.074
in your community,

279
00:09:53.074 --> 00:09:54.653
so people can get what they need.

280
00:09:54.653 --> 00:09:56.591
For example, running the coffeehouse

281
00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:58.911
that I run I have had the opportunity

282
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:01.411
to do trade and barter with people forever,

283
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:04.380
but then I realized I'm fortunate.

284
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.266
I have a visible commodity

285
00:10:07.266 --> 00:10:08.460
that I have to trade,

286
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.920
and everybody has something

287
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.880
they can exchange.

288
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.276
That should be available to everybody,

289
00:10:12.276 --> 00:10:15.981
so then with information technologies

290
00:10:17.494 --> 00:10:20.011
timebanking can make all that available,

291
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.231
and it doesn't have to be

292
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:23.531
a marketable skill.

293
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:25.329
It can be visiting people that are homebound.

294
00:10:25.329 --> 00:10:26.608
It can be making phone calls

295
00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:27.547
to check in on people,

296
00:10:27.547 --> 00:10:29.027
or invite people to events,

297
00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:30.525
or sharing your music collection,

298
00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:32.245
or you can be fixing a computer,

299
00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:33.685
or providing legal services,

300
00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:36.343
or providing health care, or literacy training.

301
00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:39.902
So it taps all kinds of assets from

302
00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:41.382
the largest to the smallest,

303
00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:43.981
and the smallest I don't mean small,

304
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.641
but I mean least marketable.

305
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:48.140
Those are some of the most important things

306
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.880
that happen in society.

307
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.160
Such as home visits.

308
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.579
Such as checking in on people.

309
00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:54.399
Such as helping a person who's disabled

310
00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.648
get out to do something fun.

311
00:10:56.648 --> 00:10:58.573
Yeah, caring, caregiving.

312
00:10:58.573 --> 00:11:00.717
Civic engagement is a huge one.

313
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.847
This is something I noticed from

314
00:11:02.847 --> 00:11:04.947
being involved in local government issues.

315
00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:07.354
I also used to serve on some city committees.

316
00:11:08.764 --> 00:11:10.224
At that point I realized

317
00:11:10.224 --> 00:11:12.141
while a lot of our city governance

318
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:14.141
is done through volunteer labor,

319
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.599
but who's at the table at those things?

320
00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:20.883
I think volunteering

321
00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:23.173
it's a beautiful thing.

322
00:11:23.173 --> 00:11:24.193
It's a wonderful thing,

323
00:11:24.193 --> 00:11:25.253
and I don't mean to diminish it,

324
00:11:25.253 --> 00:11:27.672
but some people grow up with

325
00:11:27.672 --> 00:11:29.192
the expectation that they'll volunteer

326
00:11:29.192 --> 00:11:31.872
in their leisure the leisure time to volunteer,

327
00:11:31.872 --> 00:11:33.592
and other people don't.

328
00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:37.827
When you're looking at civic engagement,

329
00:11:37.827 --> 00:11:39.564
for example, and city committee work,

330
00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:41.064
and making decisions that are central

331
00:11:41.064 --> 00:11:42.284
to the health of the city

332
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.784
you don't tend to have the people,

333
00:11:43.784 --> 00:11:45.124
you know, you don't tend to have

334
00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:46.444
the people who are lower income,

335
00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:47.462
and the people of color.

336
00:11:47.462 --> 00:11:48.542
The people who are working

337
00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.682
three jobs to meet ends meet

338
00:11:49.682 --> 00:11:51.681
because they simply can't do it,

339
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:54.281
or even if they're available to do it

340
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:55.899
they don't feel empowered to do it.

341
00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:57.339
It doesn't occur to people to do it,

342
00:11:57.339 --> 00:11:59.098
so with timebanking

343
00:11:59.098 --> 00:12:00.538
and with having everybody

344
00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:02.038
catalog their assets,

345
00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:03.518
and say what they can do,

346
00:12:03.518 --> 00:12:04.518
and when they're available

347
00:12:04.518 --> 00:12:05.738
it gives everyone an opportunity

348
00:12:05.738 --> 00:12:07.918
to give what they have,

349
00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:09.378
to give what they can,

350
00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:10.598
and that's one of

351
00:12:10.598 --> 00:12:12.878
the huge powers of timebanking,

352
00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:14.718
and that's one of the things

353
00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:16.498
that has been very eye-opening to me

354
00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:18.276
is just to get to know so many people

355
00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:21.195
who felt so discounted their whole lives,

356
00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:22.755
and then they get an opportunity

357
00:12:22.755 --> 00:12:24.971
to focus on what they're good at,

358
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.088
and share it with other people, and it opens a...

359
00:12:26.088 --> 00:12:27.591
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it might be a housewife.</v>

360
00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:28.882
Yeah, she might be able to make

361
00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:31.481
incredible pies, or something.

362
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:34.321
There's a place in society for a good pie.

363
00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:35.581
<v ->I need to tell you.</v>

364
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:36.854
This is one of my favorite stories.

365
00:12:36.854 --> 00:12:38.374
From the very beginning of the timebank

366
00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:40.954
we had an information meeting at the library,

367
00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.214
and we brought together,

368
00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:43.850
I think, there were probably 20 people there,

369
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.210
and then people just talked about what

370
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.268
they would offer, and what they would need,

371
00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:48.888
and a guy said he would really like

372
00:12:48.888 --> 00:12:51.187
to have someone bake him a pie once a week

373
00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.006
and then just a couple of weeks later

374
00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:54.286
a woman joined,

375
00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:55.424
and I mentioned it to her, and she's like,

376
00:12:55.424 --> 00:12:57.242
"I love pie.

377
00:12:57.242 --> 00:12:59.001
"I want to make a pie,

378
00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:00.921
"and take out a slice for me and my partner."

379
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:03.141
So they started an arrangement,

380
00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:04.740
so she would bake a pie every week,

381
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.960
and take two slices, and give him the rest,

382
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.439
and he would pay time dollars for it.

383
00:13:08.439 --> 00:13:10.368
So those kinds of things.

384
00:13:11.018 --> 00:13:13.798
You would never have that happen, otherwise.

385
00:13:13.798 --> 00:13:14.698
You know what I mean.

386
00:13:14.698 --> 00:13:15.737
It creates a forum for all this

387
00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:17.236
kind of exchange.

388
00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:18.236
<v Voiceover>It's beautiful.</v>

389
00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:19.775
<v ->It builds relationships, it builds community.</v>

390
00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:20.815
People get to know each other

391
00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:22.034
who would never get to know each other.

392
00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:23.434
You're only matched up

393
00:13:23.434 --> 00:13:25.094
based on you offer this,

394
00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:26.794
and the other person requests this.

395
00:13:27.426 --> 00:13:29.124
Another really great early story

396
00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:30.924
was a woman Janet.

397
00:13:30.924 --> 00:13:32.304
She's one of our very first members,

398
00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:33.403
and she's still really active,

399
00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:35.763
and she's absolutely wonderful.

400
00:13:35.763 --> 00:13:38.243
She's about 70, and she had been in

401
00:13:38.243 --> 00:13:39.643
a really tough circumstance

402
00:13:39.643 --> 00:13:41.372
before she joined the timebank.

403
00:13:42.402 --> 00:13:44.162
She wanted to learn to crochet,

404
00:13:44.162 --> 00:13:46.859
and a 15-year-old boy

405
00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.659
taught her to crochet,

406
00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:49.538
which is really sweet.

407
00:13:49.538 --> 00:13:50.618
<v Voiceover>Oh, how cute.</v>

408
00:13:50.618 --> 00:13:51.918
<v ->It's funny because I ended up putting</v>

409
00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:53.518
the anecdote in our brochure,

410
00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:54.557
and then someone who was

411
00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:55.735
proofreading the brochure said,

412
00:13:55.735 --> 00:13:57.135
"Oh yeah, you got this wrong.

413
00:13:57.135 --> 00:13:59.295
"You said, he taught her to crochet."

414
00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:00.732
I thought that was funny that the assumption

415
00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:02.431
was just like, of course, that's not.

416
00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:04.711
<v Voiceover>Right, so this 15-year-old boy</v>

417
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:07.348
his dollars were in

418
00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:09.588
educating her to crochet.

419
00:14:09.588 --> 00:14:11.248
What were her dollars?

420
00:14:11.248 --> 00:14:12.796
The outputted goods?

421
00:14:14.027 --> 00:14:16.103
Her crocheted goods, or?

422
00:14:16.103 --> 00:14:18.961
<v ->No, she has earned time dollars</v>

423
00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:20.960
by helping with child care at events.

424
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.119
That's one of the things she likes to do.

425
00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:23.678
She likes to read to kids.

426
00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:26.857
She helps out on one of the governing bodies

427
00:14:26.857 --> 00:14:29.657
because we ask our members to participate

428
00:14:29.657 --> 00:14:31.437
in running the timebank

429
00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.577
in their neighborhoods,

430
00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:34.236
and they earn time dollars for doing that.

431
00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:35.656
That's part of the civic engagement,

432
00:14:35.656 --> 00:14:37.355
and capacity building that

433
00:14:37.355 --> 00:14:38.815
timebanking is really good for.

434
00:14:38.815 --> 00:14:40.515
Giving people all this experience of doing

435
00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:43.033
what they want to see happen in their community.

436
00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:44.495
So those are some of the ways

437
00:14:44.495 --> 00:14:45.213
that she's earned,

438
00:14:45.213 --> 00:14:46.493
and then she continues to spend

439
00:14:46.493 --> 00:14:48.713
having someone help her clean.

440
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.302
<v Voiceover>So you have to really identify</v>

441
00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:54.769
not only your own skills,

442
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.889
and like you say can be a variety of skills

443
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:59.329
that you can put in.

444
00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:00.969
I mean we're usually,

445
00:15:00.969 --> 00:15:02.949
most human beings are capable of

446
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:04.289
quite a number of things,

447
00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:06.969
so we put those skills into the timebank,

448
00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:08.549
but then you also look at what

449
00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:10.005
the community needs are as well,

450
00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:11.087
so you kind of have to kind of

451
00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:12.927
match community needs,

452
00:15:12.927 --> 00:15:14.965
and there can be more of a saturation

453
00:15:14.965 --> 00:15:16.185
of a certain kind of need

454
00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:17.395
within a community, for example.

455
00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:18.642
<v ->Yes.</v>

456
00:15:18.642 --> 00:15:20.599
<v Voiceover>Okay, so that works,</v>

457
00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:22.999
and this even works in larger systems.

458
00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:25.939
You have what are called co-productions

459
00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:27.359
with this timebank,

460
00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:29.799
and I just love this concept.

461
00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:31.616
Can you give us a couple examples

462
00:15:31.616 --> 00:15:32.856
of these co-productions.

463
00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:36.029
<v ->Yes, so co-production is a philosophy</v>

464
00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:39.354
that says we all are diminished when we

465
00:15:39.354 --> 00:15:41.974
divide society into classes of givers,

466
00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.774
and classes of receivers,

467
00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:45.085
and as I had just mentioned

468
00:15:45.085 --> 00:15:46.605
being involved in this

469
00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:48.865
I see how diminishing it is

470
00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.605
to people who feel like

471
00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:52.785
they're just defined by their needs,

472
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.685
so co-production says that we work together

473
00:15:55.685 --> 00:15:58.565
to create the systems that we need,

474
00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:00.325
or the situation that we need,

475
00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:02.405
and that we're all better off for that.

476
00:16:02.405 --> 00:16:03.325
You're gonna end up with

477
00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:04.762
a stronger system overall

478
00:16:04.762 --> 00:16:06.701
because if the people who need to use

479
00:16:06.701 --> 00:16:08.398
the system are part of designing it

480
00:16:08.398 --> 00:16:10.098
you're gonna be less likely to

481
00:16:10.098 --> 00:16:12.158
leave out key components, for example,

482
00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:13.758
and it's a way to build

483
00:16:13.758 --> 00:16:16.838
partnership in our society, and equality,

484
00:16:16.838 --> 00:16:18.698
and those are some really important

485
00:16:18.698 --> 00:16:20.727
values in timebanking.

486
00:16:23.297 --> 00:16:25.177
I have many examples of co-production,

487
00:16:25.177 --> 00:16:28.316
but one of the examples is

488
00:16:28.316 --> 00:16:30.316
the timebank youth court,

489
00:16:30.316 --> 00:16:32.056
and what that is

490
00:16:32.056 --> 00:16:34.576
is kids between the ages of 12 and 17

491
00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.016
who are getting into trouble.

492
00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:37.554
Generally, they're getting

493
00:16:37.554 --> 00:16:39.192
a municipal ordinance violation

494
00:16:39.192 --> 00:16:41.471
for us in Madison.

495
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:43.051
<v Voiceover>Which is what would be?</v>

496
00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:43.990
<v ->Just a ticket.</v>

497
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.750
Most of them are for fights,

498
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.726
disorderly conduct.

499
00:16:47.726 --> 00:16:49.789
Can be for drug possession.

500
00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:52.208
It can be sometimes

501
00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:54.533
for underage drinking, truancy,

502
00:16:55.462 --> 00:16:56.783
let's see, retail thefts.

503
00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:58.462
<v Voiceover>Kind of normal types of.</v>

504
00:16:58.462 --> 00:16:59.581
<v ->Normal teen stuff.</v>

505
00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:01.001
<v Voiceover>Yeah, teenage mischief stuff.</v>

506
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:02.639
<v ->Vandalism.</v>

507
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.677
So instead of getting a ticket

508
00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:06.517
they get referred to

509
00:17:06.517 --> 00:17:07.777
the timebank youth court,

510
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.697
and they come before a jury of their peers

511
00:17:09.697 --> 00:17:11.435
who've been recruited from the community,

512
00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:12.815
or they go to the same school.

513
00:17:12.815 --> 00:17:14.215
It depends on where it's based.

514
00:17:14.215 --> 00:17:15.729
<v Voiceover>Do they get timebank units for that?</v>

515
00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:18.149
<v ->The jurors earn time dollars for that.</v>

516
00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:20.387
The jurors use their time dollars

517
00:17:20.387 --> 00:17:21.487
for all kinds of things,

518
00:17:21.487 --> 00:17:23.226
but a number of them have gotten computers.

519
00:17:23.226 --> 00:17:24.466
We bring in donated computers,

520
00:17:24.466 --> 00:17:25.726
and make them available.

521
00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:27.466
We had a juror who got a garden plot,

522
00:17:27.466 --> 00:17:29.425
and had a member teach her how to garden.

523
00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:32.185
The jurors learn about restorative justice,

524
00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:34.985
and what happens is

525
00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:36.545
the jurors will ask questions

526
00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:37.705
of the respondent which is

527
00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:39.184
the kid who's gotten in trouble,

528
00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.604
and their parent we encourage to participate.

529
00:17:41.604 --> 00:17:42.364
They don't have to,

530
00:17:42.364 --> 00:17:43.904
but we encourage them to participate.

531
00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:45.824
So they ask questions based on

532
00:17:45.824 --> 00:17:47.064
what happened in the incident,

533
00:17:47.064 --> 00:17:48.504
what's going on in their life,

534
00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:50.023
what they're doing well and at school,

535
00:17:50.023 --> 00:17:51.262
what they're struggling with,

536
00:17:51.262 --> 00:17:52.882
how things are going in the neighborhood.

537
00:17:52.882 --> 00:17:54.022
So they try to get a sense

538
00:17:54.022 --> 00:17:55.482
of what's going wrong

539
00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:56.880
that's getting the kid into trouble,

540
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.420
but they also try to get a sense of

541
00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.920
their strengths and interests,

542
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.840
and then they design a sentence

543
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.780
that ideally is based on both.

544
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.460
So frequently kids will get sentenced

545
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.880
to take a non-violent conflict resolution class.

546
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.120
That's a very common one

547
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.619
for the kids who are getting into fights,

548
00:18:12.619 --> 00:18:15.459
or sometimes they'll get

549
00:18:15.459 --> 00:18:17.819
an alcohol, another drug abuse mentor,

550
00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:20.198
someone who can help them

551
00:18:20.198 --> 00:18:23.047
deal with whatever issues they're dealing with,

552
00:18:23.497 --> 00:18:26.257
but also they'll sentence them

553
00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:27.857
to do something that's based on

554
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.136
what they like to do.

555
00:18:30.136 --> 00:18:32.534
Our goal is to get

556
00:18:32.534 --> 00:18:34.653
as many kids as possible

557
00:18:34.653 --> 00:18:36.593
interested enough in whatever it is

558
00:18:36.593 --> 00:18:38.773
they're doing that they want to stick with it.

559
00:18:38.773 --> 00:18:40.733
<v Voiceover>So, any examples of that?</v>

560
00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:43.293
<v ->Yeah, well, actually, some of the kids</v>

561
00:18:43.293 --> 00:18:44.893
get sentenced to jury duty,

562
00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:46.193
and I think that's one of the most

563
00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:47.432
valuable sentences

564
00:18:47.432 --> 00:18:48.508
when talking about co-production.

565
00:18:48.508 --> 00:18:49.904
The respondents who get

566
00:18:49.904 --> 00:18:50.924
sentenced to jury duty

567
00:18:50.924 --> 00:18:52.303
have such great insights into

568
00:18:52.303 --> 00:18:54.463
what's motivating kids to get in trouble,

569
00:18:54.463 --> 00:18:56.623
and they make some of the best jurors.

570
00:18:56.623 --> 00:18:58.863
A lot of the kids it seems like,

571
00:18:58.863 --> 00:19:01.203
probably, most of the kids who stay active

572
00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:02.743
will do jury duty,

573
00:19:02.743 --> 00:19:04.623
and some of the kids have been on the jury

574
00:19:04.623 --> 00:19:06.862
when they haven't been sentenced to do it.

575
00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:08.622
They just choose to do it.

576
00:19:08.622 --> 00:19:10.622
They don't earn anything

577
00:19:10.622 --> 00:19:11.562
during their sentence,

578
00:19:11.562 --> 00:19:12.862
but once their sentence is done,

579
00:19:12.862 --> 00:19:13.702
or if they do something

580
00:19:13.702 --> 00:19:14.462
on top of their sentence,

581
00:19:14.462 --> 00:19:16.061
then they can get time dollars,

582
00:19:16.061 --> 00:19:18.000
but we have had some families.

583
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.040
We have a couple of really great mentors

584
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.440
who some of the kids will get

585
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.000
sentenced to mentoring sessions,

586
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.476
and we had a family,

587
00:19:24.476 --> 00:19:25.771
where the family joined the timebank,

588
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:27.251
they wanted the rest of the kids

589
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:29.562
to be able to access that mentor.

590
00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:32.485
Actually, we've had a few like that

591
00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:34.365
where they'll join the timebank

592
00:19:34.365 --> 00:19:36.305
to continue taking a class,

593
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:40.511
or just have access to more resources,

594
00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:42.191
so that's part of our goal

595
00:19:42.191 --> 00:19:43.511
is to create a situation where kids

596
00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:45.468
can be in an ongoing basis.

597
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.540
The other ways we use time dollars,

598
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.978
the other way that's integrated

599
00:19:49.978 --> 00:19:51.157
into the youth court

600
00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:53.136
is people who help staff.

601
00:19:53.136 --> 00:19:55.416
The timebank youth court

602
00:19:55.416 --> 00:19:56.995
will earn time dollars for that,

603
00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.494
and then we also have a number of

604
00:19:58.494 --> 00:19:59.654
community members who will

605
00:19:59.654 --> 00:20:01.754
serve as mentors or advocates for the kids,

606
00:20:01.754 --> 00:20:02.893
and earn time dollars for those things.

607
00:20:02.893 --> 00:20:03.539
<v Voiceover>Do you have</v>

608
00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:04.422
law enforcement involved?

609
00:20:04.422 --> 00:20:07.059
<v ->Yes, and that's actually how we started.</v>

610
00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:08.899
We have a wonderful police officer

611
00:20:08.899 --> 00:20:10.336
who just really embraced the concept

612
00:20:10.336 --> 00:20:11.436
right off the bat,

613
00:20:11.436 --> 00:20:12.775
and started helping develop it.

614
00:20:12.775 --> 00:20:15.475
Now our police chief just was signaling us out

615
00:20:15.475 --> 00:20:17.835
for praise at a racial disparity conference

616
00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:19.395
the other day,

617
00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:21.013
and it makes so much sense

618
00:20:21.013 --> 00:20:23.813
because we all know from common sense,

619
00:20:23.813 --> 00:20:25.613
and from all the research

620
00:20:25.613 --> 00:20:27.433
that kids are more likely to get in trouble

621
00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:29.973
if they don't have recreational opportunities,

622
00:20:29.973 --> 00:20:31.633
and economic opportunities,

623
00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:34.273
and a lot of connections in their community,

624
00:20:34.273 --> 00:20:37.393
so building that in, fundamentally,

625
00:20:37.393 --> 00:20:38.846
to the youth court,

626
00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:39.886
building those connections,

627
00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:41.853
and building those opportunities

628
00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:44.323
that's the point.

629
00:20:44.323 --> 00:20:47.042
I'm, frankly, not interested in just creating

630
00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:49.381
another system to get kids into trouble

631
00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:52.201
in a less trouble oriented way.

632
00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:53.321
I want to create a system

633
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:55.441
that really gives kids what they need,

634
00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:57.301
and rebuilds the community around them

635
00:20:57.301 --> 00:20:59.941
to support them,

636
00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:01.660
and support good behavior,

637
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.220
and they're getting to know the other jurors,

638
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.300
and kids in their neighborhood,

639
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.300
and they have people looking out

640
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.396
for their success,

641
00:21:06.396 --> 00:21:07.596
so that's the point.

642
00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:09.516
We're small and we're new,

643
00:21:09.516 --> 00:21:11.235
so I don't want to overstate

644
00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:12.355
the case of our success,

645
00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:15.255
but we're also based on the motto

646
00:21:15.255 --> 00:21:17.235
that's been used in Washington, DC

647
00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:20.312
since the year 2000, I think, or 2001.

648
00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:24.291
They've been seeing

649
00:21:26.089 --> 00:21:27.681
about 1,000 kids a year

650
00:21:27.681 --> 00:21:28.909
have been going through

651
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:30.531
the DC youth court.

652
00:21:31.567 --> 00:21:32.608
It's a great model,

653
00:21:32.608 --> 00:21:34.987
and it's an example of how we use

654
00:21:34.987 --> 00:21:37.867
timebanking as a tool for co-production

655
00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:40.701
to tackle a problem in our community,

656
00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:42.120
and the problem in our community

657
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.900
is racial disparities in the prison system,

658
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.679
and the school-to-prison pipeline,

659
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:49.634
so we are attempting to

660
00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:51.633
disrupt that cycle for good.

661
00:21:51.633 --> 00:21:53.253
<v Voiceover>Yes, wonderful.</v>

662
00:21:53.253 --> 00:21:55.106
<v ->So another one is</v>

663
00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:56.576
there's a beautiful

664
00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:00.646
prisoner re-entry program

665
00:22:00.646 --> 00:22:03.044
that our former board chair,

666
00:22:03.044 --> 00:22:04.643
Cheri Maples has started

667
00:22:04.643 --> 00:22:05.723
with her Buddha Sangha,

668
00:22:05.723 --> 00:22:07.464
and she's now a dharma teacher.

669
00:22:08.414 --> 00:22:10.373
She actually was one of

670
00:22:10.373 --> 00:22:11.914
the candidates for police chief.

671
00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:12.773
She has a long background

672
00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:13.693
in the police department.

673
00:22:13.693 --> 00:22:16.013
She was a captain for more than 20 years.

674
00:22:16.013 --> 00:22:17.553
Now she's retired from that,

675
00:22:17.553 --> 00:22:20.233
and runs a consulting mindfulness,

676
00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:22.433
and social justice firm which is great,

677
00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:25.309
but with her Sangha

678
00:22:25.309 --> 00:22:27.969
has started this coming home project

679
00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:29.409
for people coming out of prison,

680
00:22:29.409 --> 00:22:30.969
and what they are doing is

681
00:22:30.969 --> 00:22:32.849
forming a circle of support around

682
00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:34.389
the person coming out of prison,

683
00:22:34.389 --> 00:22:36.846
and connecting

684
00:22:36.846 --> 00:22:39.645
the returnee with other resources

685
00:22:39.645 --> 00:22:40.665
in the community,

686
00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:42.525
so they can develop some references,

687
00:22:42.525 --> 00:22:43.685
and some trust.

688
00:22:43.685 --> 00:22:44.545
<v Voiceover>This is a big issue</v>

689
00:22:44.545 --> 00:22:45.604
because a lot of times

690
00:22:45.604 --> 00:22:48.103
once that record is there they're unemployable.

691
00:22:48.103 --> 00:22:49.164
<v ->Exactly.</v>

692
00:22:49.164 --> 00:22:50.061
<v Voiceover>Then it just leads them</v>

693
00:22:50.061 --> 00:22:51.219
right back to the same scenarios.

694
00:22:51.219 --> 00:22:52.079
<v ->Exactly, so that's what</v>

695
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.314
we're trying to do is

696
00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:57.112
first of all perform the social support networks,

697
00:22:57.112 --> 00:22:58.287
and the social contacts,

698
00:22:58.287 --> 00:22:59.890
which is probably number one in each of

699
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.567
these things is the number of

700
00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:03.476
social contacts that you have.

701
00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:06.886
Then give people access

702
00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:08.085
to all the resources they need

703
00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:10.384
whether it's rides to job interviews,

704
00:23:10.384 --> 00:23:13.031
or literacy help,

705
00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:16.719
gardening help, help finding housing,

706
00:23:16.719 --> 00:23:18.116
then also give them a chance

707
00:23:18.116 --> 00:23:20.614
to tap into what their strengths and assets are

708
00:23:20.614 --> 00:23:22.294
to develop the work references,

709
00:23:22.294 --> 00:23:24.274
and develop skills if they have skills

710
00:23:24.274 --> 00:23:26.408
that they need to develop,

711
00:23:26.408 --> 00:23:27.793
and some other things that

712
00:23:27.793 --> 00:23:29.613
they're doing around that.

713
00:23:29.613 --> 00:23:30.908
Then they're gonna be teaching

714
00:23:30.908 --> 00:23:33.268
meditation and mindfulness in the prisons,

715
00:23:33.268 --> 00:23:35.068
and non-violent communication

716
00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:36.848
in the prisons,

717
00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:38.108
and then they've linked up with

718
00:23:38.108 --> 00:23:39.548
the humane society,

719
00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:41.628
who recently seized hundreds

720
00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:43.128
of dogs from a puppy mill,

721
00:23:43.128 --> 00:23:44.007
and some of the dogs were

722
00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:46.184
very, very unsocialized.

723
00:23:46.184 --> 00:23:47.921
The humane society,

724
00:23:47.921 --> 00:23:49.445
they did this before

725
00:23:50.038 --> 00:23:51.735
the timebank was part of it,

726
00:23:51.735 --> 00:23:53.435
but the human society placed some of

727
00:23:53.435 --> 00:23:54.635
these dogs with prisoners,

728
00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:56.135
and taught the prisoners

729
00:23:56.135 --> 00:23:57.555
how to socialize the dogs,

730
00:23:57.555 --> 00:23:59.075
and the prisoners built a facility,

731
00:23:59.075 --> 00:24:00.955
so now we put the timebank in there,

732
00:24:00.955 --> 00:24:02.192
so they're gonna get time dollars

733
00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:03.072
for what they're doing,

734
00:24:03.072 --> 00:24:04.512
and then the humane society can use

735
00:24:04.512 --> 00:24:06.752
time dollars for things that they need,

736
00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:08.352
and they'll accept time dollars

737
00:24:08.352 --> 00:24:09.892
for some of their summer camp stuff

738
00:24:09.892 --> 00:24:12.031
that they do for kids.

739
00:24:12.031 --> 00:24:14.310
<v Voiceover>This is wonderful.</v>

740
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.810
<v ->These are all things that people</v>

741
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.910
could be collaborating on anyhow,

742
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.150
without the timebank,

743
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.230
but the timebank is there to facilitate it.

744
00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:24.949
Again, you catalog the assets,

745
00:24:24.949 --> 00:24:26.069
and you catalog the needs

746
00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:27.789
just by having people join and say

747
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:29.549
what they offer and what they need,

748
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:32.128
so the timebank is kind of more like

749
00:24:32.128 --> 00:24:34.568
the information referral system.

750
00:24:34.568 --> 00:24:35.708
It gives you the means of exchange

751
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:37.528
because you can exchange the credits,

752
00:24:37.528 --> 00:24:39.508
but more than that it just shows you

753
00:24:39.508 --> 00:24:41.028
where there are gaps,

754
00:24:41.028 --> 00:24:42.008
and where you can plug in,

755
00:24:42.008 --> 00:24:43.907
and help fill those.

756
00:24:43.907 --> 00:24:45.207
We often say

757
00:24:47.726 --> 00:24:49.086
matching unmet needs

758
00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:50.706
with unused resources.

759
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:52.646
So you're tapping all this capacity,

760
00:24:52.646 --> 00:24:54.186
and building capacity,

761
00:24:54.186 --> 00:24:56.305
working cooperatively to do it.

762
00:24:56.305 --> 00:24:57.865
It just makes a lot of sense.

763
00:24:57.865 --> 00:24:58.805
<v Voiceover>It makes a lot of sense.</v>

764
00:24:58.805 --> 00:25:00.965
Well, how is it going in Madison?

765
00:25:00.965 --> 00:25:01.665
<v ->It's going really well.</v>

766
00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:02.853
<v Voiceover>How many members do you have?</v>

767
00:25:02.853 --> 00:25:04.619
How long has it been going?

768
00:25:06.194 --> 00:25:08.111
<v ->Yesterday was our fourth birthday,</v>

769
00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:09.290
October 20th.

770
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.210
<v Voiceover>Congratulations.</v>

771
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.469
<v ->Thank you, and as of yesterday</v>

772
00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:15.089
we had 1,401 members,

773
00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:17.069
and people had exchanged about

774
00:25:17.069 --> 00:25:19.269
36,000 hours of service,

775
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:20.489
and that's just what's recorded

776
00:25:20.489 --> 00:25:22.269
because people do make exchanges,

777
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:24.548
and choose not to record them which is fine.

778
00:25:24.548 --> 00:25:26.468
Sometimes people make an exchange,

779
00:25:26.468 --> 00:25:28.227
and it feels like it benefits both of them,

780
00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:29.827
and they don't want to record anything,

781
00:25:29.827 --> 00:25:31.947
or people don't get around to it,

782
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:33.284
which all that's fine

783
00:25:33.284 --> 00:25:35.220
because our goal is what's happening

784
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.440
in human society,

785
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.700
it's not about the system itself.

786
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.160
It's about the effect that

787
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.420
it has on people and society.

788
00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.218
At four years, 1,400 members

789
00:25:47.218 --> 00:25:49.645
we're one of the faster growing timebanks.

790
00:25:50.387 --> 00:25:51.695
I think part of that is

791
00:25:51.695 --> 00:25:53.555
because when we initially started

792
00:25:53.555 --> 00:25:55.855
we set out to accomplish several of

793
00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:57.295
the things that we've seen

794
00:25:57.295 --> 00:25:59.195
timebanking do in other places,

795
00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:01.195
so we attempted to really get

796
00:26:01.195 --> 00:26:04.395
a broad variety of skills and interests,

797
00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:06.295
and people represented in the timebank,

798
00:26:06.295 --> 00:26:07.654
so people who would

799
00:26:07.654 --> 00:26:09.654
more naturally form an economy.

800
00:26:09.654 --> 00:26:12.054
You can't just have one set of

801
00:26:12.054 --> 00:26:14.514
assets available in an economy,

802
00:26:14.514 --> 00:26:15.753
and have it flow,

803
00:26:15.753 --> 00:26:17.993
so for us the sectors that

804
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.473
we attempted to connect

805
00:26:20.473 --> 00:26:23.273
are non-profit human service organizations

806
00:26:23.273 --> 00:26:25.411
has been huge, and community centers,

807
00:26:25.411 --> 00:26:27.511
and individuals, and neighborhoods,

808
00:26:27.511 --> 00:26:30.301
and then local food production,

809
00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:32.169
local business to an extent,

810
00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:33.149
and that's something that

811
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:35.536
we expect to build up more in the future,

812
00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:37.664
juvenile and criminal justice.

813
00:26:37.664 --> 00:26:39.224
<v Voiceover>How do you go further into</v>

814
00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:42.284
the goods and services aspect of it,

815
00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:45.214
and involving businesses where it may not be

816
00:26:45.214 --> 00:26:48.150
a literal unit of time

817
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.652
of one hour,

818
00:26:49.652 --> 00:26:52.110
but say you have a local movie theater.

819
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.910
Let's do this, let's say

820
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.710
the economy is more severely damaged,

821
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.129
and there's just very little money

822
00:26:57.129 --> 00:26:58.429
floating around out there

823
00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:01.269
in your community, or any community,

824
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:03.808
and maybe you have a movie theater

825
00:27:03.808 --> 00:27:05.348
owner who's still in business.

826
00:27:05.348 --> 00:27:07.388
How do you start folding in

827
00:27:07.388 --> 00:27:08.828
this kind of scenario?

828
00:27:08.828 --> 00:27:11.206
You've had the ability

829
00:27:11.206 --> 00:27:14.402
to be able to start building this

830
00:27:14.402 --> 00:27:15.982
before some of the really

831
00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:18.450
dire economic consequences have hit.

832
00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:21.220
Once that happens

833
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.189
how does this work from there?

834
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.364
<v ->Well, I'll start with</v>

835
00:27:27.155 --> 00:27:29.675
how it would work in a business situation,

836
00:27:29.675 --> 00:27:32.142
and then probably expand from there.

837
00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:34.919
Right now,

838
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.849
and probably forever,

839
00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:40.509
timebanking is really not designed

840
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:42.769
to go right into a business.

841
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:43.749
You're not gonna take it

842
00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:45.909
in your cash register, generally,

843
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:47.469
and there are many reasons for that.

844
00:27:47.469 --> 00:27:50.049
One is that it doesn't have

845
00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:52.509
a monetary equivalent, and it can't.

846
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:54.889
Another is it has not been recognized

847
00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:56.529
as taxable by the IRS,

848
00:27:56.529 --> 00:27:58.478
and we want to keep it that way

849
00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:00.828
for a number of reasons,

850
00:28:00.828 --> 00:28:03.237
so we are protective of that,

851
00:28:04.647 --> 00:28:07.187
but the way it can work now in a business

852
00:28:07.187 --> 00:28:10.267
is your excess capacity

853
00:28:10.267 --> 00:28:11.884
you make available for time dollars,

854
00:28:11.884 --> 00:28:13.024
and then time dollars

855
00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:15.024
you can use for things that you wouldn't

856
00:28:15.024 --> 00:28:16.564
be able to get otherwise.

857
00:28:16.564 --> 00:28:18.444
When we have businesses join our timebank

858
00:28:18.444 --> 00:28:19.884
they sign off that they wouldn't

859
00:28:19.884 --> 00:28:22.564
replace any paid labor with time dollars.

860
00:28:25.083 --> 00:28:27.363
An example that I give is

861
00:28:27.363 --> 00:28:29.662
if you have a hair salon you could say,

862
00:28:29.662 --> 00:28:31.802
"I'll give one or two haircuts a week,

863
00:28:31.802 --> 00:28:34.502
"or one or two haircuts a month for time dollars."

864
00:28:34.502 --> 00:28:36.142
You charge time dollars based on

865
00:28:36.142 --> 00:28:36.942
the amount of time you spend

866
00:28:36.942 --> 00:28:38.259
cutting the hair,

867
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.114
and then you could use those time dollars

868
00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:42.214
to have someone come,

869
00:28:42.214 --> 00:28:44.009
and do child care for

870
00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:44.968
a certain chunk of time

871
00:28:44.968 --> 00:28:46.307
which might get you some customers

872
00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:48.767
you wouldn't be able to get otherwise,

873
00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:50.487
or you could use those time dollars

874
00:28:50.487 --> 00:28:51.725
to get help with marketing,

875
00:28:51.725 --> 00:28:52.785
or graphic design,

876
00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:53.504
or things that you're having

877
00:28:53.504 --> 00:28:55.704
a hard time affording with money,

878
00:28:55.704 --> 00:28:57.564
so that's how it can work in

879
00:28:57.564 --> 00:28:58.784
a business context,

880
00:28:58.784 --> 00:29:00.904
and does work in a business context now.

881
00:29:00.904 --> 00:29:02.344
<v Voiceover>And that's still, though,</v>

882
00:29:02.344 --> 00:29:03.334
your effort for effort.

883
00:29:03.334 --> 00:29:04.224
<v ->Yes.</v>

884
00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:05.259
<v Voiceover>What happens if you're</v>

885
00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:06.819
spilling over into goods

886
00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:09.158
because there's a shortage of money?

887
00:29:09.158 --> 00:29:11.258
<v ->We do deal with goods somewhat.</v>

888
00:29:11.258 --> 00:29:13.638
Mostly food, which is great,

889
00:29:13.638 --> 00:29:16.118
so people just value it

890
00:29:16.118 --> 00:29:17.718
based on what feels fair,

891
00:29:17.718 --> 00:29:19.998
so right now we have a farmer

892
00:29:19.998 --> 00:29:21.198
whose participating in

893
00:29:21.198 --> 00:29:22.918
the Director of Family Farm Defenders

894
00:29:22.918 --> 00:29:24.437
makes Fair Trade cheese available

895
00:29:24.437 --> 00:29:25.477
for time dollars.

896
00:29:25.477 --> 00:29:27.817
We have people selling eggs from

897
00:29:27.817 --> 00:29:29.137
their chickens that they keep,

898
00:29:29.137 --> 00:29:30.257
and selling extra produce

899
00:29:30.257 --> 00:29:31.877
from their gardens for time dollars,

900
00:29:31.877 --> 00:29:33.037
and people just do it based on

901
00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:35.405
what feels fair for an hour of someone's labor.

902
00:29:36.197 --> 00:29:38.725
It's just negotiable between the two people.

903
00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:43.235
With that I'm gonna mention

904
00:29:43.235 --> 00:29:45.975
a project that we're just starting here

905
00:29:45.975 --> 00:29:48.603
which is what I'm hoping to do,

906
00:29:49.175 --> 00:29:50.750
and working toward,

907
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.199
it's not just hoping.

908
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.150
What we're working toward

909
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.469
is at least exploring

910
00:29:55.469 --> 00:29:57.889
the possibility of creating one system

911
00:29:57.889 --> 00:30:00.584
that would be a timebank and LETS,

912
00:30:00.584 --> 00:30:03.014
which is the Local Exchange Trading System.

913
00:30:04.484 --> 00:30:05.644
LETS operates,

914
00:30:05.644 --> 00:30:07.483
and just because this is a separate interview

915
00:30:07.483 --> 00:30:08.423
I know that you've talked

916
00:30:08.423 --> 00:30:10.620
with other people about that.

917
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.900
They're both mutual credit systems

918
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.980
where you exchange.

919
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.597
I give you a credit for whatever

920
00:30:15.597 --> 00:30:17.677
service or good I'm getting from you.

921
00:30:17.677 --> 00:30:20.757
LETS system is price-based,

922
00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.337
and market-based,

923
00:30:22.337 --> 00:30:24.074
so a LETS system

924
00:30:24.074 --> 00:30:27.234
you can do a business transaction,

925
00:30:27.234 --> 00:30:28.774
so you can come to my business,

926
00:30:28.774 --> 00:30:31.674
and pay for coffee and cookies with

927
00:30:31.674 --> 00:30:34.134
a LETS credit that has a monetary equivalence,

928
00:30:34.134 --> 00:30:36.514
and then I can take that LETS credit,

929
00:30:36.514 --> 00:30:38.814
and use it for getting supplies,

930
00:30:38.814 --> 00:30:40.134
and that's all taxable,

931
00:30:40.134 --> 00:30:41.723
and it's all negotiable.

932
00:30:42.773 --> 00:30:45.033
What I would like to do is have a combination,

933
00:30:45.033 --> 00:30:46.772
so all the information about

934
00:30:46.772 --> 00:30:49.092
offers or requests, assets and needs

935
00:30:49.092 --> 00:30:51.450
is in one database,

936
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.730
and then depending on the type of transaction

937
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.510
it either operates under timebank rules,

938
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.890
or LETS rules,

939
00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.390
and you can exchange it.

940
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.630
You can shift it into the different rules

941
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.310
depending on what you're doing,

942
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.154
and if that happens

943
00:31:07.543 --> 00:31:09.369
then we would also be advocating for policy

944
00:31:09.369 --> 00:31:11.983
to support that for overt tax policies

945
00:31:11.983 --> 00:31:13.762
that protect the timebank part,

946
00:31:13.762 --> 00:31:15.982
and enable goods to be traded

947
00:31:15.982 --> 00:31:17.082
in the timebank,

948
00:31:17.082 --> 00:31:19.214
that what I think should be in timebank rules

949
00:31:19.214 --> 00:31:21.354
is all of the core economy

950
00:31:21.354 --> 00:31:23.392
which is civic engagement, caregiving,

951
00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:24.532
community building,

952
00:31:24.532 --> 00:31:26.712
community organizing, creativity,

953
00:31:26.712 --> 00:31:29.612
and also the basic necessities of life

954
00:31:29.612 --> 00:31:31.552
because that is something

955
00:31:31.552 --> 00:31:33.992
that can be accessible to everybody.

956
00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:37.590
In timebanks people often,

957
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.170
not always, but people often have the ability

958
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.508
to have a greater negative balance

959
00:31:42.508 --> 00:31:43.708
in their account,

960
00:31:43.708 --> 00:31:46.388
so that if you aren't very healthy,

961
00:31:46.388 --> 00:31:48.088
and you need a lot of help,

962
00:31:48.088 --> 00:31:49.288
and you need more help than what

963
00:31:49.288 --> 00:31:50.804
you're gonna be able to provide, that's fine.

964
00:31:50.804 --> 00:31:52.223
That's how we operate in our timebank.

965
00:31:52.223 --> 00:31:53.643
People are happy to support people

966
00:31:53.643 --> 00:31:55.083
who need help,

967
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:56.983
and that's what happens in our society.

968
00:31:56.983 --> 00:31:59.023
People sometimes freak out

969
00:31:59.023 --> 00:32:00.863
at the idea of someone having

970
00:32:00.863 --> 00:32:01.923
a big negative balance.

971
00:32:01.923 --> 00:32:04.103
Well, in our society we do subsidize

972
00:32:04.103 --> 00:32:06.062
the people who aren't able to make it,

973
00:32:06.062 --> 00:32:07.742
only we do it under duress.

974
00:32:07.742 --> 00:32:08.820
In the market economy

975
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.880
people are also complaining about

976
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.320
we tax a market economy to pay people

977
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.660
to go work with people

978
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.300
because they don't have money,

979
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.458
and they don't have access to the market economy.

980
00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:18.978
It's a little bit crazy,

981
00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:21.956
so in this realm

982
00:32:21.956 --> 00:32:24.095
all that stuff would be protected,

983
00:32:24.095 --> 00:32:25.775
everyone's included.

984
00:32:26.672 --> 00:32:28.832
Then in the LETS system

985
00:32:28.832 --> 00:32:31.792
credit worthiness becomes a bigger concern,

986
00:32:31.792 --> 00:32:33.992
and credit limits, and debit limits

987
00:32:33.992 --> 00:32:35.312
become a bigger concern

988
00:32:35.312 --> 00:32:36.148
because you are doing

989
00:32:36.148 --> 00:32:38.065
a market-based situation over there.

990
00:32:38.065 --> 00:32:39.408
It's competitive.

991
00:32:39.408 --> 00:32:42.623
I view it as cooperative and community,

992
00:32:42.623 --> 00:32:45.462
versus competitive in marketplace.

993
00:32:45.462 --> 00:32:47.302
There's nothing wrong with competition,

994
00:32:47.302 --> 00:32:48.522
and you need to have competition

995
00:32:48.522 --> 00:32:50.621
when you're dealing with scarce resources,

996
00:32:50.621 --> 00:32:52.501
but you should not have to compete

997
00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:53.881
with people to meet

998
00:32:53.881 --> 00:32:55.521
the basic necessities of life,

999
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:57.341
or to live a full life as a human being.

1000
00:32:57.341 --> 00:32:58.521
There's no reason to compete

1001
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:00.361
with your neighbors to get piano lessons,

1002
00:33:00.361 --> 00:33:02.941
so all those kind of things.

1003
00:33:02.941 --> 00:33:04.800
So that's what we actually are

1004
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.120
working toward, hopefully,

1005
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.898
is at least exploring the possibility of doing that,

1006
00:33:07.898 --> 00:33:09.200
and it doesn't seem like it needs

1007
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.518
to be too difficult,

1008
00:33:10.518 --> 00:33:13.018
and then we're planning to distill it,

1009
00:33:13.018 --> 00:33:16.016
and to make it work at lots of

1010
00:33:16.016 --> 00:33:17.416
different levels of technology,

1011
00:33:17.416 --> 00:33:18.936
so you could access this system

1012
00:33:18.936 --> 00:33:20.476
via mobile phone

1013
00:33:20.476 --> 00:33:22.056
if that's what people

1014
00:33:22.056 --> 00:33:23.636
are using in your community.

1015
00:33:23.636 --> 00:33:25.956
If you don't have electricity, or Internet access

1016
00:33:25.956 --> 00:33:27.756
you can do it in a paper ledger,

1017
00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:29.235
and maybe once a month

1018
00:33:29.235 --> 00:33:31.793
reconcile it with the database,

1019
00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:33.313
or maybe not even do that,

1020
00:33:33.313 --> 00:33:36.273
so we're interested in creating a kit with tools

1021
00:33:36.273 --> 00:33:39.286
for people to be able to do this locally

1022
00:33:39.286 --> 00:33:41.426
in any kind of setting,

1023
00:33:41.426 --> 00:33:43.165
so it would have the system itself.

1024
00:33:43.165 --> 00:33:44.824
It would also have training tools,

1025
00:33:44.824 --> 00:33:47.744
and tools to create local training,

1026
00:33:47.744 --> 00:33:49.344
and outreach materials.

1027
00:33:49.344 --> 00:33:52.204
It would also have different types of projects

1028
00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:54.464
that you could get as part of your kit.

1029
00:33:54.464 --> 00:33:56.524
For example, starting a garden,

1030
00:33:56.524 --> 00:33:57.884
or starting a youth court,

1031
00:33:57.884 --> 00:34:01.261
or doing weatherization.

1032
00:34:02.261 --> 00:34:04.341
There are a whole lot of different options

1033
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:06.341
that we're exploring right now,

1034
00:34:06.341 --> 00:34:08.759
but a kit so people could learn

1035
00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:10.399
how to do it by doing it,

1036
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.298
and create a project together

1037
00:34:12.298 --> 00:34:13.558
right from the beginning

1038
00:34:13.558 --> 00:34:15.838
develop some community around that.

1039
00:34:15.838 --> 00:34:16.817
We were talking about it,

1040
00:34:16.817 --> 00:34:18.897
so then even if the system fails

1041
00:34:18.897 --> 00:34:20.937
you haven't failed, you've succeeded,

1042
00:34:20.937 --> 00:34:22.157
you've created something

1043
00:34:22.157 --> 00:34:23.156
that's new in your community,

1044
00:34:23.156 --> 00:34:25.996
so that's what we're really working on now

1045
00:34:25.996 --> 00:34:28.295
is really figuring out how we can

1046
00:34:28.295 --> 00:34:30.995
scale this up as quickly as possible,

1047
00:34:30.995 --> 00:34:32.795
and make it available to the people

1048
00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:34.714
who really, really need it.

1049
00:34:34.714 --> 00:34:35.874
The people who are engaged

1050
00:34:35.874 --> 00:34:37.634
in the conversations about money,

1051
00:34:37.634 --> 00:34:39.394
and monetary reform

1052
00:34:39.394 --> 00:34:41.692
tend to be the people who need it

1053
00:34:41.692 --> 00:34:44.031
not necessarily the least.

1054
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:45.797
<v Voiceover>I understand what you're saying, yes.</v>

1055
00:34:49.386 --> 00:34:51.986
<v ->The people who live in abject poverty</v>

1056
00:34:51.986 --> 00:34:53.186
who are already excluded

1057
00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:54.006
from the money system,

1058
00:34:54.006 --> 00:34:55.164
they don't need to talk about it.

1059
00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:56.343
They know it's wrong,

1060
00:34:56.343 --> 00:34:58.042
and they know that

1061
00:34:58.042 --> 00:34:59.642
this relationship is strained,

1062
00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:00.962
this relationship with money,

1063
00:35:00.962 --> 00:35:02.442
so really what we need to do

1064
00:35:02.442 --> 00:35:04.122
is demonstrate how

1065
00:35:04.122 --> 00:35:05.262
we can do things differently,

1066
00:35:05.262 --> 00:35:06.802
and demonstrate that it can be right,

1067
00:35:06.802 --> 00:35:07.902
and give people an opportunity

1068
00:35:07.902 --> 00:35:08.942
to participate in that,

1069
00:35:08.942 --> 00:35:11.082
and people do participate.

1070
00:35:11.082 --> 00:35:14.062
People are very excited to get a chance

1071
00:35:14.062 --> 00:35:16.362
to do something that works,

1072
00:35:16.362 --> 00:35:18.982
and that feels goods,

1073
00:35:18.982 --> 00:35:20.799
and that we're participating as equals,

1074
00:35:20.799 --> 00:35:21.859
and we're co-operating,

1075
00:35:21.859 --> 00:35:24.079
and that's fundamental to it.

1076
00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:27.678
<v Voiceover>So true, that's kind of it.</v>

1077
00:35:27.678 --> 00:35:30.358
That's a summary right there.

1078
00:35:30.358 --> 00:35:32.078
Any other final thoughts you have

1079
00:35:32.078 --> 00:35:33.818
other than what we've already covered?

1080
00:35:33.818 --> 00:35:35.618
<v ->Yeah, there are a couple.</v>

1081
00:35:35.618 --> 00:35:36.717
I did want to mention one other

1082
00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:38.897
co-production example which is

1083
00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:41.637
we have a timebank store in Madison,

1084
00:35:41.637 --> 00:35:43.857
and it's in a neighborhood

1085
00:35:43.857 --> 00:35:46.037
that's very low income,

1086
00:35:46.037 --> 00:35:48.876
and has had a bad reputation,

1087
00:35:48.876 --> 00:35:50.496
although, they've been doing tons of stuff

1088
00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:52.836
to turn their neighborhood around,

1089
00:35:52.836 --> 00:35:54.516
but we started there with

1090
00:35:54.516 --> 00:35:55.476
a timebank store

1091
00:35:55.476 --> 00:35:56.596
because it seemed like a good way

1092
00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:58.276
to get people involved,

1093
00:35:58.276 --> 00:36:00.156
and also fill a need

1094
00:36:00.156 --> 00:36:01.296
because people have a hard time

1095
00:36:01.296 --> 00:36:03.316
obtaining some of the things that they need,

1096
00:36:03.316 --> 00:36:05.916
so we went to St. Louis with

1097
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:07.376
a number of people from the neighborhood,

1098
00:36:07.376 --> 00:36:09.076
and the public health nurse

1099
00:36:09.076 --> 00:36:10.036
who works in the neighborhood.

1100
00:36:10.036 --> 00:36:10.896
We went to St. Louis,

1101
00:36:10.896 --> 00:36:12.776
and visited the timebank stores there

1102
00:36:12.776 --> 00:36:14.176
which was a big relief

1103
00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:16.095
because they're very small scale,

1104
00:36:16.095 --> 00:36:17.735
and seeing them made us realize

1105
00:36:17.735 --> 00:36:20.015
this won't be so hard after all.

1106
00:36:20.015 --> 00:36:22.895
And then the city donated space to us.

1107
00:36:22.895 --> 00:36:24.075
They donated a three-bedroom

1108
00:36:24.075 --> 00:36:25.815
apartment for free,

1109
00:36:25.815 --> 00:36:29.055
and then we collected a lot of donated goods,

1110
00:36:29.055 --> 00:36:31.695
and started a timebank store.

1111
00:36:31.695 --> 00:36:34.695
People in the neighborhood staff it.

1112
00:36:34.695 --> 00:36:36.495
They earn time dollars for staffing it,

1113
00:36:36.495 --> 00:36:39.415
and then people earn their time dollars

1114
00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:41.055
by helping the neighborhood association

1115
00:36:41.055 --> 00:36:42.475
put on community meals.

1116
00:36:42.475 --> 00:36:44.215
They help the Allied Wellness Center

1117
00:36:44.215 --> 00:36:46.015
do their events.

1118
00:36:46.015 --> 00:36:48.535
They help Joining Forces for Families,

1119
00:36:48.535 --> 00:36:50.175
is another organization there,

1120
00:36:50.175 --> 00:36:52.035
and they earn time dollars that way,

1121
00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:54.772
or they go and help with childcare,

1122
00:36:54.772 --> 00:36:56.792
or cleaning for other neighbors.

1123
00:36:56.792 --> 00:36:57.692
Then they can come in,

1124
00:36:57.692 --> 00:37:00.111
and get goods from the store.

1125
00:37:00.111 --> 00:37:02.251
It was really cool when we priced the goods

1126
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:04.048
because I thought that was gonna be difficult,

1127
00:37:04.048 --> 00:37:05.107
but what we do is just brought

1128
00:37:05.107 --> 00:37:06.046
a bunch of really active

1129
00:37:06.046 --> 00:37:07.285
timebank members in,

1130
00:37:07.285 --> 00:37:08.905
and it was just really easy for people

1131
00:37:08.905 --> 00:37:10.644
to look at it and see what felt fair,

1132
00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:12.684
so, for example, you can generally

1133
00:37:12.684 --> 00:37:14.124
get four items of clothing

1134
00:37:14.124 --> 00:37:16.243
for a time dollar which is worth an hour,

1135
00:37:16.243 --> 00:37:18.423
or you can get four toiletries

1136
00:37:18.423 --> 00:37:19.703
for a time dollar.

1137
00:37:19.703 --> 00:37:20.783
You can get a set of dishes

1138
00:37:20.783 --> 00:37:22.863
for a time dollar,

1139
00:37:22.863 --> 00:37:24.343
and then we have computers,

1140
00:37:24.343 --> 00:37:27.543
and TVs, and books, and toys,

1141
00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:30.043
and diapers, and cleaning supplies

1142
00:37:30.043 --> 00:37:31.743
are really in demand,

1143
00:37:31.743 --> 00:37:33.892
and so that's a good way.

1144
00:37:34.763 --> 00:37:37.591
For me that's a good example of how

1145
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:38.881
you can pull a neighborhood together

1146
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:42.036
to figure out a need and fill it,

1147
00:37:42.036 --> 00:37:43.996
and it's been a lot of fun

1148
00:37:43.996 --> 00:37:44.896
to work with people,

1149
00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:47.976
and there's a real sense of ownership of it.

1150
00:37:47.976 --> 00:37:49.016
That's one thing that

1151
00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.096
I love about timebanking

1152
00:37:50.096 --> 00:37:52.954
is it does bring in a lot of different people.

1153
00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:53.894
We have a lot of people with

1154
00:37:53.894 --> 00:37:56.003
developmental disabilities in our timebank.

1155
00:37:56.913 --> 00:37:58.570
That's actually one of our sources,

1156
00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.710
main source of funding right now

1157
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.330
is the County Department of Human Services

1158
00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.110
Developmental Disabilities Budget.

1159
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.269
They give us money

1160
00:38:05.269 --> 00:38:07.389
because they see the timebank

1161
00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:09.168
as being really valuable resources

1162
00:38:09.168 --> 00:38:10.765
for people with disabilities

1163
00:38:10.765 --> 00:38:13.244
who are on the waiting list to receive services,

1164
00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:14.304
or people who are

1165
00:38:14.304 --> 00:38:15.443
already receiving services,

1166
00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:16.823
and everything is being cut.

1167
00:38:16.823 --> 00:38:18.643
You know what they always cut first

1168
00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:20.683
which is understandable,

1169
00:38:20.683 --> 00:38:21.763
although, very sad,

1170
00:38:21.763 --> 00:38:24.083
is the things that make life worth living,

1171
00:38:24.083 --> 00:38:26.843
so you have staff whose

1172
00:38:26.843 --> 00:38:28.243
totally stretched thin.

1173
00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:30.141
They're not taking people out to the movies,

1174
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.200
they're not playing, you know, they're not...

1175
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.973
<v Voiceover>All those amenities are gone.</v>

1176
00:38:33.973 --> 00:38:36.392
<v ->They're relying on their staff for everything,</v>

1177
00:38:36.392 --> 00:38:38.772
so this way not only can they have,

1178
00:38:38.772 --> 00:38:41.430
or a lot of other people are drawn

1179
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.846
to go do fun things with,

1180
00:38:42.846 --> 00:38:44.364
but they're building a lot of relationships

1181
00:38:44.364 --> 00:38:47.364
with people that aren't just their staff.

1182
00:38:48.602 --> 00:38:49.742
We have one guy with

1183
00:38:49.742 --> 00:38:52.260
a developmental disability who

1184
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.560
he pays time dollars to have people

1185
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.699
come play cribbage with him,

1186
00:38:55.699 --> 00:38:56.859
and then he earns time dollars

1187
00:38:56.859 --> 00:38:58.652
teaching people to play cribbage, it's perfect.

1188
00:38:58.652 --> 00:39:00.192
<v Voiceover>How wonderful, that's perfect.</v>

1189
00:39:00.192 --> 00:39:01.892
<v ->Yeah, so it's just a way to</v>

1190
00:39:01.892 --> 00:39:04.212
really include everybody,

1191
00:39:04.212 --> 00:39:05.892
and really include all the activities

1192
00:39:05.892 --> 00:39:07.952
that happen in our economy.

1193
00:39:07.952 --> 00:39:09.012
People think of our economy

1194
00:39:09.012 --> 00:39:10.472
as just the marketplace,

1195
00:39:10.472 --> 00:39:13.652
but the economy is much bigger than that,

1196
00:39:13.652 --> 00:39:15.852
and the core economy is

1197
00:39:15.852 --> 00:39:19.292
a lot of what timebank focuses on

1198
00:39:19.292 --> 00:39:20.992
which is caregiving, civic engagement,

1199
00:39:20.992 --> 00:39:22.412
community building,

1200
00:39:22.412 --> 00:39:24.930
community organizing, creativity.

1201
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.770
Another thing I like to tell people

1202
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.310
when they're joining the timebank is

1203
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.906
we want to help you do more of what you like,

1204
00:39:29.906 --> 00:39:31.266
and less of what you don't like

1205
00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:34.900
because we don't always do that.

1206
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.060
<v Voiceover>Spending eight hours, 12 hours,</v>

1207
00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.620
in some cases 16 hours a day

1208
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.454
just to keep enough cash

1209
00:39:43.454 --> 00:39:45.712
rolling in to survive.

1210
00:39:45.712 --> 00:39:48.672
That is not a civilized way of living.

1211
00:39:48.672 --> 00:39:51.172
<v ->Not at all, and especially when you look at</v>

1212
00:39:51.172 --> 00:39:54.612
the history of the whole situation.

1213
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.130
Automation was sold to people

1214
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.710
based on the idea

1215
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.365
that everyone would have more leisure time,

1216
00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.865
and it continues to go

1217
00:40:02.865 --> 00:40:04.045
the opposite direction.

1218
00:40:04.045 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Voiceover>Absolutely,</v>

1219
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.560
<v ->I mean that's what I think of.</v>

1220
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.336
I think it's really important to realize

1221
00:40:09.336 --> 00:40:11.456
what money is.

1222
00:40:11.456 --> 00:40:14.074
It's a tool, it's an agreement

1223
00:40:14.074 --> 00:40:16.594
for people to be able

1224
00:40:16.594 --> 00:40:18.314
to make exchanges with one another,

1225
00:40:18.314 --> 00:40:20.014
and then when you think about that,

1226
00:40:20.014 --> 00:40:21.454
and look at where we are,

1227
00:40:21.454 --> 00:40:24.094
and how if this amount of human experience,

1228
00:40:24.094 --> 00:40:27.034
and information, and technology

1229
00:40:27.034 --> 00:40:30.134
that we are a slave to our money system

1230
00:40:30.134 --> 00:40:32.214
at the expense of our planet,

1231
00:40:32.214 --> 00:40:34.340
expense of our communities, it's outrageous.

1232
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.710
<v Voiceover>Our relationships with</v>

1233
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.940
our own families.

1234
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.770
<v ->Right.</v>

1235
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.144
<v Voiceover>Right, it is outrageous.</v>

1236
00:40:40.144 --> 00:40:41.911
It has to stop.

1237
00:40:41.911 --> 00:40:44.431
<v ->It has to stop, it has to stop.</v>

1238
00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:46.169
It's gonna stop.

1239
00:40:46.169 --> 00:40:47.349
<v Voiceover>I think so.</v>

1240
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:49.867
<v ->I have a friend who made this great quote.</v>

1241
00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:52.026
He said, "The good news is

1242
00:40:52.026 --> 00:40:54.066
"we'd all be better off with less.

1243
00:40:54.066 --> 00:40:54.984
"The bad news is

1244
00:40:54.984 --> 00:40:56.662
"we're all gonna be better off."

1245
00:40:56.662 --> 00:40:58.498
<v ->Yes.</v>

1246
00:40:58.498 --> 00:41:01.192
On that, thank you so much for your time,

1247
00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:03.619
and for sharing this information,

1248
00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:05.092
and your participation in this.

1249
00:41:05.092 --> 00:41:06.351
I think this is going to be

1250
00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:07.929
greatly inspirational to a lot of people

1251
00:41:07.929 --> 00:41:09.809
to start taking this up

1252
00:41:09.809 --> 00:41:11.189
in their own communities.

1253
00:41:11.189 --> 00:41:13.006
Thanks Stephanie.

1254
00:41:13.006 --> 00:41:15.137
You can go to TimeBanks.org

1255
00:41:15.137 --> 00:41:16.377
to see how timebanking

1256
00:41:16.377 --> 00:41:18.197
might work in your community.

1257
00:41:18.197 --> 00:41:19.737
Outside the U.S. there are also

1258
00:41:19.737 --> 00:41:21.417
a number of timebanking resources.

1259
00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:23.377
Just do a Google search for your region.

1260
00:41:23.377 --> 00:41:25.137
We'll continue our research

1261
00:41:25.137 --> 00:41:27.817
into alternative economic systems next month.

1262
00:41:27.817 --> 00:41:28.797
Until next time,

1263
00:41:28.797 --> 00:41:30.837
thanks for watching CMN.
