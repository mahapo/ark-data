00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
(soft music)

2
00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.377
<v ->What if, like a child, you could simply</v>

3
00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:17.277
call on invisible friends, many call them angels,

4
00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.416
and have them help you with anything you wish

5
00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:20.537
throughout your day?

6
00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:22.987
Sounds silly to some, but not to me.

7
00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:26.496
Jean Slatter, a naturopathic physician by profession,

8
00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:28.555
learned of the magic in this process

9
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:30.496
and has written a wonderful little book titled

10
00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.286
Hiring the Heavens.

11
00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:48.836
Jean, I have to tell you, I love your book.

12
00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:51.295
This is one of the most wonderful little books,

13
00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.656
and for me, because of my own background

14
00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:55.155
over the last 20 or 30 years,

15
00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.296
I've been working with these principles a long time,

16
00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:01.015
but I believe that you have put it in a way

17
00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:04.656
that is not only just accessible to everyone,

18
00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.236
but joyful, and even more so,

19
00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:10.316
allows for a higher degree of effectiveness.

20
00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:12.734
And I say that, because hear of law of attraction,

21
00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.734
the Secret, all these things have been out there,

22
00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:16.155
but I think that what you've done

23
00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:18.334
is actually much more effective than these,

24
00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:20.615
and you may have heard that from other people.

25
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.335
Why might this be the case?

26
00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:23.435
<v ->Oh, well, thank you, Regina.</v>

27
00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.134
You know, I didn't even know

28
00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:28.455
about the law of attraction when I started writing

29
00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.874
Hiring the Heavens.

30
00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:32.155
It was my developmental editor

31
00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.174
that told me about Abraham-Hicks,

32
00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:37.235
and I started learning more about the law of attraction,

33
00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.215
and as the years have gone by,

34
00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:43.355
I began to see how different Hiring the Heavens is

35
00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.752
from the law of attraction.

36
00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:47.672
And I really want to bring that out to people,

37
00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:50.052
because I believe it's time

38
00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:53.631
that we know more about another law,

39
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:55.252
which I call the law of grace.

40
00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:57.131
And it's like two different classrooms.

41
00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:58.512
You can have a classroom

42
00:01:58.512 --> 00:01:59.991
where you learn mathematics

43
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:01.932
and you can have a classroom where you learn English.

44
00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:03.731
One doesn't negate the other,

45
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.531
but they are definitely two different subjects.

46
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:08.811
There's the subject of the law of attraction

47
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.691
and then there's the subject of the law of grace,

48
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.292
and what Hiring the Heavens does

49
00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:17.531
is very gently move you into the law of grace,

50
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:19.708
and here's the difference, okay?

51
00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:20.329
<v Regina>Mmm hmm.</v>

52
00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.388
<v ->With the law of attraction,</v>

53
00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:25.488
it requires so much hypervigilance.

54
00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:27.348
You have to do it right.

55
00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:29.989
You have to be,

56
00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.689
have enough emotion in your asking,

57
00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.305
you have to--

58
00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:33.944
<v Regina>Clarity.</v>

59
00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:34.865
<v ->Clarity!</v>

60
00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:37.485
You have to, I don't use the word "want,"

61
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:39.644
because that gives you more of wanting,

62
00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.424
and stated in the present tense,

63
00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:42.260
and make sure you have enough

64
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.061
attitude of gratitude, and the list goes on and on,

65
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.480
and it makes you become very hypervigiliant.

66
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.441
With this idea of Hiring the Heavens

67
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:54.401
and the law of grace, you'll soon see

68
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:56.401
that none of that is required.

69
00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:00.268
As a matter of fact, there's nothing you can do,

70
00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:01.898
and that's the operative word here.

71
00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:05.138
There's nothing you can do to earn this gift.

72
00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:07.838
This gift is given to you by grace

73
00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:12.238
and it doesn't require any amount of time in prayer,

74
00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:14.537
any amount of time in meditation.

75
00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:17.198
It doesn't require that you ask it just right.

76
00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:20.678
It doesn't require that you have an attitude of gratitude.

77
00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:23.658
None of those things are requirements at all.

78
00:03:23.658 --> 00:03:25.518
In fact, there's nothing you can do to earn it

79
00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:27.178
and there's nothing that you can do

80
00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:28.817
to have it taken away from you.

81
00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:30.658
It's a gift of grace.

82
00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:33.737
And this is really important because

83
00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:36.137
I know that there are many clients I've worked with,

84
00:03:36.137 --> 00:03:38.677
and I'm sure that you've worked with, as well,

85
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:41.827
who have some very dire circumstances

86
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:44.087
and sad circumstances

87
00:03:44.087 --> 00:03:45.808
where there may have been abuse

88
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.049
or something that would, you know,

89
00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.921
bring tears to your eyes,

90
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.358
because their circumstances are that sad.

91
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.897
<v Regina>And the confidence isn't there anymore.</v>

92
00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:58.615
<v ->You're right, and then the idea,</v>

93
00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:00.714
as in law of attraction, that hey,

94
00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:02.115
you created it all,

95
00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:04.875
is just salt in the wound.

96
00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:08.754
And it's a bitter pill that, at that time,

97
00:04:08.754 --> 00:04:10.474
that person just cannot handle.

98
00:04:10.474 --> 00:04:12.115
<v Regina>Because it's more disempowering</v>

99
00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:12.994
to the situation.

100
00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:14.135
<v ->It really is.</v>

101
00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:14.735
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:17.975
<v ->What Hiring the Heavens does, in a very light way,</v>

103
00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:20.294
say that grace is open to you,

104
00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:21.854
no matter who you are,

105
00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:22.955
no matter what you've done,

106
00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:24.095
no matter where you've been,

107
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.374
no matter what your circumstances are,

108
00:04:26.374 --> 00:04:27.895
grace is open to you.

109
00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:30.394
And furthermore, there isn't anything

110
00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:33.695
you're gonna have to do to make this work.

111
00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:35.994
This is a gift to you.

112
00:04:35.994 --> 00:04:37.094
Period.

113
00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:38.774
<v Regina>And when you're talking about Hiring the Heavens,</v>

114
00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:40.315
and that's beautifully put, by the way,

115
00:04:40.315 --> 00:04:42.655
and from having read your book,

116
00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:45.995
I feel quite an accurate thing to say,

117
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.130
when you're looking at this,

118
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.311
you're talking about essentially

119
00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:51.330
getting the guiding forces that are surrounding

120
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.010
all of us all the time and employing them,

121
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.471
bringing them into your life,

122
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:58.370
and specifically being very specific and fun

123
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.740
about it, in the sense that if you need

124
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.270
something done, something specific done,

125
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.750
call in a being, call in an angel, as you call it,

126
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.457
that has that particular skill set,

127
00:05:10.457 --> 00:05:13.397
and essentially allow yourself to be downloaded

128
00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:15.797
with this knowledge or whatnot or ability

129
00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:19.447
or even have it come into your life in another way

130
00:05:19.447 --> 00:05:20.478
from the outside.

131
00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:22.734
And maybe talk about the premise of it.

132
00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:24.294
<v ->Yeah, it's so simple.</v>

133
00:05:24.294 --> 00:05:28.895
I just ask my readers to imagine

134
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.035
that the spiritual world is every bit as complex

135
00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.010
as our own physical plane,

136
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.530
and that on the physical level we have

137
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.870
personality traits, skills, abilities,

138
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.031
everything that you can imagine,

139
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:46.671
every kind of talent available on the physical plane.

140
00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:49.171
Well, imagine that all of that exists first

141
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:50.791
on the spiritual plane.

142
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.811
And so whatever it is that you're doing,

143
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.410
I invite my readers to first

144
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.130
hire from the heavenly resource pool,

145
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.991
so they can pull in a spiritual contractor,

146
00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:04.150
or pull in a spiritual speech therapist,

147
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.491
or pull in a spiritual attitude adjuster,

148
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:08.850
or a money manager.

149
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.411
Whatever it is that you could imagine hiring

150
00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:14.151
first on the physical plane,

151
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.011
hire from the heavenly resource pool.

152
00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:18.831
And amazing things begin to happen

153
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.951
when you call up on this power of the universe

154
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:26.030
that really is accessible to each and every one of us.

155
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.170
Some amazing things begin to happen.

156
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.230
One, you can have that inspiration

157
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.970
come right through you.

158
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.850
So you can have, if you need some information,

159
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.331
you can ask to be inspired with the information you need,

160
00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:43.786
and it'll come right through you.

161
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.706
And I've had that happen so many times

162
00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:48.207
when I need to work with a client

163
00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.926
in my business as a naturopath

164
00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:51.507
and I need to know what to do,

165
00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:52.847
the information just comes through,

166
00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:55.887
sometimes things that I've never even heard of before.

167
00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:58.687
Another thing that can happen is that

168
00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:00.766
the heavens will bring to you

169
00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:02.687
someone that will help you

170
00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:05.046
with whatever it is that you're requiring.

171
00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:07.386
That happened to me when I was writing my book,

172
00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:08.927
Hiring the Heavens.

173
00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:11.866
The first time I got the message to write the book

174
00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:13.846
I thought, "I don't know what to do here.

175
00:07:13.846 --> 00:07:15.507
"I'm a first-time author.

176
00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:16.966
"How do I even begin?

177
00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:18.087
"You're gonna have to help me out."

178
00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:21.307
So I hired a spiritual book writing committee

179
00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.026
and I said, "Bring me somebody that's gonna

180
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.027
"help me develop these ideas."

181
00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.706
No kidding, I come home

182
00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:29.346
and there's a message on my recorder

183
00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:31.186
from a complete stranger, said,

184
00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:32.667
"Hello, my name is so-and-so,

185
00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:35.866
"and I'm a developmental editor.

186
00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:37.206
"Just wondering if you had any projects

187
00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.047
"you were working on."

188
00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:38.827
(Regina laughs)

189
00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:41.326
So I knew she was heaven sent.

190
00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:43.007
And the same thing happened

191
00:07:43.007 --> 00:07:46.366
when it got to the point where I needed to

192
00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:50.125
take my manuscript and do the final editing.

193
00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:51.826
And this is the point where I said,

194
00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.626
"Okay, I need somebody that's gonna be able

195
00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:56.226
to cross all the Ts and dot all the Is.

196
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.566
Bring me somebody that will help me do that."

197
00:07:58.566 --> 00:07:59.885
And the very next day

198
00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:01.765
I had a brand new client at my office

199
00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:03.786
that had very tiny handwriting,

200
00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:06.066
which means to me that they--

201
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:06.686
<v Regina>Meticulous.</v>

202
00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.526
<v ->Yeah, meticulous.</v>

203
00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:09.046
So I said, "What is that you do?"

204
00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:11.146
And she says, "Oh, I'm a copy editor."

205
00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:12.486
And I says, "What's a copy editor?"

206
00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.606
And she says, "Oh, we make sure

207
00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:15.686
"that all the Ts are crossed and all the Is are dotted."

208
00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:18.006
So I said, "Oh, well you're supposed to work for me."

209
00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:20.265
So that's what happens.

210
00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:23.726
The heavens bring someone to your doorstep,

211
00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:26.166
and truly they are heaven sent.

212
00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:27.806
You know, there's no question about that.

213
00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:29.726
And the third thing that can happen

214
00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:32.066
when you hire from this heavenly resource pool,

215
00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:35.765
is you'll watch a flat out miracle happen.

216
00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.945
And my gosh, I have got so many stories

217
00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:43.025
of absolute miracles occurring

218
00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:46.736
when people call upon the heavens.

219
00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:49.765
I know there's a story in my book that,

220
00:08:49.765 --> 00:08:52.925
it's my favorite story, I tell it over and over,

221
00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:56.505
and that is of my friend,

222
00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:59.665
who hired a spiritual jewelry sleuth, and--

223
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:00.624
<v Regina>Jewelry sleuth?</v>

224
00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:01.724
She'd lost jewelry.

225
00:09:01.724 --> 00:09:04.705
<v ->Yeah, what happened was she had been out</v>

226
00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:07.904
pruning in her yard, and this yard was huge,

227
00:09:07.904 --> 00:09:12.684
so when she came in, she was taking a drink of water.

228
00:09:12.684 --> 00:09:16.284
Her daughter noticed that an irregular-shaped pearl

229
00:09:16.284 --> 00:09:18.024
in her ring that her husband had given her

230
00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.063
many years ago, was missing,

231
00:09:20.063 --> 00:09:21.683
and her heart immediately sank.

232
00:09:21.683 --> 00:09:23.284
She knew there was no way

233
00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:25.523
she was going to find this tiny little pearl

234
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:30.084
out in a huge yard where she had been pruning that day.

235
00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:33.264
So she knew it was gone.

236
00:09:33.264 --> 00:09:36.643
And then something inspired her

237
00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:39.224
to think about hiring the heavens.

238
00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:41.800
So she imagined hiring

239
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.640
a spiritual jewelry sleuth to,

240
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.299
and I love what she said, she said,

241
00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:49.600
"Find my pearl and bring it to me."

242
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Regina>Which is, that's a very bold--</v>

243
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.379
<v ->It is!</v>

244
00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:54.540
I mean, yeah, to me that's miraculous.

245
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.980
So, an hour later, she is sitting on the bed,

246
00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.600
talking to her kids,

247
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.000
and the dog jumps up on the bed.

248
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.640
And her son says,

249
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.879
"Mom, Callie is playing with something in her mouth."

250
00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:07.240
And she said, "Drop it, Callie."

251
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.315
And the dog dropped the pearl

252
00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:12.755
right in front of her hand.

253
00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:14.496
<v Regina>I love that story.</v>

254
00:10:14.496 --> 00:10:15.536
Actually, I'm glad you brought it up,

255
00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:16.835
because I had written that down.

256
00:10:16.835 --> 00:10:17.936
I wanted you to share that.

257
00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:19.955
It's just, because that's one of those things,

258
00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:21.216
you can't make this stuff up.

259
00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:22.092
<v ->No you can't!</v>

260
00:10:22.092 --> 00:10:22.342
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

261
00:10:22.342 --> 00:10:23.140
<v ->No you can't!</v>

262
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.256
<v Regina>And there are a lot more like it.</v>

263
00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:26.895
And, I mean, you call this

264
00:10:26.895 --> 00:10:29.615
resource your universal Yellow Pages,

265
00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:31.095
and you speak about the fact

266
00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.415
that we have all these angels that are unemployed

267
00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:35.696
and just waiting to serve us.

268
00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:38.415
And actually, if you read the work

269
00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:41.475
of other individuals that I've interviewed,

270
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:44.936
this is not at all out of the realm of thinking.

271
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.555
And in fact even with my own guidance,

272
00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:49.395
they've said repeatedly, "Why don't you use us more?

273
00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.795
"There are so many beings on this side

274
00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:53.836
"that are here, basically in agreement

275
00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:56.715
"to work with humanity and no one calls on them."

276
00:10:56.715 --> 00:10:58.216
So when you say unemployed angels,

277
00:10:58.216 --> 00:11:00.095
that really struck me as truth.

278
00:11:00.095 --> 00:11:00.755
<v ->Oh, my gosh.</v>

279
00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:03.575
You know, I have a friend that called me up

280
00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:07.215
to tell me what happened for her.

281
00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.156
She's clairvoyant, and I'm not,

282
00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:12.495
so I haven't actually seen these angels at work.

283
00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:15.076
I certainly have evidence of it.

284
00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:17.315
But this lady is clairvoyant

285
00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:18.536
and she has worked with the angels

286
00:11:18.536 --> 00:11:20.476
ever since she was very young.

287
00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:24.836
And after reading my book,

288
00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.816
it brought on a whole new dimension

289
00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:28.695
that she had never thought about.

290
00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:31.176
Most of us, including her,

291
00:11:31.176 --> 00:11:32.495
had only called upon the angels

292
00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:33.976
when it was a big ticket item.

293
00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:34.885
<v Regina>Yeah, that's right.</v>

294
00:11:34.885 --> 00:11:36.018
<v ->When it was something, you're in crisis,</v>

295
00:11:36.018 --> 00:11:38.075
or there's something really important,

296
00:11:38.075 --> 00:11:40.715
or we actually come up with things

297
00:11:40.715 --> 00:11:42.575
that we can justify--

298
00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:44.434
<v Regina>Right, as thinking we're somehow</v>

299
00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:47.775
using up our chits or wasting energies or something.

300
00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:48.794
<v ->Yeah, right, right.</v>

301
00:11:48.794 --> 00:11:50.795
So what Hiring the Heavens does, though,

302
00:11:50.795 --> 00:11:52.475
is encourage people to call upon the heavens

303
00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:53.894
for everything in their life,

304
00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:56.375
no matter how big, or no matter how small.

305
00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:59.095
So after reading my book, that night,

306
00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:00.755
that's exactly what she did.

307
00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:03.134
She wrote down committee page

308
00:12:03.134 --> 00:12:06.094
after committee page, hiring from the heavens

309
00:12:06.094 --> 00:12:07.175
for everything in her life.

310
00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:10.024
She had a committee for her

311
00:12:10.024 --> 00:12:11.995
relationship with her husband.

312
00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.454
She had a committee for her children.

313
00:12:13.454 --> 00:12:15.034
She had a committee for her work.

314
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:18.175
She had a committee for her life's joy and passion.

315
00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:20.575
She left no stone unturned,

316
00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:22.025
hiring away from the heavens

317
00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:25.894
everyone and every position she could possibly think of.

318
00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:29.535
Well that night, she fell asleep exhausted.

319
00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:30.875
The next morning when she woke up,

320
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.615
because she was clairvoyant,

321
00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:34.955
she said she opened her eyes, looked around,

322
00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.474
and couldn't believe what she was seeing.

323
00:12:37.474 --> 00:12:38.614
<v Regina>So many beings!</v>

324
00:12:38.614 --> 00:12:40.634
<v ->She said they were everywhere!</v>

325
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:41.654
Everywhere!

326
00:12:41.654 --> 00:12:43.655
That there was so much commotion going on

327
00:12:43.655 --> 00:12:46.415
and there were even some coming up to her,

328
00:12:46.415 --> 00:12:48.734
saying, "We heard you were hiring.

329
00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.554
"Have you got a job for us?"

330
00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:53.395
And they were showing her, like, a resume.

331
00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:55.754
Showing her what they were good at.

332
00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:59.255
<v Regina>Oh, that is just heartwarming.</v>

333
00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:00.375
That is beautiful.

334
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.314
And in fact, along that line

335
00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:05.695
I have a close girlfriend who does this,

336
00:13:05.695 --> 00:13:08.034
and she has been doing this her entire life.

337
00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:12.215
She just puts her helpers into action

338
00:13:12.215 --> 00:13:14.275
every single day and just manifests

339
00:13:14.275 --> 00:13:17.274
the most amazing life and opportunities.

340
00:13:17.274 --> 00:13:19.095
She wants a new client in a certain country,

341
00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:20.854
she'll have a call within 48 hours

342
00:13:20.854 --> 00:13:22.235
for a new client in that country,

343
00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:24.495
so she can fly there on the business.

344
00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:27.415
I mean, the point is it works.

345
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:30.974
But let's talk about more of these kinds of anecdotes.

346
00:13:30.974 --> 00:13:32.095
I love those.

347
00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:34.612
It's heartwarming to hear other people's experiences

348
00:13:34.612 --> 00:13:36.531
and another one that I fell in love with in your book

349
00:13:36.531 --> 00:13:38.592
was a little fellow named Logan

350
00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:40.092
who had book report to do

351
00:13:40.092 --> 00:13:42.692
and he really, really wanted to do it on Joe Montana.

352
00:13:42.692 --> 00:13:43.792
Tell us that story.

353
00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:46.551
<v ->You know, he was so upset</v>

354
00:13:46.551 --> 00:13:49.451
because all the books at the school library

355
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.411
bad been checked out.

356
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:53.012
And they must have been talking about Joe Montana

357
00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:55.471
'cause all the boys wanted to do a story

358
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.052
on Joe Montana and they got in there

359
00:13:57.052 --> 00:13:58.132
and grabbed all the books

360
00:13:58.132 --> 00:13:59.971
and there wasn't anything left for him.

361
00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.231
So when he came home from school that day,

362
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:04.471
told his mom, you know,

363
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:06.132
"I've gotta get a book on Joe Montana."

364
00:14:06.132 --> 00:14:06.848
She says, "Don't worry,

365
00:14:06.848 --> 00:14:09.429
"we'll take you to the city library,"

366
00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:10.869
which she did do.

367
00:14:10.869 --> 00:14:13.929
Now, she was outside playing with the younger daughter

368
00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:15.989
for about an hour while her son

369
00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:19.709
was inside looking for a book on Joe Montana.

370
00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:22.829
He came back after an hour so frustrated

371
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.228
that he was almost crying.

372
00:14:24.228 --> 00:14:26.909
He said, "Mom, all the books on Joe Montana

373
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:28.548
"have been checked out.

374
00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:30.429
"What am I gonna do?"

375
00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:31.629
She says, "You know what?

376
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:32.309
"I've got an idea.

377
00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:34.629
"Why don't you go back in and try one more time."

378
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:36.928
And he says, "I've already looked!"

379
00:14:36.928 --> 00:14:38.278
And she says, "No, no.

380
00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:40.729
"Go back in and look one more time."

381
00:14:40.729 --> 00:14:43.028
So as he turned to walk back in,

382
00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:45.628
she hired a spiritual homework assistant

383
00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:49.849
to go with him and help him find a book on Joe Montana.

384
00:14:49.849 --> 00:14:51.829
Well, three minutes later,

385
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:53.789
she walked in behind him

386
00:14:53.789 --> 00:14:57.949
and here he is standing in the checkout line

387
00:14:57.949 --> 00:15:01.969
with a book that was 18 by 12

388
00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:04.369
with the word "Montana" across the top

389
00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:05.988
and a picture of Joe.

390
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.548
You know, it was, like, perfect.

391
00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:09.788
She says, "Oh my gosh, this is the perfect book.

392
00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:11.309
"How did you find this?"

393
00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:12.949
And he said, "Well."

394
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:14.268
He actually took her over to the side.

395
00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:17.649
"Mom, it was kind of spooky.

396
00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:21.989
"I went to the sports section where I looked before,

397
00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:23.249
"and I thought to myself,

398
00:15:23.249 --> 00:15:26.708
"what if a book fell behind the shelves?

399
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:30.788
"So I stuck my head in between the bookshelves

400
00:15:30.788 --> 00:15:35.368
"and there's this book on in, and I pulled it up,

401
00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:36.083
"and here it is."

402
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:36.983
<v Regina>Joe Montana.</v>

403
00:15:36.983 --> 00:15:37.978
<v ->Joe Montana.</v>

404
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:38.778
(Regina chuckles)

405
00:15:38.778 --> 00:15:41.679
Okay, now that story, as you read, is in my book,

406
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:44.719
but let me tell you the ending to that story,

407
00:15:44.719 --> 00:15:46.138
which I didn't put in the book

408
00:15:46.138 --> 00:15:48.379
because I thought, you know,

409
00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:51.399
okay, the stories that I write about are miraculous.

410
00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.679
They really are miracles.

411
00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:56.938
But sometimes when we're placed where the miracle

412
00:15:56.938 --> 00:16:00.639
is in front of us, we sometimes discount it

413
00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:02.238
if it just goes over the top.

414
00:16:02.238 --> 00:16:03.358
Well, this one does.

415
00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:05.219
Here's the real ending.

416
00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:08.816
That book wasn't in

417
00:16:08.816 --> 00:16:11.476
the library's computer system.

418
00:16:11.476 --> 00:16:12.156
<v Regina>Really?</v>

419
00:16:12.156 --> 00:16:16.987
<v ->That book was simply manifested for that little boy.</v>

420
00:16:17.534 --> 00:16:18.090
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

421
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.330
<v ->Is that a miracle or what?</v>

422
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.070
<v Regina>Yeah, that falls in that category, definitely.</v>

423
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.051
<v ->Yeah but these kinds of things happen.</v>

424
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.710
When you hire from the heavens,

425
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.750
miracles do happen,

426
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.610
and it's we who tend to put limits

427
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.430
on what can possibly happen.

428
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Regina>That is true.</v>

429
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.090
<v ->We're the ones that say,</v>

430
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.410
"Well, you know, I can accept this but not that.

431
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.050
"That would just be too much for my mind to handle."

432
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.530
But really, from the spiritual world, it's easy.

433
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.370
<v Regina>It's true, and even if you cross this over</v>

434
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.030
with some of the more avant garde work

435
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.990
in the area of quantum physics,

436
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.850
they will say the exact same thing.

437
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.570
If your mind can conceive of it,

438
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.730
you can create that, you can manifest that.

439
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.510
And so, what's beautiful about the way you do it

440
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.090
is it makes it easy for people,

441
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.670
it gives people permission to conceive

442
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.750
of what it is they truly desire

443
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.050
and ask for the help they need.

444
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:11.630
<v ->That's right.</v>

445
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.170
<v Regina>And in this book, now how do people feel?</v>

446
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.211
I mean, you must have people

447
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:16.670
from different religious backgrounds

448
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.670
and spiritual beliefs that are reading it.

449
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.830
Do you ever get any comment?

450
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.070
Does it go against anyone's belief system?

451
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.610
Or is it fairy well accepted across the board

452
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.490
because of the way it's written?

453
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.570
<v ->You know, I haven't had much of a problem</v>

454
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:35.270
with that at all because most people believe in angels

455
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.186
and the fact that angels could be here

456
00:17:38.186 --> 00:17:41.726
to assist us kinda gives us an easy way

457
00:17:41.726 --> 00:17:44.846
to not bother the big guy, you know?

458
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:46.906
It's like, I say you're not gonna bother the big guy

459
00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:49.486
for finding the perfect hair color,

460
00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:53.446
but you can hire a spiritual hair dresser

461
00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:55.426
to help you find the perfect hair color

462
00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:57.986
and then that seems okay to do.

463
00:17:57.986 --> 00:18:01.666
And so it kind of takes away some of the edge

464
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:05.876
of when we think about praying to God,

465
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:10.001
most of us come with a bit of trepidation.

466
00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:11.121
<v Regina>Like you say,</v>

467
00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:13.543
save it for the big ones, right?

468
00:18:13.543 --> 00:18:15.341
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

469
00:18:15.341 --> 00:18:17.249
But we can tone it down a little bit

470
00:18:17.249 --> 00:18:19.630
and open it up by just hiring away

471
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.290
from the entire spiritual resource pool

472
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.269
for all sorts of things, you know?

473
00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:27.849
And it doesn't even matter if you can think

474
00:18:27.849 --> 00:18:31.090
of a name to call this person.

475
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.390
You can make it up.

476
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.330
Some of the most imaginative things

477
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.391
that I've heard from people just put a smile on my face.

478
00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:40.250
One time I was giving a presentation

479
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.851
at a group back east

480
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:44.350
and there was a gentleman there in the audience

481
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.091
that said, "You're speaking again tomorrow morning, yes?"

482
00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:48.349
And I said, "Yeah."

483
00:18:48.349 --> 00:18:50.429
And he says, "I just love what you've had to say

484
00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.869
"so I want to come tomorrow morning, too."

485
00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:56.609
Well, the next morning, as I'm giving my presentation,

486
00:18:56.609 --> 00:19:00.629
I noticed about 45 minutes into my presentation,

487
00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:03.989
in walks this gentleman from the back of the room.

488
00:19:03.989 --> 00:19:07.749
Well, after my presentation, he came up to me

489
00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:10.929
and he said, "You know, I gotta tell you what happened."

490
00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:14.829
He said, "I actually have been camping out

491
00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:18.369
"during this conference and my tent is cold.

492
00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:21.349
"I'm sleeping on this hard mat

493
00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:22.810
"and it's just been miserable.

494
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.069
"I haven't been getting a good night's sleep.

495
00:19:25.069 --> 00:19:28.669
"So after hearing your talk, what I did

496
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:31.309
"is I hired a spiritual tent warmer

497
00:19:31.309 --> 00:19:34.369
"to keep my tent nice and warm last night

498
00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:37.909
"and I hired a spiritual mattress maker.

499
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:40.909
"And I said, 'Make my pad feel like

500
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:43.449
"'my 2,000 dollar bed at home.'

501
00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:46.249
"Well, I'm late because I overslept!

502
00:19:46.249 --> 00:19:48.389
"I had such a good night's sleep, you know,

503
00:19:48.389 --> 00:19:49.389
"I was so comfortable!"

504
00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:51.389
So that's an example

505
00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:54.009
where you can just have fun with this.

506
00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:57.229
You don't have to say it in a particular way.

507
00:19:57.229 --> 00:20:00.049
You don't have to say just the right words.

508
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:01.830
You can just make it up.

509
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.409
<v Regina>Yes, and the thing is desire is key here.</v>

510
00:20:04.409 --> 00:20:06.749
A lot of people, especially depending

511
00:20:06.749 --> 00:20:11.269
on certain of the religious and spiritual belief systems,

512
00:20:11.269 --> 00:20:14.009
there's a belief that we're to rid ourselves of desire.

513
00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:17.809
But in reality, it is that, whatever you want to call

514
00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:20.887
the field that is created through desire,

515
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.607
that draws forth the result.

516
00:20:23.607 --> 00:20:26.727
You have to have, it's dead if there's not desire.

517
00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:28.347
You can do law of attraction all day long

518
00:20:28.347 --> 00:20:30.267
and look at your pictures on your board

519
00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:32.427
that you've created, but if you don't have

520
00:20:32.427 --> 00:20:35.747
that warmth and that joy and that desire

521
00:20:35.747 --> 00:20:37.987
behind that image that you're looking at,

522
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.467
it still doesn't happen.

523
00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:42.147
<v ->That's right, and that was one of the most profound</v>

524
00:20:42.147 --> 00:20:44.927
messages as I was writing Hiring the Heavens.

525
00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:48.228
And by the way, it's a very well-written book

526
00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:51.168
because it was written by--

527
00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:52.787
<v Regina>It is, it's very succinct, it's short</v>

528
00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:54.746
and it's to the point and well done.

529
00:20:54.746 --> 00:20:55.846
<v ->Short, sweet, and it was written</v>

530
00:20:55.846 --> 00:20:58.506
by my heavenly committee, you know?

531
00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:03.146
So I was learning, as I was putting these words on paper,

532
00:21:03.146 --> 00:21:05.104
I was learning so much.

533
00:21:05.104 --> 00:21:07.904
And one of the things that I have in italics

534
00:21:07.904 --> 00:21:09.144
in my book in the very beginning

535
00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:13.502
is that by divine design, we are creators.

536
00:21:13.502 --> 00:21:14.423
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

537
00:21:14.423 --> 00:21:18.882
<v ->And I didn't know that prior to writing this book</v>

538
00:21:18.882 --> 00:21:22.162
and as a matter of fact, that whole idea

539
00:21:22.162 --> 00:21:25.022
really has been brought home to me

540
00:21:25.022 --> 00:21:26.722
as the years have gone by.

541
00:21:26.722 --> 00:21:29.542
We are creators, by divine design.

542
00:21:29.542 --> 00:21:32.082
That's who we are, that's what we're here to do.

543
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:34.703
Well how can you create if you don't have a desire?

544
00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:37.282
How can you create if you don't have a want?

545
00:21:37.282 --> 00:21:39.202
<v Regina>How can you create if you don't believe you can?</v>

546
00:21:39.202 --> 00:21:41.122
<v ->Yeah, that's the seed.</v>

547
00:21:41.122 --> 00:21:44.422
That's what you absolutely have to have

548
00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:46.862
to get energy to move.

549
00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:47.502
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

550
00:21:47.502 --> 00:21:50.442
In fact, you write in one chapter,

551
00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:53.678
talking about the potential of

552
00:21:53.678 --> 00:21:55.678
conflicting belief systems,

553
00:21:55.678 --> 00:21:58.378
and you're saying some might find it blasphemous

554
00:21:58.378 --> 00:22:01.418
to say that you have the right,

555
00:22:01.418 --> 00:22:04.098
you have the right and obligation to yourself to do this.

556
00:22:04.098 --> 00:22:05.738
And you wrote something, this line here,

557
00:22:05.738 --> 00:22:08.218
I wrote it down because I thought it was so perfect.

558
00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:12.818
You said that the blasphemy lies only in our rejection

559
00:22:12.818 --> 00:22:15.218
of this innate power within ourselves.

560
00:22:15.218 --> 00:22:15.958
<v ->Right.</v>

561
00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.638
<v Regina>Now that's a powerful statement.</v>

562
00:22:17.638 --> 00:22:21.168
Very true, beautifully put.

563
00:22:21.168 --> 00:22:25.818
<v ->We talk about that we have this,</v>

564
00:22:25.818 --> 00:22:27.439
the God within.

565
00:22:27.439 --> 00:22:30.658
We talk about that, and most religions do.

566
00:22:30.658 --> 00:22:34.058
And yet, then in the next statement,

567
00:22:34.058 --> 00:22:36.898
we want to somehow separate ourselves from it

568
00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:39.798
and say that we have to call upon it

569
00:22:39.798 --> 00:22:42.198
from outside of us.

570
00:22:42.198 --> 00:22:42.818
<v Regina>Right.</v>

571
00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:45.418
<v ->And that somehow we have to even able</v>

572
00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:48.356
to justify our use of it.

573
00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:51.016
And that's the blasphemy, you know?

574
00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:53.616
This is a gift that, going back to the grace,

575
00:22:53.616 --> 00:22:56.136
this is a gift to you, by grace.

576
00:22:56.136 --> 00:22:59.476
It's like the air that you breathe.

577
00:22:59.476 --> 00:23:04.036
And it is yours because you exist.

578
00:23:04.036 --> 00:23:06.416
It is yours because you're alive.

579
00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:10.056
This gift via creator, and this energy,

580
00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:13.956
this power within you, is yours simply because you exist.

581
00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:17.456
And there really isn't anything you have to do

582
00:23:17.456 --> 00:23:19.896
to earn it or justify it.

583
00:23:19.896 --> 00:23:23.076
You know, if I'm in a bad attitude

584
00:23:23.076 --> 00:23:25.176
and I'm whiny and complainy,

585
00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:26.896
do I still get to breathe?

586
00:23:26.896 --> 00:23:27.596
I still do, and--

587
00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:29.456
<v Regina>As you say, it's the grace</v>

588
00:23:29.456 --> 00:23:31.036
of the human experience.

589
00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:34.136
It's not all just sledging through life

590
00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:37.116
trying to figure out and do our lessons properly.

591
00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:40.576
This is the countervailing force that makes life a joy

592
00:23:40.576 --> 00:23:43.476
and allows us to create the circumstance we wish.

593
00:23:43.476 --> 00:23:46.796
<v ->And that is what I know that the</v>

594
00:23:46.796 --> 00:23:48.656
heavens rejoices in.

595
00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:51.256
People talk about when your hiring the heavens,

596
00:23:51.256 --> 00:23:54.336
it assumes there's a payment of some sort,

597
00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:58.376
and there is, in our joy.

598
00:23:58.376 --> 00:24:01.616
And the more the joy that we have,

599
00:24:01.616 --> 00:24:05.277
the more lightness in our voice,

600
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.156
the more skip in our step,

601
00:24:08.156 --> 00:24:10.856
more fun we have creating.

602
00:24:10.856 --> 00:24:12.896
That's our payment.

603
00:24:12.896 --> 00:24:14.756
That's what we give in return.

604
00:24:14.756 --> 00:24:17.516
And, you know, we can all afford that.

605
00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.636
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

606
00:24:18.636 --> 00:24:20.896
We can't afford not to have that, really.

607
00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:22.756
Not if we want to have the kind of life

608
00:24:22.756 --> 00:24:24.976
that we all dream of.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

609
00:24:24.976 --> 00:24:26.217
<v Regina>We have to create that.</v>

610
00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:26.956
<v ->Yeah.</v>

611
00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:28.076
<v Regina>And one of the things,</v>

612
00:24:28.076 --> 00:24:30.476
you go on to talk about some of the specifics

613
00:24:30.476 --> 00:24:32.916
when you're using these simple principles

614
00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:37.057
and one of them is using your physical voice.

615
00:24:37.057 --> 00:24:38.356
Let's talk about that for a minute,

616
00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:39.396
versus just thinking.

617
00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:41.236
Now, obviously if you're in a crowded place

618
00:24:41.236 --> 00:24:43.016
you'll use your inside voice.

619
00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:44.436
But let's talk about what happens

620
00:24:44.436 --> 00:24:47.176
when you put this in the form of the physical voice.

621
00:24:47.176 --> 00:24:51.796
<v ->I always to talk to my spiritual staff aloud,</v>

622
00:24:51.796 --> 00:24:53.996
and usually I do this in the car.

623
00:24:53.996 --> 00:24:55.756
You don't have to have a special setting

624
00:24:55.756 --> 00:24:58.616
or, you know, do a certain amount of meditation

625
00:24:58.616 --> 00:24:59.376
ahead of time.

626
00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:02.016
Talk to your spiritual hires just as if

627
00:25:02.016 --> 00:25:03.336
you were talking to your best friends,

628
00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:05.636
because they really are.

629
00:25:05.636 --> 00:25:07.376
And so throughout the day,

630
00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:09.796
I'll be carrying on my conversation

631
00:25:09.796 --> 00:25:13.396
as I'm doing dishes, as I'm, you know, doing my hair,

632
00:25:13.396 --> 00:25:15.276
or when I'm driving in the car,

633
00:25:15.276 --> 00:25:17.316
I'm talking to my spiritual hires

634
00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:19.756
just as if they were sitting right next to me.

635
00:25:19.756 --> 00:25:23.256
And by talking out loud, I think that it helps me

636
00:25:23.256 --> 00:25:26.216
be more clear about what it is that I'm asking.

637
00:25:26.216 --> 00:25:28.076
Not that you have to have all your Ps and Qs

638
00:25:28.076 --> 00:25:30.136
all lined up and all of that.

639
00:25:30.136 --> 00:25:33.081
You can be working it out as you're talking,

640
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:33.981
but the point is--

641
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:35.221
<v Regina>They can also sense your intent.</v>

642
00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:36.481
They know the intention behind it.

643
00:25:36.481 --> 00:25:38.161
<v ->They know your intention, so as you say,</v>

644
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:38.981
if you're in a crowded room,

645
00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:40.721
you don't have to speak out loud,

646
00:25:40.721 --> 00:25:43.721
but by speaking out loud, it helps you to be more clear

647
00:25:43.721 --> 00:25:45.381
and helps you kind of figure it out.

648
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:46.881
Like, I'll be talking along and say,

649
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:47.799
"Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

650
00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:49.319
"That's not right.

651
00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:50.579
"Let's try this."

652
00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:54.299
And, you know, just say it in a different way.

653
00:25:54.299 --> 00:25:58.359
Or sometimes, you know, it's just really fun

654
00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:02.278
to express yourself

655
00:26:02.278 --> 00:26:04.038
with a lot of emotions.

656
00:26:04.038 --> 00:26:06.078
Sometimes I sing to them.

657
00:26:06.078 --> 00:26:09.938
I laugh, I make jokes and laugh at myself, you know?

658
00:26:09.938 --> 00:26:13.138
And I feel like they really enjoy--

659
00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.278
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

660
00:26:14.278 --> 00:26:16.758
<v ->Partaking in my levity.</v>

661
00:26:16.758 --> 00:26:18.238
And, you know, just make it

662
00:26:18.238 --> 00:26:20.838
something that is fun to do.

663
00:26:20.838 --> 00:26:23.518
<v Regina>Now you also talk about want versus desire.</v>

664
00:26:23.518 --> 00:26:25.938
Wanna articulate that one?

665
00:26:25.938 --> 00:26:28.038
<v ->Well, when I started getting into</v>

666
00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:31.318
some of the New Age material out there,

667
00:26:31.318 --> 00:26:34.698
which, by the way, came after writing this book--

668
00:26:34.698 --> 00:26:36.158
<v Regina>Right, this was written in 2002.</v>

669
00:26:36.158 --> 00:26:37.138
Just to put that out there.

670
00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:38.178
<v ->Right, yeah, yeah.</v>

671
00:26:38.178 --> 00:26:41.218
You know, some of the things I started reading then,

672
00:26:41.218 --> 00:26:44.998
I started having anxiety about how I said things

673
00:26:44.998 --> 00:26:47.238
when I would be hiring from the heavens.

674
00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:48.898
Like, if I used the word "want,"

675
00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:51.078
I was told don't use that word "want,"

676
00:26:51.078 --> 00:26:54.359
because that puts you in a perpetual state of wanting.

677
00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:55.158
<v Regina>Oh right, this is what</v>

678
00:26:55.158 --> 00:26:56.318
we were talking about earlier, right.

679
00:26:56.318 --> 00:26:58.838
<v ->Yeah, yeah, and all of a sudden, you know,</v>

680
00:26:58.838 --> 00:27:03.419
it just started creating anxiety with me

681
00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:07.298
that I had to say things just right.

682
00:27:07.298 --> 00:27:10.098
Well, so I went through a period of time

683
00:27:10.098 --> 00:27:13.058
of kind of working that out, and then I realized,

684
00:27:13.058 --> 00:27:16.078
oh, just let all of that go,

685
00:27:16.078 --> 00:27:18.418
and just talk to them

686
00:27:18.418 --> 00:27:19.438
like you're talking to your best friend.

687
00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:24.158
Even if you wanna talk and complain about something.

688
00:27:24.158 --> 00:27:25.818
Even that's okay.

689
00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:28.918
You know, some of my most miraculous things

690
00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:30.918
have happened when I've been

691
00:27:30.918 --> 00:27:34.456
in a tough pickle

692
00:27:34.456 --> 00:27:37.136
and I feel like I'm almost pleading

693
00:27:37.136 --> 00:27:39.936
and begging, "Oh, please do something here!"

694
00:27:39.936 --> 00:27:42.016
You know, "Get me out of this mess!"

695
00:27:42.016 --> 00:27:45.496
And extraordinary things will happen.

696
00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:48.456
And, you know, that's not stating things

697
00:27:48.456 --> 00:27:51.796
in the present tense, as if I already have it.

698
00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:54.896
(laughing)

699
00:27:54.896 --> 00:27:56.750
<v Regina>It's a very desperate plea.</v>

700
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.590
<v ->Yeah, it is a desperate plea.</v>

701
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.370
And it's very human.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

702
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.470
<v ->Very human.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

703
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.170
<v ->And you know what?</v>

704
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.730
They don't expect anything else from us.

705
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:04.410
<v Regina>Right.</v>

706
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.670
<v ->They just want us to be real with them</v>

707
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.470
and that's about as real as you can get.

708
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.370
<v Regina>And then we go to another area,</v>

709
00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.010
which I think is very important,

710
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.010
and that's gratitude.

711
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.910
Let's talk about the role of gratitude in this mix.

712
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:16.851
<v ->In this mix,</v>

713
00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:19.050
and I think I'm so glad you brought that up,

714
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.610
because in,

715
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.050
I'm gonna talk about these two different schools now,

716
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.750
or two different classrooms.

717
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.881
In the law of attraction,

718
00:28:27.881 --> 00:28:32.690
you need to have an attitude of gratitude

719
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.584
to actually bring things to fruition.

720
00:28:36.584 --> 00:28:41.044
But in this idea of hiring the heavens,

721
00:28:41.044 --> 00:28:44.344
an attitude of gratitude is actually,

722
00:28:44.344 --> 00:28:48.024
it's a byproduct of living this way.

723
00:28:48.024 --> 00:28:50.057
It's not a prerequisite.

724
00:28:50.057 --> 00:28:52.636
So it isn't something that you have to do ahead of time

725
00:28:52.636 --> 00:28:53.997
and make sure, okay, I'm checking in.

726
00:28:53.997 --> 00:28:55.616
Am I in enough gratitude here?

727
00:28:55.616 --> 00:28:56.756
It's not about that.

728
00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:59.936
What happens is, as a result of living this way

729
00:28:59.936 --> 00:29:02.296
and a result of living in grace,

730
00:29:02.296 --> 00:29:04.256
the byproduct is gratitude.

731
00:29:04.256 --> 00:29:05.856
You can't help it!

732
00:29:05.856 --> 00:29:08.676
You can't help but have this huge, joyous

733
00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:10.196
smile on your face.

734
00:29:10.196 --> 00:29:12.236
You can't help but be grateful

735
00:29:12.236 --> 00:29:14.416
for everything that shows up in your life.

736
00:29:14.416 --> 00:29:16.236
It's quite magical, really.

737
00:29:16.236 --> 00:29:19.936
I was listening to a program by Deepak Chopra

738
00:29:19.936 --> 00:29:21.636
called Synchrodestiny,

739
00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:25.616
and in this program, he says there are

740
00:29:25.616 --> 00:29:28.616
two symptoms of enlightenment

741
00:29:28.616 --> 00:29:31.356
according to ancient Vedic tradition,

742
00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:33.496
and when I first was hearing him, I thought,

743
00:29:33.496 --> 00:29:35.776
"Okay, I know what those two symptoms must be.

744
00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:38.336
"Must be that you have so much love in your heart

745
00:29:38.336 --> 00:29:40.276
"that you cease all judgment.

746
00:29:40.276 --> 00:29:43.156
"Surely those are symptoms of enlightenment."

747
00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:45.296
But I was wrong.

748
00:29:45.296 --> 00:29:49.816
The two symptoms of enlightenment are number one,

749
00:29:49.816 --> 00:29:53.376
synchronicities are happening to you as a daily occurrence.

750
00:29:53.376 --> 00:29:56.736
You ask for something, and there it is.

751
00:29:56.736 --> 00:30:00.296
And the other symptom is, is because of that

752
00:30:00.296 --> 00:30:02.096
you just don't have any worries anymore.

753
00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:06.806
You just know everything's being taken care of.

754
00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:08.036
<v Regina>That is perfect.</v>

755
00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:09.716
<v ->Coincidentally I was working,</v>

756
00:30:09.716 --> 00:30:11.356
I was giving another presentation,

757
00:30:11.356 --> 00:30:13.576
there was a gentleman that came up to me

758
00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:15.116
and he says, "I gotta tell you, Jean,

759
00:30:15.116 --> 00:30:16.836
"I heard you speak about a year ago

760
00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:18.636
"and what you said changed my life."

761
00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:22.216
And I said, "Wow, what an amazing thing to say!

762
00:30:22.216 --> 00:30:24.276
"In what way did it change your life?"

763
00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:27.556
So he looked down and he got very quiet for a minute

764
00:30:27.556 --> 00:30:29.636
and he said, "You know, I'm not going to be able

765
00:30:29.636 --> 00:30:33.036
"to tell you some fantastic miracle story,

766
00:30:33.036 --> 00:30:36.736
"but what I can tell you is that as a result

767
00:30:36.736 --> 00:30:38.456
"of Hiring the Heavens,

768
00:30:38.456 --> 00:30:40.556
"synchronicities are always happening to me.

769
00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:42.436
"It seems like whatever I need, I ask for

770
00:30:42.436 --> 00:30:44.256
"and there it is.

771
00:30:44.256 --> 00:30:46.936
"And I just don't worry about anything anymore

772
00:30:46.936 --> 00:30:50.337
"because I just know everything's being taken care of."

773
00:30:50.337 --> 00:30:51.116
<v Regina>Perfect.</v>

774
00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:53.476
<v ->That is where the gratitude come from.</v>

775
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:56.556
When you're living from that place of grace,

776
00:30:56.556 --> 00:30:57.656
how can you help--

777
00:30:57.656 --> 00:30:58.456
<v Regina>Help it.</v>

778
00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:00.616
Exactly, how could you not be grateful?

779
00:31:00.616 --> 00:31:01.356
<v ->Exactly.</v>

780
00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:04.534
<v Regina>And having, just a personal note,</v>

781
00:31:04.534 --> 00:31:06.534
having experienced a good amount

782
00:31:06.534 --> 00:31:08.494
of synchronicity within my life,

783
00:31:08.494 --> 00:31:13.174
but also in terms of calling on my guides,

784
00:31:13.174 --> 00:31:15.428
I call them guides, but I like the idea

785
00:31:15.428 --> 00:31:17.188
of just having your angel express card,

786
00:31:17.188 --> 00:31:18.548
I think that's cool.

787
00:31:18.548 --> 00:31:20.388
If I need something, I hate shopping,

788
00:31:20.388 --> 00:31:21.789
and if I need something,

789
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:23.448
I just wanna know where it is.

790
00:31:23.448 --> 00:31:25.888
I wanna go and get it and have it done with

791
00:31:25.888 --> 00:31:27.828
and not have to look around

792
00:31:27.828 --> 00:31:31.208
and comparison shop and all those really tedious things.

793
00:31:31.208 --> 00:31:33.108
And it's amazing.

794
00:31:33.108 --> 00:31:37.858
What happens is I have to take care of this thing,

795
00:31:37.858 --> 00:31:40.773
a picture of the storefront shows in my head,

796
00:31:40.773 --> 00:31:42.291
I'll think, "Oh, maybe they don't even,

797
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:44.411
"I didn't even know they carried such items,"

798
00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:46.209
and I'll go in and oftentimes it'll even be

799
00:31:46.209 --> 00:31:48.049
the last one left, and on sale.

800
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.649
<v ->Oh, yes!</v>

801
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:50.889
<v Regina>It's almost in, not 100%,</v>

802
00:31:50.889 --> 00:31:52.089
but almost infallible.

803
00:31:52.089 --> 00:31:55.089
The only reason it would be fallible

804
00:31:55.089 --> 00:31:57.129
is if I allowed my mind to interfere and say,

805
00:31:57.129 --> 00:32:00.129
"No, they don't have, stock such things."

806
00:32:00.129 --> 00:32:01.729
But as long as I just go with the pictures,

807
00:32:01.729 --> 00:32:02.709
it's always right there.

808
00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:04.169
And that's just one fun little way

809
00:32:04.169 --> 00:32:06.349
in which I work with mine.

810
00:32:06.349 --> 00:32:07.429
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

811
00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:10.449
You never wanna go shopping without

812
00:32:10.449 --> 00:32:12.929
your shopping angels.

813
00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:13.829
A few years ago,

814
00:32:13.829 --> 00:32:17.109
when my daughter was still in grade school,

815
00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:18.427
it was Halloween

816
00:32:18.427 --> 00:32:21.767
and I waited until the night before

817
00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:24.607
to think about getting her a Halloween costume.

818
00:32:24.607 --> 00:32:26.047
And then the parade is the next day,

819
00:32:26.047 --> 00:32:27.627
so of course there's a lot pressure.

820
00:32:27.627 --> 00:32:29.747
You gotta get out their Halloween costumes.

821
00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:33.527
So as we're driving down the road,

822
00:32:33.527 --> 00:32:35.427
I said to her, I said, "Okay, honey.

823
00:32:35.427 --> 00:32:38.207
"Let's hire a spiritual Halloween costume designer

824
00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:40.947
"to help us go to the exact place we need to do

825
00:32:40.947 --> 00:32:42.807
"and find the costume that you want."

826
00:32:42.807 --> 00:32:45.487
And she wanted to be a diva singer.

827
00:32:45.487 --> 00:32:48.067
Well, in the past what we had done

828
00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:51.287
is we had gone to used clothing stores

829
00:32:51.287 --> 00:32:53.247
and we'd kinda try to mix and match something

830
00:32:53.247 --> 00:32:56.087
and I'd go home and I'd sew it up, okay?

831
00:32:56.087 --> 00:32:59.587
Well, we arrive at this used clothing store

832
00:32:59.587 --> 00:33:01.247
where I'd purchased before,

833
00:33:01.247 --> 00:33:04.567
just as they're locking the doors.

834
00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:05.487
My daughter is like,

835
00:33:05.487 --> 00:33:06.707
"Mom, what am I gonna do?

836
00:33:06.707 --> 00:33:07.867
"The parade is tomorrow!"

837
00:33:07.867 --> 00:33:09.667
And I said, "Well, don't worry, honey.

838
00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:12.127
"We have our spiritual Halloween costume designer

839
00:33:12.127 --> 00:33:14.947
"with us, so where do we need to go?"

840
00:33:14.947 --> 00:33:16.147
And I kinda looked around

841
00:33:16.147 --> 00:33:18.107
and I see the store Ross, okay?

842
00:33:18.107 --> 00:33:19.887
Now, to my knowledge,

843
00:33:19.887 --> 00:33:23.367
Ross doesn't carry Halloween costumes.

844
00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:26.147
So we walk over there anyway,

845
00:33:26.147 --> 00:33:28.867
we go back to the little girls section,

846
00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:33.327
and there, in a zippered wardrobe pouch,

847
00:33:33.327 --> 00:33:36.467
is a little girl's diva outfit--

848
00:33:36.467 --> 00:33:37.127
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

849
00:33:37.127 --> 00:33:39.387
<v ->Just in her size, and get this,</v>

850
00:33:39.387 --> 00:33:41.127
for five dollars and 49 cents!

851
00:33:41.127 --> 00:33:42.447
Oh my gosh!

852
00:33:42.447 --> 00:33:45.307
So, you know, we bought it, of course,

853
00:33:45.307 --> 00:33:46.707
and she looked so cute in it,

854
00:33:46.707 --> 00:33:49.567
but here's another miracle story.

855
00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:52.447
So, they had two there,

856
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:56.227
one with purple pants and one with black pants.

857
00:33:56.227 --> 00:33:59.807
Well, she looked so cute in the black pants

858
00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:01.687
that I said to her, I said, "You know, honey,

859
00:34:01.687 --> 00:34:04.248
"if we take off the red sash

860
00:34:04.248 --> 00:34:06.147
"and put a different top with these,

861
00:34:06.147 --> 00:34:09.748
"these pants are so cute, you could wear 'em to school.

862
00:34:09.748 --> 00:34:12.027
"And for five dollars and 49 cents,

863
00:34:12.027 --> 00:34:14.587
"I think I'm gonna go back and get the purple pair."

864
00:34:14.587 --> 00:34:17.407
Well I went back, and it was very next day.

865
00:34:17.407 --> 00:34:19.067
Nowhere to be found.

866
00:34:19.067 --> 00:34:21.207
So I just closed my eyes and I said,

867
00:34:21.207 --> 00:34:23.508
"Okay, Halloween costume designer.

868
00:34:23.508 --> 00:34:26.407
"You know that outfit that you got for me?

869
00:34:26.407 --> 00:34:28.027
"Well, remember the purple pair?

870
00:34:28.027 --> 00:34:29.947
"I'd love to have those."

871
00:34:29.947 --> 00:34:31.787
So I opened my eyes, went back to the rack.

872
00:34:31.787 --> 00:34:35.628
There it was, right in front.

873
00:34:35.628 --> 00:34:37.017
(Regina sighs)

874
00:34:37.017 --> 00:34:38.147
<v Regina>I love it.</v>

875
00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:39.503
I love all of this.

876
00:34:39.503 --> 00:34:42.803
And it's, again, you have to have

877
00:34:42.803 --> 00:34:45.483
that belief within you

878
00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:50.103
that you have the right to create your own experience.

879
00:34:50.103 --> 00:34:50.923
<v ->Yes.</v>

880
00:34:50.923 --> 00:34:53.523
<v Regina>And that it is your not only right,</v>

881
00:34:53.523 --> 00:34:56.743
it's your responsibility to call out

882
00:34:56.743 --> 00:34:59.483
for the help you need in this creation process

883
00:34:59.483 --> 00:35:03.084
because in every one of our lives this is a co-creation.

884
00:35:03.084 --> 00:35:04.123
<v ->Right, it is.</v>

885
00:35:04.123 --> 00:35:06.683
And somehow we've gotten the wrong message

886
00:35:06.683 --> 00:35:08.501
that we've gotta make it on our own.

887
00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:08.961
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

888
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:11.301
<v ->That somehow we've been marooned here</v>

889
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:12.461
and you sink or swim

890
00:35:12.461 --> 00:35:13.501
and you make it on your own

891
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:16.801
and furthermore, not only are you marooned here,

892
00:35:16.801 --> 00:35:19.841
but you've got to earn your way back.

893
00:35:19.841 --> 00:35:20.541
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

894
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:21.081
<v ->Yeah.</v>

895
00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:22.411
<v Regina>No.</v>

896
00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:24.379
No, I'm on the same page with you.

897
00:35:24.379 --> 00:35:26.390
I don't buy that.

898
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.748
Suffering is not something that is, to me,

899
00:35:29.748 --> 00:35:31.568
a requirement.

900
00:35:31.568 --> 00:35:35.948
And we all go through our moments of pain,

901
00:35:35.948 --> 00:35:36.568
you know?

902
00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:37.928
Life offers challenges.

903
00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:38.628
We all go through that.

904
00:35:38.628 --> 00:35:40.248
But you can slide through it gracefully.

905
00:35:40.248 --> 00:35:42.289
It doesn't have to be about suffering.

906
00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:43.868
The journey does not have to be.

907
00:35:43.868 --> 00:35:47.228
I just do not relate to that message at all.

908
00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:49.008
And I think maybe that's why I so relate

909
00:35:49.008 --> 00:35:51.168
to what you're saying in these page.

910
00:35:51.168 --> 00:35:52.708
You've really done a beautiful job.

911
00:35:52.708 --> 00:35:54.088
Is there anything else?

912
00:35:54.088 --> 00:35:56.168
There's so much more in this little,

913
00:35:56.168 --> 00:35:57.828
it's a little book, but there's still so much more

914
00:35:57.828 --> 00:36:01.008
to work with, and certainly I'm highly encouraging

915
00:36:01.008 --> 00:36:02.149
people to pick up a copy.

916
00:36:02.149 --> 00:36:03.928
I'm giving it to my girlfriends for Christmas,

917
00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:07.029
as a matter of fact, because I think it's that important.

918
00:36:07.029 --> 00:36:08.388
Anything else you'd like to say

919
00:36:08.388 --> 00:36:10.248
before we wrap our interview up?

920
00:36:10.248 --> 00:36:12.668
<v ->Well it really is the most important thing</v>

921
00:36:12.668 --> 00:36:17.289
for people to really get that this is a gift to them

922
00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:19.088
and there isn't anything that they have to do

923
00:36:19.088 --> 00:36:20.168
to earn it.

924
00:36:20.168 --> 00:36:23.968
And what will hold them back the most

925
00:36:23.968 --> 00:36:26.228
from utilizing this

926
00:36:26.228 --> 00:36:28.268
is the worthiness issue.

927
00:36:28.268 --> 00:36:28.768
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

928
00:36:28.768 --> 00:36:32.128
<v ->And feeling that somehow they have to earn it,</v>

929
00:36:32.128 --> 00:36:33.668
somehow they have to justify it,

930
00:36:33.668 --> 00:36:35.628
somehow they have to be good enough,

931
00:36:35.628 --> 00:36:38.468
somehow they have to be lovable enough.

932
00:36:38.468 --> 00:36:40.909
You know, I'll tell a story again about my daughter

933
00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:42.289
that really exemplifies this

934
00:36:42.289 --> 00:36:44.768
because these thoughts come,

935
00:36:44.768 --> 00:36:48.248
it's almost as if they're innate within us.

936
00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:52.178
They come from a place very deep within

937
00:36:52.178 --> 00:36:55.988
that we feel, in essence,

938
00:36:55.988 --> 00:36:58.328
that we have been marooned here,

939
00:36:58.328 --> 00:37:02.548
and that we've been, in some ways, forgotten.

940
00:37:02.548 --> 00:37:05.736
My daughter, now this is just

941
00:37:05.736 --> 00:37:07.436
when she was bit older,

942
00:37:07.436 --> 00:37:11.096
we did an addition on our home, and in her room,

943
00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:12.736
she has her own sink,

944
00:37:12.736 --> 00:37:16.696
and we did her bedroom in a motif, like an aquarium,

945
00:37:16.696 --> 00:37:19.356
so she has big seahorses painted on the walls

946
00:37:19.356 --> 00:37:21.916
and seashells and all that sort of thing.

947
00:37:21.916 --> 00:37:23.986
So we wanted to get something

948
00:37:23.986 --> 00:37:28.713
that would match that

949
00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:31.893
motif for her sink accessories,

950
00:37:31.893 --> 00:37:35.032
and so we went to Mervyn's,

951
00:37:35.032 --> 00:37:37.393
Mervyn's was still around at the time,

952
00:37:37.393 --> 00:37:39.854
and she found this nice little thing

953
00:37:39.854 --> 00:37:41.194
that had seashells on it.

954
00:37:41.194 --> 00:37:44.954
It was cute but it was rather an older version,

955
00:37:44.954 --> 00:37:46.793
so I said to her, "You know what?

956
00:37:46.793 --> 00:37:49.053
"We forgot to hire from the heavens.

957
00:37:49.053 --> 00:37:51.133
"This is nice but it doesn't fit you,

958
00:37:51.133 --> 00:37:53.113
"so let's go out to the car

959
00:37:53.113 --> 00:37:57.165
"and hire a spiritual bathroom accessory specialist."

960
00:37:57.165 --> 00:37:59.204
So we did that and I said to her, I said,

961
00:37:59.204 --> 00:38:02.104
"Okay, tell your bathroom accessory specialist

962
00:38:02.104 --> 00:38:03.104
"what you want."

963
00:38:03.104 --> 00:38:04.424
She says, "Okay, I want something

964
00:38:04.424 --> 00:38:06.705
"that's bright turquoise with popping-out fish,

965
00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:09.485
"and something that's really colorful and fun!"

966
00:38:09.485 --> 00:38:11.445
And I said, "Great, now where do we need to go?"

967
00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:13.544
She said, "Bed Bath &amp; Beyond!"

968
00:38:13.544 --> 00:38:15.724
So we drive over to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,

969
00:38:15.724 --> 00:38:17.304
she comes around the corner,

970
00:38:17.304 --> 00:38:18.804
and I hear this big scream,

971
00:38:18.804 --> 00:38:19.944
"Oh my God!"

972
00:38:19.944 --> 00:38:24.554
and so I run fast to see what she's looking at

973
00:38:24.554 --> 00:38:26.184
and I just couldn't help myself.

974
00:38:26.184 --> 00:38:30.745
There it was, exactly what she had asked for,

975
00:38:30.745 --> 00:38:32.503
and it was on clearance.

976
00:38:32.503 --> 00:38:33.304
I love it.

977
00:38:33.304 --> 00:38:36.245
My angels always know I like a bargain.

978
00:38:36.245 --> 00:38:38.124
And I just scream, "Oh my God!" you know.

979
00:38:38.124 --> 00:38:41.285
"This is fantastic, this is just what you asked for!"

980
00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.705
So we get it out to the car,

981
00:38:42.705 --> 00:38:44.684
and I'm telling you, you know,

982
00:38:44.684 --> 00:38:47.265
that's the joy that the angels are looking for,

983
00:38:47.265 --> 00:38:50.165
the smile on my daughter's face.

984
00:38:50.165 --> 00:38:53.425
She was just, like, giggling she was so happy.

985
00:38:53.425 --> 00:38:55.104
So we get out to the car and I said,

986
00:38:55.104 --> 00:38:57.444
"You know, honey, this obviously

987
00:38:57.444 --> 00:39:00.045
"worked so well for you.

988
00:39:00.045 --> 00:39:02.124
"I've gotta ask you a question here.

989
00:39:02.124 --> 00:39:03.764
"In the past when I've asked you

990
00:39:03.764 --> 00:39:06.583
"to hire from the heavens, you've always said to me,

991
00:39:06.583 --> 00:39:09.165
"'You do it for me, Mom.'"

992
00:39:09.165 --> 00:39:13.663
And I said, "Well, this worked so well for you," you know.

993
00:39:13.663 --> 00:39:17.064
"Why haven't you done it in the past?"

994
00:39:17.064 --> 00:39:19.765
And she said to me the most profound thing,

995
00:39:19.765 --> 00:39:21.584
'cause it's nothing I ever taught her.

996
00:39:21.584 --> 00:39:25.185
She said to me, "Well, Mom, I was afraid

997
00:39:25.185 --> 00:39:27.425
"that if I asked for something

998
00:39:27.425 --> 00:39:29.985
"and I didn't get what I wanted,

999
00:39:29.985 --> 00:39:32.045
"it would mean they didn't like me."

1000
00:39:32.045 --> 00:39:32.944
<v Regina>Hmm.</v>

1001
00:39:32.944 --> 00:39:35.585
<v ->And I thought to myself, wow.</v>

1002
00:39:35.585 --> 00:39:37.824
We all have that fear inside.

1003
00:39:37.824 --> 00:39:42.125
We all have that fear that somehow if we ask for something,

1004
00:39:42.125 --> 00:39:43.044
and we don't get it,

1005
00:39:43.044 --> 00:39:45.324
it's just proof that--

1006
00:39:45.324 --> 00:39:46.125
<v Regina>That we're not enough.</v>

1007
00:39:46.125 --> 00:39:47.204
<v ->We're not enough.</v>

1008
00:39:47.204 --> 00:39:48.885
We're not lovable enough,

1009
00:39:48.885 --> 00:39:49.803
we're not good enough,

1010
00:39:49.803 --> 00:39:50.904
we didn't do it right.

1011
00:39:50.904 --> 00:39:52.724
You know, all of that.

1012
00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:56.004
So the most important thing

1013
00:39:56.004 --> 00:39:58.464
that I would like people to take away from this interview

1014
00:39:58.464 --> 00:40:01.465
is to know that this is a gift to them.

1015
00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:04.224
There isn't anything that they have to do to earn it.

1016
00:40:04.224 --> 00:40:06.044
They are enough.

1017
00:40:06.044 --> 00:40:07.325
They are lovable enough.

1018
00:40:07.325 --> 00:40:08.825
They are--

1019
00:40:08.825 --> 00:40:11.205
<v Regina>Like Stuart Smalley.</v>

1020
00:40:11.205 --> 00:40:11.804
<v ->Pardon me?</v>

1021
00:40:11.804 --> 00:40:13.565
<v Regina>Like Stuart Smalley looking in the mirror.</v>

1022
00:40:13.565 --> 00:40:15.124
"I am good enough.

1023
00:40:15.124 --> 00:40:16.364
"I am lovable."

1024
00:40:16.364 --> 00:40:17.364
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1025
00:40:17.364 --> 00:40:19.365
<v Regina>Yes, very true.</v>

1026
00:40:19.365 --> 00:40:21.404
And I think one other element in this

1027
00:40:21.404 --> 00:40:25.065
that you did write about just as a kind of a final thought

1028
00:40:25.065 --> 00:40:26.785
is it doesn't matter how small

1029
00:40:26.785 --> 00:40:28.505
and it doesn't matter how large,

1030
00:40:28.505 --> 00:40:29.985
and on some of the large issues

1031
00:40:29.985 --> 00:40:33.405
you put it out there the way you want a resolution,

1032
00:40:33.405 --> 00:40:36.283
how you want something to flow within your life,

1033
00:40:36.283 --> 00:40:39.704
and then stand back and let yourself be surprised.

1034
00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:41.924
It may not look like an exact picture

1035
00:40:41.924 --> 00:40:43.084
of something you thought,

1036
00:40:43.084 --> 00:40:44.665
but it may be way better.

1037
00:40:44.665 --> 00:40:45.925
<v ->It may be, and so--</v>

1038
00:40:45.925 --> 00:40:47.044
<v Regina>And that's what I find oftentimes.</v>

1039
00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:48.824
I couldn't have conceived of such a wonderful

1040
00:40:48.824 --> 00:40:50.565
outcome to something.

1041
00:40:50.565 --> 00:40:53.324
It's just having faith to put your feelings out there,

1042
00:40:53.324 --> 00:40:54.964
your desire out there.

1043
00:40:54.964 --> 00:40:57.884
And like you say, a joyful, playful way.

1044
00:40:57.884 --> 00:40:58.134
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1045
00:40:58.134 --> 00:40:59.239
<v Regina>Don't make it dire.</v>

1046
00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:01.179
Even though there are those desperate pleas.

1047
00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:01.779
(Regina laughs)

1048
00:41:01.779 --> 00:41:04.059
<v ->Yes, there is,</v>

1049
00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:07.039
but stay in an attitude of playfulness.

1050
00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:08.660
Stay with trust.

1051
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.999
Know that it is always being worked out for you

1052
00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:14.020
and every single request is heard.

1053
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.620
Never doubt that.

1054
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.900
There is never any that goes unheard.

1055
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.360
Everything is heard.

1056
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.639
And you know I got confirmation

1057
00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:25.519
from a good friend of mine,

1058
00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:28.119
Sheila and Marcus Gillette.

1059
00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.120
Sheila channels--

1060
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.819
<v Regina>We've interviewed Sheila and Chloe</v>

1061
00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:33.933
and we've also interviewed Theo.

1062
00:41:33.933 --> 00:41:34.673
<v ->Yes.</v>

1063
00:41:34.673 --> 00:41:36.413
<v Regina>And that, oh, I know what you're going to say,</v>

1064
00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:37.693
this is very cool.

1065
00:41:37.693 --> 00:41:40.054
<v ->Yeah, and Theo talks about that.</v>

1066
00:41:40.054 --> 00:41:42.374
This is from the other side.

1067
00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:42.913
<v Regina>Yes!</v>

1068
00:41:42.913 --> 00:41:43.954
<v ->And it's just so wonderful</v>

1069
00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:45.173
to get that kind of confirmation--

1070
00:41:45.173 --> 00:41:46.333
<v Regina>Well he talks about your book.</v>

1071
00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:49.973
The Theo Group tells people to get your book,

1072
00:41:49.973 --> 00:41:50.654
as a matter of fact,

1073
00:41:50.654 --> 00:41:53.633
because it exemplifies these principles in action.

1074
00:41:53.633 --> 00:41:54.234
<v ->It does.</v>

1075
00:41:54.234 --> 00:41:58.854
And they confirmed that yes, some are good at,

1076
00:41:58.854 --> 00:42:03.314
some on the angelic realm are good at some things

1077
00:42:03.314 --> 00:42:04.834
and some are good at other things,

1078
00:42:04.834 --> 00:42:09.014
and so when you call upon a specialist in that area,

1079
00:42:09.014 --> 00:42:13.432
that specialist will arrive and will assist you.

1080
00:42:13.432 --> 00:42:17.992
And they say that no prayer, no request goes unheard.

1081
00:42:17.992 --> 00:42:21.551
And that was so heartwarming and confirming.

1082
00:42:21.551 --> 00:42:22.991
<v Regina>Very much so.</v>

1083
00:42:22.991 --> 00:42:24.391
Well thank you very much for your time

1084
00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:27.052
and for writing this wonderful little book.

1085
00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:29.871
And I can't wait to see the reactions of my friends

1086
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:33.712
after they read it for their holiday presents.

1087
00:42:33.712 --> 00:42:35.012
<v ->Thank you so much, Regina.</v>

1088
00:42:35.012 --> 00:42:36.941
It's been a pleasure.

1089
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.487
(soft music)

1090
00:42:39.487 --> 00:42:41.367
<v ->I highly recommend getting a copy</v>

1091
00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:43.087
of Hiring the Heavens for yourself

1092
00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:44.426
and for your friends who would like

1093
00:42:44.426 --> 00:42:46.746
to have life run a little more smoothly.

1094
00:42:46.746 --> 00:42:48.307
I've been doing this myself for years

1095
00:42:48.307 --> 00:42:50.587
and I can vouch for its effectiveness.

1096
00:42:50.587 --> 00:42:53.396
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1097
00:42:54.286 --> 00:42:56.770
