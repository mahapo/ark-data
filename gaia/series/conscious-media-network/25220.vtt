(gentle guitar tune)

00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:08.063
<v ->As our bodies pass through the stages of life</v>

3
00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:10.060
most people begin losing energy.

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.972
This devitalization has many contributing factors,

5
00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:14.593
not the least of which is a reduction

6
00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.825
in our body's production of certain critical hormones.

7
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:20.220
In an attempt to stem the effects of hormone loss

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.726
many women, in particular, have been consuming

9
00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:24.721
synthetic hormones and what's called

10
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.352
hormone replacement therapy

11
00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:29.847
but medicine has seen the downsides now including cancer.

12
00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:32.439
Doctor Theresa Dale, a naturopath and founder

13
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.903
of the California College of Natural Medicine,

14
00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:37.549
says there's a much safer and more effective means

15
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:39.223
of balancing our hormones.

16
00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:42.220
She calls it her hormone revitalization system

17
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.492
and it's based on homeopathy.

18
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:48.108
I'm so happy to be sitting here talking to you

19
00:00:48.108 --> 00:00:50.039
about this subject because there is a great deal

20
00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.014
of conflicted information and confusion around it,

21
00:00:53.014 --> 00:00:55.937
and I know that probably quite a few of our viewers

22
00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:58.145
watching this right now are wondering

23
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.577
what to do as we go through life

24
00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:02.603
and the hormone profile starts changing,

25
00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:05.088
we don't feel quite as vital as we used to

26
00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:07.808
and then all the other things start cascading.

27
00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:11.264
And what intrigues me about your work

28
00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:14.922
is when I read that you can use homeopathics

29
00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:16.725
in the rebalancing of hormones,

30
00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:19.551
it peaked my curiosity to where we just took a detour

31
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:21.649
north to Ventura to see you today.

32
00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.455
<v ->And I'm so grateful that you did.</v>

33
00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:25.067
<v Regina>Well, and I am too, I'm very happy</v>

34
00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:27.565
I found out about you albeit at the last moment,

35
00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:29.261
so I can't wait...

36
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:31.684
It's neat because I get to find out along

37
00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:34.141
with everybody else what this story is about.

38
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:34.893
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

39
00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:37.709
<v Regina>Let's start out first of all with the human body,</v>

40
00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.905
what happens naturally when we start

41
00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:45.453
having diminishing hormones as we get to a certain age

42
00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:48.492
and why we should even bother doing anything about it

43
00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:51.001
at all, I mean that's another question, I suppose.

44
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.710
We could just go into degeneration.

45
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.430
<v ->Well, you know, as we know from our grandmothers</v>

46
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.725
and historically the way women have cycled

47
00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:03.469
because we know, I know historically how women have cycled

48
00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.420
and according to the tides of the Earth

49
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.380
and the moon and all of that historically.

50
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.926
What we know is that when women reach

51
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:18.161
a certain age depending upon their biological

52
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:21.684
intelligence or biological age

53
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:25.923
or their genetics that their body

54
00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:30.119
really starts changing the way it produces hormones.

55
00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.303
And this could be very indicative

56
00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:38.736
of a person who does not handle stress well,

57
00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:43.341
who has created a voluminous amount

58
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:46.189
or a massive amount of stress in their life,

59
00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.783
and I use the word, created, because I believe

60
00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:54.489
that in some respect, we actually create our own reality

61
00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.730
and we can actually heal our own disease

62
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.004
because basically people,

63
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:03.074
it's legal to heal your own disease.

64
00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:05.877
A lot of people, when I lecture, say to me,

65
00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:08.643
"Gee, can I do that ? Can I really heal my disease?"

66
00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:10.975
I say, "There's no law against it.

67
00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:14.320
"Why not? You can do anything you want."

68
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.398
So, at a certain age, the ovaries

69
00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.866
start producing less hormones but the real problem here

70
00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:25.471
is the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis.

71
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:29.058
You've got, abbreviated it's an HPA axis,

72
00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:32.524
and that axis has to be balanced

73
00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:36.649
or hormones are going to be imbalanced, okay?

74
00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.488
So the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the adrenals

75
00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:44.111
have to be communicating

76
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.297
with the ovaries, with themselves,

77
00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:49.582
and then if they're not, it's because of stress,

78
00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:53.785
it's because of lifestyle, medications.

79
00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:58.764
Hormones can throw, if you're taking medication hormones

80
00:03:58.764 --> 00:04:02.514
it can throw and will throw the HPA axis

81
00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:06.635
out of balance so that your body will no longer

82
00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.280
produce the correct amount of hormones

83
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.034
and your adrenal glands will be very unhappy.

84
00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:16.992
And as we get older, we depend upon the adrenal glands

85
00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:21.015
to pick it up and make the hormones that you need

86
00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.843
because that's what their job is.

87
00:04:23.843 --> 00:04:27.565
But often times health providers

88
00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.796
don't tell their patients that.

89
00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.602
Instead, they just prescribe hormones.

90
00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:36.890
But if they prescribed homeopathy or nutrition

91
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.026
or herbology or diet or something else,

92
00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.629
the person would feel so much better.

93
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.584
They wouldn't become dependent

94
00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:49.506
on using hormones of any kind.

95
00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:53.271
So when we're under stress,

96
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:56.823
we can actually have hot flashes from it.

97
00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:59.980
Women contact us and say,

98
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.327
"All of a sudden, everything was going well

99
00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:05.464
"and my mother died and now I'm having hot flashes."

100
00:05:05.464 --> 00:05:08.151
That's because of the stress, okay?

101
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:12.620
If you drink too much caffeine, it stresses and exhausts

102
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.724
and dehydrates the adrenal glands.

103
00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:19.852
So even sometimes a little bit of caffeine can do that

104
00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.849
and sometimes green tea can do that as well.

105
00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.334
A lot of people think, oh, green tea is fine

106
00:05:25.334 --> 00:05:27.991
but not necessarily, it depends on your body

107
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:32.344
and the sensitivity and your genetics.

108
00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:36.766
So we're looking at the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis

109
00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:40.025
as far as that being balanced key.

110
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:44.505
So what I decided to do after practising for 30 years,

111
00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:49.175
I decided that I had had enough of women

112
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:54.029
coming in to me with hysterectomies or mastectomies

113
00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:57.956
and knowing that their hormones were out of balance

114
00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:01.310
yet their blood tests were okay

115
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.010
and I thought there is a problem here.

116
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.497
Many years ago, 15, 20 years ago,

117
00:06:06.497 --> 00:06:09.632
I started investigating saliva testing.

118
00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:13.106
And that has come a very long way

119
00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:17.878
historically and as far as through research.

120
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:22.752
The lab that I work with, the owner invented saliva testing

121
00:06:22.752 --> 00:06:24.702
and he has done

122
00:06:26.592 --> 00:06:30.844
millions of women all over the world

123
00:06:30.844 --> 00:06:33.761
comparing the studies from England, women in England,

124
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:37.303
how it is their saliva testing from England

125
00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:39.302
or from Germany or from other countries--

126
00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:41.202
<v Regina>Different gene pools, different environments.</v>

127
00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.539
<v ->Right, from the Middle East, so his research</v>

128
00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.896
is really phenomenal and I give him a lot of credit.

129
00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:50.815
And I gleaned a lot of information from that

130
00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:55.210
so that I could do my research because blood testing,

131
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.610
the reference ranges are too wide

132
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.233
and it's not sensitive enough.

133
00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:04.090
Saliva testing shows the free unbound hormones, unbound,

134
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.520
so it's more sensitive and you get a quicker reading

135
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.663
on what's going on with your body, in other words,

136
00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:12.016
if you started taking hormones

137
00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:14.522
and then tested it two months from now,

138
00:07:14.522 --> 00:07:17.317
you may not see very much of a difference.

139
00:07:17.317 --> 00:07:19.215
If you did it four months from now,

140
00:07:19.215 --> 00:07:21.180
let's say you start taking hormones now,

141
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.996
in four months you may not see too much of a difference,

142
00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:26.871
maybe a little bit towards them going up.

143
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:31.237
But after a year of taking blood tests

144
00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:33.633
you may see a little bit more difference

145
00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:36.791
but let's compare that now to saliva testing.

146
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:40.598
After two months of your doing bioidentical hormones

147
00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:43.937
or phytoestrogens or synthetic hormones,

148
00:07:43.937 --> 00:07:46.594
you're gonna see the definite reality of what it's doing

149
00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:48.663
to your body, no uncertain terms.

150
00:07:48.663 --> 00:07:51.501
Two months, three months, at the most.

151
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:55.470
And then when you start using

152
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.277
diet and natural things and seeing how it corrects it,

153
00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:02.316
you're gonna be able to see the correction in two months,

154
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:04.919
where your body is in two months

155
00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:07.105
after starting your program.

156
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:09.569
Women love that because they have,

157
00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:13.413
it's not an instant vision but two months

158
00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:17.018
isn't that long compared to waiting a year or eight months

159
00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:20.517
or six months to see something.

160
00:08:20.517 --> 00:08:25.261
So in working with the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis,

161
00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:29.936
just ovarian functioning

162
00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:34.012
and all those symptomologies that women have

163
00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:36.487
as they go through menopause,

164
00:08:36.487 --> 00:08:40.025
I decided to make my hormone rejuvenation cremes

165
00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:44.588
from homeopathy without any preservatives

166
00:08:44.588 --> 00:08:47.745
or without any fragrances and all very clean

167
00:08:47.745 --> 00:08:51.633
and a medical grade, liposome-based that was transdermal.

168
00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:53.216
And then I set about a course

169
00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:55.657
to start testing to see if it works.

170
00:08:55.657 --> 00:08:57.539
Well, everybody knows homeopathy

171
00:08:57.539 --> 00:09:00.245
has a 200-year-old history and that it works.

172
00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:00.945
<v Regina>Right.</v>

173
00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:03.790
<v ->But I formulated things together,</v>

174
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.757
combination of formulas together in a synergistic way

175
00:09:07.757 --> 00:09:10.679
and I wanted to see if it took anything away

176
00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:15.297
from the efficacy of homeopathy or it added to the efficacy

177
00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:17.364
and just seeing what it would do.

178
00:09:17.364 --> 00:09:21.435
We had such phenomenal success

179
00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:25.954
from our doctors that I trained which are over 1,000

180
00:09:25.954 --> 00:09:30.060
health providers that I trained, that I said,

181
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.856
"Okay, this is really good, this is really good,"

182
00:09:32.856 --> 00:09:35.071
and because we could see within two months

183
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:37.075
that there was a change and we could see which way

184
00:09:37.075 --> 00:09:39.134
the change was going, if it was getting better,

185
00:09:39.134 --> 00:09:41.502
how much better, and what are they eating,

186
00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:43.136
are they following the program or not,

187
00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:44.629
are they drinking coffee or not?

188
00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:48.416
Because caffeine neutralizes homeopathy.

189
00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:51.643
It neutralizes the effects of homeopathy along with a few

190
00:09:51.643 --> 00:09:54.482
other things but that's really the main thing.

191
00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:56.724
So in other words, if you're using homeopathy

192
00:09:56.724 --> 00:09:58.995
and then you drink caffeine, you just wiped it out.

193
00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:00.464
<v Regina>And that means even green tea,</v>

194
00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:02.245
even the slightest bit of caffeine?

195
00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:03.810
<v ->Yes, even so.</v>

196
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.093
And I have seen it in cases

197
00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:10.263
where when I did my research in Germany,

198
00:10:10.263 --> 00:10:12.934
I studied there for nine years,

199
00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:15.335
going there for months and coming back and working

200
00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:17.911
on patients, going there for another four, five months--

201
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:19.421
<v Regina>Is it the Hahnemann?</v>

202
00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:22.195
<v ->No, it was actually through the Hans Bergman</v>

203
00:10:22.195 --> 00:10:23.707
Institute in Munich.

204
00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:24.407
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

205
00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:27.081
<v ->And through their organization they set up</v>

206
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:31.774
English classes with physicists and biophysicists

207
00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:36.003
so I learned the most phenomenal

208
00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:39.369
holistic medicine with things that people

209
00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:41.280
in the United States have never heard of,

210
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.530
like neural therapy,

211
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.198
like advanced homeopathy

212
00:10:47.198 --> 00:10:50.934
using the blood, urine, and saliva of the patient,

213
00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:54.316
making a homeopathic remedy from blood, urine, and saliva

214
00:10:54.316 --> 00:10:57.613
to cure disease, any disease.

215
00:10:57.613 --> 00:11:00.318
And that's what they do in Europe and they use

216
00:11:00.318 --> 00:11:03.619
live cell therapy and I've learned, so it was like,

217
00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:06.116
I couldn't wait to go back for the next journey,

218
00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:07.333
it was like so exciting.

219
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.290
<v Regina>Oh, yes.</v>

220
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.174
<v ->So, my point is that...</v>

221
00:11:15.724 --> 00:11:19.189
Using homeopathy is the best way to handle hormones

222
00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:22.051
because it cannot overproduce estrogens.

223
00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:24.333
And when a woman has cancer,

224
00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:27.888
that is a vital concern

225
00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:32.109
of the doctor, endocrinologist, and of the patient

226
00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:36.978
not to use anything that will exacerbate estrogen

227
00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:40.085
and to create estrogen dominance.

228
00:11:40.085 --> 00:11:41.781
You don't want to do that.

229
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:45.410
So homeopathy cannot do that, it's not possible.

230
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.941
It will balance hormones, it will balance the progesterone,

231
00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:52.588
estrogen, testosterone, depending upon the formula.

232
00:11:52.588 --> 00:11:55.430
So after all this time, I have 20,000

233
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.839
before-and-after saliva tests or more.

234
00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:02.025
I stopped counting a few years ago at 20,000.

235
00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:03.674
<v Regina>I think that's a fair enough test.</v>

236
00:12:03.674 --> 00:12:06.884
<v ->Right, and I don't think there are any other people</v>

237
00:12:06.884 --> 00:12:11.624
whether it's at the FDA or any of the pharmaceutical

238
00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:15.847
companies that actually test over a couple of hundred,

239
00:12:15.847 --> 00:12:18.726
maybe a couple of thousand people at the very most.

240
00:12:18.726 --> 00:12:23.558
So I went way beyond that to prove that homeopathy works.

241
00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:28.401
It works in a synergistic way in the formulas that I have

242
00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:33.003
which include homeopathic ingredients

243
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:37.245
to balance cortisol, to balance the adrenal function,

244
00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:40.171
progesterone, and all of the good estrogens,

245
00:12:40.171 --> 00:12:42.369
free testosterone,

246
00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:46.298
to handle the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis,

247
00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:50.460
so it's really, very, very thorough and I think

248
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.957
that's why we're having such great success with it.

249
00:12:52.957 --> 00:12:57.085
But it's not only about taking a supplement

250
00:12:57.085 --> 00:13:00.573
or using homeopathic formulas.

251
00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:04.103
It's about the diet, it's about your mind,

252
00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:06.983
it's about what you're thinking, what you're believing,

253
00:13:06.983 --> 00:13:08.626
what you're feeling,

254
00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:12.412
how much you love yourself to take care of yourself

255
00:13:12.412 --> 00:13:16.389
and never giving away your power to any doctor or anyone.

256
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:17.159
Never.

257
00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:20.134
I mean, if you do that, no telling what can happen.

258
00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:23.447
You know, I see the results of that every day.

259
00:13:23.447 --> 00:13:27.700
So we want to really understand that education

260
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.149
is power and that what you're doing by interviewing me

261
00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:33.973
and others is giving people the power

262
00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:35.715
to take a different action,

263
00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:39.664
to take a better action and make a better choice for them.

264
00:13:39.664 --> 00:13:44.304
So I really believe that we need to reach people,

265
00:13:44.304 --> 00:13:47.797
communicate that they can heal their body.

266
00:13:47.797 --> 00:13:51.434
This is one of the reasons why in 1994,

267
00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:54.762
I created the California College of Natural Medicine.

268
00:13:54.762 --> 00:13:57.482
I founded it, I've written all the curriculum for it,

269
00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:59.969
it's state-approved in California.

270
00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:04.696
We have some entry-level trainings and we also have

271
00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:09.099
trainings that require prerequisites like licensure.

272
00:14:11.109 --> 00:14:13.769
So it's online, we have online courses

273
00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:18.407
and residential courses so anybody who's watching this today

274
00:14:19.507 --> 00:14:23.879
can actually take an action step

275
00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:27.085
to learn more through what you're doing

276
00:14:27.085 --> 00:14:29.668
and also if they choose to take it further

277
00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:32.942
by taking a training in clinical nutrition

278
00:14:32.942 --> 00:14:35.528
or homeopathic medical practitioner--

279
00:14:35.528 --> 00:14:37.132
<v Regina>I think quite a few of our viewers</v>

280
00:14:37.132 --> 00:14:39.351
are already involved in the healthcare industry

281
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:40.813
in some way or another.

282
00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:44.383
<v ->Right, and what's really great is that people can take it</v>

283
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:48.543
to the next level because homeopathy is vast.

284
00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:52.503
When I studied in Europe,

285
00:14:52.503 --> 00:14:55.766
I saw miracles happen with people

286
00:14:55.766 --> 00:15:00.642
with grand mal seizures where I saw doctors injecting,

287
00:15:02.082 --> 00:15:04.973
doing neural therapy and injecting homeopathy

288
00:15:04.973 --> 00:15:07.130
into acupuncture points.

289
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.932
Some of them were in the head

290
00:15:08.932 --> 00:15:11.268
and I've seen it stop seizures immediately.

291
00:15:11.268 --> 00:15:15.363
I've seen all kinds of things that, in this country,

292
00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:18.478
is not explored because of our AMA

293
00:15:18.478 --> 00:15:20.957
and all the FDA and everything.

294
00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:22.857
<v Regina>And we're pretty much, we're on that page.</v>

295
00:15:22.857 --> 00:15:25.765
We understand that part, now as you're talking,

296
00:15:25.765 --> 00:15:29.434
I'm wondering about the...

297
00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:32.369
I have two or three different strands of thought going on.

298
00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:35.068
One of them is, certainly the person that's out there

299
00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:38.831
talking the loudest about all this would be Suzanne Somers,

300
00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:40.537
right, and the books she's written.

301
00:15:40.537 --> 00:15:43.470
And she does have an overall approach to health

302
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.408
and the emotional aspects of life

303
00:15:45.408 --> 00:15:47.993
but she's really big on the bioidenticals.

304
00:15:47.993 --> 00:15:48.730
<v ->Right.</v>

305
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.003
<v Regina>So now let's talk about standard HRT,</v>

306
00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.724
hormone replacement therapy that's synthetic

307
00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:57.614
that you're going to get from your doctor

308
00:15:57.614 --> 00:16:00.747
at your HMO and then go through from there

309
00:16:00.747 --> 00:16:03.914
to the bioidenticals and then into homeopathics

310
00:16:03.914 --> 00:16:05.669
so we can see the difference.

311
00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:08.283
<v ->And there's also the phytoestrogens that you buy</v>

312
00:16:08.283 --> 00:16:11.366
in health food stores and the progesterone creme.

313
00:16:11.366 --> 00:16:13.866
They're in health food stores

314
00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:16.690
in a creme form as a cosmeceutical.

315
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.386
<v Regina>Yes, now let's talk about all of those</v>

316
00:16:18.386 --> 00:16:20.988
and what's actually going on from your studies.

317
00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:21.711
<v ->Okay.</v>

318
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:23.059
<v Regina>Starting with HRT.</v>

319
00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:27.217
<v ->Whether it's, what I've seen to cut to the chase</v>

320
00:16:27.217 --> 00:16:31.336
is from looking at 20,000 saliva tests,

321
00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:35.281
before-and after, is that no matter

322
00:16:35.281 --> 00:16:40.094
whether it is synthetic or it is biosimilar,

323
00:16:41.324 --> 00:16:45.456
biosimilar, once it's compounded, it's no longer natural,

324
00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:50.984
so the supposedly bioidentical hormones are compounded.

325
00:16:50.984 --> 00:16:55.632
So at that point, it is not exactly

326
00:16:55.632 --> 00:16:59.464
the same as what the body produces although in a petri dish,

327
00:16:59.464 --> 00:17:03.113
in a test tube, they may have created something

328
00:17:03.113 --> 00:17:07.863
bioidentically that they feel is bioidentically similar

329
00:17:08.893 --> 00:17:11.601
but your body doesn't look at it that way.

330
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:16.023
And one of the reasons is that we have a chronobiology

331
00:17:16.023 --> 00:17:19.532
about our body, our circadian rhythm cycle,

332
00:17:19.532 --> 00:17:24.033
and at certain times of the day, afternoon, and evening,

333
00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:28.225
we make different amounts of hormones at different times.

334
00:17:28.225 --> 00:17:31.873
Once you start putting hormones into your body,

335
00:17:31.873 --> 00:17:34.622
that whole chronobiology

336
00:17:34.622 --> 00:17:39.127
and the circadian rhythm cycle is skewed

337
00:17:40.137 --> 00:17:43.134
because the body is used to doing its own hormones,

338
00:17:43.134 --> 00:17:45.284
it making its own hormones.

339
00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:48.221
So then the body starts aging

340
00:17:48.221 --> 00:17:51.554
because it's no longer able to do it the way

341
00:17:51.554 --> 00:17:56.426
that it should be doing it and you have weight gain,

342
00:17:56.426 --> 00:18:00.258
you have just a lot of different symptoms,

343
00:18:00.258 --> 00:18:03.831
and I have had women come to us and tell us

344
00:18:03.831 --> 00:18:07.980
that they have cancer from the bioidentical hormones

345
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.501
and Suzanne Somers,

346
00:18:11.501 --> 00:18:15.401
and I bless her and everyone and have nothing negative

347
00:18:15.401 --> 00:18:18.274
to say and don't want to put that out there,

348
00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:22.242
but just in general about bioidentical hormones

349
00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:26.172
is that she had cancer

350
00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:29.089
while she was using the bioidentical hormones.

351
00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:33.170
And I've spoken to and tested

352
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.730
patients who had cancer from using it

353
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.770
and doctors have reported that to me as well,

354
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.535
and you can see that on a saliva test

355
00:18:44.535 --> 00:18:47.159
because on the saliva test I do,

356
00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:50.024
there's an HRT range

357
00:18:50.024 --> 00:18:53.486
that's just a little bit higher than the normal range

358
00:18:53.486 --> 00:18:57.438
and if they fall within that range, it's not too bad.

359
00:18:57.438 --> 00:18:58.782
It's okay.

360
00:18:58.782 --> 00:19:01.128
But most of the ones that we see

361
00:19:01.128 --> 00:19:05.470
in bioidentical hormones from using saliva testing,

362
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.919
it's like 500 times normal, 1,000 times normal.

363
00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:13.047
We're talking majorly toxic for the body

364
00:19:13.047 --> 00:19:15.927
and that's what I see, so I just report in my book

365
00:19:15.927 --> 00:19:19.617
what I see from these tests.

366
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:24.406
Now, I don't have access to the saliva specimens

367
00:19:24.406 --> 00:19:28.054
when they go into the lab, I don't have access to them,

368
00:19:28.054 --> 00:19:31.845
I don't own the lab, I have nothing to do with all of that.

369
00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:34.426
I just look at all the research

370
00:19:34.426 --> 00:19:37.849
and I develop comprehensive wellness

371
00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:41.705
optimization programs for my doctors' patients

372
00:19:41.705 --> 00:19:45.150
and then after that, we retest to see how it worked.

373
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.639
Is their estrogens down, how is their cancer,

374
00:19:47.639 --> 00:19:51.267
is it getting better, what's the situation here?

375
00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.849
There can be many things involved with this.

376
00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:59.039
Now, to answer your question about the bioidenticals,

377
00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:03.063
there is no proof and this is what the FDA says,

378
00:20:03.063 --> 00:20:07.248
that they are any different than synthetic, and I concur.

379
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.719
I see no difference in the levels.

380
00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:11.788
I see no difference in the outcome

381
00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:13.804
which is more important than anything.

382
00:20:13.804 --> 00:20:14.787
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

383
00:20:14.787 --> 00:20:15.907
<v ->You know what I'm saying?</v>

384
00:20:15.907 --> 00:20:18.314
Because a lot of people,

385
00:20:18.314 --> 00:20:22.614
and their doctors putting them on the right amount

386
00:20:22.614 --> 00:20:24.415
because they're coming to me and saying,

387
00:20:24.415 --> 00:20:26.191
"What am I doing wrong here?

388
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:27.900
"There is a problem with this patient.

389
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.249
"This is what I have her on, let's do a saliva test,

390
00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:32.340
"you tell me what you think."

391
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.100
That's what I know.

392
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.414
<v Regina>And so the biggest downside then,</v>

393
00:20:36.414 --> 00:20:38.931
from your observation, would be developing

394
00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:40.046
a cancer of some kind.

395
00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:43.396
<v ->Or strokes or blood clots or something else.</v>

396
00:20:43.396 --> 00:20:44.938
<v Regina>Because maybe they're feeling better.</v>

397
00:20:44.938 --> 00:20:46.398
Maybe they're saying, "Gosh, I've got a lot

398
00:20:46.398 --> 00:20:48.371
"of my energy back, I'm zipping around."

399
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:51.719
But then, long-term, they may run into these other issues.

400
00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:53.644
<v ->Right, we're concerned long-term,</v>

401
00:20:53.644 --> 00:20:55.474
like more than two, three months.

402
00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:57.917
We're concerned with long-term.

403
00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:01.053
Long-term, how it shuts down the adrenal glands

404
00:21:01.053 --> 00:21:03.111
and the adrenals start getting tired

405
00:21:03.111 --> 00:21:04.531
and they're not working anymore.

406
00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:06.536
<v Regina>Is that again because you've unlinked yourself</v>

407
00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:08.317
from the circadian rhythm?

408
00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:12.200
<v ->Yes, and also because they have</v>

409
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.857
their own cellular intelligence and they know

410
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:17.267
that they're supposed to be making these hormones,

411
00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:19.145
and all of a sudden it's...

412
00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:21.077
What happened?

413
00:21:21.077 --> 00:21:23.445
Guess I don't need to make them anymore.

414
00:21:23.445 --> 00:21:24.961
<v Regina>Right, well, that makes sense.</v>

415
00:21:24.961 --> 00:21:27.030
Now what happens when a person's gotten to the point

416
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.922
where they're kind of tanked on all of these hormones,

417
00:21:28.922 --> 00:21:31.971
the body is not making a lot of them anymore?

418
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:35.960
<v ->Well, the point is that I've never seen anyone,</v>

419
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.664
even 85 years old, that didn't make hormones.

420
00:21:40.664 --> 00:21:43.479
You would be dead if you didn't make hormones,

421
00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:46.476
so you are making hormones in small amounts

422
00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:49.594
and all you have to do is to revitalize your hormones

423
00:21:49.594 --> 00:21:52.385
by revitalizing, detoxifying, give the body

424
00:21:52.385 --> 00:21:55.862
the proper nutrition and having the person eat correctly,

425
00:21:55.862 --> 00:21:59.431
and let's look at what they're thinking.

426
00:21:59.431 --> 00:22:02.359
When people call and say,

427
00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:04.653
"I'm miserable today and blah, blah, blah,"

428
00:22:04.653 --> 00:22:08.183
and I talk to them on the phone many times and I say,

429
00:22:08.183 --> 00:22:11.073
"Okay, tell me what good is going on in your life."

430
00:22:11.073 --> 00:22:13.484
They go, "What do you mean?"

431
00:22:13.484 --> 00:22:17.900
And I say, "What is positive going on in your life?"

432
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.445
And it's like I'm, hello, to Earth.

433
00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:24.239
All of a sudden they got it and they go,

434
00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:27.001
"Well, I guess I never think about what's going on

435
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:29.028
"that's good in my life."

436
00:22:29.028 --> 00:22:30.469
And that is key.

437
00:22:30.469 --> 00:22:31.738
<v Regina>That's a sad comment.</v>

438
00:22:31.738 --> 00:22:32.518
<v ->It is sad.</v>

439
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:34.246
<v Regina>It's true for many, many people.</v>

440
00:22:34.246 --> 00:22:36.749
<v ->When I talk to somebody, I want to know all the good</v>

441
00:22:36.749 --> 00:22:38.263
and what they're feeling

442
00:22:38.263 --> 00:22:41.207
and I want to know how much their time they spend

443
00:22:41.207 --> 00:22:44.578
being grateful for being alive, having this opportunity,

444
00:22:44.578 --> 00:22:48.545
and what action steps are people taking to heal their body.

445
00:22:48.545 --> 00:22:52.623
Detoxification, every six months to a year,

446
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:56.194
a person should do detox.

447
00:22:56.194 --> 00:22:58.924
And for that purpose,

448
00:22:58.924 --> 00:23:02.508
and because I work with outpatient clinics of hospitals,

449
00:23:02.508 --> 00:23:04.919
so when they go into the outpatient clinic,

450
00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:08.970
they're on 19 meds, the docs call me, we put them

451
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.751
on my organic, wildcrafted in vegicap,

452
00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:17.045
herbal formulas to detoxify them

453
00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:19.702
and get them off of the medications.

454
00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:21.259
That's key.

455
00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:25.561
Believe me, there are some establishments,

456
00:23:25.561 --> 00:23:28.802
some clinics, some hospitals today, that are starting

457
00:23:28.802 --> 00:23:32.961
to shift and change into a more holistic way

458
00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:36.162
of doing things because people want it.

459
00:23:36.162 --> 00:23:39.479
<v Regina>So when you said the wildcrafted herbs</v>

460
00:23:39.479 --> 00:23:41.646
are one of the way that you would recommend--

461
00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:44.423
<v ->Detoxify as well as homeopathy, yeah.</v>

462
00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.627
<v Regina>And what are some of the things a person</v>

463
00:23:46.627 --> 00:23:49.998
who can't get to you or another practitioner can do

464
00:23:49.998 --> 00:23:52.547
to also help detoxify themselves,

465
00:23:52.547 --> 00:23:54.989
say, a couple of times a year, once a year?

466
00:23:54.989 --> 00:23:58.304
<v ->Okay, well, first of all, to do that,</v>

467
00:23:58.304 --> 00:24:00.907
you want to look at your diet, you want to eliminate

468
00:24:00.907 --> 00:24:03.799
as much as possible

469
00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:07.383
or any foods with preservatives or chemicals in them,

470
00:24:07.383 --> 00:24:10.348
and I would definitely eliminate any meats

471
00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:13.179
that are not organic, period.

472
00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:17.954
If you're eating out, just don't eat meat for that meal.

473
00:24:17.954 --> 00:24:21.175
Eat something else but try to eat at organic establishments

474
00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:23.437
if you can or buy organic food,

475
00:24:23.437 --> 00:24:27.091
clean it well because it still can have parasites on it.

476
00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:31.597
Parasites are a big deal, a lot of people have them

477
00:24:31.597 --> 00:24:33.773
and a lot of people don't know they have them.

478
00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:36.791
Most people who have cancer have them,

479
00:24:36.791 --> 00:24:39.393
possibly candida along with it.

480
00:24:39.393 --> 00:24:41.782
We need to always take a look at that.

481
00:24:41.782 --> 00:24:46.115
I have, on my website, detoxification information

482
00:24:46.115 --> 00:24:50.894
as far as a deep cleanse with a variety of herbs

483
00:24:50.894 --> 00:24:53.826
including milk thistle but many other herbs,

484
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:57.794
ginger, turmeric, a number of things that are organic

485
00:24:57.794 --> 00:25:00.377
and wildcrafted that you can take

486
00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:03.201
to detoxify all the filtering organs.

487
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:07.733
If you just detoxify one filtering organ like the liver,

488
00:25:07.733 --> 00:25:10.701
then your kidneys are gonna be kind of upset

489
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:14.594
because they may start having little aches or little pains

490
00:25:14.594 --> 00:25:18.081
because they can't handle all of the toxins coming out.

491
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:21.751
So I developed a system that incorporates

492
00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:25.654
four herbal products to detoxify

493
00:25:25.654 --> 00:25:30.047
all of the filtering organs, the blood, the colon,

494
00:25:31.037 --> 00:25:32.610
the liver, and the kidneys,

495
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.114
and while it strengthens the immune system.

496
00:25:35.114 --> 00:25:39.202
It has some mushrooms in it,

497
00:25:39.202 --> 00:25:41.745
variety of different things that is needed

498
00:25:41.745 --> 00:25:45.625
for each filtering organ so that when you detox,

499
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:49.854
it flows out and nothing

500
00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:52.853
gets redistributed in the bloodstream

501
00:25:52.853 --> 00:25:57.745
because if you don't do it that way, it can be reabsorbed.

502
00:25:57.745 --> 00:26:00.551
If your colon isn't working good, it'll be reabsorbed.

503
00:26:00.551 --> 00:26:02.189
<v Regina>So you need to have a little education</v>

504
00:26:02.189 --> 00:26:03.863
before you go on a detox.

505
00:26:03.863 --> 00:26:07.235
<v ->I think so and we have beautiful instructions</v>

506
00:26:07.235 --> 00:26:10.837
on our website that are designed to help people.

507
00:26:10.837 --> 00:26:11.697
<v Regina>Wonderful.</v>

508
00:26:11.697 --> 00:26:13.104
<v ->Yeah, as well as the diet.</v>

509
00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:17.457
I mean, the diet is very important and organic vegetables,

510
00:26:17.457 --> 00:26:21.244
a lot of vegetables, some fruits,

511
00:26:21.244 --> 00:26:24.787
seeds may be good, some people don't have a good...

512
00:26:25.777 --> 00:26:28.658
Sometimes they don't do very well with nuts

513
00:26:28.658 --> 00:26:30.514
because they have a gallbladder issue

514
00:26:30.514 --> 00:26:33.330
and so those kinds of fats can be a problem.

515
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.396
<v Regina>Right.</v>

516
00:26:34.396 --> 00:26:37.585
You mentioned a little bit ago and we haven't gone

517
00:26:37.585 --> 00:26:40.038
through that part and that is the phytoestrogens

518
00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:42.545
and also the over-the-counter progesterone.

519
00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:44.614
<v ->Right, that's a really good point.</v>

520
00:26:44.614 --> 00:26:45.855
I'm sorry I forgot that.

521
00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:47.587
So we have...

522
00:26:48.651 --> 00:26:49.951
I see this a lot.

523
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:54.240
I had a 36-year-old woman come in whose husband

524
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.918
is a medical doctor and she wanted to get pregnant.

525
00:26:56.918 --> 00:26:58.273
He wanted to get pregnant.

526
00:26:58.273 --> 00:27:01.516
He put her on progesterone creme from the health food store.

527
00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:04.663
Okay, and her progesterone,

528
00:27:04.663 --> 00:27:09.097
instead of it making it normal at 220,

529
00:27:10.497 --> 00:27:12.621
it was 6,650.

530
00:27:12.621 --> 00:27:13.549
<v Regina>Oh!</v>

531
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:15.831
<v ->Now, those are the levels I'm talking about with this.</v>

532
00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:18.726
I'm not talking about five points too high.

533
00:27:18.726 --> 00:27:20.983
<v Regina>Was she just flying and feeling great</v>

534
00:27:20.983 --> 00:27:24.263
or her libido had skyrocketed or what?

535
00:27:24.263 --> 00:27:26.855
<v ->At first, she started feeling a little better</v>

536
00:27:26.855 --> 00:27:30.460
but then, within a couple of months,

537
00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.617
she had anxiety and was nervous

538
00:27:33.617 --> 00:27:38.420
and had some insomnia and was very agitated.

539
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.293
What it actually did was exacerbate

540
00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:45.479
her already-low estrogen

541
00:27:45.479 --> 00:27:48.907
so she had 0.9 estrogen.

542
00:27:48.907 --> 00:27:51.545
No one's gonna get pregnant like that.

543
00:27:51.545 --> 00:27:55.149
So I pointed out to her that stress

544
00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:59.682
was a really big part of why she was not conceiving

545
00:27:59.682 --> 00:28:02.647
and that if you look at the third-world countries

546
00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:05.988
and how they have children

547
00:28:05.988 --> 00:28:08.985
without even good food or good water,

548
00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:12.023
without anything, how they conceive,

549
00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:15.340
that they have a different kind of stress,

550
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.058
they have a survival stress.

551
00:28:17.058 --> 00:28:20.375
She didn't have that kind but she had other kind,

552
00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:22.639
a work-related stress.

553
00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:27.332
Anyway, we got her detoxed from that 6,650

554
00:28:28.302 --> 00:28:32.791
down to 220 and she conceived

555
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:35.223
but more importantly, we brought the estrogen up

556
00:28:35.223 --> 00:28:37.410
and all with homeopathy and diet.

557
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.980
It probably took four or five months.

558
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.921
<v Regina>Now, when you say with homeopathy,</v>

559
00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:43.702
this is one of the other strains of thought

560
00:28:43.702 --> 00:28:47.321
I wanted to follow, and a lot of times

561
00:28:47.321 --> 00:28:50.249
like cures like with homeopathy but you're not necessarily

562
00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:52.730
using hormones to boost hormones

563
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.423
within homeopathy and within the remedies, right?

564
00:28:55.423 --> 00:28:56.145
<v ->Right.</v>

565
00:28:56.145 --> 00:28:57.802
<v Regina>So what are you using?</v>

566
00:28:57.802 --> 00:29:00.150
<v ->Well, we are using</v>

567
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.696
dioscorea, we're using wild jam

568
00:29:04.696 --> 00:29:08.416
in making the homeopathic remedy from that

569
00:29:08.416 --> 00:29:12.357
as well as from cortisol

570
00:29:12.357 --> 00:29:15.207
that is taken from,

571
00:29:15.207 --> 00:29:18.629
and this has been done throughout history in homeopathy,

572
00:29:18.629 --> 00:29:22.944
you can find some of these things in materia medica,

573
00:29:22.944 --> 00:29:26.175
like testosterone is in there, and they take it

574
00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:30.961
from a bull's testicles

575
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:34.096
and they extract it and then they purify it

576
00:29:34.096 --> 00:29:37.510
and then they make it into a homeopathic formula.

577
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.272
So that's the way the hormones are dealt with.

578
00:29:40.272 --> 00:29:44.035
It's called the sarcode

579
00:29:44.035 --> 00:29:48.994
which is from healthy glands of animals.

580
00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:49.961
I never use--

581
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:51.059
<v Regina>Of healthy animals.</v>

582
00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:54.630
<v ->Yes, I never use pigs, I won't have anything</v>

583
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.107
from pigs, really, in my formulas

584
00:29:58.107 --> 00:30:00.777
because there's...

585
00:30:00.777 --> 00:30:03.354
It's just something that I've never really liked

586
00:30:03.354 --> 00:30:07.169
even though they do it in Germany quite a bit

587
00:30:07.169 --> 00:30:10.108
but we don't have German pigs, we have American pigs.

588
00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:11.096
(Regina laughs)

589
00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:13.830
I just don't know about American pigs.

590
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.146
German pigs, they're sacred and they're used for homeopathy.

591
00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:19.843
It's a whole different deal there

592
00:30:19.843 --> 00:30:23.174
when you are making homeopathic remedies.

593
00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:25.828
<v Regina>Most of it bovine then?</v>

594
00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:28.924
<v ->Yeah, so homeopathy is made</v>

595
00:30:28.924 --> 00:30:33.517
from chemicals, heavy metals,

596
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.201
all kinds of toxic things like snake venoms,

597
00:30:41.751 --> 00:30:46.622
very, very interesting remedies even from dog's mother milk,

598
00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:50.391
from human's mother milk,

599
00:30:50.391 --> 00:30:52.674
from herbs, from everything.

600
00:30:52.674 --> 00:30:54.764
And people say...

601
00:30:54.764 --> 00:30:57.186
They wonder about homeopathy saying,

602
00:30:57.186 --> 00:31:00.087
"Okay, so it's all vegetarian, right?"

603
00:31:00.087 --> 00:31:02.807
And I go, "No, no, no."

604
00:31:02.807 --> 00:31:06.401
It's energy medicine, it's the memory or the imprint

605
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:10.401
of the original substance and there's nothing toxic in it.

606
00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:14.936
But you can take arsenic which would kill you

607
00:31:14.936 --> 00:31:18.244
and make a homeopathic remedy and it would cure

608
00:31:18.244 --> 00:31:22.432
the same symptoms that arsenic would cause

609
00:31:22.432 --> 00:31:24.412
if you took it.

610
00:31:24.412 --> 00:31:28.195
So that's the way it works, like cures like.

611
00:31:29.575 --> 00:31:31.313
<v Regina>Okay, so that's what I wanted to know</v>

612
00:31:31.313 --> 00:31:33.192
is what the sources were, is how you get

613
00:31:33.192 --> 00:31:35.495
this like-cures-like with hormones with no hormones.

614
00:31:35.495 --> 00:31:36.968
Well, that makes perfect sense.

615
00:31:36.968 --> 00:31:38.920
<v ->Now the phytoestrogens, I still didn't answer</v>

616
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.556
that question, they're in the health food store

617
00:31:40.556 --> 00:31:43.163
as a cosmetic, as a cosmeceutical.

618
00:31:43.163 --> 00:31:45.787
The progesterone cremes, they're not approved

619
00:31:45.787 --> 00:31:49.695
by the FDA to go for what they're being really used for

620
00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:51.354
and I think that's kind of...

621
00:31:51.354 --> 00:31:54.022
I don't know why it's exactly that way

622
00:31:54.022 --> 00:31:58.306
but it causes, really imbalances in people.

623
00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:02.910
It's not that the body doesn't look at that

624
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.411
as being even biosimilar.

625
00:32:07.731 --> 00:32:09.841
So you have to be careful of these things.

626
00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:12.135
Now saying that, I like maca root.

627
00:32:12.135 --> 00:32:14.342
I think that's really good for people

628
00:32:14.342 --> 00:32:17.544
and if you take it in small amounts--

629
00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:18.803
<v Regina>What's a small amount?</v>

630
00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.798
<v ->Well, depends on each person.</v>

631
00:32:20.798 --> 00:32:24.659
Like a teaspoon or two a few times a week, small amounts.

632
00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:27.283
So sometimes when you say, "I like maca," people go

633
00:32:27.283 --> 00:32:29.204
and take the tablespoons and put it in their smoothie.

634
00:32:29.204 --> 00:32:31.764
<v Regina>Yeah, I'll put like a teaspoon in the smoothie</v>

635
00:32:31.764 --> 00:32:33.184
three times a weeks or so.

636
00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:36.509
<v ->Yeah, you do small amounts of things and you try it</v>

637
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:39.855
that way first to see how your body likes it

638
00:32:39.855 --> 00:32:41.653
and to see if it's biocompatible with you.

639
00:32:41.653 --> 00:32:43.392
<v Regina>And what is the maca doing for us?</v>

640
00:32:43.392 --> 00:32:45.418
<v ->It's helping our testosterone levels,</v>

641
00:32:45.418 --> 00:32:49.247
it's helping with energy, it's very healing,

642
00:32:49.247 --> 00:32:53.651
it also can be very beneficial for some men as well,

643
00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:57.385
and I particularly like it for females.

644
00:32:58.355 --> 00:33:00.467
I mean, there's many, many good things.

645
00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:02.344
I don't recommend eating soy

646
00:33:02.344 --> 00:33:06.549
because of the estrogenic effect of the actual food.

647
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:11.716
And for women who have things

648
00:33:11.716 --> 00:33:16.420
like cysts and fibroids, I have a line

649
00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.779
of homeopathic remedies that not only balance hormones

650
00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:24.747
but can be used for cysts and fibroids

651
00:33:24.747 --> 00:33:27.591
because they have the original homeopathic remedies

652
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:29.656
in them that are used for that.

653
00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:31.932
Now, in my book, Revitalize Your Hormones,

654
00:33:31.932 --> 00:33:35.559
in the back is a 16-page compendium on homeopathy

655
00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:39.176
and it lists individual homeopathic remedies

656
00:33:39.176 --> 00:33:43.893
that are used for female complaints.

657
00:33:43.893 --> 00:33:47.564
Not my remedies because it's a major publisher,

658
00:33:47.564 --> 00:33:49.175
not my formulas.

659
00:33:49.175 --> 00:33:51.995
But it's things like, you can use...

660
00:33:54.252 --> 00:33:56.114
Look at it this way.

661
00:33:56.114 --> 00:33:59.132
If a person has a cyst,

662
00:33:59.132 --> 00:34:02.751
then there are certain remedies that are good for that

663
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:04.593
or if they have a fibroid.

664
00:34:04.593 --> 00:34:06.865
And if they have cancer, there are certain remedies

665
00:34:06.865 --> 00:34:10.929
that are used and those are all in the book.

666
00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:12.395
<v Regina>Okay, excellent.</v>

667
00:34:12.395 --> 00:34:14.036
It looks like a wonderful resource

668
00:34:14.036 --> 00:34:16.767
and it has a little self-test in it along the way, too.

669
00:34:16.767 --> 00:34:19.625
<v ->It has a little self-test and a very large</v>

670
00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:22.625
biological age test

671
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.920
so you can see what your real age is

672
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.939
and that age, in other words, I'll have a woman

673
00:34:27.939 --> 00:34:32.472
who's in her thirties and her biological age will be like 64

674
00:34:32.472 --> 00:34:36.828
because she's smoking or she's drinking too much alcohol

675
00:34:36.828 --> 00:34:39.713
or whatever the reason is.

676
00:34:39.713 --> 00:34:43.638
So you can make your biological age younger

677
00:34:43.638 --> 00:34:46.337
and that is the most important thing.

678
00:34:46.337 --> 00:34:50.327
Chronologically, almost in a way doesn't matter

679
00:34:50.327 --> 00:34:52.855
if you're biologically healthy.

680
00:34:52.855 --> 00:34:54.114
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

681
00:34:54.114 --> 00:34:55.874
Yes, that makes sense.

682
00:34:55.874 --> 00:35:00.471
So let's say we have somebody who is just feeling listless,

683
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:04.466
they've passed through menopause, male or female,

684
00:35:05.516 --> 00:35:09.183
and, say, they've already embraced and taken on

685
00:35:09.183 --> 00:35:12.611
and been on hormones for a few years.

686
00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:17.158
Is it a big transition to transition off of that

687
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:20.763
into the more natural ways of boosting the systems?

688
00:35:20.763 --> 00:35:22.960
<v ->That's a great, great question.</v>

689
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.973
Many people think they have to wean themselves off of it.

690
00:35:28.983 --> 00:35:30.880
I have not seen that.

691
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.447
I've seen, as long as they're stopping them today...

692
00:35:35.447 --> 00:35:37.273
I have to say this legally.

693
00:35:37.273 --> 00:35:39.854
I may not agree with it but I have to say legally

694
00:35:39.854 --> 00:35:41.646
that you have to ask your doctor.

695
00:35:41.646 --> 00:35:42.757
<v Regina>Right.</v>

696
00:35:42.757 --> 00:35:46.980
<v ->But if you have what's gonna help you</v>

697
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.535
and stop it one day, do a detox,

698
00:35:50.535 --> 00:35:53.040
and at the same time with my detox

699
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.401
do the hormone rejuvenation formulas

700
00:35:57.401 --> 00:36:00.643
that you need, you will feel better.

701
00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:01.624
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

702
00:36:01.624 --> 00:36:03.430
So you don't have to worry about that.

703
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.095
<v ->I've never seen that.</v>

704
00:36:05.095 --> 00:36:09.592
If a person doesn't detox and if they stop everything,

705
00:36:09.592 --> 00:36:11.471
and if they don't detox,

706
00:36:11.471 --> 00:36:15.654
if they don't start the formulas right away, possibly.

707
00:36:16.604 --> 00:36:18.416
But as long as you're starting with the formulas

708
00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:22.949
to balance things out and make the ratios

709
00:36:22.949 --> 00:36:27.386
between your progesterone and estrogen balanced,

710
00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:31.409
I actually have a breast and uterine index

711
00:36:31.409 --> 00:36:35.165
on my saliva test which shows how susceptible

712
00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:38.368
the person is to cancer, which is a great thing

713
00:36:38.368 --> 00:36:41.763
because I can see the levels of where they are right now.

714
00:36:41.763 --> 00:36:44.003
Hey, we need to get working on this and this is what

715
00:36:44.003 --> 00:36:47.908
you need to do, we'll do another test and it gets corrected.

716
00:36:47.908 --> 00:36:52.068
But it takes them doing it, it's not a magical thing.

717
00:36:52.068 --> 00:36:53.979
<v Regina>Right, I mean that's true.</v>

718
00:36:53.979 --> 00:36:56.720
In Western culture, we've all been conditioned to look

719
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.621
for magic bullets, the medical industry keeps telling us

720
00:36:59.621 --> 00:37:02.288
when is right around the corner, of course, there isn't one.

721
00:37:02.288 --> 00:37:04.122
Never has been one right around the corner.

722
00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:06.725
Not to say that the discovery of antibiotics

723
00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:09.530
for certain conditions wasn't a real breakthrough,

724
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.349
absolutely, but I mean almost short of that.

725
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:15.886
I know, it's not right to, I don't need to go on about it.

726
00:37:15.886 --> 00:37:16.929
I think most people listening

727
00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:18.913
know what I'm trying to say here.

728
00:37:18.913 --> 00:37:21.910
Now, another thing, you had mentioned this in passing

729
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.491
that you train over 1,000 doctors.

730
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:27.712
Now, are these mostly naturopaths that you're training?

731
00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:30.528
<v ->Medical doctors, chiropractors,</v>

732
00:37:30.528 --> 00:37:35.082
all different types of licensed health providers

733
00:37:36.032 --> 00:37:40.098
and I have a certification that I teach

734
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:46.364
four or five times a year that's state-approved

735
00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:51.226
and they get a certificate and it's action-packed two days.

736
00:37:51.226 --> 00:37:54.404
It's neuroendocrine and anti-aging regulation

737
00:37:54.404 --> 00:37:56.420
and it's also hands-on.

738
00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.724
As much as I believe in saliva testing,

739
00:37:58.724 --> 00:38:01.551
it's not the be-all and end-all because a doctor needs

740
00:38:01.551 --> 00:38:04.923
to put their hand on the patient and test them and use

741
00:38:04.923 --> 00:38:07.220
neurophysical testing which I developed,

742
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.721
and then you can therapy localize and find out

743
00:38:11.721 --> 00:38:14.857
if they have a liver problem,

744
00:38:14.857 --> 00:38:17.577
then you can test to see if the mercury in their mouth

745
00:38:17.577 --> 00:38:20.275
is causing the liver problem, like what's causing it.

746
00:38:20.275 --> 00:38:24.496
So I teach them to therapy localize to find out

747
00:38:24.496 --> 00:38:27.428
what's causing the problem specifically

748
00:38:27.428 --> 00:38:30.518
because if you don't know that, you don't know anything.

749
00:38:30.518 --> 00:38:33.398
You have to find out the specific cause

750
00:38:33.398 --> 00:38:35.627
and through doing the neurophysical testing,

751
00:38:35.627 --> 00:38:37.474
you can do that.

752
00:38:37.474 --> 00:38:40.215
That's what the whole thing is about.

753
00:38:40.215 --> 00:38:43.688
<v Regina>I know you're obviously an extremely busy woman</v>

754
00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.996
in taking people on but a lot of people will hear

755
00:38:45.996 --> 00:38:48.251
this interview, taking people on is not necessarily

756
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:49.889
an option for you because you don't have

757
00:38:49.889 --> 00:38:52.641
that many hours in your year.

758
00:38:52.641 --> 00:38:54.518
But there are people out there, do you have people

759
00:38:54.518 --> 00:38:57.259
that you can recommend that people can go to who have--

760
00:38:57.259 --> 00:39:00.374
<v ->I've trained, as you know, a lot of doctors</v>

761
00:39:00.374 --> 00:39:04.502
and when they've been through my certification,

762
00:39:04.502 --> 00:39:08.014
then I can recommend them wholeheartedly.

763
00:39:10.304 --> 00:39:13.143
Sometimes I go in and out of times

764
00:39:13.143 --> 00:39:17.368
where I have to see people because I love it

765
00:39:18.338 --> 00:39:22.311
and it's really more stressful for me to not see them

766
00:39:22.311 --> 00:39:24.505
than to see them, do you know what I mean?

767
00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:25.263
<v Regina>I do.</v>

768
00:39:25.263 --> 00:39:29.251
<v ->And I have a lot of doctors that need help and they fly in</v>

769
00:39:29.251 --> 00:39:33.315
but the general public, it's kind of difficult to do that

770
00:39:33.315 --> 00:39:37.967
because I don't know them that well at the beginning

771
00:39:37.967 --> 00:39:39.874
so it can be a little bit difficult.

772
00:39:39.874 --> 00:39:41.495
<v Regina>But the point is there are resources.</v>

773
00:39:41.495 --> 00:39:42.382
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Regina>If they go</v>

774
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:44.606
to your website, maybe even email you

775
00:39:44.606 --> 00:39:47.042
and ask for someone that's recommended in their area.

776
00:39:47.042 --> 00:39:49.508
<v ->I have a link called Find a Provider.</v>

777
00:39:49.508 --> 00:39:53.179
<v Regina>Oh, good, and then in the end,</v>

778
00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:55.782
for whoever chooses to educate themselves in advance

779
00:39:55.782 --> 00:39:58.523
so at least they know the questions to ask,

780
00:39:58.523 --> 00:40:02.566
is your book which is Revitalize Your Hormones

781
00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.885
which seems to me, from just thumbing through it

782
00:40:04.885 --> 00:40:06.460
before we started this interview,

783
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.924
looks to me to be a fabulous resource.

784
00:40:08.924 --> 00:40:11.089
<v ->It is and thank you,</v>

785
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:14.134
and it's called Doctor Dale's Seven Steps to a Healthier,

786
00:40:14.134 --> 00:40:17.698
Happier, and Sexier You because when you're feeling better,

787
00:40:17.698 --> 00:40:21.623
you're feeling more like being intimate.

788
00:40:21.623 --> 00:40:23.991
<v Regina>That is true, when you have energy.</v>

789
00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:27.910
<v ->Yeah, and you can even be, in a way,</v>

790
00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.625
much more intimate with yourself

791
00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:37.702
by looking inside and really examining

792
00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:41.045
your belief systems and see what needs to be changed,

793
00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:43.435
what doesn't serve you any longer.

794
00:40:43.435 --> 00:40:46.005
It's harder to do that when you're sick.

795
00:40:46.005 --> 00:40:48.373
Unless your back is up against the wall

796
00:40:48.373 --> 00:40:51.123
and you're really having a difficult challenge

797
00:40:51.123 --> 00:40:53.027
and then you go okay, let me do this real quick,

798
00:40:53.027 --> 00:40:54.428
let me get into this now,

799
00:40:54.428 --> 00:40:56.323
and I've seen just about everything.

800
00:40:56.323 --> 00:41:00.176
I do love working with patients and clients

801
00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:05.326
but they can find that, go through that link on the website.

802
00:41:05.326 --> 00:41:07.576
<v Regina>It's fascinating, I think a lot of people</v>

803
00:41:07.576 --> 00:41:09.625
just want to understand their own bodies better,

804
00:41:09.625 --> 00:41:14.409
their own energy systems better, and the points

805
00:41:14.409 --> 00:41:17.050
you've made about throwing one out of balance by trying

806
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:21.222
to heal another is true in almost every area.

807
00:41:21.222 --> 00:41:25.194
There are so many well-intentioned and wonderful people

808
00:41:25.194 --> 00:41:28.607
out there with wonderful products but what happens

809
00:41:28.607 --> 00:41:31.882
is this balance seems to get thrown off in so many people

810
00:41:31.882 --> 00:41:34.528
that are really trying to help themselves.

811
00:41:34.528 --> 00:41:38.357
<v ->Right, and I think one of the important things to learn</v>

812
00:41:38.357 --> 00:41:40.309
when you want to help yourself, you want to make

813
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:42.452
your life better, happier,

814
00:41:42.452 --> 00:41:44.835
you want to help your friends, your loved ones,

815
00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:49.164
is that supplements are not created equal.

816
00:41:50.214 --> 00:41:52.587
Even though one is very expensive

817
00:41:52.587 --> 00:41:54.100
and the other one is very cheap,

818
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.042
doesn't mean the one that's very expensive is better.

819
00:41:57.042 --> 00:41:59.203
You want to stay away from supplements that have

820
00:41:59.203 --> 00:42:02.603
magnesium stearate in it or any kind

821
00:42:05.293 --> 00:42:10.089
of preservative or any flow agent.

822
00:42:10.089 --> 00:42:13.045
See, magnesium stearate is a flow agent

823
00:42:13.045 --> 00:42:17.877
to get the supplement to flow out of the equipment easily

824
00:42:17.877 --> 00:42:20.194
so it doesn't damage the equipment,

825
00:42:20.194 --> 00:42:22.797
so that it goes and shoots into the capsule.

826
00:42:22.797 --> 00:42:26.487
And I only started really educating myself on this

827
00:42:26.487 --> 00:42:29.527
when I started making my products because I had to deal

828
00:42:29.527 --> 00:42:33.389
in the business world and I had to deal with business people

829
00:42:33.389 --> 00:42:36.312
who were not health providers

830
00:42:36.312 --> 00:42:39.519
and were making supplements.

831
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:44.688
The cost of buying something that's made in China

832
00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:47.237
is one-tenth of what it would cost

833
00:42:47.237 --> 00:42:49.445
if you bought it from the United States.

834
00:42:49.445 --> 00:42:53.349
I don't have any ingredients in my products from China

835
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:56.111
because they contain heavy metals

836
00:42:56.111 --> 00:43:00.787
and actually, any vitamin that has minerals

837
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:04.810
like powders, calcium, if you have a calcium tablet

838
00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:09.322
or calcium liquid and if it contains minerals in it,

839
00:43:09.322 --> 00:43:14.058
it has at least five parts per million of heavy metals,

840
00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:17.641
lead, mercury, cadmium in it.

841
00:43:17.641 --> 00:43:21.002
<v Regina>What about the sea kelp sources, for example?</v>

842
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:23.622
Calcium.

843
00:43:23.622 --> 00:43:27.897
<v ->Calcium from seaweed</v>

844
00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:30.679
and things like that, that's fine

845
00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:33.815
if it's from that or it's ionIc.

846
00:43:33.815 --> 00:43:35.116
<v Regina>If it's ionic, okay.</v>

847
00:43:35.116 --> 00:43:35.865
<v ->If it's ionic.</v>

848
00:43:35.865 --> 00:43:37.976
<v Regina>But just avoid the basic powders.</v>

849
00:43:37.976 --> 00:43:40.835
<v ->All the powders and they're in all kinds of supplements.</v>

850
00:43:40.835 --> 00:43:44.325
You see them and people take too much calcium.

851
00:43:44.325 --> 00:43:46.138
In Germany, when I was studying there,

852
00:43:46.138 --> 00:43:48.271
they would say, "Oh, you got to get those people

853
00:43:48.271 --> 00:43:50.651
"off of that calcium, it makes kidney stones.

854
00:43:50.651 --> 00:43:54.381
"Why do doctors use it?"

855
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:57.904
And it's the truth, I see that they're taking

856
00:43:57.904 --> 00:44:01.662
1,200 mg a day of calcium and then they end up

857
00:44:01.662 --> 00:44:04.213
with a kidney stone, you see?

858
00:44:04.213 --> 00:44:07.444
So you really need to be aware of that

859
00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:11.157
and use clean supplements.

860
00:44:11.157 --> 00:44:13.066
<v Regina>Do you cover some of that in the book?</v>

861
00:44:13.066 --> 00:44:14.156
<v ->A little bit, yes.</v>

862
00:44:14.156 --> 00:44:15.322
<v Regina>Okay, good.</v>

863
00:44:15.322 --> 00:44:17.080
Now what's the problem with magnesium stearate?

864
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.360
What does that do to us?

865
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.077
<v ->It affects the immune system.</v>

866
00:44:20.077 --> 00:44:21.816
It's an immune suppressor.

867
00:44:21.816 --> 00:44:23.693
<v Regina>But that's important for everyone to know</v>

868
00:44:23.693 --> 00:44:25.047
because it's in a lot of stuff.

869
00:44:25.047 --> 00:44:25.806
<v ->It's in everything.</v>

870
00:44:25.806 --> 00:44:27.645
<v Regina>Yeah, I see it on the labels all the time.</v>

871
00:44:27.645 --> 00:44:30.071
<v ->I see it, too, and some people say,</v>

872
00:44:30.071 --> 00:44:32.748
"Oh, mine is vegetarian.

873
00:44:32.748 --> 00:44:34.668
"Okay, mine is vegetarian."

874
00:44:35.658 --> 00:44:37.411
Well, actually,

875
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:45.550
companies that make the products can tell you

876
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.217
that it's from vegetarian source

877
00:44:48.217 --> 00:44:51.630
but they could never prove it to me.

878
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.158
Send me the certificate of analysis and show me

879
00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:56.952
that it's from vegetarian source and show me

880
00:44:56.952 --> 00:45:00.707
the breakdown of the molecular structure of this.

881
00:45:00.707 --> 00:45:04.230
I don't deal with that company because they couldn't show me

882
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.940
so this is the problem, is that you have

883
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.963
to be extremely careful what you put in your body

884
00:45:09.963 --> 00:45:13.931
when you're trying to get well, your body is so sensitive.

885
00:45:13.931 --> 00:45:15.638
<v Regina>Any final thoughts?</v>

886
00:45:16.608 --> 00:45:19.067
<v ->Thank you very much for interviewing me</v>

887
00:45:19.067 --> 00:45:21.271
and giving me an opportunity to share what I do.

888
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:23.351
<v Regina>Absolutely, we'll start getting this information</v>

889
00:45:23.351 --> 00:45:26.391
out there, I can guarantee you that I have a lot

890
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:28.716
of wonderful girlfriends and I'm sure all of them

891
00:45:28.716 --> 00:45:30.975
are going to be reading this book

892
00:45:30.975 --> 00:45:35.524
and many, many thousands more who will be watching this

893
00:45:35.524 --> 00:45:38.869
among our viewing audience that are our CMN friends.

894
00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:42.048
I'm very happy that you've exposed all of us to this

895
00:45:42.048 --> 00:45:45.365
because most of us know someone who is on HRTs

896
00:45:45.365 --> 00:45:48.778
or is contemplating them or has been.

897
00:45:48.778 --> 00:45:49.983
<v ->Right.</v>

898
00:45:49.983 --> 00:45:51.777
<v Regina>And to give us a little clarity</v>

899
00:45:51.777 --> 00:45:53.772
that there are options because it's one

900
00:45:53.772 --> 00:45:57.772
of those double-edged swords where many women and men, too,

901
00:45:57.772 --> 00:46:01.025
a little different spectrum, I understand

902
00:46:01.025 --> 00:46:04.129
it is a little different in dealing with men than women,

903
00:46:04.129 --> 00:46:07.533
quite different, but nonetheless, they really do want

904
00:46:07.533 --> 00:46:09.943
to do something to help themselves toward having

905
00:46:09.943 --> 00:46:12.602
a more vital feeling in their lives and feel like,

906
00:46:12.602 --> 00:46:15.354
oh, my god, I have to deal with the devil and go on the HRT

907
00:46:15.354 --> 00:46:16.643
or something and it's sad.

908
00:46:16.643 --> 00:46:19.875
It's sad to think that there is no other genuine option.

909
00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:22.072
<v ->Right, the only thing I would say, just to wind up,</v>

910
00:46:22.072 --> 00:46:24.675
is that to have hope.

911
00:46:24.675 --> 00:46:28.461
There's no such thing as false hope, there's only hope,

912
00:46:28.461 --> 00:46:32.440
and that you need to really look at your belief systems,

913
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:37.330
look at what you hold in your mind

914
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:41.281
and how still you can make it during the evening or day,

915
00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:43.116
do meditation.

916
00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:46.296
I cannot tell you how many people have benefited

917
00:46:46.296 --> 00:46:50.127
from my book, Transform Your Emotional DNA.

918
00:46:50.127 --> 00:46:53.182
It's a self-help book and I'm gonna give you one.

919
00:46:53.182 --> 00:46:53.936
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

920
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:58.589
<v ->And you can pretty much use the techniques in this.</v>

921
00:46:58.589 --> 00:47:01.268
In Revitalize Your Hormones, there's another technique

922
00:47:01.268 --> 00:47:03.964
for balancing your emotion.

923
00:47:04.854 --> 00:47:07.108
<v Regina>And we were talking off-camera</v>

924
00:47:07.108 --> 00:47:11.087
as Scott was setting up, about the fact that Bruce Lipton

925
00:47:11.087 --> 00:47:13.668
who, many of our viewers hold dear and we do, too,

926
00:47:13.668 --> 00:47:17.990
we adore Bruce, was exposed to your work years ago.

927
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:20.902
<v ->In 1994, right.</v>

928
00:47:20.902 --> 00:47:23.815
Maybe slightly after I came out with it in 1994.

929
00:47:23.815 --> 00:47:27.420
I don't remember the exact date I handed it to him

930
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.296
but it was at a Parker chiropractic convention

931
00:47:30.296 --> 00:47:31.456
where I was lecturing.

932
00:47:31.456 --> 00:47:32.832
<v Regina>And he appreciated it.</v>

933
00:47:32.832 --> 00:47:33.804
<v ->I hope so.</v>

934
00:47:33.804 --> 00:47:35.877
<v Regina>Yeah, good, I hope so, too.</v>

935
00:47:35.877 --> 00:47:37.782
It sounds like it from a lot of the work he's done,

936
00:47:37.782 --> 00:47:40.801
it could've been a source of some of his work

937
00:47:40.801 --> 00:47:42.443
but we won't speculate on that.

938
00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:43.828
I'm just glad you handed him one.

939
00:47:43.828 --> 00:47:44.537
(Theresa laughs)

940
00:47:44.537 --> 00:47:46.402
Well, thank you so much, Theresa,

941
00:47:46.402 --> 00:47:49.062
and I look forward to reading both these books.

942
00:47:49.062 --> 00:47:49.971
<v ->Thank you.</v>

943
00:47:50.802 --> 00:47:52.464
<v ->To learn more about this safe form</v>

944
00:47:52.464 --> 00:47:55.630
of hormone revitalization, you can visit Theresa's website

945
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.561
at wellnesscenter.net.

946
00:47:57.561 --> 00:48:00.483
I find this a total breath of fresh air on the subject

947
00:48:00.483 --> 00:48:03.363
that has carried loads of angst for decades now.

948
00:48:03.363 --> 00:48:06.291
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
