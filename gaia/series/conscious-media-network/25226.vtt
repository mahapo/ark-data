00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Patricia Albere has
been helping people get out

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:84%
of their own way for
over three decades.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
At age 23, she was facilitating
groups for a new movement

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
under Werner Erhard,
that was later

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:84%
to be known as EST.
What struck her

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
so deeply during
those developing years

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:84%
was how beautiful life can be
if we simply commit to sharing

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:90%
the truth moment by moment.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, truth has
consequences that they believe

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:90%
outweigh living authentically.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
In this interview, Patricia
explains that we literally

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
have nothing of genuine value
to lose if we commit to truth,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:90%
which always gives way to love.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.092 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Patricia, I think
this is something

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
that almost everybody
watching in our audience here

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:90%
can relate to.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is to go to a higher
level in our relationships

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and communications
with each other.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The old ways, and the
will, and the ego,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and the status
positions that people

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:84%
have been working from
throughout history, really,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:90%
are dying away.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not proving to
be satisfying anymore.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And you are presenting
something to the world

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
called evolutionary
relationships, which

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I think is fabulous.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But also, this would mean
evolutionary communication,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.307 align:middle line:90%
it seems to me.

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so let's start
out, first of all,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
talking about personal
relationships, one on one.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll expand it
out to the business world.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But what is your definition of
an evolutionary relationship?

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:84%
First of all, evolutionary
and relationship

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
actually is, in a way, the
same thing, believe it or not.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So to evolve means to be going
to higher and higher and higher

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
evolution does.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And evolving in the world
of time, form, and distance

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:90%
is to be in relationship.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you are evolving,
if you are awakening

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
into the absolute,
into the place that's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
timeless and formless and
you're at one with the universe,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:90%
there's no relationship.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no beloved.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.738 align:middle line:84%
So the world is really God's
opportunity to create relating.

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
there's the beloved.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:90%
There's you and me.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So this higher form
has to do with,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
first of all, that it's not just
about the normal things that

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:90%
are not wrong.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
You transcend and
include in evolution.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So you include living
together if it's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:90%
a personal relationship.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to take
out the garbage?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Having children, going to
the movies, all the things

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
that we enjoy as
humans doing together.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But the purpose of it is
from a place of awakening.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It's from a place
of what's possible,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:84%
like if you and I could be on
the edge of where we don't know

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
what could happen in this
energy and space between us,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of we're
comfortably in this way

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:90%
of being with one another.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.612 align:middle line:90%
We have sex, we--

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
not you and I, but you know--

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --partnership.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything is done
by rote, by habit, even,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and up until now, pretty much.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is really-- this
almost requires a breaking down

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
of roles, as they've
been traditionally viewed

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way, doesn't it?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it does.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop there.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a problem of having
certain ways that we relate,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
but that's not really
what we're trafficking in.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a stability.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that we're used to.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
That's something where
we know who's doing what.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But then the real place
that we're relating in

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
is that we're discovering
what happens between us when

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:90%
you're not fixated there.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.952 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not fixated here
in a particular way.

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm not coming from the past.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And you don't look like my
father and all the things

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that the ego comes
up with, which

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:90%
is all some fixed way of being.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So there are methods that we
use to get people to the place

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually
start to not know

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
what can actually happen
in the exchange between us.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.792 align:middle line:84%
And that's scary
for a lot of people.

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:24.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people really want
to be able to control outcomes

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and have a pretty good idea of
where things are going so that

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
they can engineer
it that direction.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.317 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you work
with a lot of people.

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
your press materials.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with
over 150,000 people.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.665 align:middle line:90%
That's a long career.

00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:39.465 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people.

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of people.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And would you say--

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
they're working with you,

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
do this breakthrough.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But how would you
characterize this stuckness

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that we have in needing
to control an outcome

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
or have an expected outcome and
breaking our addiction to that?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
developmentally,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
work is appropriate.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of your shows,
a lot of your work

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.095 align:middle line:90%
speaks to people on the edge.

00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot
of your audience

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
are people that are not just the
normal people that are watching

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:90%
whatever on television.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they just--

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Reruns of Archie Bunker.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not where they are.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is a developmental--
this isn't for everybody.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It really isn't.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that in
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
there are certain places
where you need to get to.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Actualization is
at the top where

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel
this pressure, and you

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
start to feel this feeling
of like, I don't know why.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:90%
My life is pretty OK.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And things are good, but
I want to express myself.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.658 align:middle line:90%
I want something more.

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
I want something more.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to crawl
out of the box.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I want something.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's when this
evolutionary force, this

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
starts to move into you.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And then it naturally goes, huh!

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, what
can I do with you?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just me by myself.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It almost always takes me into
an expression in the world

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and in between.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%
What can happen between us?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
What can happen?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, once you
open up those doors,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.483 align:middle line:84%
then you want to be able to walk
through them and express them

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
in a myriad number
of ways, right?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is with
another, and it's not just

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:90%
with any other.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's with somebody else who
has that same, I don't know.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:90%
What could we do?

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
What could we create together?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Where could love go?

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Where could our
psychic abilities go?

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Where could these
multi-dimensional capacities

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that we've heard
human beings have--

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:90%
where are they?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And how could we
develop those things?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond survival.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It goes beyond
what's predictable.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It goes beyond what
you can count on.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's actually interested in--

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:90%
what's it called?

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I find in the work
that we do in the online stuff

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and in the live
stuff, you're building

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.513 align:middle line:84%
a rocket that can pull away
from the gravity of the Earth.

00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And there's a gravity.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's oriented
toward expansion,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:90%
just expansion and growth.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And once you get-- and
the gravity is our survival

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:90%
in relationship, our basic--

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
like, I need you.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I need to belong.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.752 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to call me?

00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you like me?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Did I say it right?

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all that
stuff is just so--

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.185 align:middle line:90%
>> All those excruciatingly--

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:20.985 align:middle line:90%
>> --exhausting.

00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --painful, exhausting things.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a place where you
don't have to resolve all that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very human.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And what are you going to do?

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But when we're
together and you start

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to open up this other
possibility, that falls away.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a place of
beingness that--

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.883 align:middle line:90%
It isn't there.

00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has
experienced that.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's ever been
in a group situation

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
or related to someone who
really saw them, who really was

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
safe and really saw
them in some deeper way

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.303 align:middle line:84%
where all your
insecurity falls way.

00:07:54.303 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, you feel

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:90%
like you're called to play.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you're like,
somebody wants me to play.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like we spend all this
time as we mature in life,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:10%
throwing up more or putting
on more clothing, so to speak,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:10%
to essentially groom our
image in the world so that

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:10%
we're perceived
in a certain way,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:10%
a lot of it egoic structures.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying is
when we get to the point

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:90%
where that's just not working--

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.298 align:middle line:84%
it's limited, it's
unsatisfying--

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
you want to start stripping
off all that clothing

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and be seen for
who you truly are.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, that brings me
to something else.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Your background--
before you created

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:84%
this area of your work,
this new area, is you

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
were 12 years with
Werner Erhard, which was

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:90%
EST, Landmark, and so forth.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that
knows about it, probably

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
has a perception of
what Landmark is.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
have done Landmark.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
I don't want to.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be part of it.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But for you, just
digging down here,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
what is it that having such a
deep involvement with Landmark

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:03.425 align:middle line:84%
brought to your level of
your personal evolution?

00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I think a couple things.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
One was I love being where
things are starting, OK?

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:90%
So I have a Forrest Gump type.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I wander into where
something has just started.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:90%
So Werner in 1971--

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:84%
it was before EST. It
was way before Landmark.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I left, but Landmark.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning of something
when it's just beginning,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.538 align:middle line:84%
there is an emergent quality
that's really exciting,

00:09:35.538 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
which is the same as
what I'm teaching now.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
This is where I think
consciousness is emerging,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
is on this collective,
relational level, right?

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So back then,
personal transformation.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you would say
transformation to people,

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
people would go
like, a butterfly?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, nobody had a clue.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't part
of our vocabulary.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> If you knew about Esalen.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And then some people
went to India.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, nothing
was going on in this country.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.482 align:middle line:90%
It was a wasteland.

00:10:05.482 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's
millions of people

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:90%
teaching a million things.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So the personal transformation
that was elemental in that

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
was so exciting.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And we had all the
important people

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
on the planet wanting to be
a part of what we were doing.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody
was a part of it.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was so young.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was so empowered.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't even understand
that being a 23-year-old,

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that I shouldn't have been
doing what I was doing.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't care.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Because basically, if
you produced results

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.315 align:middle line:84%
and if you were
effective with people,

00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:90%
you were given that chance.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So I was leading
groups back then.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think the opportunity
to be with groups of people

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and to be a part of
a group of people

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that were in an emergent state
was really the beginning.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
these pioneering,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:56.864 align:middle line:84%
wild, committed, devoted
bhakti types, right?

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:57.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:57.664 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.508 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That we had to be effective.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So we were being really
trained to be very effective.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
That shaped me enormously.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And it also gave me a chance.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you know
that teach or that are coaches?

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Or even at Britain
multi-best-selling books,

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, et
cetera, have worked

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
with thousands and thousands
of people in groups in depth.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:90%
That's not just like a talk.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actually taking
people from point A to point--

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this stripping down--

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> --Z.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.703 align:middle line:84%
>> --process we were talking
about, to be stripped down,

00:11:28.703 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to be seen for
who you truly are,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you must have facilitated
thousands upon--

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> --thousands of those.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was such a grace.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, such a gift
and to be with him.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was--

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were with--

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, so many people--

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Lynne Twist.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many
people were a part

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
of that at the
beginning that are still

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:84%
making a difference, that are
still enormously impacting

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the world with The
Hunger Project,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and Breakthrough Foundation,
and various things.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.245 align:middle line:84%
So whatever people
thought about--

00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't go
to the bathroom.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't know what the media
took on, which was bizarre.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But the impact culturally
on the planet is huge.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so to be a part of that in
the beginning was, I guess--

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's who I am.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, it makes sense.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's who I am.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You were in such
formative years.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, to have that--

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> 18 to 30.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> To discover that power inside
yourself at those ages between

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:90%
18 and 30, as you say, was huge.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So once you learned that
vulnerable is good and you

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:90%
started--

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Truth is good.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And truth is good.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And you started exploring
to higher levels.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:90%
That brings us up to age 30.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
How did you start
applying it after that?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Because this has been an
evolutionary journey for you.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:10%
I've been driven in this way.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, first the truth.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:84%
For me, truth and
intimacy are the same.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
When you get very close,
if you care deeply

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
about being really
close to what's there,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:90%
then you're intimate.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only kind
of intimacy that's valid.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.057 align:middle line:84%
>> And describe-- give us
your definition of intimacy.

00:13:08.057 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds like
it's a much broader--

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't just mean
a sexual relationship.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about what
intimacy in that context really

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Intimacy means this attuned--

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:84%
that you've developed your
capacity and your love.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And you've gotten past
a lot of the fear.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Or you're willing
to go past the fear

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
each time of getting so close
to what's real, what's true.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
On every level, what do
you feel in your body?

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel in your heart?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
What are you
sensing is happening

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:84%
in the field, your psychic
sense, your intuitive

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:90%
sense of what the truth is?

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is complete
intimacy with the moment,

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, and
with existence.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm there, and I'm willing
to totally be there with you,

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and you're there with
me, we're there with--

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:90%
it's almost awe.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:10%
You're listening for and
feeling into what's really here

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:10%
and even if it's a
moment of flatness.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're in
love with somebody,

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and you feel this dead zone.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:90%
But you're not afraid of that.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
You go, wow, we're
in a dead zone.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.312 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:14:21.312 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And being curious and open.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Somehow when you're
intimate in that way,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary force
keeps moving things along.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.198 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to manipulate.

00:14:33.198 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to decide
where we need to go,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
or what it means, or
all the other nonsense

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:90%
that our egos do.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:90%
So for me, that's intimacy.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually one of
the key things that I teach,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.587 align:middle line:84%
which is the source of a simple
way to allow life to move.

00:14:50.587 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you have to
have the five steps to this

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%
and the three techniques for--

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's exhausting.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I mean, I've
learned a million things.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's too complicated.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not at the core of how we
could actually navigate life

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And what you're saying
makes perfect sense.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:90%
You listen.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
You think, well, of course,
just to speak from the heart

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and be absolutely aware
and honest in the moment,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:90%
yet people have fears.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Terrified.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>> They're afraid of losing
whatever it is they have.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
whatever security

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
they may have built in
a relationship or even

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
among friends or co-workers,
that if they're honest,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
they're going to lose that
position and everything that

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:90%
comes with it.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, you're right.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a point
of development.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.532 align:middle line:84%
David Hawkins, who I'm sure
you're probably aware of,

00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
well, one of his
best book, I think,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is "Transcending the
Levels of Consciousness."

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.093 align:middle line:84%
And what he speaks about
is that there's a--

00:15:50.093 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:84%
he does the muscle
testing, which people

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
have various relationship
to, whether they believe that

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, the calibration.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter to me--

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:90%
is you can feel it.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:84%
When you're around
certain people,

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:84%
you feel uplifted
during and after.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are other people--
you're just exhausted.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:90%
You're just exhausted.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.263 align:middle line:84%
You're just you're
finished being with them.

00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
like, oh, my God.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
I have to recover.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So what he says is that 200
is the place where above that,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:90%
you're actually energized.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And below that, if
people are identified

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
with certain emotional states
as a core way of being.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is on a
scale of 0 to 1,000.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So 1,000 is Christ
Consciousness.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
So 200 isn't--

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not an
overwhelming burden

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.795 align:middle line:90%
in terms of reaching that level.

00:16:38.795 --> 00:16:39.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:90%
You think, right?

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you think.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just basically
not draining you.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So 200--
interestingly enough,

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:90%
pride is just under 200.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And pride is something we
all have to pay attention to,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
which is where you identify
with your self-image.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
You identify with,
I already know that.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm familiar with that.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'm this.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm that.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:90%
And I know.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know, I know, I
know, I know, right?

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.777 align:middle line:84%
Which is we're not a
million miles from that.

00:17:04.777 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:90%
So it's very easy to go there--

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> --on any level.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You can be spiritually
identified with that, just as

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:90%
easy as anything else.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, you can even
transcend that level with one

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
person and then drop right
back into that with another,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether they
trigger certain things in you.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so pride
is the "I know."

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's around 150 to 200.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.776 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're identified
with your self-image.

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're identified
with, this is who I am.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I've spent my whole life.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I've done.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I know.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I've learned.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> But you're putting yourself--

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are the
books I've written.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.255 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I branded
and all the rest of it, right?

00:17:38.255 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're creating
your little box.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:90%
But you're under 200.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
You're not open.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Where you move up is courage.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:90%
And courage is always courage.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So courage is always
courage to you or to me.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we've expanded, and
done things, and been scared,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and did it a million times.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:90%
It's still courage.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So no matter where
you are, you have

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:90%
to actually still have courage.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> You're never done with that.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And then that takes you
into the higher levels.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Underneath 200-- you
don't tell the truth.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You're not interested
in the truth.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:90%
You're manipulating for gain.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
You're manipulating for
gain and survival, period.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:90%
So you aren't interested.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.252 align:middle line:90%
And you won't.

00:18:24.252 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who's operating
from pride and below into fear

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:84%
states, and anger, and other
things that are despair,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:38.015 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, you cannot count on
that person to be in the truth.

00:18:38.015 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Because they're too scared.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:90%
They're too much in survival.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But the big news is,
you actually have to.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
To go to the higher levels, to
have what I'm talking about,

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
one of the prices that needs
to be paid continuously

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
is you need to learn how
to really be in the truth

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and to have the
courage to do that.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.618 align:middle line:90%
And there's no way around it.

00:18:57.618 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no easy fix.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, this
isn't for everybody.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people go, I
don't want to pay that price.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- I need to
manipulate my life.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if I don't,
what would happen?

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>> And manipulate others.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And it can result in such an
incredible deadening effect.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Dead, but it looks
"like it's safe."

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I
work with people--

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very, very supportive,
but also very challenging.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm from New York,
so just a certain--

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I have permission
to be that way.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And what do you got to lose?

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
If you really look at
most people's lives

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:90%
and they're going, no, I can't.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
You're like, really?

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it that amazing?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you really have
such an extraordinary life,

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:90%
holding onto everything?

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:90%
You got to be kidding.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see variances
with the sexes?

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, would you find
that a woman's need to control

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.455 align:middle line:90%
might be more security oriented?

00:19:58.455 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, it certainly,
probably more

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
in the past than the
current generations

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
where a man's need
to control might

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:90%
come from a different area?

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Can you look at it via gender?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's different.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I'm teaching

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
in the course about
evolutionary relationships

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
is that there are survival
instincts, that we have

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
different ones that are strong.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And so where you
control is which

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.998 align:middle line:90%
instinct is the strongest.

00:20:26.998 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually going to do
some teaching around that.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a long conversation.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But basically, all
animals, which includes us,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
we have self-preservation
as an instinct

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
so that would be being safe,
and having money, and having

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
a home and the right clothes.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And right now, seems
like that's a big one.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, self-preservation
is strong in some people.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The social instinct
is stronger in others,

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
so their sense of belonging,
and how they're seen,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not they
are the important one,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and whether they're
connected to their families.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're on Facebook.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's a certain
survival around

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:90%
their social connections.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:90%
That's more--

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it makes sense.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --core.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
They have to have that.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
The self-preservation part--
they cannot have insurance.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
They can forget to eat.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:90%
They not as strong.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But you need to have
your friendship intact.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:90%
That's core.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's survival.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
higher or better.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just survival.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the other type
is the sexual instinct.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And the sexual instinct
isn't sex as much

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
as it is an intimacy
intensity and chemistry.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if things aren't
exciting or inspiring,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:90%
you just can't stand it.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%
You'll leave security.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.613 align:middle line:90%
You'll leave.

00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't care what other
people think as long as you have

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:90%
this intensity in your life.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.803 align:middle line:90%
And that's core.

00:21:50.803 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you
work with people,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
are you helping them identify
which of those values is

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:90%
their strongest value?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:57.425 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:57.425 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, obviously, you
must rewind with them where

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that's become dysfunctional and
essentially falling under that

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:90%
200 threshold for--

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.358 align:middle line:84%
on some level,
they're on survival.

00:22:07.358 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>> They will sell out for that.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>> They'll sell out for that?

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's complicated.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like most
things that are real

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and where you have
some lasting change

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
is there's different
elements that

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
need to be addressed in order
to get the rocket ship up,

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
off the Earth.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So one of them is this.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Because those survival
things-- if you think about it

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
in a monastery, they
take away those things

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
so that you have the
energy to have lift-off.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.262 align:middle line:90%
>> So you wear the same thing.

00:22:36.262 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:90%
You eat the same stuff.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
You have a little room.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.478 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to
do social talking.

00:22:40.478 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're definitely
not having sex.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, having said that--

00:22:43.103 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have energy
for other things.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're not worrying about
where your next meal is coming

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have a
bed to sleep in.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All the basics are covered.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're released from a
certain amount of obsessing

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:84%
over those things, which those
of us that are secular that are

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.120 align:middle line:90%
we get lost in those things.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Martha Stewart would be like
the ultimate self-preservation,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
how to do everything more and
more perfectly and just being

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
completely lost in that.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So people control in a place
that they are the most gripped.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
poke at that and get

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
people to start to look
so that they can have

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:90%
some energy for something else.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that happened
in your life, as I recall,

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:90%
was about the age of 33 or so.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:84%
You fell very deeply
in love with someone.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:90%
And I start to say sadly.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But the way it went
was that he wasn't

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
in your life for
a very long time.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Five years or so?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We were together four years--

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Four years?

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> --and then he died.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But this took you to an entirely
new level of depth and inquiry.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
what happened there--

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was profound.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>> --and what that brought to
you and your understanding that

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.665 align:middle line:90%
you're sharing with others?

00:23:56.665 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
After EST and all the work
there, then having my son,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
which is, as you know, a
whole journey in itself.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A whole love
affair in itself.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> A whole newness.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Your son and my son are
only months apart in age.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Then I met Peter.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And Peter was a mystic, so he's
deeply spiritual, completely,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and then incredibly
handsome and sexy

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and just had that whole
energy of falling in love,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:90%
but it was bigger than that.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Given who I was and given
who he was when we met,

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
we weren't two normal people
falling in love at all.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You had both done a lot
of work already on yourself.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And he was so--

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:90%
he had been to India.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:90%
And he was just--

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he wouldn't--
he walked meditatively.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd be like,
what are you doing?

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And he would just be--

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:84%
he just was so deep
and so present.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.287 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow--

00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> But was that an attractive--?

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> --who are you?

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you attracted to that
because there was something you

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:02.390 align:middle line:84%
knew was really
going to push you?

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I just--

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know what it was.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I was just very fascinated.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:90%
And we fell in love.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And we started-- because of
the nature of our commitment,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.542 align:middle line:90%
we're both very--

00:25:16.542 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
was it passionate about the
opening of what's possible,

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:84%
what's possible,
what's possible?

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:90%
We loved going into the unknown.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredible to be met
there, to have somebody else

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:90%
who wanted to play like that.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.395 align:middle line:90%
Because that's rare.

00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Almost nobody-- everybody
is a speed bump.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Most people are like, let's
just go this fast and not this.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was grateful
that he was like that.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
I discovered with him.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Besides having this
extraordinary experience

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of non-stop, it
just kept opening.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:90%
We were shown.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
We were taken.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we just--
every day we were like,

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, it's possible.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's possible.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't trying to
control the relationship.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were staying in
that really intimate place

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.428 align:middle line:90%
of what's real right now.

00:26:08.428 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's real right now
might not look like it did

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:90%
a few months before.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It kept changing.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:90%
But the depth.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I felt it.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:90%
I felt us to have lift-off.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
At one point, we worked
through a certain amount

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of our own fears and,
oh, my God and all that.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And stuff started to happen
that was off the charts.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:90%
We were awakening.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
We were having a spiritual
awakening together.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was happening
simultaneously.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
We were in the same
states together.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:90%
There was no separation.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.028 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would go,
do you feel that?

00:26:42.028 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And he'd go, yeah.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd spend the
entire day in some place,

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:90%
like we were wandering.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like we were on
drugs, but we weren't,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
which was extraordinary.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.817 align:middle line:84%
And then something
else would happen.

00:26:53.817 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And something else would happen.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So I found that there was
a way we were oriented,

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that we were turned towards
life in a certain way

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
towards each other
that was allowing

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.050 align:middle line:84%
for the newness of what could
happen with love, and with joy,

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and ecstasy, and creativity.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, if there is
a God, he was having a blast.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just like, wow,
we've got these two people.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're open.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And they're not in the way.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we can have something
really happen with these guys.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I felt we were taken
places that people had never

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:90%
been before.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel-- it
felt like new territory.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And I felt the blessing.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I felt we were actually--

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
we were giving something,
just in the pure beauty

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and joy of where we were.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Of being so spontaneously
open to creation.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Two different dimensions
of evolution and love

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and profundity, that I feel that
the creation wanted to see what

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:90%
could happen.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, human beings
are never available.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We're just so busy
with stupid stuff.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that sad?

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially since you've
been there all the way.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And over time.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a moment.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was we sustained a
level that kept going places.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.727 align:middle line:84%
>> And see, that's
the interesting part.

00:28:18.727 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact, you
mentioned something earlier.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about the beginning

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
of EST. When things are fresh
and new, you stumble into them.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And I just interviewed a
man named Jonathan Schooler.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And he is a scientist who is--

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:84%
there's something
he's been documenting

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in his research of late
called the decline effect.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it sparked
that remembrance

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
of that conversation with him
and me when you said that.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it has to do
with something happens

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:56.705 align:middle line:84%
in the newness of a moment
that cannot be replicated.

00:28:56.705 --> 00:28:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is how-- he
was doing other research

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and found out as they kept
replicating the experiment,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
they kept getting
a reduced effect.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is true of drugs.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:90%
It's true of a lot of things.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they're trying to come
to the point of understanding

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
what fundamental thing is at
play that creates this decline

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:90%
effect?

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I could have a
whole different conversation

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:90%
about that, that has--

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>> --little to do with
classic science, anyway.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I bring
it up is because what

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like is you--

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.243 align:middle line:84%
and what was your
husband's name?

00:29:29.243 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>> We weren't married.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Your relation to--

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Peter.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Your love's name.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Peter.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
You and Peter-- it sounds like
you were able, in the moment,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to always have
new moments by not

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:84%
attaching to these identities
of the past moment.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:90%
And so you're--

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's part
of what I'm teaching.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You didn't have
that decline effect,

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
which almost every relationship,
friendship, otherwise--

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter--

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:90%
has this decline effect.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you get
stuck in these roles.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And you never really
go anywhere beyond.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And you reify.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Reify means you mentally start
making constructs around it

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.360 align:middle line:84%
so that you go-- so
you can understand it.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Or, I mean, that
there are tendencies

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that most spiritual
teachers understand, too,

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:90%
with certain experiences.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:84%
As soon as people
have had a satori,

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:84%
they can't get there
for another 10 years,

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:90%
because they reify it.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And they attach to it.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:90%
And they do all kinds of stuff.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.717 align:middle line:84%
>> I got there
this way last time.

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'll go again.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we seem to be--
there's something in human

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.560 align:middle line:84%
nature that has this little fear
at the base that seems to drive

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:90%
us toward that behavior.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So how do you work
with people that--

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
how, for example,
would you help them

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
blast past that in
an intimate situation

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:90%
where they just need--

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:84%
there's fear on both sides,
because they don't want

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:90%
to let go of that core thing.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, the secret
we had, which was so simple,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
which is what we
spoke of before,

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
was there are 10 different
dimensions of mutuality,

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:84%
which is part of what I
teach, which is different,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:90%
the ways we were oriented, OK?

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Which you're not--
it's simple, but it's

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:84%
hard to get yourself aligned
in a different way as a human

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is this
love for the truth.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's say he was afraid, and
I was afraid at some moment.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Or he was just afraid.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:84%
If we are staying intimate,
if our primary commitment,

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:84%
no matter what, is to
stay real, and we're not--

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> To stay in truth.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> We've committed to that.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.313 align:middle line:84%
It's not an option
to go, well, I

00:31:32.313 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:84%
don't really want
to say anything,

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.855 align:middle line:90%
because I will disturb him.

00:31:34.855 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And then what'll that
do to the relationship?

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the stuff that
people come up with.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So the moment
something is happening,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
he would then
track that with me.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, yeah,
I'm feeling fear.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
a stupid example.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We were in the grocery
store in New York.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And we were really
happy before we went in.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:90%
We were shopping.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:90%
And he's German.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.240 align:middle line:90%
He was German.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
his energy changed.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
We got to the cash
register and checked out.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.990 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, ooh.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.705 align:middle line:90%
I mean, his energy shut down.

00:32:03.705 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we got back
out in the street.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.788 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
so what happened?

00:32:06.788 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, there was
this woman on the line.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.344 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, you dress
so much like an American.

00:32:15.344 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
started judging you.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Because he could tell
she was European.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
She had a different way of
putting things together.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
it popped open again.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is stupid.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
silly little thing.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:90%
But it was so--

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.240 align:middle line:84%
the whole evening would have
gone in a different direction

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:90%
that one moment.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.703 align:middle line:90%
Because we were so close.

00:32:33.703 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And this happens to
all of us all day long.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> This is always going on.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's shut down
more and more.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:90%
No, don't say that.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:90%
No, don't rock the boat.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But you're right, just to
acknowledge something that is--

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it
didn't mean anything.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> --healing.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, then we both laughed.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, you're right.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I do dress like an American.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.962 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:32:51.962 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
He just laughed, and picked me
up, and kissed me or something.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, OK.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was his own judgment
that was shutting him down.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he felt bad.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
He felt bad that he
likes that better.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:90%
So the tracking, the learning.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how do you
really get deep enough

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.233 align:middle line:84%
to feel into the reality
of the moment, all of it?

00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Because most the time,
you're so disconnected,

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.233 align:middle line:84%
you don't even know that
you're having a judgment.

00:33:18.233 --> 00:33:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It happens in a split
second, and it's gone.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So learning together that
you want to learn that skill

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and that that will actually
be the lifeline of aliveness

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:37.062 align:middle line:84%
and the newness actually
happened through that.

00:33:37.062 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And it has to also--

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so simple.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> --require a pretty high
self-esteem and degree

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:90%
of self-esteem.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.250 align:middle line:84%
If you feel that you
don't have enough value

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in a given relationship
to bring to the table

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.895 align:middle line:84%
that truth is going to
knock you out of that game--

00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:51.312 align:middle line:84%
>> That knock you
out of the game.

00:33:51.312 --> 00:33:52.138 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:53.042 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:53.042 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> --which a lot of
people feel that way.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it can't--

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:90%
it's an egoless relationship.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So what you have
to be interested in

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is whatever identities
you've attached yourself to,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.500 align:middle line:84%
that you actually want
the truth and the love

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:90%
to take those apart.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.114 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not
who you are, anyway.

00:34:11.114 --> 00:34:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
security in an ego.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:84%
You will never be
safe and secure.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
You will never feel
like, OK, I'm good.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:90%
It's always anxiety ridden.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:90%
So why not find out?

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Why not take those
things apart together so

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
connect in a place that

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:90%
really is for real?

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And part of what--
and now, I don't

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.462 align:middle line:84%
know if this is part of the
10 dimensions of relationship

00:34:36.462 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:90%
you were talking about.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:41.315 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed-- I was
reading somewhere that you--

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:42.570 align:middle line:90%
and correct me if I'm wrong--

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --utilize Enneagram
as part of this.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:90%
>> I have 10 years' knowledge.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I created an
Enneagram mastery program

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:90%
and worked with people.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
introduce it later.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's not part of right
now, the 10 dimensions

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about?

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But while you're on
it for just a second,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.890 align:middle line:84%
since we did interview Dr.
Daniels on this as well,

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.830 align:middle line:84%
do you care to speak to how
that plays into this when

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to get to raw
truths and you have typologies

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that are, say, very compatible
or not too compatible?

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The typologies aren't
compatible or not.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
level of consciousness.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, that makes sense.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:84%
If you're at a high
level of any one of them,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:90%
you can break through.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you're at
that middle range

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
or so that most people succumb
to, the traditional traits.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, maybe.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so interested in trying
to have egos fit together well.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but I just saw
that Enneagram on there.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.257 align:middle line:84%
So that's not
really part of this?

00:35:40.257 --> 00:35:41.057 align:middle line:90%
>> No--

00:35:41.057 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> But later on--

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> --but later.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> --weave it in.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.097 align:middle line:90%
>> --here's the thing.

00:35:44.097 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:84%
My experience with
the Enneagram is

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's a very subtle
teaching if used correctly.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And so if you really
want to wake up,

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.402 align:middle line:84%
there are things that are
just glued to your face

00:35:55.402 --> 00:35:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that you just think,
oh, that's me.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize that it's
an automatic structure that's

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:90%
actually coming through.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.238 align:middle line:84%
So later, when people are very
awake to that sense of truth,

00:36:08.238 --> 00:36:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and really feeling into
things, and they're

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:84%
getting very good at that, then
it's safe to introduce that.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Because then they
can use it correctly

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
without laying it
over their experience.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So you really have to have
some self-awareness before that

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:90%
becomes genuinely useful.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's a
good point to make.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I found.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen
that people can use it

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:84%
in a way that actually puts
them a little farther away,

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:90%
instead of a little bit closer.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I could see
the potential in that.

00:36:36.902 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And let's shift from personal
relationships to the workplace,

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
because you work across
the spectrum on this.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is important.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Because many businesses, such
as businesses that people

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
watching this may be
participating in or even

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:84%
creating, are really
trying to birth

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.950 align:middle line:84%
themselves at a higher
level of consciousness.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you're still dealing with
the fundamental survival--

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> People.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> --issues.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you've got people.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And then you have your business.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's a business,
is theoretically there

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to make a profit of some kind.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you work
with people on that level

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
where there may be
this one super core

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.080 align:middle line:84%
issue that's always
there, is, how do we

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.200 align:middle line:90%
do this and make a profit?

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they'd have
to have included--

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:84%
see this is a way of
relating by agreement,

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.970 align:middle line:84%
so you can't just do
this with anybody.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So your business had better
have partners who are really

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.983 align:middle line:84%
on board with the
higher directive.

00:37:35.983 --> 00:37:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> You'd have to understand.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:84%
What is an evolutionary
relationship?

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.460 align:middle line:90%
What's possible here?

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And do we want to take that
on as a part of our ability

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to take our business
to another level?

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to do with
the practical collaborative

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are incredible people
in the business world now

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that are working with holacracy,
and tribal leadership,

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and all these really
cool things that

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
are really good at taking
people to higher levels,

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:90%
just on a basic business level.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
This would be if you
had a group of people,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
particularly that want
to be creative together.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And egos always get in the way
of creativity, unfortunately.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And when it's not
there, that's when

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.313 align:middle line:90%
these amazing things happen.

00:38:19.313 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You get a collective
of people that just

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:90%
do something extraordinary.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The people get so
attached to the juice.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> --extraordinary.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.017 align:middle line:84%
And they're attached to
the juice of the thing

00:38:26.017 --> 00:38:28.032 align:middle line:84%
that they've come
up, for example,

00:38:28.032 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and hard to get past that
to see someone else's juice

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:84%
may be equally as
beneficial to the whole.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you have to get
disinterested in your piece

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and more interested
in surrendering

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to a collective feel that it
wants to create something.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same being in truth.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.290 align:middle line:84%
There's certain dynamics
that need to be put in place.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.103 align:middle line:84%
But then there are collective
in the Evolutionary Collective.

00:38:55.103 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:84%
In the collective
work that we do,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of
leaders, and CEOs,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and people that are doing
major things in the world.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking how
we're functioning,

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and certain exercises, and
certain ways that we're

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
doing things into the
work that they do.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:90%
But we're speaking rarefied.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think unless you put
something new on the menu,

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:90%
people can't order it.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm putting something
new in the menu of, what's

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:90%
possible in relationship?

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.345 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've worked with
people in Hollywood.

00:39:28.345 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:90%
You're in California.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's just horrendous.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.990 align:middle line:84%
You have these brilliant
people that come together.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And the egos and the--

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really on a
low level sometimes.

00:39:40.427 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they could
accomplish anything

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.095 align:middle line:90%
that's of merit is amazing.

00:39:46.095 --> 00:39:46.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's amazing.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a tribute to something.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:90%
But I have a personal desire.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been around creative
people all my life--

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:90%
photographers and artists.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But particularly, people
that do collaborative work,

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is I would love to get my
hands on a group of people that

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.050 align:middle line:84%
were making a movie
or doing something

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:84%
creative with at least
20 people and see

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:84%
if they'd be willing to actually
add this element into it.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I think what they could
create would be off the charts.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you a question.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:84%
What about the
younger generation

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.310 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use this classic
metaphysical term, so some

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of the influx of what
were called Indigos?

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But just children of the
generation of our sons

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and younger, who are coming
in with a different awareness.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've also been raised
differently than we were.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Hopefully.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.737 align:middle line:90%
But are you seeing any?

00:40:40.737 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you're
dealing with many

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:90%
of the younger people.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they haven't really hit
their stride, power wise yet,

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and have the funds to be able
to hire someone to do this,

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.060 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But are you seeing a difference
generationally at all?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> They're different in
that they have a collective

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:57.155 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really--

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I've noticed.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --so cool.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That is so cool.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.685 align:middle line:84%
So I've found--
and we have had--

00:41:03.685 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:84%
in the work that
I've done, we've

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.860 align:middle line:90%
had everything from 28 to 84--

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so--

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> --which is really--

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --they're just
hitting that range.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And so this collective
consciousness,

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:84%
which is theoretically
what the entire planet

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:90%
is really moving toward--

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I see this with
Stuart and his friends.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely
beautiful to behold,

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:84%
this sense of wanting
each other to thrive,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.410 align:middle line:84%
instead of competing
with each other.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there is something.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.960 align:middle line:90%
This is new.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with this
level of consciousness,

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and the groups, and the
collectives for the last four

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it is a new
consciousness that's

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.790 align:middle line:84%
exploding all over the
planet in different ways.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So through the internet,
something is happening through

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.420 align:middle line:90%
collaborative-- the Zipcar.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.855 align:middle line:90%
People are sharing things again.

00:41:51.855 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very cool.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.218 align:middle line:84%
>> There's different kinds of
cities that they're building.

00:41:55.218 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:90%
And there's all kinds of--

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.920 align:middle line:84%
like Eric Whitacre,
the one with the choir.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's through that--

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> --virtual thing.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, beautiful.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's all kind
of collective emergences

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:90%
occurring.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we're doing the deep,
inner subjective elements

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.530 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.760 align:middle line:84%
How do we break the
membrane of separation?

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And what are the ways of
being so that we can still

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.600 align:middle line:84%
have our sense of
individuality, our autonomy,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:84%
but that we're actually
creating relationships

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and collective happenings from a
deep place that's not separate?

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:28.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's my--

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy with that.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was line
of my questioning.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.602 align:middle line:84%
That last question was that as
these younger people come in

00:42:36.602 --> 00:42:38.060 align:middle line:84%
with this collective
consciousness,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is it easier for them to
break through those walls

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of separation and the
ego to do collaborations?

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little
easier than it has

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.880 align:middle line:84%
been up to this point,
because of the new conscious

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:90%
supporting it.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We haven't gotten there yet
as far as having just a group

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:84%
of a certain age, going into
some kind of creative venture.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I would love that.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're still in the emergent
phases of teaching this.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:90%
But I bet it would be different.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it would.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it doesn't really
matter, it seems here,

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.030 align:middle line:84%
whether we're looking at
a personal relationship,

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:84%
or business relationship,
or social friendships,

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that one thing you talk about is
that there has to be something

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.820 align:middle line:90%
of a higher purpose.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And just give us an idea of
the variety of areas of life

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and our psyche that that
could be referring to.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, there's two elements
of the higher purpose.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.040 align:middle line:84%
One is-- and many people
are interested in this.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think they don't
always look at relationship

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:46.160 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle for egolessness,
so transcendence, becoming

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.200 align:middle line:90%
completely who you are.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Relationship is a
phenomenal vehicle

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.660 align:middle line:90%
if you use it correctly.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.410 align:middle line:84%
If you do what
I'm talking about,

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.960 align:middle line:84%
you will continue to take
apart those identities,

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and those fears, and
those everythings

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that keep you not only
separate from another,

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.840 align:middle line:84%
but really separate
from yourself.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, really.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you're willing to
take that on as a path,

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:84%
as a way in which to
really unfold oneself.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're lucky to have one, or
two, or many other people that

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.715 align:middle line:90%
are equally committed.

00:44:22.715 --> 00:44:25.250 align:middle line:84%
The Evolutionary Collective,
the work that I do in groups

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is that's what everyone
is committed to.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we create
this "I" cloud

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of relatedness in the
collective field that is also

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:84%
putting pressure on the ego
itself so that those things are

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:84%
dissolving, even when we're not
together, which is interesting.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good point.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're talking about
beyond your own intention

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and creating this
collective of consciousness

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that can work either,
obviously, for or against us.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But this is that quantum
field of relationship

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:90%
that you speak of.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So you have--

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:58.300 align:middle line:84%
there could be you and I
having that together as friends

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
when we say, OK, let's
see what's possible here.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned
some ways to do it.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's see where
we can go, what

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
this particular relationship
is for, so instead

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:90%
of what I think it's for.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what it
wants to be, instead

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of my ideas or your ideas of
what I need from you, right?

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So on that, you're
the interviewee.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm the interviewer.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And you would take that, for
example, and begin exploring,

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:90%
take those titles away.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And you would begin
exploring with me what

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.560 align:middle line:84%
it is that might be there
for our higher participation,

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.060 align:middle line:84%
learning, unfolding
on other levels.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Creativity.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Creativity, all of it.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so relationships
are to show up like that.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.460 align:middle line:90%
So the second part is--

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:48.200 align:middle line:84%
so it's a possibility
of dissolving your ego

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what's possible
in the relationships

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're in, where they
can go, what can happen.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Here's the other piece
that I'm really--

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.730 align:middle line:84%
what drives me the
most at this point,

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:84%
having experienced what I
experienced with Peter one

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:04.710 align:middle line:90%
on one.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.666 align:middle line:90%
And 1 plus 1 equaled--

00:46:07.666 --> 00:46:09.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thousands.

00:46:09.388 --> 00:46:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we felt
like millionaires.

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:84%
We weren't millionaires, but
we felt like millionaires,

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.440 align:middle line:84%
like we had this rich
abundance of the universe

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.530 align:middle line:90%
at our disposal.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.960 align:middle line:84%
What I feel-- and
Teilhard de Chardin

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.450 align:middle line:84%
said this and
[INAUDIBLE] said this.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:90%
I found out later.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I was busy going,
wow, if between us, we

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:39.060 align:middle line:84%
were shown this crazy, huge
world of unfoldment, what

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:44.360 align:middle line:84%
if you just got 20 people,
40 people who were relating

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:84%
correctly, who were
learning and dissolving,

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and then we were all in
some web of relationship?

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Then what could they do?

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like, then, what could
descend and arise through us?

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:90%
For me, that's worth my life.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I want that.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.610 align:middle line:84%
We are developing
that at this point.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel that's
what the universe wants.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.850 align:middle line:10%
It wants to know that if we can
have collectives of people that

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:10%
are really courageous, and
really willing, and really

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.840 align:middle line:10%
ready, have the right
readiness for certain openings,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.670 align:middle line:10%
then what could happen
could be off the charts.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Off the charts.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Talk about leaving Earth to me.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.450 align:middle line:90%
That's my outer space odyssey.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's beautiful.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.737 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think we
need to find out.

00:47:35.737 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be everybody.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.727 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we get clumps
of people all over that

00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:41.810 align:middle line:90%
are really ready for this.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:43.645 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us
post-modern people

00:47:43.645 --> 00:47:45.770 align:middle line:84%
who have done a lot of work
and done this and that,

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.200 align:middle line:90%
it's like, OK, time to move on.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Time to stop making
it about you and let's

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.780 align:middle line:84%
find out what's
possible together.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think we will
forge open some openings

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it will be easier
for those kinds of things

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to descend.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And then people can actually
start relating differently.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very exciting.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.428 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as you're
speaking, I'm thinking

00:48:10.428 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of a few of our
viewers that write

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.650 align:middle line:84%
to us on a regular basis, who
we have a bit of a feel for now.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, they're going
to be so excited to hear

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.152 align:middle line:90%
you talking about that.

00:48:19.152 --> 00:48:20.360 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that now.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who is resonating
with what you're saying,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.710 align:middle line:84%
how do they have a
chance to connect

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.710 align:middle line:90%
with you or this larger effort?

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.075 align:middle line:90%
And what happens from here?

00:48:29.075 --> 00:48:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>> A couple different ways.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So one is if they
want to first just get

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.330 align:middle line:84%
a sense of what this
evolutionary relationshipness

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is, obviously, we can only
cover a "piece" of it here.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I am doing a virtual course
that starts August 24.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And people will be able to do it
online from all over the world

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and at least begin the process
and begin to be immersed in,

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:57.050 align:middle line:84%
like I said, a different way
of orienting oneself and seeing

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the possibility
of relationships.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
that Jeff Carreira,

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.750 align:middle line:84%
who I mentioned to you before,
who's the director of education

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.620 align:middle line:84%
for Enlighten Next
with Andrew Cohen,

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and who is an amazing man.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like meeting
Peter, only as a teacher.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.528 align:middle line:84%
We have this incredible
connection as two teachers.

00:49:17.528 --> 00:49:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me his name once again.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll write it down this time.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Jeff Carreira.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Carreira.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:21.550 align:middle line:90%
C-A?

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.625 align:middle line:90%
>> R-R-E-I-R-A.

00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:24.425 align:middle line:90%
>> I-R-A?

00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:25.225 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:25.225 --> 00:49:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so we are perfectly
matched master teachers,

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:34.050 align:middle line:84%
really, and have this endless
commitment to working with

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:34.850 align:middle line:90%
the field.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're the
perfect demonstration

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.860 align:middle line:90%
of what we're teaching.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're teaching an
Evolutionary Collective course.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.410 align:middle line:90%
We'll be beginning a new one--

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.270 align:middle line:90%
2012 in New York.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And now, that's not virtual?

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's live.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.355 align:middle line:90%
>> That's live.

00:49:50.355 --> 00:49:51.155 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there's lots of
virtual stuff in between that

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.790 align:middle line:90%
people will be involved in.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But it will be-- there's a
weekend where people can then

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.660 align:middle line:90%
take it a little farther.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.263 align:middle line:84%
And then if they're
ready to go, they say,

00:50:03.263 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, I really want
to do this, then

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.250 align:middle line:84%
there's a year where
they meet three times

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.980 align:middle line:84%
for three and a half days
each with virtual connection

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:90%
in between.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And we're experimenting with--

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:84%
the in-person part, I
think, is essential.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:90%
There's no way around that.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Ooh, I think I have
someone in mind for you--

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No way around that.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> --from New York.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the virtual part--
we'll have some virtual one

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.420 align:middle line:84%
days, where people
can collect together.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And then everyone is connected,
is there is an "I" cloud.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.850 align:middle line:84%
There's like the--
what did we call it?

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We called it the awakened
culture cloud of that group.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, you feel
connected all the time.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The way we build it, you
feel this looping between you

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and it, and it and you.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's the coolest part.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
start to feel that,

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.347 align:middle line:84%
something changes in
your life forever.

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's that quantum
field of relationship--

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --that you refer to often.

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And we build that together
in the Evolutionary Collective.

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are leaders,
and change agents,

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.880 align:middle line:90%
and awesome people.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's attracting the edge
people, the 1% of the people

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.620 align:middle line:90%
that love doing stuff.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's the opportunity
at the moment.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:19.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll tell people how to get a
hold of you at the end of this.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Any other final thoughts?

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:22.100 align:middle line:90%
This has been wonderful.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's one other thing.

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:25.710 align:middle line:90%
We do a radio show.

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a free opportunity
to stay in the conversation

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.540 align:middle line:84%
until people are
sufficiently inspired.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very good.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> But final thoughts?

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:40.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's love.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really is
about what's possible,

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:48.910 align:middle line:84%
bringing heaven
on Earth, bringing

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:52.180 align:middle line:84%
what we can bring at this
point as human beings together.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And there is a joy.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.580 align:middle line:90%
There's incredible joy in that.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel it
fits into your work--

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> --because you're
always on the edge.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what I'm saying?

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That is so true.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Ooh, am I going to get
in trouble if I do this?

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Always.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Which I deeply respect.

00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.230 align:middle line:90%
And I deeply enjoy.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you couldn't do
it any other way, right?

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the edge
in a certain domain.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.225 align:middle line:90%
And so-- yeah.

00:52:22.225 --> 00:52:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you so much
for your time, Patricia.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.532 align:middle line:90%
>> I've loved talking with you.

00:52:26.532 --> 00:52:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, as Patricia mentioned,
she has weekend and ongoing

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:84%
workshops for people to gather
and challenge themselves

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to find the courage to tell
their own deepest truths.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:42.600 align:middle line:84%
You can reach her
through her website

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.740 align:middle line:90%
at evolutionarycollective.com.

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks
for watching "CMN."
