00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.784
<v ->Many of you have probably heard of Feng Shui,</v>

2
00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:05.246
but how many of you know that this practice of creating

3
00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.946
spacial harmony has a more ancient counterpart?

4
00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:11.658
It's called Vastu, a 5,000 year old tradition that has

5
00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:15.262
it's roots in the science of magnetism and geometry.

6
00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:17.556
Everything from the direction your head faces

7
00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:20.617
when you sleep, to clutter, is taken into consideration

8
00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:23.864
when arranging your home or office according to Vastu.

9
00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:28.838
(instrumental music)

10
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.461
<v Host>Since you've last spoken with us</v>

11
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:38.327
you have a new book out, The Way of Vastu.

12
00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:41.762
Just an incredible book, so graceful and informative,

13
00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:42.966
just like the last one.

14
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.580
And this one really focuses on prosperity,

15
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.428
which I think is on probably most people's minds

16
00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.924
no matter what their portfolio looks like.

17
00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:55.393
So talk about some of the principles behind,

18
00:00:55.393 --> 00:00:57.611
and I know a little later on we're going to see what

19
00:00:57.611 --> 00:00:59.158
it looks like in your office.

20
00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.143
Talk about some of the principles about Vastu,

21
00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:05.707
and space, and the movement of energy, and prosperity.

22
00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:13.404
<v ->The premise of Vastu is that the environment is alive,</v>

23
00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:16.480
which is something that our Western mindset really

24
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.108
doesn't believe in, or pay attention to.

25
00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.100
Most Western architects design more for aesthetics

26
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:33.296
than they do for how energy affects our physiology,

27
00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:35.857
or our consciousness for that matter.

28
00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:39.513
Vastu takes into consideration that the environment

29
00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:41.807
is alive, and can support us.

30
00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:44.612
The focus of the book is on prosperity because it's

31
00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:46.724
an issue for most people.

32
00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:50.927
When we design according to Vastu, the rectangular or

33
00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:54.479
square shape is really the most life-enhancing shape.

34
00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.779
So having that as your design really

35
00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:03.772
supports your life in a beneficial way.

36
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.002
When an environment is not that way,

37
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:12.423
not shaped in that way, there can be problems.

38
00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.843
Energy can move too fast.

39
00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:20.892
One example that we use is the Parliament building

40
00:02:20.892 --> 00:02:22.876
in Delhi.

41
00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.993
It's shaped as a, I believe it's a circle, could be

42
00:02:26.993 --> 00:02:28.923
not a circle though.

43
00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:30.384
I'm trying to think.

44
00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:35.328
It may be a octagon, but the fact is--

45
00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:36.348
<v Host>Like a bagua.</v>

46
00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:37.095
<v ->Yes.</v>

47
00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:40.124
The fact is that energy moves very quickly in

48
00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:41.724
an environment like that.

49
00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:45.362
It's really good for sporting events, because things

50
00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:47.985
happen very quickly in a sporting event.

51
00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:52.250
But when you have decisions

52
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.446
that affect an entire nation,

53
00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:57.658
you want people to think clearly, and to take their time

54
00:02:57.658 --> 00:02:59.652
to make wise decisions.

55
00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:03.993
The problem with that building specifically, is that

56
00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:08.086
because energy is moving so fast, you have a lot of chaos.

57
00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:11.052
<v Host>Well, let's get into a bit of a philosophical</v>

58
00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:12.075
chat about that.

59
00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:13.409
<v ->Sure.</v>

60
00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.256
<v Host>From some of what I've known and understanded,</v>

61
00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:19.605
say if you go to Rudolf Steiner's work and the work

62
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:23.104
of some others, that the notion of having more rounded,

63
00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:26.741
and less linear, less right angles in a space, fosters

64
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.461
growth and creativity etcetera.

65
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:33.851
How does that pull into what you're saying?

66
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.369
Do we need to divide spaces so we have our

67
00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:38.288
flowing creative spaces?

68
00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:40.721
And then maybe in the office or certain spaces

69
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.385
have it more linear?

70
00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:43.889
Can you talk about that a bit?

71
00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.688
<v ->Well, from my perception, we're talking about</v>

72
00:03:49.748 --> 00:03:53.466
living spaces that are stable environments

73
00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.345
where our energy can grow and support us,

74
00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.624
as opposed to maybe

75
00:03:57.624 --> 00:04:00.813
an educational environment where learning occurs

76
00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:03.437
and there's an interchange, an intellectual interchange,

77
00:04:03.437 --> 00:04:07.394
and maybe in those situations creativity seems to grow

78
00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:10.808
quicker in those kind of environments.

79
00:04:10.808 --> 00:04:15.789
But from a science point of view, this is what

80
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.556
Vastu is based on.

81
00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.993
It is based on a structure being

82
00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.998
the most life-enhancing,

83
00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:25.466
and it's either square or rectangular.

84
00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:28.570
I think Mike is probably the better person to talk to

85
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.642
about the real reasons this is so.

86
00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:34.712
Mine is basically learned secondhand.

87
00:04:34.712 --> 00:04:37.102
As an architect he can apply this

88
00:04:37.102 --> 00:04:39.682
and really talk more in-depth about this.

89
00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:42.893
<v Host>But this is also your combined experience</v>

90
00:04:42.893 --> 00:04:46.552
and observation, and can you give us some ideas

91
00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:49.783
along the lines of prosperity and space that maybe

92
00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:52.568
was too quick flowing that you worked with,

93
00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:53.823
with a client for example,

94
00:04:53.823 --> 00:04:55.146
that has helped turn them around?

95
00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.809
Everybody loves success stories.

96
00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:57.769
<v ->Right.</v>

97
00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:02.260
Well, let me give you an example of one of our clients

98
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.253
who had a missing north area of their home.

99
00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.682
They had a cut in the north.

100
00:05:09.682 --> 00:05:11.773
<v Host>What does that mean, a cut in the north?</v>

101
00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:17.705
<v ->The house, instead of having a full</v>

102
00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:20.749
side of the house there, it was cut in.

103
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:25.442
So it was like a very architecturally beautiful house,

104
00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:29.346
but they had a lot of different planes, and areas

105
00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:33.879
that moved, where energy got stuck or was eliminated.

106
00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.730
When you don't have a north side of an environment,

107
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.660
that's your abundance.

108
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.095
And so they had this gorgeous house that they moved into,

109
00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:45.814
that was a multi-million dollar home, but they were

110
00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:49.430
having a lot of problems maintaining their financial

111
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.883
equilibrium once they moved into this house.

112
00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:54.939
And so what we were able to do,

113
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.413
with the quality of Vastu that we offer

114
00:05:57.413 --> 00:05:59.387
people in pre-existing structures,

115
00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:03.694
is recreate a perfect Vastu for them so that

116
00:06:03.694 --> 00:06:07.246
the energy could build in that area.

117
00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:10.135
When the energy is missing in the north, it's the stable,

118
00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:14.081
life-enhancing, magnetic energy that comes from the north,

119
00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:17.846
if that isn't available, there's nothing to build on.

120
00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:22.112
And so there's nothing that is attracting abundance for you.

121
00:06:22.112 --> 00:06:26.987
And so we've developed technology based on the ancient

122
00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:31.191
system of Vastu that allows us to

123
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.943
redesign environments, energetically,

124
00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:35.310
that are already existing.

125
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.211
So people don't have to demolish an environment

126
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.536
or remodel a home.

127
00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.821
<v Host>And that includes energetically compensating</v>

128
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:45.634
for missing spaces--

129
00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:49.974
<v ->Missing areas, or areas let's say that are,</v>

130
00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:52.034
the opposite can happen.

131
00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:53.941
If your southeast

132
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:56.724
is overextended,

133
00:06:56.724 --> 00:07:01.416
let's say you have more property, or more house on

134
00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:04.777
the southeast and it's growing, it's a larger

135
00:07:04.777 --> 00:07:06.505
piece on that side.

136
00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:09.513
It can create too much heat, and you can have

137
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:13.897
a lot of problems with things burning up.

138
00:07:13.897 --> 00:07:16.723
So it's creating balance.

139
00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:20.702
Vastu is about creating harmony in an environment,

140
00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:25.235
and that balance, once that balance is created,

141
00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:30.219
then it is as if you got a chiropractic adjustment

142
00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:31.831
for your house.

143
00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:35.532
Then the house goes, "Oh great, now I feel good."

144
00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:38.827
And you can put your attention on building,

145
00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:41.004
instead of trying to compensate.

146
00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:45.856
So if like the body is in pain, what happens?

147
00:07:45.856 --> 00:07:47.947
It's very difficult to concentrate on the things

148
00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:49.312
that you do want.

149
00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:52.523
You're compensating for what is uncomfortable,

150
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:56.139
and you're trying to adjust to feel less pain.

151
00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.943
Whereas, if your body was without pain,

152
00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:02.656
or without congestion, you then have a feeling

153
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:05.973
of balance and you can put your attention

154
00:08:05.973 --> 00:08:07.838
on something else.

155
00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:11.007
<v Host>And most people, even if they have not been</v>

156
00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:13.631
conditioned to think about their homes as this

157
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:17.000
living and breathing entity, can certainly sense and feel

158
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.092
it when they go into a space.

159
00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:21.673
Give us some common examples of how people

160
00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:23.710
who wouldn't consider themselves to be particularly

161
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.304
sensitive, are in fact reacting to spaces around

162
00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:28.297
them all the time.

163
00:08:28.297 --> 00:08:29.929
What's classic in this?

164
00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:32.369
<v ->Well, you can see it in the technology industry.</v>

165
00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:36.262
A lot of people work in cubicles, and they're sitting

166
00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:40.230
in front of a computer for 10, 12, 14 hours a day

167
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.769
trying to get work done.

168
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:45.222
And a lot of that work, even though maybe most of us

169
00:08:45.222 --> 00:08:48.049
don't think in the same way, that's very creative

170
00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:50.938
work in a very linear way.

171
00:08:50.938 --> 00:08:54.266
I mean, you're creating something

172
00:08:56.016 --> 00:08:57.655
in technology.

173
00:08:57.655 --> 00:09:00.514
And they're expected to work under pressure

174
00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:01.527
at the same time.

175
00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:04.331
They're working within a group, and they have an assignment

176
00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:07.052
that needs to be done, so they're working under deadline.

177
00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:09.963
And they burn out very easily,

178
00:09:09.963 --> 00:09:12.748
and they have a lot of illness and--

179
00:09:12.748 --> 00:09:14.791
<v Host>And now that we're in Seattle, so of course</v>

180
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:17.393
probably the technology capital now.

181
00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:20.955
<v ->Yes, and you have people who are struggling</v>

182
00:09:20.955 --> 00:09:24.250
in their careers, under a lot of stress,

183
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.588
and they need to stay very focused,

184
00:09:28.588 --> 00:09:31.310
very motivated, to be able to have

185
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.156
the success that they want.

186
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.879
And yet they're struggling

187
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:40.614
with that success because

188
00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:43.111
they're working under adverse conditions.

189
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:47.963
They don't have natural lighting, they don't have windows,

190
00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:51.259
maybe their computers are set up in the wrong way.

191
00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:55.684
There's some things that can be done to enhance

192
00:09:55.694 --> 00:10:00.465
their ability to think clearer, to be more creative,

193
00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:02.805
to be more successful.

194
00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:04.768
But if you don't know these things, you're working

195
00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:07.007
against the stream of

196
00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.020
creativity.
<v Host>Under duress almost.</v>

197
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.439
Energetic duress.

198
00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:11.657
<v ->And you see a lot of that, you see a lot of people</v>

199
00:10:11.657 --> 00:10:14.291
burning out in that industry over time.

200
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:19.397
<v Host>Conversely, we'll maybe walk into someone's house,</v>

201
00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:23.494
it may not be a beautiful home, maybe very, very, very

202
00:10:23.494 --> 00:10:26.565
modest, simple home but it just feels good.

203
00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:27.376
<v ->Right.</v>

204
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:30.608
And people who have had their homes balanced

205
00:10:30.608 --> 00:10:35.204
according to this science, either by us or they read

206
00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:39.184
the book, and they learn about things that they can

207
00:10:39.184 --> 00:10:42.509
do themselves, or they get an analysis

208
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:44.867
from us online.

209
00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.042
We have clients all over the world, we don't actually

210
00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:49.976
have to go to somebody's home to do that.

211
00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:52.634
Once those...

212
00:10:57.236 --> 00:11:00.210
Once those qualities are enhanced, that are enhanced

213
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.230
using Vastu, once there is balance in the environment,

214
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.644
it is like the environment takes a big sigh and you

215
00:11:06.644 --> 00:11:10.482
actually start building the positive energy

216
00:11:10.482 --> 00:11:12.072
in an environment.

217
00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.430
And it's obvious, it is really obvious.

218
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.455
People can feel that.

219
00:11:16.455 --> 00:11:19.751
And you don't have to understand subtle energy

220
00:11:19.751 --> 00:11:22.689
to actually have an experience of that.

221
00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Host>Right.</v>

222
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.387
You just feel, you walk into certain restaurants

223
00:11:25.387 --> 00:11:26.870
and you just feel that.

224
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.661
<v Host>You go into another one,</v>
<v ->You know there is a difference.</v>

225
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:30.015
<v Host>I won't come back here because</v>

226
00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:31.339
it doesn't feel good.

227
00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:34.793
<v ->The restaurants that we've designed using Vastu,</v>

228
00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:37.387
or the healing centers,

229
00:11:37.387 --> 00:11:41.100
or the homes that we've done

230
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.333
using Vastu, it's very significant, the change.

231
00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:48.661
And it's always like food critics that will mention

232
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:50.411
when they go to a restaurant, they'll always mention

233
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.627
the environment.

234
00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:53.962
We enjoyed being there, we didn't want to leave.

235
00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:57.920
And it's not an obvious quality, but it's palpable,

236
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.298
it is something that people feel.

237
00:12:00.298 --> 00:12:02.762
<v Host>And certainly we mentioned this in the last</v>

238
00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:06.804
interview, Bill Gates was one of Michael's clients.

239
00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:10.112
<v ->One of his clients, yes, but not a client</v>

240
00:12:10.112 --> 00:12:13.481
that necessarily understood what was going on,

241
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.231
but actually realized the effects

242
00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:19.773
of the environment being aligned according to Vastu.

243
00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:24.594
<v Host>So, the good news in this is that most people</v>

244
00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:27.623
live in either square or rectangular spaces.

245
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:30.258
So it's not as if we're having to structurally

246
00:12:30.258 --> 00:12:32.317
fight up hill on this one.

247
00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.196
So for most individuals it's a matter of enhancing,

248
00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:37.554
especially if you're going room by room.

249
00:12:37.554 --> 00:12:40.498
Most rooms tend to be the rectangular or square, right?

250
00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:44.870
<v ->We have some clients let's say, whose homes are</v>

251
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.854
U-shaped, or L-shaped, and they have a swimming

252
00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:50.840
pool in the middle, which is...

253
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.646
You see a lot of that in Southern California,

254
00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:56.870
and those people,

255
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.494
the homes are architecturally gorgeous,

256
00:12:59.494 --> 00:13:02.320
but they have this excessive water element,

257
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.263
and sometimes, most times in the wrong area.

258
00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:08.538
And they're drowning in too much water

259
00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.871
in the wrong area.

260
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:12.356
And people go, "Well we're not gonna fill in the swimming

261
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:14.180
"pool, what are we gonna do here?"

262
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.956
We recreate the Vastu boundaries in the environment

263
00:13:17.956 --> 00:13:22.406
so that that swimming pool is eliminated from

264
00:13:22.406 --> 00:13:24.483
the configurations, almost like it becomes

265
00:13:24.483 --> 00:13:25.912
it's own property.

266
00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:28.611
So there's subtle things that we can do that you don't

267
00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:33.186
even see, that actually change the energy and environment.

268
00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:37.147
So, I would say most homes

269
00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:42.133
aren't perfectly Vastu oriented, very, very few are.

270
00:13:42.574 --> 00:13:45.817
Even our home, even though we were looking

271
00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:48.782
for very specific things, it's a remodel.

272
00:13:48.782 --> 00:13:51.321
We used our home as our testing grounds,

273
00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:54.755
because it isn't perfect, and we perfected,

274
00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:57.820
over time, the technology that we now use

275
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.454
on people's homes all over the world.

276
00:14:00.454 --> 00:14:05.030
So you can live in an imperfect Vastu environment

277
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.043
and thrive.

278
00:14:06.043 --> 00:14:09.679
<v Host>And also, part of what I was alluding to earlier,</v>

279
00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:11.717
are the micro-environments within the home.

280
00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:13.648
In this case, we're going to be taking a look

281
00:14:13.648 --> 00:14:15.514
at your workspace, or office.

282
00:14:15.514 --> 00:14:18.746
And those often are more manageable in that the

283
00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:23.033
integrity of the original structure is there, and that it's

284
00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:26.180
usually square, or it's usually rectangular.

285
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.985
So there's not so much that you're having to

286
00:14:28.985 --> 00:14:31.043
compensate for, I would assume.

287
00:14:31.043 --> 00:14:34.191
<v ->Right, you know the most that people may need to do</v>

288
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:39.150
is move the desk, and reorganize what is on the desk

289
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.209
for the proper workflow.

290
00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:43.076
<v Host>Let's talk about, before we go into your office</v>

291
00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:47.086
and get a visual scope of this, what are some of the most

292
00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:52.730
frequent sort of mistakes that people make in setting

293
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.357
up their office space, that is blocking a flow

294
00:14:56.357 --> 00:15:00.091
of abundance?

295
00:15:00.091 --> 00:15:03.609
<v ->They're sitting facing the wrong direction.</v>

296
00:15:03.609 --> 00:15:07.482
You wanna sit facing north or east, and the reason

297
00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:11.077
for this is that positive, magnetic energy coming from

298
00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:14.659
the north, and the ultraviolet light coming from

299
00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:19.044
the east are very enhancing to clarity of mind

300
00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.775
and also to prosperity.

301
00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:26.125
So when you want more success and prosperity

302
00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:28.494
in your life, you wanna set up your desk so that

303
00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:32.142
you can really be supported by that prosperity

304
00:15:32.142 --> 00:15:33.752
that's already there.

305
00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:37.656
A lot of people sit facing south or west,

306
00:15:37.656 --> 00:15:39.903
and you're basically

307
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.594
not allowing that energy to support you.

308
00:15:44.594 --> 00:15:48.966
It's hitting your back, it's not supporting and you're

309
00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:53.244
not absorbing it in the way that can be used.

310
00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.369
<v Host>What about the whole culture of people,</v>

311
00:15:56.369 --> 00:16:00.112
often myself included, when I'm in a really creative mode

312
00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:02.502
or I have a fair amount of writing to do, I'll often

313
00:16:02.502 --> 00:16:05.286
get up and leave the house and go to a cafe.

314
00:16:05.286 --> 00:16:07.707
Now this is pretty common, especially people who

315
00:16:07.707 --> 00:16:10.448
work from home, needing this kind of shift in energy

316
00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:11.952
or environment.

317
00:16:11.952 --> 00:16:14.310
Does the same principle...

318
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.560
Would it be wise for us to apply the same principle,

319
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.770
say if we're going to our local coffee shop to do

320
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.541
our writing or our research?

321
00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:25.944
<v ->Mm-hmm, just sit facing east or north.</v>

322
00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.904
I mean, it's as simple as that.

323
00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:31.243
You're looking to absorb the positive energy

324
00:16:31.243 --> 00:16:34.081
coming from those directions, and that's the most

325
00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:36.619
powerful energy that you need to keep your mind

326
00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:38.251
clear, and to be productive.

327
00:16:38.251 --> 00:16:43.143
They've done all sorts of scientific studies on how

328
00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:47.424
the thalamus in the brain fires, and it fires best

329
00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:50.361
when you're sitting in one of those directions.

330
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:53.266
So it's recharging your battery.

331
00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:55.782
<v Host>So we can do that whether we're at home or not?</v>

332
00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:57.916
And if you're going into a workspace that's already

333
00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:01.084
been created for you, have them switch your desk

334
00:17:01.084 --> 00:17:03.579
around, the direction of your desk, take responsibility

335
00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:04.967
<v Host>for yourself?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

336
00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:07.548
<v Host>But if you can't do that, are there other ways</v>

337
00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:09.329
you can compensate if you don't...

338
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.832
If the structure isn't such,

339
00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.890
or your cubicle or cubby isn't built in such

340
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.345
a way that you can flop your desk around the other

341
00:17:15.345 --> 00:17:18.235
direction to face that north or the east, are there

342
00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:20.816
ways in which you can still compensate for it?

343
00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:24.528
<v ->I think that if you can't move your chair,</v>

344
00:17:24.528 --> 00:17:26.768
I mean maybe you can't move the desk but

345
00:17:26.768 --> 00:17:28.731
at least try to move your chair.

346
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:31.034
You know, it's what we say to people.

347
00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:35.774
The same thing when people say that they're sleeping

348
00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:38.440
with their head to the north instead to the south,

349
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.628
and that's a whole 'nother important thing that

350
00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:44.243
people should know about is the direction

351
00:17:44.243 --> 00:17:46.482
that we sleep with our head.

352
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:47.901
<v Host>Well why don't you talk about that for a moment</v>

353
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.586
before we go into the office space.

354
00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:53.830
<v ->It's best for you to sleep with your head on</v>

355
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.252
the south wall, preferably.

356
00:17:56.252 --> 00:17:59.868
And the reason is that our body is magnetic,

357
00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:03.057
and the positive polarity is in our head.

358
00:18:03.057 --> 00:18:06.833
The positive energy, magnetic energy, comes from the north.

359
00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:09.617
What happens when you put two positive ends

360
00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:11.729
of a magnet together?

361
00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:13.115
They repel.

362
00:18:13.115 --> 00:18:16.037
So if your head is to the north and you're sleeping

363
00:18:16.037 --> 00:18:19.270
that way at night, you're not able to circulate your

364
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.648
energy in your body.

365
00:18:21.648 --> 00:18:26.075
The body has iron in it, we're magnetic.

366
00:18:26.075 --> 00:18:30.128
In India they bury people with their heads to the north.

367
00:18:30.128 --> 00:18:31.076
<v Host>Why?</v>

368
00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:33.882
<v ->Because it helps dehydrate them faster.</v>

369
00:18:33.882 --> 00:18:38.191
You know, it's not life-supporting, it's just the opposite.

370
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:42.938
And there's a lot of people who suffer from not good sleep,

371
00:18:42.938 --> 00:18:46.606
and pain in the body, and illness, long-term illness,

372
00:18:46.606 --> 00:18:49.326
over time, not being able to eliminate the stress

373
00:18:49.326 --> 00:18:51.662
at night and recharge your batteries

374
00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:54.489
will affect your health.

375
00:18:54.489 --> 00:18:56.217
<v Host>So is this iron-clad?</v>

376
00:18:56.217 --> 00:18:59.075
I mean with the vast array of uniqueness among

377
00:18:59.075 --> 00:19:01.816
individuals, is this true for everybody,

378
00:19:01.816 --> 00:19:03.747
or for most everyone?

379
00:19:03.747 --> 00:19:06.435
Are there people who thrive having their head

380
00:19:06.435 --> 00:19:08.056
to the north while they sleep?

381
00:19:08.056 --> 00:19:10.562
<v ->There are some people that insist they're gonna</v>

382
00:19:10.562 --> 00:19:13.063
sleep that way no matter what.

383
00:19:13.063 --> 00:19:15.470
But they're really the minority.

384
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.903
I've only met a few people like that, but then there are

385
00:19:18.903 --> 00:19:21.112
those people that insist they need a lot of stress

386
00:19:21.112 --> 00:19:23.148
in their life to feel alive.

387
00:19:23.148 --> 00:19:26.519
But is that good for them, is it healthy?

388
00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:30.359
You know, it's up to the individual,

389
00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:33.463
but I think more and more people are realizing

390
00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:36.843
the benefits of sleeping with their heads to the south.

391
00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:40.684
It affects the relationship as well.

392
00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:43.904
If you're not getting a good night's sleep, if you're not

393
00:19:43.904 --> 00:19:47.084
comfortable in bed, you know, it affects your attitude

394
00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:48.480
throughout the day.

395
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.117
It affects all kinds of areas of your life.

396
00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:54.944
<v Host>Okay, so if you don't already have your bed</v>

397
00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.706
with the head to the south,

398
00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:00.989
then find a way to switch it, right?

399
00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:01.735
Okay.

400
00:20:01.735 --> 00:20:05.394
<v ->I would say, and if you can't, some people's bedrooms</v>

401
00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:08.764
are not set up that way, they have to have the head

402
00:20:08.764 --> 00:20:11.451
of their bed on the north wall, try sleeping with your

403
00:20:11.451 --> 00:20:14.492
head at the foot of the bed.

404
00:20:14.492 --> 00:20:18.277
I mean some people notice that it works just as well.

405
00:20:18.277 --> 00:20:21.521
<v Host>Hey, it's certainly worth it to do a run,</v>

406
00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:24.347
at least as an experiment if we're not already

407
00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:25.286
oriented that way.

408
00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:27.621
And I can say that it definitely changed the energy,

409
00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:30.159
and the quality of our sleep in doing that.

410
00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:33.690
So now we're going to follow you over in a second,

411
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.994
and take a look at your office and some of the more

412
00:20:35.994 --> 00:20:38.736
subtle influences you can do within a space

413
00:20:38.736 --> 00:20:41.902
to bring about a proper flow of the energy.

414
00:20:41.902 --> 00:20:42.959
<v ->Alright.</v>

415
00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:48.716
So I'd like to show you how I have set up

416
00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:51.298
my desk for success.

417
00:20:51.298 --> 00:20:55.160
I started with my northeast corner,

418
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.218
which is the water element.

419
00:20:57.218 --> 00:21:01.986
It's where new ideas begin growing energy,

420
00:21:01.986 --> 00:21:06.017
and we have the water element here

421
00:21:06.017 --> 00:21:08.513
to help stimulate new ideas.

422
00:21:08.513 --> 00:21:11.393
And then we go on to the southeast.

423
00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:14.465
Southeast is the fire element, it's where ideas

424
00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.702
take inspiration.

425
00:21:15.702 --> 00:21:18.347
It's also a great place to put your phone or any

426
00:21:18.347 --> 00:21:20.107
electrical items.

427
00:21:20.107 --> 00:21:23.403
In the southeast is where the energy builds

428
00:21:23.403 --> 00:21:28.384
and becomes very stable, and this is where information

429
00:21:28.384 --> 00:21:31.979
gathers, and this is where I have my work that I'm

430
00:21:31.979 --> 00:21:32.896
working on.

431
00:21:32.896 --> 00:21:35.946
The pending work that I'm working on this week.

432
00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:39.818
And over here in the northwest is the completed work.

433
00:21:39.818 --> 00:21:43.989
Magazine articles, my books, my press kit, and this is where

434
00:21:43.989 --> 00:21:47.743
the energy builds and goes out into the universe to

435
00:21:47.743 --> 00:21:49.674
support our business.

436
00:21:49.674 --> 00:21:51.647
<v Host>So basically what's happening here is we have</v>

437
00:21:51.647 --> 00:21:54.836
a gigantic wheel of fortune going from where the little

438
00:21:54.836 --> 00:21:57.620
fountain and spinning ball is, and moving around the

439
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.695
desk to where it begins coming into picking up

440
00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:04.268
inspiration to where now it's really down in the trenches.

441
00:22:04.268 --> 00:22:07.032
Earthy, grounded work with the earth element,

442
00:22:07.032 --> 00:22:09.943
and then sweeping around to the place of completion

443
00:22:09.943 --> 00:22:12.556
where your inspirations makes it's way out into the world.

444
00:22:12.556 --> 00:22:13.569
Is that a good...

445
00:22:13.569 --> 00:22:15.179
Is that the summary of it?

446
00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Robin>That's it in a nutshell.</v>

447
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.675
<v Host>That's easy enough, if you have a desk</v>

448
00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:20.093
you can do it.

449
00:22:20.093 --> 00:22:21.214
<v Robin>Definitely.</v>

450
00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:22.835
<v Host>Well that seemed clear enough looking at your</v>

451
00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:25.459
desk space, and it's a lovely desk space.

452
00:22:25.459 --> 00:22:28.520
However, I've seen a lot of, especially women's desks,

453
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.194
that don't look anything like that.

454
00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:32.018
In fact they're filled with little pictures

455
00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:34.941
of their children and their grandchildren, dead flowers

456
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:38.705
from their anniversary, whatever.

457
00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:40.711
Recipes, shopping lists.

458
00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:43.111
What does it do when you end up having your desk

459
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:44.945
filled with clutter?

460
00:22:44.945 --> 00:22:48.379
<v ->Well clutter holds energy and it can bring you...</v>

461
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:50.488
Sorry.

462
00:22:50.488 --> 00:22:52.887
<v Host>Harry's looking for his toy, go ahead.</v>

463
00:22:52.887 --> 00:22:55.426
<v ->Okay, (laughs) clutter can hold energy</v>

464
00:22:55.426 --> 00:22:56.845
and it brings you down.

465
00:22:56.845 --> 00:22:59.607
So it brings the energy down.

466
00:22:59.607 --> 00:23:01.836
So where ever there's clutter, on a desk or

467
00:23:01.836 --> 00:23:04.363
in an environment, it will hold energy

468
00:23:04.363 --> 00:23:06.273
and create congestion.

469
00:23:06.273 --> 00:23:09.941
So if you want your energy to flow freely

470
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:13.280
in your environment, on your desk, or in your home,

471
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.469
or your office, you need to clear the clutter.

472
00:23:16.469 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Host>So can it literally prohibit you from reaching</v>

473
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.688
your goals, from receiving, from all of the above?

474
00:23:22.688 --> 00:23:24.085
<v ->All of the above.</v>

475
00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:27.029
It really makes it difficult to think creatively

476
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:29.140
and to work optimally.

477
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.498
<v Host>Can we expand that out just a little bit</v>

478
00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:33.631
before we sign off here, and talk about what the clutter

479
00:23:33.631 --> 00:23:35.305
means in the rest of your home?

480
00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:37.492
What about in your bedroom or your bathroom?

481
00:23:37.492 --> 00:23:40.681
A lot of ladies aren't very tidy in their bedrooms,

482
00:23:40.681 --> 00:23:42.388
<v Host>and bathrooms.</v>
<v ->Well, just imagine</v>

483
00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:46.153
where ever there's clutter, it's related to the direction

484
00:23:46.153 --> 00:23:50.249
that it's in, it's that energy that it's oppressing.

485
00:23:50.249 --> 00:23:54.803
So if you want abundance and you have clutter in the north,

486
00:23:54.803 --> 00:23:57.917
it's all you really need to do is to do a little

487
00:23:57.917 --> 00:24:00.328
spring cleaning, and eliminate that clutter,

488
00:24:00.328 --> 00:24:01.586
and see what happens.

489
00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:05.714
It's as if you are holding back the opportunities

490
00:24:05.714 --> 00:24:07.132
when you have clutter.

491
00:24:07.132 --> 00:24:11.078
And a lot of people collect things to feel more secure

492
00:24:11.078 --> 00:24:14.182
in themselves, they don't realize how much it's holding

493
00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:15.782
things in place.

494
00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:18.545
Sometimes we want things to maintain a certain

495
00:24:18.545 --> 00:24:22.246
equilibrium and be predictable, we like things as they are,

496
00:24:22.246 --> 00:24:24.667
but then they become stagnant and outdated.

497
00:24:24.667 --> 00:24:26.447
If you want energy to move, and you want new

498
00:24:26.447 --> 00:24:28.784
opportunities to come in, clear the clutter.

499
00:24:28.784 --> 00:24:30.330
<v Host>Where's your love life again?</v>

500
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.304
<v ->It's in the northwest.</v>

501
00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.584
<v Host>In the northwest corner.</v>

502
00:24:33.584 --> 00:24:35.492
So if you have a bedroom, for example, in the northwest

503
00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:37.626
corner and you have it full.

504
00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:38.991
Full, full, full.

505
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:40.997
Trinkets, stuffed animals, you name it.

506
00:24:40.997 --> 00:24:43.333
<v ->And you've got stagnant energy in your love life,</v>

507
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:44.776
clear the clutter.

508
00:24:46.232 --> 00:24:47.661
<v Host>Thank you for that bit of wisdom.</v>

509
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:49.645
I know there will be many men and women that

510
00:24:49.645 --> 00:24:52.024
will be interested in following up on both

511
00:24:52.024 --> 00:24:54.136
the prosperity and the love life.

512
00:24:54.136 --> 00:24:55.061
Thanks so much for your time.

513
00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:56.127
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

514
00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:56.591
<v Host>Beautiful home.</v>

515
00:24:56.591 --> 00:24:57.926
<v ->Thank you.</v>

516
00:24:59.076 --> 00:25:01.576
<v ->If you resonate with Vastu, I recommend that you watch</v>

517
00:25:01.576 --> 00:25:03.891
the previous interview we did with Robin

518
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:05.212
and her husband, Michael.

519
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.261
They give a great amount of background information

520
00:25:07.261 --> 00:25:09.149
on the ancient science itself.

521
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:11.037
Until next time, thanks for watching.

522
00:25:11.037 --> 00:25:16.034
(instrumental music)
