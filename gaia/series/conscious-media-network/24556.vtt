00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:02.931
<v ->If you've been swept away by The Secret,</v>

2
00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:05.125
get ready for the industrial strength version

3
00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.600
of guided imagery.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.328
Belleruth is one of the most gifted leaders in this field

5
00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:12.161
and she's not content with anecdotal accolades.

6
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:14.506
She wants the hard science behind it.

7
00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:16.004
While her work with clinical studies

8
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:17.908
in which her audio tapes have helped patients

9
00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:20.335
to reduce bleeding and recover more quickly

10
00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:21.879
is impressive in itself,

11
00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.280
she has also helped 9/11 survivors cope with grief

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.287
as her CDs were distributed by the Red Cross.

13
00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:30.447
In addition, she is helping war veterans

14
00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.815
leave their horrifying pasts behind.

15
00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:35.253
Meanwhile, the HMOs smell savings

16
00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:37.424
and now use her work to quicken healing

17
00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.164
so that hospital beds can turn more quickly.

18
00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:41.987
Meet Belleruth.

19
00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:45.650 line:15% 
(relaxing music)

20
00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:48.970
What is wrong with visualization?

21
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.371
<v ->Well it's very misleading.</v>

22
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.436
It's very misleading because it implies

23
00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.004
that you have to see things

24
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.778
and only 55% of the population

25
00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:00.820
has a strongly wired visual memory.

26
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.920
So that leaves people thinking, "Well I can't do that,"

27
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.590
when in fact they can because what you're really doing

28
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.397
is multisensory imagery using all of the senses

29
00:01:11.397 --> 00:01:13.092
and probably for healing

30
00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:18.061
the most potent and effective sense to use

31
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:19.826
is the kinesthetic sense,

32
00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.937
which is felt sense in the body

33
00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.872
and emotional sense, emotional,

34
00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:28.473
the feelings and emotions associated with

35
00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:29.213
whatever it is you're imagining.

36
00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:31.175
<v Voiceover>Everybody feels.</v>

37
00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:32.011
<v ->Hopefully.</v>

38
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.276
<v Voiceover>Well, almost everybody feels.</v>

39
00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:33.985
<v ->Right.</v>

40
00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:34.983
<v Voiceover>We're gonna talk about somebody</v>

41
00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:36.756
who lost his ability to feel for awhile

42
00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:37.615
later in the interview,

43
00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:41.087
which is an absolutely fascinating story.

44
00:01:41.087 --> 00:01:42.994
You are a psychologist, how did you begin--

45
00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:43.951
<v ->Clinical social worker.</v>

46
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:45.832
<v Voiceover>Clinical social worker, okay.</v>

47
00:01:45.832 --> 00:01:49.918
How did you begin on this path of guided imagery?

48
00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:51.904
Because it wasn't your initial chosen path.

49
00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:54.098
You kind of back-ended into it, didn't you?

50
00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:57.836
<v ->Well, I mean any good therapist uses imagery</v>

51
00:01:57.836 --> 00:01:59.137
or they're not a good therapist.

52
00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:02.840
So I always wanted to be a therapist.

53
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.406
That was my idea of a great time.

54
00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:08.924
So I always wanted to be a therapist.

55
00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:11.188
And one of your jobs as a therapist

56
00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:13.185
is to get under people's words

57
00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:14.752
to what's really going on

58
00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:17.829
because you can do some pretty fancy footwork

59
00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.859
with your thinking and cognition.

60
00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.994
So getting under words, you get to people's images,

61
00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:26.664
to people's sort of core sensibilities

62
00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:31.111
and that's kind of in the country I inhabit

63
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:32.539
as a guided imagery person.

64
00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.236
<v Voiceover>Anything that stands out?</v>

65
00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:38.311
What sparked your very initial entry into the field?

66
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:42.642
<v ->Well, I think I'm kind of a space cadet by nature.</v>

67
00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:44.883
So I was a trancy kid, you know.

68
00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:47.356
My mother would send me up to get my socks

69
00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:49.991
and I'd just never come back.
(laughter)

70
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:52.963
'Cause I was lost in my own little fantasy world.

71
00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:56.295
So I think I had a lot of that going on,

72
00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:57.271
not too anchored.

73
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.629
<v Voiceover>So this was a natural marriage?</v>

74
00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.767
<v ->It was.
(laughter)

75
00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.241
It was a natural marriage.

76
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.445
<v Voiceover>Well, what's interesting about your career</v>

77
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:06.547
is you've gone from a space cadet

78
00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:08.335
to actually being highly grounded

79
00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.750
and now working with the medical communities

80
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.513
and working with large institutions, even the Red Cross

81
00:03:13.513 --> 00:03:17.042
for post-traumatic stress disorder after 9/11,

82
00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:18.981
and it's been a long journey.

83
00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:21.117
And let's talk about some of the,

84
00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.313
let's get into some of the science

85
00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:24.449
of what you've learned along the way.

86
00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.654
And if you want, you can leap right into the study,

87
00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:30.301
I was listening to your talk earlier,

88
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:33.540
that was done with Henry Bennett.

89
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.736
<v ->Yes, UC Davis.
<v Voiceover>That study,</v>

90
00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:36.593
UC Davis, that was very interesting.

91
00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:38.741
<v ->It is, it's actually an old study,</v>

92
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.876
but it's really gotten so much rolling.

93
00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:45.251
It's because of that study that Blue Shield of California

94
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.109
uses all of our stuff

95
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.349
and Kaiser Permanente does as well.

96
00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.753
That's the groundbreaking study

97
00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:54.388
and that's why I am so in love with research.

98
00:03:54.388 --> 00:03:56.223
If you want people to get this stuff,

99
00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:58.463
especially if you want them to get it free,

100
00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.692
then you've got to have some grounded

101
00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:04.466
evidence based research to show these institutions

102
00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.764
to say not only is this a feel-good thing

103
00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:09.992
that's going to make people feel much better,

104
00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.571
but you're going to save money

105
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:13.672
and you're going to get a lot of loyalty

106
00:04:13.672 --> 00:04:15.863
and patient satisfaction.

107
00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:18.249
<v Voiceover>Kaching, that's the winning combination.</v>

108
00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:22.046
So that study was profound on a number of levels

109
00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:24.553
because you're monitoring people

110
00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:26.516
who are ready to undergo surgery,

111
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.395
but it also shows the distinction between

112
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:32.553
all these different healing modalities,

113
00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:34.828
guided imagery, visualization,

114
00:04:34.828 --> 00:04:37.731
and Hemi-Sync and a lot of different modalities

115
00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:39.403
side by side in their effects.

116
00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:42.607
So let's launch right into the study and what was found

117
00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:43.567
through these models.
<v ->That's right.</v>

118
00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:46.005
It's not just this great big basket

119
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:48.803
of Fruit Loop interventions that are interchangeable.

120
00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:51.381
There are several ways to look at this.

121
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:53.041
This was a gold standard study.

122
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:57.952
It was with 335 patients and it was randomized,

123
00:04:57.952 --> 00:05:01.888
double-blinded, and placebo controlled.

124
00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:03.722
So it's as good as it gets

125
00:05:03.722 --> 00:05:05.797
and those numbers are big enough

126
00:05:05.797 --> 00:05:07.992
to yield robust findings.

127
00:05:07.992 --> 00:05:11.370
So what we found was people were randomly assigned

128
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.808
four different audio interventions.

129
00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:16.908
The first was an instructional tape by Henry Bennett,

130
00:05:16.908 --> 00:05:18.905
the investigator himself,

131
00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:23.212
the second was affirmations by Linda Rogers,

132
00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:26.719
very finely built affirmations,

133
00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.585
the third was a Hemi-Sync tape, which is audio tones

134
00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:33.441
that are delivered alternately into different ears

135
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:35.287
at different frequencies

136
00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:39.850
thus driving the brain into a state of automatic relaxation,

137
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.961
and as a last minute throw in

138
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.922
there was a guided imagery tape that I had produced

139
00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:50.922
that used imagining good outcomes as the way to go.

140
00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:55.035
There was also a control, a pink noise,

141
00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:56.948
whoosh whoosh tape. (laughs)

142
00:05:56.948 --> 00:05:58.384
<v Voiceover>It had nothing in it but "whoosh, whoosh"?</v>

143
00:05:58.384 --> 00:06:00.509
<v ->Yeah, for the same number of minutes,</v>

144
00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.446
which you need to do if you have a gold standard study.

145
00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.627
And there was also a group of people

146
00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:08.891
who were given a tape, but never listened,

147
00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:12.626
and they became a wonderful other kind of control group.

148
00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:15.029
Relaxed or in denial. (laughs)

149
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:16.330
<v Voiceover>Either way they were</v>

150
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.025
an important part of the control.

151
00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:20.556
So what happened in this study?

152
00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:24.108
There were, as a recall, about 350, 60 some people

153
00:06:24.108 --> 00:06:25.676
in the study?
<v ->335.</v>

154
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:26.473
<v Voiceover>Okay, 335.</v>

155
00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:31.245
<v ->Yes, they had very long, bloody, extended surgeries,</v>

156
00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:34.879
complicated surgeries that lasted seven to nine hours.

157
00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:35.808
Those were the days.

158
00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:39.488
This was 1995, six, seven, something like that.

159
00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:40.754
So these were the days when people

160
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:44.051
actually stayed in the hospital for a number of days

161
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:47.429
and they measured things like blood loss,

162
00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:49.461
pre and postoperative anxiety,

163
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:51.725
and length of stay in the hospital.

164
00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:55.207
And much to Henry's dismay,

165
00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:57.065
what he found was the instructional tape

166
00:06:57.065 --> 00:06:58.446
was helpful on all those levels--

167
00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:01.047
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about those four different models</v>

168
00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:02.150
first a little bit.
<v ->Okay.</v>

169
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.378
<v Voiceover>You have kind of a subtitle</v>

170
00:07:03.378 --> 00:07:04.411
for each of the models.

171
00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:05.967
<v ->Yeah, okay.
<v Voiceover>So Henry's model</v>

172
00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.347
where logic rules.
<v ->Logic rules.</v>

173
00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:10.785
The idea is if you explain to people

174
00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:12.848
what they're about to experience,

175
00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:15.716
it'll give them a sense of control

176
00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:17.782
and that in and of itself will make them do better

177
00:07:17.782 --> 00:07:20.998
and I call that the knowledge is power model

178
00:07:20.998 --> 00:07:22.984
and I happen to agree that knowledge is power.

179
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.330
I'm all about knowledge.

180
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.674
But it doesn't help when you're terrified.

181
00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:30.902
It's too cognitive, it's too much up here.

182
00:07:30.902 --> 00:07:35.139
It's not going to hit the part of your brain

183
00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.251
that's terrified, which is the survival structures,

184
00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:40.654
the lower brain, the brain stem, the mid brain.

185
00:07:40.654 --> 00:07:43.812
These are the places where terror pings.

186
00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:48.688
So if you want to hit people and affect their fear levels,

187
00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:50.557
knowledge is only gonna get you so far

188
00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:52.087
and that's what the study showed.

189
00:07:52.087 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Voiceover>What about affirmations?</v>

190
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.235
<v ->Affirmations.
<v Voiceover>Stuart Smalley.</v>

191
00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:57.068
<v ->Stuart Smalley.(laughs)
<v Voiceover>I am good enough.</v>

192
00:07:57.068 --> 00:07:58.600
<v ->I'm good enough.
(laughter)

193
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.935
There's something, I'm good enough,

194
00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:02.861
I'm something else enough, and people like me.

195
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:04.045
I love Stuart Smalley.

196
00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:05.311
<v Voiceover>I do too.</v>
(laughter)

197
00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:07.667
<v ->He's the most dear character.</v>

198
00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.513
Anyway, that wasn't just a spoof.

199
00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:12.253
That was a brilliant piece of theater.

200
00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:14.250
Anyway, I digress.

201
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.654
The affirmations were helpful,

202
00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:18.790
but same as the instructional tape,

203
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.724
not at a statistically significant level except for anxiety

204
00:08:23.724 --> 00:08:26.882
and I think that's also because

205
00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:30.864
it's wrote cognitive reprogramming and you need--

206
00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:32.797
<v Voiceover>Brainwashing, i.e. cognitive brainwashing.</v>

207
00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:33.923
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

208
00:08:33.923 --> 00:08:36.767
And I call that the fake it till you make it model

209
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:39.205
and it's a perfectly legitimate model

210
00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.945
except you need more time than two days.

211
00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:44.848
People got these tapes two days before their surgery.

212
00:08:44.848 --> 00:08:47.181
They listened to it an average of 2.5 times.

213
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:49.515
That was actually the imagery tape.

214
00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:52.789
Most of them they listened to it an average of 1.5 times.

215
00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:53.985
<v Voiceover>Okay so affirmations</v>

216
00:08:53.985 --> 00:08:55.323
are not going to work 1.5 times.

217
00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:56.019
<v ->Probably not.</v>

218
00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:57.527
<v Voiceover>So the next model, Hemi-Sync.</v>

219
00:08:57.527 --> 00:09:00.267
<v ->Hemi-Sync drives the brain,</v>

220
00:09:00.267 --> 00:09:02.299
produces automatic relaxation.

221
00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:04.772
I call that the technology rules model

222
00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:08.301
and it was very effective at producing relaxation.

223
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:11.378
It in fact relaxed people more than anybody

224
00:09:11.378 --> 00:09:13.212
and they also bled the most.

225
00:09:13.212 --> 00:09:15.441
<v Voiceover>And we'll talk about that in just a sec.</v>

226
00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:17.276
Let's just go to the very last one, which is--

227
00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:18.948
<v ->Last one's the guided imagery,</v>

228
00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:20.643
deliberate directed daydreaming.

229
00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.187
I actually don't have a name for that,

230
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.253
probably because it's my intervention.

231
00:09:24.253 --> 00:09:29.253
But it's a kind of reverie state that's highly strategic

232
00:09:29.722 --> 00:09:31.962
and is very focused

233
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:35.503
and uses healing words,

234
00:09:35.503 --> 00:09:38.789
soothing music, certain kind of voice tone,

235
00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:40.600
and these images.

236
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.038
<v Voiceover>And you are the maestro.</v>

237
00:09:43.038 --> 00:09:45.473
I've heard a lot of, through the last 30 years,

238
00:09:45.473 --> 00:09:48.179
I've heard a lot of guided imagery tapes and so forth.

239
00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:52.149
Yours are certainly the most refined and effective

240
00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:54.552
and go right to the heart of the matter

241
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.586
and the heart of you.

242
00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:57.420
I mean, they're absolutely exquisite.

243
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:57.916
<v ->Thank you.</v>

244
00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:59.019
<v Voiceover>And it's your language.</v>

245
00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.621
So that said--

246
00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:01.829
<v ->It's also the music.</v>

247
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:02.990
<v Voiceover>And the music.</v>
<v ->It's awesome.</v>

248
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.987
<v Voiceover>The music that you have there embedded is,</v>

249
00:10:04.987 --> 00:10:06.426
it's just perfect.

250
00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:10.362
<v ->I fired four composers till I found Steve Kohn</v>

251
00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:13.021
and we've been working together for 20 years.

252
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:14.136
<v Voiceover>What a duo.</v>

253
00:10:14.136 --> 00:10:18.141
So now let's go back to the bleeding part.

254
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.405
After this study was completed,

255
00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:21.973
let's look at what the findings were

256
00:10:21.973 --> 00:10:24.051
with these four modalities.

257
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:29.040
<v ->Well all the modalities produced relaxation.</v>

258
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.689
However, for blood loss,

259
00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:33.951
the controls, the average blood loss for the controls

260
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:36.924
was 3500 cc's.

261
00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:39.965
The guided imagery group was 200.

262
00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:42.195
So it was 150 cc's less.

263
00:10:42.195 --> 00:10:45.062
That is wildly significant.

264
00:10:45.062 --> 00:10:46.897
<v Voiceover>Wildly.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

265
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:49.510
The others did not do that.

266
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.042
<v Voiceover>What about Hemi-Sync?</v>

267
00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:53.805
<v ->Hemi-Sync, 500 cc's.</v>

268
00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:58.805
That's, what is that, 150 over the controls.

269
00:10:58.809 --> 00:10:59.311
Yes.

270
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:02.307
<v Voiceover>Now, that's really surprising,</v>

271
00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:04.989
yet you explain it in such a way

272
00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:07.125
that it makes absolutely perfect sense.

273
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:11.351
Now, can you put that kind of relaxation side by side

274
00:11:11.351 --> 00:11:13.998
with the guided imagery, which got the best results

275
00:11:13.998 --> 00:11:15.496
in terms of the bleeding factor?

276
00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:18.166
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think they both produce relaxation,</v>

277
00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:19.896
but the Hemi-Sync had no content.

278
00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:22.369
It was absolutely content-free.

279
00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:25.202
It was just this mechanical way of getting the brain

280
00:11:25.202 --> 00:11:27.245
to get the body to relax

281
00:11:27.245 --> 00:11:29.880
and in the absence of content.

282
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.483
First of all, everything relaxes

283
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.246
including your blood vessels and so they open wider

284
00:11:34.246 --> 00:11:35.918
and you're going to bleed more.

285
00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:38.553
But the other point is, and this was the point actually--

286
00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:40.480
<v Voiceover>That's true, every single of aspect of you</v>

287
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.129
would just automatically relax.

288
00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:47.129
<v ->Yes, absent mediating suggestions in a relaxed state</v>

289
00:11:47.295 --> 00:11:48.770
where you're very receptive,

290
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.465
saying you're not going to bleed.

291
00:11:50.465 --> 00:11:53.333
So which is what the guided imagery did.

292
00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:56.665
You're in this very relaxed state, but in this relaxed state

293
00:11:56.665 --> 00:12:00.844
you're perceiving yourself bleeding less.

294
00:12:00.844 --> 00:12:05.078
The other piece that was what Henry Bennett thought

295
00:12:05.078 --> 00:12:08.283
was that you don't wanna be just relaxed before surgery

296
00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:13.283
or before any anxiety producing or exertional effort.

297
00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:14.529
You want to be like an athlete.

298
00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:16.793
You want to be calm

299
00:12:16.793 --> 00:12:19.986
and energized and prepared

300
00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:21.669
and feeling ready

301
00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:24.467
and there's a certain, it's a different energy

302
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:29.467
of being relaxed but energized and good to go

303
00:12:29.497 --> 00:12:32.538
and that's how people get with this guided imagery.

304
00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.000
They go from terror to (claps) let's go.

305
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.045
<v Voiceover>Well the way you did it,</v>

306
00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:37.949
I can see why it had such success

307
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:40.085
even if it was only listened to 2.5 times.

308
00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:44.122
You let the audience hear a little sample of it,

309
00:12:44.122 --> 00:12:46.651
the part specifically that referred to the bleeding,

310
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:51.651
done very subtly, very lovingly, very supportively.

311
00:12:51.663 --> 00:12:54.995
So you're zinging that in when a person has already

312
00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:58.394
been put in a very protected, loving place.

313
00:12:58.394 --> 00:12:58.762
<v ->Right.</v>

314
00:12:58.762 --> 00:12:59.825
<v Voiceover>And a realistic place.</v>

315
00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:00.788
Talk about that part.

316
00:13:00.788 --> 00:13:01.705
<v ->Well, yeah.</v>

317
00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:05.374
Basically, sometimes you get some of these guided imagery

318
00:13:05.374 --> 00:13:07.905
meditations that are basically saying, you know,

319
00:13:07.905 --> 00:13:10.610
and your surgeon loves you,

320
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.619
loves you, which is--
(laughter)

321
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:14.012
<v Voiceover>The mind's not gonna buy that one.</v>

322
00:13:14.012 --> 00:13:17.042
<v ->No, it's like, and you don't want a surgeon who loves you.</v>

323
00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:21.686
You want a surgeon who wants to do a very good job

324
00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:23.985
and is not so emotionally attached to you

325
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:25.889
that they're gonna get nervous.

326
00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.015
<v Voiceover>Right, to cut you.</v>

327
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.757
<v ->Yes, to cut you.</v>

328
00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:33.656
So I think that's basically, that's the difference.

329
00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:38.656
And it does produce this real state of readiness.

330
00:13:39.577 --> 00:13:41.644
<v Voiceover>Relaxed readiness.</v>

331
00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:43.745
More appropriate than just having your blood vessels

332
00:13:43.745 --> 00:13:44.906
and everything else relaxing.

333
00:13:44.906 --> 00:13:45.649
<v ->That's right.</v>

334
00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:47.182
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about some of the other effects</v>

335
00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:51.617
that happened in terms of where the control group comes in

336
00:13:51.617 --> 00:13:53.181
in a little bit, some of the other outcomes of that study.

337
00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:54.319
<v ->Oh yes, okay.</v>

338
00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:56.490
Well the whoosh, whoosh people didn't do so well.

339
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.080
I mean, those were the 350.

340
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.529
That was sort of like the baseline median thing.

341
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:06.068
But the group who got a tape and didn't use it,

342
00:14:06.068 --> 00:14:09.330
and we assume that's because either

343
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.036
they just use denial very effectively

344
00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:14.079
in their life as a defense

345
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:17.341
and it's like, "I'm not gonna think about it, it'll be fine"

346
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:19.872
and for some people, you should not mess with it.

347
00:14:19.872 --> 00:14:21.312
That works.
(laughter)

348
00:14:21.312 --> 00:14:24.284
They did as well as the guided imagery people.

349
00:14:24.284 --> 00:14:27.152
But it also could be that there was a group of people

350
00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:31.331
who just had a sort of sense of deep optimism

351
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:35.650
or maybe they were religious and were using prayer,

352
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.806
but basically they said, "I'm cool."

353
00:14:38.806 --> 00:14:41.501
They did great, so I'm not saying--

354
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:42.233
<v Voiceover>That's interesting.</v>

355
00:14:42.233 --> 00:14:43.243
<v ->It is.
(laughter)

356
00:14:43.243 --> 00:14:45.774
And I'm certainly not saying that guided imagery

357
00:14:45.774 --> 00:14:48.177
is something everybody needs or should do

358
00:14:48.177 --> 00:14:49.616
'cause if you're using denial

359
00:14:49.616 --> 00:14:50.905
and you're not thinking about it,

360
00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:52.983
you don't wanna listen to something

361
00:14:52.983 --> 00:14:54.977
that reminds you what's gonna happen next week.

362
00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.357
<v Voiceover>If denial works for you, absolutely.</v>

363
00:14:57.357 --> 00:14:59.052
Sometimes I'm big on that actually.

364
00:14:59.052 --> 00:15:01.177
<v ->Me too.
(laughter)

365
00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:03.789
<v Voiceover>Now, you mentioned Blue Shield</v>

366
00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:05.565
a little while ago and let's talk about

367
00:15:05.565 --> 00:15:09.826
some of the other HMOs that have gotten on board with this

368
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.405
and what they're finding

369
00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:13.297
and also the whole subject of men.

370
00:15:13.297 --> 00:15:15.933
I mean, this seems to be, like the audience today,

371
00:15:15.933 --> 00:15:19.474
it's heavily dominated by female presence.

372
00:15:19.474 --> 00:15:21.831
But let's talk about men, they go in surgery too.

373
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:24.211
<v ->Yes, and when they get a CD,</v>

374
00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:25.952
now it's a CD or a download,

375
00:15:25.952 --> 00:15:29.772
from Blue Shield say or Kaiser of northern California,

376
00:15:29.772 --> 00:15:31.920
which also does this now,

377
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.425
they basically get told by some trusted caregiver,

378
00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:38.015
"Here, you might want to try listening to this.

379
00:15:38.015 --> 00:15:40.825
"We think it could help you with your experience."

380
00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:43.321
And it's 50/50 men and women,

381
00:15:43.321 --> 00:15:45.271
anybody facing surgery.

382
00:15:45.271 --> 00:15:48.603
So as I said earlier this morning,

383
00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:50.438
there are no atheists in foxholes.

384
00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:53.607
There are no men who don't like guided imagery

385
00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:56.150
right before a nasty surgery.

386
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.609
So it's exciting to see.

387
00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:00.651
The other thing I didn't mention, that I should say,

388
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:02.219
when Blue Shield tested,

389
00:16:02.219 --> 00:16:04.959
went back and did retrospective testing

390
00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:06.592
of people who had hysterectomies,

391
00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:11.062
it was about 300 people for this one year,

392
00:16:11.062 --> 00:16:13.056
the women who had,

393
00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:16.829
and this was good data because it was roughly same age,

394
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:20.997
basically healthy people for the most part, and all women,

395
00:16:20.997 --> 00:16:25.502
so there was a little nice little control population there.

396
00:16:25.502 --> 00:16:29.275
The people who had surgery who listened to guided imagery

397
00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:34.175
cost the HMO an average of, are you ready?

398
00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:39.175
$2,003 and seven cents per procedure.

399
00:16:39.225 --> 00:16:41.292
So it's like duh.

400
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:44.717
You get a bulk order

401
00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:46.992
of these CDs that are gonna cost you,

402
00:16:46.992 --> 00:16:49.500
what, seven dollars a piece,

403
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.067
and you save 2,003.

404
00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:52.658
It's like, do the math.

405
00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:53.563
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

406
00:16:53.563 --> 00:16:55.595
<v ->And that's why Kaiser's doing them now.</v>

407
00:16:55.595 --> 00:16:56.837
<v Voiceover>Kaiser's been pretty progressive</v>

408
00:16:56.837 --> 00:16:57.975
about jumping on.
<v ->They've been great.</v>

409
00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.508
<v Voiceover>They want to do what's going to work</v>

410
00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:04.070
because they're looking to save on their overhead

411
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.837
just like everybody else.

412
00:17:04.837 --> 00:17:06.842
<v ->It's a fixed cost.</v>

413
00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:08.445
But I also have to say this.

414
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.884
The people that I've worked with,

415
00:17:09.884 --> 00:17:12.415
at both Blue Shield and at Kaiser,

416
00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:15.085
they also care about the patients' experience

417
00:17:15.085 --> 00:17:17.593
and they want people to feel empowered

418
00:17:17.593 --> 00:17:20.623
and be introduced to these techniques

419
00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:21.866
'cause it's good for them.

420
00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:23.236
<v Voiceover>So this is great that you've been able</v>

421
00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:25.105
to break into the medical industry, which is--

422
00:17:25.105 --> 00:17:26.336
<v ->The research.</v>

423
00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:28.704
<v Voiceover>Right, because of the research.</v>

424
00:17:28.704 --> 00:17:31.908
Let's talk about something that is also a medical,

425
00:17:31.908 --> 00:17:34.834
it is related medically, but it also is a source

426
00:17:34.834 --> 00:17:36.982
of great personal pain for a lot of people,

427
00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:38.781
and that's the whole subject of weight loss.

428
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:43.781
People spend gajillions of dollars on weight loss

429
00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:47.442
guided imagery and visualization tapes

430
00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.590
and books and everything else.

431
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.018
What is the missing element?

432
00:17:51.018 --> 00:17:52.597
Because most of the people

433
00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:54.525
don't lose the weight and keep it off.

434
00:17:54.525 --> 00:17:57.799
What's wrong with the way this culture

435
00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:00.306
is going about trying to lose weight?

436
00:18:00.306 --> 00:18:03.174
<v ->Well, don't get me off on the culture</v>

437
00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:06.645
because, I mean, we're nuts about weight in this culture.

438
00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:07.237
<v Voiceover>Yeah, we are nuts,</v>

439
00:18:07.237 --> 00:18:08.712
but go ahead and launch on the culture.

440
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:09.676
I mean, let's talk about it.

441
00:18:09.676 --> 00:18:10.941
<v ->It's totally skitzy.</v>

442
00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:13.553
I mean, people are obsessed with weight,

443
00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:15.446
as a result they're focused on weight,

444
00:18:15.446 --> 00:18:18.122
and possibly as a result they can't stop

445
00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:20.107
doing everything wrong for themselves.

446
00:18:20.107 --> 00:18:23.764
But I remember after I worked on this imagery

447
00:18:23.764 --> 00:18:25.749
I was, I used to be a very skinny kid,

448
00:18:25.749 --> 00:18:29.232
so weight really wasn't in my field of vision.

449
00:18:29.232 --> 00:18:31.229
I didn't think about it much.

450
00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:33.540
But after I got done with the research

451
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.432
and I saw how crazy people were

452
00:18:35.432 --> 00:18:38.567
and how they beat themselves up over their weight,

453
00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:40.274
for the next three years,

454
00:18:40.274 --> 00:18:42.015
every time I gave a keynote,

455
00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:45.277
I introduced myself by giving my age and my weight.

456
00:18:45.277 --> 00:18:47.611
<v Voiceover>Oh, interesting.</v>
(laughter)

457
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:50.487
<v ->I always got a standing ovation too.</v>

458
00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:53.784
But anyway, yes, but it was sort of like yes,

459
00:18:53.784 --> 00:18:56.420
this is what 168 pounds looks like.

460
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.987
It isn't so bad.

461
00:18:57.987 --> 00:18:59.764
You know, get over it.

462
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.702
Anyway.

463
00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:05.557
So but basically,

464
00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:06.904
I think what we do wrong

465
00:19:06.904 --> 00:19:10.665
with any kind of motivational sort of coaching

466
00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:14.543
or nagging or encouraging or

467
00:19:14.543 --> 00:19:18.409
is we talk only to this part of the brain.

468
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:20.011
It's the same thing that I was saying

469
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:22.682
about the terror with surgery.

470
00:19:22.682 --> 00:19:25.793
This part of the brain can understand what you need to do,

471
00:19:25.793 --> 00:19:28.185
it can make perfect logical sense,

472
00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:31.494
but it doesn't cohere the whole human being

473
00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:34.869
behind the intention to do something different

474
00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:39.438
and it's also it tends to be preachy,

475
00:19:39.438 --> 00:19:40.831
little bit like this,

476
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:44.337
and we know, motivational psychologists know

477
00:19:44.337 --> 00:19:46.427
that you want to encourage somebody to do something

478
00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:49.074
you use the carrots, not the sticks.

479
00:19:49.074 --> 00:19:51.680
So with this imagery, what I do,

480
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.840
oh and the other thing about weight loss

481
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.347
is people start really disliking themselves.

482
00:19:56.347 --> 00:19:59.656
There's a certain loagy, fatiguey depression that goes--

483
00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:02.222
<v Voiceover>Low self esteem ends up at the root of it.</v>

484
00:20:02.222 --> 00:20:04.358
<v ->And dislike of the body,</v>

485
00:20:04.358 --> 00:20:07.748
which is a killer for weight loss.

486
00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.198
The best place to start, if you possibly can,

487
00:20:10.198 --> 00:20:12.961
is liking your body or liking something about your body

488
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:16.340
because you've gotta be in an alliance with your body,

489
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.896
not at war.

490
00:20:17.896 --> 00:20:21.100
So the imagery allows people to,

491
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.072
actually I use very accurate physiological imagery

492
00:20:24.072 --> 00:20:28.702
about how the body converts fat to energy and I,

493
00:20:28.702 --> 00:20:31.988
it's like this is resources in the bank

494
00:20:31.988 --> 00:20:33.926
and you're just going to put them to use

495
00:20:33.926 --> 00:20:37.723
behind heat, growth, power, strength,

496
00:20:37.723 --> 00:20:39.290
motivation, action

497
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.831
so that it's getting the whole person behind

498
00:20:42.831 --> 00:20:46.500
this conversion of fat to energy.

499
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.564
And I try to portray the way the enzymes

500
00:20:50.564 --> 00:20:53.234
and the proteins and the fat

501
00:20:53.234 --> 00:20:57.471
sort of does this exquisite dance of creation in the body

502
00:20:57.471 --> 00:21:00.072
to release these fabulous resources

503
00:21:00.072 --> 00:21:02.615
so that listening to it,

504
00:21:02.615 --> 00:21:06.655
you couldn't help but be taken with the genius of your body.

505
00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:08.280
So it's sort of a starting place

506
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.090
to start liking your own flesh.

507
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.026
And the other thing I do is I try to have people imagine

508
00:21:15.026 --> 00:21:18.067
moving as a pleasure, which is of course

509
00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:20.969
all of us had that experience as kids.

510
00:21:20.969 --> 00:21:23.210
Kids don't move to get exercise.

511
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.160
They move because they like it.

512
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.270
So remembering the feel of your body in motion

513
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.348
and the pleasure of that.

514
00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:36.348
So I try to get more behind

515
00:21:36.724 --> 00:21:39.650
the positive stuff about losing weight

516
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.321
and it's a good place to start,

517
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:43.794
it's a good motivational place to start

518
00:21:43.794 --> 00:21:45.153
when you're about to embark

519
00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:47.057
on a new behavioral program,

520
00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:50.493
which by the way, goes very nicely with this.

521
00:21:50.493 --> 00:21:53.500
There's a very nice collaboration between

522
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.229
the imagery and other things.

523
00:21:56.229 --> 00:21:58.057
<v Voiceover>What kind of results have you seen</v>

524
00:21:58.057 --> 00:21:59.705
in the weight loss arena?

525
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:03.676
<v ->We had a wonderful pilot study at Canyon Ranch.</v>

526
00:22:03.676 --> 00:22:05.209
It was six weeks.

527
00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:07.481
It was the staff 'cause they were going to use this

528
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:11.046
on their, what do you call them?

529
00:22:11.046 --> 00:22:12.346
You don't call them clients.

530
00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:14.250
The people who come and stay there.

531
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.353
<v Voiceover>Guests.</v>
<v ->Guests.</v>

532
00:22:15.353 --> 00:22:16.688
(laughter)

533
00:22:16.688 --> 00:22:17.959
Thank you.

534
00:22:17.959 --> 00:22:19.120
They were going to use this on their guests.

535
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.932
So they did it.

536
00:22:19.932 --> 00:22:23.903
So there were, I think there were 16 staff people

537
00:22:23.903 --> 00:22:25.633
who were being encouraged

538
00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:27.897
to do behavioral things differently.

539
00:22:27.897 --> 00:22:32.897
But one group were randomly assigned

540
00:22:33.345 --> 00:22:34.936
the imagery

541
00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:37.107
and the other group just got the music

542
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:39.266
behind the imagery, but no imagery.

543
00:22:39.266 --> 00:22:41.147
So they both had the same amount of time

544
00:22:41.147 --> 00:22:45.222
listening to audio, but one had this imagery component

545
00:22:45.222 --> 00:22:47.950
and that group lost twice as much weight,

546
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.796
exactly twice as much weight,

547
00:22:49.796 --> 00:22:53.024
within eight weeks, within eight weeks.

548
00:22:53.024 --> 00:22:56.135
So now it's too small a sample.

549
00:22:56.135 --> 00:22:57.424
It's too small a sample.

550
00:22:57.424 --> 00:22:58.469
<v Voiceover>It's still impressive.</v>

551
00:22:58.469 --> 00:23:00.199
<v ->It is impressive, but it can be skewed</v>

552
00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:02.997
because one person could lose a ton of weight

553
00:23:02.997 --> 00:23:05.098
and bring up the whole average for everybody else.

554
00:23:05.098 --> 00:23:08.639
So those numbers aren't very impressive statistically,

555
00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:11.681
but yes, and pretty soon everybody started talking

556
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:15.242
to each other and they said, "We want the other tape."

557
00:23:15.242 --> 00:23:17.285
You know, "To hell with this music stuff.

558
00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:20.486
"Give me the imagery."

559
00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:22.495
<v Voiceover>But you found that there was also a certain</v>

560
00:23:22.495 --> 00:23:24.898
cut-off point in terms of the amount of weight loss

561
00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:28.393
where guided imagery works fabulously for what,

562
00:23:28.393 --> 00:23:32.372
the average person who says I have to lose 15, 20 pounds.

563
00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:33.231
<v ->Yes, that's great.</v>

564
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:34.566
It works great for that.

565
00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:35.507
It's terrific.

566
00:23:35.507 --> 00:23:38.769
It's, and actually this is consistent with other findings

567
00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.406
for other techniques.

568
00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:43.773
With morbidly obese people

569
00:23:43.773 --> 00:23:47.082
who are really having struggles

570
00:23:47.082 --> 00:23:51.850
with 250, 350 pound weight,

571
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.844
it won't work beyond 25 pounds

572
00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:55.922
just like everything else doesn't work.

573
00:23:55.922 --> 00:23:59.092
There's something metabolic that's different

574
00:23:59.092 --> 00:24:00.694
as a result of carrying the weight

575
00:24:00.694 --> 00:24:03.829
that makes it very hard to lose beyond a certain point.

576
00:24:03.829 --> 00:24:06.070
<v Voiceover>But up to 25 seems to work pretty well.</v>

577
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.868
<v ->25 is good, 25 is good.</v>

578
00:24:08.868 --> 00:24:10.563
<v Voiceover>25's good.</v>

579
00:24:10.563 --> 00:24:14.069
Let's get into another area

580
00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:16.844
before we get to the big one you're into now.

581
00:24:16.844 --> 00:24:19.142
Just briefly if we can touch through

582
00:24:19.142 --> 00:24:22.382
what you do with people who are ready

583
00:24:22.382 --> 00:24:25.888
to make their transition to the other side--

584
00:24:25.888 --> 00:24:28.419
<v ->In other words, die, right.</v>

585
00:24:28.419 --> 00:24:29.324
<v Voiceover>Yes, the physical--</v>

586
00:24:29.324 --> 00:24:31.995
<v ->Say the die word, yes.</v>

587
00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:34.491
Yes, actually it's another place

588
00:24:34.491 --> 00:24:37.266
where imagery has a unique contribution to make

589
00:24:37.266 --> 00:24:41.666
because this is something it's very hard to talk about.

590
00:24:41.666 --> 00:24:45.044
Most people struggle with what could be good about this

591
00:24:45.044 --> 00:24:47.773
except the very religious people

592
00:24:47.773 --> 00:24:50.571
who do feel that there's something very good

593
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:51.906
waiting for them.

594
00:24:51.906 --> 00:24:53.984
And so basically you can use imagery

595
00:24:53.984 --> 00:24:57.485
to help people

596
00:24:57.485 --> 00:24:59.920
resolve relational issues

597
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.519
that have been hanging over their heads.

598
00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:04.262
This is often what keeps people hanging on.

599
00:25:04.262 --> 00:25:08.291
You know, the absence of an apology

600
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.228
or the worry about somebody

601
00:25:11.228 --> 00:25:13.434
that you want to really advise them

602
00:25:13.434 --> 00:25:15.907
or give them the gift of your wisdom to

603
00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:18.670
and they're not listening to it.

604
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.107
So you know, resolving relationships.

605
00:25:22.107 --> 00:25:26.449
You can do that in this magical space of the imaginal world

606
00:25:26.449 --> 00:25:30.222
and you can sort of feel completed,

607
00:25:30.222 --> 00:25:33.322
whether that person is there or not.

608
00:25:33.322 --> 00:25:37.395
You know, and one could argue that they are there,

609
00:25:37.395 --> 00:25:39.764
they're that a different level.

610
00:25:39.764 --> 00:25:44.466
So you do get, you can take people through this process

611
00:25:44.466 --> 00:25:48.773
of asking for forgiveness, providing forgiveness,

612
00:25:48.773 --> 00:25:51.478
giving advice, giving a great big hug,

613
00:25:51.478 --> 00:25:56.478
and then seeing themselves as divesting themselves

614
00:25:56.482 --> 00:25:58.886
of their great love for all of these people

615
00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:00.581
that keep them attached here

616
00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:02.589
so that you can move on,

617
00:26:02.589 --> 00:26:04.958
not loving them any less,

618
00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:07.779
but lighter because you're not carrying it.

619
00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:10.554
And there's reassurance

620
00:26:10.554 --> 00:26:14.199
to the people who are being left behind in hearing this

621
00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:18.669
and also that the idea that this is a point of great peace

622
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:22.535
and calm and they can let go of you

623
00:26:22.535 --> 00:26:27.075
because they know that this is waiting for you too.

624
00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:28.909
<v Voiceover>Well now, do you have them</v>

625
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:30.813
listen to it privately?

626
00:26:30.813 --> 00:26:33.367
Do they listen privately with headsets or in their rooms?

627
00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:37.454
Do they listen to it with their maybe loved ones near them

628
00:26:37.454 --> 00:26:39.451
so you're having this experience together?

629
00:26:39.451 --> 00:26:40.484
How does that work?

630
00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:44.463
<v ->Often, I mean I didn't have any fixed idea in my head,</v>

631
00:26:44.463 --> 00:26:46.124
but what I've heard back

632
00:26:46.124 --> 00:26:49.258
is it's often with people in the room,

633
00:26:49.258 --> 00:26:51.963
the whole family listens, and it's--

634
00:26:51.963 --> 00:26:53.368
<v Voiceover>Very beautiful.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

635
00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:55.435
<v Voiceover>I heard, you let us hear an excerpt of it</v>

636
00:26:55.435 --> 00:26:58.845
and there were a lot of moist eyes in the room,

637
00:26:58.845 --> 00:27:00.772
but it was a beautiful kind of moist eye.

638
00:27:00.772 --> 00:27:05.772
<v ->Yes, I think people also use this to resolve</v>

639
00:27:06.148 --> 00:27:09.074
other losses that have happened quite awhile ago.

640
00:27:09.074 --> 00:27:11.314
I think the people who are crying in the room,

641
00:27:11.314 --> 00:27:14.786
and there were a lot of, there was a lot of sniffling,

642
00:27:14.786 --> 00:27:16.748
often that's because people are thinking about

643
00:27:16.748 --> 00:27:20.591
people they've lost, but in this different framing of it

644
00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:21.392
so that--

645
00:27:21.392 --> 00:27:21.993
<v Voiceover>Very lovely framing.</v>

646
00:27:21.993 --> 00:27:24.860
<v ->Yeah, it's a cushioned, sweet,</v>

647
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.438
reassuring frame for it

648
00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:29.841
that I hope isn't so schmaltzy

649
00:27:29.841 --> 00:27:30.700
that people don't believe it.

650
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.138
<v Voiceover>No, no, no your professionalism comes through.</v>

651
00:27:33.138 --> 00:27:34.578
I mean, it's not schmaltzy,

652
00:27:34.578 --> 00:27:38.641
but it is definitely heart touching.

653
00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:39.814
I want to get to the area

654
00:27:39.814 --> 00:27:42.414
that you're really involving yourself in now,

655
00:27:42.414 --> 00:27:45.421
which is post-traumatic stress syndrome

656
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:49.450
and this encompasses everything from

657
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.354
veterans returning from war,

658
00:27:51.354 --> 00:27:56.068
who are in a severe state of emotional and physical shock,

659
00:27:56.068 --> 00:27:57.995
to people who've been in car accidents

660
00:27:57.995 --> 00:27:59.632
and everything in between.

661
00:27:59.632 --> 00:28:02.175
Can you go ahead and just begin,

662
00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:04.206
whatever's interesting you in this

663
00:28:04.206 --> 00:28:06.436
and you mentioned many things in there

664
00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:08.769
and I want to finally get to the story of Andy at the end,

665
00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:11.277
but maybe start with the Duke--

666
00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:12.748
<v ->Study.</v>

667
00:28:12.748 --> 00:28:15.047
We have a big study going on right now

668
00:28:15.047 --> 00:28:17.612
funded by the Department of Defense

669
00:28:17.612 --> 00:28:21.316
where women veterans

670
00:28:21.316 --> 00:28:25.380
who are suffering from military sexual trauma,

671
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.214
which is hideous.

672
00:28:27.214 --> 00:28:29.536
It's hideous because most of them

673
00:28:29.536 --> 00:28:32.137
have been repeatedly assaulted,

674
00:28:32.137 --> 00:28:34.400
usually by their superior officers,

675
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.502
and they have combat stress as well.

676
00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:38.568
So it's in this horrible situation

677
00:28:38.568 --> 00:28:40.438
where you're feeling unsafe anyway

678
00:28:40.438 --> 00:28:43.479
and then the person who's supposed to be your protector

679
00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:46.510
is your predator and it's going on all the time

680
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.815
and you can't talk about it because

681
00:28:49.815 --> 00:28:51.615
then you get punished even more.

682
00:28:51.615 --> 00:28:56.155
So these are cases of very severe post-traumatic stress

683
00:28:56.155 --> 00:29:00.729
and basically the women are given,

684
00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:02.633
they're randomly divided,

685
00:29:02.633 --> 00:29:04.613
but they're given...

686
00:29:06.128 --> 00:29:08.659
a 12 week course of self-administered

687
00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:10.633
guided imagery downloads.

688
00:29:10.633 --> 00:29:13.071
Starts off with something that's rather simple

689
00:29:13.071 --> 00:29:16.310
and self-regulating, neutral,

690
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.551
just very cushioned imagery

691
00:29:18.551 --> 00:29:21.685
so that they start to get very good at using this technique

692
00:29:21.685 --> 00:29:26.248
to calm themselves down when they start to get

693
00:29:26.248 --> 00:29:28.686
this emotional arousal

694
00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:33.686
and then they switch to the much more intense

695
00:29:34.654 --> 00:29:36.662
guided imagery for traumatic stress

696
00:29:36.662 --> 00:29:39.228
where you basically enter your broken heart,

697
00:29:39.228 --> 00:29:41.539
you see your symptoms as landscape,

698
00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:43.466
and then you dive even deeper into yourself

699
00:29:43.466 --> 00:29:46.078
to a place that is truly undiminished

700
00:29:46.078 --> 00:29:49.128
by all these horrible things that have happened.

701
00:29:49.128 --> 00:29:51.438
And there's sort of a quasi soul retrieval

702
00:29:51.438 --> 00:29:52.274
that happens in there.

703
00:29:52.274 --> 00:29:53.215
It's hard to describe.

704
00:29:53.215 --> 00:29:56.013
It sounds a little strange just describing it,

705
00:29:56.013 --> 00:29:58.985
but it works as a story

706
00:29:58.985 --> 00:30:02.758
and it works as an imaginary hero's journey.

707
00:30:02.758 --> 00:30:06.462
So they get the 12 weeks of guided imagery,

708
00:30:06.462 --> 00:30:08.192
listening to it once a day.

709
00:30:08.192 --> 00:30:09.527
There's no therapist.

710
00:30:09.527 --> 00:30:13.938
There's a social worker who introduces it to them

711
00:30:13.938 --> 00:30:16.040
and then she calls once a week to say,

712
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.224
"Are you listening to your imagery?

713
00:30:17.224 --> 00:30:18.211
"How's it going?"

714
00:30:18.211 --> 00:30:20.278
That's it.

715
00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:22.344
The results of these 12 weeks

716
00:30:22.344 --> 00:30:26.744
have phenomenal reductions in symptoms

717
00:30:26.744 --> 00:30:29.682
in all three symptom clusters of PTSD

718
00:30:29.682 --> 00:30:33.451
and they're comparable to the best kind of cognitive

719
00:30:33.451 --> 00:30:36.226
behavioral treatment we have for PTSD

720
00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:38.862
with a therapist for 12 weeks.

721
00:30:38.862 --> 00:30:39.663
So again--

722
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:40.986
<v Voiceover>For the price of a download.</v>

723
00:30:40.986 --> 00:30:45.035
<v ->Exactly, or bootleg, which is no price. (laughs)</v>

724
00:30:45.035 --> 00:30:47.601
And that excites the practical side of my brain

725
00:30:47.601 --> 00:30:49.702
that says we could be doing this everywhere.

726
00:30:49.702 --> 00:30:52.663
This is totally feasible.

727
00:30:52.663 --> 00:30:54.869
Anyway, so that was very exciting.

728
00:30:54.869 --> 00:30:58.410
And as I said earlier, the symptom clusters,

729
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.941
one big one is arousal,

730
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:05.941
which means big spikes in terror or fury,

731
00:31:06.316 --> 00:31:09.079
which is the result of these

732
00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:11.459
insanely swinging neuro hormones

733
00:31:11.459 --> 00:31:13.189
that are going back and forth

734
00:31:13.189 --> 00:31:17.264
and one side of the pendulum is intense,

735
00:31:17.264 --> 00:31:22.264
adrenergized, activated emotions

736
00:31:22.698 --> 00:31:26.169
that are mostly terror and fury.

737
00:31:26.169 --> 00:31:27.876
So that's one symptom cluster

738
00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:32.876
that had marked, statistically significant reduction

739
00:31:32.984 --> 00:31:35.782
very much like cognitive behavioral therapy.

740
00:31:35.782 --> 00:31:39.416
And on the other side, another symptom cluster

741
00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:42.493
is numbing and avoidance.

742
00:31:42.493 --> 00:31:47.356
You're kind of stoned on endogenous opioids,

743
00:31:47.356 --> 00:31:49.862
which is the body's way of trying to mediate

744
00:31:49.862 --> 00:31:52.636
these crazy adrenaline symptoms.

745
00:31:52.636 --> 00:31:55.237
So you're kind of gorked out,

746
00:31:55.237 --> 00:31:59.777
you look stoned, your concentration is bad,

747
00:31:59.777 --> 00:32:01.460
and you're out of it and you're isolated

748
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.014
and you don't talk to people and you avoid things,

749
00:32:04.014 --> 00:32:05.210
you don't go to work, or you go to work

750
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.149
and you keep your door shut the whole time,

751
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:09.007
or you don't leave the house.

752
00:32:09.007 --> 00:32:10.121
So that's the other side.

753
00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:12.188
Those symptoms were also alleviated

754
00:32:12.188 --> 00:32:15.949
very much the same as cognitive behavioral therapy.

755
00:32:15.949 --> 00:32:18.689
The really exciting thing is

756
00:32:18.689 --> 00:32:20.826
the symptom cluster that is traditionally

757
00:32:20.826 --> 00:32:25.295
the hardest to treat, the stickiest to stick around,

758
00:32:25.295 --> 00:32:27.397
the stuff that doesn't go away,

759
00:32:27.397 --> 00:32:29.835
which is called reexperiencing,

760
00:32:29.835 --> 00:32:34.537
that's flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts.

761
00:32:34.537 --> 00:32:38.833
Those were the most dramatically improved

762
00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:41.410
and that's amazing, but it makes sense

763
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.883
because the imagery goes to the part of the brain

764
00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:46.646
that is producing these horrible images

765
00:32:46.646 --> 00:32:48.620
and it's kind of bumping them out of there

766
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.022
with different images that are much more healing

767
00:32:52.022 --> 00:32:55.168
and speak to the issue.

768
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:57.971
<v Voiceover>Andy,</v>

769
00:32:57.971 --> 00:33:01.466
which is one very dramatic,

770
00:33:01.466 --> 00:33:03.706
it's a powerful story.

771
00:33:03.706 --> 00:33:04.740
<v ->It's a heartbreaking story.</v>

772
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.645
<v Voiceover>It's a heartbreaking story,</v>

773
00:33:05.645 --> 00:33:07.480
but a very powerful story

774
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.473
to look at the degree to which this can be effective

775
00:33:11.473 --> 00:33:13.819
in even some of the most horrific situations.

776
00:33:13.819 --> 00:33:14.643
<v ->Yes.</v>

777
00:33:14.643 --> 00:33:16.849
<v Voiceover>So if you could just tell Andy's story.</v>

778
00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:17.789
<v ->The Andy story.</v>

779
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:22.789
Well, Andy was in a group of Vietnam veterans

780
00:33:23.223 --> 00:33:25.858
who were what we call dual diagnosis.

781
00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:30.154
They were all in recovery for massive substance abuse

782
00:33:30.154 --> 00:33:33.196
and had been through a program that dried them out

783
00:33:33.196 --> 00:33:36.435
and then if they qualified they entered this

784
00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:38.768
called Transcend Vietnam program.

785
00:33:38.768 --> 00:33:41.613
This was at the Louis B. Stokes VA Hospital

786
00:33:41.613 --> 00:33:43.447
in Brecksville, Ohio.

787
00:33:43.447 --> 00:33:47.778
So Andy was one of these guys,

788
00:33:47.778 --> 00:33:50.982
very, very much a leader.

789
00:33:50.982 --> 00:33:52.724
He was so tuned into himself

790
00:33:52.724 --> 00:33:55.487
and he was so authentic

791
00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:57.217
that he was a natural leader.

792
00:33:57.217 --> 00:33:58.598
And as I said this morning,

793
00:33:58.598 --> 00:34:00.827
he's the kind of person you would pay

794
00:34:00.827 --> 00:34:02.569
to have in your therapy group

795
00:34:02.569 --> 00:34:05.971
'cause he catalyzes all kinds of movement

796
00:34:05.971 --> 00:34:09.105
and speaks for everybody and tells the truth

797
00:34:09.105 --> 00:34:11.334
and you could tell, even though I think at the time

798
00:34:11.334 --> 00:34:15.580
he was in his 40's, now he's in his 50's,

799
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.415
but oh maybe he's in his 60's.

800
00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:19.841
Anyway, whatever he was,

801
00:34:19.841 --> 00:34:21.246
he 'was like an 18-year-old kid still.

802
00:34:21.246 --> 00:34:24.148
You could see where he got his development was arrested

803
00:34:24.148 --> 00:34:28.653
and he still had this sort of sweet, unformed

804
00:34:28.653 --> 00:34:32.554
18-year-old blue collar kid flavor to him

805
00:34:32.554 --> 00:34:34.493
that was very appealing.

806
00:34:34.493 --> 00:34:38.429
Anyway, so Andy's in this group

807
00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:39.996
and at some point in the group,

808
00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:42.597
the group all becomes very skilled at guided imagery,

809
00:34:42.597 --> 00:34:45.673
they do a lot of other things, they do journaling,

810
00:34:45.673 --> 00:34:46.846
but one of the things they do

811
00:34:46.846 --> 00:34:48.680
is towards the end of the group,

812
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.550
and it was an eight-week group,

813
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.311
they talk about their trauma or some core traumas

814
00:34:54.311 --> 00:34:57.388
and Andy never knew until the last minute

815
00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:58.955
whether he was even gonna talk about this

816
00:34:58.955 --> 00:35:00.650
because he had never talked about it,

817
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.519
it was so horrible.

818
00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:05.793
But at the very tail end of the final session

819
00:35:05.793 --> 00:35:08.232
he tells his story, which is

820
00:35:08.232 --> 00:35:11.436
he's walking point, which is what you do

821
00:35:11.436 --> 00:35:14.536
when you send somebody out ahead of everybody else

822
00:35:14.536 --> 00:35:18.274
to make sure that things are safe for the group to proceed.

823
00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:21.641
He was one of these guys who became

824
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:25.008
sort of wildly, mystically attuned to the environment.

825
00:35:25.008 --> 00:35:27.411
He could smell danger.

826
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:31.417
He was so, and he would become elated at this job.

827
00:35:31.417 --> 00:35:32.752
Nobody else wanted to walk point,

828
00:35:32.752 --> 00:35:34.284
but he always volunteered.

829
00:35:34.284 --> 00:35:39.284
And he had this very attuned

830
00:35:39.962 --> 00:35:43.561
and exquisite sensibility walking point

831
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:45.395
and I think that's because he had so much adrenaline

832
00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:48.599
going through him that he was in this psychic,

833
00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:51.200
intuitive state of mind.

834
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.837
Anyway, and people thought he was crazy

835
00:35:52.837 --> 00:35:54.904
'cause he would walk point not with a machine gun,

836
00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:57.481
but with a single rocket launcher because

837
00:35:57.481 --> 00:36:00.685
(laughs) okay.

838
00:36:00.685 --> 00:36:05.685
But basically everybody thought Andy was nuts,

839
00:36:05.782 --> 00:36:07.918
but they always liked it better when he walked point

840
00:36:07.918 --> 00:36:10.786
'cause they knew that they were safe with him,

841
00:36:10.786 --> 00:36:13.097
in his little 18-year-old hands.

842
00:36:13.097 --> 00:36:18.097
Anyway, so he had this unique role in his group

843
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.104
and at one point, this was the trauma,

844
00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:26.042
they come across a 10-year-old girl

845
00:36:26.042 --> 00:36:31.042
who was not supposed to know any Americans were there.

846
00:36:31.475 --> 00:36:36.475
They knew that if she was allowed to live

847
00:36:36.537 --> 00:36:39.114
that she would reveal their location,

848
00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:41.460
hundreds of troops would be killed.

849
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.525
So they were being, basically this group of men

850
00:36:44.525 --> 00:36:46.255
were being given a choice

851
00:36:46.255 --> 00:36:49.529
that no one should ever have to make

852
00:36:49.529 --> 00:36:53.197
and they tied her up to a tree.

853
00:36:53.197 --> 00:36:54.997
They tried, nobody knew what to do,

854
00:36:54.997 --> 00:36:57.156
so they just shuffled around.

855
00:36:57.156 --> 00:36:58.875
Nobody wanted to hurt her.

856
00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:02.567
And as usual, Andy, in his leadership way,

857
00:37:02.567 --> 00:37:04.482
stepped, came forward,

858
00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:06.050
everybody else backed off,

859
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.383
got as far away from there as they could,

860
00:37:08.383 --> 00:37:10.682
and he just squatted

861
00:37:10.682 --> 00:37:12.551
about a foot and a half away from this girl

862
00:37:12.551 --> 00:37:15.686
and just stared her in the eye

863
00:37:15.686 --> 00:37:19.889
and was trying to sort of commune with her

864
00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:21.514
and see what her intentions were,

865
00:37:21.514 --> 00:37:26.332
if there was anything they could do to let her go.

866
00:37:26.332 --> 00:37:31.034
And they had this intense eyeball to eyeball contact

867
00:37:31.034 --> 00:37:33.739
and basically what he saw was

868
00:37:33.739 --> 00:37:38.546
this steely, flinty little warrior girl

869
00:37:38.546 --> 00:37:41.112
who was basically looking him in the eye

870
00:37:41.112 --> 00:37:45.477
and saying with her eyes, "Go to hell."

871
00:37:45.477 --> 00:37:49.726
So he knew that this was the problem

872
00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:51.387
and at some point, he doesn't,

873
00:37:51.387 --> 00:37:54.219
and he also felt that this was a perfect mirror.

874
00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:56.425
This was, he was looking at himself,

875
00:37:56.425 --> 00:37:59.885
this incredibly intelligent

876
00:37:59.885 --> 00:38:04.204
and vitally courageous little girl.

877
00:38:04.204 --> 00:38:09.173
So at some point, and he isn't sure what it was,

878
00:38:09.173 --> 00:38:11.646
it might have been 10 minutes, it might have been an hour,

879
00:38:11.646 --> 00:38:13.678
he slit her throat with his knife

880
00:38:13.678 --> 00:38:16.151
and walked back to the other men

881
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:18.821
with her blood on his hands

882
00:38:18.821 --> 00:38:20.551
and they wouldn't look at him.

883
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:21.921
Nobody spoke about it.

884
00:38:21.921 --> 00:38:25.195
They never spoke about it and they just kept going.

885
00:38:25.195 --> 00:38:28.701
And Andy's traumatic, intrusive memory

886
00:38:28.701 --> 00:38:31.197
and his nightmares and his flashbacks

887
00:38:31.197 --> 00:38:33.972
were of this little girl's eyes,

888
00:38:33.972 --> 00:38:38.070
staring at him, following him, accusing him,

889
00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.944
and never giving him a moment's peace,

890
00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:44.278
asleep or awake.

891
00:38:44.278 --> 00:38:46.716
So Andy basically did some imagery,

892
00:38:46.716 --> 00:38:48.945
one-on-one imagery in the room

893
00:38:48.945 --> 00:38:53.926
where he met with this girl again

894
00:38:53.926 --> 00:38:57.757
and he asked her forgiveness,

895
00:38:57.757 --> 00:39:02.757
told her his great sorrow about having done his regret,

896
00:39:03.222 --> 00:39:06.252
about having done what he did to her,

897
00:39:06.252 --> 00:39:08.400
telling her how much he admired her courage

898
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.610
and her strength and her steeliness

899
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.640
and how much he connected to that

900
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.169
and basically told her he was sorry,

901
00:39:18.169 --> 00:39:19.981
he was so sorry.

902
00:39:19.981 --> 00:39:24.981
And the shift came when right after doing that imagery.

903
00:39:25.182 --> 00:39:26.680
What he reported was

904
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.559
the girl's eyes were still following him,

905
00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:31.927
but they were eyes of forgiveness,

906
00:39:31.927 --> 00:39:33.657
they were very sorrowful,

907
00:39:33.657 --> 00:39:35.724
and they were basically eyes that said,

908
00:39:35.724 --> 00:39:37.187
"I know what you've been through

909
00:39:37.187 --> 00:39:40.658
"and you shouldn't have had to have been through this."

910
00:39:40.658 --> 00:39:42.005
And so they were not just,

911
00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:44.838
they weren't these eyes that accused him.

912
00:39:44.838 --> 00:39:47.636
He now had eyes that were his companions

913
00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:50.097
and provided him with huge solace.

914
00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:52.581
And I have to tell you, this was a long time ago

915
00:39:52.581 --> 00:39:54.311
that I heard this story.

916
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:59.311
This was like in close to I think it was 1999.

917
00:40:00.012 --> 00:40:04.795
But I just got a picture of Andy,

918
00:40:04.795 --> 00:40:06.490
that's not his real name,

919
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.555
I just got a picture of Andy and his new girlfriend

920
00:40:09.555 --> 00:40:11.831
in his location, in his new city,

921
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:13.572
and he just looked like a different person.

922
00:40:13.572 --> 00:40:15.465
He didn't look like an 18-year-old kid anymore.

923
00:40:15.465 --> 00:40:16.925
He looked like a guy.

924
00:40:16.925 --> 00:40:19.293
He looked like a guy almost his own age

925
00:40:19.293 --> 00:40:21.174
and very happy

926
00:40:21.174 --> 00:40:22.671
and a very sweet note.

927
00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:24.041
<v Voiceover>Aw, very sweet note.</v>

928
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:26.445
Now that's something that, as you say,

929
00:40:26.445 --> 00:40:27.942
no one should have to live through.

930
00:40:27.942 --> 00:40:28.616
<v ->No.</v>

931
00:40:28.616 --> 00:40:33.585
<v Voiceover>And yet, even he was able to turn this into</v>

932
00:40:33.585 --> 00:40:36.044
an experience that ended up being his friend.

933
00:40:36.044 --> 00:40:39.596
<v ->Yes, and it allowed him to forgive himself.</v>

934
00:40:39.596 --> 00:40:43.068
And let me tell you, this is not that unusual an experience.

935
00:40:43.068 --> 00:40:46.969
Our guys are coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq

936
00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:49.035
having had to make these choices

937
00:40:49.035 --> 00:40:52.135
or having been completely in some kind of war fog,

938
00:40:52.135 --> 00:40:55.212
out of control, doing things they never would have done--

939
00:40:55.212 --> 00:40:56.315
<v Voiceover>And they take it home.</v>

940
00:40:56.315 --> 00:40:58.044
And you're talking violence at home,

941
00:40:58.044 --> 00:40:59.879
you're talking a lot of problems.

942
00:40:59.879 --> 00:41:01.446
<v ->Yeah, and suicide at home,</v>

943
00:41:01.446 --> 00:41:03.014
and self hatred at home,

944
00:41:03.014 --> 00:41:06.020
and absolute disconnect from self at home.

945
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.852
And these things need to be addressed

946
00:41:09.852 --> 00:41:11.454
in a way that helps.

947
00:41:11.454 --> 00:41:12.661
Talking about it won't help.

948
00:41:12.661 --> 00:41:14.798
Most of these people can't talk about it.

949
00:41:14.798 --> 00:41:16.957
Yesterday at a workshop, someone came up to me

950
00:41:16.957 --> 00:41:21.032
and said that her son, who came back from Iraq,

951
00:41:21.032 --> 00:41:22.634
got the guided imagery

952
00:41:22.634 --> 00:41:26.175
and he's listened to it 700 times.

953
00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:27.708
That's all he wants to do.

954
00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:28.637
Now, some people do that.

955
00:41:28.637 --> 00:41:30.297
They just listen to it over and over again

956
00:41:30.297 --> 00:41:33.246
until it thunks in and makes the shift.

957
00:41:33.246 --> 00:41:34.686
<v Voiceover>It's probably the only relief.</v>

958
00:41:34.686 --> 00:41:35.614
<v ->Yeah.</v>

959
00:41:35.614 --> 00:41:37.553
But other people, and other people find it

960
00:41:37.553 --> 00:41:39.550
a little bit too intense right away.

961
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.454
They have to titrate the dosage.

962
00:41:41.454 --> 00:41:43.823
They listen to it a little bit more each day.

963
00:41:43.823 --> 00:41:46.493
And other people,

964
00:41:46.493 --> 00:41:48.025
other people don't need it.

965
00:41:48.025 --> 00:41:50.266
Other people come home and there's something

966
00:41:50.266 --> 00:41:53.227
in their nervous system and their biochemistr

967
00:41:53.227 --> 00:41:54.701
that settles out.

968
00:41:54.701 --> 00:41:56.907
A lot of this is physiologic.

969
00:41:56.907 --> 00:42:00.274
<v Voiceover>I've read about this, the phenomena,</v>

970
00:42:00.274 --> 00:42:03.211
I read about it recently in the paper,

971
00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:05.243
that the people who choose combat,

972
00:42:05.243 --> 00:42:07.519
for example, the really intense forms,

973
00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:09.713
the SEALs, Green Berets and so forth,

974
00:42:09.713 --> 00:42:13.521
don't experience this kind of stress in their beings.

975
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:15.994
They're prepared for it, they're wired for it,

976
00:42:15.994 --> 00:42:17.027
they're ready for it.

977
00:42:17.027 --> 00:42:18.455
Those who are drafted,

978
00:42:18.455 --> 00:42:19.953
those who end up there when they thought

979
00:42:19.953 --> 00:42:24.234
they were gonna just be in Fort Dix or whatever,

980
00:42:24.234 --> 00:42:25.429
whole different deal.

981
00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:26.231
<v ->Right, that's true.</v>

982
00:42:26.231 --> 00:42:27.635
<v Voiceover>Didn't really up for this</v>

983
00:42:27.635 --> 00:42:29.365
and they're not prepared.

984
00:42:29.365 --> 00:42:31.533
<v ->For the most part, but not,</v>

985
00:42:31.533 --> 00:42:34.644
there are so many anomalies that even to say

986
00:42:34.644 --> 00:42:38.174
there are Marines, there are SEALS who get PTSD,

987
00:42:38.174 --> 00:42:41.448
but it does, generally speaking, take more.

988
00:42:41.448 --> 00:42:44.426
Women are twice as likely to get PTSD as men.

989
00:42:44.426 --> 00:42:48.211
Children are twice as likely to get PTSD as adults.

990
00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:50.718
Some of it has to do with just the neurophysiology,

991
00:42:50.718 --> 00:42:51.995
the way the brain is wired,

992
00:42:51.995 --> 00:42:55.664
and the way the biolchemicals get mixed.

993
00:42:55.664 --> 00:42:57.696
So a lot of it's in the hardwiring

994
00:42:57.696 --> 00:43:01.330
and people tend to blame themselves for getting PTSD.

995
00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.499
They say, "Oh I should have known,"

996
00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:04.798
or for whatever happened they should have known better,

997
00:43:04.798 --> 00:43:08.362
"I should have been smarter, I should have been wiser."

998
00:43:08.362 --> 00:43:10.475
It's not a choice.

999
00:43:10.475 --> 00:43:12.078
<v Voiceover>And this is something that encompasses</v>

1000
00:43:12.078 --> 00:43:15.711
all of the truly shocking events of our lives,

1001
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:17.186
whether it is a car accident

1002
00:43:17.186 --> 00:43:18.858
or whether it's even emotional trauma

1003
00:43:18.858 --> 00:43:20.123
that's been introduced.

1004
00:43:20.123 --> 00:43:22.259
<v ->Yeah, it has to be something,</v>

1005
00:43:22.259 --> 00:43:24.825
I mean to qualify as a catalyst for PTSD,

1006
00:43:24.825 --> 00:43:27.995
it has to be something that turns your life upside down

1007
00:43:27.995 --> 00:43:31.536
and leaves you absolutely without the platform

1008
00:43:31.536 --> 00:43:33.402
you normally stood on,

1009
00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:35.399
you know, without your self identity.

1010
00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:38.302
It just shifts something huge about yourself

1011
00:43:38.302 --> 00:43:41.169
and that could be 9/11, it could be Hurricane Katrina.

1012
00:43:41.169 --> 00:43:43.445
<v Voiceover>Weren't your CDs handed out</v>

1013
00:43:43.445 --> 00:43:44.339
by the Red Cross?
<v ->Yes.</v>

1014
00:43:44.339 --> 00:43:45.512
<v Voiceover>Is that correct?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

1015
00:43:45.512 --> 00:43:48.414
By the Red Cross and by John Jay College of Criminal Justice

1016
00:43:48.414 --> 00:43:51.851
to early responders and survivors at 9/11

1017
00:43:51.851 --> 00:43:53.453
and for the people working on the pile

1018
00:43:53.453 --> 00:43:55.647
for like years afterwards.

1019
00:43:55.647 --> 00:43:59.026
And they're still being handed out.

1020
00:43:59.026 --> 00:44:02.196
There's a lot of the post-traumatic stress from 9/11

1021
00:44:02.196 --> 00:44:05.400
is just emerging now because it does go underground

1022
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.153
in many instances

1023
00:44:07.153 --> 00:44:09.672
and so people who think they're doing okay

1024
00:44:09.672 --> 00:44:12.703
all of the sudden one day, maybe five years later,

1025
00:44:12.703 --> 00:44:13.875
boom.

1026
00:44:13.875 --> 00:44:18.875
So there's a lot of people just reporting PTSD now.

1027
00:44:19.645 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Voiceover>Would you say that on some level,</v>

1028
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.046
to much lesser degrees

1029
00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:26.391
and not to qualify for that particular label,

1030
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:29.224
but most all of us have some kind of trauma

1031
00:44:29.224 --> 00:44:32.927
and wounds in our lives that are unresolved.

1032
00:44:32.927 --> 00:44:35.667
<v ->We all certainly have huge losses</v>

1033
00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:38.930
and greatly stressful experiences,

1034
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:43.632
but post-traumatic stress is a very unique configuration

1035
00:44:43.632 --> 00:44:45.304
of hideous stuff

1036
00:44:45.304 --> 00:44:49.007
and for reasons that sometimes seem arbitrary.

1037
00:44:49.007 --> 00:44:51.631
It gets distinguished from acute stress.

1038
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:54.650
So for instance, after a hurricane

1039
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.715
or a cyclone that are very destructive,

1040
00:44:57.715 --> 00:44:59.851
almost everybody is going to have acute stress

1041
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:02.893
and insane hormone levels

1042
00:45:02.893 --> 00:45:06.062
from four to eight months afterwards,

1043
00:45:06.062 --> 00:45:09.835
but for most people it settles down in and of itself.

1044
00:45:09.835 --> 00:45:12.297
People who go on to get PTSD,

1045
00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:15.966
it just never, the cycling never stops

1046
00:45:15.966 --> 00:45:17.266
and there's something about

1047
00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:20.493
sort of an irritated neuronal network

1048
00:45:20.493 --> 00:45:22.641
or maybe some inherited hardwiring

1049
00:45:22.641 --> 00:45:26.345
that just makes some people more vulnerable

1050
00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:27.645
and there are some things that make people

1051
00:45:27.645 --> 00:45:29.886
less vulnerable.

1052
00:45:29.886 --> 00:45:31.349
<v Voiceover>So, I'm sorry go ahead.</v>

1053
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:34.507
<v ->I was telling you there's a big study of nightclub fires</v>

1054
00:45:34.507 --> 00:45:38.895
that show that people who are inebriated do not get PTSD

1055
00:45:38.895 --> 00:45:42.227
even if they had a horrific experience

1056
00:45:42.227 --> 00:45:44.189
and just got out with their lives

1057
00:45:44.189 --> 00:45:48.740
and are burned horribly, they still don't get PTSD

1058
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:49.867
if they were drunk.

1059
00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:51.202
<v Voiceover>That makes sense, that makes sense</v>

1060
00:45:51.202 --> 00:45:53.245
because it wasn't striking them emotionally

1061
00:45:53.245 --> 00:45:55.811
in that shocking manner as if you were--

1062
00:45:55.811 --> 00:45:59.282
<v ->Or I would take it even a step more primitively</v>

1063
00:45:59.282 --> 00:46:03.148
and say there was some substance

1064
00:46:03.148 --> 00:46:05.923
in their bloodstream that interfered

1065
00:46:05.923 --> 00:46:09.824
with this flooding of biochemicals that normally occurs

1066
00:46:09.824 --> 00:46:11.554
that gets this whole thing rolling.

1067
00:46:11.554 --> 00:46:12.831
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1068
00:46:12.831 --> 00:46:16.001
Well, where are you headed right now

1069
00:46:16.001 --> 00:46:17.789
with your work in this area?

1070
00:46:17.789 --> 00:46:19.519
<v ->Well, we're extending the study</v>

1071
00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:23.025
and now at the Durham VA Hospital

1072
00:46:23.025 --> 00:46:25.637
the next study has, the extended study,

1073
00:46:25.637 --> 00:46:27.599
has started with many more people,

1074
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:29.178
more kinds of trauma.

1075
00:46:29.178 --> 00:46:32.348
We're taking functional MRIs of their brains

1076
00:46:32.348 --> 00:46:35.285
before this and after.

1077
00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:37.154
We expect to see differences.

1078
00:46:37.154 --> 00:46:41.647
And we're taking a very complicated

1079
00:46:41.647 --> 00:46:45.664
neurosteroid markers in the blood before and after

1080
00:46:45.664 --> 00:46:50.664
so that we can really point to some very basic shifts

1081
00:46:50.865 --> 00:46:54.232
that happen as a result of listening to guided imagery.

1082
00:46:54.232 --> 00:46:58.400
We're also, I'll be part of a project that is training

1083
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.011
these ill-prepared National Guard's men,

1084
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:04.612
some Army, and some Marines,

1085
00:47:04.612 --> 00:47:06.980
better prepared Marines and Army,

1086
00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:10.022
at Fort Carson in Colorado before they're deployed

1087
00:47:10.022 --> 00:47:12.147
to see if by teaching them imagery,

1088
00:47:12.147 --> 00:47:15.490
yoga, acupressure, will that help them?

1089
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:18.962
Will it mitigate symptoms of PTSD?

1090
00:47:18.962 --> 00:47:20.529
Will it inoculate them?

1091
00:47:20.529 --> 00:47:23.699
We don't know, but we think it might.

1092
00:47:23.699 --> 00:47:25.231
We know it helps after.

1093
00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:27.170
Maybe it could help before.

1094
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.467
So very exciting. (laughs)

1095
00:47:30.467 --> 00:47:33.295
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1096
00:47:34.298 --> 00:47:36.539
<v ->I found her CDs to be exquisite</v>

1097
00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:38.304
both in quality and content.

1098
00:47:38.304 --> 00:47:41.009
Just go to her website below to access meditations

1099
00:47:41.009 --> 00:47:43.250
for more than 40 different conditions.

1100
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.013
Now, other interviews you would likely find interesting

1101
00:47:46.013 --> 00:47:48.486
are those with Teri Mahaney, John Demartini,

1102
00:47:48.486 --> 00:47:50.053
and Robert Tennyson Stevens,

1103
00:47:50.053 --> 00:47:52.189
all available here on CMN.

1104
00:47:52.189 --> 00:47:54.987
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1105
00:47:54.987 --> 00:47:57.745
(relaxing music)
