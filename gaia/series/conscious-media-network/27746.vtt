00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:03.651
<v ->Pamela Cayton spent 10 years of her life in Nepal,</v>

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:05.673
serving as a teacher in an orphanage.

3
00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:06.633
Little did she know

4
00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.231
that these children were going to forever change her life

5
00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:12.271
and her relationship to the field of education.

6
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:13.711
Upon her return to the west,

7
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.411
she settled in Silicon Valley,

8
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:18.892
180 degrees off her previous experience.

9
00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:22.112
Shocked at the lack of genuine curiosity from the children

10
00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.812
and their sense of entitlement,

11
00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:26.372
she began to devise a new system of teaching

12
00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:28.412
called essential education,

13
00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:31.143
which allows children to learn through the understanding

14
00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:34.483
of the interconnectedness of all things.

15
00:00:35.263 --> 00:00:39.443 line:15% 
(light music)

16
00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:45.605
<v Voiceover>I was listening to your talk</v>

17
00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:46.606
a little while ago

18
00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:50.137
and I just, I found what you were saying so compelling,

19
00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:53.977
because you had a personal journey in education

20
00:00:53.977 --> 00:00:57.777
where you had been with a monastery in,

21
00:00:57.777 --> 00:00:59.917
was it, were you in Nepal, Tibet, where were you?

22
00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:00.657
<v ->In Nepal.</v>

23
00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:01.269
<v Voiceover>In Nepal.</v>

24
00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:01.809
<v ->Uh hmm.</v>

25
00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:02.809
<v Voiceover>For 10 years.</v>

26
00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:03.689
<v ->Uh hmm.</v>

27
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:04.855
<v Voiceover>And now you come back to the United States</v>

28
00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:06.655
and you're trying to find proper education

29
00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:08.447
for your young children,

30
00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:09.947
and this was quite startling

31
00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:11.907
because you ended up in Silicon Valley.

32
00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:13.227
<v ->Uh hmm.</v>

33
00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:17.507
<v Voiceover>And the huge chasm</v>

34
00:01:17.507 --> 00:01:19.387
between the understandings

35
00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:22.247
and levels of compassion, appreciation

36
00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:25.287
and everything that you had experienced in Nepal

37
00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:26.647
and what you experienced here,

38
00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:27.947
were so dramatically different

39
00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:30.087
you had to start your own school system.

40
00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:30.569
<v ->Uh hmm.</v>

41
00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.059
<v Voiceover>So can you pick the journey up from there.</v>

42
00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.681
<v ->From there? From when I...</v>

43
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:36.921
<v Voiceover>From when you landed in Silicon Valley,</v>

44
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.221
what you started noticing

45
00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:42.161
as differences between the children that you had been with

46
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:45.221
among the Nepalese people in the monastery,

47
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:46.701
and what you found in Silicon Valley

48
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.321
at a time when it was quite wealthy.

49
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:51.221
<v ->Uh hmm. And I was actually on the edge of Silicon Valley,</v>

50
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:54.441
in a beautiful idyllic little area

51
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:56.061
to raise children as it turned out,

52
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.501
in Santa Cruz, California.

53
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.781
But it was also actually going through huge changes too,

54
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:03.961
because a lot of the people who worked in Silicon Valley,

55
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.641
the dot-commers, were coming to buy property in Santa Cruz,

56
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:12.121
so the whole face of that economy and environment

57
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.601
was changing dramatically as a result.

58
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:19.446
So it was becoming a very affluent area.

59
00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:21.866
The major difference was,

60
00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:26.171
that I observed was that

61
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:31.163
children seemed to be just very entitled,

62
00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:34.403
appeared to have this sort of,

63
00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:35.843
this idea of entitlement.

64
00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:38.943
A real lack of sort of understanding or appreciation

65
00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:41.066
for what they had.

66
00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:45.026
Not much gratitude, if any at all,

67
00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:47.530
and I often say, you know, that this was a

68
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.730
partly a result of the confused parenting styles

69
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.410
of our generation.

70
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.150
We kind of threw a lot of the old,

71
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.030
sort of old-fashioned manners out,

72
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.450
and it was one of things that I thought

73
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.630
okay, maybe we just need to start to incorporate

74
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.930
some old-fashioned manners,

75
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.090
but not in the way that children would just

76
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.742
you know, please and thank you in a rote kind of way,

77
00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:12.464
but really understand what they had to be grateful for.

78
00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:13.684
And this was huge,

79
00:03:13.684 --> 00:03:16.404
I mean this was probably the major difference that I saw

80
00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:20.289
in the attitudes of children

81
00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.724
in California, in the States,

82
00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:25.801
that compared with in the monastery.

83
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:26.881
<v Voiceover>And can you talk about</v>

84
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:28.821
the life there in the monastery and the children there

85
00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:30.301
in comparison for a moment.

86
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:33.141
<v ->Yeah, well the children pretty much all came from,</v>

87
00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.321
a number of them were orphans,

88
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.061
Tibetan refugees,

89
00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:41.539
came from very poor families,

90
00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.414
and from dawn until

91
00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:47.539
well into the evening

92
00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:48.841
around 10 or 11 o'clock,

93
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.881
they would be studying,

94
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:54.081
doing chores non-stop.

95
00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:57.481
And yet they were, they were all happy,

96
00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:58.821
they were respectful,

97
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.321
they really seemed to appreciate

98
00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:02.579
actually everything that they have,

99
00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.559
as little as they did have.

100
00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.999
So that was a real,

101
00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.239
I mean right there was a very different

102
00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.999
one, learning environment,

103
00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.519
very different expectations placed on these young children,

104
00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.699
that they could,

105
00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.419
it was okay for them to be up at dawn

106
00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.779
and not go to bed until 10 or 11 o'clock at night,

107
00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:24.739
and be studying, learning, doing chores all day long.

108
00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:29.739
So here, whereas here, in the States,

109
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.371
it was very different,

110
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.171
where children actually were given a lot of power

111
00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:40.371
and not given a lot of training in taking responsibility.

112
00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:43.851
And they couldn't handle the power.

113
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:44.631
And I used to say,

114
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.631
well these children,

115
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:47.291
actually this is not making them happy

116
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.611
because the children usually who are crying and screaming

117
00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:53.411
loud, more loud, you know, the louder they were screaming,

118
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.511
the more they were looking for boundaries, guidance.

119
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:57.231
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

120
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.811
<v ->And it was something that I say going back again</v>

121
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.391
to the confused generation of parents.

122
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:04.551
We were kind of allowing too much freedom,

123
00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:06.551
giving too much power to the children

124
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.531
and not enough training in how to use that.

125
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:11.871
<v Voiceover>So you began a school.</v>

126
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:13.751
You started or founded a school.

127
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:15.051
<v ->Uh hmm.</v>

128
00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:17.331
<v Voiceover>And I assume</v>

129
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:19.491
that you didn't have instant transformation.

130
00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:22.251
It's not as though you had a student body of people

131
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:24.411
who were instantly grateful

132
00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:27.071
and sliding into what you would have felt

133
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:30.303
would be more ideal behavior for human happiness.

134
00:05:30.303 --> 00:05:32.143
Let's talk about that part of the journey,

135
00:05:32.143 --> 00:05:33.283
once the kids came on board,

136
00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:36.563
and how you started inculcating

137
00:05:36.563 --> 00:05:38.845
some of these finer attributes of life

138
00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:40.585
into lives that were as you say

139
00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:41.905
not particularly grateful

140
00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.645
and perhaps self-centered and so forth.

141
00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:49.265
What were some of the first obstacles you noticed?

142
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:53.285
<v ->Well.</v>

143
00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:57.365
First and foremost I would say

144
00:05:57.365 --> 00:06:00.485
that well my first challenge really

145
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.105
was to try to awaken this awareness in them

146
00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:03.925
in the mind of the child

147
00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:05.845
of how fortunate and what they did have

148
00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:06.725
to be grateful for.

149
00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.165
How fortunate they were.

150
00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:09.225
And that's a tough thing

151
00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:10.365
because most of our learning

152
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:13.325
we do through experience, right?

153
00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:14.185
So if I could have taken them

154
00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:16.117
to a third world country, you know,

155
00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:19.037
and they could have experienced what it was like

156
00:06:19.037 --> 00:06:20.817
to really not have anything

157
00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:23.077
and yet appreciate everything about your life,

158
00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:24.957
you know everything that you did have.

159
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:28.977
Then I think that true learning would have taken place

160
00:06:28.977 --> 00:06:30.217
more easily.

161
00:06:30.217 --> 00:06:33.097
But what we did was we

162
00:06:33.097 --> 00:06:37.689
we actually just talked about the interconnectedness

163
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.269
of everything that they had.

164
00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:40.371
You know, the interdependence

165
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:42.329
and that how everything that they had

166
00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:45.249
was dependent upon the labors and the efforts

167
00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:49.569
of so many people and animals.

168
00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:50.159
So this was a...

169
00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.489
<v Voiceover>You started with some simple things, right?</v>

170
00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:52.773
Like snack.

171
00:06:52.773 --> 00:06:53.513
<v ->Snack.</v>

172
00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:54.485
<v Voiceover>Their snacks in the school,</v>

173
00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:55.525
the clothing the were wearing.

174
00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:56.021
<v ->Exactly.</v>

175
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:57.041
<v Voiceover>Talk about how you</v>

176
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:57.941
helped them understand this

177
00:06:57.941 --> 00:06:59.621
and where you started seeing the lights go on

178
00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:00.681
for the first time.

179
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:02.601
<v ->Uh hmm, well it was really actually</v>

180
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.781
that's a pretty quick "aha" moment

181
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:06.581
that you start to see in the minds of a child,

182
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:08.841
when they start to just trace back,

183
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:10.581
you know, "Where did your snack come from?"

184
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.021
"Look, you've got crackers today.

185
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:13.141
"And you've got cheese.

186
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.961
"Where do crackers come from?"

187
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:16.641
"Oh, they come from the store,"

188
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:18.401
or "My mom buys them."

189
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:20.041
"Well, where does your mom get them from?"

190
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:22.041
And you just trace it back to there

191
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:23.821
and they can go back into very complex

192
00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:25.401
you know, thinking of, you know,

193
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:27.561
and the trucks and the truck drivers,

194
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.721
and you can even go into

195
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.041
where do the trucks come from.

196
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:31.781
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

197
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.921
<v ->So it gets very,</v>

198
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:34.621
I mean it's vast and it's never-ending.

199
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.761
And they love that exploration.

200
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:39.101
They really enjoy it

201
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:40.541
and they see it as a challenge

202
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.041
and they love to try to trace it back.

203
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:44.873
So that was pretty quick.

204
00:07:44.873 --> 00:07:46.691
It definitely takes them outside of themselves,

205
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.513
and you know one of the differences in the culture as well,

206
00:07:49.513 --> 00:07:51.973
when I compare the culture in Nepal,

207
00:07:51.973 --> 00:07:53.353
one it's the monastic setting,

208
00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:55.553
the other is just in Asia itself.

209
00:07:55.553 --> 00:07:57.773
You know there seems to be more of

210
00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:01.733
and there's a lot of reasons I think for this,

211
00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:04.013
but there's more the view,

212
00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:06.653
the child grows up in more view of themselves

213
00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:10.133
as being a part of a group.

214
00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:13.477
You know, a part of something larger than just themselves.

215
00:08:13.477 --> 00:08:18.077
So it's more that collectivist sort of, you know, viewpoint.

216
00:08:18.077 --> 00:08:20.237
Whereas, here in the States,

217
00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:22.457
I saw it's more focused on the individual.

218
00:08:22.457 --> 00:08:23.417
So what this does,

219
00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.899
just doing this exercise,

220
00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:26.899
(coughs) excuse me,

221
00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.979
doing this exercise of really tracing back

222
00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:30.359
where everything that they,

223
00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:32.359
well you know, let's start with the snack,

224
00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:33.359
and then go to the clothes

225
00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:34.201
or go to anything that you want to choose.

226
00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.375
<v Voiceover>Shoes.</v>

227
00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:37.435
<v ->The building we're in.</v>

228
00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:39.435
The carpet.

229
00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.015
Anything at all.

230
00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:44.375
Then immediately what starts to arise in the child

231
00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:48.655
is just this more awareness of being part of

232
00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:53.555
a never-ending chain of interconnection

233
00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:57.635
and that their whole lives and their well-being

234
00:08:57.635 --> 00:09:01.435
is dependent upon so many others, as well.

235
00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:03.875
And then we can turn this of course to,

236
00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.115
so what arises from that is an appreciation,

237
00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:07.477
a natural appreciation,

238
00:09:07.477 --> 00:09:11.469
but really understanding why you need to appreciate so much

239
00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:14.309
and or you have so much to appreciate.

240
00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:17.889
And also gratitude, of course.

241
00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:21.509
So that gratitude, and seeing that

242
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:26.429
and that wish actually to reciprocate (coughs)

243
00:09:26.429 --> 00:09:30.529
also arises from this step (coughs).

244
00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:35.269
So, yeah, that's.

245
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:36.729
<v Voiceover>And so from there,</v>

246
00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:38.809
to start creating something

247
00:09:38.809 --> 00:09:41.249
maybe even a little more proactive.

248
00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:44.429
Starting to plant the seeds of the desire

249
00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:48.809
to be say, generous and kind.

250
00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:52.549
How did you spark that in kids?

251
00:09:52.549 --> 00:09:56.329
<v ->So to be generous and kind.</v>

252
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.129
<v Voiceover>If I'm being, feeling entitled</v>

253
00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:00.069
and a little, maybe a little selfish,

254
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:01.649
and you know, my stuff.

255
00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:04.749
<v ->So, it was sort of the natural thing,</v>

256
00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:05.949
okay, "How does it feel?"

257
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:07.569
You can go back to how does it feel, right?

258
00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:09.969
You have to base it on personal experience.

259
00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:11.489
"How does it feel when you,

260
00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:13.029
"when somebody gives something to you?"

261
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.789
Look, so many people have given so much.

262
00:10:15.789 --> 00:10:17.289
Look at your mom, she works to give you,

263
00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:20.959
you can take it on that level.

264
00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:22.241
"How does it make it you feel?"

265
00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:23.861
It feels really good, you know.

266
00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:26.241
"Have you ever given to other people?"

267
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.181
What kind of things?

268
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:28.601
Like when you go to a birthday party,

269
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:30.921
or you say thank you to somebody,

270
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:32.141
how does that feel?

271
00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:33.001
It feels good.

272
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.681
So they start to become aware

273
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:37.121
of that, of what it feels like actually

274
00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:39.801
to be generous and to be one of those givers.

275
00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:41.861
Everything is giving something,

276
00:10:41.861 --> 00:10:42.821
they start to conclude.

277
00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:44.201
Everything is giving something.

278
00:10:44.201 --> 00:10:45.701
So what would you like to give.

279
00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:47.281
Now at this juncture, actually,

280
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.081
I'm going to go back a little bit

281
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.523
and say that that's how I first started sort of randomly,

282
00:10:52.523 --> 00:10:55.415
moving around to hit different things

283
00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:58.075
like generosity, kindness,

284
00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.235
working with our emotions.

285
00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:01.575
And then after some years

286
00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:03.475
of implementing different ideas

287
00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:04.975
and different methodologies,

288
00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:07.295
I actually started to become aware

289
00:11:07.295 --> 00:11:09.097
what we needed was a more integrated

290
00:11:09.097 --> 00:11:11.417
and comprehensive program,

291
00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:14.717
that was actually like a step-by-step program

292
00:11:14.717 --> 00:11:18.297
that would awaken and spark

293
00:11:18.297 --> 00:11:20.137
in the mind of the child

294
00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:22.677
what I believed would really bring them

295
00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:24.497
true happiness and fulfillment.

296
00:11:24.497 --> 00:11:26.597
Because what I had come up with,

297
00:11:26.597 --> 00:11:27.697
am I okay to go with this?

298
00:11:27.697 --> 00:11:28.477
<v Voiceover>Yeah I was going to say</v>

299
00:11:28.477 --> 00:11:30.017
that's not part of the American curriculum.

300
00:11:30.017 --> 00:11:30.717
<v ->No.</v>

301
00:11:30.717 --> 00:11:32.037
<v Voiceover>The pursuit of happiness.</v>

302
00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:33.417
<v ->That's right.</v>

303
00:11:33.417 --> 00:11:34.457
<v Voiceover>And the understanding of</v>

304
00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:36.177
the tenants of and building blocks of happiness

305
00:11:36.177 --> 00:11:37.957
is not part of the western way.

306
00:11:37.957 --> 00:11:38.857
<v ->Correct.</v>

307
00:11:38.857 --> 00:11:41.997
So, and sadly lacking.

308
00:11:41.997 --> 00:11:45.297
And so, I saw that just the way that

309
00:11:45.297 --> 00:11:46.377
and the approach of the sort of

310
00:11:46.377 --> 00:11:48.997
"me first" and focus on the individual

311
00:11:48.997 --> 00:11:51.917
in children growing up feeling very entitled

312
00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:54.281
was actually the result of that,

313
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.181
was not bringing the children happiness,

314
00:11:56.181 --> 00:11:57.561
nor was it bringing the parents

315
00:11:57.561 --> 00:12:00.081
and people around them happiness.

316
00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:02.501
So I really saw this as my number one

317
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:06.693
sort of major project here,

318
00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:11.693
is how do I awaken or start to develop

319
00:12:12.093 --> 00:12:15.333
help to develop these qualities in these children,

320
00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.633
this awareness of how they can have the power

321
00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:20.673
to transform their own lives

322
00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:22.513
and become happier people

323
00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:25.213
and how they can impact those around them

324
00:12:25.213 --> 00:12:26.993
in a way that brings more happiness to others

325
00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.673
and thus to themselves as well.

326
00:12:28.673 --> 00:12:31.793
So it's this interconnected way of looking at things.

327
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:35.013
But how to do that was not tell them

328
00:12:35.013 --> 00:12:36.053
what they need to do,

329
00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:39.493
but rather awaken that in their minds.

330
00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.913
Because I believe that every child and every being

331
00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:45.453
has that, those good qualities within their mind.

332
00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:48.193
It's sort of like the nature of the mind and the self.

333
00:12:48.193 --> 00:12:50.015
But, you know, it has to be awakened.

334
00:12:50.015 --> 00:12:50.895
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

335
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.875
<v ->And unless, and we need to as parents</v>

336
00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:56.815
and educators need to take responsibility

337
00:12:56.815 --> 00:12:58.135
to be the guide in that way.

338
00:12:58.135 --> 00:12:59.435
And I think this was one of the things

339
00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:00.535
that I saw when I say

340
00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:02.415
"confused generation of parents"

341
00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:06.035
is that we gave a lot of power to our children

342
00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.635
so we were kind of reverting,

343
00:13:07.635 --> 00:13:09.555
we threw out the way of where we were

344
00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.595
the authoritarian figure

345
00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:12.995
and telling our children, you know,

346
00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:15.155
"We need to do this and you need to do that."

347
00:13:15.155 --> 00:13:16.735
And in an oppressive way.

348
00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:20.015
But we actually didn't replace it with anything

349
00:13:20.015 --> 00:13:20.795
for awhile.

350
00:13:20.795 --> 00:13:22.335
Now we're starting to get that together.

351
00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:25.715
Now we're starting to find a middle way.

352
00:13:25.715 --> 00:13:27.557
<v Voiceover>So you know this task ahead of you,</v>

353
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:28.537
I mean, you had to figure,

354
00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:29.637
you had to create a system.

355
00:13:29.637 --> 00:13:30.437
<v ->Figure it out.</v>

356
00:13:30.437 --> 00:13:32.637
And so I had to create a system, exactly.

357
00:13:32.637 --> 00:13:33.677
So I knew what I wanted.

358
00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:36.477
First and foremost I knew that what I wanted

359
00:13:36.477 --> 00:13:41.129
in essence was to create and provide

360
00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:43.229
the best possible foundation.

361
00:13:43.229 --> 00:13:45.769
Because those young years are the foundational years

362
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:47.629
for the rest of their lives.

363
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:48.869
They're so important.

364
00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:51.209
That's when all that brain development's happening.

365
00:13:51.209 --> 00:13:53.569
Children learn more in the first five years of their life

366
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:55.609
than any other time in their lives.

367
00:13:55.609 --> 00:13:58.089
So it was really,

368
00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:00.209
it's a very critical and precious time.

369
00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:02.289
This is, these are the foundational years.

370
00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:07.289
Children, primarily what determines the child's,

371
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:10.369
or gives the greatest, has the greatest influence

372
00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:12.309
on the development of the child,

373
00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:14.829
is first and foremost the parents and the family,

374
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:16.109
the home environment.

375
00:14:16.109 --> 00:14:17.029
But in this culture,

376
00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:18.969
that home environment and the family

377
00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:20.189
was breaking apart.

378
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:24.929
It was, and that's a big topic right there.

379
00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:28.829
But I could see that a lot of what I was experiencing

380
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:30.729
and observing, these differences,

381
00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:33.169
was greatly due to that as well.

382
00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:35.609
The breakdown of the home, the family unit.

383
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:37.749
<v Voiceover>Cause consistency went out the door with that.</v>

384
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:39.329
Right, I mean and that's a big one,

385
00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:41.169
consistency where even in the orphanages...

386
00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:42.129
<v ->Family values.</v>

387
00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:43.869
<v Voiceover>Yes, and the orphanages you were working in,</v>

388
00:14:43.869 --> 00:14:44.929
the monastery and such,

389
00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:47.049
at least there were consistent values.

390
00:14:47.049 --> 00:14:48.429
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

391
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:52.231
Consistent values, framework, structure, discipline.

392
00:14:52.231 --> 00:14:54.471
And I think what came out

393
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:57.931
what we have in this culture, very much so,

394
00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:02.191
is the disintegration a lot of the time

395
00:15:02.191 --> 00:15:05.391
of the family unit.

396
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:08.351
No clear family values.

397
00:15:08.351 --> 00:15:09.351
Values that change,

398
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:13.071
depending on who's living in the home at the time,

399
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:15.011
who's doing the parenting,

400
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:16.511
blended families.

401
00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:18.631
A lot of these issues that you know

402
00:15:18.631 --> 00:15:21.071
weren't so much issues

403
00:15:21.071 --> 00:15:23.291
or you don't see so many of those issues

404
00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:26.031
in other cultures, Asian cultures.

405
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:28.231
More the extended family,

406
00:15:28.231 --> 00:15:31.151
so there's that respect and appreciation for the elders.

407
00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:32.651
Not what you see here.

408
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:34.791
So there's a lot of things

409
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:36.491
that actually have contributed to

410
00:15:36.491 --> 00:15:38.871
issues and problems that we're now facing.

411
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.331
<v Voiceover>But you actually started by</v>

412
00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:41.791
respecting them as well,

413
00:15:41.791 --> 00:15:43.091
respecting the students,

414
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:45.271
in that you as I was listening to you

415
00:15:45.271 --> 00:15:46.731
you were talking about how at one point

416
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:48.171
and I don't know if this was the beginning

417
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:50.111
of the seven steps of the program,

418
00:15:50.111 --> 00:15:51.931
but asking them,

419
00:15:51.931 --> 00:15:53.631
"What do you want?"

420
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:54.471
<v ->Uh hmm.</v>

421
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:55.771
<v Voiceover>From this experience here at school.</v>

422
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:57.171
<v ->Right.</v>

423
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:59.751
So creating that comprehensive program I talked about,

424
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:02.311
because over the years starting in different places,

425
00:16:02.311 --> 00:16:05.631
I started to observe that actually there was

426
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.551
foundational steps that were important

427
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.211
in order to start to change the child's,

428
00:16:12.211 --> 00:16:15.791
or for the child's thinking to start to transform

429
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:19.731
into this more sort of expanded view of themselves

430
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.691
as a part of something much greater.

431
00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:24.231
And to actually find in themselves

432
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:25.891
and understand logically

433
00:16:25.891 --> 00:16:28.951
why they needed to be take responsibility

434
00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:29.725
for their own happiness.

435
00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:30.683
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

436
00:16:30.683 --> 00:16:32.745
<v ->And for the happiness of others around them.</v>

437
00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:37.385
So, this, I put together actually

438
00:16:37.385 --> 00:16:42.385
I mean through this whole sort of experimental phase

439
00:16:42.485 --> 00:16:45.485
and it was really my own personal research,

440
00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:47.585
what I call the seven steps now.

441
00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:50.205
And where I started is I realized that you have to start

442
00:16:50.205 --> 00:16:52.365
where the child is at.

443
00:16:52.365 --> 00:16:55.205
And actually it's the same place where most

444
00:16:55.205 --> 00:16:56.645
beings are at.

445
00:16:56.645 --> 00:17:00.465
And we have this instinctual sort of drive

446
00:17:00.465 --> 00:17:04.025
to satisfy oneself,

447
00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:06.585
for ourselves really deep inside

448
00:17:06.585 --> 00:17:09.662
to feel good, to be happy.

449
00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:12.422
So, uhm.

450
00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:14.002
So that was my step one.

451
00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:16.062
I would ask the children,

452
00:17:16.062 --> 00:17:17.002
"What do you want?

453
00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.782
"What do you really want?"

454
00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:20.022
And when they would come to school

455
00:17:20.022 --> 00:17:21.282
and we still do this

456
00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:22.762
at the beginning of the school year,

457
00:17:22.762 --> 00:17:24.002
"What kind of a classroom

458
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:26.182
"do you want to come to each day?"

459
00:17:26.182 --> 00:17:29.042
And so they generate their own idea around that,

460
00:17:29.042 --> 00:17:32.282
actually they have lots of ideas around that.

461
00:17:32.282 --> 00:17:34.222
And I ask them to choose their,

462
00:17:34.222 --> 00:17:36.542
the thing that they most would like to have,

463
00:17:36.542 --> 00:17:37.602
you know, at school.

464
00:17:37.602 --> 00:17:38.782
And so they come up with things

465
00:17:38.782 --> 00:17:41.642
like sharing and friends and kindness

466
00:17:41.642 --> 00:17:44.542
and speaking kindly to each other, you know.

467
00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:47.182
Yes, you can be my friend.

468
00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:48.182
Those kinds of things.

469
00:17:48.182 --> 00:17:50.122
And they create a collage,

470
00:17:50.122 --> 00:17:51.282
they write about it.

471
00:17:51.282 --> 00:17:53.122
They write the word that they really want

472
00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:54.742
and create a collage

473
00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:56.442
or sometimes, you know, it might take a different form

474
00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:59.922
where, you know, around little mirror frames or,

475
00:17:59.922 --> 00:18:01.422
you can get creative with that.

476
00:18:01.422 --> 00:18:02.742
But when they're all placed together,

477
00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:03.642
we put them all together

478
00:18:03.642 --> 00:18:04.902
and it forms like a patchwork

479
00:18:04.902 --> 00:18:08.442
and that becomes representative of the classroom.

480
00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:11.582
And we keep referring back to that

481
00:18:11.582 --> 00:18:14.762
everyday, all year long.

482
00:18:14.762 --> 00:18:15.522
"How're we going?

483
00:18:15.522 --> 00:18:16.462
"Is this what we wanted?

484
00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:17.722
"Is this what we said we wanted?"

485
00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:18.742
<v Voiceover>Becomes the touchstone.</v>

486
00:18:18.742 --> 00:18:20.602
<v ->Becomes the touchstone, yeah.</v>

487
00:18:20.602 --> 00:18:21.482
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

488
00:18:21.482 --> 00:18:23.702
<v ->So, and it's tangible.</v>

489
00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:24.743
They can see it.

490
00:18:24.743 --> 00:18:25.722
They generated it.

491
00:18:25.722 --> 00:18:26.482
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

492
00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:27.902
<v ->So it becomes actually</v>

493
00:18:27.902 --> 00:18:31.082
their own set of golden rules, if you like.

494
00:18:31.082 --> 00:18:32.782
And their goals.

495
00:18:32.782 --> 00:18:35.962
And their aspiration.

496
00:18:35.962 --> 00:18:37.482
So we talk about this as sort of being

497
00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.582
'Wow, imagine if we came to school

498
00:18:39.582 --> 00:18:42.502
"everyday and it was filled with all these good things.

499
00:18:42.502 --> 00:18:45.482
"So, let's see if we can make that magic happen."

500
00:18:45.482 --> 00:18:46.222
And after awhile,

501
00:18:46.222 --> 00:18:48.242
maybe after a week of checking it out,

502
00:18:48.242 --> 00:18:50.302
we'll say, "Well how are you doing?

503
00:18:50.302 --> 00:18:51.942
"Do we have this environment?"

504
00:18:51.942 --> 00:18:55.362
"Well, sometimes, but we all wished for it

505
00:18:55.362 --> 00:18:56.962
"then what gets in the way."

506
00:18:56.962 --> 00:18:59.162
Is it enough just to have the wish.

507
00:18:59.162 --> 00:19:00.602
Or do we actually have to do something

508
00:19:00.602 --> 00:19:01.582
to make it happen.

509
00:19:01.582 --> 00:19:02.602
<v Voiceover>Is that step two, then?</v>

510
00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:05.302
<v ->We're getting to step two, yeah.</v>

511
00:19:05.302 --> 00:19:10.302
So, they come up with through analyzing it,

512
00:19:10.802 --> 00:19:12.222
they say "Okay, yeah we will,

513
00:19:12.222 --> 00:19:13.362
"I guess we have to do something."

514
00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:14.482
And I say, "Or do you wait

515
00:19:14.482 --> 00:19:15.982
"for somebody else to do it?

516
00:19:15.982 --> 00:19:17.782
"Do you look to see if other people are doing it?

517
00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.942
"Or do you act first?"

518
00:19:19.942 --> 00:19:24.042
And they say, "Well, I guess we should do it, first."

519
00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:25.782
So they figure it all out.

520
00:19:25.782 --> 00:19:27.582
So this brings us to step two.

521
00:19:27.582 --> 00:19:28.682
And step two is

522
00:19:28.682 --> 00:19:33.602
okay, so we actually have to take action.

523
00:19:33.602 --> 00:19:35.342
Can you think of anything

524
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:39.482
that arises or comes from, all by itself?

525
00:19:39.482 --> 00:19:41.822
That doesn't come from something else?

526
00:19:41.822 --> 00:19:45.022
And so they start to examine that.

527
00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:48.090
And that's when we can spend a lot of time

528
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.762
in that step two.

529
00:19:49.762 --> 00:19:52.042
Because it's so vast, actually.

530
00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:52.822
It never ends.

531
00:19:52.822 --> 00:19:53.982
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

532
00:19:53.982 --> 00:19:55.842
<v ->And so you explore it,</v>

533
00:19:55.842 --> 00:19:58.702
I mean and all these steps by the way

534
00:19:58.702 --> 00:20:01.122
are integrated throughout our curriculum

535
00:20:01.122 --> 00:20:04.162
so you'll find you know, we'll start the week off

536
00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:07.022
with a focus on one of the particular steps

537
00:20:07.022 --> 00:20:10.282
or mini-steps in between each of those major steps.

538
00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:13.622
And (coughs)

539
00:20:13.622 --> 00:20:17.602
and the whole,

540
00:20:17.602 --> 00:20:18.602
all the curriculum

541
00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:21.462
is going to be focused on that step

542
00:20:21.462 --> 00:20:22.342
that we're at.

543
00:20:22.342 --> 00:20:24.322
So it becomes really holistic,

544
00:20:24.322 --> 00:20:27.302
a very holistic, integrated way to learn

545
00:20:27.302 --> 00:20:30.962
social studies, science, language arts,

546
00:20:30.962 --> 00:20:34.722
art projects, movement.

547
00:20:34.722 --> 00:20:37.602
And it's very easy to do, actually,

548
00:20:37.602 --> 00:20:39.662
according to all the standards as well,

549
00:20:39.662 --> 00:20:41.122
the state standards.

550
00:20:41.122 --> 00:20:43.482
So it's very adaptable.

551
00:20:43.482 --> 00:20:44.002
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

552
00:20:44.002 --> 00:20:45.642
<v ->Because I often say, you know,</v>

553
00:20:45.642 --> 00:20:48.462
these steps are not something that

554
00:20:48.462 --> 00:20:51.962
you're putting on top of anything.

555
00:20:51.962 --> 00:20:54.702
It's actually just awakening your understanding

556
00:20:54.702 --> 00:20:56.642
of the way things exist.

557
00:20:56.642 --> 00:20:57.782
And understanding things

558
00:20:57.782 --> 00:21:00.162
on a little bit deeper level.

559
00:21:00.162 --> 00:21:01.542
Sometimes the questions we ask

560
00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:03.502
might sound a little bit you know,

561
00:21:03.502 --> 00:21:05.905
maybe profound or too sophisticated.

562
00:21:05.905 --> 00:21:06.945
But on the other hand

563
00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:08.645
actually they're very simple for the children,

564
00:21:08.645 --> 00:21:09.907
it's just we don't ask the question.

565
00:21:09.907 --> 00:21:10.667
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

566
00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:11.987
<v ->If you ask the question,</v>

567
00:21:11.987 --> 00:21:13.567
children come up with the answer.

568
00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:14.767
And they are quite capable

569
00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:16.667
of exploring those questions

570
00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:20.387
in a very logical, you know, scientific way.

571
00:21:20.387 --> 00:21:22.347
So we use this step seven of course

572
00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.547
to explore not only where everything comes from,

573
00:21:24.547 --> 00:21:26.767
you know like our material things,

574
00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:31.407
and, but also

575
00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:33.907
our happy classroom, you know,

576
00:21:33.907 --> 00:21:35.187
and where does that come in.

577
00:21:35.187 --> 00:21:36.027
What kind of behavior,

578
00:21:36.027 --> 00:21:38.627
what kind of actions,

579
00:21:38.627 --> 00:21:41.127
what does kindness look like?

580
00:21:41.127 --> 00:21:42.347
You know, what does it feel like?

581
00:21:42.347 --> 00:21:44.647
What does it sound like?

582
00:21:44.647 --> 00:21:46.187
And so they can articulate that.

583
00:21:46.187 --> 00:21:47.647
They learn to articulate it

584
00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:49.447
and recognize what kind of actions

585
00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:52.307
actually give them the result they really want.

586
00:21:52.307 --> 00:21:56.027
(coughs) Excuse me.

587
00:21:56.027 --> 00:21:57.467
<v Voiceover>No problem.</v>

588
00:21:57.467 --> 00:22:01.067
Do you hear feedback from the parents?

589
00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:02.227
At what point do you start...

590
00:22:02.227 --> 00:22:02.809
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

591
00:22:02.809 --> 00:22:03.749
<v Voiceover>.. hearing them say</v>

592
00:22:03.749 --> 00:22:05.649
"What are you doing in this classroom?

593
00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:07.189
"Because my little child

594
00:22:07.189 --> 00:22:08.709
"has really lit up.

595
00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:10.329
"She's wanting to be helpful."

596
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.689
<v ->Right away, right away, we do.</v>

597
00:22:12.689 --> 00:22:13.849
And actually at the,

598
00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:15.009
when we start here

599
00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:16.809
as far as, you know, making the magic happen,

600
00:22:16.809 --> 00:22:19.729
we usually ground it in a,

601
00:22:19.729 --> 00:22:21.599
in an ongoing sort of

602
00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:25.064
ah, uhm,

603
00:22:25.064 --> 00:22:28.349
activity that is symbolic

604
00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:31.396
of what we're creating.

605
00:22:31.396 --> 00:22:32.996
So for instance,

606
00:22:32.996 --> 00:22:33.756
and it's usually based,

607
00:22:33.756 --> 00:22:37.436
somehow centered and integrated into our theme.

608
00:22:37.436 --> 00:22:39.668
So for instance,

609
00:22:39.668 --> 00:22:42.108
we were doing, we've been developing

610
00:22:42.108 --> 00:22:44.168
this curriculum around the elements,

611
00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:46.068
and we talk about the precious elements.

612
00:22:46.068 --> 00:22:47.548
And of course all these steps can go through

613
00:22:47.548 --> 00:22:48.708
all the elements.

614
00:22:48.708 --> 00:22:50.288
And we work with one element at a time.

615
00:22:50.288 --> 00:22:51.868
And they fit in with the season.

616
00:22:51.868 --> 00:22:54.688
So we'll start with the fire element

617
00:22:54.688 --> 00:22:56.368
in the beginning of the school year.

618
00:22:56.368 --> 00:22:57.768
It's going to be the end of summer.

619
00:22:57.768 --> 00:22:59.388
It's still summer.

620
00:22:59.388 --> 00:23:02.348
And then on into the Indian summer (coughs)

621
00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:05.928
and so we explore the fire, the heat,

622
00:23:05.928 --> 00:23:07.948
the element of fire

623
00:23:07.948 --> 00:23:09.768
both internally and externally

624
00:23:09.768 --> 00:23:11.408
and the interconnection between the two.

625
00:23:11.408 --> 00:23:12.288
<v Voiceover>Um. Interesting.</v>

626
00:23:12.288 --> 00:23:14.910
<v ->So then we also have, you know,</v>

627
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.810
it's all tied in of course with emotions as well.

628
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:22.270
So we started a project

629
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.150
there where we had

630
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.630
we had like a plate,

631
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.190
bamboo plate actually.

632
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.450
Put a mirror in the center.

633
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.450
They put a mirror in the center

634
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.770
and that represents or symbolizes their mind

635
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.550
and what is created from their mind

636
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.870
and then the whole thing is going,

637
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.130
it symbolizes heat or the sun.

638
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.330
So we are like the sun.

639
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.670
So we draw that sort of metaphor analogy

640
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.970
and how are we like the sun.

641
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.450
Well we generate heat.

642
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.154
And we actually generate sort of light.

643
00:23:50.154 --> 00:23:51.994
And we can generate you know,

644
00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:54.754
these different, these different kinds of lights,

645
00:23:54.754 --> 00:23:59.754
like we integrate color as a form of

646
00:24:00.768 --> 00:24:03.848
recognizing helpful emotions,

647
00:24:03.848 --> 00:24:05.488
and working with our emotions.

648
00:24:05.488 --> 00:24:08.468
So red is generosity, for instance.

649
00:24:08.468 --> 00:24:10.448
So at the end of the day,

650
00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:13.148
in the circle at the end,

651
00:24:13.148 --> 00:24:15.948
because very important is our rhythm through the day

652
00:24:15.948 --> 00:24:17.228
and our daily rituals,

653
00:24:17.228 --> 00:24:18.888
and I'll talk about that as far as

654
00:24:18.888 --> 00:24:21.848
sort of really creating a very nice framework

655
00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:24.308
and guide for the children.

656
00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:26.008
And at the end of the day

657
00:24:26.008 --> 00:24:28.268
we always have a dedication,

658
00:24:28.268 --> 00:24:29.628
and look at the day

659
00:24:29.628 --> 00:24:30.708
and how have we done,

660
00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:32.551
and how did we go at sort of

661
00:24:32.551 --> 00:24:35.111
creating the kind of climate

662
00:24:35.111 --> 00:24:36.671
that we wanted in our classroom,

663
00:24:36.671 --> 00:24:38.571
so this is fitting in with those elements.

664
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:39.851
Create the kind of climate.

665
00:24:39.851 --> 00:24:40.871
Do we like it too hot?

666
00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:43.291
No, no, we don't like it too hot.

667
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:45.591
It makes us anxious and upset,

668
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:46.451
frustrated,

669
00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.351
and we sometimes explode, you know,

670
00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:50.091
like a volcano.

671
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:51.711
Do we like it too cold?

672
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:53.731
We talk about cold-hearted, warm-hearted.

673
00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:55.951
So there's, it's, really you can get very creative

674
00:24:55.951 --> 00:24:58.591
you can really make a nice integrated program.

675
00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:01.211
We always teach in themes,

676
00:25:01.211 --> 00:25:02.691
because themes,

677
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:03.531
if you don't teach in themes

678
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:05.331
then learning becomes very fragmented

679
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:06.931
and that's not actually the way things exist.

680
00:25:06.931 --> 00:25:07.691
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

681
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:09.991
<v ->So we teach in themes.</v>

682
00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:11.771
So then at the end of the day,

683
00:25:11.771 --> 00:25:15.991
we, the children in this step two,

684
00:25:15.991 --> 00:25:17.891
become kindness detectives.

685
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:22.008
And they really try to take note of and notice

686
00:25:22.008 --> 00:25:24.268
you know, either their friends,

687
00:25:24.268 --> 00:25:26.368
who are doing things that are actually helping

688
00:25:26.368 --> 00:25:29.198
to create the kind of climate

689
00:25:29.198 --> 00:25:32.078
that we want in our classroom.

690
00:25:32.078 --> 00:25:33.908
And they acknowledge each other

691
00:25:33.908 --> 00:25:35.588
at the end of the day.

692
00:25:35.588 --> 00:25:40.026
And then according to the acknowledgements

693
00:25:40.026 --> 00:25:45.026
then they, the children are awarded

694
00:25:46.248 --> 00:25:48.088
colored tiles.

695
00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:50.015
And the colored tiles are made from glass,

696
00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:51.635
because we've studied glass already

697
00:25:51.635 --> 00:25:53.195
in this fire element

698
00:25:53.195 --> 00:25:54.495
where we're exploring fire,

699
00:25:54.495 --> 00:25:56.775
and where does glass come from.

700
00:25:56.775 --> 00:25:59.095
And glass comes from extreme heat,

701
00:25:59.095 --> 00:26:00.795
and sand, you know.

702
00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:02.835
And they, we went to a glass factory

703
00:26:02.835 --> 00:26:05.155
and saw how it was being made, etc., etc.

704
00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:06.755
and so it becomes more experiential.

705
00:26:06.755 --> 00:26:07.735
And so anyway,

706
00:26:07.735 --> 00:26:08.775
then they earn these tiles

707
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:10.155
and they're starting to create

708
00:26:10.155 --> 00:26:11.575
this beautiful sun

709
00:26:11.575 --> 00:26:12.995
that they'll take home

710
00:26:12.995 --> 00:26:16.135
at the end of that study,

711
00:26:16.135 --> 00:26:17.575
So the thematic study.

712
00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:19.375
So that's something that's very

713
00:26:19.375 --> 00:26:22.475
it's sort of reinforcing the positive,

714
00:26:22.475 --> 00:26:25.555
acknowledging, rejoicing at their friends.

715
00:26:25.555 --> 00:26:26.575
<v Voiceover>And making very material.</v>

716
00:26:26.575 --> 00:26:28.715
<v ->And making it very material.</v>

717
00:26:28.715 --> 00:26:29.635
And they see it.

718
00:26:29.635 --> 00:26:30.915
So these are the kind of things

719
00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:32.715
that their parents

720
00:26:32.715 --> 00:26:34.795
that definitely goes home to the parents.

721
00:26:34.795 --> 00:26:36.835
They, parents, know about this

722
00:26:36.835 --> 00:26:39.755
and hear about it, a lot about it,

723
00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:42.335
and you'll hear,

724
00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:44.635
they hear their children saying things about

725
00:26:44.635 --> 00:26:45.455
their little brother.

726
00:26:45.455 --> 00:26:47.295
"Oh he was so patient.

727
00:26:47.295 --> 00:26:49.215
"I think we need to give him a white tile."

728
00:26:49.215 --> 00:26:51.375
(laughs)

729
00:26:51.375 --> 00:26:53.655
Yeah, so just really recognizing the positive.

730
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.915
and it's important for them to really see

731
00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:57.375
the positive in the other children.

732
00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:59.735
And also to know that people,

733
00:26:59.735 --> 00:27:02.335
the other children really see the positive actions

734
00:27:02.335 --> 00:27:03.755
that they do as well.

735
00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.475
Everybody gets acknowledged.

736
00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:07.735
But there's less of a focus,

737
00:27:07.735 --> 00:27:09.095
of course, again on oneself.

738
00:27:09.095 --> 00:27:09.975
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

739
00:27:09.975 --> 00:27:10.815
<v ->And more on the other.</v>

740
00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:12.095
<v Voiceover>And where does it go through there?</v>

741
00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:14.335
Does it become more sophisticated,

742
00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:16.898
as you go through the steps?

743
00:27:16.898 --> 00:27:18.718
And where does it ultimately end up?

744
00:27:18.718 --> 00:27:20.738
<v ->Yeah, well, sophisticated.</v>

745
00:27:20.738 --> 00:27:22.338
As the children get older

746
00:27:22.338 --> 00:27:23.678
and understand these things,

747
00:27:23.678 --> 00:27:28.178
it just becomes sort of a way of looking at the world.

748
00:27:28.178 --> 00:27:30.498
It starts to transform their way

749
00:27:30.498 --> 00:27:32.998
of viewing themselves in the world.

750
00:27:32.998 --> 00:27:35.938
And they start to see that okay,

751
00:27:35.938 --> 00:27:40.030
for instance, with actions that they do,

752
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.930
they start to see that,

753
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.690
you know, if they do something harmful

754
00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.570
or something mean, you know,

755
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.750
then it doesn't bring the result that they want.

756
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.430
<v Voiceover>Does it become some</v>

757
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:49.930
self-regulating there?

758
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.330
<v ->Self-regulating, exactly.</v>

759
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.210
Which is one of the primary things

760
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.810
we hope that they gain from this.

761
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.570
And definitely we do see a big change.

762
00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.910
The next step,

763
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.430
if I probably should go through the steps first,

764
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.590
and we can talk, you know.

765
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.110
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

766
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.310
<v ->Cause I could go, as you've noticed,</v>

767
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.570
I could go on a very long time

768
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.490
and then segueway into different things

769
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.162
so I'll try to stay on the steps.

770
00:28:11.162 --> 00:28:12.310
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

771
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:17.310
<v ->This, what naturally I saw arising from</v>

772
00:28:18.202 --> 00:28:20.622
children understanding the interconnection as well

773
00:28:20.622 --> 00:28:23.322
was to understand that the natural way that

774
00:28:23.322 --> 00:28:25.302
things existed in this very complex,

775
00:28:25.302 --> 00:28:28.602
interconnected universe that we live in,

776
00:28:28.602 --> 00:28:32.802
was, that everything is constantly changing.

777
00:28:32.802 --> 00:28:37.062
That, you know, it's just when you follow

778
00:28:37.062 --> 00:28:40.492
step-by-step the chain, the interconnected chain,

779
00:28:40.492 --> 00:28:42.469
of what brought our snack to our table,

780
00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:45.049
that's just naturally showing change.

781
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:47.069
There's absolutely nothing,

782
00:28:47.069 --> 00:28:48.109
so that nothing

783
00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:52.239
that is static, that does not change.

784
00:28:52.239 --> 00:28:54.509
But I ask the children that.

785
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:55.609
"Can you think of something

786
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:58.151
"that never changes?"

787
00:28:58.151 --> 00:28:59.871
And of course, they can't.

788
00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.971
So they start to realize and become more aware that

789
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:07.447
that the world around them's constantly changing.

790
00:29:07.447 --> 00:29:09.287
That they themselves are constantly changing.

791
00:29:09.287 --> 00:29:13.687
Their emotions are constantly changing.

792
00:29:13.687 --> 00:29:17.287
And then we can tie in that you know,

793
00:29:17.287 --> 00:29:19.587
well what causes,

794
00:29:19.587 --> 00:29:22.387
where do your emotions come from, right?

795
00:29:22.387 --> 00:29:25.127
And as everything comes from something

796
00:29:25.127 --> 00:29:27.167
do emotions come from something?

797
00:29:27.167 --> 00:29:28.827
And they will say,

798
00:29:28.827 --> 00:29:29.967
"Well it comes from a thought,

799
00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:32.207
"from thinking things."

800
00:29:32.207 --> 00:29:33.567
First of all, though,

801
00:29:33.567 --> 00:29:34.969
they'll think it comes from somebody else.

802
00:29:34.969 --> 00:29:36.309
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

803
00:29:36.309 --> 00:29:37.569
<v ->So it comes from actions that</v>

804
00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:40.821
that often, you know that other children will do,

805
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:42.061
or it comes from frustration

806
00:29:42.061 --> 00:29:44.101
at not being able to do what they want.

807
00:29:44.101 --> 00:29:45.461
But then they can trace it back.

808
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:48.301
Yeah, but then you can examine that too.

809
00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:49.561
And you say, okay.

810
00:29:49.561 --> 00:29:53.501
So anyway, I'll get to that

811
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:55.961
when we get to a later step.

812
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.741
But so they can examine this and see

813
00:29:58.741 --> 00:30:02.621
that actually the way that they're thinking, you know,

814
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:04.801
and their thoughts are constantly changing,

815
00:30:04.801 --> 00:30:07.141
are also affecting their moods

816
00:30:07.141 --> 00:30:08.901
and their emotions.

817
00:30:08.901 --> 00:30:11.861
So the next step that naturally arises out of that

818
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:14.481
is the relativity of perspective.

819
00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:17.521
Which is your mind creates your reality.

820
00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:19.801
And we all have our own minds.

821
00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:21.321
And so do we all see everything,

822
00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:25.021
do we all see things the same way?

823
00:30:25.021 --> 00:30:27.511
And so we have some great activities there,

824
00:30:27.511 --> 00:30:28.701
some optical illusions,

825
00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:31.541
and some gestalt pictures

826
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:35.706
and various activities that we can do at that time, too,

827
00:30:35.706 --> 00:30:37.346
to illustrate this.

828
00:30:37.346 --> 00:30:40.546
Role play, scenarios.

829
00:30:40.546 --> 00:30:42.366
Likes and dislikes.

830
00:30:42.366 --> 00:30:43.666
Very basic things.

831
00:30:43.666 --> 00:30:44.446
And they start to say,

832
00:30:44.446 --> 00:30:46.246
"Of course, no, we don't all see the same.

833
00:30:46.246 --> 00:30:48.006
"We don't all like the same things.

834
00:30:48.006 --> 00:30:50.706
"We don't all see the same things the same way,

835
00:30:50.706 --> 00:30:55.186
"and we don't all enjoy doing the same things."

836
00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:57.268
<v Voiceover>Does that lead to obviously,</v>

837
00:30:57.268 --> 00:30:59.208
a certain amount of acceptance and tolerance

838
00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:00.708
for one another?

839
00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:03.968
<v ->Absolutely, and this is a very critical point</v>

840
00:31:03.968 --> 00:31:07.388
before we can get to the next step.

841
00:31:07.388 --> 00:31:09.370
So from change,

842
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.710
as we've seen going back to the step before that,

843
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.690
they see that, they learn flexibility right there.

844
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.670
They're holding things less concrete.

845
00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.630
They see things more,

846
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.050
you know, everything becomes a little bit more fluid.

847
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:26.070
Even, you know, applying this to our moods.

848
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.470
It will change.

849
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.430
And knowing that it will change.

850
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.670
<v Voiceover>I would think that would make life</v>

851
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.510
not so frightening.

852
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.930
<v ->Not so frightening, not so frightening.</v>

853
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.050
Although there's the other side of change

854
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.790
that can make you feel a little insecure sometimes.

855
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.862
And of course for adults, ultimately,

856
00:31:40.862 --> 00:31:43.622
it's the change of death or loss of.

857
00:31:43.622 --> 00:31:46.022
So actually a lot of our harmful emotions

858
00:31:46.022 --> 00:31:50.602
are rooted in fear and fear of change, too.

859
00:31:50.602 --> 00:31:52.202
So it's important for children

860
00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:53.202
actually to have the courage

861
00:31:53.202 --> 00:31:54.102
to look at change,

862
00:31:54.102 --> 00:31:57.932
to understand it in a very practical and logical way.

863
00:31:57.932 --> 00:32:02.702
But also it allows for, in that way it allows for

864
00:32:02.702 --> 00:32:06.882
resiliency, for courage and resiliency.

865
00:32:06.882 --> 00:32:09.762
And then into this next, into the step four of

866
00:32:09.762 --> 00:32:11.702
your mind creates your reality,

867
00:32:11.702 --> 00:32:15.502
in that same way seeing

868
00:32:15.502 --> 00:32:18.386
that our views and our emotions change

869
00:32:18.386 --> 00:32:21.691
and our views, our likes and dislikes also change.

870
00:32:21.691 --> 00:32:22.771
That maybe, you know,

871
00:32:22.771 --> 00:32:25.931
somebody who we really enjoyed playing with in the morning,

872
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:27.631
says something we don't like,

873
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:28.611
and so in the afternoon

874
00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:30.471
we don't want to have anything to do with them.

875
00:32:30.471 --> 00:32:33.211
So that's just a very obvious example

876
00:32:33.211 --> 00:32:38.211
of how our perception is influenced by our moods.

877
00:32:38.931 --> 00:32:41.011
But now they can see that, too,

878
00:32:41.011 --> 00:32:44.871
that the way that we see things

879
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:47.211
because the way that we see things in our view

880
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:49.331
changes and shifts,

881
00:32:49.331 --> 00:32:50.991
even in a matter of moments,

882
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:55.131
and it's constantly changing actually.

883
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:59.851
So, too, can we embrace and understand, you know,

884
00:32:59.851 --> 00:33:01.131
another person's view

885
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:02.943
that another person may be seeing something,

886
00:33:02.943 --> 00:33:04.723
and we know actually that they are,

887
00:33:04.723 --> 00:33:07.643
in some way they're seeing what we're seeing

888
00:33:07.643 --> 00:33:09.363
in a slightly different way,

889
00:33:09.363 --> 00:33:11.083
according to their filters.

890
00:33:11.083 --> 00:33:13.083
And they start to understand that.

891
00:33:13.083 --> 00:33:13.763
We talk about,

892
00:33:13.763 --> 00:33:15.703
"Why do you think that is, you know,

893
00:33:15.703 --> 00:33:17.383
"that we all see things differently?"

894
00:33:17.383 --> 00:33:21.883
And they trace it back to

895
00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:23.123
like memory.

896
00:33:23.123 --> 00:33:24.903
That they've had an experience, a scenario,

897
00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:26.923
you know, you're playing with a friend.

898
00:33:26.923 --> 00:33:29.943
And another friend comes in, arrives,

899
00:33:29.943 --> 00:33:31.563
and wants to play, you know.

900
00:33:31.563 --> 00:33:32.583
How do you feel about it?

901
00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:33.963
And one child might say,

902
00:33:33.963 --> 00:33:35.783
"I don't like it and I want to go home."

903
00:33:35.783 --> 00:33:36.683
And the other child might say,

904
00:33:36.683 --> 00:33:37.543
"Yeah it's great.

905
00:33:37.543 --> 00:33:39.203
"I've got two friends to play with now."

906
00:33:39.203 --> 00:33:41.883
Why did they react so differently.

907
00:33:41.883 --> 00:33:44.103
Well, you know, so it's a very logical.

908
00:33:44.103 --> 00:33:45.883
They say, "Oh well, you know,"

909
00:33:45.883 --> 00:33:47.643
and the one who didn't, who wants to go home says,

910
00:33:47.643 --> 00:33:49.403
"Well last time I was playing with a friend,

911
00:33:49.403 --> 00:33:51.495
another friend came and I got left out, you know."

912
00:33:51.495 --> 00:33:52.355
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

913
00:33:52.355 --> 00:33:55.815
<v ->So, it's very logical for them again.</v>

914
00:33:55.815 --> 00:33:57.115
And they understand.

915
00:33:57.115 --> 00:33:59.455
And they can empathize, they can understand.

916
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:02.035
Everybody's had those kind of feelings and experiences

917
00:34:02.035 --> 00:34:04.875
come up at some time or other.

918
00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:07.955
Then this gives rise then to

919
00:34:07.955 --> 00:34:09.555
all these steps that have come before

920
00:34:09.555 --> 00:34:11.075
and the understanding they've gained,

921
00:34:11.075 --> 00:34:13.495
they start to see now that the emotions

922
00:34:13.495 --> 00:34:14.575
can be transformed.

923
00:34:14.575 --> 00:34:16.727
They can start to have a choice

924
00:34:16.727 --> 00:34:19.147
as to what they're going to respond to.

925
00:34:19.147 --> 00:34:21.167
So they know that their feelings

926
00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:23.047
and that their thoughts

927
00:34:23.047 --> 00:34:24.107
are going to influence the way

928
00:34:24.107 --> 00:34:25.467
that they see a situation.

929
00:34:25.467 --> 00:34:29.697
They're going to be able now to

930
00:34:30.937 --> 00:34:33.029
as they start to recognize their,

931
00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:35.669
more in touch with their feelings, their thoughts,

932
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:37.709
they're going to start to become more aware

933
00:34:37.709 --> 00:34:41.289
of when anger is arising or frustration.

934
00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:43.189
And before they explode,

935
00:34:43.189 --> 00:34:45.069
the idea is that they take space.

936
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:47.489
So we've got a whole sort of 10-step

937
00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:52.449
conflict resolution approach to dealing with issues.

938
00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:54.769
And we also have what we call the five R's,

939
00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:58.389
which is a way of viewing

940
00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:01.349
sort of mistakes or obstacles and difficulties

941
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:05.089
that arise in ourselves as opportunities.

942
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:07.209
The first "R" would be remembering.

943
00:35:07.209 --> 00:35:10.249
So when we start to feel this energy, you know,

944
00:35:10.249 --> 00:35:11.033
bubbling up in us,

945
00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:11.733
we start to feel,

946
00:35:11.733 --> 00:35:14.113
"Oh, I'm getting really, really frustrated."

947
00:35:14.113 --> 00:35:15.673
Before you explode,

948
00:35:15.673 --> 00:35:16.773
because you know once you explode

949
00:35:16.773 --> 00:35:17.753
it makes a big mess,

950
00:35:17.753 --> 00:35:20.593
and we start creating and affecting everybody else

951
00:35:20.593 --> 00:35:21.513
around us,

952
00:35:21.513 --> 00:35:24.513
and it actually doesn't bring us what we want.

953
00:35:24.513 --> 00:35:25.523
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

954
00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:26.999
<v ->Right, going back to that step one.</v>

955
00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:29.019
<v Voiceover>Very important thing to learn early in life.</v>

956
00:35:29.019 --> 00:35:29.839
<v ->Exactly.</v>

957
00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:30.779
<v Voiceover>Because many, many people</v>

958
00:35:30.779 --> 00:35:32.039
go to their grave and never learn this.

959
00:35:32.039 --> 00:35:33.539
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

960
00:35:33.539 --> 00:35:34.499
That's absolutely true.

961
00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:37.419
And we could avoid so many problems

962
00:35:37.419 --> 00:35:39.219
and so much sadness and difficulty,

963
00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:39.659
couldn't we?

964
00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:40.419
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

965
00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:42.859
<v ->So I think it's really important work.</v>

966
00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:44.559
<v Voiceover>Very, very.</v>

967
00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:48.499
And what do you see when you,

968
00:35:48.499 --> 00:35:50.179
when the kids have cycled through,

969
00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:51.439
what age group, what age range

970
00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:53.919
are we talking about?

971
00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:58.079
<v ->Here, it's just, we have a program from preschool</v>

972
00:35:58.079 --> 00:36:01.759
through, so three years old through 10 years old.

973
00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:02.479
<v Voiceover>10 years old.</v>

974
00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:03.299
So that's good span.

975
00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:05.463
You have them for a number of years there.

976
00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.203
And what have you seen

977
00:36:07.203 --> 00:36:09.203
coming out the other end at the age of 10,

978
00:36:09.203 --> 00:36:10.443
by the age of 10?

979
00:36:10.443 --> 00:36:12.043
How good can it be?

980
00:36:12.043 --> 00:36:13.863
(laughs)

981
00:36:13.863 --> 00:36:17.623
<v ->Well, we see children who are just much,</v>

982
00:36:17.623 --> 00:36:21.363
and definitely can articulate their feelings

983
00:36:21.363 --> 00:36:23.643
in a situation on a very different level.

984
00:36:23.643 --> 00:36:27.203
They go in, they can see all the interconnected pieces

985
00:36:27.203 --> 00:36:30.463
of a situation.

986
00:36:30.463 --> 00:36:32.883
They're also a model for their parents,

987
00:36:32.883 --> 00:36:35.663
even actually at preschool age,

988
00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:36.683
and kindergarten age,

989
00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:38.043
they can model for their parents

990
00:36:38.043 --> 00:36:39.683
how to deal with your emotions

991
00:36:39.683 --> 00:36:41.083
when they start to arise.

992
00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:42.423
"You know, you just need to take some space

993
00:36:42.423 --> 00:36:43.523
"and cool down."

994
00:36:43.523 --> 00:36:44.383
<v Voiceover>Uh hmm.</v>

995
00:36:44.383 --> 00:36:48.123
<v ->And then we, when we take space and cool down,</v>

996
00:36:48.123 --> 00:36:50.283
anyway there's, then we can come back when we feel

997
00:36:50.283 --> 00:36:52.223
we're ready to, to the situation.

998
00:36:52.223 --> 00:36:55.303
So we always have a peace room

999
00:36:55.303 --> 00:36:57.483
and a place for children to be able to do that.

1000
00:36:57.483 --> 00:37:00.413
You know, a designated area

1001
00:37:00.413 --> 00:37:01.823
so that they can get the space and cool down

1002
00:37:01.823 --> 00:37:05.113
when they need to.

1003
00:37:05.113 --> 00:37:08.689
So they model that for their parents.

1004
00:37:08.689 --> 00:37:11.929
We've heard that children who've left the school

1005
00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.269
and gone into public school,

1006
00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:15.829
that they become the models

1007
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:18.129
for other children in the school.

1008
00:37:18.129 --> 00:37:21.349
That they help with conflict resolution.

1009
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:25.429
They teach children how to use their bracelets

1010
00:37:25.429 --> 00:37:27.209
as power beads

1011
00:37:27.209 --> 00:37:29.049
to help to find their power, you know.

1012
00:37:29.049 --> 00:37:33.349
And that's one of the activities and the tools we use.

1013
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:37.289
So there's definitely, it goes with them

1014
00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:39.189
and they continue to use it.

1015
00:37:39.189 --> 00:37:40.349
But I think the longer,

1016
00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:41.729
the most important thing then

1017
00:37:41.729 --> 00:37:44.089
is to actually bridge that gap between

1018
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:45.949
home and school.

1019
00:37:45.949 --> 00:37:49.869
And for the parents to be a part of the process as well

1020
00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:50.829
and the program,

1021
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:53.569
so that they can take a lot of these activities home

1022
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:56.143
and keep it going after the children leave school.

1023
00:37:56.143 --> 00:38:00.043
You know, there's a

1024
00:38:00.043 --> 00:38:01.545
it's a very strong current,

1025
00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:04.945
a very, it's a big world out there.

1026
00:38:04.945 --> 00:38:07.325
And there's a lot of different things that can come in

1027
00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:11.425
and influence a child's life

1028
00:38:11.425 --> 00:38:12.485
and our lives.

1029
00:38:12.485 --> 00:38:15.685
So the longer it can be these practices

1030
00:38:15.685 --> 00:38:18.405
and these ways of thinking can be reinforced

1031
00:38:18.405 --> 00:38:19.465
for the children,

1032
00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:22.045
the easier it's going to be and more longevity.

1033
00:38:22.045 --> 00:38:24.655
And that's what I tried to create

1034
00:38:24.655 --> 00:38:25.725
with this program,

1035
00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:27.445
was something that was very integrated,

1036
00:38:27.445 --> 00:38:28.827
and that really would make

1037
00:38:28.827 --> 00:38:31.447
that shift in the mind of the child.

1038
00:38:31.447 --> 00:38:34.627

1039
00:38:34.627 --> 00:38:36.507
