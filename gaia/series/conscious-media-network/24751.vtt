00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:02.218
<v ->If you haven't already done so,</v>

2
00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:04.756
please watch part one from our previous line-up

3
00:00:04.756 --> 00:00:06.016
before you see this part,

4
00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:08.713
because it's a continuation of the conversation.

5
00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.219
In this interview, Burton talks about some of the elements

6
00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.278
of health that have to be addressed

7
00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:16.365
to both prevent and reverse cancer.

8
00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:23.399 line:15% 
We left off with talking about the fact that

9
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.241
up to 14% of Alzheimer's is directly related

10
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.871
to mad cow syndrome.

11
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:32.047
This is not being reported.

12
00:00:32.047 --> 00:00:37.047
It's not being reported because the pharmaceutical indus--

13
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:41.081
<v ->Because of the purple pill that's being sold on television</v>

14
00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:45.582
and in newspapers, they don't want to ruffle the feathers

15
00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:47.928
of the agencies that handle the

16
00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:50.467
pharmaceutical industrial complex.

17
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.704
They'll be punished.

18
00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:53.784
<v Regina>So it keeps going back to this complex.</v>

19
00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:57.446
<v ->It keeps going back to the fact that,</v>

20
00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:01.467
what's his name, the guy from Arizona, McCaren?

21
00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:02.065
<v Regina>McCain?</v>

22
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.520
<v ->McCain, McCain-Feingold Act.</v>

23
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.532
The McCain-Feingold Act is not functioning.

24
00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:12.093
We're being sold down the river by the politicians.

25
00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:15.122
This is being allowed to happen.

26
00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:18.938
We no longer have oversight,

27
00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:22.047
and the government's rampant.

28
00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:27.927
We have to stop the financial supplementation

29
00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:33.977
to Congress, Senate, by lobbyists.

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.539
We have more lobbyists than we have Congressmen,

31
00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:40.525
and that's what it amounts to, we're being--

32
00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:41.549
<v Regina>And that's all really spiked</v>

33
00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.469
in the last few years, obviously.

34
00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.880
We could do another hour just on that.

35
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.710
Okay, so we can see where the problem is.

36
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.694
<v ->Yeah, I testified before Congress</v>

37
00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:57.032
showing how Sloan Kettering allowed these people,

38
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.102
they did a dastardly thing,

39
00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:04.423
and it went in one ear and out the other.

40
00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:08.098
They were kind, I gave them my books,

41
00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:10.680
they shook my hand, they thanked me,

42
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.755
nothing ever happened.

43
00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:15.254
<v Regina>Right, and this is a story I've heard</v>

44
00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:17.042
over and over.
<v Burton>Because of</v>

45
00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.149
Right.
<v Burton>the lobbyists.</v>

46
00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.535
<v Regina>So if we try to go with the system,</v>

47
00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:26.276
if we watch television, if we follow the ads,

48
00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:29.475
if we go buy every little purple, green, and blue pill,

49
00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:31.659
basically we're in trouble.

50
00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.189
Our bodies are already toxic.

51
00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.596
The chances are one in two we're going to

52
00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:36.694
come down with cancer,

53
00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:39.147
heart disease is right up on its tail,

54
00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:42.113
and number one, we're dying at the hands

55
00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:45.697
of our medical care providers.

56
00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:48.512
So let's now go the other direction entirely

57
00:02:48.512 --> 00:02:50.079
and take full responsibility,

58
00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.957
and say we're unplugging from that system.

59
00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:55.826
First of all, most people are terrified to unplug.

60
00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.826
For example, I pay $450 a month for an HMO's healthcare

61
00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:05.140
that I never use, because if I really want to be helped

62
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.220
I usually go to an alternative-care provider

63
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.603
that's not covered for, that's not covered.

64
00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:12.744
I keep it for what?

65
00:03:12.744 --> 00:03:15.229
Because being driven by fear like most people.

66
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.170
"Oh, what if something catastrophic happens.

67
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.721
"What if the Big C came into my life, for example."

68
00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:22.834
They don't cover the things I would use anyway.

69
00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:25.308
How do we begin to unplug from this,

70
00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:27.068
and how do we begin to take care of ourselves?

71
00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:30.129
<v ->We must, on a state by state level,</v>

72
00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.294
demand what they have in the state of Washington

73
00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:35.248
where alternative medicine is covered

74
00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.766
equal to every other medicine.

75
00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.248
That's what's necessary.

76
00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:41.508
<v Regina>We were just talking about this.</v>

77
00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:44.750
Is Washington the only state that offers this?

78
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.639
<v ->To my knowledge I think they're the only state</v>

79
00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.253
at the moment that demands that insurance companies,

80
00:03:50.253 --> 00:03:51.737
and we went through the Supreme Court

81
00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:53.517
of the state of Washington,

82
00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.738
demands that the insurance companies

83
00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:59.757
cover holistic medicine equally.

84
00:03:59.757 --> 00:04:02.391
<v Regina>So we need to start lobbying on a,</v>

85
00:04:02.391 --> 00:04:04.809
not just a regional, but a state level,

86
00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.466
to say that, okay.
<v Burton>Absolutely.</v>

87
00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:07.883
<v Regina>So we have to take political action</v>

88
00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:08.503
to make sure that--

89
00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:10.539
<v ->And also there's no reason why we can't do it</v>

90
00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.800
on a national level for Medicare.

91
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.579
<v Regina>True.</v>

92
00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.320
<v ->I'm on Medicare, I'm 79 years old.</v>

93
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.444
<v Regina>And looking fabulous.</v>

94
00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:19.776
<v ->I do a lot.</v>

95
00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Regina>Yes, I hear you do.</v>

96
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.038
<v ->I do a lot of prevention medicine.</v>

97
00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:23.448
That doesn't mean I didn't have cancer,

98
00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:25.187
I've had cancer twice.

99
00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:25.869
<v Regina>What kind did you--</v>

100
00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.490
<v ->So I know what I'm talking about.</v>

101
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.876
I had kidney failure.

102
00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:37.132
As you age, your organs age, and so you must cleanse them,

103
00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:40.001
detoxify, detoxify, detoxify.

104
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.637
There's a wonderful doctor by the name of Sherry Rogers

105
00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:46.422
who did a book Detoxify or Die.

106
00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:48.161
I think she lives in the Sacramento,

107
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:51.061
in the Sarasota area of Florida.

108
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:54.224
You might want to contact her, she's marvelous.

109
00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:55.526
<v Regina>Okay, Detoxify or Die.</v>

110
00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:58.918
<v ->Sherry Rogers, Detoxify or Die is her book.</v>

111
00:04:58.918 --> 00:05:01.746
<v Regina>So, along that line,</v>

112
00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:03.526
we can take political action,

113
00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:05.488
try to get our states, our states,

114
00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.046
our federal government to acknowledge

115
00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:08.209
and begin picking up the costs

116
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.181
for some of these alternative therapies.

117
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.229
In the meanwhile, we're on our own.

118
00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.842
So what can we do in a preventative sense

119
00:05:14.842 --> 00:05:16.708
to make sure that we put ourselves

120
00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:19.439
in the best possible position for a healthy

121
00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.258
and energetic life?

122
00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:24.308
<v ->The number one is diet and nutrition.</v>

123
00:05:24.818 --> 00:05:28.631
You need some exercise, you gotta move around a bit.

124
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:33.621
You must drink pure water, shower with pure water.

125
00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:37.337
Women should definitely have thermograms

126
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.703
rather than radiation.
<v Regina>Mammograms.</v>

127
00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:41.958
<v Burton>Radiation causes cancer.</v>

128
00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.961
Organic food, vegetables,

129
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:48.524
and range roamed beef and chicken if you're doing it.

130
00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:51.889
Be careful that you don't have toxic fish.

131
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.962
And sleep, rest.

132
00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:57.623
<v Regina>What about some of the culprits,</v>

133
00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:01.585
like coffee, sugar, white flour?

134
00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:05.724
<v ->I just finished a film on depression,</v>

135
00:06:05.724 --> 00:06:09.723
and depression is epidemic in this country.

136
00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:14.493
43 million people are on drugs

137
00:06:14.493 --> 00:06:18.622
for depression, anxiety, and panic disorder.

138
00:06:18.622 --> 00:06:20.841
That's a quarter of our population.

139
00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:23.711
Addiction is rampant.

140
00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.880
Addiction, depression,

141
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.336
and attention deficit are all similar.

142
00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:34.183
It's because the diet that we have

143
00:06:34.183 --> 00:06:38.215
is devoid of good nutrition.

144
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:44.044
When they use pesticides on the crops in farming,

145
00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:45.719
those pesticides go in the ground

146
00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.381
and kill the organic matter that separates the minerals

147
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:53.468
and the nutrition from the soil.

148
00:06:54.402 --> 00:06:57.857
So they use pesticides and herbicides.

149
00:06:57.857 --> 00:07:01.963
Women who drink two to three glasses of wine a week

150
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.676
have 200 and 300% more cancer of the breast.

151
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:08.482
<v Regina>A lot of chemicals used on grapes.</v>

152
00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:10.155
<v ->Remember Cesar Chavez?</v>

153
00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:12.581
He says, "You're killing my pickers with the stuff."

154
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:13.699
<v Regina>Oh, yeah,</v>
<v Burton>You don't think</v>

155
00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:14.596
<v Regina>I mean multiple</v>
<v Burton>they scrubbed those</v>

156
00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:15.756
<v Regina>layers.</v>
<v Burton>grapes, do you?</v>

157
00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:16.625
<v Regina>No.</v>

158
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.653
<v Burton>That's why you need organic wine as well.</v>

159
00:07:18.653 --> 00:07:21.126
<v Regina>Very true, I did a story on that one time,</v>

160
00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:22.534
and was absolutely shocked to find out

161
00:07:22.534 --> 00:07:25.321
the number of applications per crop.

162
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:26.595
Very true.

163
00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:28.796
Okay, so we have that.

164
00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:30.070
Where were we?

165
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.516
Oh, I was asking you about coffee, and sugar,

166
00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:33.518
and white flour, and--

167
00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:38.518
<v ->Well, coffee, I drink, I like coffee.</v>

168
00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.357
And although right now I'm on a detoxification program,

169
00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:45.646
I'm off it, because coffee, caffeine does effect,

170
00:07:45.646 --> 00:07:49.123
and coffee effects homeopathy, the sunnel energy.

171
00:07:49.123 --> 00:07:53.077
So I'm off, I'm drinking herbal tea at the moment.

172
00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:56.670
But when I drink coffee, it's organic,

173
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.563
because these pesticides go into the prostate,

174
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.304
they go into the breast, they go all over the body

175
00:08:03.304 --> 00:08:05.607
and are causing all kinds of problems.

176
00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:10.607
I drink decaffeinated Swiss water system.

177
00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:14.246
I use a paper filter of a brown paper

178
00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:15.846
rather than the bleached,

179
00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:18.831
and you have less toxins that way.

180
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.368
Is it right?

181
00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:22.469
It's better than--

182
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:23.652
<v Regina>Better than doing it the other way.</v>

183
00:08:23.652 --> 00:08:25.989
<v ->Than conventional coffee.</v>

184
00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:27.673
I happen to love Peet's.

185
00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.491
<v Regina>Yeah, Peet's is great coffee.</v>

186
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:31.731
The only thing I wonder about, and I love coffee too,

187
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.459
and I drink similarly to you,

188
00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:36.894
except mostly caffeinated organic coffee when I do,

189
00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:39.432
but my understanding is that it takes quite a long time

190
00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:41.010
to clear from the liver.

191
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.893
It seems like this might be an issue when it comes to

192
00:08:44.893 --> 00:08:47.656
the whole subject of detoxifying.

193
00:08:47.656 --> 00:08:48.253
<v ->No question.</v>

194
00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:51.698
The liver is like the spoke of the wheel of the body,

195
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.076
and it has to really be cleaned.

196
00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:58.658
It's amazing the multi-functions of the liver.

197
00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:01.733
You know, that's one of the problems with medicine,

198
00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:03.653
they really don't know how the body works.

199
00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:04.970
They don't teach it in medical school.

200
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.703
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

201
00:09:06.703 --> 00:09:10.526
<v ->So that's where the holistic physician has to learn that.</v>

202
00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:13.614
<v Regina>So what about the subject of sugar?</v>

203
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.273
<v ->Sugar is poison.</v>

204
00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:21.007
Sugar is death.

205
00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:22.302
<v Regina>The white death.</v>

206
00:09:22.302 --> 00:09:25.012
There was a book called White Death once upon a time.

207
00:09:25.012 --> 00:09:25.958
<v ->Yep.</v>

208
00:09:26.463 --> 00:09:29.800
There's artificial's like Stevia.

209
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.076
There's all grades of Stevia like in everything else,

210
00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:35.357
but Stevia seems to be good.

211
00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:39.795
The aspartame is a deadly excitotoxin

212
00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:43.783
that is a cause of many problems, including cancer.

213
00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:47.537
It's in Equal, and aspartame is in

214
00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:51.477
whatever the other sugar substitutes are.

215
00:09:52.144 --> 00:09:55.227
Diet drinks, diet colas.

216
00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.516
It's very serious.

217
00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:59.421
<v Regina>What about Splenda?</v>

218
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.694
<v ->I don't think it's so good, I'm not too sure about that.</v>

219
00:10:03.694 --> 00:10:07.672
<v Regina>Yeah, and then, as you say, you have Stevia.</v>

220
00:10:07.672 --> 00:10:09.496
What about now going to the more

221
00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:12.770
organic forms of sweeteners,

222
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.269
what about honey and agave nectar,

223
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:17.634
organic agave nectar?

224
00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:18.967
<v ->That's pretty good stuff.</v>

225
00:10:18.967 --> 00:10:20.715
<v Regina>Yeah, because my understanding of agave nectar,</v>

226
00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:24.631
which is what we use, it's even suitable for diabetics.

227
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.148
<v ->The metabolism in honey is better,</v>

228
00:10:27.148 --> 00:10:30.092
particularly local honey, I do recommend.

229
00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:32.877
I've learned to do things without it.

230
00:10:33.327 --> 00:10:34.696
Although I like my cookies.

231
00:10:34.696 --> 00:10:36.151
<v Regina>Right, okay. (laughing)</v>

232
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:37.555
<v ->And my Haagen-Dazs.</v>

233
00:10:37.555 --> 00:10:38.890
<v Regina>So if you're going to do it,</v>

234
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.607
then we're going to go with,

235
00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:42.325
if you need sweeteners in your life

236
00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:44.148
we're going to go with something like Stevia,

237
00:10:44.148 --> 00:10:46.986
or organic agave, or local honey.

238
00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:51.986
<v ->Yeah, but you brought up the subject of the liver,</v>

239
00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:54.569
which means one has to detoxify.

240
00:10:54.569 --> 00:10:57.032
Gallbladders, must detoxify liver,

241
00:10:57.032 --> 00:11:00.616
must detoxify entire body, including heavy metals.

242
00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:03.880
Detoxification saunas,

243
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.078
a far infrared sauna is very important.

244
00:11:06.078 --> 00:11:06.885
<v Regina>Oh, I've heard about this.</v>

245
00:11:06.885 --> 00:11:08.869
Can you talk a little bit about that?

246
00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:12.945
<v ->The far infrared sauna, you don't need a lot of heat,</v>

247
00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:17.945
and it works like the sun, it has the same kind of warmth,

248
00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:22.960
and resonance of the sun, and the rays of the sun.

249
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.501
So far infrared spectrum is very, very healthy,

250
00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:29.188
and it helps you dump more toxins.

251
00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.902
They've taken the perspiration from patients

252
00:11:31.902 --> 00:11:35.170
in ordinary saunas, and in far infrared saunas,

253
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.870
and I think there's a 15% higher rate

254
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.784
of heavy metals, and poisons, and toxins coming out.

255
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:45.067
So it's very, very important to detoxify.

256
00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:46.411
<v Regina>Now we can do this through heat,</v>

257
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:50.229
we can do this through sweat in our own exercise, right?

258
00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:53.477
<v ->Yes, but the far infrared is infinitely</v>

259
00:11:53.477 --> 00:11:56.018
higher rates of dumping.

260
00:11:56.018 --> 00:11:57.939
And there's key leading aspects.

261
00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:00.081
EDTA baths are very good.

262
00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:01.041
<v Regina>What's that mean?</v>

263
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:04.155
<v ->EDTA is a product that they use</v>

264
00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:07.537
for pulling out heavy metals from the body,

265
00:12:07.537 --> 00:12:09.978
and other poisons and toxins.

266
00:12:09.978 --> 00:12:12.838
You can do it intravenously, you can do it orally,

267
00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:15.071
and you can also take baths in it

268
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:20.631
with apple cider vinegar, or Epsom salts.

269
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.711
<v Regina>What about the</v>
<v Burton>Or baking soda.</v>

270
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:24.862
<v Regina>subject of ultraviolet therapy</v>

271
00:12:24.862 --> 00:12:26.525
where a small amount of the blood is removed,

272
00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:28.520
exposed to ultraviolet, what can you tell us

273
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.315
about that as well?
<v Burton>Ultraviolet</v>

274
00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:30.078
<v Burton>is excellent.</v>

275
00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:32.700
Usually what the doctors do in holistic medicine,

276
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.306
they remove the blood, and then they ozonate it.

277
00:12:36.966 --> 00:12:39.887
They just take a small amount, say 20 cc's,

278
00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:42.063
and then they put it through an ultraviolet.

279
00:12:42.063 --> 00:12:46.243
The object here is to kill all the pathogens in the blood.

280
00:12:46.243 --> 00:12:49.742
And then they reinsert that blood into the body.

281
00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:52.984
When they do, it notifies the immune system

282
00:12:52.984 --> 00:12:56.302
that these dead critters are the ones to go after.

283
00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:57.262
<v Regina>Oh, interesting.</v>

284
00:12:57.262 --> 00:13:01.025
<v ->It signals the body to clean itself out,</v>

285
00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:04.117
so you have to have enough food, and nutrition,

286
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.152
in order to do that.

287
00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.590
That's why eating is so important.

288
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.032
It is very, very important to have a huge,

289
00:13:11.032 --> 00:13:14.060
delicious, nutritious breakfast.

290
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.735
<v Regina>So what would that look like in real life?</v>

291
00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:18.572
<v ->Breakfast as a king, lunch as a prince,</v>

292
00:13:18.572 --> 00:13:21.079
and supper as a pauper.
<v Regina>As a pauper.</v>

293
00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:24.897
<v Burton>So I eat my main meal at lunch,</v>

294
00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:29.132
but breakfast, eggs are very healthy, they're much maligned.

295
00:13:29.132 --> 00:13:32.214
This business of whites of eggs and no yolks and so forth

296
00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:33.772
is total nonsense.

297
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.694
The whole story of cholesterol is total nonsense.

298
00:13:36.694 --> 00:13:38.315
<v Regina>Can you talk about that for a moment?</v>

299
00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:41.098
We have chickens, and have the most splendid,

300
00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:42.592
organic eggs on the planet.

301
00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:43.338
<v ->Yeah, they're great.</v>

302
00:13:43.338 --> 00:13:44.526
<v Regina>And eat lots of them.</v>

303
00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:46.624
<v ->Yeah, very healthy.
<v Regina>It's wonderful.</v>

304
00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:49.441
<v Burton>The whole cholesterol story is wrong.</v>

305
00:13:49.441 --> 00:13:52.193
It is the low density lipid and the high density lipids

306
00:13:52.193 --> 00:13:53.145
that have to be watched,

307
00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:56.918
because you don't want high low-densities.

308
00:13:56.918 --> 00:14:00.348
The triglycerides, these are the suckers that kill.

309
00:14:00.348 --> 00:14:01.760
The...

310
00:14:04.987 --> 00:14:06.267
<v Regina>That create the plaque.</v>

311
00:14:06.267 --> 00:14:09.061
<v ->That create plaque, and infections in the blood</v>

312
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:11.141
are very, very important.

313
00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:14.336
Little protein A, and sticky proteins, and so forth.

314
00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:17.212
Cholesterol is necessary in your body

315
00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:21.532
for the maintenance of good, healthy body.

316
00:14:21.532 --> 00:14:24.870
So the story of high cholesterol is total nonsense,

317
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.571
particularly there's no correlation between older people

318
00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:31.368
and cholesterol and heart disease.

319
00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:36.791
But the LDL's are to be watched.

320
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:41.150
So eating cholesterol foods is not the way to go.

321
00:14:41.762 --> 00:14:43.711
We manufacture cholesterol in our body,

322
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:47.433
multiple times more than we consume.

323
00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:48.199
<v Regina>And in fact I thought that</v>

324
00:14:48.199 --> 00:14:51.601
the good, organic eggs actually had a beneficial effect

325
00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:53.041
on positive cholesterol,
<v Burton>Highly beneficial.</v>

326
00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.300
<v Regina>cholesterol levels.</v>

327
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.505
<v ->They're much maligned.</v>

328
00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:56.534
<v Regina>Right.</v>

329
00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:00.305
<v ->Great nutrition, inexpensive.</v>

330
00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:02.586
Preserves, handles well.

331
00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:04.154
<v Regina>As long as you do organic again?</v>

332
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:08.729
<v ->Yeah, and of course, so,</v>

333
00:15:08.729 --> 00:15:11.407
I like a good breakfast, cereal,

334
00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:14.078
fiber is extremely important.

335
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.153
One of the things that people don't discuss,

336
00:15:16.153 --> 00:15:20.066
and they must discuss, is the bowel movements.

337
00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:23.011
You know, it's a forbidden subject.

338
00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:27.495
If you don't have two to three bowel movements a day

339
00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:29.235
you're constipated.

340
00:15:29.235 --> 00:15:30.013
<v Regina>Right.</v>

341
00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.542
<v ->Very important.</v>

342
00:15:32.117 --> 00:15:34.545
And you can, it's easy.

343
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:35.727
You go to a health food store,

344
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:40.727
and you get some, some of the products are too harsh.

345
00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:42.531
<v Regina>What are some that are natural</v>

346
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:44.536
that are not harsh on the body, and don't create--

347
00:15:44.536 --> 00:15:48.152
<v ->There are programs, there are programs you can take.</v>

348
00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:52.346
Cascara can be harsh.

349
00:15:52.996 --> 00:15:55.971
There's a whole series of them, it's important.

350
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:59.145
Another aspect of having two to three bowel movements a day

351
00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:02.045
is the acid alkaline of the body.

352
00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:04.071
Cancer patients heal twice as fast

353
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.612
when they're in the optimum pH.

354
00:16:07.612 --> 00:16:08.231
<v Regina>Right.</v>

355
00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:11.452
<v ->To acid, cancer, and other diseases.</v>

356
00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:13.991
<v Regina>And we're a chronically acidic culture,</v>

357
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.749
the western world.
<v Burton>Because of</v>

358
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:15.249
<v Burton>our diet.</v>

359
00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:19.459
Sugars, white flour, so forth and so on.

360
00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:22.059
<v Regina>So balancing out the,</v>

361
00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:24.277
let's go on to that a minute more,

362
00:16:24.277 --> 00:16:27.850
the alkalinity factors are really natural produce.

363
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.183
<v ->Yeah, and it's very difficult to do with diet alone.</v>

364
00:16:31.183 --> 00:16:34.730
So the use of Rubidium and Cesium,

365
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.738
these are minerals that can help balance out

366
00:16:38.738 --> 00:16:41.425
the acid alkaline of the body.

367
00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:44.679
But a cancer patient, I've been told by physicians,

368
00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:47.484
that a cancer patient will heal twice as fast

369
00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:49.905
if they have optimum pH and not too acid.

370
00:16:49.905 --> 00:16:51.469
<v Regina>Makes perfect sense.</v>

371
00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.315
<v ->But they pay no attention to it.</v>

372
00:16:53.315 --> 00:16:56.204
Most holistic physicians don't pay attention to it.

373
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.817
<v Regina>Well that's really why a lot of the people</v>

374
00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:01.441
that are using natural cures for cancer say,

375
00:17:01.441 --> 00:17:05.622
first of all, no sugar, no white flour, no coffee or tea,

376
00:17:05.622 --> 00:17:08.682
no caffeinated beverages, lots of leafy greens,

377
00:17:08.682 --> 00:17:12.647
loads of greens, green seems to be the color.

378
00:17:12.647 --> 00:17:14.073
<v ->Vegetables.</v>

379
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:19.234
Campbell just did a book on the China study, very important,

380
00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:23.197
that a plant-based diet is much healthier.

381
00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.539
That's the bottom line.

382
00:17:26.539 --> 00:17:30.123
But remember now, certain people cannot be vegetarians.

383
00:17:30.123 --> 00:17:30.997
<v Regina>Right.</v>

384
00:17:30.997 --> 00:17:33.397
<v ->If you're Scandinavian, and your family's been eating</v>

385
00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:37.034
for centuries reindeer, you may not be able to,

386
00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:38.101
you can't survive.

387
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:40.235
So different strokes for different folks.

388
00:17:40.235 --> 00:17:43.295
If you're Chinese, it very well could be.

389
00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:46.956
From India, you very well could be a vegetarian.

390
00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:49.190
But some people do need protein,

391
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.428
and sometimes the protein

392
00:17:50.428 --> 00:17:52.571
of beans and rice aren't sufficient.

393
00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.651
Or you don't get metabol volume.

394
00:17:54.651 --> 00:17:55.514
<v Regina>They need the amino acids</v>

395
00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:56.740
from meat.
<v Burton>Methylate.</v>

396
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.829
<v Regina>Wow, exactly.</v>

397
00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:01.336
<v ->The shortage of amino acids are one of the reasons</v>

398
00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:03.939
we have so much attention deficit,

399
00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:06.602
and depression, and anxiety.

400
00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:08.936
<v Regina>Amino acids.</v>

401
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.961
<v ->Amino acids.</v>

402
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:16.581
There's four different aspects of depression,

403
00:18:17.381 --> 00:18:19.258
and there's four different, you know,

404
00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:23.892
serotonin, caveolins, and GABA.

405
00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:27.535
<v Regina>So amino acid replacement is really essential</v>

406
00:18:27.535 --> 00:18:28.538
in terms of depression.

407
00:18:28.538 --> 00:18:29.956
<v ->You must eat it.</v>

408
00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:31.780
And sometimes you can't eat enough,

409
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.977
so you have to take supplementation.

410
00:18:33.977 --> 00:18:38.500
GABA, and taurine, and all these precursors,

411
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.835
these amino acid building blocks of protein

412
00:18:40.835 --> 00:18:44.490
that will produce the serotonin.

413
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.498
That's why people are on Zoloft,

414
00:18:46.498 --> 00:18:48.961
a serotonin uptake inhibitors.

415
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.497
They just keep to whatever serotonin

416
00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:51.883
you have in your body.

417
00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:54.737
But by supplementing you can get off these drugs.

418
00:18:54.737 --> 00:18:58.858
These drugs have horrible side effects, many of them.

419
00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:02.201
<v Regina>And as you said, a quarter of the population,</v>

420
00:19:02.201 --> 00:19:04.687
as many as a quarter of the population may be on them,

421
00:19:04.687 --> 00:19:06.569
including children.

422
00:19:06.569 --> 00:19:10.466
<v ->Those are the stats, the government statistics.</v>

423
00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:15.095
43 million are on these drugs.

424
00:19:15.095 --> 00:19:17.236
Drug companies don't want you to know this, do they?

425
00:19:17.236 --> 00:19:18.377
<v Regina>No, and in fact,</v>

426
00:19:18.377 --> 00:19:21.897
you're associated with Kevin Trudeau.

427
00:19:21.897 --> 00:19:22.398
<v ->Yes.</v>

428
00:19:22.398 --> 00:19:23.119
<v Regina>You're friends.</v>

429
00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:23.772
<v ->Yes.</v>

430
00:19:23.772 --> 00:19:25.396
<v Regina>And he wrote the book</v>

431
00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:27.948
Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About.

432
00:19:27.948 --> 00:19:29.237
It sounds like the two of you

433
00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:31.316
have been searching along the same path

434
00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:32.703
for quite a while.

435
00:19:32.703 --> 00:19:35.647
<v ->Absolutely, Kevin is right on the money.</v>

436
00:19:35.647 --> 00:19:37.588
<v Regina>Well, his book certainly seems to be</v>

437
00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:39.188
on the money to me as I've read it.

438
00:19:39.188 --> 00:19:41.929
He goes into great lengths to explain

439
00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:44.243
how the pharmaceutical industry,

440
00:19:44.243 --> 00:19:46.324
in conjunction with our--

441
00:19:46.324 --> 00:19:50.451
<v ->FDA and the commercial,</v>

442
00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:55.451
what's the other one, the FDA, there's another,

443
00:19:56.818 --> 00:19:58.330
truth in advertising.

444
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.010
They let the pharmaceutical companies off the hook

445
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.165
and they go after anybody who produces

446
00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:07.149
a natural, inexpensive product.

447
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:09.390
Hydrogen sulfide is a good example.

448
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.670
<v Regina>Anything in wrapping it up</v>

449
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.736
that you would like to say?

450
00:20:11.736 --> 00:20:13.710
We could go on with each disease forever,

451
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:14.830
but I'm gonna tell them to buy your book.

452
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.456
<v ->The Federal Communication, FTC, the FTC--</v>

453
00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:21.368
<v Regina>FCC, Federal Communications Commission, right.</v>

454
00:20:21.368 --> 00:20:23.608
<v ->That's the communication, trade commission.</v>

455
00:20:23.608 --> 00:20:24.538
<v Regina>Oh trade commission.</v>

456
00:20:24.538 --> 00:20:25.168
<v ->FTC.</v>

457
00:20:25.168 --> 00:20:26.017
<v Regina>Federal Trade Commission, gotcha.</v>

458
00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:31.017
<v ->They work as mafia with the FDA together</v>

459
00:20:31.712 --> 00:20:35.721
to stamp out anything that works that is inexpensive,

460
00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:39.144
and of course you have phonys around, so buyer beware.

461
00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:39.805
<v Regina>Right.</v>

462
00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:42.845
<v ->But nobody's more phony than the drug industry.</v>

463
00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:44.062
<v Regina>So anything else you'd like to say</v>

464
00:20:44.062 --> 00:20:45.139
in wrapping it up?

465
00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:47.594
Then we can let people start searching some,

466
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:50.902
Googling some of these names you've given us today.

467
00:20:51.932 --> 00:20:53.649
<v ->The mind-body we haven't covered,</v>

468
00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:54.726
and it's very, very important.

469
00:20:54.726 --> 00:20:56.211
<v Regina>Yes, yes, you're right.</v>

470
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.372
<v ->You have to have a good relationship,</v>

471
00:20:58.372 --> 00:21:02.125
you have to have a good relationship in your love life.

472
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:06.892
You have to like what you do, and if you don't,

473
00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:10.593
you have to modify it, because it'll come and whack you.

474
00:21:10.593 --> 00:21:12.396
It affects your organs, and your systems,

475
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.768
and your entire being.

476
00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:18.892
The mind-body plays an enormous role.

477
00:21:18.892 --> 00:21:20.075
<v Regina>I couldn't agree more.</v>

478
00:21:20.075 --> 00:21:21.671
<v ->And there's no way of beating it</v>

479
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:24.070
because it produces stress.

480
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.146
Stress brings on cortisol, and cortisol brings on

481
00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:32.905
the road to death, a faster death.

482
00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:36.310
Heart disease, and so forth, so the emotions.

483
00:21:36.957 --> 00:21:41.480
When people have shocks, and stress,

484
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.015
they end up with multiple sclerosis,

485
00:21:43.015 --> 00:21:44.862
they end up with heart disease,

486
00:21:44.862 --> 00:21:48.743
they end up with liver failure, kidney failure.

487
00:21:48.743 --> 00:21:50.141
One thing leads to the other,

488
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.917
so the mind-body plays an enormous role.

489
00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:56.103
But remember, as a lot of people say,

490
00:21:56.103 --> 00:21:57.862
everything starts in the mind.

491
00:21:57.862 --> 00:22:02.043
No, in some cases, yes, in some cases,

492
00:22:02.043 --> 00:22:03.600
it's 90% of the problem.

493
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.723
In some cases it's only 10% of the problem.

494
00:22:05.723 --> 00:22:08.038
But once you're given the diagnosis of cancer,

495
00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:10.373
you've got stress, there's the mind-body,

496
00:22:10.373 --> 00:22:11.802
and it has to be addressed.

497
00:22:11.802 --> 00:22:12.852
<v Regina>Right.</v>

498
00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:15.440
And this is something that you can,

499
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.522
I remember when my son was about 14 years old

500
00:22:18.522 --> 00:22:20.655
I taught him about decision making,

501
00:22:20.655 --> 00:22:24.523
and told him your stomach will never lie to you. (laughing)

502
00:22:24.523 --> 00:22:27.200
It will always give you the reaction you need

503
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.817
to find out what is the correct course of action.

504
00:22:29.817 --> 00:22:30.917
<v ->Is that called the gut feeling?</v>

505
00:22:30.917 --> 00:22:33.039
<v Regina>The gut feeling, and it is truly,</v>

506
00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.876
I mean it is a chemical reaction that occurs simultaneously

507
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:38.618
in the brain and the gut, and the mind can rationalize,

508
00:22:38.618 --> 00:22:40.291
but it seems like the gut doesn't.

509
00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:44.493
If we really follow our gut, if it's gnawing,

510
00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:48.423
and dark in there, it's probably not going to serve us.

511
00:22:48.423 --> 00:22:50.626
There are simple ways, aren't there?

512
00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:55.748
<v ->If you simplify your life it's a hell of a lot better.</v>

513
00:22:56.853 --> 00:22:58.719
<v ->Another of our interviews you might enjoy,</v>

514
00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:00.212
if you like what Burton is saying,

515
00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:01.972
is Doctor Lorraine Day.

516
00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:04.894
Lorraine reversed her own end-stage cancer

517
00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:07.091
and has helped thousands of others do the same

518
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:09.533
by observing some fundamental health, diet,

519
00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:11.060
