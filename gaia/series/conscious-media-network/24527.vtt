00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:02.355
<v ->In part two of our talk with George Green,</v>

2
00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.007
we begin discussing what he calls

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.527
the "Big Picture," and it's big.

4
00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.663
From ancient Atlantean documents held by the Tibetan monks

5
00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:12.405
to nuclear energy and the future of our species,

6
00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.752
George holds nothing back in this fascinating

7
00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:17.020
but spine-chilling interview.

8
00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.850
If people watch all the interviews on your site,

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.886
they would walk away with this clear understanding,

10
00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:34.198
we have a very unique position in Earth's history.

11
00:00:34.198 --> 00:00:36.936
And everything that we've talked about,

12
00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.024
even in our previous interview,

13
00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:41.616
lots of changes coming down the pipe.

14
00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:44.424
Can you talk a little bit about how we have found ourselves

15
00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:48.276
as a species and as a planet in the situation we're in

16
00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:51.984
and what the opportunity of this time is?

17
00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:55.746
<v ->To give you a background of the planet itself,</v>

18
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.040
again, a little bit of my background.

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.848
I went to Colorado School of Mines, I majored in geophysics.

20
00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:04.656
We used to go out the back door, out of the chem lab,

21
00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.600
and go along what we'd call the hog bag,

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.632
and I looked at all of these,

23
00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:11.370
the remnants of prehistoric, you know,

24
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.422
everything was going on, the fish,

25
00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:16.680
and the dinosaurs, and everything is sitting right there.

26
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.180
No, this is at Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado,

27
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.946
so it's up a mile high, right?

28
00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:22.782
Where did this all happen?

29
00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.906
So the research I started looking at,

30
00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:27.714
it'd say, well the planet itself goes through

31
00:01:27.714 --> 00:01:30.684
various changes at time, and it turns out,

32
00:01:30.684 --> 00:01:32.736
from an astrological standpoint,

33
00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:35.832
we have to look at the planet Earth itself,

34
00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:40.366
is spinning around in this 365.25 day period

35
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:44.326
around our sun, which, you know, takes that time.

36
00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:47.244
And our moon, which is very an unusual object,

37
00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:50.086
it's perfectly round, it's always facing our planet,

38
00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:52.176
which is kind of unusual, because it's the only one

39
00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:54.548
in our known, that we know

40
00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.766
has a body that does that.

41
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.718
On any of the planets that we have any idea about,

42
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.632
that we can see.

43
00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:05.546
So as I started to research a little bit more,

44
00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:07.960
I started looking at some of the ancient documents

45
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.976
that they translated back,

46
00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:12.888
and it turned out, like, when I was in Japan,

47
00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:14.654
the most ancient documents said

48
00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:16.994
they came from a boat from the sky.

49
00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:22.198
As our friend David says, the word Zulu means star people.

50
00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:24.574
And I started looking into all of this, and I said,

51
00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:26.518
"Well, wait a minute, something is going on

52
00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:29.074
"with this planet that's a little bit different."

53
00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:31.846
Well, as my experience happened,

54
00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:35.266
I happened to join the Air Force at a young age, 18.

55
00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.732
I spent a year in electronics school.

56
00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.388
I already had two years prior to that,

57
00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:41.278
so they put me in a specialized school.

58
00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:43.114
I immediately was assigned

59
00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:45.310
to the Air Force Research and Development Center,

60
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.082
one of these quirks happened to be there,

61
00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:49.306
which is Edwards Air Force Base,

62
00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:51.358
which is out in the middle of the Mojave Desert.

63
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.146
On one morning, I did the post-flight inspection

64
00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:58.630
on the X-15, the forerunner of the space shuttle,

65
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.978
which is, the X-15 is just a rocket with skids, frankly.

66
00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:04.226
Anyway, when it landed,

67
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.956
it's about five miles north

68
00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.320
of the main base, where I was at,

69
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.596
and I was out with my Jeep and there was

70
00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:10.540
a couple hangers that I hadn't been to.

71
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.278
I was cleared for top secret, I just went inside this hangar

72
00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:15.618
and I looked at it, and went inside this room,

73
00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:19.110
and here's this round disc, this silver craft.

74
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.568
And I'm 10 feet away from it.

75
00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.242
It was kind of unusual, but I've been working

76
00:03:22.242 --> 00:03:24.546
on a lot of strange-looking equipment.

77
00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.634
Anyway, I come back to my commander,

78
00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:28.396
and I ask him, I says,

79
00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:31.242
"When can I work on that disc out there?"

80
00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:33.870
And he said, "Oh, that's an ion-powered craft.

81
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.400
"I-O-N powered craft,

82
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.884
"designed by Sikorsky, the helicopter people,

83
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.008
"for use in outer space."

84
00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:42.762
I accepted what he had to say, and I said,

85
00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:44.076
"Well, fine, when can I work on it?"

86
00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:46.704
And he says, "You can't, it's still a civilian project."

87
00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.432
Edwards is a crossover base.

88
00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:51.384
That's where the civilian contractors make the vehicles

89
00:03:51.384 --> 00:03:53.418
and the Air Force tests them if they want to use them,

90
00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:54.750
just so you know.

91
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.486
Anyway, I went back to my room,

92
00:03:57.486 --> 00:03:58.926
and I happened to be running around

93
00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:01.086
with the base photographer, and I said, you know,

94
00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:03.084
"Hey, get me some pictures of that round craft."

95
00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:04.596
I had everything else.

96
00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:06.394
And he said, "What'd they tell you about it?"

97
00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:08.448
Then he proceeded to show me pictures

98
00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.038
of the space craft along with two dead aliens.

99
00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:13.016
Now, the aliens were similar to,

100
00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:14.348
you've seen them in the movies,

101
00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:15.858
the grays and that type.

102
00:04:15.858 --> 00:04:17.984
Now, I didn't see the aliens, I'm 10 feet away

103
00:04:17.984 --> 00:04:20.072
from the space craft, so I'll never forget it.

104
00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:24.520
This confused me.

105
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.788
I mean, here I was, rah-rah for our government,

106
00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:28.336
and everything's going on,

107
00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:30.890
and top secret, why did my commander lie to me?

108
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.808
So the first thing I did was to go down and ask him.

109
00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:35.932
And first thing he did was remind me

110
00:04:35.932 --> 00:04:37.660
of my top secret clearance,

111
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.720
which was jail time and a fine if I said anything about it.

112
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.998
And the next thing he, we joked about it,

113
00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.464
as a matter of fact, because I said, the next thing,

114
00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:46.496
he said, "When the government's ready

115
00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:49.484
"to tell the truth about UFOs and ETs, they will.

116
00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:52.832
"Until then, you stick to the Sikorsky deal."

117
00:04:52.832 --> 00:04:55.352
And then he put me on duty, it was the last week in August.

118
00:04:55.352 --> 00:04:57.728
The next weekend was Armed Forces Day,

119
00:04:57.728 --> 00:04:59.112
they open up the base, let everybody go in,

120
00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.842
all the top secret stuff we have,

121
00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.786
except for these craft were,

122
00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:05.198
you know, several miles away from the main one.

123
00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:07.084
Anyway, within a very short period, for some reason,

124
00:05:07.084 --> 00:05:08.724
I was transferred off the base.

125
00:05:08.724 --> 00:05:10.200
Right.
<v Voiceover>Surprise.</v>

126
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.352
<v ->Duh.</v>

127
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.828
<v Voiceover>What year was this?</v>

128
00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:13.872
<v ->That was in 1958.</v>

129
00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:15.258
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

130
00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:17.564
So about a dozen years after Roswell,

131
00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:20.352
but before Lieutenant Corso started really outing--

132
00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:22.764
<v ->No, Corso was at Edwards the same time I was.</v>

133
00:05:22.764 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Voiceover>Yeah,. but he didn't really start working</v>

134
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.812
on the technology, or back using the back-engineering

135
00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:29.550
until, what, 61 or intertwining?

136
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.842
They were already doing it?

137
00:05:30.842 --> 00:05:32.210
<v ->Oh, sure, we were doing.</v>

138
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.370
Because I, the schooling I had,

139
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.802
was the old tube types, remember the old days,

140
00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:38.962
you had the tube to go in and change it?

141
00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:40.798
Well, the Air Force at that time,

142
00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:42.670
when we sent up an aircraft,

143
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.046
you know, the F-104, for instance,

144
00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:46.558
if you went up with it,

145
00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:49.042
I had to come back and I'd take out the whole equipment,

146
00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:51.202
we recheck everything, every time.

147
00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:53.074
Every time, they got new equipment,

148
00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:54.640
new tubes, everything, it was,

149
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.628
before and after, so I was a before-and-after check,

150
00:05:57.628 --> 00:05:59.354
all using tubes, and all the sudden,

151
00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:02.108
changes come in.

152
00:06:02.108 --> 00:06:04.086
I'm using transistors and diodes and everything.

153
00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:05.598
<v Voiceover>And that was in that same period of time?</v>

154
00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:06.606
<v ->Exactly.</v>

155
00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:08.262
<v Voiceover>So it was a little before the accounts.</v>

156
00:06:08.262 --> 00:06:09.522
<v ->It started to come out,</v>

157
00:06:09.522 --> 00:06:11.322
where I asked my CO, I said,

158
00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:13.824
"Why didn't they teach this in school?"

159
00:06:13.824 --> 00:06:17.028
And what basically, O-J-T, or on-the-job training,

160
00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:18.648
so all of the sudden, I'm looking

161
00:06:18.648 --> 00:06:20.342
at all this advanced equipment, and I said,

162
00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:21.294
"Well, where do you get that?"

163
00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:24.066
And he said, "We have think tanks that create this."

164
00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:26.876
And what they were doing basically at that time

165
00:06:26.876 --> 00:06:29.070
retro-engineering off of the same stuff.

166
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.304
You know, I didn't put the pieces together,

167
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:32.960
frankly, until later.

168
00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:37.548
I went to the Air Force, I spent, next year,

169
00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:39.564
they sent me over to the Far East,

170
00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:41.076
and I was only there for a few months,

171
00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.164
and I wanted, I had some political connections,

172
00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:44.856
and I wanted out of the Air Force,

173
00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:47.124
I thought it was a Mickey Mouse organization,

174
00:06:47.124 --> 00:06:48.852
and I wanted to go to School of Mines anyway.

175
00:06:48.852 --> 00:06:49.840
<v Voiceover>Yeah, you're a kid.</v>

176
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.830
<v ->I was a kid, yeah.</v>

177
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Voiceover>It was a fun lark.</v>

178
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.708
<v ->Unfortunately, they promoted me from Washington,</v>

179
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:59.236
and they sent me to Alexi, Mississippi,

180
00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:01.254
where they made electronics instructor out of me.

181
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.880
And I was really mad, because then I wanted out of that.

182
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.618
I became the instructor but didn't have any class,

183
00:07:06.618 --> 00:07:08.238
so they grabbed me and crosstrained me

184
00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:09.930
into nuclear missiles, I became

185
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.126
a guidance technician for the Hound Dog.

186
00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:13.890
All the sudden, the next two years,

187
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.166
that's what I'm playing in, right?

188
00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:17.326
Then I get out and finally go to School of Mines.

189
00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.260
Anyway, I got out into the game

190
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.982
of what I call Monopoly, you know,

191
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.174
real estate, banking, security, you name it, I'm in it.

192
00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:26.358
Anything just to have fun, because of my--

193
00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:28.666
and that's what I look at, it was this huge game.

194
00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:31.576
The world is my oyster, how big can I go,

195
00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:35.138
and young and naïve, and going at it.

196
00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:39.384
And I built a house in Aspen in 1984.

197
00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:41.670
The housekeeper happened to have

198
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.512
this beautiful coffee table book called

199
00:07:43.512 --> 00:07:46.494
UFO: Contact from the Pleiades, incredible color photos.

200
00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:48.014
<v Voiceover>Now there's nothing really else,</v>

201
00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:49.690
and nothing else that happens since your days

202
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.126
in the military until, so from roughly 1960

203
00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:55.528
to 1984, it was kind of you're on with your business life.

204
00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:56.998
<v ->I'm playing my Monopoly game,</v>

205
00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.402
I'm learning everything there is,

206
00:07:58.402 --> 00:08:00.586
as my friends oft saying,

207
00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:02.802
I learned, I was well trained,

208
00:08:02.802 --> 00:08:04.736
is what they said, for what's coming down now.

209
00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:06.582
So anyway, in 84, I'm looking at

210
00:08:06.582 --> 00:08:08.810
these pictures, and I said, "My gosh,

211
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.624
"that's exactly the same thing that I saw at Edwards."

212
00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.790
I mean, I have a picture here, and then the real thing.

213
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.186
I've got to find out why the government

214
00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:18.548
hasn't come forward at this time.

215
00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:19.506
It's been long enough for--

216
00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.102
<v Voiceover>Now, surely you knew the answer.</v>

217
00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:22.908
Were you still naïve at that point?

218
00:08:22.908 --> 00:08:24.924
<v ->Oh, I was still, I just figured that things</v>

219
00:08:24.924 --> 00:08:26.832
were coming out, we didn't know all the little things.

220
00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:28.806
I was too busy making money, frankly.

221
00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:31.034
Anyway, so then I flew down here to Phoenix

222
00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:33.008
and I talked to this couple who was,

223
00:08:33.008 --> 00:08:35.354
you know, investigating a man named Billy Meier

224
00:08:35.354 --> 00:08:37.328
in Switzerland, who claimed to be in contact

225
00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:39.756
with beings from the star system, the Pleiades,

226
00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:41.730
who said that they engineered planet Earth

227
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.208
for 500 million people, engineered,

228
00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:46.938
I like that word because engineering, you know.

229
00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:48.498
I said, "Oh, okay."

230
00:08:48.498 --> 00:08:49.844
<v Voiceover>It has certain implications.</v>

231
00:08:49.844 --> 00:08:50.978
<v ->Well, it does.</v>

232
00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:53.162
Anyway, I flew down, I said,

233
00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:54.926
"Look, what can I do to help you kids?"

234
00:08:54.926 --> 00:08:57.168
And they said, "Well, we need money to publish the books."

235
00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:58.952
And I said, "That's not a problem, I'll tell you what,

236
00:08:58.952 --> 00:09:00.928
"I'll loan you the money to publish the books,

237
00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:02.792
"with the provision, when you sell them,

238
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.120
"I want my money back first."

239
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.676
So that happened,

240
00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:09.588
except for nine days later,

241
00:09:09.588 --> 00:09:11.120
I got the accounting in there,

242
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.968
and they didn't send me a check.

243
00:09:12.968 --> 00:09:14.396
And I said, "Well, where's my money?"

244
00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:16.026
And they said, "Well, you don't need it."

245
00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:18.042
Which was not the way I played the game.

246
00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:19.848
So, anyway, so involved with,

247
00:09:19.848 --> 00:09:21.402
they gave me a lot of information

248
00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:24.208
and shared me the data, the Billy Meier's story,

249
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.770
I flew down, I filed suit against them,

250
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.696
and then my wife and I grabbed

251
00:09:28.696 --> 00:09:31.336
the next plane and flew to Switzerland, unannounced.

252
00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:33.142
Get to Zurich, rent a little car,

253
00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:34.798
went that 45 mile drive out, you know,

254
00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:37.150
45 minutes, basically, out of Zurich.

255
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.252
<v Voiceover>And you popped in on Billy Meier?</v>

256
00:09:39.252 --> 00:09:40.530
<v ->Yeah, unannounced.</v>

257
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.874
Well, I wanted to know.

258
00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:43.596
I mean, I put my money on it,

259
00:09:43.596 --> 00:09:45.396
I had already put $10,000 into the movie being made,

260
00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:47.496
called The Contact, I had that, too,

261
00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:49.258
with Richard George, because,

262
00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:51.234
you know, and Beverly Hills.

263
00:09:51.234 --> 00:09:53.040
Well, anyway, I'm here, knocking on the door,

264
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.798
little Brunei, their name was Brunei,

265
00:09:54.798 --> 00:09:55.780
answers the door, and I said,

266
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.048
"Look, I'm George Green, I put the money up

267
00:09:58.048 --> 00:10:01.114
"for the publishing of your books,

268
00:10:01.114 --> 00:10:03.550
"and I put the money into the movie being made over here,"

269
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.278
and I says, "I've got some questions about Billy."

270
00:10:06.278 --> 00:10:08.440
And they said, her answer was,

271
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.294
"We're not talking to Americans, they're all crooks."

272
00:10:11.294 --> 00:10:12.382
And I said, "What do you mean?"

273
00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:14.020
They said, "Well, they took our information,

274
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.246
"they get all of our stuff, they promise to help us,

275
00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:18.094
"and nothing ever happens."

276
00:10:18.094 --> 00:10:20.362
And I say, "Well, you go back and tell Billy

277
00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:22.126
"what I've done and who I am."

278
00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:24.268
And she came back 10 minutes later, and she says,

279
00:10:24.268 --> 00:10:25.822
"Mr. Green, I'm sorry.

280
00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:28.444
"Shirley McClane was here two months ago,

281
00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:30.922
"and she promised to help us, and nothing has happened."

282
00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.604
And I said, "Well, c'est la vie."

283
00:10:32.604 --> 00:10:33.948
I mean, if I can't see Billy,

284
00:10:33.948 --> 00:10:35.502
I'm not going to waste my time.

285
00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.350
I said, "My wife and I are going to head

286
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.040
"off to Innsbrook tomorrow, then."

287
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.510
It was late in the afternoon, I said,

288
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.982
"Where's the closest hotel?"

289
00:10:41.982 --> 00:10:43.954
I decided to make a vacation out of this deal.

290
00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:45.930
So we went and checked into the hotel.

291
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.492
Next morning, 7 o'clock, here's Brunei.

292
00:10:48.492 --> 00:10:52.096
I said, "Yeah." she saId, "We found out who you are."

293
00:10:52.096 --> 00:10:53.398
And I said, "What do you mean?"

294
00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:55.668
So anyway, she handed me a two page message

295
00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:58.372
from Quetzal, who happened to be the Pleiadian Commander

296
00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:00.094
who was in contact with Billy.

297
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:03.430
Now, that was addressed to me, right?

298
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.372
There was information in there nobody could know.

299
00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:08.042
I mean, you'd have to be sleeping with me

300
00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:11.168
to get that kind of stuff, so we were invited back

301
00:11:11.168 --> 00:11:13.774
to Billy's compound for the next week,

302
00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:17.330
and frankly, everything I thought I knew was a lie.

303
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.154
<v Voiceover>Just talk about it from there.</v>

304
00:11:19.154 --> 00:11:20.472
<v ->Everything from that point on.</v>

305
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.076
<v Voiceover>So it deconstructed your understanding</v>

306
00:11:23.076 --> 00:11:24.758
of what's happening on planet Earth.

307
00:11:24.758 --> 00:11:27.236
<v ->Exactly, it gave me the understanding</v>

308
00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:28.866
that planet Earth

309
00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:32.186
is basically the prison planet.

310
00:11:32.186 --> 00:11:34.286
There's only one race on the planet,

311
00:11:34.286 --> 00:11:35.644
it's called the human race.

312
00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:36.988
We have a lot of different colors,

313
00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.844
in the universe, there's all kinds of size and shapes.

314
00:11:39.844 --> 00:11:42.028
In fact, last time I was over at Billy's,

315
00:11:42.028 --> 00:11:44.266
I went to the neighbor farmer to see

316
00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:46.134
if he had seen anything recently, he took me,

317
00:11:46.134 --> 00:11:48.820
he's excited, he took me over behind his barn,

318
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.500
because he went out to milk the cow,

319
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.754
and there was a guy seven meters tall

320
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.266
leaning against the barn,

321
00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:56.876
Well, of course, I see the footprint, I'm excited,

322
00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:58.426
you know, I run back to Billy, and I say,

323
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.578
"Billy, there's a guy," and he just shrugged his shoulders

324
00:12:00.578 --> 00:12:02.678
and says, "George, come back here."

325
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:03.938
And he took me in the back room,

326
00:12:03.938 --> 00:12:06.164
and he had a little plaster cast of little tiny feet.

327
00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:07.466
He says, "Don't you know the story

328
00:12:07.466 --> 00:12:09.188
"of the leprechauns and faeries?"

329
00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:11.708
Basically, there's all kinds of sizes

330
00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:13.262
and shapes in the universe.

331
00:12:13.262 --> 00:12:15.312
We just happen to be this--

332
00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:16.488
<v Voiceover>A unit species.</v>

333
00:12:16.488 --> 00:12:18.882
<v ->Well, we're the human race at this time.</v>

334
00:12:18.882 --> 00:12:22.596
However, they gave us some history about the planet,

335
00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:24.690
and I had seen to verify this from other sources,

336
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.948
because just because they said it,

337
00:12:25.948 --> 00:12:27.460
doesn't mean it's true, right?

338
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.712
Number one, they say that this planet

339
00:12:30.712 --> 00:12:32.562
was engineered for 500 million people.

340
00:12:32.562 --> 00:12:34.494
Started analyzing why we get so much water,

341
00:12:34.494 --> 00:12:36.846
oxygen, everything, in balance.

342
00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:38.316
So we never had the rulebook.

343
00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:41.802
We had the rulebook which is under the guise of free will

344
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.356
not to do anything about it.

345
00:12:44.506 --> 00:12:47.994
So anyway, reading his data and asking Billy about it,

346
00:12:47.994 --> 00:12:49.564
all the little pieces of the questions

347
00:12:49.564 --> 00:12:53.260
I had in geology, in geophysics, on the planet,

348
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.958
seemed to be answered by the information.

349
00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.570
Like, why was there gold chains in coal seams

350
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.460
in Kentucky, for instance.

351
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.652
How come all these carvings and things

352
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:05.752
that show flying saucers, like in Mexico,

353
00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:07.744
or go to India, and you see all these things

354
00:13:07.744 --> 00:13:10.534
around the planet, Egypt, India, and China,

355
00:13:10.534 --> 00:13:13.006
over in Shehong, where the terracotta figures are.

356
00:13:13.006 --> 00:13:14.224
<v Voiceover>Even aboriginal caves.</v>

357
00:13:14.224 --> 00:13:16.030
<v ->Aborigines the same way.</v>

358
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.962
I actually asked about the aborigines,

359
00:13:17.962 --> 00:13:20.692
but they were the remnants from the last time,

360
00:13:20.692 --> 00:13:23.338
because the planet, remember

361
00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:25.438
we started talking about how we're spinning around,

362
00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:28.084
our solar system is going around

363
00:13:28.084 --> 00:13:30.856
the central sun of the Pleiades called Halcyon,

364
00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:33.838
and it cycles approximately every 26,000 years.

365
00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:37.870
Well, we're ending the cycle, about the year 2012.

366
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.608
Timing is, what, not so many it's more or less,

367
00:13:41.608 --> 00:13:43.162
but because of where we're at,

368
00:13:43.162 --> 00:13:44.842
but it appears we're going there.

369
00:13:44.842 --> 00:13:48.538
Now, there are energy streams within the universe,

370
00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:52.586
and these energy streams are also hitting the planet.

371
00:13:52.586 --> 00:13:55.066
They call it the photon belt, the monasic ring,

372
00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:58.804
and it also coincides with also the year 2012,

373
00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:00.820
or again, an approximation of it.

374
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.264
So these energy streams, plus what we're doing to the planet

375
00:14:04.264 --> 00:14:06.128
is making the end beginning,

376
00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:08.482
so when we go into, quote, the new age,

377
00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:11.338
the Aquarian age, what is going to be left?

378
00:14:11.338 --> 00:14:15.030
Well, if the planet was engineered for 500 million people

379
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.762
and the guys I used to run around with

380
00:14:17.762 --> 00:14:20.616
have got the goal to reduce it down to 500 million--

381
00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:21.594
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

382
00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.148
Whered they get that info?

383
00:14:23.148 --> 00:14:25.274
<v ->They got it from the same places.</v>

384
00:14:25.274 --> 00:14:26.696
Then I started asking questions, they said,

385
00:14:26.696 --> 00:14:28.376
"Wait a minute, let's bring this up

386
00:14:28.376 --> 00:14:30.308
"to what the big picture's all about."

387
00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:32.534
They know that the planet, to stay in balance,

388
00:14:32.534 --> 00:14:34.298
has to be 500 million.

389
00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:37.114
If I was an engineer, I wouldn't have that many people.

390
00:14:37.114 --> 00:14:40.010
So they're going to reduce it far less than that.

391
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.992
But that was their goal, that they wanted to put out,

392
00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:46.186
so 90-some percent of the world's population

393
00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:48.194
be brought down to that figure.

394
00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:49.534
<v Voiceover>When did we pass</v>

395
00:14:49.534 --> 00:14:51.214
the half a billion mark?

396
00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:53.104
<v ->The six billion, 300 million?</v>

397
00:14:54.374 --> 00:14:55.434
500 million?

398
00:14:55.434 --> 00:14:56.778
<v Voiceover>Yeah, how long ago</v>

399
00:14:56.778 --> 00:14:58.208
has that been since we passed that, do you know?

400
00:14:58.208 --> 00:15:01.936
<v ->Well, we had two billion people on the planet about 1900,</v>

401
00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:05.706
and that was right after that that the--

402
00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:09.458
are you familiar with what happened in 1904?

403
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.640
<v Voiceover>Which, what?</v>

404
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.348
<v ->Well, in 1904, Colonel Francis Younghusband,</v>

405
00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:18.500
he was a British officer, led a team to Tibet.

406
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.480
The Tibetan monks were guarding the ancient documents

407
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.130
of Atlantis among others,

408
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.076
in the documents, it showed that the planet

409
00:15:25.076 --> 00:15:27.048
was engineered for 500 million people

410
00:15:27.048 --> 00:15:30.156
and was going to flip on its axis about the year 2012.

411
00:15:30.156 --> 00:15:33.056
Now, that information was given to his boss,

412
00:15:33.056 --> 00:15:36.332
which was Lord Curzon, who was the viceroy of India.

413
00:15:36.332 --> 00:15:39.068
India was controlled by the center of the universe,

414
00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:41.100
at that time, which was London, right?

415
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.654
Okay, well, two billion people,

416
00:15:42.654 --> 00:15:44.754
the scientists looked at the data and they said,

417
00:15:44.754 --> 00:15:46.812
"Oh, my gosh, this is all,

418
00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.954
"we're four times the carrying capacity

419
00:15:48.954 --> 00:15:50.760
"right now, with two billion people."

420
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.158
That's what their research said,

421
00:15:52.158 --> 00:15:54.636
so they put together their own little group,

422
00:15:54.636 --> 00:15:58.176
under Bismarck, the German scientist,

423
00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:02.478
the Germans were given the nuclear technology was in there.

424
00:16:02.478 --> 00:16:06.554
And so they led an expedition to Tunguska, Siberia,

425
00:16:06.554 --> 00:16:10.626
launched by a missile, the first nuclear explosion,

426
00:16:10.626 --> 00:16:14.198
the purpose was to flip the planet on its axis prematurely,

427
00:16:14.198 --> 00:16:17.346
because 90% of the world's population was next to the ocean.

428
00:16:17.346 --> 00:16:19.164
If the planet flips, we're going to get rid

429
00:16:19.164 --> 00:16:20.478
of a lot of people naturally, right?

430
00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:21.908
So they were trying to play God.

431
00:16:21.908 --> 00:16:23.420
Now wait, let's go the next step.

432
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.452
How do you know that the Germans had that technology?

433
00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:30.068
Because there's radiation, and I have

434
00:16:30.068 --> 00:16:32.380
all the videos of people that were alive,

435
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.554
interviews with them, they were alive at the time,

436
00:16:35.554 --> 00:16:38.370
they saw the missile going up, and the radiation detector,

437
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.722
they don't talk about that right now, in Tunguska,

438
00:16:40.722 --> 00:16:42.656
they claim that a meteor hit it.

439
00:16:42.656 --> 00:16:43.718
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

440
00:16:43.718 --> 00:16:45.776
<v ->Okay, now, at the end of World War Two,</v>

441
00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:48.170
we took out the nuclear submarine,

442
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.648
right out of the chute, right?

443
00:16:50.648 --> 00:16:52.580
The Soviets got the nuclear scientists,

444
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.850
we got them, and unfortunately,

445
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.074
Hitler already had two nuclear bombs

446
00:16:57.074 --> 00:16:59.510
and they were called the Fatman,

447
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.462
which we took on dropped on Japan.

448
00:17:02.462 --> 00:17:04.856
So now you know how, and I've got all the documentation,

449
00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:06.620
we're putting that together right now,

450
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.480
so people can see it for themselves.

451
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.496
We've been led down the primrose path.

452
00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:13.604
Hitler had flying saucers, those two bombs

453
00:17:13.604 --> 00:17:16.138
were targeted to hit New York City

454
00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:18.404
and Washington DC, by Hitler.

455
00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.348
And he didn't die, by the way.

456
00:17:20.348 --> 00:17:21.452
<v Voiceover>I've heard that.</v>

457
00:17:21.452 --> 00:17:23.324
<v ->And all of his data, too.</v>

458
00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:25.048
No, he ended up in South America.

459
00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:27.274
<v Voiceover>Also, I read somewhere along the way,</v>

460
00:17:27.274 --> 00:17:29.162
I read all this, like you, so many things,

461
00:17:29.162 --> 00:17:32.272
that the Germans had had a very similar event

462
00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:35.646
to Roswell, only previously to that, previous to that.

463
00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:38.420
So they had actually back-engineered a lot of technology,

464
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.728
prior, and that's where we got Project Paperclip

465
00:17:40.728 --> 00:17:42.432
and the Germans coming after the war--

466
00:17:42.432 --> 00:17:43.954
<v ->Well, Paperclip was involved with</v>

467
00:17:43.954 --> 00:17:47.464
the agreements that we got Werhner Von Braun,

468
00:17:47.464 --> 00:17:49.942
who was like third down in the chain,

469
00:17:49.942 --> 00:17:51.874
number one in the chain went to Russia.

470
00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:56.954
Under Paperclip, we also got the Japanese

471
00:17:56.954 --> 00:17:59.812
biological engineer that was killing everybody

472
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.288
with biologicals in Manchuria,

473
00:18:02.288 --> 00:18:05.186
we gave him citizenship and put him in charge Fort Dietrich,

474
00:18:05.186 --> 00:18:06.818
these are all part of the game.

475
00:18:06.818 --> 00:18:09.132
I mean, this was all part of the much bigger picture,

476
00:18:09.132 --> 00:18:11.776
the people behind the scenes are aware of all the data,

477
00:18:11.776 --> 00:18:15.222
and they love, like Al Gore putting out his movie right now,

478
00:18:15.222 --> 00:18:17.320
to tell the people that the whole planet's in trouble,

479
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.464
so what they're going to do is expedite it,

480
00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:21.268
we've got to have somebody to blame.

481
00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:24.642
Okay, the Old Testament blames God, God kills everybody.

482
00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:26.038
Isn't that right?

483
00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.164
So we've got to have something out here,

484
00:18:28.164 --> 00:18:29.428
somebody's going to come save us.

485
00:18:29.428 --> 00:18:31.370
They won't take on the responsibility for it.

486
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.068
Well, back to the story again, we're getting ready for this.

487
00:18:35.068 --> 00:18:37.428
Now, the Global 2000, they want to have

488
00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:40.496
their plan theta complete by the year 2012.

489
00:18:40.496 --> 00:18:43.910
That's only six years, so all of our dreams that we have

490
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.430
to put together are getting very limited.

491
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.550
Will it be the 2012, well, they didn't make the 2000.

492
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.902
So it maybe go a little bit longer than that,

493
00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:53.310
but we've got an environment problem.

494
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.952
<v Voiceover>Can you just give us some more about,</v>

495
00:18:54.952 --> 00:18:56.136
besides the population reduction,

496
00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.364
some of the other highlights in the Global 2000.

497
00:18:58.364 --> 00:19:01.770
<v ->Well, it basically ends up with a small group</v>

498
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.788
of people in control of the entire planet.

499
00:19:03.788 --> 00:19:07.314
Their goal is to have, quote, the one world order,

500
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.456
if you want to call it that, controlling.

501
00:19:09.456 --> 00:19:11.222
And those people are buying, we don't know

502
00:19:11.222 --> 00:19:13.322
who's going to be it, because they buy from each other.

503
00:19:13.322 --> 00:19:15.128
I mean, I sat down at a meeting with a dozen people,

504
00:19:15.128 --> 00:19:17.732
we're discussing reducing the world's population,

505
00:19:17.732 --> 00:19:20.672
and have of us adjourn to another room,

506
00:19:20.672 --> 00:19:22.058
we got to talking about getting rid

507
00:19:22.058 --> 00:19:24.074
of some of the ones that were just in the other room.

508
00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:25.544
<v Voiceover>Well, that would make total sense.</v>

509
00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:27.536
If you're in a fear-based mentality,

510
00:19:27.536 --> 00:19:29.048
then it stops at nothing.

511
00:19:29.048 --> 00:19:31.922
<v ->I equate it with being in a den of rattlesnakes,</v>

512
00:19:31.922 --> 00:19:33.854
black widows, and scorpions.

513
00:19:33.854 --> 00:19:35.492
They're all capable of killing each other,

514
00:19:35.492 --> 00:19:37.592
the question is who's going to end up on top.

515
00:19:37.592 --> 00:19:39.356
And they're all playing for buying it,

516
00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:42.230
the problem is, it becomes too much bigger picture,

517
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.036
they're all being manipulated from,

518
00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:46.010
at some point, from the extraterrestrials.

519
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.522
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that.</v>

520
00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:50.796
This is something that is very,

521
00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:52.782
very confusing,

522
00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:56.018
because my understanding,

523
00:19:56.018 --> 00:19:59.732
there are beings from so many different places

524
00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.168
that are affecting what goes on on Earth,

525
00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:04.310
and there are those also who are,

526
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.090
conversely, trying to assist in the guidance

527
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.426
for the population, and so, it seems as though

528
00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:13.106
you have as many different agendas

529
00:20:13.106 --> 00:20:14.660
coming from other places as you do

530
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.264
from going on here on planet Earth itself.

531
00:20:17.264 --> 00:20:19.046
<v ->Ah, you hit the problem.</v>

532
00:20:19.046 --> 00:20:21.902
There's a much bigger agenda that's going on.

533
00:20:21.902 --> 00:20:24.842
We have the agenda from the guys that are in control

534
00:20:24.842 --> 00:20:28.664
of this planet on the physical plane we call planet Earth,

535
00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:31.562
we have an agenda, a much bigger agenda,

536
00:20:31.562 --> 00:20:34.830
where there's a group of extraterrestrials,

537
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.820
on another level, that are hoping we destroy ourselves,

538
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.342
they want to create another universe using our soul energy.

539
00:20:45.542 --> 00:20:47.594
<v Voiceover>So if we get rid</v>

540
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.694
of the third-dimensional aspect,

541
00:20:49.694 --> 00:20:51.500
you have a lot of displaced souls?

542
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.710
<v ->Yeah, there's 21 grams, only a soul weight.</v>

543
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.222
<v Voiceover>Yeah, but still, there's a lot</v>

544
00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:58.406
of knowledge in those souls, it's not just plasma.

545
00:20:58.406 --> 00:21:02.018
<v ->And energy, remember, everything is a product.</v>

546
00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:03.968
You know, in John 1, Biblically speaking,

547
00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:05.490
it says, "In the beginning was the Word,"

548
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.230
and I tell people that wasn't a correct translation.

549
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.086
"In the beginning was thought," words are just--

550
00:21:10.086 --> 00:21:12.396
<v Voiceover>Right, and everything here is a thought form.</v>

551
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.742
So it's all been created from thought.

552
00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:17.262
<v ->Condensed thought, vibration,</v>

553
00:21:17.262 --> 00:21:19.320
and so if thought can,

554
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.252
with the ability of free will,

555
00:21:21.252 --> 00:21:24.320
get to a point of ego, and I look at it, the gratification,

556
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.420
and you move over to next dimension,

557
00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.310
doesn't mean you're any better off.

558
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.948
It's just that you don't have this

559
00:21:29.948 --> 00:21:31.754
puppet that you're controlling, right?

560
00:21:31.754 --> 00:21:34.610
What if the energies, and I've contemplated the same thing,

561
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.406
the energies there have so connected,

562
00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:42.392
they call it the cesspool, has got so bad,

563
00:21:42.392 --> 00:21:44.996
it wants to continue on itself, say,

564
00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:47.474
"Hey, I don't need what created me."

565
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.860
And that's what we're involved

566
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.792
with right now, another level.

567
00:21:50.792 --> 00:21:53.312
When I became in contact with the Pleiadians,

568
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.920
with Billy Meier in Switzerland,

569
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.076
there were some things that were going on,

570
00:21:58.076 --> 00:22:00.344
I was not aware of, I mean, you have to live the experience,

571
00:22:00.344 --> 00:22:01.592
that can happen.

572
00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:04.952
They basically said that they're in a constant state

573
00:22:04.952 --> 00:22:06.968
of communion with spirit,

574
00:22:06.968 --> 00:22:08.430
in other words, with the other side.

575
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.776
Well, we all should be there.

576
00:22:09.776 --> 00:22:11.708
I mean people, when they put out prayer,

577
00:22:11.708 --> 00:22:14.228
they're asking for to get back information.

578
00:22:14.228 --> 00:22:16.302
Well, the problem is that we've been

579
00:22:16.302 --> 00:22:19.160
so deprogrammed, as you said before,

580
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.722
and basically dumbed down,

581
00:22:21.722 --> 00:22:25.124
by the educational system, the religious system,

582
00:22:25.124 --> 00:22:27.476
all of these things, anything to do

583
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:29.660
with controlling the way you think.

584
00:22:31.038 --> 00:22:32.846
Including, to the point of putting

585
00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:35.366
thought into your head without you knowing it.

586
00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:37.746
<v Voiceover>On many different levels,</v>

587
00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:39.720
the media is only part of it.

588
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.610
<v ->Now, how do we trigger that mind</v>

589
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.208
to get back into the understanding

590
00:22:43.208 --> 00:22:45.770
that we are an extension of the creation?

591
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.878
And who I got involved with at the very end

592
00:22:48.878 --> 00:22:50.448
was at that creational level, he says,

593
00:22:50.448 --> 00:22:53.474
"Wait a minute, this is our game in the first place.

594
00:22:53.474 --> 00:22:56.052
"They've got a bunch of them over here

595
00:22:56.052 --> 00:22:58.152
"that are trying to do it, why don't you guys wake up

596
00:22:58.152 --> 00:23:00.672
"and then we can draw on all there is,

597
00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:02.184
"the energy in the universe,

598
00:23:02.184 --> 00:23:03.948
"to change the ending of the story."

599
00:23:03.948 --> 00:23:05.838
<v Voiceover>And those are the ones I'm talking about.</v>

600
00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:07.452
<v ->That's the one I'm involved with right now,</v>

601
00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:09.048
but they're not going to do it for us,

602
00:23:09.048 --> 00:23:10.770
but they'll give us information.

603
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.366
<v Voiceover>But, see, the frustrating part,</v>

604
00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:13.962
now, I get animated in this part,

605
00:23:13.962 --> 00:23:17.232
is that here we have

606
00:23:17.232 --> 00:23:21.828
other types of beings, if you listen to David Icke,

607
00:23:21.828 --> 00:23:23.988
he has his version of it, if you listen to other people

608
00:23:23.988 --> 00:23:25.878
on our site, they have their version of it,

609
00:23:25.878 --> 00:23:29.844
of who the beings are, the Draconians, or whoever they are,

610
00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:34.170
that are perhaps, don't have the same ethics,

611
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.286
that can literally interfere with the species,

612
00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:40.722
and then you have the beings who,

613
00:23:40.722 --> 00:23:44.040
by sheer ethics and virtue of the level

614
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.602
of understanding they have, are not allowed to interfere.

615
00:23:46.602 --> 00:23:49.206
<v ->Well, they are allowed, to a point.</v>

616
00:23:49.206 --> 00:23:52.020
The four basic laws of the universe,

617
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.372
and I'll just basically tell you,

618
00:23:54.372 --> 00:23:56.178
the first one is the law of attraction.

619
00:23:56.178 --> 00:23:57.858
It's basically what Christ said,

620
00:23:57.858 --> 00:24:01.044
"What you put out, you're going to get back," right?

621
00:24:01.044 --> 00:24:02.724
That's what it amounts to.

622
00:24:02.724 --> 00:24:05.286
Okay, the second law is the law of intent.

623
00:24:05.286 --> 00:24:08.352
What did you intend for the action you that you put out?

624
00:24:08.352 --> 00:24:10.872
The next law is the law of allowance.

625
00:24:10.872 --> 00:24:12.468
You have to allow that thought

626
00:24:12.468 --> 00:24:15.324
to be made manifest at whatever level, right?

627
00:24:16.494 --> 00:24:18.576
What's the final one?

628
00:24:18.576 --> 00:24:20.160
Balance.

629
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.794
Where is planet Earth?

630
00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:25.242
<v Voiceover>Out of balance, severely out of balance.</v>

631
00:24:25.242 --> 00:24:27.090
<v ->Now, the question is, how do you do</v>

632
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.898
all the corrections to bring everything,

633
00:24:28.898 --> 00:24:30.746
planet Earth, back into balance

634
00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:33.560
since it's all upside down, and now we have

635
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.366
to take into the next consideration, time.

636
00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:39.896
Time does not exist on the next dimensions,

637
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:42.374
we're the only one, as the old saying is,

638
00:24:42.374 --> 00:24:45.584
"Have patience, but I want it now."

639
00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.852
<v Voiceover>And yet we have the ability</v>

640
00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:49.868
to literally, with our own intention,

641
00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:51.986
collapse the time-space continuum.

642
00:24:51.986 --> 00:24:54.044
<v ->Exactly, but we have the other problem,</v>

643
00:24:54.044 --> 00:24:55.976
and we've bought into this environment,

644
00:24:55.976 --> 00:24:57.950
or this game and this play,

645
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.386
and we have to do what's highest and best good

646
00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:02.108
for mankind, as I tell people.

647
00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:03.452
The next thing is,

648
00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:06.308
we have to reflect back to all

649
00:25:06.308 --> 00:25:08.870
of the so-called laws that we had,

650
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.692
or rule book, and see how phony it is.

651
00:25:12.692 --> 00:25:15.146
You know, like, they tell the kids

652
00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:17.036
in school, "Thou shall not kill."

653
00:25:17.036 --> 00:25:18.582
The real one is, "Thou shall not murder

654
00:25:18.582 --> 00:25:21.102
"thy fellow man in thought or deed,"

655
00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:23.598
because what you thought is manifest.

656
00:25:23.598 --> 00:25:26.204
And what are they doing with little kids today in school?

657
00:25:26.204 --> 00:25:27.816
<v Voiceover>After putting them</v>

658
00:25:27.816 --> 00:25:30.168
on basically cocaine, Ritalin.

659
00:25:31.428 --> 00:25:33.546
<v ->No, they're all talking about,</v>

660
00:25:33.546 --> 00:25:35.478
all the kids are going on highs now,

661
00:25:35.478 --> 00:25:38.292
now with all the cold medicines,

662
00:25:38.292 --> 00:25:40.140
and all the kind of stuff, what do they do?

663
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.946
They sell them all these little war games.

664
00:25:41.946 --> 00:25:45.306
All these war games, all computerized to do what?

665
00:25:45.306 --> 00:25:47.070
<v Voiceover>So killing becomes impersonal.</v>

666
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.220
<v ->Exactly, they don't want to go back to that soul level,</v>

667
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.298
where's the temple located: within.

668
00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:54.626
Remember, this is a puppet controlled by the soul,

669
00:25:54.626 --> 00:25:57.482
but we forgot, we're not connected with the soul

670
00:25:57.482 --> 00:25:59.498
which we should be on a constant basis,

671
00:25:59.498 --> 00:26:02.312
which in turn is connected to the creation,

672
00:26:02.312 --> 00:26:05.372
with the exception of clones, they don't have souls.

673
00:26:05.372 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

674
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.996
<v ->And the process of making clones is pretty--</v>

675
00:26:09.996 --> 00:26:12.522
I mean, I talked to some of the doctors that make them.

676
00:26:12.522 --> 00:26:14.988
We have our method, the Soviets have,

677
00:26:14.988 --> 00:26:16.680
their countries make people.

678
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.654
<v Voiceover>Well, and there's a precedent for it,</v>

679
00:26:18.654 --> 00:26:20.796
a number of people would say,

680
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:23.082
we're a clone species in a sense, not a clone--

681
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:25.476
<v ->Engineered is a better word,</v>

682
00:26:25.476 --> 00:26:27.492
we were engineered to have a limited life,

683
00:26:27.492 --> 00:26:29.214
we were engineered as warriors.

684
00:26:29.214 --> 00:26:31.692
That's the reason why there's so much fighting on.

685
00:26:31.692 --> 00:26:33.372
Remember that in the Pleiades,

686
00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:34.800
they explain it this way:

687
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.992
there was a planet where you had all the people,

688
00:26:37.992 --> 00:26:39.716
everything was in balance, you could go out

689
00:26:39.716 --> 00:26:41.984
and raise your garden, have beautiful flowers,

690
00:26:41.984 --> 00:26:43.496
and you could be a painting,

691
00:26:43.496 --> 00:26:46.436
all of the expressions of creation, you could do

692
00:26:46.436 --> 00:26:48.158
without being hurt,

693
00:26:48.158 --> 00:26:50.510
understanding and respecting the planet

694
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.316
that you were on for doing that.

695
00:26:52.316 --> 00:26:54.290
However, in the universe, it's a big universe,

696
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.844
lots of things going on out here,

697
00:26:55.844 --> 00:26:58.364
thousands of planets inhabited, actually billions,

698
00:26:58.364 --> 00:27:00.632
that are inhabited with humanoids.

699
00:27:00.632 --> 00:27:02.396
They found this nice little planet

700
00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:05.336
and some other extraterrestrials starting attack them.

701
00:27:05.336 --> 00:27:07.688
Well, one of the rules in the universe, remember,

702
00:27:07.688 --> 00:27:11.208
I just told you, "Thou shall not murder thy fellow man."

703
00:27:11.208 --> 00:27:13.352
but you've got to defend yourself.

704
00:27:13.352 --> 00:27:15.620
If you don't defend yourself, that's self-murder,

705
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.040
or suicide. however you view that,

706
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.510
and that's a no-no.

707
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.080
So their solution was, kind of like what's going on,

708
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.120
look around for less developed humanoids

709
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.348
on the evolutionary scale, because evolution

710
00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:31.364
does work, it's just timing.

711
00:27:31.364 --> 00:27:34.430
They re-engineered them, on their DNA,

712
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.244
to give them limited life and intelligence

713
00:27:37.244 --> 00:27:39.428
to act as their lawyer, thinking that

714
00:27:39.428 --> 00:27:41.738
they could get away with those four laws again.

715
00:27:41.738 --> 00:27:44.552
Well, what they created worked for a while.

716
00:27:44.552 --> 00:27:46.434
They could do all the fighting and everything else.

717
00:27:46.434 --> 00:27:48.828
I mean, that's kind of like the Majestic Corps program,

718
00:27:48.828 --> 00:27:50.214
you're familiar with that.

719
00:27:50.214 --> 00:27:52.316
You know, ultimately, the one world order

720
00:27:52.316 --> 00:27:55.004
wants to get, we always have this conflict resolution,

721
00:27:55.004 --> 00:27:56.852
we have to have an enemy, right?

722
00:27:56.852 --> 00:27:58.994
Ultimately, when it got everybody all rounded up,

723
00:27:58.994 --> 00:28:00.884
whatever is left, now it's gonna be

724
00:28:00.884 --> 00:28:02.522
they're coming in from space.

725
00:28:02.522 --> 00:28:04.580
So it follows right along with the same rules,

726
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.126
you just have to understand the game.

727
00:28:06.126 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Voiceover>And it's been engineered,</v>

728
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.990
Hollywood has been in compliance with this

729
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.384
for a number of years, to start creating fear,

730
00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:14.778
as to anything that comes from the outside,

731
00:28:14.778 --> 00:28:16.920
any off-planet species as Carol Rosin

732
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.726
and Albert Wagner would call them.

733
00:28:18.726 --> 00:28:21.710
<v ->Or make it so you don't know what to believe,</v>

734
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.768
so they give you all kinds of different things,

735
00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.196
and then you go back to sleep,

736
00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:27.044
or go down to your local church,

737
00:28:27.044 --> 00:28:29.522
and there's probably a hundred of them in your town,

738
00:28:29.522 --> 00:28:31.244
a hundred different belief systems.

739
00:28:31.244 --> 00:28:32.354
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

740
00:28:32.354 --> 00:28:33.698
So we're,

741
00:28:34.968 --> 00:28:37.286
let's continue on, then, so,

742
00:28:37.286 --> 00:28:39.722
what about right now, what's happening right now?

743
00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:41.436
What kind of beings

744
00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:44.210
are staging their game here right now?

745
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.730
<v ->Well, they're all, we're being focused, big time.</v>

746
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.226
I mean, you have a TV camera on me right now.

747
00:28:50.226 --> 00:28:52.622
Would you believe that we have all kinds of TV cameras

748
00:28:52.622 --> 00:28:54.948
being focused on us from our buddies in space?

749
00:28:54.948 --> 00:28:55.956
<v Voiceover>Oh, absolutely.</v>

750
00:28:55.956 --> 00:28:57.932
<v ->Look around at the stars that are strobing red,</v>

751
00:28:57.932 --> 00:28:59.334
blue, and green, now think about that.

752
00:28:59.334 --> 00:29:00.888
Those are not stars.

753
00:29:00.888 --> 00:29:02.568
<v Voiceover>Okay, yeah, I see them.</v>

754
00:29:02.568 --> 00:29:03.536
<v ->They're spacecraft.</v>

755
00:29:03.536 --> 00:29:05.634
They're sitting here watching to see

756
00:29:05.634 --> 00:29:07.566
what we do to pull out the planet.

757
00:29:07.566 --> 00:29:09.500
We're the big game in the universe right now.

758
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.610
<v Voiceover>I totally agree with that,</v>

759
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.920
and I want to see how it's going to turn out.

760
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.878
<v ->Well, we, you and I,</v>

761
00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:19.358
and you, and your listeners,

762
00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:21.164
and the people that are watching right now,

763
00:29:21.164 --> 00:29:25.164
they're 100% responsible for what's gonna happen.

764
00:29:25.164 --> 00:29:27.092
You can say, "No, I'm going to be--"

765
00:29:27.092 --> 00:29:29.656
If you say no, you're gonna be responsible.

766
00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:33.058
So what the first rule again, gain all knowledge.

767
00:29:33.058 --> 00:29:34.922
See whether or not I'm telling you

768
00:29:34.922 --> 00:29:36.728
just a little bit of the truth.

769
00:29:36.728 --> 00:29:39.332
If it rings to you on the inside, you're going to know.

770
00:29:39.332 --> 00:29:42.356
And now where's that last little game,

771
00:29:42.356 --> 00:29:45.590
responsibility, and that's two words:

772
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.624
the ability to respond.

773
00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:50.708
And then the responsibility, it's like reading

774
00:29:50.708 --> 00:29:52.766
the little handbook that I give away to your listeners.

775
00:29:52.766 --> 00:29:54.782
When they read the book and understand that,

776
00:29:54.782 --> 00:29:57.008
now they're part of the solution.

777
00:29:57.008 --> 00:30:01.136
And the solution is not from our understanding,

778
00:30:01.136 --> 00:30:05.254
it's gonna be from the creational level acting through us,

779
00:30:05.254 --> 00:30:07.060
because that's all energy.

780
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.496
The creation will give us the information

781
00:30:09.496 --> 00:30:13.612
on how to traverse this situation we have right now.

782
00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:15.134
The play hasn't been played out yet.

783
00:30:15.134 --> 00:30:17.318
<v Voiceover>No, it hasn't, and, in fact, most everybody,</v>

784
00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:20.260
I don't usually ask this on camera,

785
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.402
most everybody I've interviewed, I say,

786
00:30:22.402 --> 00:30:24.292
"So how do you think it's all going to go down?"

787
00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:25.888
Just to see what their opinions are,

788
00:30:25.888 --> 00:30:28.240
and, you know, to a person, they all say,

789
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.928
"I couldn't even begin to guess."

790
00:30:30.928 --> 00:30:32.314
No matter who their contacts are,

791
00:30:32.314 --> 00:30:34.372
because we haven't created the ending yet.

792
00:30:34.372 --> 00:30:36.010
This is so true, I think it's so important

793
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.740
for people to know not to become disheartened,

794
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.714
or to give, this is a bad time to give up.

795
00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:42.478
<v ->Well, the last messages that I got</v>

796
00:30:42.478 --> 00:30:45.098
from the guides, if you want to call it that,

797
00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:46.570
that I'm receiving information from,

798
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.300
they say at this point there are too few

799
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.484
to make any substantial difference

800
00:30:51.484 --> 00:30:53.878
to the ending or the outcome of what's planned,

801
00:30:53.878 --> 00:30:56.860
and their urging is to get together with other people,

802
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.884
again, with like minds, to be able to at least

803
00:30:59.884 --> 00:31:03.580
have a remnant, and there's a possibility it may not happen.

804
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.554
And there's a possibility that we may start

805
00:31:05.554 --> 00:31:07.822
a nuclear chain reaction and they're prepared

806
00:31:07.822 --> 00:31:11.350
to encapsulate the planet and make another sun out of it.

807
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.486
Nuclear energy is a no-no, if you notice,

808
00:31:14.486 --> 00:31:17.050
because it'll disrupt the soul energy.

809
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:20.326
<v Voiceover>Exactly, it's not allowed out in any...</v>

810
00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:22.678
I have understood for many years, it's been

811
00:31:22.678 --> 00:31:25.828
very distressing, we've been playing with this here,

812
00:31:25.828 --> 00:31:27.298
especially when we start shooting

813
00:31:27.298 --> 00:31:28.894
it into the outer atmosphere.

814
00:31:28.894 --> 00:31:30.406
It's not allowed.

815
00:31:30.406 --> 00:31:32.086
<v ->Remember, it's vibration.</v>

816
00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:34.774
And it's condensed vibration expanding,

817
00:31:34.774 --> 00:31:37.714
and it vibrates, it ripples through the whole universe,

818
00:31:37.714 --> 00:31:41.032
you can't sit down and say, "Hey, just only right here.'

819
00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:45.458
It's like I published with Cathie's books, The Energy Grid,

820
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:49.112
and Bruce and I had a conversation exactly on that,

821
00:31:49.112 --> 00:31:51.464
he said that they can only explode nuclear bombs

822
00:31:51.464 --> 00:31:53.942
at certain grid points, that's not true.

823
00:31:53.942 --> 00:31:56.000
They have harmonics on anything.

824
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.352
You can set it anywhere you want to,

825
00:31:58.352 --> 00:31:59.696
to set the thing off.

826
00:31:59.696 --> 00:32:03.596
So they can put them on, if they do do that,

827
00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:06.368
why, you think Bush and all the rest of them

828
00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:09.140
are talking about having no nukes in Iran?

829
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.568
Actually it's all energy source,

830
00:32:10.568 --> 00:32:12.248
Iran wants to keep their energy going,

831
00:32:12.248 --> 00:32:15.230
they want to reprocess the nuclear waste,

832
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.162
Russia's doing that, United States does not

833
00:32:17.162 --> 00:32:19.304
reprocess our nuclear waste.

834
00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:21.128
You know what they're doing in Alamogordo?

835
00:32:21.128 --> 00:32:22.346
This is just last month.

836
00:32:22.346 --> 00:32:24.026
They're starting to burn it again.

837
00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:27.194
What is burned, it doesn't do anything, it just goes,

838
00:32:27.194 --> 00:32:29.504
the radiation is let into space again.

839
00:32:29.504 --> 00:32:33.698
<v Voiceover>Okay, so, let's get a little</v>

840
00:32:33.698 --> 00:32:35.504
take the polls here.

841
00:32:36.514 --> 00:32:39.302
All that we talk, we talked about in our first interview,

842
00:32:39.302 --> 00:32:43.250
having to do with an impending collapse of the economy,

843
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.770
really only a few people win when that happens,

844
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.584
this is not an accident, that all of the beings

845
00:32:48.584 --> 00:32:50.306
that live on this planet at this time

846
00:32:50.306 --> 00:32:52.674
have agreed to this engagement together,

847
00:32:52.674 --> 00:32:54.944
at one, to choose--

848
00:32:54.944 --> 00:32:56.160
<v ->At some level.</v>

849
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.924
<v Voiceover>At some level, on some deep level,</v>

850
00:32:57.924 --> 00:33:00.066
we're all here, and I do believe souls

851
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:01.916
have a choice, whether they incarnate or not,

852
00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:04.058
so if we incarnated now, we all came here

853
00:33:04.058 --> 00:33:05.630
to play some part of this play.

854
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.680
<v ->That's right.</v>

855
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.194
<v Voiceover>And so you have those who</v>

856
00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:10.670
are the puppet masters, manipulating resources,

857
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.644
manipulating money supplies, which greatly

858
00:33:12.644 --> 00:33:14.366
affects the people on the planet,

859
00:33:14.366 --> 00:33:17.684
the environment, et cetera, you have a lot of people

860
00:33:17.684 --> 00:33:19.072
trying to wake up, even if it hasn't

861
00:33:19.072 --> 00:33:20.838
reached the tipping point yet.

862
00:33:20.838 --> 00:33:22.768
What's this all coming to now?

863
00:33:22.768 --> 00:33:24.112
How do you look at it together

864
00:33:24.112 --> 00:33:26.842
for the people who can hear all of this,

865
00:33:26.842 --> 00:33:29.698
and give some idea of some of what you shared,

866
00:33:29.698 --> 00:33:31.756
when they get your book, they'll be able to read,

867
00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:34.078
but give us some highlights, maybe.

868
00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.890
<v ->Very frankly, very few people,</v>

869
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.654
because they've been dumbed down,

870
00:33:38.654 --> 00:33:40.588
will be able to understand the book.

871
00:33:40.588 --> 00:33:43.358
And they may put it down, and then a year from now,

872
00:33:43.358 --> 00:33:44.638
if we still have a year from now,

873
00:33:44.638 --> 00:33:45.834
I don't know the timing,

874
00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:49.172
they will be activated at some point,

875
00:33:49.172 --> 00:33:50.516
and they're sharing it.

876
00:33:50.516 --> 00:33:51.986
Some of the books that people get,

877
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:54.088
they give them to their youth bookstore,

878
00:33:54.088 --> 00:33:55.600
but somebody else gets them.

879
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.634
The energies are going someplace.

880
00:33:58.634 --> 00:34:01.700
I'm recognizing that I use my assets

881
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.388
to give away a book, I send them around the world.

882
00:34:04.388 --> 00:34:05.624
<v Voiceover>Free.</v>

883
00:34:05.624 --> 00:34:08.742
Just like we're doing CMN free for the same reason.

884
00:34:08.742 --> 00:34:11.430
<v ->Well, it was a discussion I had with the ETs,</v>

885
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:13.184
it's the same position, why do I do it free?

886
00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:14.948
Well, because the first, if I would sell the book,

887
00:34:14.948 --> 00:34:16.208
what's the first thing people are going to say?

888
00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:17.386
Well, I'm making money on it.

889
00:34:17.386 --> 00:34:20.072
I even pay the postage, so where's the money into it?

890
00:34:20.072 --> 00:34:21.626
<v Voiceover>So they can see that,</v>

891
00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:24.608
and also it prohibits people from taking action.

892
00:34:26.258 --> 00:34:28.020
Anytime you whip out your credit card,

893
00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.960
people are prohibited from taking that action,

894
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.104
in a lot of cases, people need this information.

895
00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.790
<v ->90% of the people, 90% of the money</v>

896
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.344
in the United States is credit cards.

897
00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:39.066
And it's going around the world.

898
00:34:39.066 --> 00:34:41.840
Now, all credit card charges, outside the United States,

899
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.778
have a 5% charge, did you know that, an additional charge.

900
00:34:44.778 --> 00:34:47.508
So if you go to another country, there's another 5% add-on.

901
00:34:48.578 --> 00:34:49.964
<v Voiceover>So you're doing this</v>

902
00:34:49.964 --> 00:34:52.360
because you know and you've been guided.

903
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.082
<v ->Well, I'm being constantly reminded that</v>

904
00:34:54.082 --> 00:34:56.938
if we don't do that, we're not going to have a planet left.

905
00:34:56.938 --> 00:35:00.216
I don't care what color you are, whatever,

906
00:35:00.216 --> 00:35:02.146
if you're going to be assisting to help,

907
00:35:02.146 --> 00:35:04.372
hey, we need all the help we can get.

908
00:35:04.372 --> 00:35:06.852
You can forget about whatever supposedly--

909
00:35:06.852 --> 00:35:08.634
you know, the biggest problem when I look

910
00:35:08.634 --> 00:35:11.112
at the whole planet is, unfortunately, is religion,

911
00:35:11.112 --> 00:35:13.172
and that's the opiate of the masses.

912
00:35:13.172 --> 00:35:16.068
They don't recognize that information is--

913
00:35:16.068 --> 00:35:17.790
that we're all part of the creation

914
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.522
and there is no, quote, god out there

915
00:35:19.522 --> 00:35:21.622
that's gonna come save it, because the definition

916
00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:23.068
of god becomes something different.

917
00:35:23.068 --> 00:35:25.126
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

918
00:35:25.126 --> 00:35:28.068
So, what can we do for ourselves,

919
00:35:28.068 --> 00:35:30.210
if you can share some of--

920
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.772
let's say that our listeners, our viewers,

921
00:35:32.772 --> 00:35:35.754
are tuned in, dialed in right now,

922
00:35:35.754 --> 00:35:38.274
as they're listening to you, in terms of some

923
00:35:38.274 --> 00:35:39.912
of the information that they can expect

924
00:35:39.912 --> 00:35:41.886
to be reading in this book, that can

925
00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:44.322
help elevate their connection to spirit.

926
00:35:44.322 --> 00:35:46.848
<v ->The book is written in a way,</v>

927
00:35:48.024 --> 00:35:50.418
it's kind of an antivirus device

928
00:35:50.418 --> 00:35:52.856
that you put in your computer, you know,

929
00:35:52.856 --> 00:35:54.870
to get rid of all the garbage,

930
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.886
GIGO, garbage-in-garbage-out,

931
00:35:56.886 --> 00:36:00.080
well, by reading the book two or three times,

932
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.884
all of the sudden, it's kind of like

933
00:36:01.884 --> 00:36:03.900
what you mentioned before, it'll clear up your mind.

934
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.464
Now we have devices that will help balance your mind,

935
00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:10.158
but the programming's there, this is a deprogramming device.

936
00:36:10.158 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Voiceover>Very good, that's what I--</v>

937
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.344
<v ->Deprogramming the way you've been programmed since day--</v>

938
00:36:15.344 --> 00:36:17.780
the school books, for instance, my books that I tried--

939
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.544
I publish a lot of books.

940
00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:21.434
You cannot get them into the schools,

941
00:36:21.434 --> 00:36:23.198
because they have a selection committee,

942
00:36:23.198 --> 00:36:24.794
on what books goes in there.

943
00:36:24.794 --> 00:36:28.912
Barnes &amp; Noble, for instance, and Borders and stuff,

944
00:36:28.912 --> 00:36:32.196
there's a selection committee is the three largest

945
00:36:32.196 --> 00:36:34.758
publishers in New York, that selects the books

946
00:36:34.758 --> 00:36:36.606
that they want to put into the stores,

947
00:36:36.606 --> 00:36:38.496
which is controlled by Ingram,

948
00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:40.092
which is the largest book distributor,

949
00:36:40.092 --> 00:36:42.318
which is owned by Bertelsmann out of Germany.

950
00:36:42.318 --> 00:36:44.420
We no longer have any control over the thought.

951
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.980
Other than 90% of the stories out here

952
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.744
are romance and mystery novels,

953
00:36:48.744 --> 00:36:50.266
and there are some authors that are

954
00:36:50.266 --> 00:36:51.946
putting out incredible information,

955
00:36:51.946 --> 00:36:56.200
quasi-mystery, quasi-that, to give you part of the truth,

956
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.686
and now the question is, how do you discern which is truth,

957
00:36:59.686 --> 00:37:01.954
and now it's up to you to start studying,

958
00:37:01.954 --> 00:37:04.096
ask your friends, getting other people,

959
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.660
getting groups together, small, not big groups.

960
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.928
You know, it even tells you this in the book,

961
00:37:08.928 --> 00:37:11.028
small amounts, less than a dozen.

962
00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:14.104
And now set up actual, some functions,

963
00:37:14.104 --> 00:37:15.826
understanding, because a lot of people

964
00:37:15.826 --> 00:37:17.590
are going to put their head in the sand again

965
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.650
when they find out how much their controls

966
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.252
that are taken care of, and they thought of everything,

967
00:37:22.252 --> 00:37:24.016
including your thought.

968
00:37:24.016 --> 00:37:25.748
<v Voiceover>Yes, and I know about that.</v>

969
00:37:25.748 --> 00:37:27.762
We've interviewed Nick Begich and some others,

970
00:37:27.762 --> 00:37:29.652
so I think most of our viewers

971
00:37:29.652 --> 00:37:31.754
are somewhat aware if not fully aware.

972
00:37:31.754 --> 00:37:32.898
<v ->It's the--</v>

973
00:37:32.898 --> 00:37:35.850
Dr. Begich and I talked about before you guys, you know,

974
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.390
we were discussing his stuff,

975
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.288
and the vibrational medicine and healing

976
00:37:41.288 --> 00:37:42.804
and all that type of material.

977
00:37:42.804 --> 00:37:44.858
We'd run around this planet, seeing what we could do

978
00:37:44.858 --> 00:37:47.506
to bring out, it's like most, you know,

979
00:37:47.506 --> 00:37:49.730
diseases, disease, has set down.

980
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.264
The question is, that most people leave out,

981
00:37:51.264 --> 00:37:53.238
is when did you cause the disease?

982
00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:54.762
<v Voiceover>Right, that's right.</v>

983
00:37:54.762 --> 00:37:57.406
<v ->And you can determine that maybe in a previous lifetime,</v>

984
00:37:57.406 --> 00:37:59.338
that you brought back in that thought level,

985
00:37:59.338 --> 00:38:01.102
and it's got to come back into balance,

986
00:38:01.102 --> 00:38:02.992
once you recognize it, release it.

987
00:38:02.992 --> 00:38:05.828
And you can come back into what we call wholeness.

988
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.416
And the wholeness is being allowed to have,

989
00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:12.012
you've got to feed the temple,

990
00:38:12.012 --> 00:38:13.734
and you've got to feed it in the right way,

991
00:38:13.734 --> 00:38:16.128
and right now, because of the environment,

992
00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:18.018
about everything is polluted.

993
00:38:19.298 --> 00:38:21.136
<v Voiceover>So we have to take responsibility</v>

994
00:38:21.136 --> 00:38:23.792
for our own food source, and that still doesn't,

995
00:38:23.792 --> 00:38:26.220
you're not immune from whatever is coming from above,

996
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.444
and falling onto your crops.

997
00:38:28.444 --> 00:38:31.006
I mean, but nonetheless, you have to do what you can.

998
00:38:31.006 --> 00:38:32.434
<v ->You do what you can.</v>

999
00:38:33.814 --> 00:38:35.594
That's the best thing you can do.

1000
00:38:35.594 --> 00:38:38.870
Again, and how do you maintain an industry

1001
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.188
which is based on the trades that we've had right now?

1002
00:38:42.188 --> 00:38:44.162
I mean, all of the Middle East knows

1003
00:38:44.162 --> 00:38:46.446
that the America has been living on, what?

1004
00:38:46.446 --> 00:38:50.432
Movie stars, football heroes, all this,

1005
00:38:50.432 --> 00:38:52.844
supposedly money, you know, win the lottery,

1006
00:38:52.844 --> 00:38:54.398
go to Vegas, do all this stuff.

1007
00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.912
<v Voiceover>Opiate distractions.</v>

1008
00:38:55.912 --> 00:38:56.876
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1009
00:38:56.876 --> 00:39:00.488
Well, it's kind of reading the protocols

1010
00:39:00.488 --> 00:39:03.180
when you read all them, that's the plan for world takeover.

1011
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.286
So that's what you have to look at.

1012
00:39:05.286 --> 00:39:07.682
<v Voiceover>So we need to get real and start--</v>

1013
00:39:07.682 --> 00:39:09.446
you said this a few times now,

1014
00:39:09.446 --> 00:39:11.544
getting together with likeminded people,

1015
00:39:11.544 --> 00:39:13.590
in small communities and small groups.

1016
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.724
<v ->That's right.</v>

1017
00:39:14.724 --> 00:39:16.502
<v Voiceover>Take care of our physical bodies,</v>

1018
00:39:16.502 --> 00:39:18.346
expand our connection to spirit.

1019
00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:21.886
<v ->That's correct, get connected with spirit.</v>

1020
00:39:21.886 --> 00:39:24.530
We have a book, it's called The Genius Frequency,

1021
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.594
and in it, since everybody's a different frequency,

1022
00:39:28.594 --> 00:39:29.854
the question is how do you,

1023
00:39:29.854 --> 00:39:31.408
they aren't necessarily a genius,

1024
00:39:31.408 --> 00:39:33.172
they just know how to tune in,

1025
00:39:33.172 --> 00:39:35.356
so what we have to do is learn how to do that,

1026
00:39:35.356 --> 00:39:36.868
the book will help.

1027
00:39:36.868 --> 00:39:38.548
It's kind of like the devices you're talking about.

1028
00:39:38.548 --> 00:39:41.782
Anyway we can do, because there's many paths,

1029
00:39:41.782 --> 00:39:44.220
as I say, to enlightenment.

1030
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.412
Now, the question is, how do we get them

1031
00:39:46.412 --> 00:39:49.856
so we get an overview, and the best thing I can tell you

1032
00:39:49.856 --> 00:39:51.704
and your listeners and everybody,

1033
00:39:51.704 --> 00:39:55.466
is remember it's a huge play, stay in the observer mode

1034
00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:58.406
as much as you can, don't be frightened about it,

1035
00:39:58.406 --> 00:39:59.792
this is a transition.

1036
00:39:59.792 --> 00:40:01.598
<v Voiceover>Right, and don't buy into the drama.</v>

1037
00:40:01.598 --> 00:40:04.034
<v ->Well, don't buy, and understand it's a drama.</v>

1038
00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:06.388
And that's spelled out in the book, too.

1039
00:40:06.388 --> 00:40:08.864
Understand that it's a drama, and now the question is:

1040
00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:10.586
how are we going to rewrite the ending

1041
00:40:10.586 --> 00:40:13.946
at this level and don't look at the outlet,

1042
00:40:13.946 --> 00:40:17.014
don't expect an outcome at this point,

1043
00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:19.070
because we don't know what the outcome is,

1044
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.718
because the play is changing every second.

1045
00:40:21.718 --> 00:40:22.902
<v Voiceover>It is.</v>

1046
00:40:22.902 --> 00:40:25.044
<v ->Every second, we're doing something different,</v>

1047
00:40:25.044 --> 00:40:27.480
and maybe somebody else, that, you know,

1048
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.454
they resign, somebody else came in,

1049
00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:31.848
but the players that are playing,

1050
00:40:31.848 --> 00:40:34.074
the ones that we are made aware of,

1051
00:40:34.074 --> 00:40:36.594
it's like, you know, Washington DC, those players,

1052
00:40:36.594 --> 00:40:39.534
that's only the top of the anthill.

1053
00:40:39.534 --> 00:40:42.684
All the anthill underneath has enormous games

1054
00:40:42.684 --> 00:40:44.428
they're playing with the guys up on top,

1055
00:40:44.428 --> 00:40:45.856
and they can't do anything, either.

1056
00:40:45.856 --> 00:40:47.452
<v Voiceover>Right, yeah, they're puppets, too.</v>

1057
00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:48.638
<v ->It's a whole thing.</v>

1058
00:40:48.638 --> 00:40:51.746
<v Voiceover>So the question that comes up a lot</v>

1059
00:40:51.746 --> 00:40:53.572
from a lot of people is:

1060
00:40:53.572 --> 00:40:58.150
can we reach a critical mass of consciousness where--

1061
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.292
this is actually a two-pronged question,

1062
00:41:00.292 --> 00:41:02.938
enough where we ourselves, the human species,

1063
00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:04.534
can actually control the outcome,

1064
00:41:04.534 --> 00:41:06.214
without any help from the outside,

1065
00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:08.986
or do we actually reach a critical mass of consciousness

1066
00:41:08.986 --> 00:41:12.430
where it can basically be perceived as permission

1067
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.162
to receive more help from the outside.

1068
00:41:18.052 --> 00:41:20.318
<v ->The way you worded the question,</v>

1069
00:41:20.318 --> 00:41:23.008
understand that they are allowed to give us,

1070
00:41:23.008 --> 00:41:24.476
when we reach that critical mass,

1071
00:41:24.476 --> 00:41:25.862
we have not reached that point.

1072
00:41:25.862 --> 00:41:27.332
<v Voiceover>That's what I'm saying, but they are--</v>

1073
00:41:27.332 --> 00:41:29.350
<v ->They are observing what they are,</v>

1074
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.406
they are hoping that, at some point,

1075
00:41:31.406 --> 00:41:33.928
we will come to that point, and we will have somebody

1076
00:41:33.928 --> 00:41:36.296
which will be able to ask,

1077
00:41:36.296 --> 00:41:40.794
not as a, "Give me this," not as a victim-type thing,

1078
00:41:40.794 --> 00:41:43.948
that's saying, "We desire your assistance."

1079
00:41:43.948 --> 00:41:46.308
You know, it's a little prayer that we have.

1080
00:41:46.308 --> 00:41:48.996
"I am a human, becoming, help me become."

1081
00:41:48.996 --> 00:41:52.106
That allows them to communicate with you.

1082
00:41:52.106 --> 00:41:54.666
I mean, that's all you have to do, tonight,

1083
00:41:54.666 --> 00:41:56.608
have a little prayer just before you go to bed, say,

1084
00:41:56.608 --> 00:41:59.716
"I'm a human, becoming, help me become."

1085
00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:02.162
That allows them for communication.

1086
00:42:02.162 --> 00:42:04.084
It's an honest thing, there's no victim,

1087
00:42:04.084 --> 00:42:06.688
there's nothing going on, that allows the opening

1088
00:42:06.688 --> 00:42:09.420
with higher energies to communicate with you.

1089
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.778
They give you a little bit more of the story,

1090
00:42:12.778 --> 00:42:14.712
because the more of the story you get,

1091
00:42:14.712 --> 00:42:16.390
the bigger the picture you're going to get,

1092
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:18.700
and at some point, you're going to understand

1093
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.380
a little bit on how creation works.

1094
00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.118
There's a total of three books that are in this series.

1095
00:42:24.118 --> 00:42:25.978
When you get through with those, if you do,

1096
00:42:25.978 --> 00:42:28.538
and very few people don't, they do do it,

1097
00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:32.748
you will get an understanding why we have chaos,

1098
00:42:32.748 --> 00:42:35.436
and out of the chaos, we're going to create

1099
00:42:35.436 --> 00:42:38.586
this new thing, and it's not a question

1100
00:42:38.586 --> 00:42:40.602
of the new world order, what they want,

1101
00:42:40.602 --> 00:42:42.534
because they want to create chaos, too.

1102
00:42:42.534 --> 00:42:45.222
What we want to do is create a new system in balance.

1103
00:42:46.532 --> 00:42:49.096
And then using in the highest of good,

1104
00:42:49.096 --> 00:42:50.944
the best good for mankind.

1105
00:42:52.164 --> 00:42:54.608
Does that sound fair?

1106
00:42:54.608 --> 00:42:56.372
That sounds like a real challenge.

1107
00:42:56.372 --> 00:42:59.458
And that's where I'm at, I'm running around the world,

1108
00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:01.812
trying to awaken people up.

1109
00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:04.078
<v Voiceover>Well, you got my attention,</v>

1110
00:43:04.078 --> 00:43:07.146
and I'm totally on board with you on this one,

1111
00:43:07.146 --> 00:43:09.832
and held a lot of very similar viewpoints,

1112
00:43:09.832 --> 00:43:12.814
in terms of what's coming down and why,

1113
00:43:12.814 --> 00:43:15.922
and really a very beautiful, incredible opportunity

1114
00:43:15.922 --> 00:43:17.728
embedded within all of this.

1115
00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.408
<v ->Oh, and responsibility.</v>

1116
00:43:19.408 --> 00:43:20.962
<v Voiceover>And responsibility, of course.</v>

1117
00:43:20.962 --> 00:43:23.188
<v ->It's an opportunity, but it's a responsibility.</v>

1118
00:43:23.188 --> 00:43:24.828
So you have to understand both of them.

1119
00:43:24.828 --> 00:43:26.536
Once you've joined on, all of a sudden,

1120
00:43:26.536 --> 00:43:28.678
"Uh oh, I'm responsible for the whole world?"

1121
00:43:28.678 --> 00:43:31.502
You're not, we're all together are,

1122
00:43:31.502 --> 00:43:34.442
but we are part of it, and we all have to get together.

1123
00:43:34.442 --> 00:43:37.214
And all of these little books have

1124
00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:39.230
been monitored since I first put it out.

1125
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.970
Kind of like getting an update,

1126
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.944
I like to know what's going on, and they just--

1127
00:43:43.944 --> 00:43:47.094
it's not going as fast as they would like them to go out.

1128
00:43:48.414 --> 00:43:50.760
It's because the other--

1129
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.442
and they say, don't be disheartened,

1130
00:43:52.442 --> 00:43:55.844
because the other guys has been eons of sequential time,

1131
00:43:55.844 --> 00:43:57.860
dumbing us down to this position.

1132
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.126
And we can't do it in a few years.

1133
00:44:00.126 --> 00:44:02.394
<v Voiceover>No, we all have to just pitch in,</v>

1134
00:44:02.394 --> 00:44:04.002
hold hands, and do it together.

1135
00:44:04.002 --> 00:44:05.522
<v ->There you are.</v>

1136
00:44:05.522 --> 00:44:08.672
Hold hands and hold it up, you got it.

1137
00:44:08.672 --> 00:44:10.184
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

1138
00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:13.870
<v ->Just click on the link below to get a copy</v>

1139
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.930
of his Handbook for a New Paradigm

1140
00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.240
and DVDs of his lectures, and remember that,

1141
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.086
in spite of everything you just heard,

1142
00:44:20.086 --> 00:44:22.606
George is sharing what he knows to be true,

1143
00:44:22.606 --> 00:44:24.664
so that we can begin to prepare ourselves

1144
00:44:24.664 --> 00:44:26.732
for the changes ahead, and take care

1145
00:44:26.732 --> 00:44:28.842
of the most important aspect of being human:

1146
00:44:28.842 --> 00:44:32.036
our hearts and souls and connection to each other.

1147
00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.322
Until next time, thanks for watching.
