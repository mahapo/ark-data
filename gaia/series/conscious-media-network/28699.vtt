1
00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:01.953
<v ->We spoke with Steven Hairfield</v>

2
00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:03.188
about a year and a half ago

3
00:00:03.188 --> 00:00:05.056
and received many kind responses,

4
00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:07.124
so we chose to have another conversation.

5
00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:09.727
This time we spoke of his newest work,

6
00:00:09.727 --> 00:00:12.163
the 12 Sacred Principles of Karma.

7
00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.574
Steven gained this knowledge during his time

8
00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:17.735
living in a monastery among Tibetan monks and masters,

9
00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:21.400
ultimately being ordained into the order as a monk himself.

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.474
As I've told many of my friends and family,

11
00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:25.810
if one were to be issued a handful of books

12
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.197
to guide one's life, this should be one of them.

13
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.993
I have to tell you I just love the new book.

14
00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:41.894
<v ->Thank you.</v>

15
00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:43.769
<v Regina>And it's not just because it's a good read,</v>

16
00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.426
because I think that's an inappropriate way

17
00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:47.866
to even utilize the book.

18
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:51.269
But because it is actually a course for life,

19
00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.941
for finding that holy grail of peace and understanding

20
00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:00.011
and compassion that we're striving toward.

21
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.881
And, yeah, lovely job.

22
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:04.883
And you know, our last two interviews,

23
00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:07.218
we talked a little bit about how you found yourself

24
00:01:07.218 --> 00:01:10.688
in that position to be able to have learned these lessons,

25
00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:12.523
but now we're going right into the lessons

26
00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:16.260
and the 12 principles

27
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.830
of karmic law.

28
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.731
And it's, is that,

29
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:20.732
tell me the exact,

30
00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:23.002
<v ->The 12 Sacred Principles of Karma,</v>

31
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.802
but it's the same.

32
00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:27.205
<v Regina>Thank you, 12 Sacred Principles of Karma.</v>

33
00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:29.841
We'll have it right at the bottom of the screen.

34
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.910
And I've been working my way through it,

35
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.612
and I think one of the things that strikes me

36
00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:38.683
as an overall place to begin is that here we are,

37
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:40.486
a lot of people watching this interview right now

38
00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:42.554
seeking, seeking more and more information,

39
00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:44.322
can't stuff enough into the brain.

40
00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.358
But the one thing we really don't seem to seek

41
00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:49.460
is an understanding of ourselves.

42
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.295
<v ->Well, it all starts and stops with us.</v>

43
00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:53.767
And you are correct, I love to share with people, Regina,

44
00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.501
that one of the most written about subjects,

45
00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.036
if you were to pick one in the history of the world,

46
00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.116
is the subject of love.

47
00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:02.840
But there is an issue.

48
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.577
You have to intellectualize it to write it,

49
00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:08.747
and you have to intellectualize it to read it,

50
00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:11.549
and all the universe has ever asked any of us to do

51
00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.484
is to just experience it.

52
00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:17.022
So, when I wrote the Principles of Karma,

53
00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:18.456
in the way that it was done,

54
00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:21.426
I wanted to give people the experience along with it.

55
00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:24.201
If we don't experience what we're studying,

56
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.898
then what is the value of what we just studied?

57
00:02:26.898 --> 00:02:29.677
If we keep it as an intellectual idea,

58
00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.704
then we're actually avoiding the meaning of it.

59
00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:34.805
As I was sharing with you before the interview,

60
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.208
my teachers, they always made sure

61
00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.111
that I experienced what they were teaching me

62
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:42.112
so that there was no question

63
00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:44.449
that I had instant recognition.

64
00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.985
I appreciate your kind words on the book,

65
00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:50.522
but if people just read it, then I think they're missing.

66
00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.389
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

67
00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.657
<v ->The whole idea of the book.</v>

68
00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:55.393
<v Regina>You have to live with it, really live with it.</v>

69
00:02:55.393 --> 00:02:57.362
Practice, look inside.

70
00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:00.431
<v ->We could literally state with a lot of ease, Regina,</v>

71
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:04.503
that human is a result of divine karma.

72
00:03:04.503 --> 00:03:08.106
We have cause, and we were its effect.

73
00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:10.075
And it's said we're equal to it,

74
00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:12.276
which means we are now our cause

75
00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:15.559
in our lives, or our effect.

76
00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.749
And I know that if people really understood

77
00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.953
the idea behind karma, they probably wouldn't do

78
00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:24.622
half of what they are doing,

79
00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:26.057
uh, two-thirds.

80
00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:29.494
<v Regina>Two-thirds, that's probably more fair.</v>

81
00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:31.429
Let's talk about karma, that word karma,

82
00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:32.864
because it comes up,

83
00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:36.967
my dog ran over your karma,

84
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:40.338
or my karma ran over your karma, or whatnot,

85
00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:43.274
all these cute bumper stickers on these notions of karma,

86
00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:46.944
it's very flip, it's very hip, you can even find it

87
00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:49.680
in marketing campaigns for product now.

88
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.315
<v ->Oh, certainly, make some money.</v>

89
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.516
<v Regina>Make some money.</v>

90
00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:54.386
But that's not exactly what you're talking about

91
00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:55.520
when you speak of karma.

92
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.224
Let's talk about from the perspective you learned,

93
00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:01.927
what is karma?

94
00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:02.910
<v ->Um...</v>

95
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.400
all humor aside, karma is just,

96
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.470
we take it as a joke, I appreciate your analogy of that,

97
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.807
and that Western mind that we run around with,

98
00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:18.776
and karma isn't, I don't want to say it's serious,

99
00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:21.313
but it is extremely genuine.

100
00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:24.182
If you would've put the idea of karma in a simple phrase,

101
00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:27.919
it's an equalizer, it keeps the playing field level,

102
00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.188
it's not that Regina is better than Steven,

103
00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:32.023
or Steven better than Regina,

104
00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:36.427
or a Caucasian being better than an African American

105
00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:38.630
or whatever nationality.

106
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.986
When creation occurred, it came about

107
00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:44.869
through the idea of implicit equality.

108
00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.939
So karma, in a nutshell,

109
00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.509
is a way to ensure that equality stays.

110
00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.545
When we look at the,

111
00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:57.782
well, Newtonian physics, the third law of motion,

112
00:04:57.782 --> 00:05:00.584
it just basically says for every action

113
00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:02.688
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

114
00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:04.456
If a person steals, I can promise you

115
00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:06.358
that you will be stolen from.

116
00:05:06.358 --> 00:05:09.127
If you lie to a person, I can promise you

117
00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:10.796
that you will be lied to.

118
00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:13.598
We will always find ourselves in the very situation

119
00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:17.869
that we have perpetrated ourselves in the first place.

120
00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:20.338
If you steal, you're going to be stolen from.

121
00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:22.474
Let's look at the full ramifications, if you will,

122
00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:26.378
on the idea of somebody having an affair.

123
00:05:26.378 --> 00:05:30.915
Karma has an impact in so many areas with that person.

124
00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:34.052
First off, all of your trust is going to be taken.

125
00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:36.920
If you have an affair, how can you now trust someone

126
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.001
that you would like to love, because you know what you did.

127
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:43.762
Not only that, how could you ever love again.

128
00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:46.664
So now you've lost your trust, you've lost your love,

129
00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:49.201
you've lost your family, the judge is going to make sure

130
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:52.103
that you've lost your bank account and your home.

131
00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.737
And you've essentially lost everything.

132
00:05:53.737 --> 00:05:55.740
Now the interesting part is the money,

133
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.645
the home, the bank account, those can all be rectified,

134
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:02.346
but that idea of trust in a partner,

135
00:06:02.346 --> 00:06:04.750
and the idea of loving a partner,

136
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.617
karma won't let you do it.

137
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.987
It won't allow you until you fully understand

138
00:06:09.987 --> 00:06:14.107
through karmic teachings what you must do...

139
00:06:15.302 --> 00:06:17.029
never comfortable with the idea of must,

140
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:20.108
but what you could do to put yourself back

141
00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:22.233
into a divine state, if you will.

142
00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:25.703
So karma is simply an equalizer

143
00:06:25.703 --> 00:06:28.506
to make sure that the playing field stays equal.

144
00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:30.608
I mean even if we look at the notion that we use here

145
00:06:30.608 --> 00:06:33.077
in the United States, what goes around comes around.

146
00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:34.880
What if that were true?

147
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.749
What if that was actually the case?

148
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:41.119
Love to share with people in a monastery,

149
00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:43.489
when a monk does something, they already know

150
00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:45.724
what their return action is going to be.

151
00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:47.793
And the reason they are is because they work

152
00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:49.560
with these 12 principles.

153
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.362
If you remember when we were upstairs,

154
00:06:51.362 --> 00:06:53.198
I suggested to you that it took my teachers

155
00:06:53.198 --> 00:06:57.302
about 18 months to teach me all 12 of these.

156
00:06:57.302 --> 00:06:59.670
And it's not only the,

157
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.340
what it was about, but how they did it.

158
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.644
Because they made sure that I understood completely.

159
00:07:06.644 --> 00:07:08.646
<v Regina>And that's one of the really,</v>

160
00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:10.815
I think, just juicy parts of the book,

161
00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:14.451
is to see the way in which the very clever way

162
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.987
in which you were taught these lessons.

163
00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:18.056
And we hit upon just a couple of them

164
00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:20.458
in previous interviews, but you go into more depth

165
00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.995
in explaining this and it makes it a very personal

166
00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:26.330
and kind of joyful adventure to go through this

167
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.733
with you in the book.

168
00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:30.034
<v ->Well it is, basically, it's about the adventures</v>

169
00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:33.771
of an American monk as he was learning the ideas of karma.

170
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.009
And truly, if a person really

171
00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:40.111
understands these, if they really internalize these

172
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:43.848
and use these, it fully empowers a person.

173
00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:45.550
I mean, how would you like to know

174
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.321
when you're being drained before you ever became drained?

175
00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:53.692
How would you like to know how to literally attract

176
00:07:53.692 --> 00:07:56.394
to you what you wanted?

177
00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.331
I mean, literally we are magnets.

178
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.733
What controls the magnet is the idea of karma.

179
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:06.937
We can pull things to us, or we can push them away.

180
00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:09.573
And interestingly enough, we spend more time

181
00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:13.444
pushing it away than we ever do bringing it to ourselves.

182
00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:14.745
<v Regina>This is very true.</v>

183
00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.682
I'm going to get into that toward the end of this,

184
00:08:17.682 --> 00:08:19.317
because I want to kind of progress

185
00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:20.852
through some other things, and one of the things

186
00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:23.320
that comes up for me as you're speaking

187
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.758
is perhaps part of the giggle factor of karma

188
00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:31.495
and the trivializing of it might be down

189
00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:35.700
to the fact that time is

190
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.135
an element that we don't understand

191
00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:41.572
that when it comes to something as ubiquitous

192
00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:43.275
as cause and effect.

193
00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:46.176
We may not ever see the timing on the effect.

194
00:08:46.176 --> 00:08:49.180
And this is illustrated when someone sees

195
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.516
something horrible that has just happened

196
00:08:51.516 --> 00:08:54.452
and been perpetrated against one person versus another,

197
00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:56.787
maybe a car bombing has been perpetrated

198
00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:59.691
and they don't see the car bomber filmed

199
00:08:59.691 --> 00:09:01.793
or brought to justice, for example.

200
00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:03.795
And so they think, what is this karma.

201
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:07.099
That fellow was never caught, he never went to jail.

202
00:09:07.099 --> 00:09:08.499
And so because people are looking

203
00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:10.868
through the more materialistic lens,

204
00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:12.737
and also because of this impatience

205
00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:15.574
to get to cause and effect,

206
00:09:15.574 --> 00:09:18.275
to see the outcome of it,

207
00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:21.129
people have a tendency to disengage...

208
00:09:22.448 --> 00:09:23.757
in the West.

209
00:09:23.757 --> 00:09:26.383
<v ->Yeah, um, and it's easy for us to do</v>

210
00:09:26.383 --> 00:09:28.653
when we disengage we attempt to run and hide.

211
00:09:28.653 --> 00:09:31.255
It's actually all it is that we're attempting to do.

212
00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:35.326
But if can get back to that scenario of the car bomber,

213
00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:37.762
by the way, they don't usually get out of the car.

214
00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:40.932
<v Regina>Well, that's true, some of them go with it.</v>

215
00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:41.799
That's true.

216
00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:43.267
<v ->But you see, it's fascinating to me</v>

217
00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:47.421
when I was working with my teachers in India and Nepal,

218
00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:51.715
there would be times where they would help a person

219
00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:52.843
and there would be times

220
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:56.847
where it was almost like they ignored it.

221
00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:59.082
And I asked them why.

222
00:09:59.082 --> 00:10:01.486
I mean, here's a woman that's being molested

223
00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:04.288
and you're saying I cannot interfere.

224
00:10:04.288 --> 00:10:06.924
And that's when I really understood karma.

225
00:10:06.924 --> 00:10:08.392
Karma we don't understand,

226
00:10:08.392 --> 00:10:11.696
that we carry it from lifetime to lifetime,

227
00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:14.098
and from moment to moment,

228
00:10:14.098 --> 00:10:16.133
and if we're always doing the optimum,

229
00:10:16.133 --> 00:10:18.702
the most kind, compassionate thing that we can do

230
00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:23.687
with our fellow humans, we are negating any level of karma.

231
00:10:23.687 --> 00:10:26.711
I didn't realize it, but my teachers

232
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:28.780
when they were explaining that to me,

233
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.847
they used the analogy of my own childhood

234
00:10:30.847 --> 00:10:33.784
and the difficulties that I had in the younger years.

235
00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:35.653
And they looked at me and kind of smiled and said,

236
00:10:35.653 --> 00:10:37.222
"You didn't realize that you were working

237
00:10:37.222 --> 00:10:39.056
"through your karma debt when you were young

238
00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.991
"and you could handle it."

239
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:42.860
Most people will work through their karma debt

240
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.763
when they are older and frail and they can't handle it.

241
00:10:45.763 --> 00:10:50.668
But my point is is you can see a karma debt working out

242
00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:52.837
versus one that is being created.

243
00:10:52.837 --> 00:10:57.524
If it's one that's being created, I'm gonna stop it.

244
00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:00.345
But if it's one that's being played through

245
00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:05.249
and worked out, no, because if they step in to stop it

246
00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:07.551
or negate it, guess what?

247
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.555
They now have that person's karmic debt

248
00:11:09.555 --> 00:11:10.855
and they won't do it.

249
00:11:10.855 --> 00:11:12.389
We don't realize it when it comes to karma

250
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:14.625
that we have individual karma,

251
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.695
you have family karma,

252
00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:18.830
you have neighborhood karma,

253
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.166
you have city, state, nation, and world.

254
00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.902
It's all there.

255
00:11:23.902 --> 00:11:26.670
If we look at what's being played out

256
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.738
in the world right now,

257
00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:30.307
we can actually see karma being played out.

258
00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:36.179
I know there's gonna be people who disagree with this,

259
00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:40.784
but it might none of it happened.

260
00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.620
Could it possibly be that our country

261
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.423
is very nosy and meddlesome?

262
00:11:45.423 --> 00:11:49.293
And they wanted us to mind our own business?

263
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:51.330
Then we step into Iraq,

264
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.098
and the karma continues into Afghanistan.

265
00:11:54.098 --> 00:11:56.801
What we don't realize is this,

266
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.720
our military is spread all over the place.

267
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.941
Who's protecting America?

268
00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:04.374
No one.

269
00:12:04.374 --> 00:12:05.743
Karma.

270
00:12:05.743 --> 00:12:09.046
When we look at the recent fringes

271
00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:11.549
of economic collapse, it's karma.

272
00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:14.886
Greed, got caught in that.

273
00:12:14.886 --> 00:12:17.757
And we see the playing out of that still.

274
00:12:17.757 --> 00:12:20.091
So we can look at karma in a variety of ways.

275
00:12:20.091 --> 00:12:22.527
And I sincerely share with everybody it's,

276
00:12:22.527 --> 00:12:24.655
it's as genuine as you can get.

277
00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:27.432
<v Regina>Yes, and we have to really</v>

278
00:12:27.432 --> 00:12:30.201
avoid judging,

279
00:12:30.201 --> 00:12:32.503
because it's as you said.

280
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:33.937
<v ->America not judge?</v>

281
00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:37.942
<v Regina>Well, when you give the example of the monks</v>

282
00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:41.579
not interfering in a molestation playing itself out

283
00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:42.881
because they understood this was part

284
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:46.450
of a karmic return of events and debt,

285
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.686
whatever you like to call it,

286
00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:51.288
they have had the training to be able to have

287
00:12:51.288 --> 00:12:54.524
the wisdom to understand that in that moment.

288
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.828
Whereas, you can't really judge.

289
00:12:56.828 --> 00:12:58.562
The point is, it's very difficult

290
00:12:58.562 --> 00:13:01.032
because you can't judge another person's karmic path

291
00:13:01.032 --> 00:13:02.766
when you see something playing out.

292
00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:04.001
Is it the instigation?

293
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:05.904
Is karma being created there?

294
00:13:05.904 --> 00:13:08.138
How would an average person walking

295
00:13:08.138 --> 00:13:10.574
by that scene know the difference?

296
00:13:10.574 --> 00:13:13.244
<v ->The average person walking by that scene would not.</v>

297
00:13:13.244 --> 00:13:14.828
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

298
00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:17.765
<v ->And it's not that they couldn't.</v>

299
00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:22.520
Monks are well known as remote viewers.

300
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.323
Remote meaning it spans time,

301
00:13:25.323 --> 00:13:27.591
also not just distance.

302
00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:30.929
And they can instantly see any event like the molestation,

303
00:13:30.929 --> 00:13:33.864
in other words, she was a male in another lifetime

304
00:13:33.864 --> 00:13:36.634
and the male that was molesting her was the female

305
00:13:36.634 --> 00:13:38.870
and the roles were actually reversed.

306
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.390
If that males wanted to break that karmic tie...

307
00:13:44.508 --> 00:13:45.676
he wouldn't have done it.

308
00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:46.610
<v Regina>Right.</v>

309
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.445
<v ->And that's how it's worked through.</v>

310
00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:50.982
You see, temptation is the key.

311
00:13:50.982 --> 00:13:54.618
You cannot tell me that a thief doesn't consider

312
00:13:54.618 --> 00:13:56.987
not stealing before they do it.

313
00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:59.624
No matter how many times they've done it.

314
00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:03.160
You cannot tell me that a Bernie Madoff wasn't aware

315
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.330
of what he was doing.

316
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.766
You see, there's how you break the karmic tie.

317
00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:11.502
When you're tempted to do a thing

318
00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:13.438
and you know it's inappropriate,

319
00:14:13.438 --> 00:14:17.675
there's already the message that you've done this before,

320
00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:19.877
don't do it again.

321
00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:23.382
You see, we create those karmic ties from life to life,

322
00:14:23.382 --> 00:14:25.883
if the person believes in reincarnation.

323
00:14:25.883 --> 00:14:27.851
And if you don't, well, that's okay.

324
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:29.854
But it is real, if for no other reason,

325
00:14:29.854 --> 00:14:32.156
the universal idea of infinity,

326
00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:35.442
so life is infinite as you or I.

327
00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:40.431
We can know our karmic debts

328
00:14:40.431 --> 00:14:41.965
through certain meditations

329
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.134
which I would do,

330
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.003
but I guess it's for another time.

331
00:14:47.003 --> 00:14:49.673
They'll open all of your past lives

332
00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:51.241
so you can see your karmic events

333
00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:53.577
so you can bring them to resolution.

334
00:14:53.577 --> 00:14:56.547
In other words, if I encounter you on the street

335
00:14:56.547 --> 00:15:00.584
and I realize a karmic tie, I can rob you or hug you.

336
00:15:00.584 --> 00:15:03.321
I would much rather hug you and break that karmic tie

337
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:05.389
and then we both can move on.

338
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:07.892
And that's how karma works.

339
00:15:07.892 --> 00:15:09.561
It is relentless.

340
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:12.131
<v Regina>It's ever present, relentless, in the moment,</v>

341
00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:14.480
down to our very thought.

342
00:15:15.459 --> 00:15:19.370
And I suppose what I was saying in that in part

343
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.440
is that it's very easy for us to try to assess or judge

344
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.378
a situation and then take actions slash interfere

345
00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:28.946
in the situation.

346
00:15:28.946 --> 00:15:31.783
And it's often,

347
00:15:31.783 --> 00:15:34.384
I don't know that there's a magic bullet

348
00:15:34.384 --> 00:15:37.656
if you don't have the direct intuition to know

349
00:15:37.656 --> 00:15:39.690
what is playing out in that moment.

350
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.092
Certainly it doesn't behoove anyone to judge it,

351
00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:44.661
especially if you're not going to take action anyway,

352
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:45.573
right?

353
00:15:46.443 --> 00:15:48.165
<v ->Everybody I work with,</v>

354
00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:50.033
and this would be my challenge to anyone listening

355
00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.739
to the video, go seven days of your life

356
00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:56.674
just following the path of acceptance.

357
00:15:56.674 --> 00:15:58.543
That's it.

358
00:15:58.543 --> 00:16:01.045
Accept everything going on around you,

359
00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:03.180
within you,

360
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.484
and if you can go seven days, my hat's off to you.

361
00:16:06.484 --> 00:16:08.418
It actually took me about nine months

362
00:16:08.418 --> 00:16:11.788
in the walls of a monastery to do it,

363
00:16:11.788 --> 00:16:13.224
and out in everyday life.

364
00:16:13.224 --> 00:16:15.893
So if we want to have a magic bullet,

365
00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:17.561
that would be it.

366
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:20.898
I got an e-mail the other day from a lovely lady

367
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:23.635
I've been working with in Oklahoma,

368
00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:28.005
and she says, "Steven, I can only make it five minutes."

369
00:16:28.005 --> 00:16:29.373
And I e-mailed her back and said,

370
00:16:29.373 --> 00:16:33.827
"Coleen, you just climbed a mountain in that five minutes.

371
00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:36.580
"And if anybody can do it in five minutes,

372
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.383
"then you can do it for 10."

373
00:16:38.383 --> 00:16:41.452
You see, it's not looking at the seven days,

374
00:16:41.452 --> 00:16:43.655
it's looking at that moment.

375
00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:45.589
Can I accept this?

376
00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:47.691
Here's the interesting thing,

377
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:50.327
it doesn't matter whether you do or you don't,

378
00:16:50.327 --> 00:16:52.429
because it's there.

379
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:55.715
And that person, and the odds are they created it anyway.

380
00:16:57.601 --> 00:16:59.636
Here's another way that we can look at karma.

381
00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:02.856
We've heard the saying that like attracts like, right?

382
00:17:03.874 --> 00:17:08.027
If a person is afraid of having their home broken into,

383
00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:12.682
and there is a thief that likes breaking into homes,

384
00:17:12.682 --> 00:17:15.420
what we don't realize is, that's like mine.

385
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Regina>A perfect match.</v>

386
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.656
<v ->And they will find each other.</v>

387
00:17:18.656 --> 00:17:20.558
So don't be afraid of it.

388
00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:22.526
Now what about judgment anyway.

389
00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:25.397
And I realize that's what you're asking me.

390
00:17:25.397 --> 00:17:27.330
<v Regina>Well, yes, because we don't--</v>

391
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.298
<v ->It's a waste of time.</v>

392
00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.535
<v Regina>That's kind of the point I was getting to,</v>

393
00:17:30.535 --> 00:17:31.612
I suppose.

394
00:17:31.612 --> 00:17:33.838
<v ->My lovely bride said this to me one day,</v>

395
00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:37.240
she said that, "Isn't it interesting how we clothe

396
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.244
"other people and how we judge them to be?

397
00:17:40.244 --> 00:17:42.813
"But we don't realize that when we do that,

398
00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:44.815
"we'll never know that person.

399
00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:46.683
"But we will know their judgment."

400
00:17:46.683 --> 00:17:49.186
Which is actually why the third principle of karma

401
00:17:49.186 --> 00:17:52.622
is in there, and that's the law of the mirrors.

402
00:17:52.622 --> 00:17:55.559
Life is our direct reflection, and it'll show us

403
00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:59.364
our judgment every single time, an illusion.

404
00:17:59.364 --> 00:18:00.397
<v Regina>Yeah, and I wanted to go</v>

405
00:18:00.397 --> 00:18:03.701
into that one, actually, in more detail.

406
00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:05.202
And you just said, before we go there,

407
00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:07.871
there's another thing that's just kind of been triggered

408
00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:11.443
along the way, and that is, you were talking about

409
00:18:11.443 --> 00:18:13.945
it doesn't matter if it was five minutes or 10 minutes

410
00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:15.946
or a week, it's about the being

411
00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:18.115
in that awareness, in that moment.

412
00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:21.928
And there's one thing that you say you were taught,

413
00:18:21.928 --> 00:18:23.854
I don't know whether it was Master Lovesong,

414
00:18:23.854 --> 00:18:27.457
or another one of them, I don't remember now,

415
00:18:27.457 --> 00:18:31.895
which was telling you, allow your mind to follow your eyes,

416
00:18:31.895 --> 00:18:34.532
and I thought, how elegant and simple,

417
00:18:34.532 --> 00:18:36.533
and how incredibly difficult.

418
00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.635
<v ->Yes it is.</v>

419
00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:38.802
<v Regina>Can you tell me about that</v>

420
00:18:38.802 --> 00:18:41.604
being in the present from that perspective?

421
00:18:41.604 --> 00:18:43.207
<v ->A lot of people think that all monks do</v>

422
00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:44.745
is sit around and meditate.

423
00:18:44.745 --> 00:18:46.710
And that's, no.

424
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.045
Sometimes, yeah.

425
00:18:48.045 --> 00:18:51.781
And there are periods in the day where they do.

426
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:55.653
Being a monk is a 24/7 job.

427
00:18:55.653 --> 00:18:58.923
It's understanding why you're not accepting,

428
00:18:58.923 --> 00:19:02.258
it's understanding how can you use that time machine

429
00:19:02.258 --> 00:19:04.828
between your ears and go into the future or the past,

430
00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:07.965
and that's where most humans are.

431
00:19:07.965 --> 00:19:10.067
What Lovesing actually said to me was this

432
00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:12.502
"Young man learned to keep your mind and thoughts

433
00:19:12.502 --> 00:19:14.905
"always behind your eyes."

434
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.574
He said, "No matter where you look,

435
00:19:16.574 --> 00:19:18.642
"make sure that your mind and thoughts

436
00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:21.011
"are on exactly what you're looking at."

437
00:19:21.011 --> 00:19:24.014
I'm looking at you, so my mind and thoughts are on you.

438
00:19:24.014 --> 00:19:27.017
If I look up at Scott, now my mind and thoughts

439
00:19:27.017 --> 00:19:29.420
are on Scott, and you're no longer even in the picture.

440
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.021
But now it's back.

441
00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:32.773
That...

442
00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:35.890
is actually easy.

443
00:19:37.095 --> 00:19:40.146
And what it does do, is it eliminates worry.

444
00:19:41.899 --> 00:19:44.255
When you look at the idea of karma,

445
00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:47.905
and in today's economic issues,

446
00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:51.108
people worry about lack without realizing

447
00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:55.662
that they're creating lack by that mentality.

448
00:19:56.681 --> 00:19:59.149
If a person wants abundance,

449
00:19:59.149 --> 00:20:02.520
we have to get over poverty consciousness.

450
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.988
And where I'm going is this, what affects it?

451
00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:07.158
Is here we are about to enter the first of the month,

452
00:20:07.158 --> 00:20:09.292
and let's say you have $500 to your name,

453
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.895
yet you know you have to pay out $2200

454
00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:14.731
by the end of the month, guess what the person is doing?

455
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.767
They're negating the whole idea by not keeping

456
00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:19.736
their mind and thoughts behind their eyes.

457
00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:22.205
If they keep their mind and thoughts behind their eyes,

458
00:20:22.205 --> 00:20:25.709
today is only the first, it's not the 30th.

459
00:20:25.709 --> 00:20:29.380
Let it take care of itself, and it will.

460
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.015
All we can do is create in this world.

461
00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:34.718
It is not possible whatsoever for us to uncreate.

462
00:20:34.718 --> 00:20:36.887
I don't know about you, Regina, but I wasn't born

463
00:20:36.887 --> 00:20:38.756
with an eraser in my hand,

464
00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:40.691
which means I don't get to erase the blackboard

465
00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:44.228
that once I created now, I've got to deal with it.

466
00:20:44.228 --> 00:20:48.131
And if we want to create lack, that's an option.

467
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:50.167
If you want to create abundance,

468
00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:51.735
you have to remember

469
00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:53.836
the universe does have a sense of humor,

470
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.986
'cause you can have an abundance of lack.

471
00:20:56.986 --> 00:20:57.908
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

472
00:20:57.908 --> 00:20:59.776
<v ->Depending on how you're doing it,</v>

473
00:20:59.776 --> 00:21:01.077
and what you're doing with it.

474
00:21:01.077 --> 00:21:03.280
If people really understood the idea of karma,

475
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.317
first off, for you, me, or any human to manifest anything,

476
00:21:07.317 --> 00:21:09.653
you have to be in the present.

477
00:21:09.653 --> 00:21:13.391
And that present is when your mind is right behind your eyes

478
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:15.425
and you know what's in front of you,

479
00:21:15.425 --> 00:21:16.894
you know what's going on.

480
00:21:16.894 --> 00:21:17.528
Why?

481
00:21:17.528 --> 00:21:19.496
Because that's what's in front of you.

482
00:21:19.496 --> 00:21:22.399
And if you're really astute and you understand karma,

483
00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:26.036
you'll even know what's coming long before it gets there.

484
00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:28.939
It's not a question of where is it or when is it,

485
00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:31.875
it's just a question of you watching for it.

486
00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:35.679
And when you keep your mind behind your eyes,

487
00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:37.448
you'll always see it coming.

488
00:21:37.448 --> 00:21:38.782
<v Regina>And as you said a moment ago,</v>

489
00:21:38.782 --> 00:21:41.752
it also starts taking some of the stress and fear out

490
00:21:41.752 --> 00:21:43.220
because you're not projecting

491
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.723
the negative potential outcomes into the future,

492
00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:47.958
because they haven't occurred yet.

493
00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:49.894
There's no point in even going there.

494
00:21:49.894 --> 00:21:53.831
<v ->We're actually conditioned to that in the Western world.</v>

495
00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:56.633
Living by other people's standards

496
00:21:56.633 --> 00:21:59.069
is really what we have done to ourselves.

497
00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.071
But if we practice the idea of keeping our mind

498
00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:04.208
behind our eyes, our mind and thoughts,

499
00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:06.277
not that they're separate,

500
00:22:06.277 --> 00:22:08.211
you become a very powerful person.

501
00:22:08.211 --> 00:22:10.948
And what it does is it creates presence.

502
00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:11.649
Why?

503
00:22:11.649 --> 00:22:13.850
Because you're present.

504
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.620
And to be present, you can do anything

505
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.188
in that moment that you want.

506
00:22:18.188 --> 00:22:20.357
Imagine if this thing that we call the Creator

507
00:22:20.357 --> 00:22:23.626
wasn't present when it created.

508
00:22:23.626 --> 00:22:24.762
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

509
00:22:24.762 --> 00:22:26.096
<v ->Exactly.</v>

510
00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.263
We're not,

511
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.766
we're not, I mean we're all over the place.

512
00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:31.167
But what we don't realize is

513
00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:33.236
is if the first principle of karma is correct,

514
00:22:33.236 --> 00:22:35.639
what you sow, so shall you reap,

515
00:22:35.639 --> 00:22:39.042
which is a statement that's about four to 5,000 years old,

516
00:22:39.042 --> 00:22:43.046
that when you're worried about lack, you're creating that.

517
00:22:43.046 --> 00:22:46.149
If you're worried about not being lovable,

518
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:48.718
you're creating that.

519
00:22:48.718 --> 00:22:50.054
Whatever it is that you choose,

520
00:22:50.054 --> 00:22:53.423
if you knew that you could have that,

521
00:22:53.423 --> 00:22:56.626
wouldn't you want to have whatever it is?

522
00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.396
Then all the human has to do is understand

523
00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:01.364
the idea of karma and then get out of the way of it.

524
00:23:01.364 --> 00:23:04.868
Because there, the fields in reality,

525
00:23:04.868 --> 00:23:07.338
can either attract something to you

526
00:23:07.338 --> 00:23:09.439
or can push it away.

527
00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:13.109
And the second principle is exactly that,

528
00:23:13.109 --> 00:23:14.645
and that's the one that says,

529
00:23:14.645 --> 00:23:18.281
"You attract to you what you are, not what you want."

530
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:21.017
So if you're worried about not having enough

531
00:23:21.017 --> 00:23:25.055
at the end of the month, you will be assured

532
00:23:25.055 --> 00:23:28.925
that you won't have enough at the end of the month.

533
00:23:28.925 --> 00:23:33.922
But if you stay in today, and you do what you can today,

534
00:23:33.922 --> 00:23:37.000
then the end of the month will take care of itself.

535
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.003
<v Regina>That's a very powerful reminder,</v>

536
00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:42.540
and that will certainly resonate with a lot of people

537
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.674
who are finding themselves in that situation,

538
00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:47.011
that's very minute, so I thank you for that.

539
00:23:47.011 --> 00:23:50.680
<v ->There's, one thing I hope</v>

540
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.649
to portray to everybody in this,

541
00:23:52.649 --> 00:23:54.368
and that's that...

542
00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:58.488
when we make something more powerful than us,

543
00:23:58.488 --> 00:24:00.892
you can't have it.

544
00:24:00.892 --> 00:24:02.058
<v Regina>Very good point.</v>

545
00:24:02.058 --> 00:24:05.929
<v ->And if for no other reason, it controls you.</v>

546
00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:09.371
When we look at the idea of money,

547
00:24:09.371 --> 00:24:11.134
we've given it too much power,

548
00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:13.570
and all it is is an energy on a piece of paper

549
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.106
which actually means very little.

550
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:18.308
In the ancient ideas, it says we have dominion

551
00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:20.344
over all things, which basically means

552
00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:22.346
give power to nothing.

553
00:24:22.346 --> 00:24:24.547
I mean imagine if you went out and got into your car,

554
00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:27.518
started it up, and all of a sudden your car started

555
00:24:27.518 --> 00:24:29.385
it's just gonna do whatever it wants to do,

556
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:31.588
no matter what you want.

557
00:24:31.588 --> 00:24:33.724
How far are you gonna get?

558
00:24:33.724 --> 00:24:35.445
And that's what we do in life.

559
00:24:35.445 --> 00:24:38.663
We forget that we're giving all of this power and control

560
00:24:38.663 --> 00:24:40.797
to everything around us.

561
00:24:40.797 --> 00:24:43.734
We love that person, so therefore you own me.

562
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:45.152
Or...

563
00:24:47.003 --> 00:24:50.741
I'm not good enough for the kind of success I want,

564
00:24:50.741 --> 00:24:54.211
I'd love to be an actor on the stage,

565
00:24:54.211 --> 00:24:57.714
without ever realizing you are an actor on the stage of life

566
00:24:57.714 --> 00:25:00.516
but you take the other too seriously.

567
00:25:00.516 --> 00:25:04.721
This is another thing, seriousness doesn't work,

568
00:25:04.721 --> 00:25:06.357
it puts too much pressure.

569
00:25:06.357 --> 00:25:09.627
If we take it out genuinely, then it has substance,

570
00:25:09.627 --> 00:25:11.162
then it means something.

571
00:25:11.162 --> 00:25:15.265
If you take money genuinely, and you always see it coming

572
00:25:15.265 --> 00:25:19.636
at you, never away from you, then it will.

573
00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:20.571
Why?

574
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.773
Because if everybody watching this, and even yourself,

575
00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:26.042
no matter what you've gone through in your life, Regina,

576
00:25:26.042 --> 00:25:28.912
you've always had exactly what you wanted,

577
00:25:28.912 --> 00:25:30.881
and the universe has taken care of that.

578
00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:32.449
Sure, you may have sweated bullets,

579
00:25:32.449 --> 00:25:36.953
you may have worried, you may have done all sorts of things,

580
00:25:36.953 --> 00:25:40.356
to where you think you made it happen,

581
00:25:40.356 --> 00:25:43.392
and all we have to do is accept it and allow it to happen.

582
00:25:43.392 --> 00:25:44.428
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

583
00:25:44.428 --> 00:25:47.497
I feel very fortunate in life in that way

584
00:25:47.497 --> 00:25:50.700
in that I feel somehow that exactly what I need

585
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.436
has always been there exactly when I've needed it.

586
00:25:53.436 --> 00:25:54.537
<v ->And it always will.</v>

587
00:25:54.537 --> 00:25:55.238
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

588
00:25:55.238 --> 00:25:56.707
I feel that's very true.

589
00:25:56.707 --> 00:25:58.475
Yeah, and when I was younger, though,

590
00:25:58.475 --> 00:26:01.044
I would stressed more over it because I didn't,

591
00:26:01.044 --> 00:26:03.414
I hadn't seen the cycles of life go long enough

592
00:26:03.414 --> 00:26:06.316
and had a chance to kind of soften into it enough

593
00:26:06.316 --> 00:26:09.487
to be able to see this cause and effect as it occurs,

594
00:26:09.487 --> 00:26:11.488
and the cycles of life as they occur.

595
00:26:11.488 --> 00:26:14.825
And once you do, there is a softening,

596
00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:17.428
there is a more of an acceptance rather than trying

597
00:26:17.428 --> 00:26:20.331
to fight what appears to be happening.

598
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:23.434
<v ->Now you know how I got all this white hair.</v>

599
00:26:23.434 --> 00:26:25.435
It's not because I'm a wizard,

600
00:26:25.435 --> 00:26:27.714
it's because I used to stress over all that stuff

601
00:26:27.714 --> 00:26:29.106
when I was a lot younger.

602
00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:32.942
<v Regina>Yeah, it does change with hopefully some grace</v>

603
00:26:32.942 --> 00:26:34.444
and maturity in life.

604
00:26:34.444 --> 00:26:37.547
Do you want to get into some of the laws now,

605
00:26:37.547 --> 00:26:40.550
the karmic laws, I think it would be kind of,

606
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.252
we would be talking for hours

607
00:26:43.252 --> 00:26:45.422
if we were going to do all of them.

608
00:26:45.422 --> 00:26:47.524
<v ->It is, as I was sharing with you</v>

609
00:26:47.524 --> 00:26:50.027
before we started doing the interview,

610
00:26:50.027 --> 00:26:54.464
it actually took them 18 months to walk me through all 12.

611
00:26:54.464 --> 00:26:56.533
<v Regina>Yeah, so we're not going to accomplish this</v>

612
00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:58.635
in one hour, but I figure we can touch

613
00:26:58.635 --> 00:27:02.472
on maybe three or four just to give our viewers

614
00:27:02.472 --> 00:27:05.409
an understanding of some of what they have

615
00:27:05.409 --> 00:27:08.245
to look forward to if they're going to take this up

616
00:27:08.245 --> 00:27:11.349
and use this as a course of study for themselves.

617
00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:15.985
<v ->If one wants mastership, whatever that looks like</v>

618
00:27:15.985 --> 00:27:18.722
for the individual, then this is a key player

619
00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:20.023
in that self-mastery.

620
00:27:20.023 --> 00:27:21.357
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

621
00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:23.560
<v ->And I've already related two of the principles to you:</v>

622
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.094
what you sow, so shall you reap.

623
00:27:25.094 --> 00:27:27.765
And that's in every thought, emotion,

624
00:27:27.765 --> 00:27:29.767
act, and action that you do.

625
00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:33.239
You are planting seeds, and sooner or later,

626
00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:35.539
they're gonna come up.

627
00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:38.207
Sooner or later, whatever you've planted,

628
00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:40.144
and I don't care if it was from 30 years ago,

629
00:27:40.144 --> 00:27:44.581
it's waiting for an opportune moment to show up.

630
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:48.419
And if you remember what you've planted, you'll know.

631
00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:50.120
And you'll know when and where.

632
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.155
<v Regina>When it comes for you,</v>

633
00:27:51.155 --> 00:27:51.902
you will recognize it.

634
00:27:51.902 --> 00:27:52.612
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

635
00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:54.857
And it's not necessarily the grim reaper, either.

636
00:27:54.857 --> 00:27:55.859
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

637
00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:57.928
<v ->And of course, the second one, it's huge.</v>

638
00:27:57.928 --> 00:28:00.731
If, when people can master this one,

639
00:28:00.731 --> 00:28:03.700
you attract to you what you are not what you want,

640
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.767
I mean that's huge.

641
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.336
<v Regina>That requires a great amount of acceptance,</v>

642
00:28:06.336 --> 00:28:08.772
personal responsibility and acceptance.

643
00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:09.973
<v ->Now that's number 12.</v>

644
00:28:09.973 --> 00:28:13.978
<v Regina>Okay, well, so, let's jump into number three,</v>

645
00:28:13.978 --> 00:28:16.213
and each one of these would be an hour interview

646
00:28:16.213 --> 00:28:18.415
in and of themselves with beautiful examples

647
00:28:18.415 --> 00:28:19.817
like you've given in the book,

648
00:28:19.817 --> 00:28:21.751
really walking people through the process

649
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:23.819
of their own thoughts as they're being exposed

650
00:28:23.819 --> 00:28:25.021
to the information.

651
00:28:25.021 --> 00:28:27.325
So let's go to the third law of karma,

652
00:28:27.325 --> 00:28:29.492
the principle of humility.

653
00:28:29.492 --> 00:28:33.530
This is really a big one in the Western world.

654
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.500
Humility is not necessarily an adjective

655
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.435
that we would tend to use for one another in the West,

656
00:28:39.435 --> 00:28:40.991
for the most part.

657
00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:43.973
<v ->Maybe that's why we in the West experience</v>

658
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.575
so much humiliation,

659
00:28:46.575 --> 00:28:49.290
because it's just a teacher of humility.

660
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.451
Another way you could look at the law of humility

661
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:57.488
is, it's also termed

662
00:28:57.488 --> 00:28:59.322
as the bearers of relationship.

663
00:28:59.322 --> 00:29:01.661
Who are you in that moment?

664
00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:04.026
How many people have you met in your life

665
00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:06.796
that were angry people and you said to them

666
00:29:06.796 --> 00:29:08.598
or asked them, "Why are you so angry"

667
00:29:08.598 --> 00:29:10.768
and they denied its existence?

668
00:29:10.768 --> 00:29:11.901
<v Regina>Every now and then, yes,</v>

669
00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:13.202
I've known some.

670
00:29:13.202 --> 00:29:15.038
<v ->Okay, but if they happened to look around them</v>

671
00:29:15.038 --> 00:29:17.407
at all the angry people that they're surrounded by,

672
00:29:17.407 --> 00:29:20.611
they would see their own reflection in the mirror of life.

673
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:22.479
And a lot of humility operates simply

674
00:29:22.479 --> 00:29:27.250
by being able to see yourself in the circumstances,

675
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:31.054
the situations, and the people that are around you.

676
00:29:31.054 --> 00:29:35.057
I can certainly assure you that a peaceful, loving person

677
00:29:35.057 --> 00:29:38.595
will only have around them peaceful, loving people

678
00:29:38.595 --> 00:29:41.564
because that's all that life can reflect back to them.

679
00:29:41.564 --> 00:29:43.233
It doesn't mean that that person doesn't run

680
00:29:43.233 --> 00:29:46.636
into, we'll say, challenges.

681
00:29:46.636 --> 00:29:48.738
It's an opportunity for further growth.

682
00:29:48.738 --> 00:29:51.542
But I can certainly assure you that

683
00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:53.576
a violent angry person would never be able

684
00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:55.678
to enter that realm, and they wouldn't.

685
00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:58.414
Or the odds of it are greatly reduced.

686
00:29:58.414 --> 00:30:01.018
So life, in essence, it's always simply

687
00:30:01.018 --> 00:30:03.019
just going to show you who you are

688
00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:04.854
in any given moment.

689
00:30:04.854 --> 00:30:06.990
A beautiful example would be, Regina,

690
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.392
is when you leave the house in the morning,

691
00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:11.761
let's say to go shopping or whatever,

692
00:30:11.761 --> 00:30:14.931
and you're feeling very easy, very peaceful,

693
00:30:14.931 --> 00:30:16.734
and extremely harmonious,

694
00:30:16.734 --> 00:30:18.267
what are the people like when you meet them?

695
00:30:18.267 --> 00:30:19.403
<v Regina>Oh, it's just fabulous,</v>

696
00:30:19.403 --> 00:30:21.438
everybody is lovely.

697
00:30:21.438 --> 00:30:23.139
<v ->And they're just like that.</v>

698
00:30:23.139 --> 00:30:25.775
And you go out the next day, and let's say,

699
00:30:25.775 --> 00:30:27.510
you're impatient, you're kind of frustrated,

700
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.045
what are the people like you meet?

701
00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:31.782
<v Regina>It's a very disconnected experience.</v>

702
00:30:31.782 --> 00:30:33.148
<v ->Okay, the point is</v>

703
00:30:33.148 --> 00:30:35.252
is that they are reflecting back to you.

704
00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:37.654
All right, there's cause and there's effect.

705
00:30:37.654 --> 00:30:41.190
Why would the universe, let's say you're being

706
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.960
peaceful and loving, put you with somebody

707
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.796
that's very angry and frustrated?

708
00:30:46.796 --> 00:30:48.407
There would only be one reason,

709
00:30:48.407 --> 00:30:49.465
<v Regina>There's a resonance there.</v>

710
00:30:49.465 --> 00:30:51.034
<v ->No, that reason would be,</v>

711
00:30:51.034 --> 00:30:52.302
that you could show this person

712
00:30:52.302 --> 00:30:55.404
the possibility of a different path.

713
00:30:55.404 --> 00:30:59.075
Now here's a karmic role that now can be worked out,

714
00:30:59.075 --> 00:31:01.844
that you, the only reason the universe put you there

715
00:31:01.844 --> 00:31:04.314
is because you understand that loving, peaceful side

716
00:31:04.314 --> 00:31:08.017
of yourself, and this person is worth sharing it with.

717
00:31:08.017 --> 00:31:09.353
<v Regina>I see what you're saying, yes.</v>

718
00:31:09.353 --> 00:31:11.921
How would those two come together, you're saying?

719
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:13.622
<v ->Right, that would be the only reason.</v>

720
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Regina>Yes, that makes sense.</v>

721
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.860
<v ->It's always better to bring someone to your level</v>

722
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.896
than it is to go to their level,

723
00:31:19.896 --> 00:31:24.667
and that's another idea behind the law of humility.

724
00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:27.771
But I can promise you, life is always going to show you

725
00:31:27.771 --> 00:31:30.240
who you are in any given moment.

726
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.175
And when you're in a monastery, as an example,

727
00:31:32.175 --> 00:31:34.845
with 500 monks and you do something,

728
00:31:34.845 --> 00:31:37.514
you're gonna have 500 monks reflecting to you

729
00:31:37.514 --> 00:31:40.750
what you just did until you get the point.

730
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.784
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

731
00:31:41.784 --> 00:31:44.320
Well now, in the West, there's a whole other overlay

732
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.092
to this and that is that this notion of be powerful,

733
00:31:49.092 --> 00:31:53.796
be strong, stand in your power and so forth,

734
00:31:53.796 --> 00:31:57.701
that humility actually is seen as a negative sometimes.

735
00:31:57.701 --> 00:31:58.528
<v ->A weakness.</v>

736
00:31:58.528 --> 00:32:01.938
<v Regina>As a weakness in the Western mind.</v>

737
00:32:02.928 --> 00:32:04.073
<v ->I love nature.</v>

738
00:32:04.073 --> 00:32:06.576
It's interesting to me

739
00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:09.612
to just watch the wind blow a tree.

740
00:32:09.612 --> 00:32:11.580
Now a tree can't move,

741
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.882
and what we don't realize is as human

742
00:32:13.882 --> 00:32:17.187
is without the wind, the tree would never stand,

743
00:32:17.187 --> 00:32:19.522
gravity would pull it to the ground.

744
00:32:19.522 --> 00:32:21.591
And as the wind blows, the tree moves,

745
00:32:21.591 --> 00:32:25.129
and as it moves back and forth in whatever direction

746
00:32:25.129 --> 00:32:27.063
the tree grows and becomes stronger

747
00:32:27.063 --> 00:32:29.399
and then you have the 500-year-old oak tree

748
00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:32.903
that says, "Wind, I will bend no more."

749
00:32:32.903 --> 00:32:36.105
And then the oak tree finds itself lying on the ground.

750
00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:38.008
<v Regina>When it has become too brittle.</v>

751
00:32:38.008 --> 00:32:41.077
<v ->No, it became too stiff, too rigid.</v>

752
00:32:41.077 --> 00:32:44.915
And my point is is when you have a flexible human,

753
00:32:44.915 --> 00:32:47.783
they operate in humility.

754
00:32:47.783 --> 00:32:50.352
And Americans can see humility

755
00:32:50.352 --> 00:32:53.123
in any way that they choose,

756
00:32:53.123 --> 00:32:55.225
but I can make you this promise

757
00:32:55.225 --> 00:32:59.361
that a humble person very seldom encounters difficulty,

758
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:02.765
because they're flexible with it when they do.

759
00:33:02.765 --> 00:33:06.235
The greatest strength comes through that flexibility

760
00:33:06.235 --> 00:33:08.705
to build and move in the wind when it's there.

761
00:33:08.705 --> 00:33:10.774
<v Regina>So is there something almost synonymous, then,</v>

762
00:33:10.774 --> 00:33:14.043
between humility and flexibility?

763
00:33:14.043 --> 00:33:15.345
<v ->To me they're one and the same.</v>

764
00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:18.481
<v Regina>Okay, because that is a very different view</v>

765
00:33:18.481 --> 00:33:20.850
of the genuine essence of humility

766
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.187
compared to, as you said earlier,

767
00:33:23.187 --> 00:33:24.487
what a Westerner might perceive

768
00:33:24.487 --> 00:33:28.509
as, oh, yes, do prostrate yourself before somebody.

769
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:33.062
<v ->Oh I hear you, I admit it, because I was going to ask you</v>

770
00:33:33.062 --> 00:33:34.617
why, you're an American, I mean,

771
00:33:34.617 --> 00:33:36.006
I have so many people say to me,

772
00:33:36.006 --> 00:33:36.997
well you have an Eastern mind,

773
00:33:36.997 --> 00:33:38.634
so how could you know?

774
00:33:38.634 --> 00:33:41.204
They forget that I'm an American.

775
00:33:41.204 --> 00:33:43.040
But what does humility mean to you?

776
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.975
I mean, truly?

777
00:33:44.975 --> 00:33:47.009
<v Regina>Oh, I think before looking at it</v>

778
00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:48.545
through the lens of flexibility,

779
00:33:48.545 --> 00:33:52.149
it simply meant kind of walking through life softly

780
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:55.027
without a particular attachment or judgment

781
00:33:55.027 --> 00:33:57.220
too much and being able to just allow yourself

782
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.889
to be in it, so to speak.

783
00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:00.924
Because if you're brittle and hard,

784
00:34:00.924 --> 00:34:02.526
then you would certainly be knocked off

785
00:34:02.526 --> 00:34:05.494
and encountering resistance after resistance.

786
00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:07.963
So, yeah, I guess it's the same definition,

787
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:09.932
to be able to be that.

788
00:34:09.932 --> 00:34:10.632
<v ->Certainly.</v>

789
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:11.734
<v Regina>So I guess, it's very similar</v>

790
00:34:11.734 --> 00:34:12.801
to what you're describing.

791
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.737
<v ->If you're gonna be resistant,</v>

792
00:34:14.737 --> 00:34:17.073
it doesn't mean the wind is gonna stop blowing.

793
00:34:17.073 --> 00:34:18.776
<v Regina>Right.</v>

794
00:34:18.776 --> 00:34:19.810
<v ->So just move with it.</v>

795
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.043
<v Regina>Yeah, just to move with it.</v>

796
00:34:21.043 --> 00:34:22.879
Yeah, I like the way you've put it in the book,

797
00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:26.415
it added more clarity to my understanding

798
00:34:26.415 --> 00:34:29.252
of the essence of humility.

799
00:34:29.252 --> 00:34:33.422
<v ->If we had humble minds, judgment would be nonexistant.</v>

800
00:34:33.422 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

801
00:34:35.424 --> 00:34:38.729
<v ->Especially if we understand the Creator.</v>

802
00:34:38.729 --> 00:34:42.432
You know, it's astounding to me, Regina,

803
00:34:42.432 --> 00:34:45.035
is science will tell you that there's no two snowflakes

804
00:34:45.035 --> 00:34:47.953
that have ever been alike in the history of the world.

805
00:34:49.272 --> 00:34:50.473
What's my point?

806
00:34:50.473 --> 00:34:52.875
There's been no two humans just alike

807
00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:54.577
in the history of the world.

808
00:34:54.577 --> 00:34:56.812
Our fingerprints tell us that.

809
00:34:56.812 --> 00:34:59.349
And when we don't operate in a humble nature

810
00:34:59.349 --> 00:35:01.551
with each other, then we're going to operate

811
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:04.821
in a resistive, combative nature

812
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:06.922
through the idea of our judgment.

813
00:35:06.922 --> 00:35:09.792
But what gives us the right to think

814
00:35:09.792 --> 00:35:14.164
that somebody isn't attractive because they're heavy,

815
00:35:14.164 --> 00:35:17.635
or because they're short, or because they're tall, or slim?

816
00:35:19.315 --> 00:35:21.905
What's so unattractive about that?

817
00:35:21.905 --> 00:35:23.505
You see, when we place that judgment,

818
00:35:23.505 --> 00:35:25.975
that's one of those mirrors right in front of the person,

819
00:35:25.975 --> 00:35:29.262
right there, saying, you ready for this?

820
00:35:31.681 --> 00:35:34.084
If you see something in another person,

821
00:35:34.084 --> 00:35:36.652
it has to be within you first.

822
00:35:36.652 --> 00:35:38.020
<v Regina>To have the eyes to see it.</v>

823
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.988
<v ->Yes, ma'am.</v>

824
00:35:38.988 --> 00:35:43.459
And that's the rip that most humans have difficulty with.

825
00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:45.728
So when we sit down, we look at that other person

826
00:35:45.728 --> 00:35:48.165
and we think to ourselves, "What a bonehead."

827
00:35:48.165 --> 00:35:50.566
I know I'm about to have my bonehead moment.

828
00:35:50.566 --> 00:35:51.534
Why?

829
00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:52.534
Because I did that.

830
00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:54.036
Or we look at a person, and we say,

831
00:35:54.036 --> 00:35:56.172
"My goodness, they're arrogant."

832
00:35:56.172 --> 00:35:57.573
We don't realize that there's only

833
00:35:57.573 --> 00:35:59.341
one way we could see that.

834
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:02.478
And besides, there's nothing humble about any of that.

835
00:36:02.478 --> 00:36:04.914
Just because it goes unspoken doesn't mean

836
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.183
it doesn't have a karmic return to it.

837
00:36:07.183 --> 00:36:08.017
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

838
00:36:08.017 --> 00:36:09.484
<v ->It doesn't mean that.</v>

839
00:36:09.484 --> 00:36:11.221
It means, once it's thought of,

840
00:36:11.221 --> 00:36:13.889
it's out there, and it's coming.

841
00:36:13.889 --> 00:36:15.391
<v Regina>And I think this is the part</v>

842
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:18.895
that this transparency, when the time comes

843
00:36:18.895 --> 00:36:22.831
where we evolve as a species to the point of transparency,

844
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:25.635
this will be understood much better.

845
00:36:25.635 --> 00:36:27.903
Oftentimes people think, "Well, I didn't do that.

846
00:36:27.903 --> 00:36:29.638
"I know I did the right thing."

847
00:36:29.638 --> 00:36:32.575
But again, discounting where the thoughts may have been

848
00:36:32.575 --> 00:36:36.513
behind that, not understanding that the actual thought

849
00:36:36.513 --> 00:36:39.048
is the precedent sets the precedent

850
00:36:39.048 --> 00:36:42.217
for what's going to follow before the action even.

851
00:36:42.217 --> 00:36:44.220
And so we can have a lot of inconsistency.

852
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.122
Oh, no, I do the right thing,

853
00:36:46.122 --> 00:36:47.857
I give to the right charity,

854
00:36:47.857 --> 00:36:49.092
I do this.

855
00:36:49.092 --> 00:36:49.994
<v ->No judgment there.</v>

856
00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:51.895
<v Regina>Exactly, but this is a lot of times</v>

857
00:36:51.895 --> 00:36:55.131
in the West what happens, is we try to allow our actions

858
00:36:55.131 --> 00:36:57.734
to compensate, really, for what we're not doing inside

859
00:36:57.734 --> 00:36:59.268
between our ears.

860
00:36:59.268 --> 00:37:01.504
<v ->And I think that's an exceptional idea,</v>

861
00:37:01.504 --> 00:37:04.406
and I hope everybody listens to this,

862
00:37:04.406 --> 00:37:07.077
listens to that one more time,

863
00:37:07.077 --> 00:37:09.111
because I'm gonna tell you all something,

864
00:37:09.111 --> 00:37:11.747
if there's one thing that's extremely powerful

865
00:37:11.747 --> 00:37:13.816
about the human, it's our brain.

866
00:37:13.816 --> 00:37:15.185
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

867
00:37:15.185 --> 00:37:17.186
<v ->It's huge, if I might,</v>

868
00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:19.346
maybe diverge on something for a second.

869
00:37:19.346 --> 00:37:20.460
<v Regina>Please.</v>

870
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.526
<v ->I've once heard said in the field of the sciences,</v>

871
00:37:23.526 --> 00:37:27.963
that if you could turn one human brain

872
00:37:27.963 --> 00:37:29.464
into an energy source,

873
00:37:29.464 --> 00:37:31.034
it would run the entire city of New York

874
00:37:31.034 --> 00:37:34.737
for a period of 10 years before one lightbulb would flicker.

875
00:37:34.737 --> 00:37:36.005
<v Regina>Hard to fathom, isn't it?</v>

876
00:37:36.005 --> 00:37:38.175
<v ->Yeah, and another one said</v>

877
00:37:38.175 --> 00:37:40.642
that if you turned it into an explosive device,

878
00:37:40.642 --> 00:37:43.580
it would be equivalent to 100 nuclear devices.

879
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.182
Thank goodness they haven't figured either of those out yet.

880
00:37:46.182 --> 00:37:48.050
<v Regina>And yet we have random thoughts</v>

881
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.620
going every nanosecond, willy-nilly without arcing,

882
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.622
being under, yeah, go ahead.

883
00:37:53.622 --> 00:37:56.626
<v ->And every one of them is creative, all right,</v>

884
00:37:56.626 --> 00:37:58.195
which is why keeping your mind and thoughts

885
00:37:58.195 --> 00:38:00.964
behind your eyes is a huge step to gaining

886
00:38:00.964 --> 00:38:03.098
the empowerment of yourself.

887
00:38:03.098 --> 00:38:04.934
And you are correct in what you say

888
00:38:04.934 --> 00:38:07.771
our mind going willy-nilly,

889
00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:09.772
you can focus it and keep it

890
00:38:09.772 --> 00:38:12.442
on one thing and one thing only.

891
00:38:12.442 --> 00:38:13.609
You know what's scary?

892
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:16.446
It's this thing between our ears makes our decisions,

893
00:38:16.446 --> 00:38:18.914
and yet most of us are not even sure of what it's doing.

894
00:38:18.914 --> 00:38:19.916
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

895
00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:21.567
<v ->Love to ask people,</v>

896
00:38:22.752 --> 00:38:27.691
do you control your mind, or does your mind control you?

897
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:29.292
<v Regina>If we were being honest, almost all of us</v>

898
00:38:29.292 --> 00:38:30.926
would say our mind is controlling us.

899
00:38:30.926 --> 00:38:34.096
It's just repeating loops and patterns from the past.

900
00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:35.365
<v ->That is true.</v>

901
00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:37.266
And now, if everybody heard that one,

902
00:38:37.266 --> 00:38:39.802
they also know why their life circumstances

903
00:38:39.802 --> 00:38:41.807
are exactly the way they are.

904
00:38:41.807 --> 00:38:44.607
And all that the law of humility is attempting to do

905
00:38:44.607 --> 00:38:48.337
is show you what you're repeating so much.

906
00:38:48.337 --> 00:38:50.423
I can remember sitting on the rooftop of...

907
00:38:51.853 --> 00:38:53.983
I believe it was Lovesing, now, and he was talking

908
00:38:53.983 --> 00:38:56.271
with me about my childhood,

909
00:38:56.271 --> 00:38:58.702
and I was asking him about

910
00:38:58.702 --> 00:39:01.858
why did I always have angry relationships with people.

911
00:39:01.858 --> 00:39:05.562
And he looked at me and said, "Honestly, you do not know?"

912
00:39:05.562 --> 00:39:07.596
And I, "No, I don't.

913
00:39:07.596 --> 00:39:11.200
"I like to think of myself as a kind and loving person."

914
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.235
And after he stopped laughing hysterically.

915
00:39:13.235 --> 00:39:14.537
(Regina laughing)

916
00:39:14.537 --> 00:39:16.139
Ben loved to tease us for that.

917
00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:18.441
He let me know that they were drawn to me

918
00:39:18.441 --> 00:39:21.510
because that's who I was.

919
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:25.181
And I, of course, began to master that idea,

920
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:27.483
of not wanting those.

921
00:39:27.483 --> 00:39:30.219
Until today, I met one of the most dynamic, loving ladies

922
00:39:30.219 --> 00:39:33.088
I've ever known, and I know that she has to be

923
00:39:33.088 --> 00:39:35.158
a direct reflection of me.

924
00:39:35.158 --> 00:39:36.493
<v Regina>And that's not where you started,</v>

925
00:39:36.493 --> 00:39:38.661
as we know from our previous times together.

926
00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:39.428
<v ->No it's not.</v>

927
00:39:39.428 --> 00:39:40.830
<v Regina>You started in a very harsh reality</v>

928
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:41.997
where your life was.

929
00:39:41.997 --> 00:39:43.933
Everything was about frustration and anger

930
00:39:43.933 --> 00:39:45.033
that surrounded you.

931
00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:46.718
<v ->And that could've stayed...</v>

932
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.373
had I not gotten the knowledge that I did,

933
00:39:50.373 --> 00:39:52.674
and decided to do something with it.

934
00:39:52.674 --> 00:39:54.410
You see, the power over our own lives,

935
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.479
if we understand the true nature of karma

936
00:39:56.479 --> 00:40:00.483
and what its gifts are, it's something that we can use,

937
00:40:00.483 --> 00:40:04.688
it's a tool that we are in implicit control of,

938
00:40:04.688 --> 00:40:07.991
and can get anything in life that we would ever want.

939
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:12.211
Anything, as long as you understand what it is, one...

940
00:40:13.496 --> 00:40:15.464
knowing what you want,

941
00:40:15.464 --> 00:40:18.367
and then being willing to stay focused

942
00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:21.437
completely on that idea.

943
00:40:21.437 --> 00:40:24.306
Get rid of the element of time

944
00:40:24.306 --> 00:40:26.442
and allow it to come to you,

945
00:40:26.442 --> 00:40:28.779
because any resistant motion or thought

946
00:40:28.779 --> 00:40:32.214
first, what you sow, so shall you reap,

947
00:40:32.214 --> 00:40:34.150
you attract to you what you are,

948
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.982
you're life is showing you what you're attracting to you.

949
00:40:36.982 --> 00:40:37.687
<v Regina>And yours.</v>

950
00:40:37.687 --> 00:40:40.589
<v ->Exactly, and then you step right into the next one,</v>

951
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:41.791
and it's the law of avoidance.

952
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:43.693
You can't avoid you.

953
00:40:43.693 --> 00:40:45.328
There is no way on planet earth,

954
00:40:45.328 --> 00:40:47.697
even though we think we can,

955
00:40:47.697 --> 00:40:49.665
and that's nothing but self-denial.

956
00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:52.335
Oh, Regina, I didn't do that, you made me do it.

957
00:40:52.335 --> 00:40:53.568
<v Regina>(laughs) Yes.</v>

958
00:40:53.568 --> 00:40:55.071
<v ->It's like, yeah, right.</v>

959
00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:56.939
But it's not possible.

960
00:40:56.939 --> 00:40:58.874
We have our own choices.

961
00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:01.759
<v Regina>I think most of us have used that line or--</v>

962
00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:02.311
<v ->A couple times.</v>

963
00:41:02.311 --> 00:41:04.050
<v Regina>Yeah, a time or two in our life.</v>

964
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:04.846
<v ->A thousand.</v>

965
00:41:04.846 --> 00:41:05.914
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

966
00:41:05.914 --> 00:41:07.500
<v ->When I was younger.</v>

967
00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:09.435
It's even down to

968
00:41:09.435 --> 00:41:11.219
when we look at a person and say,

969
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:13.556
"You make me feel this way,"

970
00:41:13.556 --> 00:41:14.640
just a second...

971
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:17.360
who's emotions are those?

972
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.428
Are they not yours?

973
00:41:19.428 --> 00:41:22.165
And if I make you feel a certain way,

974
00:41:22.165 --> 00:41:24.784
wow, who's in control of that moment?

975
00:41:26.078 --> 00:41:27.635
I am.

976
00:41:27.635 --> 00:41:29.138
Love to look at people and say,

977
00:41:29.138 --> 00:41:32.707
"If you look at someone and say, 'You make me so happy,'

978
00:41:32.707 --> 00:41:34.910
"guess what else I can do.

979
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.745
"I can make you extremely sad."

980
00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:37.913
<v Regina>A double-edged sword there.</v>

981
00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:40.149
<v ->Yes, ma'am, there's a double-edged sword in everything.</v>

982
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:44.220
And the beauty of it, Regina, is it's all simply a choice,

983
00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.421
just simply a choice.

984
00:41:45.421 --> 00:41:48.023
What do you choose to have in your life?

985
00:41:48.023 --> 00:41:51.228
You see, you two are gonna be incredibly successful

986
00:41:51.228 --> 00:41:54.196
at some point, not to say that you're not.

987
00:41:54.196 --> 00:41:54.965
Why?

988
00:41:54.965 --> 00:41:56.499
Because everything you're putting out

989
00:41:56.499 --> 00:41:58.300
is pointing in that direction.

990
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.202
And if you look at the simple little road maps

991
00:42:00.202 --> 00:42:01.404
of the reflections of life,

992
00:42:01.404 --> 00:42:04.073
it's putting the appropriate people in front of you.

993
00:42:04.073 --> 00:42:08.177
So now you get into the principle of patience.

994
00:42:08.177 --> 00:42:09.612
<v Regina>Oh yeah, that's the,</v>

995
00:42:09.612 --> 00:42:10.746
you know, I read all those,

996
00:42:10.746 --> 00:42:12.314
that didn't escape me.

997
00:42:12.314 --> 00:42:14.900
Impatience is probably my big...

998
00:42:16.633 --> 00:42:18.220
maybe my most negative...

999
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.289
my best teacher.

1000
00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:21.724
I'm gonna refrain that.

1001
00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:23.659
Impatience is my best teacher.

1002
00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:25.294
<v ->Yes it is.</v>

1003
00:42:25.294 --> 00:42:27.682
Because we are so anti-,

1004
00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:29.431
what's the term in this part of the world,

1005
00:42:29.431 --> 00:42:31.568
anti-climatic or we want it now.

1006
00:42:31.568 --> 00:42:33.302
<v Regina>Yeah, we want instant gratification.</v>

1007
00:42:33.302 --> 00:42:34.430
<v ->Instant gratification.</v>

1008
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.555
Okay, so I want my patience now.

1009
00:42:37.572 --> 00:42:39.009
How's that gonna happen?

1010
00:42:39.009 --> 00:42:40.776
<v Regina>But I remember, I started reflecting</v>

1011
00:42:40.776 --> 00:42:43.579
on how incredibly, what an incredible load

1012
00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:47.684
of arrogance is implicit in being impatient,

1013
00:42:47.684 --> 00:42:50.052
you know, looking at myself it's

1014
00:42:50.052 --> 00:42:53.656
how dare I think that I should be there before someone else,

1015
00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:55.392
for example, if I'm in a hurry.

1016
00:42:55.392 --> 00:42:56.259
<v ->Good for you.</v>

1017
00:42:56.259 --> 00:42:57.626
<v Regina>Yeah, and I'm looking,</v>

1018
00:42:57.626 --> 00:43:00.563
why do I feel I have the right to be in that spot

1019
00:43:00.563 --> 00:43:03.299
or I have the right to move faster than anybody else

1020
00:43:03.299 --> 00:43:04.834
who's in line right ahead of me?

1021
00:43:04.834 --> 00:43:06.068
You know and that kind of thought.

1022
00:43:06.068 --> 00:43:06.802
<v ->Good for you.</v>

1023
00:43:06.802 --> 00:43:10.773
And I mean a heartfelt to be able to realize

1024
00:43:10.773 --> 00:43:14.978
your own arrogance in that dynamic of impatience,

1025
00:43:14.978 --> 00:43:17.509
but it shows up in so many other places,

1026
00:43:17.509 --> 00:43:19.115
like anger,

1027
00:43:20.455 --> 00:43:23.385
the need of control, and that one's obvious,

1028
00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:25.254
but impatience is an absolute beauty

1029
00:43:25.254 --> 00:43:26.822
for you to pick that out of that.

1030
00:43:26.822 --> 00:43:29.725
<v Regina>Well, I find myself becoming impatient</v>

1031
00:43:29.725 --> 00:43:33.862
and then apologizing to people all the time in my mind.

1032
00:43:33.862 --> 00:43:37.032
I mean, a lot of times it'll be on the road, for example,

1033
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:40.602
if I've cut myself off by starting out on a journey

1034
00:43:40.602 --> 00:43:42.939
really with barely time to spare,

1035
00:43:42.939 --> 00:43:45.642
that's my doing, and I certainly get it

1036
00:43:45.642 --> 00:43:48.144
when I'm on the road trying to get around someone,

1037
00:43:48.144 --> 00:43:51.513
I'll be projecting this horrible impatience

1038
00:43:51.513 --> 00:43:53.783
and then inevitably I'll stop myself and say,

1039
00:43:53.783 --> 00:43:56.152
"Get off it, apologize now."

1040
00:43:56.152 --> 00:43:58.521
You know, they're just living their life at their pace.

1041
00:43:58.521 --> 00:44:01.758
And so, yeah, I have a lot of apologizing going on

1042
00:44:01.758 --> 00:44:04.760
in my head when I'm out there acting impatiently

1043
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.095
in the world, no doubt.

1044
00:44:06.095 --> 00:44:08.764
<v ->My lovely bride can tell you that when I'm driving a car</v>

1045
00:44:08.764 --> 00:44:12.778
it's, I get more go lights than I do stop lights.

1046
00:44:12.778 --> 00:44:14.937
<v Regina>Mm-hmm, because you're patient.</v>

1047
00:44:14.937 --> 00:44:16.639
<v ->Yeah, and I'm just not in a hurry.</v>

1048
00:44:16.639 --> 00:44:18.107
<v Regina>And I notice that, too when I--</v>

1049
00:44:18.107 --> 00:44:20.142
<v ->It doesn't mean that I don't drive very fast.</v>

1050
00:44:20.142 --> 00:44:21.510
<v Regina>Yeah, that's different,</v>

1051
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.778
that's a whole separate subject.

1052
00:44:22.778 --> 00:44:24.046
<v ->No, it's just</v>

1053
00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:25.481
there's no such thing,

1054
00:44:25.481 --> 00:44:27.182
I just don't see them.

1055
00:44:28.562 --> 00:44:32.054
And, again, that's karma in motion.

1056
00:44:32.054 --> 00:44:35.458
<v Regina>Actually that's a very good point you bring up.</v>

1057
00:44:35.458 --> 00:44:37.359
Every now and then there'll be something going on

1058
00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:38.694
where it's I need to take care

1059
00:44:38.694 --> 00:44:40.329
of that thing while I'm driving.

1060
00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:41.763
Of course, I'm not gonna pull over.

1061
00:44:41.763 --> 00:44:44.734
Whatever it is, maybe I have to dial a number,

1062
00:44:44.734 --> 00:44:47.135
which is you can't do that in the state of California,

1063
00:44:47.135 --> 00:44:48.671
it's illegal so your phone.

1064
00:44:48.671 --> 00:44:50.162
Now you have to hide what you're doing.

1065
00:44:50.162 --> 00:44:52.175
Before I'd just put it up above the dash,

1066
00:44:52.175 --> 00:44:54.224
and dial so I could still see what's going on.

1067
00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:55.477
It's much more dangerous now,

1068
00:44:55.477 --> 00:44:57.345
because I'll sneak a phone call in,

1069
00:44:57.345 --> 00:45:01.784
and try to dial something down below eye-level

1070
00:45:01.784 --> 00:45:03.852
of the roads, and I know that it's stupid,

1071
00:45:03.852 --> 00:45:06.354
but that it's impatient,

1072
00:45:06.354 --> 00:45:09.759
but when I need for those red lights to happen,

1073
00:45:09.759 --> 00:45:11.413
so I can just stop and do it,

1074
00:45:11.413 --> 00:45:12.578
it will not happen.

1075
00:45:12.578 --> 00:45:13.788
<v ->Of course not.</v>

1076
00:45:13.788 --> 00:45:16.197
<v Regina>It never ceases to amaze me,</v>

1077
00:45:16.197 --> 00:45:20.403
it's all green when I need to do this impatient thing now.

1078
00:45:20.403 --> 00:45:22.003
<v ->But the root behind that is the fact</v>

1079
00:45:22.003 --> 00:45:23.639
that you already know subconsciously

1080
00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:27.977
that you are doing something that is inappropriate.

1081
00:45:27.977 --> 00:45:28.677
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1082
00:45:28.677 --> 00:45:30.012
<v ->So the light is gonna make sure</v>

1083
00:45:30.012 --> 00:45:32.781
that you have inappropriate time to do it,

1084
00:45:32.781 --> 00:45:35.317
because that's exactly what it's giving you.

1085
00:45:35.317 --> 00:45:36.952
<v Regina>I always marvel at the beauty of that</v>

1086
00:45:36.952 --> 00:45:38.553
and how it plays out.

1087
00:45:38.553 --> 00:45:40.789
<v ->See to me, there's only harmony,</v>

1088
00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:43.659
and the idea of karma shows it to you.

1089
00:45:43.659 --> 00:45:45.160
And the question is whether you choose

1090
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.799
to accept it, because there is only harmony

1091
00:45:48.799 --> 00:45:53.502
until a disharmonious human enters in,

1092
00:45:53.502 --> 00:45:55.871
and there's just a natural rhythm to life.

1093
00:45:55.871 --> 00:45:58.206
So it already knows you're attempting to do something

1094
00:45:58.206 --> 00:45:59.941
that's inappropriate, so it's gonna make sure

1095
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:01.744
that you have inappropriate time

1096
00:46:01.744 --> 00:46:03.245
to do an inappropriate thing.

1097
00:46:03.245 --> 00:46:04.747
<v Regina>It works every time.</v>

1098
00:46:04.747 --> 00:46:05.949
<v ->Absolutely it will.</v>

1099
00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:08.150
I don't care what it is and what it's on,

1100
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.486
it's always gonna give you the same thing back to you.

1101
00:46:10.486 --> 00:46:12.455
<v Regina>I love the return on it.</v>

1102
00:46:12.455 --> 00:46:14.857
Okay, let's talk about the eighth law of karma,

1103
00:46:14.857 --> 00:46:17.627
the principle of willingness.

1104
00:46:17.627 --> 00:46:19.428
That's an interesting one.

1105
00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:20.915
<v ->Um,</v>

1106
00:46:20.915 --> 00:46:22.765
let's just say that it revolves

1107
00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:26.017
more about no complaints.

1108
00:46:27.836 --> 00:46:31.858
It's just simply about willing to be who you are...

1109
00:46:32.808 --> 00:46:34.477
at all moments.
<v Regina>Authentically.</v>

1110
00:46:35.527 --> 00:46:37.013
Well, that's the only way you can be, I guess,

1111
00:46:37.013 --> 00:46:39.048
is you are or you aren't you.

1112
00:46:39.048 --> 00:46:40.882
<v ->No, you are you no matter</v>

1113
00:46:40.882 --> 00:46:43.319
what you think you are at that moment.

1114
00:46:43.319 --> 00:46:47.590
It's, the law of willingness is establishing

1115
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:50.459
and realizing the harmony and recognizing the harmony

1116
00:46:50.459 --> 00:46:53.128
even within your own self about who you are,

1117
00:46:53.128 --> 00:46:56.245
and what you yourself are all about.

1118
00:46:56.245 --> 00:46:58.400
Love the way Bruce Lee said it.

1119
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.235
Water, if you put water in a cup

1120
00:47:00.235 --> 00:47:01.605
it takes the shape of the cup.

1121
00:47:01.605 --> 00:47:02.838
If you put water in a glass,

1122
00:47:02.838 --> 00:47:04.172
it takes the shape of glass,

1123
00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:05.274
and, of course, you put it in a bowl,

1124
00:47:05.274 --> 00:47:06.409
your puppies will appreciate it,

1125
00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:08.811
because it takes the shape of the bowl.

1126
00:47:08.811 --> 00:47:10.045
We are the same way.

1127
00:47:10.045 --> 00:47:13.711
But what we do is we end up being unwilling,

1128
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:17.219
let's say, to be a loving, kind person,

1129
00:47:17.219 --> 00:47:19.956
or even being patient in that moment.

1130
00:47:19.956 --> 00:47:23.559
It's just, goes back to the notion of acceptance.

1131
00:47:23.559 --> 00:47:26.862
And the idea of the law of willingness is just we're willing

1132
00:47:26.862 --> 00:47:28.730
to go with whatever is there.

1133
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.533
And now we're back to the idea of the tree, again,

1134
00:47:31.533 --> 00:47:34.604
and the wind blowing, because the truth is

1135
00:47:34.604 --> 00:47:38.874
the way we change our outer world

1136
00:47:38.874 --> 00:47:41.710
is through our inner self.

1137
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.981
And that's where the real power of the human lies.

1138
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:48.584
And we have to actually be willing to work with that,

1139
00:47:48.584 --> 00:47:50.632
so that we can accomplish that.

1140
00:47:50.632 --> 00:47:52.655
<v Regina>One of the subtexts in that particular one</v>

1141
00:47:52.655 --> 00:47:55.257
talks about, you talked about truth a moment ago,

1142
00:47:55.257 --> 00:47:57.593
personal truth versus universal truth.

1143
00:47:57.593 --> 00:47:58.977
<v ->Hmm.</v>

1144
00:47:59.661 --> 00:48:00.529
When somebody says,

1145
00:48:00.529 --> 00:48:03.666
"Now, let me tell you my personal truth,"

1146
00:48:03.666 --> 00:48:06.501
you're about to hear an ego barking,

1147
00:48:06.501 --> 00:48:07.802
because what they're gonna tell you

1148
00:48:07.802 --> 00:48:08.937
is what they've limited

1149
00:48:08.937 --> 00:48:11.606
an otherwise universal principle to,

1150
00:48:11.606 --> 00:48:13.809
to their scope of understanding.

1151
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:17.745
If I were to look at you and ask you a ludicrous question

1152
00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:20.648
like, where's the center of infinity?

1153
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:21.450
What would you say?

1154
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:22.951
<v Regina>I'd have a blank screen.</v>

1155
00:48:22.951 --> 00:48:24.319
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1156
00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:27.623
So why is science looking for the center of infinity,

1157
00:48:27.623 --> 00:48:30.192
when they already know right off the bat that doesn't exist?

1158
00:48:30.192 --> 00:48:30.993
What's my point?

1159
00:48:30.993 --> 00:48:32.262
That's a universal truth.

1160
00:48:32.262 --> 00:48:35.030
A universal truth is very obvious in itself,

1161
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:39.741
but what people will do, is they will take a universal truth

1162
00:48:39.741 --> 00:48:43.022
which, by the way, is a way to tell them, is...

1163
00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:47.576
that that universal truth will fit anywhere.

1164
00:48:47.576 --> 00:48:48.811
It has to.

1165
00:48:48.811 --> 00:48:50.745
But a personal truth won't.

1166
00:48:50.745 --> 00:48:51.896
In fact...

1167
00:48:53.215 --> 00:48:56.819
the way the principle actually reads is to this effect:

1168
00:48:56.819 --> 00:49:00.122
That whatever you believe something to be true,

1169
00:49:00.122 --> 00:49:01.230
then you must be willing

1170
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.859
to demonstrate that truth, all right?

1171
00:49:03.859 --> 00:49:07.396
Now, what do we do when we think something is true

1172
00:49:07.396 --> 00:49:10.632
and we go to demonstrate it, and it doesn't work?

1173
00:49:10.632 --> 00:49:12.334
Don't we begin to fight it?

1174
00:49:12.334 --> 00:49:13.303
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

1175
00:49:13.303 --> 00:49:15.403
<v ->So the idea of the law of willingness</v>

1176
00:49:15.403 --> 00:49:19.708
is as you grow and shift, what you deem as truth now

1177
00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:22.712
is not what you deemed as truth 10 years ago.

1178
00:49:22.712 --> 00:49:23.912
It's totally different.

1179
00:49:23.912 --> 00:49:25.814
And you've been absolutely willing

1180
00:49:25.814 --> 00:49:27.816
to shift and change with it.

1181
00:49:27.816 --> 00:49:30.652
So, if a truth doesn't work, in essence,

1182
00:49:30.652 --> 00:49:34.457
now it's time to shift your personal perspective on that.

1183
00:49:34.457 --> 00:49:36.292
But if a person is gonna look for truth,

1184
00:49:36.292 --> 00:49:38.727
look for universal truth.

1185
00:49:38.727 --> 00:49:40.562
<v Regina>Rather than the kind that says,</v>

1186
00:49:40.562 --> 00:49:42.898
"I do it this way because that's how I've always done it,

1187
00:49:42.898 --> 00:49:44.399
"that's how my family did it before me,

1188
00:49:44.399 --> 00:49:46.602
"my dad always did it that way."

1189
00:49:46.602 --> 00:49:48.030
That's what you call a personal truth.

1190
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.571
<v ->Yeah, um.</v>

1191
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:50.572
I don't know if you read

1192
00:49:50.572 --> 00:49:52.591
the story in there about the shoe,

1193
00:49:52.591 --> 00:49:54.576
when one of my teachers looked at me and said,

1194
00:49:54.576 --> 00:49:56.812
"You know, man, do you always put your right shoe on first?"

1195
00:49:56.812 --> 00:49:59.082
And I said, "Yes, I do."

1196
00:49:59.082 --> 00:50:00.059
And he said, "Why?"

1197
00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:02.485
I said, "Well, my mom taught me that.

1198
00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:04.820
"And I've been doing it that way all of my life."

1199
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.322
He said, "Take your shoes off."

1200
00:50:06.322 --> 00:50:07.223
So I took them off.

1201
00:50:07.223 --> 00:50:10.125
I was getting ready to go run, so they were tennis shoes.

1202
00:50:10.125 --> 00:50:11.159
So I took them off.

1203
00:50:11.159 --> 00:50:12.861
And he said, "Now, put your left one on first,"

1204
00:50:12.861 --> 00:50:15.063
keeping in mind that I never done that,

1205
00:50:15.063 --> 00:50:17.332
and about 23, 24 years old,

1206
00:50:17.332 --> 00:50:19.267
I had never in my life had done that.

1207
00:50:19.267 --> 00:50:22.273
So I sat down on this little three-legged stool,

1208
00:50:22.273 --> 00:50:25.307
and I picked up the left shoe.

1209
00:50:25.307 --> 00:50:28.543
I went to put it on and, Regina, I fell on the floor,

1210
00:50:28.543 --> 00:50:30.513
'cause I'd never done it.

1211
00:50:30.513 --> 00:50:32.815
So, when somebody says, "My dad did it,

1212
00:50:32.815 --> 00:50:34.883
"my mom did it, my grandfather did it,

1213
00:50:34.883 --> 00:50:37.353
"so, therefore, I'm gonna do it,"

1214
00:50:37.353 --> 00:50:40.722
okay, no, you are simply repeating

1215
00:50:40.722 --> 00:50:43.225
other people's cycles and living your life

1216
00:50:43.225 --> 00:50:44.593
the way that they have.

1217
00:50:44.593 --> 00:50:45.861
<v Regina>And you bring a really good point up,</v>

1218
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:47.930
because to start breaking these cycles,

1219
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.232
it can be something as simple as recognizing

1220
00:50:50.232 --> 00:50:52.535
an ingrained pattern like you say,

1221
00:50:52.535 --> 00:50:54.470
putting the other shoe on first.

1222
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.139
<v ->And more will go on up here,</v>

1223
00:50:56.139 --> 00:50:57.773
than they ever do out there.

1224
00:50:57.773 --> 00:51:01.643
But if we begin working with our own mind

1225
00:51:01.643 --> 00:51:03.746
as an example, say, you're in a situation

1226
00:51:03.746 --> 00:51:05.847
where you usually become impatient,

1227
00:51:05.847 --> 00:51:07.616
okay, it's fine, become impatient,

1228
00:51:07.616 --> 00:51:09.251
catch it, recognize it, realize it.

1229
00:51:09.251 --> 00:51:11.486
Next time that same situation comes up,

1230
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:13.388
if you keep working at it, there's gonna come a point

1231
00:51:13.388 --> 00:51:15.191
where you're gonna find yourself in a situation

1232
00:51:15.191 --> 00:51:18.126
where you ordinarily become impatient,

1233
00:51:18.126 --> 00:51:19.361
well now you're not.

1234
00:51:19.361 --> 00:51:20.295
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1235
00:51:20.295 --> 00:51:21.263
<v ->That's the progression.</v>

1236
00:51:21.263 --> 00:51:22.298
That's how it works.

1237
00:51:22.298 --> 00:51:25.700
And the law of willingness is also, you could say,

1238
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.270
is working with your own routines of mind.

1239
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.140
I love to share with people that the only habits

1240
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.608
in this world nuns wear.

1241
00:51:32.608 --> 00:51:34.376
If you're not a nun, then you don't belong in a habit.

1242
00:51:34.376 --> 00:51:35.544
<v Regina>Then you don't need any.</v>

1243
00:51:35.544 --> 00:51:36.713
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1244
00:51:36.713 --> 00:51:38.375
<v Regina>What about the 10th law of karma,</v>

1245
00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:39.414
the principle of change.

1246
00:51:39.414 --> 00:51:41.386
This one scares a lot of people.

1247
00:51:42.736 --> 00:51:43.885
<v ->It actually reads this way.</v>

1248
00:51:43.885 --> 00:51:44.797
And I can remember the day

1249
00:51:44.797 --> 00:51:46.939
that Khi Ellis threw it at me.

1250
00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:51.527
(speaks foreign language)

1251
00:51:51.527 --> 00:51:53.312
How did he actually put it?

1252
00:51:53.628 --> 00:51:55.096
The more things change,

1253
00:51:55.096 --> 00:51:58.384
the more they seem to stay the same.

1254
00:52:01.337 --> 00:52:03.739
And I looked really puzzled,

1255
00:52:03.739 --> 00:52:07.226
If things change, how can they remain the same?

1256
00:52:08.143 --> 00:52:09.511
And then he began to instruct me

1257
00:52:09.511 --> 00:52:11.547
on all the wrestling matches that we do,

1258
00:52:11.547 --> 00:52:13.215
it's like a little analogy I gave you

1259
00:52:13.215 --> 00:52:15.751
with the idea of the shoe.

1260
00:52:15.751 --> 00:52:17.185
They put me in a scenario

1261
00:52:17.185 --> 00:52:20.889
that things they knew had to change.

1262
00:52:20.889 --> 00:52:24.626
And in my routines and my own mind had to change,

1263
00:52:24.626 --> 00:52:27.796
because you see, if you attempt to change

1264
00:52:27.796 --> 00:52:32.233
everything outside you, they stay the same,

1265
00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:34.503
because the person that attempted to create the change

1266
00:52:34.503 --> 00:52:37.939
is outside themselves is still the same.

1267
00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:41.443
So, the object in this one principle of karma is this,

1268
00:52:41.443 --> 00:52:43.011
there's a perfect example,

1269
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:45.213
if you would like that abundance in your life,

1270
00:52:45.213 --> 00:52:48.284
then change your locked consciousness into it.

1271
00:52:48.284 --> 00:52:53.239
But because if you don't, it will remain the same.

1272
00:52:53.239 --> 00:52:56.191
Because internally, that individual is still based

1273
00:52:56.191 --> 00:52:57.993
in locked consciousness.

1274
00:52:57.993 --> 00:52:59.114
<v Regina>So we have to have the courage</v>

1275
00:52:59.114 --> 00:53:04.086
to really employ the new feelings,

1276
00:53:04.086 --> 00:53:06.601
the new thoughts, the new understandings,

1277
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:09.471
we have to employ them to create genuine change.

1278
00:53:09.471 --> 00:53:12.874
We have to recognize, I assume recognize, first of all,

1279
00:53:12.874 --> 00:53:14.419
what our patterns are.

1280
00:53:14.419 --> 00:53:15.744
<v ->Absolutely, I mean if you don't,</v>

1281
00:53:15.744 --> 00:53:16.945
that goes back to the mirrors.

1282
00:53:16.945 --> 00:53:19.481
The mirrors are gonna show you what your patterns are.

1283
00:53:19.481 --> 00:53:21.350
And then it's not that,

1284
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:23.484
I mean, you have to assume personal responsibility

1285
00:53:23.484 --> 00:53:26.989
and accept the fact that you're the one who created that.

1286
00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:28.956
Then once you accept the fact that you created it,

1287
00:53:28.956 --> 00:53:30.859
the least you have is a modicum

1288
00:53:30.859 --> 00:53:35.297
of realization of reaching the change.

1289
00:53:35.297 --> 00:53:39.234
People don't like change because they're less than graceful.

1290
00:53:39.234 --> 00:53:41.470
It comes to that idea of change.

1291
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:45.406
And the other thing is is what they knew, now is not.

1292
00:53:45.406 --> 00:53:48.143
We want newness, but yet at the same time,

1293
00:53:48.143 --> 00:53:50.479
we have difficulty stepping into that arena

1294
00:53:50.479 --> 00:53:54.533
because we're going from a known into an unknown.

1295
00:53:56.151 --> 00:53:57.986
Even if everybody watching the video

1296
00:53:57.986 --> 00:53:59.223
looked back in our lives,

1297
00:53:59.223 --> 00:54:03.941
and every time a relationship ended, it hurt.

1298
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.029
We didn't want to let it go.

1299
00:54:07.029 --> 00:54:08.630
But yet the very next relationship

1300
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:11.967
that came into life, it was better.

1301
00:54:11.967 --> 00:54:13.671
So the newness.

1302
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:15.904
When we are stepping into change,

1303
00:54:15.904 --> 00:54:18.931
we should always learn to release implicitly

1304
00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:20.675
what the old one was.

1305
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:25.181
And there's also the struggle for us human to doing that.

1306
00:54:25.181 --> 00:54:27.415
We like our routines.

1307
00:54:27.415 --> 00:54:30.085
We like the same old cycles.

1308
00:54:30.085 --> 00:54:32.788
And yet most people would say, "No, I don't.

1309
00:54:32.788 --> 00:54:34.589
"I don't want this to change."

1310
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:36.825
Then do something.

1311
00:54:36.825 --> 00:54:38.694
"What, what do you want me to do?"

1312
00:54:38.694 --> 00:54:41.296
How about be patient versus impatient?

1313
00:54:41.296 --> 00:54:42.830
Just as an example.

1314
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:47.619
How about see yourself as abundant versus lack?

1315
00:54:48.737 --> 00:54:52.006
How about see yourself as loving and kind?

1316
00:54:52.006 --> 00:54:54.776
How about seeing yourself as compassionate?

1317
00:54:54.776 --> 00:54:56.678
How about seeing yourself

1318
00:54:56.678 --> 00:54:59.031
the way you want yourself to become?

1319
00:55:00.716 --> 00:55:03.384
When you do, then the law of change

1320
00:55:03.384 --> 00:55:06.355
can actually come into play for that person.

1321
00:55:06.355 --> 00:55:09.657
And until they do that, it cannot.

1322
00:55:09.657 --> 00:55:12.126
<v Regina>There we go back to personal responsibility.</v>

1323
00:55:12.126 --> 00:55:13.795
<v ->What you sow, so shall you reap.</v>

1324
00:55:13.795 --> 00:55:14.562
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

1325
00:55:14.562 --> 00:55:17.599
So we've really barely touched on

1326
00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:19.534
and hopscotched through because everyone

1327
00:55:19.534 --> 00:55:22.370
certainly can pick up a copy of the book

1328
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:25.106
and then take themselves through in their own time.

1329
00:55:25.106 --> 00:55:27.242
I wanted to get to that part of it,

1330
00:55:27.242 --> 00:55:30.245
you, this book is not one you read.

1331
00:55:30.245 --> 00:55:31.947
We started the conversation this way.

1332
00:55:31.947 --> 00:55:34.637
You don't read this book, you live with it.

1333
00:55:34.637 --> 00:55:38.220
And you employ these various concepts

1334
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.689
if you so choose.

1335
00:55:40.689 --> 00:55:44.327
How do you suggest a person best utilize the book?

1336
00:55:44.327 --> 00:55:47.228
They've been, they picked one up, or they've been given one

1337
00:55:47.228 --> 00:55:49.798
for their birthday or Christmas present, or something.

1338
00:55:49.798 --> 00:55:53.068
<v ->I would say first off, approach it honestly,</v>

1339
00:55:53.068 --> 00:55:54.903
because it's very genuine,

1340
00:55:54.903 --> 00:55:56.806
based on actually experience,

1341
00:55:56.806 --> 00:56:00.308
ancient teachings which predate the Buddha,

1342
00:56:00.308 --> 00:56:02.510
and every monk who's taught them,

1343
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:06.115
and most people don't want to go into a monastery.

1344
00:56:06.115 --> 00:56:09.017
These chapters in this book and the words

1345
00:56:09.017 --> 00:56:10.885
are more like living words,

1346
00:56:10.885 --> 00:56:12.521
they're a thing to live by,

1347
00:56:12.521 --> 00:56:14.657
it's not something to think about.

1348
00:56:14.657 --> 00:56:15.891
My first suggestion to people

1349
00:56:15.891 --> 00:56:18.694
is read it all the way through.

1350
00:56:18.694 --> 00:56:22.663
Just go from page one to page whatever.

1351
00:56:22.663 --> 00:56:25.233
And after you've done that, now go back

1352
00:56:25.233 --> 00:56:28.537
and read one chapter a time.

1353
00:56:28.537 --> 00:56:32.741
Read one principle at a time and practice it.

1354
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:34.876
And literally practice it.

1355
00:56:34.876 --> 00:56:36.077
And what you'll see is

1356
00:56:36.077 --> 00:56:38.714
by the time you hit the 12th principle,

1357
00:56:38.714 --> 00:56:42.917
should you choose to be a different person,

1358
00:56:42.917 --> 00:56:44.587
you would be.

1359
00:56:44.587 --> 00:56:47.889
<v Regina>I would certainly say that would be true.</v>

1360
00:56:47.889 --> 00:56:49.391
<v ->Because that's what it's designed to do.</v>

1361
00:56:49.391 --> 00:56:50.279
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1362
00:56:50.279 --> 00:56:52.794
<v ->It's not something that you read and just stick on a shelf</v>

1363
00:56:52.794 --> 00:56:55.531
that was never my intention even though I already know

1364
00:56:55.531 --> 00:56:56.966
that a lot of people are gonna read it,

1365
00:56:56.966 --> 00:56:58.567
they're gonna do just that.

1366
00:56:58.567 --> 00:57:01.302
But they miss the idea, they miss the beauty

1367
00:57:01.302 --> 00:57:03.672
of what karma's all about.

1368
00:57:03.672 --> 00:57:07.276
It's a tool, so that you, I, or any human

1369
00:57:07.276 --> 00:57:11.813
can create their life in whatever manner that they choose.

1370
00:57:11.813 --> 00:57:15.283
Here's the funny thing as I shared from the beginning.

1371
00:57:15.283 --> 00:57:16.918
We do that anyway.

1372
00:57:16.918 --> 00:57:19.788
But it'd be nice to know how to drive the vehicle

1373
00:57:19.788 --> 00:57:22.156
before you get in it and start driving it.

1374
00:57:22.156 --> 00:57:24.875
And even in our age, we may think that we do.

1375
00:57:25.827 --> 00:57:29.097
I can assure you, doubtful.

1376
00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:33.001
If you truly knew the power of you,

1377
00:57:33.001 --> 00:57:35.037
and how to use it,

1378
00:57:35.037 --> 00:57:37.772
would you pick it up and use it?

1379
00:57:37.772 --> 00:57:40.075
If you would, then you have the greatest gift

1380
00:57:40.075 --> 00:57:42.010
that could ever be given.

1381
00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:45.848
So if people want to really realize

1382
00:57:45.848 --> 00:57:48.250
I would suggest the 12 Sacred Principles of Karma

1383
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:49.851
is well worth the read.

1384
00:57:49.851 --> 00:57:52.287
<v Regina>I'd say, I'd say that</v>

1385
00:57:52.287 --> 00:57:54.456
if everybody were issued a few books at birth,

1386
00:57:54.456 --> 00:57:57.760
just a handful, and they were very carefully selected,

1387
00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.595
I think that would be one, certainly for the Western mind.

1388
00:58:00.595 --> 00:58:02.231
Now there might be an equivalent,

1389
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:04.232
many equivalents in the East,

1390
00:58:04.232 --> 00:58:07.035
but with the direct teachings from the Eastern perspective,

1391
00:58:07.035 --> 00:58:10.473
but from a Western person in our mindset,

1392
00:58:10.473 --> 00:58:12.840
I think it's beautifully articulated

1393
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.190
and it is a living entity.

1394
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.157
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1395
00:58:16.157 --> 00:58:17.245
<v Regina>Yes, well thank you.</v>

1396
00:58:17.245 --> 00:58:18.550
<v ->That's kind words.</v>

1397
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.181
<v Regina>Thank you for writing that book,</v>

1398
00:58:20.181 --> 00:58:21.182
and thank you for being here with us.

1399
00:58:21.182 --> 00:58:22.784
And we're going to get back together again

1400
00:58:22.784 --> 00:58:25.453
because we were speaking before this interview upstairs

1401
00:58:25.453 --> 00:58:27.289
and thought, why didn't we have the camera rolling

1402
00:58:27.289 --> 00:58:29.490
there is so much to talk about.

1403
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.527
So until next time, thank you so much.

1404
00:58:31.527 --> 00:58:32.943
<v ->My pleasure. (music drowns out voice)</v>

1405
00:58:35.063 --> 00:58:37.866
<v ->To pick up a copy of this lovely life guide,</v>

1406
00:58:37.866 --> 00:58:40.002
the 12 Sacred Principles of Karma,

1407
00:58:40.002 --> 00:58:42.838
order through Amazon or any other major book seller.

1408
00:58:42.838 --> 00:58:46.674
Then, take your time and use it as a loving companion.

1409
00:58:46.674 --> 00:58:48.810
Meanwhile, to learn more about Steven's background

1410
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.924
you can watch our first two interviews with him.

1411
00:58:50.924 --> 00:58:53.264
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
