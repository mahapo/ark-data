00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:04.045
(theme music plays)

2
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.823
<v ->Homeopathy can best be described in Quantum terms,</v>

3
00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:17.642
and it's effectiveness is profound.

4
00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.522
I only recently began experimenting with homeopathic

5
00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:22.290
remedies and was so impressed,

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.787
that I felt the time was right and the place was right

7
00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:27.674
to do an interview with a well known homeopath in England,

8
00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:29.001
Henrietta Wells.

9
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.262
Part of the motivation is also that autumn is upon us

10
00:00:31.262 --> 00:00:33.897
and this is when the establishment begins urging us all

11
00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:35.918
to get a vaccine for the seasonal flu.

12
00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:38.440
Henrietta says flu can easily be handled

13
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.168
with homeopathic remedies,

14
00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:42.557
and wrote a book a few years back addressing this called

15
00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:44.502
"Bird Flu: Are You Prepared?"

16
00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:46.673
though it covers all types of flu.

17
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:47.985
(music plays)

18
00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:02.643
Henrietta, I'm so glad we had a chance to meet with you

19
00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:04.966
because I'e just started dabbling with Homeopathy,

20
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.268
it's not very popular,

21
00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:08.974
commonly speaking in the United States yet

22
00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:10.451
for reasons I, well,

23
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:11.848
we do know why,

24
00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.802
but it's so powerful and when I'd heard about you

25
00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.379
and your reputation in England I thought,

26
00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:18.188
"we have to get an interview with you,"

27
00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:20.500
so you can begin, just in the nick of time

28
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.772
before flu season among other things,

29
00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:26.989
cluing us into the principles that work behind homeopathy,

30
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:28.831
and if we could just start with

31
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.143
a little bit of that to begin with and then go into,

32
00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:34.496
the Hahnemann and how it was developed in modern times,

33
00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:36.241
that would be wonderful just basically

34
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.344
starting with the principle.

35
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.879
<v Henrietta>Well, the main principal with homeopathy</v>

36
00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:45.281
is that a remedy or a substance

37
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:47.335
that is tested on healthy people

38
00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:49.107
will produce certain symptoms,

39
00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:51.562
and that picture of symptoms,

40
00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:53.512
if you come across identical picture of symptoms

41
00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.165
in a sick person,

42
00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:57.195
it will cure that sick person.

43
00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.341
If it's a different picture of symptoms, it wont.

44
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:02.203
And the word literally means

45
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:07.497
treating like and similar suffering, hoemopathy.

46
00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:13.547
All these remedies are tested originally on people,

47
00:02:13.547 --> 00:02:16.405
never on animals I might as well add,

48
00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.789
and the symptoms

49
00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:23.042
in great detail are noted down

50
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.045
and you get all these remedy pictures,

51
00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:30.285
and, when you have a sick person

52
00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.582
matching one of those remedy pictures,

53
00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:36.420
then that remedy will cure that person.

54
00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:40.111
And if you give the wrong remedy it won't.

55
00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:42.503
It means a similar remedy,

56
00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:45.072
conventional medicine uses opposing remedies,

57
00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:49.221
and this argument has gone on for centuries literally,

58
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:50.527
from Hippocrates,

59
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:56.151
and for many centuries been argued about

60
00:02:57.348 --> 00:03:00.472
whether you should use similar or opposing remedies,

61
00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:05.522
but that is very seldom mentioned in any media interview

62
00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:07.879
on what homeopathy is all about.

63
00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.724
In fact usually all they talk about is potencies,

64
00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.942
and the fact that they said there's nothing there

65
00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.093
which caused a raise, and (other speaker interrupts) yeah,

66
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:20.876
but, I think there was an interview last week in Scotland,

67
00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:25.363
three or four people all being interviewed

68
00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:28.456
on homeopathy and whether it worked or not,

69
00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:33.175
and nobody once mentioned similar remedies..

70
00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:34.622
<v Interviewer>That's interesting, even I know that.</v>

71
00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:36.003
<v ->in the whole program.</v>

72
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.626
<v Interviewer>Interesting.</v>

73
00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:38.233
<v ->It wasn't mentioned once and that is</v>

74
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:39.746
the essence of homeopathy,

75
00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:42.582
and without that you do not have homeopathy.

76
00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:44.027
<v Interviewer>And this has even been reflected</v>

77
00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:45.574
in Allopathic medicine,

78
00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:47.860
for example the use of Digitalis.

79
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.433
People don't understand that

80
00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:52.103
that is more along the like (other speaker interrupts)

81
00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:55.607
<v ->Well sort of, Digitalis is a..</v>

82
00:03:56.058 --> 00:03:57.368
Has been proved homeopathically,

83
00:03:57.368 --> 00:04:00.035
and one of the key modalities of it

84
00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.350
when you're using it as a homeopathic remedy,

85
00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:06.667
and in our proving of this remedy is the fact that

86
00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:08.852
when somebody's got heart disease and they're weak

87
00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:10.964
and they're suffering and their heart is

88
00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:14.340
beating irregularly or very violently or something,

89
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.725
it is said they want to sit dead still, they do not move.

90
00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.409
You don't find them pacing up and down

91
00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.118
or anything like that which you do with other remedies,

92
00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:24.209
with digitalis they sit dead still,

93
00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:26.926
and if they sit dead still

94
00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:29.882
then digitalis is our remedy.

95
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.209
When doctors prescribe digitalis they have no idea

96
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.729
about this,

97
00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.065
they just know that some people with heart disease

98
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:37.637
benefit from digitalis.

99
00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:38.728
<v Interviewer>But they don't understand</v>

100
00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:39.230
the underlying principal?

101
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.037
<v Henrietta>They have no idea what they're doing,</v>

102
00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:41.493
absolutely no idea whatsoever.

103
00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:43.125
<v Interviewer>And that has to do with the way</v>

104
00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:46.715
the homeopath becomes familiar with their patient.

105
00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:47.531
I mean this isn't..

106
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:51.152
<v ->When you take a case homeopathic</v>

107
00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:55.625
the first consultation takes at least two hours

108
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:56.995
to do properly,

109
00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.788
and you take an extraordinary amount of detail about people,

110
00:05:00.788 --> 00:05:02.685
and if somebody has come to you with heart disease

111
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:04.987
you ask all sorts of questions about when the heart

112
00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:07.501
does this and how they feel about that,

113
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.318
and one of the things they may or may not say

114
00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:13.046
is that when their heart's terrible they have to sit down,

115
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.585
they can't move, they can hardly talk and so on,

116
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:17.857
and then you think "Ah, yeah, digitalis."

117
00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:19.798
You know, as if they said

118
00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:21.913
"I have to keep moving or I think my heart will stop

119
00:05:21.913 --> 00:05:23.011
when it's chill send me home."

120
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:25.218
You know, and it's all these different things,

121
00:05:25.218 --> 00:05:27.447
build up a picture and

122
00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:30.929
get the right picture, get the right remedy, you're there.

123
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.391
Get the wrong picture they don't get better.

124
00:05:33.504 --> 00:05:34.687
<v Interviewer>And this is really,</v>

125
00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:38.078
just hearing from a couple of friends of Scott's,

126
00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:39.859
which is how we found you.

127
00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:41.000
They've been with you for,

128
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.075
one of them's been coming to you

129
00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.896
for at least 17 years she says,

130
00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:46.616
and you've just done miracles with their lives

131
00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.193
where the field of medicine weren't able

132
00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:49.942
to do a thing for them,

133
00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:52.384
some pretty serious conditions as well,

134
00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:54.966
and this spans over physical but also

135
00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:56.059
it goes beyond physical.

136
00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.571
<v Henrietta>Homeopathy does it and treats on all levels</v>

137
00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:02.082
when you take a case,

138
00:06:02.082 --> 00:06:04.886
your people come in with a physical thing usually

139
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.296
and you take all the details about that.

140
00:06:07.296 --> 00:06:11.421
And when I say detail you're going into extraordinary detail

141
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.683
like what makes it better or worse?

142
00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:17.776
The temperature, the position, pressure, touch,

143
00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:19.801
and when they say pain,

144
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:22.667
I mean we're saying "so what kind of pain?"

145
00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:23.711
And they say "oh it hurts!"

146
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:25.511
and I say "you know, that's not enough."

147
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:28.149
Is it stitching or burning or cramping or squeezing

148
00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:31.392
or travelling around or what have you?

149
00:06:31.392 --> 00:06:33.672
And you build up this picture

150
00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:35.641
on a physical level of what's going on

151
00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:37.475
but you also need to know,

152
00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:40.115
what is going on emotionally.

153
00:06:40.247 --> 00:06:43.191
And quite often, not always but quite often,

154
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:46.283
some great emotional thing happened

155
00:06:46.283 --> 00:06:48.736
at the beginning or before

156
00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:50.952
the physical symptoms came on.

157
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:55.952
And once constantly finding you go back to that

158
00:06:56.338 --> 00:07:00.358
and find out what it was, how they felt at the time,

159
00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:04.745
and the remedies by enlarge

160
00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:07.667
will end up treating that the cause,

161
00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.649
and that is what is getting them better

162
00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.176
so when you're building up a picture of the patient,

163
00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:14.195
you're building up an enormous..

164
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.172
It's a very detailed enormous picture,

165
00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:19.280
you've got the Mentals,

166
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.963
what we rather rudely call the mentals

167
00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:23.481
we're training the emotional side of things,

168
00:07:24.248 --> 00:07:26.765
the Generals which are things like sleep

169
00:07:26.765 --> 00:07:29.142
and food, reactions to food,

170
00:07:29.142 --> 00:07:31.456
and then the Particulars which are

171
00:07:31.456 --> 00:07:32.576
little bits of you.

172
00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:35.294
My foot, my nose, my head, my whatever,

173
00:07:36.384 --> 00:07:38.971
and everything about each of those things,

174
00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:41.530
every detail is required

175
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.642
to build up a picture so you can imagine

176
00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:46.413
it takes quite a long time, particularly first time,

177
00:07:46.413 --> 00:07:48.459
and occasionally you get patients who

178
00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:50.720
despite being desperate to get better,

179
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.810
find it very difficult to explain their symptoms.

180
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.671
And some are very resistant to

181
00:07:58.973 --> 00:08:00.594
even telling you stuff,

182
00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:03.485
but the minute somebody becomes resistant you're thinking

183
00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:06.463
"Aha! What is it that I need to know?"

184
00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:09.283
And you have to be very good at getting this information

185
00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:11.648
out of them without them realizing

186
00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:13.725
what you're about really,

187
00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:17.766
because if people getting defensive about something you know

188
00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:21.114
that whatever it is upset them a lot at the time and

189
00:08:21.114 --> 00:08:22.637
you need to get that detail

190
00:08:22.637 --> 00:08:24.054
or you will be in the dark.

191
00:08:24.054 --> 00:08:25.487
You'll be fumbling around in the dark

192
00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.012
when you're prescribing,

193
00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:28.990
so it's on all levels.

194
00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:33.654
<v Interviewer>Yes, and it would seem that, well,</v>

195
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:37.157
in a lot of cases you must deal with people

196
00:08:37.157 --> 00:08:38.936
that have chronic conditions,

197
00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:42.439
and generally speaking chronic conditions if you go into

198
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.715
allopathic medicine, traditional medicine,

199
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:48.161
there's almost never an actual cure

200
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:51.463
for the base of a chronic condition,

201
00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:54.696
and again it really must go back to the fact as you said,

202
00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:58.362
so much might be trauma based on some level

203
00:08:58.362 --> 00:08:59.907
that's not known even to the person who has a displayance.

204
00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:03.014
<v Henrietta>It's often trauma based, but not always.</v>

205
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.440
Sometimes in inherited we're gonna say

206
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.392
it's recreated tendency

207
00:09:08.392 --> 00:09:10.098
to get certain conditions.

208
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.936
Sometimes it could be since a vaccination,

209
00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:16.152
or since another disease that's been

210
00:09:16.152 --> 00:09:19.022
what we call suppressed with conventional drugs,

211
00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:25.124
and then a new disease has led on from that.

212
00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:28.470
For instance if you get a child with eczema,

213
00:09:29.989 --> 00:09:31.737
they put on cortisone cream

214
00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:35.235
and their skin looks lovely, and mum is happy.

215
00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:38.197
But a few months or years down the line,

216
00:09:38.197 --> 00:09:41.674
they start getting asthma or bronchial problems,

217
00:09:41.674 --> 00:09:44.745
and then they're on to puffers and stuff.

218
00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:46.525
If you're taking a case

219
00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:49.046
with somebody like that,

220
00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:50.982
you're also going through their whole medical history

221
00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:52.784
so you find out what happened.

222
00:09:52.784 --> 00:09:56.419
You may find that the eczema happened after the DPT jab,

223
00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:58.456
so you've actually got to go back even farther.

224
00:09:58.456 --> 00:09:59.617
<v Interviewer>Oh interesting news!</v>

225
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:03.344
<v ->So you'd start by treating the asthma which is on the top</v>

226
00:10:03.344 --> 00:10:05.029
which is what the child's come for,

227
00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:08.356
and during the process of getting the asthma better

228
00:10:08.356 --> 00:10:09.901
which is always possible,

229
00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:11.804
to cure it I mean,

230
00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:14.209
Though I think by law I'm not allowed to say that,

231
00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:20.083
the eczema will come back as the asthma improves,

232
00:10:20.283 --> 00:10:22.093
and then you have to treat the eczema.

233
00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:23.956
Now unless you spend a lot of time

234
00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.181
explaining it to the parent

235
00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:27.921
that this is what's going to happen and they've got to

236
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:30.833
go with it cause this is how the body cures itself,

237
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.899
they can be quite upset about that

238
00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.015
but you've got to explain,

239
00:10:34.015 --> 00:10:35.491
and they've got to persevere.

240
00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:37.425
After all it will have taken a number of years

241
00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:39.766
to get the child to the stage,

242
00:10:39.964 --> 00:10:43.152
with asthma, can't run, can't play sports I think

243
00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:45.411
asthma attacks at three in the morning or whatever it is.

244
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.081
Very debilitating, very horrible drugs,

245
00:10:48.132 --> 00:10:51.811
so you peel this onion, you get the asthma going,

246
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:53.536
you get the eczema going.

247
00:10:53.536 --> 00:10:55.945
And what can happen at some stage,

248
00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:58.707
if for instance it's following a DPT jab,

249
00:10:58.707 --> 00:11:00.722
which does happen,

250
00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:06.832
you're giving the most similar remedy you can find

251
00:11:07.142 --> 00:11:09.978
to fit this child, for the eczema,

252
00:11:09.978 --> 00:11:12.543
and suddenly it stops working,

253
00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:15.187
or it works for a very short time.

254
00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:16.930
So you look back and you say

255
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.155
"well, when did the eczema start?"

256
00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:20.630
"Oh well, it's about when he was three months old."

257
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.421
And I said, "what happened when he was two months old?"

258
00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:24.554
And they'll say, "he only had the DPT jab."

259
00:11:24.554 --> 00:11:26.698
So you then give a remedy to do with..

260
00:11:26.698 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Interviewer>DPT vaccine?</v>

261
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.841
<v ->The DPT vaccine, yeah.</v>

262
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.039
You give a remedy to deal with that

263
00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:35.396
weakness that's been created by that,

264
00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:37.976
followed by a remedy to deal with

265
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.627
a similar remedy as the child's eczema,

266
00:11:40.627 --> 00:11:42.206
and they get better.

267
00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:44.376
The child has no idea of what's been given,

268
00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.326
it's just a nice little sugar pill,

269
00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:48.447
and they were just going to tell me,

270
00:11:48.447 --> 00:11:51.188
that that eczema wasn't caused by the DPT jab,

271
00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:54.510
or that the asthma wasn't caused by suppressing

272
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.969
the eczema in the first place,

273
00:11:55.969 --> 00:11:58.954
so you've got this constant sequence of events

274
00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:01.395
that happens with conventional medicine,

275
00:12:01.395 --> 00:12:03.761
which suppresses and suppresses,

276
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.661
and when somebody comes to have a homeopathy,

277
00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:09.355
at what stage in the suppression

278
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:11.237
are you actually going to see them?

279
00:12:12.241 --> 00:12:14.481
And sometimes, you know a chronic disease,

280
00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:15.599
one of the complaints,

281
00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:17.597
"oh it takes a long time to get better!"

282
00:12:17.597 --> 00:12:20.730
But we are actually getting them properly better.

283
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.604
<v Interviewer>They're actually getting better</v>

284
00:12:21.604 --> 00:12:24.021
you're not just masking symptoms as happens with druidics?

285
00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:25.138
<v ->No. Hiding the symptoms,</v>

286
00:12:25.138 --> 00:12:27.630
and you see allopathic medicine doesn't just hide symptoms,

287
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.006
it actually drives them inwards.

288
00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:32.035
There's a thing called the Direction of Cure

289
00:12:32.035 --> 00:12:37.035
which applies to all alternative therapies really,

290
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.160
but it's particularly important with homeopathy,

291
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160
is that as you get better,

292
00:12:45.355 --> 00:12:47.729
the symptoms go from within outwards,

293
00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:52.065
So from your eczema to your..

294
00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:56.399
your asthma to your eczema,

295
00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.638
I mean that happens above downwards,

296
00:12:58.638 --> 00:13:00.814
so obviously somebody's head program

297
00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:03.053
is more important than their big toe,

298
00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:05.145
above downwards from..

299
00:13:06.862 --> 00:13:09.504
above downwards, and the reverse order in which they came,

300
00:13:09.504 --> 00:13:10.970
it's self explained,

301
00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.359
and from a more serious bit of you

302
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.198
to a less serious bit of you.

303
00:13:17.423 --> 00:13:20.025
That is how you tell whether you're actually

304
00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:21.305
getting somebody better,

305
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:24.721
if they follow these rules,

306
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.407
and that applies to all true cures whether it's homeopathy

307
00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:29.619
or something else.

308
00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:33.277
Whereas conventional medicine actually drives it inwards,

309
00:13:33.277 --> 00:13:36.103
and people come with a more serious condition

310
00:13:36.103 --> 00:13:37.230
time and time again.

311
00:13:37.463 --> 00:13:40.503
You suppress a runny nose with some beastly squirty stuff

312
00:13:40.503 --> 00:13:41.911
that Oedipus gave you,

313
00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:43.958
and you can get sinus and headaches

314
00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.569
and goodness knows what else.

315
00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:48.681
With homeopathy you treat somebody who says

316
00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:50.899
"oh, I'm always getting colds and headaches."

317
00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:53.662
and you get a runny nose again, so..

318
00:13:53.817 --> 00:13:54.968
<v Interviewer>Yeah, so it sort of goes,</v>

319
00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:56.715
it's sort of of in reverse as you said.

320
00:13:56.715 --> 00:13:58.378
And as you're speaking about this

321
00:13:58.378 --> 00:13:59.368
someone might have the idea,

322
00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:01.960
"Oh goodness! It sounds like it takes a very long time

323
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.091
and a lot of visits to get something right."

324
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:05.665
<v ->Only in chronic things.</v>

325
00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:06.391
<v Interviewer>I was going to..</v>

326
00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:08.994
<v ->In an acute, you've got somebody,</v>

327
00:14:08.994 --> 00:14:11.518
I don't know 7th degree burns or something,

328
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.765
you can get rid of the pain in seven minutes,

329
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:17.086
and that can be a big burn and a nasty burn.

330
00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:20.321
Half the time you wouldn't need skin grafts

331
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:21.690
and things like that.

332
00:14:23.883 --> 00:14:27.940
Burns, injuries. I can remember last week some woman came in

333
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.831
and she put her back out or something,

334
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:32.544
and she was staggering in to my office,

335
00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:36.586
and couldn't sit down, hurt too much,

336
00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:38.054
so I worked out what she needed,

337
00:14:38.054 --> 00:14:40.373
gave her a pill and she just walked out.

338
00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:41.303
<v Interviewer>I know, it is amazing.</v>

339
00:14:41.303 --> 00:14:42.608
<v ->And she was in a terrible stupor,</v>

340
00:14:42.608 --> 00:14:44.911
she was about to go on holiday and sit in an airplane.

341
00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:45.837
You know it's (both speakers laugh)

342
00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:47.131
<v Interviewer>So it was a life saver for her?</v>

343
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:48.880
<v ->I mean it had to work quickly.</v>

344
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.758
In an acute, remedies work very quickly.

345
00:14:51.817 --> 00:14:54.334
When it's a matter of life and death they work quickly,

346
00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:55.725
and that's when the thing,

347
00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:58.133
whatever it is come on very recently.

348
00:14:58.133 --> 00:15:00.467
You know, cholera for instance,

349
00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:02.943
bird flu for instance, anything like that.

350
00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:05.555
Whereas if something has taken

351
00:15:05.555 --> 00:15:08.792
decades to come on like rheumatism, heart disease

352
00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:13.792
usually, tumors, all sorts of things take forever to grow,

353
00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:17.999
they are slow to go because that is the nature of the beast,

354
00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:21.145
and homeopathy has to cure in a similar way

355
00:15:21.145 --> 00:15:22.343
to the patient.

356
00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:23.936
So you've got a fast acting thing,

357
00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:25.995
you've got a fast acting remedy.

358
00:15:25.995 --> 00:15:29.242
Got a slow acting thing, it will go slowly.

359
00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:31.358
Though sometimes I have to say I'm absolutely astonished

360
00:15:31.358 --> 00:15:33.331
how quickly things can get better,

361
00:15:33.331 --> 00:15:35.807
when I think they should be slow. (both laugh)

362
00:15:35.922 --> 00:15:38.154
<v Interviewer>Well one thing I observed recently was</v>

363
00:15:38.154 --> 00:15:41.089
just for, I don't know why, but I went to

364
00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:44.161
a store in California before we came here to England,

365
00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:48.309
and picked up a few over the counter homeopathic remedies

366
00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:50.764
for the trip just in case I got a chest cold

367
00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:52.673
or anything happened along the way,

368
00:15:52.673 --> 00:15:55.841
and as it ended up, as we arrived here,

369
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:58.590
Scott's parents who are 83 and 90 years old

370
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.093
both ended with real nasty chest colds,

371
00:16:02.206 --> 00:16:03.927
and I said, "Well here I have these with me."

372
00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:06.283
They didn't happen to have any, they had run out,

373
00:16:06.283 --> 00:16:08.012
of this one particular thing,

374
00:16:08.012 --> 00:16:10.437
and it was gone in 24 hours for both of them

375
00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:12.767
and it was a very deep rattling cough.

376
00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:13.905
I was shocked.

377
00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:16.887
I think they were even shocked that it had gone so quickly.

378
00:16:16.887 --> 00:16:19.969
<v ->Even occasionally now I'm still surprised after</v>

379
00:16:19.969 --> 00:16:22.230
years and years but on the whole

380
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.774
I expect it and then

381
00:16:24.214 --> 00:16:26.267
forget what other people expect (laughs)

382
00:16:26.267 --> 00:16:27.610
<v Interviewer>While everyone else is so surprised</v>

383
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.254
and marvels at it.

384
00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:29.415
<v ->Yes, I think "well that's what it does!"</v>

385
00:16:29.415 --> 00:16:32.639
<v Interviewer>Yes. Now let's backtrack a little bit and go</v>

386
00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:37.639
back to Hahnemann and the origins of modern homeopathy,

387
00:16:37.699 --> 00:16:39.424
and go into this whole thing that comes up

388
00:16:39.424 --> 00:16:40.832
as you say in that,

389
00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:45.734
there was an interview of homeopaths recently on television,

390
00:16:45.734 --> 00:16:49.488
and one of the things they bring up repeatedly is well,

391
00:16:49.488 --> 00:16:51.906
"How could it possibly work when there are no

392
00:16:51.906 --> 00:16:54.452
remaining particles of the original substance?"

393
00:16:54.643 --> 00:16:56.672
<v ->That's very simple, but unfortunately..</v>

394
00:16:56.672 --> 00:16:58.369
<v Interviewer>But let's go into Hahnemann and why</v>

395
00:16:58.369 --> 00:16:59.289
that is so important essentially.

396
00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:03.032
<v ->Hahnemann was born in 1755</v>

397
00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:05.312
and he was a very clever man,

398
00:17:05.312 --> 00:17:07.680
he was a linguist and a doctor,

399
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.924
and much respected in the allopathic field,

400
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:16.158
but he got very disheartened and stopped practicing,

401
00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:19.430
gave up because he found all the

402
00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:23.482
treatments were so grotesque and ghastly,

403
00:17:23.482 --> 00:17:26.346
and mostly killed people literally.

404
00:17:27.397 --> 00:17:29.701
So he ended up, and he had hundreds of children,

405
00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:32.484
well not hundreds but at least 10 I think,

406
00:17:33.566 --> 00:17:38.566
and he ended translating medical texts,

407
00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:42.608
and because he was a good doctor he commented on these

408
00:17:42.608 --> 00:17:44.104
and so on and everybody,

409
00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:48.395
all the doctors respected what his observations were.

410
00:17:48.395 --> 00:17:53.395
And he noticed that the only drugs that actually worked

411
00:17:54.261 --> 00:17:56.814
were the ones which in their crude poisonings,

412
00:17:57.131 --> 00:18:00.718
were similar to the symptoms they were designed to cure,

413
00:18:01.035 --> 00:18:03.854
and the more he researched, the more he translated

414
00:18:03.854 --> 00:18:06.168
the more he saw that this was the case,

415
00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:06.823
so he thought,

416
00:18:06.823 --> 00:18:10.415
"Well, why don't we test these drugs out on people,

417
00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:12.913
and see what symptoms they produce,

418
00:18:12.913 --> 00:18:15.401
and all sorts of things, you know different minerals,

419
00:18:15.401 --> 00:18:17.358
different plants, different everything,

420
00:18:17.358 --> 00:18:20.956
and see what pictures of symptoms they produce

421
00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:23.808
and then use those when we meet with those symptoms

422
00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:25.417
on a sick person."

423
00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:28.001
And he did this. He must have had some very loyal friends

424
00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:29.018
who put up with all he gave them..

425
00:18:29.018 --> 00:18:29.800
<v Interviewer>He must have! (laughs)</v>

426
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.236
<v ->cause they're pretty grave on some of the readings.</v>

427
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.293
<v Interviewer>Hopefully none died.</v>

428
00:18:32.293 --> 00:18:35.130
<v ->And he.. You know some of them did I think.</v>

429
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.395
And he realized it worked,

430
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.167
so he got fright fixated, went back into medical practice

431
00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:44.393
and was doing homeopathy all the time,

432
00:18:44.393 --> 00:18:46.387
but he had a problem because

433
00:18:46.387 --> 00:18:50.348
when you give a poison to somebody as we all know

434
00:18:50.348 --> 00:18:51.998
from conventional medicine,

435
00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:54.047
it can be very unpleasant and produce

436
00:18:54.047 --> 00:18:55.796
some very nasty symptoms.

437
00:18:56.546 --> 00:18:59.372
So he diluted them a bit,

438
00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:01.702
and tried to give the maximum amount,

439
00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:04.617
or the least amount that actually worked,

440
00:19:04.617 --> 00:19:07.464
but at that stage it was still measurable

441
00:19:07.464 --> 00:19:09.723
in terms of conventional opinion..

442
00:19:09.723 --> 00:19:12.255
<v Interviewer>Yes, and potentially toxic?</v>

443
00:19:12.255 --> 00:19:14.808
<v ->And anyway, he was carrying on doing that</v>

444
00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:18.124
and one day a couple of, two or three of his remedies

445
00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:19.832
fell out of his medical bag when he was travelling

446
00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:21.432
in his carriage somewhere,

447
00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:23.473
and had a thorough good shaking,

448
00:19:23.473 --> 00:19:25.696
rolling about in the carriage floor.

449
00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:26.851
He thought no more about it,

450
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:28.454
put them back in the bag at the end of the journey,

451
00:19:28.454 --> 00:19:29.776
carried on working,

452
00:19:29.776 --> 00:19:33.259
and then he noticed that those few remedies worked

453
00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:35.264
a million times better than all the others.

454
00:19:35.264 --> 00:19:36.704
<v Interviewer>Because they'd been shaken up?</v>

455
00:19:36.704 --> 00:19:38.049
<v ->(nods in agreement) And he thought,</v>

456
00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:39.080
"what is going on here?"

457
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.809
He was completely puzzled, but being so enterprising,

458
00:19:41.809 --> 00:19:44.119
inquisitive sort of person,

459
00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:48.524
he then started diluting remedies and shaking them up

460
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.326
to see whether it happened to the others,

461
00:19:51.326 --> 00:19:53.928
or other remedies or whether it was just a one off,

462
00:19:53.928 --> 00:19:56.994
and sure enough it applied to all his remedies,

463
00:19:58.247 --> 00:20:01.862
so he then started diluting and shaking them,

464
00:20:01.862 --> 00:20:03.749
what he called succusing them,

465
00:20:03.749 --> 00:20:06.536
in a very meticulous way.

466
00:20:06.797 --> 00:20:09.580
The scales were very carefully thought out,

467
00:20:10.465 --> 00:20:14.110
and providing you succus or shake the remedy

468
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.126
at every stage with the dilution,

469
00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:19.672
they become more effective, more potent,

470
00:20:19.899 --> 00:20:23.150
and if you don't do that they just become more diluted

471
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.796
and more ineffective,

472
00:20:24.941 --> 00:20:28.226
and it's absolutely brilliant,

473
00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:32.033
it's an absolute fact that the higher potencies homeopathy

474
00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:34.954
are the things that do the really incredible cures.

475
00:20:34.954 --> 00:20:36.957
I mean sometimes you only need a low potency,

476
00:20:36.957 --> 00:20:39.452
but if they weren't potentized,

477
00:20:39.452 --> 00:20:41.756
if they weren't energized in this way,

478
00:20:41.756 --> 00:20:45.252
they would be inefficient and not very good,

479
00:20:45.252 --> 00:20:46.946
but the minute you potentize them,

480
00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.841
also could be the succussion, they work.

481
00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:52.954
Very strongly. It's absolutely fantastic.

482
00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:55.518
<v Interviewer>It almost seems like you'd say</v>

483
00:20:55.518 --> 00:20:58.408
potentization of the pure information,

484
00:20:58.408 --> 00:21:01.664
because again when you get to where it's diluted out

485
00:21:01.664 --> 00:21:03.549
where you have no remaining particles

486
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:05.075
of the original substance,

487
00:21:05.075 --> 00:21:08.582
all that's left really is the informational imprint?

488
00:21:08.582 --> 00:21:12.933
<v ->Well, it's actually explained by Quantum Physics</v>

489
00:21:12.933 --> 00:21:14.226
very well.

490
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.896
Quantum Physics, cause Hahnemann didn't know that,

491
00:21:16.896 --> 00:21:19.279
cause Quantum Physics wasn't sort of discovered

492
00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:22.329
till I guess about in the 1930's.

493
00:21:24.234 --> 00:21:28.005
That basically proved that matter

494
00:21:28.005 --> 00:21:30.962
isn't a solid, passive, inert,

495
00:21:30.962 --> 00:21:33.030
boring old substance doing nothing,

496
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.541
it's actually full of vibrating rhythmic particles,

497
00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:40.862
not necessarily whizzing around but moving around

498
00:21:40.862 --> 00:21:44.244
and if you then start succussing them,

499
00:21:44.244 --> 00:21:46.742
quite energetically and with homeopathy,

500
00:21:46.742 --> 00:21:48.728
it's not just a feeble little shake,

501
00:21:48.728 --> 00:21:49.676
it's a real hard (bangs palm)

502
00:21:49.676 --> 00:21:51.585
I know I'm not allowed to do that, (laughs)

503
00:21:51.585 --> 00:21:53.538
<v Interviewer>Not in front of the mic but yes.</v>

504
00:21:56.284 --> 00:21:58.459
<v ->It's supposed to be done 40 times or something</v>

505
00:21:58.459 --> 00:22:00.457
between each thing.

506
00:22:00.933 --> 00:22:04.048
It doesn't require much imagintion to realize

507
00:22:04.048 --> 00:22:07.963
that these colliding particles actually are producing energy

508
00:22:08.468 --> 00:22:13.468
and what I find fascinating is if you freeze remedies

509
00:22:14.983 --> 00:22:17.585
they produce different crystal patterns

510
00:22:17.585 --> 00:22:20.774
according to what remedy and what potency they are,

511
00:22:20.774 --> 00:22:24.879
so all those doubters who say there's nothing left,

512
00:22:24.879 --> 00:22:27.414
you can freeze Belladona 200 and it will produce

513
00:22:27.414 --> 00:22:29.598
a different crystal pattern from

514
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.687
freezing bryonia 200 or..

515
00:22:31.687 --> 00:22:32.677
<v Interviewer>Yes, makes total sense.</v>

516
00:22:32.677 --> 00:22:35.825
<v ->(mumbles) you know, and it's so irritating</v>

517
00:22:35.825 --> 00:22:36.731
when all these people say,

518
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:39.002
"there's nothing there, there's nothing happening."

519
00:22:39.002 --> 00:22:42.148
When we've known since 1935 or whenever it was

520
00:22:42.148 --> 00:22:43.572
about Quantum Physics.

521
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:47.917
We've known forever that disease actually

522
00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:49.698
is dynamic in origin because

523
00:22:49.698 --> 00:22:51.787
we're not just a bunch of chemicals,

524
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.305
there is some energy, electromagnetic or whatever

525
00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:55.388
you would call it,

526
00:22:55.388 --> 00:22:56.914
holding us all together.

527
00:22:56.914 --> 00:22:58.663
I guess without that we' be dead.

528
00:22:58.663 --> 00:23:02.095
And with homeopathy you've got to have a dynamic remedy

529
00:23:02.095 --> 00:23:05.140
to match the dynamic energy of a person.

530
00:23:06.124 --> 00:23:08.867
To be truly homeopathic it's got to be dynamic,

531
00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:11.612
not just a material substance. And..

532
00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:13.652
<v Interviewer>It does seem very quantum in it's nature</v>

533
00:23:13.652 --> 00:23:15.091
when you start thinking about that.

534
00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:18.226
Once the matter being removed, the very thing that

535
00:23:18.226 --> 00:23:22.184
the reporters and such will hone in on to,

536
00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:24.474
essentially debunk it.

537
00:23:24.474 --> 00:23:27.266
It is the very part of it that they're missing

538
00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:29.769
in the inquiry because this is where this

539
00:23:29.769 --> 00:23:30.538
information is.

540
00:23:30.538 --> 00:23:32.602
<v ->I just find it extraordinary that</v>

541
00:23:32.602 --> 00:23:35.171
you get even scientists saying, "oh, it can't be true!"

542
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:37.411
But they all know about Quantum Physics.

543
00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:38.785
What's the matter with them?

544
00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:41.475
They've gone brain dead while it's happening? I don't know.

545
00:23:41.475 --> 00:23:42.580
It is quite extraordinary.

546
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.345
<v Interviewer>Well, we'll get into that part</v>

547
00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:45.592
of it in a little bit because we know it's very purposeful

548
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.993
that this is not better known in the United States,

549
00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:50.487
and more properly used in Britain and other places

550
00:23:50.487 --> 00:23:52.236
around the world as well.

551
00:23:52.686 --> 00:23:53.940
After Hahnemann discovered this,

552
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.539
that was really the birth of then..

553
00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:56.914
<v ->As it is today, yes absolutely.</v>

554
00:23:56.914 --> 00:23:58.172
<v Interviewer>As it is today.</v>

555
00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:00.014
Let's talk about when someone

556
00:24:00.749 --> 00:24:02.166
uses a modern remedy,

557
00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:05.521
it can come in a number of forms but the most common one

558
00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:06.703
that I think we would see,

559
00:24:07.173 --> 00:24:09.324
say over the counter if you go to the drugstore

560
00:24:09.324 --> 00:24:10.529
and get a homeopathic remedy,

561
00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:12.725
are in the form of little sugar pills.

562
00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:15.059
How does that work? What is it actually made of,

563
00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:17.644
and how is that information suspended?

564
00:24:17.807 --> 00:24:20.429
<v ->Originally you have what we call the Mother Tincture,</v>

565
00:24:20.429 --> 00:24:23.352
which to get to the mother tincture it's

566
00:24:23.883 --> 00:24:26.578
written down in great detail in the homeopathic form

567
00:24:26.578 --> 00:24:29.184
it could be a how you do of each substance,

568
00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:30.804
exactly what you do,

569
00:24:30.804 --> 00:24:33.415
but basically it's the substance, the original substance.

570
00:24:33.415 --> 00:24:36.464
It was proved, preserved in a very high,

571
00:24:36.464 --> 00:24:39.450
I guess 98% alcohol, whatever.

572
00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:41.356
And that is a mother tincture,

573
00:24:41.356 --> 00:24:43.536
and quite often, obviously that is poisonous.

574
00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:45.428
Not always, but (nods)

575
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:50.564
And how you make the potencies is that you take

576
00:24:50.564 --> 00:24:52.835
one drop of the mother tincture,

577
00:24:52.835 --> 00:24:57.835
and put it in with nine drops of alcohol

578
00:24:58.093 --> 00:24:59.215
and succus it,

579
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.711
and that makes a 1X.

580
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:01.466
<v Interviewer>Being shaken?</v>

581
00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:03.991
<v ->Yeah, that makes a 1X</v>

582
00:25:03.997 --> 00:25:07.279
You then take one drop of 1X and put it

583
00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:09.144
with nine drops of alcohol,

584
00:25:09.144 --> 00:25:10.994
and that is a 2X,

585
00:25:12.022 --> 00:25:13.532
you've got to succus it at each stage,

586
00:25:13.532 --> 00:25:14.929
whether this is just a dilution,

587
00:25:14.929 --> 00:25:17.755
and to get a 3X you get a drop of 2X,

588
00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:20.481
and nine drops of alcohol and so on.

589
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:24.276
In England we call that the tenths range

590
00:25:24.276 --> 00:25:25.395
which is X's,

591
00:25:25.395 --> 00:25:27.855
but I think in Europe they call them D's

592
00:25:27.855 --> 00:25:30.367
so I don't know what they call them in the states.

593
00:25:30.817 --> 00:25:34.507
Another range of potencies is the centesimal,

594
00:25:34.507 --> 00:25:36.172
which as ours is a C,

595
00:25:36.172 --> 00:25:39.061
or if you see a number with no letter after it,

596
00:25:39.061 --> 00:25:39.591
it is still a centesimal.

597
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:41.607
<v Interviewer>Like the common one you would see in the US</v>

598
00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:43.055
would be 30C.

599
00:25:43.055 --> 00:25:45.934
<v ->Right 30, and quite often you can..</v>

600
00:25:45.934 --> 00:25:49.388
If you ever get a number alone, it always means a C.

601
00:25:49.388 --> 00:25:51.381
It doesn't mean an X or anything else,

602
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:53.793
and that is one drop of mother tincture,

603
00:25:53.793 --> 00:25:58.121
99 drops of alcohol and succussed to get a 1C.

604
00:25:58.121 --> 00:26:03.042
2C is one drop of 1C, 99 drops of alcohol and succused

605
00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:03.519
and you get a 2C.

606
00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:05.106
<v Interviewer>So you're really getting pretty far away</v>

607
00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:06.651
from the original substances by now?

608
00:26:06.651 --> 00:26:09.400
<v ->Oh yeah, and you can go up to however high you want,</v>

609
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.487
30C, 200C.

610
00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:13.383
All these at this stage are in a liquid.

611
00:26:14.566 --> 00:26:16.047
You can either medicate the remedies,

612
00:26:16.047 --> 00:26:18.926
I always medicate the remedies myself here,

613
00:26:18.926 --> 00:26:22.208
but a pharmacist would do exactly the same thing

614
00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:25.322
if you order Bryonia 30 for instance,

615
00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:28.714
they'll have a bottle of unmedicated sugar pills,

616
00:26:28.714 --> 00:26:30.560
and will put a number of drops

617
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.588
of the liquid remedy into that.

618
00:26:33.588 --> 00:26:34.399
<v Interviewer>Oh I see!</v>

619
00:26:34.399 --> 00:26:36.900
<v ->And that's how gets by that,</v>

620
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.849
and they can be in powders, liquids,

621
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:41.055
pills, tablets, whatever,

622
00:26:41.908 --> 00:26:45.771
but you know it's not a very exciting bit (laughs)

623
00:26:45.933 --> 00:26:46.943
that's how it's done.

624
00:26:46.943 --> 00:26:48.692
<v Interviewer>I was wondering how that happened</v>

625
00:26:48.692 --> 00:26:50.336
with the sugar pills.

626
00:26:51.727 --> 00:26:54.050
<v ->Then there's another range, the thousands range</v>

627
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.597
where there's M,

628
00:26:55.597 --> 00:26:57.969
and you can go up to 50M, 60M, (mumbles)

629
00:26:57.969 --> 00:26:59.792
so you can go very high.

630
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:02.362
The important thing supposedly

631
00:27:02.362 --> 00:27:04.480
for people who don't believe homeopathy,

632
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.822
and don't believe in this potency business,

633
00:27:06.822 --> 00:27:11.569
is that round about a, somewhere between a 12X and a 24X

634
00:27:11.569 --> 00:27:15.674
is when the material particle completely disappears,

635
00:27:15.674 --> 00:27:20.388
and round about a 6C and a 12C,

636
00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:24.776
so we do know where you can no longer

637
00:27:25.849 --> 00:27:28.138
measure it in a material way,

638
00:27:28.138 --> 00:27:30.643
but we don't want to because we actually know

639
00:27:30.643 --> 00:27:32.349
that the potencies work.

640
00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:34.249
<v Interviewer>Let's talk about it in reverse then.</v>

641
00:27:34.249 --> 00:27:35.805
What if someone were, say,

642
00:27:36.482 --> 00:27:38.250
they did what I did and decided to just

643
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.810
self dose, right. I know.

644
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.721
<v ->No I didn't say anything.</v>

645
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:44.248
<v Interviewer>I know you're being very polite</v>

646
00:27:44.248 --> 00:27:46.273
and not saying a word right now (laughs)

647
00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:48.971
but let's say that a lot of people have done that

648
00:27:48.971 --> 00:27:49.523
and will do it..

649
00:27:49.523 --> 00:27:50.143
<v ->Yeah, lot's of people do it.</v>

650
00:27:50.143 --> 00:27:51.728
<v Interviewer>Because they also don't have access</v>

651
00:27:51.728 --> 00:27:53.860
to a good homeopath for example.

652
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.269
But let's say that happens and now you're at the,

653
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:58.603
over the 12X strength

654
00:27:58.603 --> 00:28:01.067
so you don't have any of the original substance in.

655
00:28:01.067 --> 00:28:04.338
Can a person hurt themselves or harm themselves

656
00:28:04.338 --> 00:28:07.185
by self dosing on the wrong one or does it simply not work,

657
00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.356
it just falls on deaf cells?

658
00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:13.138
<v ->You would have to be very stupid for a very long time,</v>

659
00:28:13.453 --> 00:28:16.397
the only way you could produce symptoms

660
00:28:16.397 --> 00:28:18.452
from taking a remedy,

661
00:28:18.452 --> 00:28:20.671
let's say bryonia 30,

662
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:23.496
you would have to take it on and on

663
00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:26.701
for months on end,

664
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.553
and then you would actually start producing bryonia symptoms

665
00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:34.509
but nobody does that, and everybody antidotes.

666
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:36.642
These remedies are very easy to antidote,

667
00:28:36.642 --> 00:28:38.487
so nobody does it.

668
00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:42.487
I did once have a guy who was very vain.

669
00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:44.767
I cannot remember what he came to me for,

670
00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:47.827
but he did spend the whole time sort of titivating his hair

671
00:28:47.827 --> 00:28:50.768
and telling me that I needed a haircut and things like that,

672
00:28:51.302 --> 00:28:54.064
and he had taken arsenica

673
00:28:54.064 --> 00:28:56.100
which is basically made out of arsenic.

674
00:28:57.366 --> 00:29:00.309
I think he'd taken Arsenica 30 everyday for a year.

675
00:29:00.309 --> 00:29:00.596
<v Interviewer>Why?</v>

676
00:29:00.596 --> 00:29:03.198
<v ->Because he thought it would make his skin beautiful,</v>

677
00:29:03.198 --> 00:29:06.387
and his skin was beautiful I might add (both laugh)

678
00:29:06.387 --> 00:29:08.723
but he was very vain and

679
00:29:09.223 --> 00:29:10.469
he knew what he was doing.

680
00:29:10.469 --> 00:29:12.377
<v Interviewer>So he was dosing with arsenic for his beauty</v>

681
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:14.104
<v ->He knew what he was doing,</v>

682
00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:17.095
but I've never come across anybody doing a thing

683
00:29:17.095 --> 00:29:18.872
as silly as that (interviewer laughs)

684
00:29:18.872 --> 00:29:20.686
and I'm sure I won't again.

685
00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:23.118
And by enlarge with all these things is like you know

686
00:29:23.118 --> 00:29:24.641
if people take the wrong vitamins,

687
00:29:24.641 --> 00:29:26.817
but then a lot of people get bored with taking it

688
00:29:26.817 --> 00:29:28.560
and stop after they're halfway through a bottle

689
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.075
and it never does any harm.

690
00:29:30.959 --> 00:29:33.594
You really can't do harm with homeopathy.

691
00:29:33.594 --> 00:29:34.882
<v Interviewer>And that's one of the beauties of it,</v>

692
00:29:34.882 --> 00:29:37.665
is that even in the worst case scenario

693
00:29:37.665 --> 00:29:39.711
and under the worst care you can't hurt yourself,

694
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:43.999
but the benefits of what can happen with such a tiny amount

695
00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:45.887
is just really astounding.

696
00:29:47.183 --> 00:29:50.724
I have to say I'm completely intrigued with this now,

697
00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:53.423
and so let's talk about

698
00:29:54.017 --> 00:29:56.033
some of the protocol issues,

699
00:29:56.033 --> 00:29:58.261
for example, I wanna talk about a couple of more

700
00:29:58.261 --> 00:30:00.330
case scenarios that you've had to,

701
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.965
besides the fellow taking arsenic (laughs)

702
00:30:02.965 --> 00:30:03.771
for his lovely skin.

703
00:30:03.771 --> 00:30:06.959
<v ->I've forgotten about it. (laughs) He completely did.</v>

704
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:10.103
<v Interviewer>Tell me a couple more of those</v>

705
00:30:10.103 --> 00:30:12.692
that have just been really astounding even to you.

706
00:30:12.692 --> 00:30:14.216
We won't talk about the more mundane things

707
00:30:14.216 --> 00:30:16.252
because you see results everyday from people,

708
00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:19.137
but a couple of astounding situations.

709
00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:22.703
<v ->The trouble is I'm not really astounded any more.</v>

710
00:30:22.703 --> 00:30:25.528
I know it'll work. I know that if..

711
00:30:25.528 --> 00:30:26.700
<v Interviewer>Something that will astound us</v>

712
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.937
who know nothing.

713
00:30:27.937 --> 00:30:30.987
<v ->I know that if they give me the right information,</v>

714
00:30:31.936 --> 00:30:33.444
some people don't.

715
00:30:34.569 --> 00:30:38.762
They're either not aware of it and it is a problem sometimes

716
00:30:39.785 --> 00:30:42.193
but if you know you've got the right picture,

717
00:30:42.193 --> 00:30:44.976
and you know the remedy that'll fix that picture,

718
00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:46.330
and you've removed any unblocking,

719
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.483
inherited stuff and so on,

720
00:30:49.175 --> 00:30:50.948
you know it'll work.

721
00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:52.480
<v Interviewer>Well what about chronic pains?</v>

722
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.894
Say a person has chronic lower back pain, for example,

723
00:30:56.894 --> 00:30:58.598
which could be started by,

724
00:30:58.598 --> 00:31:01.357
I mean it's origin can be any number of things.

725
00:31:01.357 --> 00:31:03.745
<v ->Can be all sorts and could even be emotional, yeah.</v>

726
00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:05.485
<v Interviewer>So you just start unwinding?</v>

727
00:31:05.485 --> 00:31:08.526
<v ->The classic thing is somebody's sort of</v>

728
00:31:08.526 --> 00:31:11.730
probably done some ghastly

729
00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:14.586
extra hard work,

730
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.417
skiing or gardening or carrying heavy things

731
00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:21.428
or pushing something way beyond what they should have done

732
00:31:22.482 --> 00:31:24.510
and they sort of stagger indoors.

733
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.612
The next morning they can hardly get out of bed,

734
00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:30.237
you give a remedy and..

735
00:31:30.828 --> 00:31:32.308
<v Interviewer>And might that be something more common</v>

736
00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:33.541
like an annacar or something that we do depends?

737
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.838
<v ->That would normally be rest.</v>

738
00:31:37.112 --> 00:31:39.043
<v Interviewer>But if it has it's basis in something</v>

739
00:31:39.043 --> 00:31:40.977
much more chronic?

740
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:45.482
What about if it's something that might have to do with

741
00:31:46.357 --> 00:31:49.075
say poor nutrition, poor sleeping habits,

742
00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:50.665
not enough hydration.

743
00:31:50.665 --> 00:31:52.260
You would have to kind of assess all the way back

744
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:52.888
through all of that?

745
00:31:52.888 --> 00:31:53.868
<v ->You have to do all of that,</v>

746
00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:56.320
and one of the most common things that happens

747
00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:58.558
with businessmen and I'm quite sure that

748
00:31:58.558 --> 00:32:00.167
they don't tell their colleagues,

749
00:32:00.167 --> 00:32:02.706
is that they get diarrhea from nerves,

750
00:32:02.706 --> 00:32:04.965
and they have to stop at every garage

751
00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:06.605
on the way to a meeting,

752
00:32:06.605 --> 00:32:08.833
because they're in such a state,

753
00:32:08.833 --> 00:32:11.398
and they get to the meeting and they muddle through,

754
00:32:11.888 --> 00:32:14.482
and loads of them come for that,

755
00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:17.218
and women but at times it seems

756
00:32:17.218 --> 00:32:19.079
men are more prone to bloatedness (laughs)

757
00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:21.041
stuff that you don't wanna tell anybody,

758
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:23.088
but they have been told by their doctor,

759
00:32:23.088 --> 00:32:24.837
that they've got IBS

760
00:32:24.837 --> 00:32:26.586
because it comes and goes.

761
00:32:26.586 --> 00:32:27.278
<v Interviewer>Oh, yes.</v>

762
00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:28.759
<v ->Then they've got no more IBS</v>

763
00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:29.750
when they're done it's ridiculous..

764
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.603
<v Interviewer>It's a case of nerves.</v>

765
00:32:30.603 --> 00:32:31.702
<v ->(mumbles) nervous.</v>

766
00:32:31.702 --> 00:32:34.068
And you give them orgonite and they get better.

767
00:32:34.068 --> 00:32:35.395
I mean just like that.

768
00:32:35.712 --> 00:32:37.212
<v Interviewer>Now you're bringing up something interesting</v>

769
00:32:37.212 --> 00:32:40.178
and I don't know because you see people about everything.

770
00:32:40.178 --> 00:32:41.959
It's something I've just observed,

771
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:43.482
between men and women.

772
00:32:43.482 --> 00:32:46.638
It seems women tend to be holding more

773
00:32:46.638 --> 00:32:49.613
and tend to be more afflicted with constipation

774
00:32:49.613 --> 00:32:52.448
and men seem to be more the other way where..

775
00:32:52.448 --> 00:32:55.252
I've noticed in life around with people,

776
00:32:55.252 --> 00:32:56.669
men are always running off to the bathroom

777
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:57.883
after their first cup of coffee,

778
00:32:57.883 --> 00:33:00.678
and women are taking all these different things to try to

779
00:33:01.285 --> 00:33:02.592
urge things along.

780
00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:04.336
Is there any difference in..?

781
00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:07.013
<v ->Not really, I think I treat both equally.</v>

782
00:33:07.013 --> 00:33:08.247
<v Interviewer>You do, okay? So much for that.</v>

783
00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:11.420
<v ->They're both very debilitating from whatever you've got.</v>

784
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.185
<v Interviewer>We'll put that in the wive's tale</v>

785
00:33:13.185 --> 00:33:14.401
category then.

786
00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:15.574
So, now let's talk about..

787
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.309
<v ->Actually I just think, eczema and dramatic.</v>

788
00:33:18.309 --> 00:33:20.054
I can remember once giving a

789
00:33:20.054 --> 00:33:22.194
guy I treated for eczema for a while.

790
00:33:22.194 --> 00:33:25.842
It didn't go on and he came back a few years later

791
00:33:25.842 --> 00:33:27.677
and he walked in and said,

792
00:33:27.677 --> 00:33:29.957
"Henrietta you've got to give me something now!"

793
00:33:29.957 --> 00:33:32.047
I mean screaming in agony.

794
00:33:32.047 --> 00:33:33.911
"I've got weeping eczema all over my body

795
00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:36.186
and I'm not going to show it to you!"

796
00:33:37.845 --> 00:33:41.120
He'd gone to a pharmacist and got what he thought

797
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.566
was the right remedy.

798
00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:45.629
It was actually but I think

799
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:47.761
it had been antidoted or something.

800
00:33:48.036 --> 00:33:49.762
So I gave him a remedy,

801
00:33:49.762 --> 00:33:52.548
and he said, by the time he left,

802
00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:54.570
he was already calming down.

803
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.246
I could see it calming down.

804
00:33:57.246 --> 00:33:58.462
And you know eczema,

805
00:33:58.462 --> 00:34:00.091
people have eczema for years.

806
00:34:00.091 --> 00:34:01.148
<v Interviewer>Oh yes!</v>

807
00:34:01.148 --> 00:34:02.678
<v ->For years and years,</v>

808
00:34:02.678 --> 00:34:05.175
and they put this cortisone cream on,

809
00:34:05.175 --> 00:34:07.347
and they keep on having to put it on and it thins the skin

810
00:34:07.347 --> 00:34:09.852
and makes you look 90 when you're only 35,

811
00:34:09.852 --> 00:34:11.435
you know it's terrible.

812
00:34:12.752 --> 00:34:16.815
But he, every time I see him now for whatever,

813
00:34:16.815 --> 00:34:17.753
he comes and says,

814
00:34:17.753 --> 00:34:20.111
"I'll never forget that moment Henrietta

815
00:34:20.111 --> 00:34:22.967
when you gave me that remedy."

816
00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:24.543
<v Interviewer>To take away suffering that quickly.</v>

817
00:34:24.543 --> 00:34:26.827
<v ->He couldn't believe. He said</v>

818
00:34:27.228 --> 00:34:29.531
"That must be in my imagination that within seconds

819
00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:31.199
I started feeling better."

820
00:34:32.538 --> 00:34:33.999
I've done that with asthma types,

821
00:34:33.999 --> 00:34:35.374
you know people come in

822
00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:39.830
and they're wheezing away and

823
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.365
if it's a child the mother is saying

824
00:34:41.365 --> 00:34:43.095
'We must go to hospital!"

825
00:34:43.095 --> 00:34:45.452
I say "Good, sit down. Calm down."

826
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.436
And I can work out what they need,

827
00:34:48.436 --> 00:34:50.695
give them a remedy within 10 minutes,

828
00:34:50.695 --> 00:34:52.854
everything's calmed down and

829
00:34:52.854 --> 00:34:55.914
they walk out and the will always,

830
00:34:55.914 --> 00:34:58.684
forever have to say, "I'll never forget that moment,

831
00:34:58.684 --> 00:35:01.500
because every occasion previously,

832
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.403
I've ended up in hospital."

833
00:35:04.187 --> 00:35:06.415
And you know asthma is a very horrible,

834
00:35:06.415 --> 00:35:08.142
(in unison) very frightening.

835
00:35:08.142 --> 00:35:09.522
very frightening thing.

836
00:35:12.087 --> 00:35:13.663
I mean that's really dramatic.

837
00:35:13.663 --> 00:35:15.417
<v Interviewer>Yes it is.</v>

838
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:19.361
Henrietta what about cancer? What about tumors and the like?

839
00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:23.905
That's such a big one. The big C is the big scare.

840
00:35:23.905 --> 00:35:27.252
<v ->I have to say I'm not allowed to say</v>

841
00:35:27.252 --> 00:35:30.024
anything by law about it.

842
00:35:30.242 --> 00:35:30.605
<v Interviewer>That's true.</v>

843
00:35:30.605 --> 00:35:31.943
You're not allowed in this country to even talk about it.

844
00:35:31.943 --> 00:35:33.926
<v ->At all. I mean all I can say is..</v>

845
00:35:33.926 --> 00:35:35.748
<v Interviewer>Have you ever dealt with it and had clients?</v>

846
00:35:35.748 --> 00:35:36.421
<v ->Yes, often.</v>

847
00:35:36.421 --> 00:35:37.838
<v Interviewer>Often? Okay good.</v>

848
00:35:37.838 --> 00:35:40.039
<v ->And I've seen lumps get smaller,</v>

849
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:41.836
but I'm not allowed to say more than that.

850
00:35:43.325 --> 00:35:44.561
<v Interviewer>Okay, we will avoid that.</v>

851
00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:45.657
I know that's very touchy.

852
00:35:45.657 --> 00:35:48.399
And let's talk about that now, let's just go into it.

853
00:35:49.988 --> 00:35:53.494
In the UK I know homeopathists are having a difficult time,

854
00:35:53.494 --> 00:35:56.846
homeopaths are having a difficult time.

855
00:35:57.172 --> 00:35:59.518
There seems to be almost a concerted campaign

856
00:35:59.518 --> 00:36:01.173
to discredit them.

857
00:36:02.696 --> 00:36:05.510
I think homeopathy is more well known here,

858
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.174
generally speaking among the public,

859
00:36:07.174 --> 00:36:08.836
than it is in the United States.

860
00:36:08.836 --> 00:36:12.089
There it's just been more or less bypassed it seems,

861
00:36:12.089 --> 00:36:13.577
to a large extent.

862
00:36:15.466 --> 00:36:17.050
What is going on with that?

863
00:36:18.997 --> 00:36:21.779
<v ->It looks as though with all the current</v>

864
00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:24.222
financial situation,

865
00:36:26.462 --> 00:36:28.837
the government doesn't really want to

866
00:36:28.837 --> 00:36:31.684
fund homeopathic hospitals any more,

867
00:36:31.684 --> 00:36:34.583
and the best way to get rid of them

868
00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:37.109
is to be derogatory about homeopathy,

869
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:39.660
and run it down as much as you can,

870
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.556
and therefore a wonderful excuse to

871
00:36:44.556 --> 00:36:46.597
get a few more million to form something else

872
00:36:46.597 --> 00:36:50.858
and not waste it on homeopathy in hospitals.

873
00:36:50.858 --> 00:36:53.540
There aren't that many hospitals left in homeopathy,

874
00:36:54.509 --> 00:36:57.368
that do homeopathy and most of them are

875
00:36:58.782 --> 00:37:00.010
just out-patients.

876
00:37:00.401 --> 00:37:03.529
But nevertheless, for the people who can't afford it,

877
00:37:03.774 --> 00:37:05.357
it's very important.

878
00:37:05.736 --> 00:37:07.931
All homeopathy is private though we charge

879
00:37:07.931 --> 00:37:09.257
as little as we can.

880
00:37:11.139 --> 00:37:12.647
We do have to live (laughs)

881
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.426
<v Interviewer>True, you have to toil for yourself.</v>

882
00:37:15.426 --> 00:37:16.969
<v ->And you know for a fact that a plumber</v>

883
00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:19.059
owns considerably more than I do.

884
00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:23.635
And the way of getting rid of these hospitals

885
00:37:23.635 --> 00:37:26.373
quickly and easily, and not waste money on them

886
00:37:26.373 --> 00:37:29.273
is to be thoroughly derogatory about homeopathy.

887
00:37:29.692 --> 00:37:31.125
It is very extraordinary.

888
00:37:31.125 --> 00:37:36.125
I also think that the drug companies are very powerful,

889
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:39.390
probably not throughout the world but in my own experience

890
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:40.599
with this country.

891
00:37:40.915 --> 00:37:45.915
And they spend a lot of money on developing drugs

892
00:37:46.178 --> 00:37:49.848
and they have to go on and on developing new drugs,

893
00:37:49.848 --> 00:37:51.210
and they don't want

894
00:37:53.128 --> 00:37:56.105
homeopaths coming along and being successful,

895
00:37:57.477 --> 00:38:00.354
and they don't like it when we're successful.

896
00:38:00.564 --> 00:38:03.806
Whether they actually know that 90% of our patients

897
00:38:03.806 --> 00:38:05.715
come from people who've failed

898
00:38:05.715 --> 00:38:07.443
with conventional medicine,

899
00:38:07.443 --> 00:38:09.698
and they may have been trying conventional medicine

900
00:38:09.698 --> 00:38:11.798
for decades before they come to us,

901
00:38:11.798 --> 00:38:13.214
and then we get them better.

902
00:38:13.214 --> 00:38:15.475
Whether they actually know that I don't know,

903
00:38:15.475 --> 00:38:17.419
but it is a fact.

904
00:38:18.757 --> 00:38:21.771
We treat their failed cases,

905
00:38:21.771 --> 00:38:24.778
and if we started with people before

906
00:38:24.778 --> 00:38:27.360
they became a failed allopathic case,

907
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.208
the treatment would be quicker and easier

908
00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:33.018
and nicer and all the rest of it,

909
00:38:33.018 --> 00:38:36.216
but I'm quite sure the drug companies are very threatened

910
00:38:36.216 --> 00:38:38.111
there are more homeopaths around

911
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:41.504
than there used to be when I started out 30 years ago.

912
00:38:42.824 --> 00:38:44.805
It really wasn't very well known,

913
00:38:44.805 --> 00:38:47.170
it was in a sort of waning situation

914
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.879
and then there's been a great surge of it,

915
00:38:49.879 --> 00:38:53.300
and I think it's probably unfortunately going to wane

916
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.781
because of the bad press we've had.

917
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:57.016
<v Interviewer>Oh let's hope not.</v>

918
00:38:57.016 --> 00:38:59.256
Let's hope people have gained a little more

919
00:38:59.256 --> 00:39:00.746
understanding and sophistication.

920
00:39:00.746 --> 00:39:02.642
<v ->You know, this has gone on for years.</v>

921
00:39:02.642 --> 00:39:05.694
It's that the homeopathy works is what wins massively

922
00:39:05.694 --> 00:39:06.883
and if you look at the studies,

923
00:39:06.883 --> 00:39:09.581
study the history of it it has always happened,

924
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:11.779
and I think maybe,

925
00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:14.914
just maybe, that's what's going to happen.

926
00:39:14.914 --> 00:39:16.533
The other thing is that when

927
00:39:17.244 --> 00:39:21.063
a busy GP doing allopathic medicine

928
00:39:21.063 --> 00:39:23.760
gets a lot of information for their new drugs

929
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.100
from medical magazines.

930
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.430
Our medical magazines are rarely funded by their advertising

931
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.086
and the advertising is paid for by the drug companies,

932
00:39:32.086 --> 00:39:34.109
so they cannot ever publish

933
00:39:34.448 --> 00:39:38.467
perhaps more truthful results of some scientific experiment

934
00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:40.212
or drug testing experiment.

935
00:39:40.212 --> 00:39:42.748
They have to publish only their successes.

936
00:39:42.748 --> 00:39:45.691
Now how many failures are there for each drug?

937
00:39:46.966 --> 00:39:48.467
<v Interviewer>Well one only needs to look at the list</v>

938
00:39:48.467 --> 00:39:52.540
of side effects from each of the drugs to understand that,

939
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:55.487
which is pathetic and yet at the same time,

940
00:39:55.487 --> 00:39:57.190
my understanding if it's still true,

941
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.830
certainly the royal family has used homeopathy for..

942
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.183
<v ->They've always used homeopathy.</v>

943
00:40:01.183 --> 00:40:02.075
<v Interviewer>For a good long time.</v>

944
00:40:02.075 --> 00:40:05.490
They have access to the best and that's their choice.

945
00:40:05.647 --> 00:40:07.595
And this is true also in some of the more

946
00:40:07.595 --> 00:40:10.293
elite families and circles in the United States.

947
00:40:10.563 --> 00:40:13.102
They would't touch allopathic medicine,

948
00:40:13.102 --> 00:40:15.844
even though they may be primary

949
00:40:16.574 --> 00:40:18.817
shareholders in the drug companies for example.

950
00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:21.842
<v ->Yeah, there's a bit of a conflict there,</v>

951
00:40:21.842 --> 00:40:25.086
but when you think about it in this country,

952
00:40:25.086 --> 00:40:27.980
practically all homeopathy you have to pay for.

953
00:40:28.418 --> 00:40:31.617
Practically all allopathic stuff comes for free,

954
00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:36.547
yet people still would rather choose homeopathy,

955
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.870
those who do.

956
00:40:40.328 --> 00:40:43.184
It must be doing something pretty powerful for them

957
00:40:43.184 --> 00:40:44.810
for them to make that decision,

958
00:40:44.965 --> 00:40:48.257
when we could have meds and they don't have to pay for it.

959
00:40:48.548 --> 00:40:50.992
The other thing I find absolutely fascinating

960
00:40:50.992 --> 00:40:53.484
is an enormous percentage of my patients,

961
00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.950
are self employed.

962
00:40:55.084 --> 00:40:57.823
Self employed people cannot get ill,

963
00:40:57.823 --> 00:40:59.080
because if you're self employed,

964
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.785
particularly if you're a one man band,

965
00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:02.625
you don't get ill.

966
00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:04.539
You go on and on,

967
00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:07.100
and I find it fascinating that

968
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.158
they're nearly all self employed.

969
00:41:09.158 --> 00:41:11.182
<v Interviewer>Yes. And so again,</v>

970
00:41:11.182 --> 00:41:13.555
when you're looking at the subtlety and complexity

971
00:41:13.555 --> 00:41:15.870
of how each one of these works,

972
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.698
to have someone like you available

973
00:41:17.698 --> 00:41:19.715
where they can come to you and you can

974
00:41:20.029 --> 00:41:23.671
help them through their medical situations year after year,

975
00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:26.826
I'm envious of that,

976
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.784
that they have you and there are others like you,

977
00:41:29.784 --> 00:41:31.672
and I'm sure there are in the US,

978
00:41:31.672 --> 00:41:34.498
I just haven't come into close proximity with them yet.

979
00:41:34.798 --> 00:41:37.351
I'll ferret them out after we get back however,

980
00:41:37.351 --> 00:41:39.982
but again you're looking at you go to a doctor's office

981
00:41:39.982 --> 00:41:41.952
with say, the seasonal flu,

982
00:41:41.952 --> 00:41:44.416
whatever that might be in a particular year,

983
00:41:44.416 --> 00:41:46.504
and most of everyone that comes into their office

984
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.879
on their interval of seven to 10 minutes maximum

985
00:41:48.879 --> 00:41:50.384
they spend with the client,

986
00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:52.528
they'll tap your ear, listen to your chest,

987
00:41:52.528 --> 00:41:53.645
ask you a couple of questions,

988
00:41:53.645 --> 00:41:55.537
you all go out with the same prescription.

989
00:41:55.853 --> 00:41:58.720
It has to have varying degrees of effectiveness,

990
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.106
when it's so haphazard,

991
00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:02.270
it just the latest that the drug company has

992
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.147
brought around and sampled to the office lately,

993
00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:06.893
and with you who could be one of,

994
00:42:06.893 --> 00:42:09.855
I mean there are hundreds of homeopathic remedies literally.

995
00:42:09.855 --> 00:42:11.487
<v ->For flu, literally hundreds.</v>

996
00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:13.277
<v Interviewer>I know, it's amazing!</v>

997
00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:14.939
<v ->But you have to learn to,</v>

998
00:42:14.939 --> 00:42:16.761
well you know, homeopaths that's what we do.

999
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:20.174
We learn to recognize the drug picture

1000
00:42:20.174 --> 00:42:22.573
of somebody sitting in front of you.

1001
00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.505
The other thing that's important to remember is that

1002
00:42:24.505 --> 00:42:25.451
the iller somebody is,

1003
00:42:25.451 --> 00:42:27.468
the more acute the illness is,

1004
00:42:28.202 --> 00:42:30.226
and the more dramatic the symptoms are,

1005
00:42:30.226 --> 00:42:31.900
the stronger the symptoms are,

1006
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.716
the easier it is to choose a remedy.

1007
00:42:34.716 --> 00:42:36.771
But if somebody's just got the beginnings of a cold

1008
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.044
or a bit of an ache here or there,

1009
00:42:39.044 --> 00:42:41.377
it's actually quite difficult to choose a remedy,

1010
00:42:41.377 --> 00:42:43.936
but the minute somebody is seriously ill,

1011
00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:47.934
cholera is easier to treat than a weak or a pathetic cold.

1012
00:42:48.391 --> 00:42:49.447
<v Interviewer>That makes sense,</v>

1013
00:42:49.447 --> 00:42:51.637
there's more information there, it's very obvious.

1014
00:42:51.637 --> 00:42:53.468
<v ->And when something dramatic,</v>

1015
00:42:53.468 --> 00:42:54.979
patients come in and do the remedy.

1016
00:42:54.979 --> 00:42:56.632
They don't even know they're doing it,

1017
00:42:56.632 --> 00:42:58.407
I mean particularly small children.

1018
00:42:58.497 --> 00:42:59.561
They come in and act it out,

1019
00:42:59.561 --> 00:43:01.959
I don't have to ask any questions, just watch them.

1020
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.790
It's beautiful, really.

1021
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.207
<v Interviewer>It is. We, now here,</v>

1022
00:43:05.207 --> 00:43:07.341
we're in the fall of 2010,

1023
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:10.058
and we're coming up to flu season

1024
00:43:10.058 --> 00:43:11.733
and I know that they were,

1025
00:43:11.733 --> 00:43:14.378
you know, there was some rattling about

1026
00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.267
yet another kind of devastating flu

1027
00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:18.887
that's supposed to sweep through the United..

1028
00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:20.518
Yeah, I know, I don't get either one of us

1029
00:43:20.518 --> 00:43:22.228
confirm that one (laughs)

1030
00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.713
These devastating flus that are expected to begin

1031
00:43:25.713 --> 00:43:27.846
ravishing the population but

1032
00:43:27.846 --> 00:43:28.923
you in response to this,

1033
00:43:28.923 --> 00:43:32.020
you wrote a book called "Bird Flu: Are You Prepared?"

1034
00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.487
And it's really beyond just bird flu.

1035
00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:36.032
Can you talk about the essence of this book?

1036
00:43:36.032 --> 00:43:39.551
<v ->Well I wrote it because of all the hype about bird flu</v>

1037
00:43:40.687 --> 00:43:45.111
and really the book covers any serious flu

1038
00:43:46.903 --> 00:43:50.650
which can turn into a serious gut problem or pneumonia.

1039
00:43:51.959 --> 00:43:53.545
I don't mean just aches and pains,

1040
00:43:53.545 --> 00:43:55.841
you can have pretty horrible aches and pains too,

1041
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:59.039
but those are the three different types that people can get.

1042
00:43:59.039 --> 00:44:01.375
More than one type all in one go.

1043
00:44:04.852 --> 00:44:08.051
Basically what I've done in that book is a little bit

1044
00:44:08.051 --> 00:44:09.965
of explanation about homeopathy

1045
00:44:09.965 --> 00:44:11.768
and it's history of homeopathy,

1046
00:44:11.768 --> 00:44:14.544
and a bit of a lesson on how you prescribe,

1047
00:44:14.544 --> 00:44:16.277
how you choose your remedy.

1048
00:44:17.308 --> 00:44:19.544
When to stop a remedy, when to start a remedy,

1049
00:44:19.544 --> 00:44:20.716
when to change a remedy,

1050
00:44:20.716 --> 00:44:23.206
when to go up in potency and all this kind of thing,

1051
00:44:23.978 --> 00:44:27.646
but the chief thing is learning to choose a similar remedy,

1052
00:44:27.646 --> 00:44:29.937
cause if you don't choose a similar remedy,

1053
00:44:29.937 --> 00:44:31.386
you're not going to get anywhere.

1054
00:44:31.386 --> 00:44:32.229
And a lot of people say

1055
00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:34.830
"Oh homeopathy didn't work. I took bryonia for my cough

1056
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:35.661
and it didn't work!"

1057
00:44:35.661 --> 00:44:37.677
And I say, "What kind of cough was it?"

1058
00:44:37.677 --> 00:44:39.074
And they say, "It's very loose

1059
00:44:39.074 --> 00:44:40.073
and I was coughing out green stuff."

1060
00:44:40.073 --> 00:44:42.759
I said, 'Uh uh. Bryonia is not loose

1061
00:44:42.759 --> 00:44:44.488
and it does not cough up green stuff.

1062
00:44:44.488 --> 00:44:45.797
Byronia is a very dry cough

1063
00:44:45.925 --> 00:44:48.762
that you cough the minute you move, or talk or eat,

1064
00:44:50.457 --> 00:44:52.247
and you're very thirsty and things like that,

1065
00:44:52.247 --> 00:44:54.167
but if you keep still,

1066
00:44:54.167 --> 00:44:55.882
you don't cough and it travels

1067
00:44:55.882 --> 00:44:57.169
very quickly down to your lungs.

1068
00:44:57.169 --> 00:45:00.043
That is a bryonia cough. Not what you've got."

1069
00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:01.838
And people are very quick to say,

1070
00:45:01.838 --> 00:45:03.405
"Oh, homeopathy didn't work for me,"

1071
00:45:03.776 --> 00:45:05.642
but they basically took the wrong remedy.

1072
00:45:05.642 --> 00:45:08.287
And the wrong remedy which is not similar,

1073
00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:10.360
will never work. It can't work.

1074
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.066
<v Interviewer>Obviously a person needs to be able to</v>

1075
00:45:14.066 --> 00:45:15.919
understand their own symptoms better

1076
00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:18.393
which I would guess that's partly why you wrote these books

1077
00:45:18.393 --> 00:45:21.065
because not everybody is going to get to a homeopath

1078
00:45:21.065 --> 00:45:24.477
but still wants the benefit of using the remedies.

1079
00:45:26.353 --> 00:45:28.530
Let's talk about a person that,

1080
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.213
say it's flu season now,

1081
00:45:30.213 --> 00:45:31.897
and you start feeling the normal symptoms,

1082
00:45:31.897 --> 00:45:34.294
let's say it's the chesty kind of flu,

1083
00:45:34.294 --> 00:45:37.558
really nasty, ravaging the bronchioles and so forth.

1084
00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:40.035
What would you have a person do?

1085
00:45:42.044 --> 00:45:44.455
<v ->It doesn't really matter what the symptoms are,</v>

1086
00:45:44.455 --> 00:45:45.909
but the..

1087
00:45:47.407 --> 00:45:49.881
In my book I've explained for you good people,

1088
00:45:49.881 --> 00:45:52.468
you write down a list of your symptoms,

1089
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:55.286
and if you write down a list of your symptoms you will

1090
00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.107
inevitably write down the things that you find

1091
00:45:57.107 --> 00:45:59.102
most unpleasant first so we know

1092
00:45:59.102 --> 00:46:02.780
in order of importance of things already, what's going on.

1093
00:46:03.473 --> 00:46:06.308
Then you have to take each sypmtom

1094
00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:11.308
and look at it in a homeopathic way like,

1095
00:46:11.555 --> 00:46:14.892
does the position I sit in make a difference?

1096
00:46:14.892 --> 00:46:17.293
Or what position am I sitting in?

1097
00:46:17.293 --> 00:46:19.734
Do I want to lie down, am I walking around,

1098
00:46:19.734 --> 00:46:21.388
am I sitting still?

1099
00:46:21.682 --> 00:46:23.941
Do I want the curtains drawn and lie in the dark

1100
00:46:23.941 --> 00:46:26.436
or do I want the lights on and the curtains open,

1101
00:46:26.436 --> 00:46:28.101
do I want fresh air?

1102
00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:30.253
Do I want to be warmed, I want to be covered up?

1103
00:46:30.253 --> 00:46:31.443
Do I not want to be covered up?

1104
00:46:31.443 --> 00:46:34.899
Have I got a raging fever and still want to be covered up?

1105
00:46:34.899 --> 00:46:36.381
How peculiar is that?

1106
00:46:37.425 --> 00:46:39.174
Do I want to put my head out of the window

1107
00:46:39.174 --> 00:46:41.418
and have fresh air but be covered up?

1108
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:44.609
What color are the discharges?

1109
00:46:44.609 --> 00:46:47.212
Or are they bland or acrid,

1110
00:46:47.862 --> 00:46:49.498
what kind of pain,

1111
00:46:49.813 --> 00:46:51.646
and you have to think of every kind of pain

1112
00:46:51.646 --> 00:46:54.095
and then you do want to rub that pain or not rub that pain,

1113
00:46:54.095 --> 00:46:57.144
or bandage that pain or put something cold on that pain

1114
00:46:57.144 --> 00:46:58.562
or something warm on that pain.

1115
00:46:58.562 --> 00:47:03.116
Anyway, the modalities, the questions are endless,

1116
00:47:03.116 --> 00:47:06.132
but usually you come up with quite a number

1117
00:47:06.132 --> 00:47:09.043
of really strong symptoms,

1118
00:47:09.043 --> 00:47:11.028
which as I said in that book,

1119
00:47:11.688 --> 00:47:12.768
you can fill in a chart.

1120
00:47:12.768 --> 00:47:15.450
It's got all the possible remedies or

1121
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.275
the most likely remedies for a nasty flu.

1122
00:47:18.275 --> 00:47:21.302
You fill them in and you will see a number

1123
00:47:21.302 --> 00:47:23.818
of remedies most strongly indicated,

1124
00:47:23.818 --> 00:47:26.356
and at that stage you then look at those

1125
00:47:27.046 --> 00:47:29.498
say three remedies and you'll realize one of them is,

1126
00:47:29.498 --> 00:47:30.979
actually doesn't really fit.

1127
00:47:31.318 --> 00:47:34.288
Then you look at the other two and you make a decision.

1128
00:47:34.827 --> 00:47:37.045
The reason I wrote the book really,

1129
00:47:37.045 --> 00:47:41.248
is because people who are into homeopathy

1130
00:47:41.248 --> 00:47:42.279
need more knowledge.

1131
00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:45.126
One needs to educate the general public

1132
00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:48.465
in the things that they can do themselves,

1133
00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:50.374
not in the things they can't do.

1134
00:47:50.374 --> 00:47:51.771
You shouldn't, for instance,

1135
00:47:51.771 --> 00:47:56.448
treat your cuts or your cirrhosis or your asthma yourself.

1136
00:47:56.696 --> 00:47:58.253
You should go to a homeopath.

1137
00:47:58.253 --> 00:48:00.010
You will get very disappointing results

1138
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:00.819
(interviewer laughs and agrees)

1139
00:48:00.819 --> 00:48:02.815
but when it comes to a flu or measles

1140
00:48:02.815 --> 00:48:04.564
or mumps or whatever,

1141
00:48:05.004 --> 00:48:06.641
you can do it yourself,

1142
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:09.445
if you learn to do it properly.

1143
00:48:09.445 --> 00:48:12.688
And that's what this book is instructing people to do.

1144
00:48:12.688 --> 00:48:14.233
The other thing you've got to understand is that

1145
00:48:14.233 --> 00:48:15.868
in a pandemic,

1146
00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:18.903
if it is as bad as we would like to believe,

1147
00:48:18.903 --> 00:48:21.288
and we have no idea whether it

1148
00:48:21.288 --> 00:48:22.738
would have been or could be,

1149
00:48:22.738 --> 00:48:24.944
but probably could be,

1150
00:48:24.944 --> 00:48:26.601
we have to be ready, see.

1151
00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:29.641
To think that anybody would get to hospital,

1152
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.100
because the hospitals would be full.

1153
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.012
To think that anybody is ever going to come and rescue you

1154
00:48:36.012 --> 00:48:38.234
when in a bad pandemic,

1155
00:48:38.773 --> 00:48:40.703
you know, dream on. They won't.

1156
00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:43.248
I mean, look at these poor wretched people in Pakistan,

1157
00:48:43.248 --> 00:48:46.287
they've all got cholera from the floods and (mumbles)

1158
00:48:46.937 --> 00:48:51.358
It takes forever to get to rescue people in a disaster,

1159
00:48:51.358 --> 00:48:54.684
and when you've got a pandemic, a flu,

1160
00:48:54.684 --> 00:48:58.220
half the people who will come rescue you probably got flu.

1161
00:48:58.748 --> 00:49:01.775
And when you look at the flu of 19,

1162
00:49:01.775 --> 00:49:03.802
when was it 1918? Whenever it was.

1163
00:49:04.997 --> 00:49:07.523
Something like 50% of those, over 50% of those

1164
00:49:07.523 --> 00:49:08.882
who got it died.

1165
00:49:09.507 --> 00:49:10.946
That's a lot of people.

1166
00:49:10.946 --> 00:49:12.599
And they died very quickly.

1167
00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:15.049
You know, you could fall ill at 10 o'clock on Monday morning

1168
00:49:15.049 --> 00:49:17.044
and be dead by Tuesday night.

1169
00:49:17.994 --> 00:49:20.700
There isn't time, and you've got to have

1170
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.463
you remedies at home, in the right potencies.

1171
00:49:23.463 --> 00:49:24.611
You can't send off for them

1172
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:26.157
and then three days later they arrive,

1173
00:49:26.157 --> 00:49:27.274
it could be too late,

1174
00:49:27.274 --> 00:49:29.044
which is why I've written that book.

1175
00:49:29.044 --> 00:49:31.658
Because you can have the remedies in your house,

1176
00:49:31.658 --> 00:49:34.576
you can use them, you can read it long before

1177
00:49:34.576 --> 00:49:36.110
the pandemic comes.

1178
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:37.056
<v Interviewer>And get some of them being (cut short)</v>

1179
00:49:37.056 --> 00:49:39.967
<v ->You can get familiar with using homeopathy</v>

1180
00:49:39.967 --> 00:49:40.995
for little things.

1181
00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:47.843
People learn by just doing it, basically.

1182
00:49:47.843 --> 00:49:50.872
And they learn, they treat their children for teething,

1183
00:49:50.872 --> 00:49:53.622
or for a fever or something,

1184
00:49:53.622 --> 00:49:56.406
or ear ache and all that kind of thing which is in my

1185
00:49:56.406 --> 00:49:57.910
other book, that one.

1186
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.898
And people learn what kind of personalities

1187
00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:04.294
and what kind of remedies suit their children

1188
00:50:04.294 --> 00:50:06.761
or their husband or like whatever.

1189
00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:10.411
We'll always have those remedies in the house anyway,

1190
00:50:10.411 --> 00:50:12.383
and you know most of them won't go anywhere without them.

1191
00:50:12.383 --> 00:50:13.930
They won't go on holiday without them,

1192
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.018
they wont, you know, move without them

1193
00:50:16.018 --> 00:50:17.845
in their handbag or something,

1194
00:50:18.587 --> 00:50:20.751
but with this flu thing,

1195
00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:23.663
you need remedies possibly in much higher potencies,

1196
00:50:23.663 --> 00:50:26.063
possibly remedies you've never used before,

1197
00:50:26.063 --> 00:50:29.132
and in this book it's explaining all of that.

1198
00:50:29.132 --> 00:50:31.553
<v Interviewer>So it's called "Bird Flu: Are You Prepared?"</v>

1199
00:50:31.553 --> 00:50:32.706
Where can they get the book?

1200
00:50:34.612 --> 00:50:36.306
<v ->Mostly just from me actually, that one.</v>

1201
00:50:36.306 --> 00:50:37.523
<v Interviewer>Okay we'll put the information..</v>

1202
00:50:37.523 --> 00:50:39.005
<v ->And I think it's on the internet.</v>

1203
00:50:39.005 --> 00:50:40.071
<v Interviewer>We will put the information..</v>

1204
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:42.527
<v ->I think it's on the internet as well.</v>

1205
00:50:46.128 --> 00:50:49.805
It is written for people who have no knowledge of homeopathy

1206
00:50:49.805 --> 00:50:51.311
that one because,

1207
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.991
a lot of people make a mistake with homeopathy

1208
00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:59.859
of just looking at the remedy pictures and saying

1209
00:50:59.859 --> 00:51:01.606
"Oh, no it's not that one, or this one.

1210
00:51:01.606 --> 00:51:03.855
Oh yes it's that one! let's go for that one."

1211
00:51:03.855 --> 00:51:06.544
And what they haven't done is take the case properly,

1212
00:51:06.544 --> 00:51:08.165
analyze it properly,

1213
00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.605
and choose a remedy properly,

1214
00:51:09.605 --> 00:51:12.639
and unless you do it in the way I tell you how to do it,

1215
00:51:12.639 --> 00:51:14.879
which is how we do it as homeopaths,

1216
00:51:14.879 --> 00:51:16.649
you will miss out important symptoms,

1217
00:51:16.649 --> 00:51:18.193
you won't get the similar remedy

1218
00:51:18.193 --> 00:51:19.548
and you won't get better.

1219
00:51:19.548 --> 00:51:21.414
You have to do it properly,

1220
00:51:21.414 --> 00:51:23.972
and a lot of people with sort of minor things

1221
00:51:23.972 --> 00:51:25.263
don't do it properly,

1222
00:51:25.263 --> 00:51:28.569
and I spent a lot of time boringly lecturing my patients,

1223
00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:30.903
saying that they've done it all wrong and how to do it right

1224
00:51:30.903 --> 00:51:31.490
which they don't all,

1225
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.237
some like and some hate me saying that,

1226
00:51:33.237 --> 00:51:34.166
but they learn.

1227
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.894
The whole point of being a homeopath,

1228
00:51:35.894 --> 00:51:37.139
you're not just getting people better,

1229
00:51:37.139 --> 00:51:38.952
you are actually educating them

1230
00:51:38.952 --> 00:51:41.117
to use homeopathy in their home,

1231
00:51:41.117 --> 00:51:44.232
because if you can use it for acute things,

1232
00:51:44.232 --> 00:51:48.726
you actually prevent a lot of chronic things developing.

1233
00:51:51.556 --> 00:51:54.340
Both those books are written for acute things

1234
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.701
and not for chronic things.

1235
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:57.770
I don''t touch chronic things,

1236
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.534
although a lot of homeopaths do,

1237
00:52:00.772 --> 00:52:04.024
and I think it's a mistake that actually,

1238
00:52:04.024 --> 00:52:04.776
because you need to know..

1239
00:52:04.776 --> 00:52:05.471
<v Interviewer>Too complex..</v>

1240
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.062
<v ->so much, there's so much inherited stuff,</v>

1241
00:52:09.062 --> 00:52:12.046
it's very difficult to analyze yourself emotionally.

1242
00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:14.640
It must resound honest enough with ourselves

1243
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.495
to do that well enough,

1244
00:52:16.495 --> 00:52:19.074
and I treat lot's of homeopaths.

1245
00:52:19.147 --> 00:52:22.070
They don't treat themselves, they come to someone else.

1246
00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:25.403
If you could treat yourself you would

1247
00:52:25.738 --> 00:52:27.786
for something like that, but on their own,

1248
00:52:27.786 --> 00:52:29.918
people recognize that that's not a good idea.

1249
00:52:29.918 --> 00:52:31.400
<v Interviewer>Well now, let's say,</v>

1250
00:52:32.496 --> 00:52:35.663
we'll have the information available so people can

1251
00:52:35.663 --> 00:52:38.134
find the books which I think is important right now.

1252
00:52:38.134 --> 00:52:40.586
We really need to take personal responsibility

1253
00:52:40.586 --> 00:52:42.740
on every level for our own health now..

1254
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.565
<v ->I mean that is actually what homeopathy does.</v>

1255
00:52:45.565 --> 00:52:48.443
It makes people take responsibility themselves

1256
00:52:48.443 --> 00:52:50.555
and not be relying on other people,

1257
00:52:50.555 --> 00:52:52.367
not at every sneeze rushing off to the doctor

1258
00:52:52.367 --> 00:52:53.655
and saying "Help me."

1259
00:52:53.655 --> 00:52:56.113
You know, you stop and think and do something,

1260
00:52:56.427 --> 00:52:58.692
and actually it empowers people.

1261
00:52:59.316 --> 00:53:00.862
<v Interviewer>Yes it does empower people.</v>

1262
00:53:01.416 --> 00:53:03.591
I was going to ask you if you would just share

1263
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:05.414
a few of the absolute No-No's.

1264
00:53:05.414 --> 00:53:07.195
Let's say someone is watching this

1265
00:53:07.195 --> 00:53:08.462
from somewhere in the world,

1266
00:53:08.462 --> 00:53:11.062
and they have a stash of homeopathic remedies

1267
00:53:11.062 --> 00:53:13.121
they picked up somewhere along the way and they think,

1268
00:53:13.121 --> 00:53:16.811
"Oh gosh! The next time this thing happens I'll use it!"

1269
00:53:16.811 --> 00:53:19.456
But there are some things that you really shouldn't do,

1270
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:23.569
like coffee, and some of the No-No's.

1271
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:25.455
<v ->There are certain things which antidote</v>

1272
00:53:25.455 --> 00:53:27.028
homeopathic remedies,

1273
00:53:27.268 --> 00:53:29.921
and they only antidote them because the remedies

1274
00:53:29.921 --> 00:53:31.377
are in a potency.

1275
00:53:31.554 --> 00:53:32.613
It's a very..

1276
00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.053
Because you're dealing with an energy,

1277
00:53:38.053 --> 00:53:39.904
it is very easy to antidote,

1278
00:53:39.904 --> 00:53:42.250
and it's not a material substance.

1279
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.771
That is the reason why they're easily antidoted.

1280
00:53:45.054 --> 00:53:46.413
The coffee thing

1281
00:53:47.721 --> 00:53:49.491
Hahnemann was very hot about

1282
00:53:49.491 --> 00:53:51.362
and quite rightly so.

1283
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:55.324
Most people coffee antidotes, the remedies.

1284
00:53:55.324 --> 00:53:58.363
If you happen to be one of those very rare people

1285
00:53:58.363 --> 00:54:01.146
who can drink a really strong cup of coffee

1286
00:54:01.146 --> 00:54:04.805
at two in the morning and go straight to bed and fall asleep

1287
00:54:04.805 --> 00:54:07.244
probably coffee won't antidote your remedies.

1288
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:09.356
But I've only ever had two patients like that

1289
00:54:09.356 --> 00:54:11.041
in all of my time doing this.

1290
00:54:11.594 --> 00:54:15.817
It is very unusual. Coffee does markup remedies completely,

1291
00:54:15.817 --> 00:54:20.817
peppermint does, menthol, eucalyptus, camphor,

1292
00:54:22.132 --> 00:54:24.061
and if you think about what those things are,

1293
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:28.512
they're very strong smells.

1294
00:54:29.337 --> 00:54:31.619
The other thing you mustn't do is ever take

1295
00:54:31.619 --> 00:54:33.644
the lid off a remedy bottle,

1296
00:54:33.644 --> 00:54:35.917
say in the kitchen while your husband or wife

1297
00:54:35.917 --> 00:54:38.101
is peeling onions because the smell of that

1298
00:54:38.101 --> 00:54:38.954
could just wipe out the remedy.

1299
00:54:38.954 --> 00:54:41.438
<v Interviewer>Oh it changes it energetically, yes.</v>

1300
00:54:41.438 --> 00:54:43.624
<v ->On the whole, once you get into the..</v>

1301
00:54:43.624 --> 00:54:45.574
It sounds, you know, frightfully complicated and boring

1302
00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:48.422
but on the whole, once you've got used to the idea,

1303
00:54:48.422 --> 00:54:49.753
it's perfectly simple.

1304
00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:53.924
The only thing that can be very difficult is when you get,

1305
00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:56.643
say a wife who's perfectly keen on homeopathy,

1306
00:54:56.643 --> 00:54:59.672
so she drops off with her children to the local homeopath.

1307
00:54:59.672 --> 00:55:01.697
The father thinks it's a load of bankum,

1308
00:55:01.697 --> 00:55:04.119
so spends his whole life giving the children peppermints,

1309
00:55:04.119 --> 00:55:06.304
encouraging them to eat peppermints.

1310
00:55:07.295 --> 00:55:08.167
That is very tiresome,

1311
00:55:08.167 --> 00:55:09.421
<v Interviewer>That family dynamic, yes.</v>

1312
00:55:09.421 --> 00:55:11.126
<v ->and when that happens and the children</v>

1313
00:55:11.126 --> 00:55:12.661
are a little bit older,

1314
00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:14.507
they can get very bolshy about homeopathy

1315
00:55:14.507 --> 00:55:16.743
because they've had this dispute going on.

1316
00:55:16.743 --> 00:55:19.036
This is not good within a family,

1317
00:55:19.036 --> 00:55:20.949
I do not like that happening.

1318
00:55:21.541 --> 00:55:24.495
The other thing that completely can wreck homeopathy

1319
00:55:24.495 --> 00:55:28.585
is radiation from mobiles and X-rays,

1320
00:55:28.922 --> 00:55:33.588
and computers, laptops when they're not,

1321
00:55:34.489 --> 00:55:36.866
I mean it doesn't come down the telephone line,

1322
00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:38.412
you know, or whatever the call them.

1323
00:55:39.307 --> 00:55:40.385
I don't have one like that

1324
00:55:40.385 --> 00:55:41.055
so I can't remember what they're called (laughs)

1325
00:55:41.055 --> 00:55:41.865
<v Interviewer>Wireless.</v>

1326
00:55:41.865 --> 00:55:43.145
<v ->That's right! Wireless.</v>

1327
00:55:45.048 --> 00:55:48.301
You mustn't be within a meter of a mobile that's switched on

1328
00:55:48.301 --> 00:55:50.391
and the same for wireless computers,

1329
00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:53.659
because it will markup the remedies.

1330
00:55:55.641 --> 00:55:57.887
The other thing that is very problematic

1331
00:55:57.887 --> 00:55:59.103
for people who travel a lot

1332
00:55:59.103 --> 00:56:00.950
is the X-rays at security at airports..

1333
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:02.322
<v Interviewer>I was just going to ask you..</v>

1334
00:56:02.802 --> 00:56:06.502
<v ->because if your remedy goes through the X-ray thing,</v>

1335
00:56:06.502 --> 00:56:10.047
the first zapping will contract it by about,

1336
00:56:10.895 --> 00:56:13.790
well, a percentage. It will be less efficient,

1337
00:56:13.967 --> 00:56:16.830
and the the second zapping, it's pretty much wiped out.

1338
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:20.142
It slightly depends on the potency cause our higher potency

1339
00:56:20.142 --> 00:56:23.395
are more easily damaged than say a 12C or something.

1340
00:56:23.395 --> 00:56:25.917
<v Interviewer>Oh interesting. Guess that makes sense.</v>

1341
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:27.500
<v ->But the fact remains it does,</v>

1342
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.228
and one of the difficulties is

1343
00:56:29.228 --> 00:56:30.935
people who are very homeopathic

1344
00:56:30.935 --> 00:56:32.865
always have their little kit with them,

1345
00:56:32.865 --> 00:56:34.603
and it goes with them everywhere,

1346
00:56:34.603 --> 00:56:36.982
and this kit actually, when you think about it,

1347
00:56:36.982 --> 00:56:39.316
say you've got 40 remedies or something in there,

1348
00:56:39.316 --> 00:56:41.023
it actually comes to quite a lot of money.

1349
00:56:41.023 --> 00:56:43.102
And if every time you go through an airport

1350
00:56:43.102 --> 00:56:46.152
you're going to have to have a scene with the security men,

1351
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:48.274
it's really frustrating.

1352
00:56:48.274 --> 00:56:49.148
<v Interviewer>So that is the problem?</v>

1353
00:56:49.148 --> 00:56:52.433
<v ->And some of these people will not let you through,</v>

1354
00:56:52.433 --> 00:56:54.501
they say, "Either it's X-rayed,

1355
00:56:54.501 --> 00:56:57.268
or you don't get on the plane. Simple as that."

1356
00:56:57.327 --> 00:57:00.474
And that is very terrible because it's expensive,

1357
00:57:00.474 --> 00:57:03.236
and we probably will have a lousy holiday

1358
00:57:03.236 --> 00:57:05.649
if we leave them behind, because you're dependent on them.

1359
00:57:08.534 --> 00:57:11.841
What we tend to do which helps just for daily life

1360
00:57:11.841 --> 00:57:14.806
is to keep our remedies in a lead bag,

1361
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:16.553
which is great, you know,

1362
00:57:16.553 --> 00:57:18.398
if you go to a supermarket and you can happen

1363
00:57:18.398 --> 00:57:21.350
to always have a few remedies in your handbag in there,

1364
00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.112
so everybody can talk on their mobiles next to it,

1365
00:57:24.112 --> 00:57:25.637
and you can be relaxed and be fine,

1366
00:57:25.637 --> 00:57:27.064
or in the office or in your home or whatever.

1367
00:57:27.064 --> 00:57:28.869
<v Interviewer>What about going through security</v>

1368
00:57:28.869 --> 00:57:29.680
with a lead bag?

1369
00:57:30.326 --> 00:57:32.970
<v ->No. You must not let them go through security</v>

1370
00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.250
with the lead bag because what happens,

1371
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.437
say you have done so,

1372
00:57:37.437 --> 00:57:41.702
they see this thing that shows up on

1373
00:57:41.702 --> 00:57:42.619
and they say "What is that?"

1374
00:57:42.619 --> 00:57:46.480
They turn the dial up higher and zap them more,

1375
00:57:47.312 --> 00:57:50.138
so what you have to do is take them out of the lead bag,

1376
00:57:50.138 --> 00:57:52.271
have a little row with the guy,

1377
00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:54.479
the security man and hope you win,

1378
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:58.376
and then put them back in afterwards.

1379
00:57:58.732 --> 00:58:00.875
The other thing that some people do if the're feeling

1380
00:58:00.875 --> 00:58:02.400
they can't stand the row,

1381
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.226
is to just take a few remedies with them,

1382
00:58:05.226 --> 00:58:09.130
and throw them away when they come home because they wont..

1383
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:10.804
It's very difficult because you know

1384
00:58:10.804 --> 00:58:14.173
people with heart conditions or asthma or

1385
00:58:15.933 --> 00:58:17.747
tend to get tummy bugs

1386
00:58:18.062 --> 00:58:19.139
if they're away or something,

1387
00:58:19.139 --> 00:58:20.727
their whole holidays can be ruined.

1388
00:58:20.727 --> 00:58:22.103
They don't want to take the drug,

1389
00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:23.857
it is very trying.

1390
00:58:24.599 --> 00:58:27.489
One of the boring things the security men say,

1391
00:58:27.489 --> 00:58:30.699
"Oh the radiation in the sky when you're 30 thousand feet up

1392
00:58:30.699 --> 00:58:31.669
is just as bad."

1393
00:58:31.669 --> 00:58:33.802
Now this is an absolute load of piffle,

1394
00:58:33.802 --> 00:58:37.279
because if it were, all the pilots would be dead.

1395
00:58:38.822 --> 00:58:41.916
Why do radiographers when they X-ray you,

1396
00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:44.050
when you have an X-ray run out of the room?

1397
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.830
You know, they couldn't move quick enough, could they?

1398
00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:49.148
<v Interviewer>It's that lead shielding on.</v>

1399
00:58:49.389 --> 00:58:52.333
<v ->Statistically they cancer despite them running away,</v>

1400
00:58:52.333 --> 00:58:54.375
and statistically the cancer in radio is often much higher

1401
00:58:54.375 --> 00:58:56.827
than any other medical profession,

1402
00:58:57.648 --> 00:58:59.209
any others in the medical profession.

1403
00:59:00.634 --> 00:59:02.884
You cannot say the pilots are dropping down dead,

1404
00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:03.896
or air hostesses dropping down dead

1405
00:59:03.896 --> 00:59:05.293
from radiation in the sky,

1406
00:59:05.293 --> 00:59:07.103
and this shows that people do not understand

1407
00:59:07.103 --> 00:59:09.107
about the different wavelengths

1408
00:59:09.107 --> 00:59:12.564
of X-rays and radiation,

1409
00:59:12.564 --> 00:59:14.619
you know, they're different strengths.

1410
00:59:14.619 --> 00:59:17.589
I think when my elder brother was a kid,

1411
00:59:18.757 --> 00:59:20.549
he's older than me I just had to point out,

1412
00:59:21.177 --> 00:59:25.080
when you had your shoes fitted in a shoe shop,

1413
00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.893
you put your feet in an X-ray thing

1414
00:59:26.893 --> 00:59:29.857
so you could see where the bones were, without your toes,

1415
00:59:29.857 --> 00:59:32.745
in relation to the shoes to see whether they fitted,

1416
00:59:32.745 --> 00:59:34.738
and then they realized how dangerous it was

1417
00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:36.358
and they stopped them, thank goodness!

1418
00:59:36.358 --> 00:59:36.880
<v Interviewer>Thank goodness!</v>

1419
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.186
I've never heard of that one.

1420
00:59:38.448 --> 00:59:40.323
Well so we're just..

1421
00:59:40.323 --> 00:59:42.167
(both speakers laugh and mumble)

1422
00:59:42.167 --> 00:59:44.832
<v ->Yes, 60th birthday last year so, yeah.</v>

1423
00:59:45.996 --> 00:59:47.308
That was stopped.

1424
00:59:47.308 --> 00:59:48.001
<v Interviewer>Goodness!</v>

1425
00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:50.863
<v ->And now this latest thing, because of</v>

1426
00:59:51.392 --> 00:59:53.770
all this ghastly terrorism,

1427
00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:55.594
is that people appear to be,

1428
00:59:55.594 --> 00:59:59.338
being some kind of scanner which they're calling a scanner,

1429
00:59:59.338 --> 01:00:01.859
but has to be an X-ray of some kind.

1430
01:00:04.745 --> 01:00:06.621
It's not good.

1431
01:00:07.319 --> 01:00:09.088
<v Interviewer>We have to find our own way,</v>

1432
01:00:09.088 --> 01:00:11.616
if we're using homeopathy and we're travelling

1433
01:00:11.616 --> 01:00:13.698
we'll have to figure this out and you've given us

1434
01:00:13.698 --> 01:00:14.207
some ideas.

1435
01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:15.956
<v ->I do have to say, sometimes it's good.</v>

1436
01:00:15.956 --> 01:00:18.064
I remember once travelling from,

1437
01:00:18.064 --> 01:00:19.342
I can't remember where it was,

1438
01:00:19.342 --> 01:00:21.070
it was about five in the morning as it always is

1439
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:22.477
when one's getting on an airplane.

1440
01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:27.357
And the security guy saw my stuff, his whole face lit up,

1441
01:00:27.618 --> 01:00:29.805
and said, "Oh yes! We all use it! (gasps)

1442
01:00:29.805 --> 01:00:30.784
What have you got here?"

1443
01:00:30.784 --> 01:00:32.808
He went through them and then he started asking me

1444
01:00:32.808 --> 01:00:35.132
about I think his wife's illness or something,

1445
01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:37.051
and you know it was at five o'clock in the morning

1446
01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:39.408
and was actually, completely on the ball.

1447
01:00:39.408 --> 01:00:41.358
But it was quite funny, it was complete contrast

1448
01:00:41.358 --> 01:00:43.578
to all the other hassle I normally get.

1449
01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:46.653
<v Interviewer>We won't count on that happening..</v>

1450
01:00:46.724 --> 01:00:47.800
<v ->No you can't. (both speakers laugh)</v>

1451
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.221
<v Interviewer>Well, any final thoughts, Henrietta?</v>

1452
01:00:50.221 --> 01:00:52.675
It's just a fascinating topic and you have some

1453
01:00:52.675 --> 01:00:54.199
resources for people to use

1454
01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:56.480
and I assume you'll also recommend some of the companies

1455
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.248
that are really,

1456
01:00:58.023 --> 01:01:00.669
creating high quality remedies as well, right?

1457
01:01:01.019 --> 01:01:02.176
<v ->Not in this country.</v>

1458
01:01:02.437 --> 01:01:03.896
<v Interviewer>In this book, and for this country.</v>

1459
01:01:03.896 --> 01:01:05.900
And then people will have to do a little research

1460
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.943
and people watching this

1461
01:01:06.943 --> 01:01:08.991
are very prone toward research anyway,

1462
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:11.608
so any final thoughts?

1463
01:01:12.329 --> 01:01:15.463
<v ->The homeopathic pharmacists in this country are Helios</v>

1464
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.818
in Turnbridge Wells, that's a very good one,

1465
01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:20.608
Freeman's in Glasgow, that's a good one.

1466
01:01:21.607 --> 01:01:23.707
Ainsworth's in London,

1467
01:01:24.078 --> 01:01:27.271
there's one called Gail in Dorchester.

1468
01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:31.038
they're the main ones we use and they each have

1469
01:01:31.685 --> 01:01:33.744
different strengths for the remedies.

1470
01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:36.541
As a homeopath one uses one for one thing

1471
01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:37.764
and another for another thing

1472
01:01:37.764 --> 01:01:40.409
because they will do slightly different things but

1473
01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:42.905
they're all reputable and reliable,

1474
01:01:42.905 --> 01:01:44.404
and very good suppliers.

1475
01:01:44.404 --> 01:01:46.356
<v Interviewer>So for our English viewers,</v>

1476
01:01:46.356 --> 01:01:47.320
there you go.

1477
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:50.192
And also, they do send to overseas?

1478
01:01:50.192 --> 01:01:52.190
<v ->They send them all over abroad..</v>

1479
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:53.861
<v Interviewer>So we can use that in the states</v>

1480
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:55.319
and other countries in Europe.

1481
01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:57.569
<v ->But I do know there are some websites in the states</v>

1482
01:01:57.569 --> 01:01:59.617
with some very peculiar remedies,

1483
01:01:59.617 --> 01:02:01.921
and I emailed one saying

1484
01:02:01.921 --> 01:02:03.253
"What is this you're talking about?"

1485
01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:05.365
and got such a peculiar reply.

1486
01:02:07.188 --> 01:02:09.321
So, you gotta be careful, to get the right thing.

1487
01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:11.277
<v Interviewer>Stick to the local ones.</v>

1488
01:02:12.168 --> 01:02:13.960
Before we wrap up our conversation

1489
01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.028
are there any final thoughts that

1490
01:02:16.028 --> 01:02:18.674
we haven't covered yet that people need to understand

1491
01:02:18.674 --> 01:02:20.748
as they go on this journey of

1492
01:02:21.169 --> 01:02:23.136
exploring homeopathy?

1493
01:02:29.497 --> 01:02:31.363
<v ->Just don't go on poisoning yourselves</v>

1494
01:02:31.363 --> 01:02:33.063
with conventional drugs,

1495
01:02:33.687 --> 01:02:36.480
because homeopathy is safe and it works

1496
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.935
if you do it properly.

1497
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:39.987
And it's always worth trying.

1498
01:02:39.987 --> 01:02:43.207
I might also add that, even if things look,

1499
01:02:43.586 --> 01:02:46.507
somebody is really ill, something grim,

1500
01:02:46.507 --> 01:02:49.005
and everyone's given up,

1501
01:02:50.194 --> 01:02:53.627
on one level homeopathy for the dying

1502
01:02:53.627 --> 01:02:56.618
can make dying much more comfortable,

1503
01:02:57.476 --> 01:02:59.096
and that is very important.

1504
01:02:59.096 --> 01:03:00.664
And the other thing is,

1505
01:03:00.664 --> 01:03:02.872
sometimes at that stage,

1506
01:03:02.872 --> 01:03:04.759
despite somebody being that ill,

1507
01:03:04.759 --> 01:03:07.565
you can even then, turn it around.

1508
01:03:09.066 --> 01:03:11.766
<v Interviewer>Well. I'm so glad we met,</v>

1509
01:03:11.766 --> 01:03:14.010
and thank you so much for your time.

1510
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.298
You can purchase a copy of Bird Flu: Are You Prepared?

1511
01:03:20.298 --> 01:03:21.966
at amazon dot com.

1512
01:03:22.121 --> 01:03:24.583
It has a comprehensive self test in it to determine

1513
01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:26.245
which remedies may be right for you

1514
01:03:26.245 --> 01:03:28.422
to eliminate the effects of flu.

1515
01:03:28.422 --> 01:03:31.226
Meanwhile you might also try finding a practicing homeopath

1516
01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:33.200
in your region, which is not that easy,

1517
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.407
in the United States in particular.

1518
01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:37.889
The first visit is usually very lengthy as they

1519
01:03:37.889 --> 01:03:39.756
get to know you and your body,

1520
01:03:39.756 --> 01:03:41.685
and it's a bit costly but after that,

1521
01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:42.473
very affordable.

1522
01:03:42.473 --> 01:03:45.570
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1523
01:03:45.972 --> 01:03:49.303
(closing music plays)
