00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.770
<v ->One of the many points of hope in these changing times</v>

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.030
are the number of medical doctors who are coming

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.930
to realize that drugs and surgery

4
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.690
do not constitute wellness.

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.070
One such doctor is Jacob Teitelbaum,

6
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.310
author of the book Pain Free 1, 2, 3.

7
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.750
Suffering from fibromyalgia in his days as a medical intern,

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.810
Jacob had to find his own way to becoming pain free

9
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810
when his colleagues couldn't help him.

10
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.190
Today he's an outspoken proponent for turning

11
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.850
to natural substances as a first approach

12
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.560
to living without pain.

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.273
<v ->As I mentioned earlier, it's so hard for people to tell</v>

14
00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:43.713
what's going on, because everybody's trying

15
00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:44.813
to sell them something.

16
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:45.993
There's nothing wrong with money,

17
00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:47.933
you know, the pharmaceutical industry is doing their job.

18
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.293
They're trying to shut out all the other competition

19
00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.373
so they can make a buck, and that's their job.

20
00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:54.852
It's not their job to promote natural health products.

21
00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.953
But my job is to represent the patient.

22
00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:58.213
And because of that, I have a promise

23
00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:00.433
that I do not take money from any companies,

24
00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.713
pharmaceutical or natural.

25
00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:04.213
And for the products I make,

26
00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:06.533
100% of the royalties go to charity,

27
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.433
which means if I recommend a product,

28
00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:10.413
I don't make a penny either way.

29
00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:11.873
You know, people go to the health food store,

30
00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:14.053
they can buy one, the other, or the pharmaceutical.

31
00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.153
But again, I represent the patient.

32
00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:17.473
<v Woman>So let's talk about that.</v>

33
00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:20.373
A lot of your patients have pain, pain is your specialty.

34
00:01:20.373 --> 00:01:22.373
Let's talk about what causes pain

35
00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:24.753
and we're going to talk about what makes it go away,

36
00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:27.293
why we have it, and then we'll go into a little bit

37
00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:30.473
of the hammer verses screwdriver approach.

38
00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:31.433
(laughing)

39
00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.793
<v ->Absolutely, because again, I had chronic fibro pain</v>

40
00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.773
with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome

41
00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:38.433
back in 1975.

42
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.013
It actually knocked me out of medical school

43
00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:41.393
for the year and left me homeless.

44
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.033
My wakeup service used to be a police boot in my side.

45
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.553
And the police were very sweet about it,

46
00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:48.133
but it was time to get up (chuckles) and move along.

47
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.433
Because my dad was dead I was supporting myself

48
00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:52.713
and I just rolled through college in 2 and a half years.

49
00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:55.173
And I was saving just enough credits to keep my scholarship

50
00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:56.873
for the third, I was rolling through med school

51
00:01:56.873 --> 00:01:59.453
and a family crisis crashed and burned.

52
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.493
So I know what it's like to have it.

53
00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:03.533
But I've also spent the last 26 years

54
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.093
treating chronic pain, and what we've learned

55
00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:07.813
is pain is not the enemy.

56
00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:09.713
If you have a hand on the stove,

57
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.433
you don't want to wait to smell burning flesh

58
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.473
to know that you got to move it.

59
00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:15.193
It lets you know early that you need

60
00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:16.653
to pay attention to something.

61
00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:18.653
In that case, get their hand off the stove.

62
00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:20.453
It's like the oil light on your dashboard.

63
00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:22.973
It says something desperately needs attention.

64
00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:25.713
Now if you go to the doctor and say that the oil lights

65
00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.793
on the dashboard, he'll say, "That's pretty annoying,"

66
00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:29.333
put a Band Aid over the oil light, and say,

67
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.093
"Is that better?"
(woman laughs)

68
00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:32.873
And then you wonder why people burn out their bodies

69
00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:34.833
and burn out their motors in that case.

70
00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.293
I call pain the SHIN light.

71
00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:40.453
It tells you, usually, that there's an issue with sleep,

72
00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.673
hormonal problems, infections, inflammation,

73
00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:47.213
impingement, or nutritional deficiencies.

74
00:02:47.213 --> 00:02:49.353
Now those are the four key metabolic areas.

75
00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:51.793
Now certainly, if you have a broken arm or something

76
00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.473
that's pretty obvious, but the things that you can't

77
00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:57.193
really tell, it's usually one of those four SHIN areas.

78
00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.333
And in fact, a double-blind placebo-controlled study

79
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.433
done on people with widespread pain and fibromyalgia

80
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.293
showed that by the end of three months of treating SHIN,

81
00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:09.493
at the end of 99 days, the majority of people were pain-free

82
00:03:09.493 --> 00:03:12.313
and no longer even qualified as having fibromyalgia.

83
00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:14.651
So when you treat the cause of pain,

84
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.111
you put oil in your car, the oil light goes out.

85
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.791
You treat SHIN, the pain light goes out

86
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:21.231
and people feel better.

87
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:23.841
So better to treat the underlying causes of pain.

88
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:26.431
<v Woman>So pain is our indicator,</v>

89
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:28.290
and just as a tiny aside,

90
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.470
what is it about the American public

91
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.571
that feels as though we deserve a pain-free life

92
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:36.011
no matter what we do to our bodies?

93
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.251
Isn't that somewhat a sense of entitlement,

94
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.931
or certainly delusional?

95
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:42.311
<v ->Well, I think it's an appropriate sense of entitlement.</v>

96
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.091
We deserve to be pain-free.

97
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.571
There's no assured punishment or anything like that,

98
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.131
or even right or wrong here.

99
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.011
It's a matter of what works and what doesn't work.

100
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:51.931
So if something doesn't work,

101
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.751
it's not like you're supposed to suffer.

102
00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:56.231
It's your body's way of saying, "Help."

103
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.151
So the bottom line is you're entitled to be pain-free,

104
00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:01.931
and in treating over 3000 people with chronic pain

105
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.691
in the last 26 years, it's a tiny, tiny, tiny,

106
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.931
tiny fraction of people that we can't get

107
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.051
good, solid pain relief.

108
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:10.731
And you know, I think it's never acceptable

109
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:12.171
to leave somebody in pain.

110
00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:13.691
I don't think it's a healthy thing.

111
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.871
<v Woman>I agreewith you, but if you're not taking care</v>

112
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.931
of yourself, if you treat your body badly,

113
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.741
and you end up with pain and you think you can

114
00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:21.881
put a Band Aid on it, well, that's delusional.

115
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.851
<v ->Well, see, that's the thing, your body will tell you</v>

116
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:25.581
if you're not giving it enough sleep,

117
00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:27.466
the average night's sleep 100 years ago

118
00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:28.946
was nine hours a night.

119
00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:30.766
We're now down to less than seven.

120
00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:33.346
And if you think about taking a 25% pay cut,

121
00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:35.726
that's what it's like to your body in terms of energy

122
00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.686
when you cut back your sleep that much.

123
00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:39.065
That's when tissue repair goes on,

124
00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:40.366
so you need to get your sleep.

125
00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:41.586
<v Woman>Let's talk about that for just a second,</v>

126
00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:43.746
about sleep specifically and the hours

127
00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:46.106
where your body is repairing during sleep.

128
00:04:46.106 --> 00:04:48.546
<v ->Well, deep sleep, there's three main ways</v>

129
00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:49.946
you can make growth hormones.

130
00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.426
You know, people are taking growth hormone shots

131
00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:55.326
that I don't recommend, and they're paying 15 grand a year.

132
00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:58.118
But you make growth hormone three main ways,

133
00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.995
exercise, deep sleep, and sex.

134
00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:03.355
So I think all three of them are good.

135
00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:05.435
Deep sleep is the easy one,

136
00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:07.415
that's when you make growth hormone release.

137
00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:08.875
So if you don't get enough deep sleep,

138
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.755
that's when tissue repair goes on.

139
00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:14.515
The growth hormone also leaves you skinny and young.

140
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:16.315
It's called the Fountain of Youth hormone.

141
00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:17.735
<v Woman>And does that happen during a certain</v>

142
00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:20.515
type of sleep pattern or a certain time of the night?

143
00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.775
<v ->It happens at stage three, four sleep.</v>

144
00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:24.615
That's why most sleeping pills are a problem.

145
00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:28.155
The benzodiazepine, Valium probably, kind of things,

146
00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:29.995
because they keep you in light sleep,

147
00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.455
so you're unconscious,

148
00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:33.503
but you don't recharge your batteries.

149
00:05:33.503 --> 00:05:35.483
And that's why things that restore deep sleep,

150
00:05:35.483 --> 00:05:38.503
suntheanine, theanine which comes from green tea,

151
00:05:38.503 --> 00:05:41.523
is an excellent natural product that's been shown

152
00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:43.303
to keep you in deep sleep.

153
00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:45.383
It will not leave you stupid the next day

154
00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:47.043
'cause it's not gonna sedate you,

155
00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:49.543
but it simply calms you and keeps you in deep sleep.

156
00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:52.523
So there's natural ways that people can get excellent

157
00:05:52.523 --> 00:05:55.603
sleep support, wild lettuce, Jamaican dogwood, hops,

158
00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:57.263
you know, drink a beer.
(laughs)

159
00:05:57.263 --> 00:05:58.603
<v Woman>We're gonna drink a beer, okay,</v>

160
00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:00.263
so that's the sleep element of how we begin

161
00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:02.283
the healing process in our bodies, right?

162
00:06:02.283 --> 00:06:04.663
And now let's talk about the other areas

163
00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:06.243
that you mentioned earlier.

164
00:06:06.243 --> 00:06:07.823
<v ->Well nutrition is the foundation</v>

165
00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:09.883
of energy production and health.

166
00:06:09.883 --> 00:06:12.743
Your body is remarkable at making the best

167
00:06:12.743 --> 00:06:15.523
of the tools it has so you can achieve balance,

168
00:06:15.523 --> 00:06:17.783
but if it doesn't have the basic building blocks,

169
00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:19.183
you're out of luck.

170
00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:22.463
So the American diet gets an average of almost 140 pounds

171
00:06:22.463 --> 00:06:24.923
of sugar per person per year added in to it.

172
00:06:24.923 --> 00:06:28.083
Another 18% of calories from white flour.

173
00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.442
That's a third of your calories that are almost devoid

174
00:06:30.442 --> 00:06:31.703
of vitamins and minerals.

175
00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:33.737
<v Woman>And they create inflammation as well, don't they?</v>

176
00:06:33.737 --> 00:06:36.657
<v ->And many of things aggravate, if you don't have enough</v>

177
00:06:36.657 --> 00:06:39.752
fish oil or omega-3's, and we used to get 12 times as many

178
00:06:39.752 --> 00:06:43.311
omega-3's as omega-6's, now we're down to one to one,

179
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.331
and those are very inflammatory.

180
00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:48.631
So diet clearly plays a role in inflammation.

181
00:06:48.631 --> 00:06:52.451
Also in fatigue, in pain, in degenerative diseases,

182
00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:54.571
and how you feel and move.

183
00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:57.491
So just with sugar and white flour you've lost a third

184
00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:00.491
of your nutrients, and the body, the diet only has

185
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:01.851
about a 10% leeway--

186
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.111
<v Woman>So we lost a quarter of our sleep,</v>

187
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:04.471
we've lost a third of our nutrients,

188
00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:07.331
and in fact have put nutrients in which are causing harm.

189
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:08.651
<v ->Yes.
<v Woman>Not just devoid,</v>

190
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.092
but causing harm.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

191
00:07:10.092 --> 00:07:12.752
It used to be goiter was epidemic because of low iodine,

192
00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:16.412
we put iodine in wheat and salt, and that took care of it.

193
00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:18.972
Now they're putting bromides into the wheat,

194
00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.933
which actually antagonizes iodine,

195
00:07:20.933 --> 00:07:22.232
it's worse than nothing.

196
00:07:22.232 --> 00:07:24.412
And we're seeing another epidemic, I think,

197
00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:26.672
of iodine deficiency coming again,

198
00:07:26.672 --> 00:07:29.253
manifesting not only as goiter or thyroid problems,

199
00:07:29.253 --> 00:07:30.792
but as breast cancer.

200
00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:33.832
Because half of the iodine function is in the thyroid

201
00:07:33.832 --> 00:07:35.872
roughly and the other half in breast tissue.

202
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.832
So if you see people with fibrocystic breast disease,

203
00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:40.052
think low iodine.

204
00:07:40.052 --> 00:07:42.738
The average Japanese woman eating a seaweed diet

205
00:07:42.738 --> 00:07:45.858
gets 12,500 micrograms of iodine a day.

206
00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:48.378
Americans are lucky to get 150.

207
00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:50.738
<v Woman>Interesting.</v>
<v ->That's just one example,</v>

208
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:52.918
and that's one of hundreds of examples.

209
00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.778
So the question is, "What vitamin tablet should I take?"

210
00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:59.680
It's not good for people to take handfuls of stuff each day.

211
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.899
A very simple way to get outstanding support

212
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.360
is with a vitamin powder, my favorite is called

213
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.540
the Energy Revitalization System, one drink and one capsule

214
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.080
replaces 35 tablets of supplements a day,

215
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.960
and it's excellent for almost everybody in the country.

216
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.180
We give them solid nutritional support.

217
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.680
Another study we just finished was on ribose

218
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.660
at our research center, and that's a sugar,

219
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.220
but it's a healthy sugar made by the body.

220
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.640
If you think of deoxyribonucleic acid,

221
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.839
DNA, RNA, it helps the energy formation,

222
00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.220
ATP, NADH, these things all made of ribose.

223
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.880
And not having enough ribose is one of the reasons

224
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.890
for deficiencies, so giving the ribose in our study

225
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.872
increased energy an average of 44%.

226
00:08:40.872 --> 00:08:43.012
And this was in a population with fibromyalgia

227
00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:44.732
and chronic fatigue syndrome.

228
00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.592
So there's a lot of simple things you can do,

229
00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.332
and pain went way down.

230
00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:50.232
So there's many simple things you can do,

231
00:08:50.232 --> 00:08:52.351
when you give your body nutrition and sleep,

232
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:55.352
that, by itself, is often enough to help the pain

233
00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:57.272
get much better or go away.

234
00:08:57.272 --> 00:08:58.552
<v Woman>What about alkalinity,</v>

235
00:08:58.552 --> 00:09:00.572
this is a new subject and it's a big one right now.

236
00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:01.692
<v ->Nope, it's an old subject.</v>

237
00:09:01.692 --> 00:09:04.152
<v Woman>Well I mean, it's getting a big buzz right now.</v>

238
00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:05.812
<v ->Yeah, I've been in practice for 30 years,</v>

239
00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:07.592
I see the fashion trends come and go.

240
00:09:07.592 --> 00:09:10.112
This is simply one of the many curves.

241
00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:12.432
The problem with acid-base balance is

242
00:09:12.432 --> 00:09:15.392
that we don't have a good test to determine

243
00:09:15.392 --> 00:09:17.912
whether somebody is true alkaline or true basic.

244
00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:20.052
What most doctors will do is they'll just check

245
00:09:20.052 --> 00:09:21.912
what's called the blood gas, and everybody's going

246
00:09:21.912 --> 00:09:23.292
to be seven point four.

247
00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.692
But they forget the effect of stressing the buffer systems

248
00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:27.712
on the body for the pH.

249
00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:30.372
So basically, they say, "Well everybody's at a set pH,"

250
00:09:30.372 --> 00:09:31.912
but they don't realize that you have to throw off

251
00:09:31.912 --> 00:09:35.072
the breathing, or your metabolism to get that

252
00:09:35.072 --> 00:09:36.652
and the effects of that.

253
00:09:36.652 --> 00:09:37.852
So many people will go ahead and say,

254
00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:40.412
"Okay, well let's do saliva pH and urine pH--"

255
00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:42.012
<v Woman>Right, are those worth anything?</v>

256
00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:43.292
<v ->They're worth something, but I don't think</v>

257
00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:44.571
they're that reliable.

258
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:47.953
A much better way to tell is to have a highly alkaline diet

259
00:09:47.953 --> 00:09:49.933
for two, three weeks, and then have a high

260
00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:51.992
meat acidic diet for two, three weeks,

261
00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:54.052
and see which way feels better.

262
00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.012
One of the most important messages that people

263
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:59.252
can get is that your body tells you what it wants

264
00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:01.052
by what feels good to you.

265
00:10:01.052 --> 00:10:02.972
And now, you have to check not just right after

266
00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:04.632
you take something, if you shoot up heroine

267
00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:05.932
you're gonna feel better,

268
00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:07.512
but the next day you're gonna feel like hell.

269
00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:08.972
<v Woman>Well let's just say we're talking about</v>

270
00:10:08.972 --> 00:10:11.672
natural products you can consume.

271
00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:13.572
<v ->Basically medications, natural things,</v>

272
00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:16.372
if it helps you feel better, it's probably good for you.

273
00:10:16.372 --> 00:10:19.272
<v Woman>Well you have high sustained levels of energy,</v>

274
00:10:19.272 --> 00:10:21.412
your metabolic rate is good--
<v ->And you feel good.</v>

275
00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.535
<v Woman>You feel good.</v>
<v ->You feel good.</v>

276
00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:23.595
<v Woman>Right, right.</v>
<v ->It's kind of like,</v>

277
00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:25.375
people say, "Well what's the best size shoe

278
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.295
"for everybody to wear?"

279
00:10:27.295 --> 00:10:29.155
Well I have a variability.
<v Woman>Whatever feels good.</v>

280
00:10:29.155 --> 00:10:31.695
<v ->So you try it on, if it's too small, you do a bigger one,</v>

281
00:10:31.695 --> 00:10:34.235
if it's too big, you do a smaller one, now it's just right.

282
00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:37.295
You know what fits, you know what's good, there you are.

283
00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:39.215
And the same with nutrients, I talk about the energy

284
00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.815
revitalization system, it says a scoop a day,

285
00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:43.575
but I do two thirds of a scoop a day,

286
00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:45.015
half a scoop is plenty.

287
00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:47.435
You take these things to the level that feels the best

288
00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:50.035
to you, and that's how you know it's good for you.

289
00:10:50.035 --> 00:10:51.955
<v Woman>So let's talk about some specific ailments</v>

290
00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:53.895
where people would end up running to their doctor

291
00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:56.115
and maybe getting clubbed over the head with a hammer

292
00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:57.655
with something that's overkill.

293
00:10:57.655 --> 00:10:59.135
Let's start with migraines.

294
00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:01.775
<v ->Oh migraines, it's really sad.</v>

295
00:11:01.775 --> 00:11:04.255
When I was on CNN a little while ago,

296
00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:08.675
waiting to go on, they had this section about using surgery,

297
00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:10.892
cutting out big face muscles to go ahead

298
00:11:10.892 --> 00:11:13.372
and decrease migraines by 50%.

299
00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:16.352
And I wanted to tell them, just 400 milligrams

300
00:11:16.352 --> 00:11:19.632
of vitamin B2, riboflavin, decreases migraines

301
00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:22.152
by 67% in repeat studies.

302
00:11:22.152 --> 00:11:25.652
Magnesium, B12, you do those three together

303
00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.912
and you're gonna cut your migraines back 75% to 90%.

304
00:11:28.912 --> 00:11:31.892
You take food allergies, using NADT or other energy

305
00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:35.852
type things, decrease migraines 80% to 90%.

306
00:11:35.852 --> 00:11:38.272
Migraines are easy to prevent

307
00:11:38.272 --> 00:11:39.732
when you treat the underlying problems.

308
00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.833
<v Woman>What is usually the underlying problem?</v>

309
00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:43.548
Is it a deficiency of those nutrients, or?

310
00:11:43.548 --> 00:11:46.068
<v ->It's a deficiency of energy production,</v>

311
00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:48.749
so you get spasm and dilation of the blood vessels.

312
00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:50.715
It's triggered by muscle spasm.

313
00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:53.655
People used to think it was only blood vessel dilation

314
00:11:53.655 --> 00:11:56.655
verses tension headaches, which is in the neck muscles

315
00:11:56.655 --> 00:11:59.375
and what's called the sternocleidomastoid

316
00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.825
causing tension here, but we're realizing

317
00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:05.951
that it's really a spectrum where one flows into the other.

318
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.171
So the whole SHIN thing we talked about, sleep,

319
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:10.508
hormone, infection, nutrition, fluctuations

320
00:12:10.508 --> 00:12:13.848
in estrogen levels, drops in energy and serotonin,

321
00:12:13.848 --> 00:12:14.948
there's many things--

322
00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:16.088
<v Woman>What about digestion?</v>

323
00:12:16.088 --> 00:12:17.988
<v ->Well that's gonna cause nutritional deficiencies.</v>

324
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:20.348
And let's talk about indigestion.

325
00:12:20.348 --> 00:12:21.348
<v Woman>Well I was going to say,</v>

326
00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:22.828
the digestive connection to migraines

327
00:12:22.828 --> 00:12:25.108
often times it seems to go together for people.

328
00:12:25.108 --> 00:12:27.108
<v ->If you have poor digestion, you're more prone</v>

329
00:12:27.108 --> 00:12:29.708
to food allergies and nutritional deficiencies.

330
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.968
And if you think about it, acid blockers like, well,

331
00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:34.888
I don't even want to give the names of the medications,

332
00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:38.628
but the acid blockers used to be unnecessary.

333
00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:40.928
And now they want to make believe that you have

334
00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.388
too much stomach acid, but if you look at it,

335
00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:46.688
the older people are, the more they need acid blockers,

336
00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:50.188
and the older people are, the less stomach acid they make.

337
00:12:50.188 --> 00:12:52.429
So it's not a matter of too much acid,

338
00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:54.208
it's a matter of poor digestion.

339
00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:56.148
If you look back several decades ago,

340
00:12:56.148 --> 00:12:58.708
food processors learned that if you destroy

341
00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:02.068
the enzymes in food, the enzymes are what ripen the food,

342
00:13:02.068 --> 00:13:04.288
it'll have a very long shelf life.

343
00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:07.148
If you have an ear of corn, shelf life five days,

344
00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:09.928
corn flakes, shelf life five millennia.

345
00:13:09.928 --> 00:13:12.768
So the problem is that food will look good,

346
00:13:12.768 --> 00:13:14.508
but those same enzymes in the food

347
00:13:14.508 --> 00:13:17.428
that ripen the food digest the food when you eat it.

348
00:13:17.428 --> 00:13:20.368
So the food looks good, but becomes indigestible,

349
00:13:20.368 --> 00:13:23.788
you get indigestion, any stomach acid hurts,

350
00:13:23.788 --> 00:13:26.568
and you find yourself on acid blockers.

351
00:13:26.568 --> 00:13:27.648
But think about it.

352
00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:29.350
If you have poor digestion, and now you're turning

353
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.163
off your stomach acid, that makes your digestion even worse.

354
00:13:33.163 --> 00:13:35.064
No symptoms, but you're not getting the nutrients

355
00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.965
out of the food, and you're more prone to food allergies.

356
00:13:37.965 --> 00:13:40.185
So a better thing would be if you used plant-based

357
00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:42.745
digestive enzymes, animal-based ones don't work

358
00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:44.685
because they don't work in the acidic environment

359
00:13:44.685 --> 00:13:45.905
of the stomach.

360
00:13:45.905 --> 00:13:48.545
But use plant-based enzymes, don't take iced liquids

361
00:13:48.545 --> 00:13:51.645
with your meals, enzymes don't work at cold temperatures.

362
00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:55.226
Between meals is fine, or, if you feel great,

363
00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:56.265
don't worry about it.

364
00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:58.305
But if you're sitting there popping acid blockers,

365
00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.385
use warm liquids with your meals to increase

366
00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:01.965
the activity of the enzymes.

367
00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:04.124
<v Woman>Considering the nature of our Western diet</v>

368
00:14:04.124 --> 00:14:06.585
in particular, would you say that most people over a given

369
00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:10.025
age such as 40 or 50 actually need additional enzymes?

370
00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:11.846
<v ->I think most people would benefit from it,</v>

371
00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:14.605
in fact that would tease some people in the food industry

372
00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:16.785
to set up packaging that actually,

373
00:14:16.785 --> 00:14:18.025
when you open the packaging,

374
00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.125
releases the enzymes back into the food.

375
00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:24.185
So you have an indigestion-free food line.

376
00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:26.025
<v Woman>Next best thing to having the food</v>

377
00:14:26.025 --> 00:14:28.425
growing in the sunshine and from healthy dirt.

378
00:14:28.425 --> 00:14:31.765
<v ->Indeed, well we have to feed 257 million people plus,</v>

379
00:14:31.765 --> 00:14:34.305
and I give the food processors credit.

380
00:14:34.305 --> 00:14:37.925
At Woodstock they talked about breakfast for 250,000,

381
00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:40.226
they're doing 250 million every day.

382
00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:41.585
They've got to do what they've got to do,

383
00:14:41.585 --> 00:14:42.965
I'm not faulting them.

384
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.745
Certainly eating a whole food diet's gonna be

385
00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:46.885
a healthier way to go, but not everybody can do that.

386
00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.625
So the next best thing is, how do you make it easy?

387
00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:53.645
<v Woman>So let's talk, okay, we talked about digestion</v>

388
00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:56.465
and migraines, what about inflammation-oriented

389
00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:58.205
diseases such as arthritis?

390
00:14:58.205 --> 00:15:01.965
<v ->Inflammation in general responds very well to fish oil,</v>

391
00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:03.586
'cause we talked about the lack

392
00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:05.925
of omega-3's being inflammatory.

393
00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:08.165
But you want fish oil that's mercury-free.

394
00:15:08.165 --> 00:15:10.545
Eskimo Free, Nordic Naturals,

395
00:15:10.545 --> 00:15:12.465
these are some very good brands.

396
00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:14.864
In pregnancy, the most important deficiency is fish oil,

397
00:15:14.864 --> 00:15:16.885
that's why people get postpartum depression.

398
00:15:16.885 --> 00:15:19.745
But in inflammation you do that, but also,

399
00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:23.005
if you look at herbals, willow bark, for example,

400
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.965
in head-on studies with Motrin have found their medications

401
00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:27.665
were twice as effective.

402
00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:30.805
And there are multiple studies showing the willow bark,

403
00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.345
but the dosing is important, you wanna get the right dose.

404
00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:38.005
Boswellia, or frankincense, 900 to 1000 milligrams a day,

405
00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:41.559
very good anti-inflammatory, even helps colitis and asthma.

406
00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:45.959
In one study decreased arthritis pain by over 80%

407
00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:47.739
after eight weeks.

408
00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:50.299
So you have natural things that are incredibly effective.

409
00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.839
Glucosamine is very good for healing the joints

410
00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:55.199
as would be MSM and chondroiten.

411
00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:58.959
It was interesting, they recently had a study

412
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:02.799
that the NIH set up, and it's a funny thing,

413
00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:04.481
because you have somebody who is in charge

414
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:06.921
of the complimentary medicine division,

415
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:11.301
who brags that he has absolutely no experience

416
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:13.491
with any natural remedies at all.

417
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:16.871
And study after study was set up with design flaws

418
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:19.111
that any first-year herbal student could have looked at

419
00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:22.011
and said, "This study is designed to fail."

420
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:26.071
And then the study fails, and the funny thing is,

421
00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:28.111
when they put the medicines in those same study,

422
00:16:28.111 --> 00:16:29.971
even the medicines don't work.

423
00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:32.491
So you look at the recent glucosamine study,

424
00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.531
and for mild to moderate arthritis the Celebrex

425
00:16:35.531 --> 00:16:38.951
was no more effective, statistically and clinically,

426
00:16:38.951 --> 00:16:41.191
than the placebo.

427
00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:44.951
The herbal, basically glucosamine chondroitin,

428
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:47.651
much more effective than the placebo.

429
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:51.732
And overall for the mild arthritis, 66 1/2% of people

430
00:16:51.732 --> 00:16:55.832
improved with a natural, 70% with the medication,

431
00:16:55.832 --> 00:16:59.051
but the overall pain reduction was more for the herbal.

432
00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:01.711
So the herbal remedies, or I should say, glucosamine,

433
00:17:01.711 --> 00:17:03.431
not quite an herbal, but natural remedies,

434
00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:06.905
were much more effective overall than the Celebrex.

435
00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:09.545
But the conclusion of the study and what the newspapers

436
00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:11.905
picked up were, don't use the natural remedies,

437
00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:13.885
they don't work, use Celebrex.

438
00:17:13.885 --> 00:17:16.425
Now this boggles the mind until you realize

439
00:17:16.425 --> 00:17:20.785
that 11 of the authors on the study were on the payroll

440
00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:24.545
of drug companies that make pain medications.

441
00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:27.485
And you look at the Motrin family of medications,

442
00:17:27.485 --> 00:17:31.105
that's a three billion dollar a year industry,

443
00:17:31.105 --> 00:17:33.205
of course we pay four billion dollars a year

444
00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:34.785
to treat the hospitalizations caused

445
00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:37.785
by side effects of the medication, Vioxx, Celebrex,

446
00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:41.425
billions of dollars more, and over 100,000 heart attacks

447
00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:44.125
and strokes, and these are devastating things.

448
00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:46.705
So it's one thing for the media, not the media

449
00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:50.105
but for the drug companies' employees

450
00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:53.985
to want to go ahead and protect their benefactors,

451
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:56.705
but not at the cost of over 16,000 deaths

452
00:17:56.705 --> 00:17:59.905
in the United States a year that are totally unnecessary.

453
00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:02.325
<v Woman>And we, I mean, I think our audience</v>

454
00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:05.705
is pretty clear on how research is funded

455
00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:07.445
in the pharmaceutical industry,

456
00:18:07.445 --> 00:18:09.245
we don't even really need to go there.

457
00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:13.245
And so, to basically, we were talking a moment ago

458
00:18:13.245 --> 00:18:15.565
about inflammation, another element to all of this

459
00:18:15.565 --> 00:18:17.688
is don't do the things that would aggravate

460
00:18:17.688 --> 00:18:21.128
these problem, such as a very high acidic diet

461
00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:23.909
in terms of the refined white foods, right,

462
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:25.208
eliminate those--
<v ->I'm gonna go back</v>

463
00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:28.428
to what I said before, there is no one diet for everybody.

464
00:18:28.428 --> 00:18:30.568
There are some people that live on McDonalds

465
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.308
and smoke and drink and they're doing great.

466
00:18:32.308 --> 00:18:34.469
And I'm gonna tell you, if somebody feels great,

467
00:18:34.469 --> 00:18:36.328
leave them alone, it's working.

468
00:18:36.328 --> 00:18:38.668
But if your body feels bad, if you're in pain,

469
00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:41.648
it's telling you you need to make some changes.

470
00:18:41.648 --> 00:18:43.788
And a good place to begin is with a healthy,

471
00:18:43.788 --> 00:18:46.368
whole food diet, but again, some people need

472
00:18:46.368 --> 00:18:49.068
a high meat diet, and some need a high vegetable diet,

473
00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:50.628
it's not one size fits all.

474
00:18:50.628 --> 00:18:53.029
<v Woman>Does anybody need a lot of sugar and white flour?</v>

475
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:55.928
<v ->Yeah, I think some of the food processing companies</v>

476
00:18:55.928 --> 00:18:57.348
do to make the money.
<v Woman>Okay.</v>

477
00:18:57.348 --> 00:18:58.828
I was gonna say, I don't know of any bodies

478
00:18:58.828 --> 00:19:00.228
that actually need that, as much

479
00:19:00.228 --> 00:19:02.128
as we might enjoy a cupcake from time to time.

480
00:19:02.128 --> 00:19:04.308
<v ->Yeah, in others, I don't want to take candy from children</v>

481
00:19:04.308 --> 00:19:07.008
or adults, and I tell people to cut out the sugar,

482
00:19:07.008 --> 00:19:09.688
but I do add the three magic words, "except for chocolate."

483
00:19:09.688 --> 00:19:11.408
<v Woman>Except for chocolate, of course.</v>

484
00:19:11.408 --> 00:19:13.308
<v ->And having said that, there's sugar-free chocolates</v>

485
00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:15.808
like Russell Stover, Godiva has a lot that tastes great,

486
00:19:15.808 --> 00:19:17.368
others taste like cardboard.

487
00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:18.508
So you wanna keep your pleasure--

488
00:19:18.508 --> 00:19:19.709
<v Woman>A lot of really natural ones too.</v>

489
00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:22.148
<v ->but keep it in a way that are healthy, do a taste test.</v>

490
00:19:22.148 --> 00:19:23.868
<v Woman>So when we're in pain,</v>

491
00:19:23.868 --> 00:19:26.888
am I guessing that you would say, "Don't run to your doctor

492
00:19:26.888 --> 00:19:29.749
first to have them fix it," is that a fair thing to say?

493
00:19:29.749 --> 00:19:31.848
<v ->Well, let me tell you what most doctors--</v>

494
00:19:31.848 --> 00:19:33.028
<v Woman>And you are a doctor, I know that.</v>

495
00:19:33.028 --> 00:19:35.128
<v ->I'm a MD, I'm board-certified internist, let me tell you</v>

496
00:19:35.128 --> 00:19:37.789
what most doctors are taught about pain management.

497
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:40.788
They're taught, give Motrin or Vioxx family medications,

498
00:19:40.788 --> 00:19:43.628
or Tylenol, and if they have cancer,

499
00:19:43.628 --> 00:19:45.989
give them narcotics if you need to.

500
00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:46.948
That's it.

501
00:19:46.948 --> 00:19:48.889
If they're surgeons, they're taught to operate.

502
00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:50.928
That's all your doctor has been taught about.

503
00:19:50.928 --> 00:19:54.349
And when you talk about having the whole tool kit

504
00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:57.589
to treat problems, prescriptions are like the hammer.

505
00:19:57.589 --> 00:20:01.028
But all doctors have is that hammer,

506
00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:02.728
prescription and surgery.

507
00:20:02.728 --> 00:20:04.288
And that's the way everybody walks out of their office

508
00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:06.008
feeling like they've been nailed.

509
00:20:06.008 --> 00:20:07.809
And when you have the whole tool kit,

510
00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:10.268
you have the screwdriver and the pliers and the wrenches,

511
00:20:10.268 --> 00:20:12.068
you have all the natural things,

512
00:20:12.068 --> 00:20:13.908
now you can go ahead and heal people.

513
00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:15.348
And I don't want to get rid of the hammer,

514
00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:17.528
there's times, 'cause I do comprehensive medicine,

515
00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:21.568
I'll use prescription, but a lot that are much safer

516
00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:24.568
than the unsafe, like Motrin stuff.

517
00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:27.608
But go with natural things first, they're more effective

518
00:20:27.608 --> 00:20:28.848
and they're safer.

519
00:20:28.848 --> 00:20:31.728
For each kind of problem, disc disease for example.

520
00:20:31.728 --> 00:20:34.228
I almost never had to send somebody for surgery

521
00:20:34.228 --> 00:20:36.328
'cause you take an old herb that's been turned

522
00:20:36.328 --> 00:20:39.728
into a medication called colchicine, it's decades old.

523
00:20:39.728 --> 00:20:42.788
We give six injections, IV once a week for six weeks

524
00:20:42.788 --> 00:20:44.829
along with a nutritional IV.

525
00:20:44.829 --> 00:20:47.108
And in the studies of over 3000 patients,

526
00:20:47.108 --> 00:20:50.928
over 70% of people's disc pain will be gone by six weeks.

527
00:20:50.928 --> 00:20:54.269
When you add the nutritional IV our experience is over 90%.

528
00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:57.348
But there's a big problem with the IV treatment.

529
00:20:57.348 --> 00:21:00.228
The problem is that the entire cost of the six doses

530
00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:04.189
of colchicine is $18, plus the cost of starting the IV.

531
00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:06.808
Surgery is $27,000.

532
00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:09.469
Which one do you think your doctor is gonna learn about?

533
00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:12.248
And then you look at carpal tunnel syndrome.

534
00:21:12.248 --> 00:21:14.208
You don't need surgery.

535
00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:17.748
Most people find vitamin B6, 250 milligrams,

536
00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:20.388
a wrist splint that keeps your hand in a neutral position,

537
00:21:20.388 --> 00:21:22.408
like holding a glass of water,

538
00:21:22.408 --> 00:21:24.388
that kind of neutral position at night,

539
00:21:24.388 --> 00:21:27.828
and often a little bit of prescription natural thyroid.

540
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.749
Almost always gets rid of carpal tunnel syndrome

541
00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.809
unless the person has con-tin-der-en-dro-ped-i-gal

542
00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:34.148
repetitive stress injury.

543
00:21:34.148 --> 00:21:36.208
So you don't need surgery for these things

544
00:21:36.208 --> 00:21:40.049
but if I was a back surgeon and somebody came along

545
00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.468
and said, "Look at these studies of thousands of patients,

546
00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:45.148
"IV colchicine gets them better, isn't that great?"

547
00:21:45.148 --> 00:21:46.948
"What did you say?
"I didn't hear anything."

548
00:21:46.948 --> 00:21:48.728
<v Woman>Excuse me.</v>
<v ->What? (laughing)</v>

549
00:21:48.728 --> 00:21:51.089
<v Woman>I didn't hear that, I can't hear you.</v>

550
00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:52.891
<v ->Exactly they can't hear you.</v>

551
00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:54.451
<v Woman>Yeah, I know they can't, yeah.</v>

552
00:21:54.451 --> 00:21:56.051
<v ->And again, I don't blame them for that.</v>

553
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:58.451
I mean, I remember I used to do heart monitors

554
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:00.831
as an internist, and I thought I was doing great good

555
00:22:00.831 --> 00:22:02.851
on the planet and helping prevent people from dying,

556
00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:05.831
and I was also making 250 bucks a pop

557
00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:07.271
for five minutes' work.

558
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.551
I'd at least have somebody out of dizziness and fluttering,

559
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:10.691
and need a heart monitor.
<v Woman>A lot of motivation</v>

560
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:12.032
there.
<v ->Ca-ching, it was great.</v>

561
00:22:12.032 --> 00:22:14.052
And when the studies came out showing they were largely

562
00:22:14.052 --> 00:22:17.193
a waste of time, I didn't want to look at them either.

563
00:22:17.193 --> 00:22:20.513
So it's not that they're bad people, it's just human nature.

564
00:22:20.513 --> 00:22:22.033
And that's why the consumer needs

565
00:22:22.033 --> 00:22:24.773
to look out for themselves and really do their homework.

566
00:22:24.773 --> 00:22:26.593
<v Woman>Well, thank you so much, and just,</v>

567
00:22:26.593 --> 00:22:28.553
I guess, was it your own pain that really drove you

568
00:22:28.553 --> 00:22:31.373
into starting to understand the underlying causes?

569
00:22:31.373 --> 00:22:33.493
<v ->And my empathy and compassion.</v>

570
00:22:33.493 --> 00:22:36.693
I really, I tend to be fairly empathic.

571
00:22:36.693 --> 00:22:39.893
I've been there, I know what people feel like

572
00:22:39.893 --> 00:22:42.494
when they're having it, and I know that pretty much

573
00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:43.993
everybody can get pain free.

574
00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:46.294
Plus I wrote the book Pain Free, 1-2-3.

575
00:22:46.294 --> 00:22:47.893
<v Woman>One, two, three.</v>
<v ->Came out last month</v>

576
00:22:47.893 --> 00:22:50.933
under McGraw Hill, it will give you literally hundreds

577
00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:53.933
of natural prescription therapies tailored to the type

578
00:22:53.933 --> 00:22:56.433
of pain you have and it'll show you how to figure out

579
00:22:56.433 --> 00:22:58.513
which are the best ones to use in your case.

580
00:22:58.513 --> 00:22:59.873
<v Woman>Wonderful, and we'll have that on the site</v>

581
00:22:59.873 --> 00:23:01.334
so people can get right to it.

582
00:23:01.334 --> 00:23:02.293
<v ->That'll be great.
<v Woman>Thank you so much</v>

583
00:23:02.293 --> 00:23:04.164
for your time.
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

584
00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:07.673
<v ->If you have chosen to be well and stay well,</v>

585
00:23:07.673 --> 00:23:10.733
you'll also enjoy our interview with Dr. Lorraine Day.

586
00:23:10.733 --> 00:23:13.753
Dr. Day reversed her N-stage cancer by turning

587
00:23:13.753 --> 00:23:16.073
to a prescription in the Old Testament

588
00:23:16.073 --> 00:23:18.373
for eliminating disease from our lives.

589
00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:20.373
Until next time, thanks for watching.
