(pulsing music)

2
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:08.827
<v ->Many of us have spent years and great amounts of money</v>

3
00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:11.232
trying to improve our health over our lifetimes.

4
00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:14.299
We've considered food, supplements, exercise,

5
00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.720
meditation, energetic technologies and more,

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.072
but what few have given serious consideration to,

7
00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:21.473
is electricity.

8
00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:24.575
We're electrical beings, most of whom live in an environment

9
00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.545
of dirty electricity.

10
00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.709
Donna Fisher, author of

11
00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:30.485
"Dirty Electricity and Electromagnetic Radiation,"

12
00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.319
details how dirty electricity has been surrounding us

13
00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:36.220
for decades, and how it's been impacting our health,

14
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.525
especially where cancer is concerned.

15
00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:40.998
Later in the conversation, we speak with Dave Stetzer

16
00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:43.678
about the technology end of this story.

17
00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:48.433
Donna this is a really, a really important topic.

18
00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.936
I know that, and, in fact, you'd be proud,

19
00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.304
I reported on it about 20 years ago,

20
00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.742
when I was an investigative reporter,

21
00:00:55.742 --> 00:00:58.175
on the subject of dirty electricity

22
00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:01.813
and electromagnetic fields, and they were just beginning to,

23
00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:04.083
reports were coming in on the impact on health,

24
00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:07.618
but so much more is known now, and so much more is possible

25
00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:10.689
to really cure this situation as it were,

26
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.192
so this is a perfect timing for this conversation,

27
00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:16.160
and in the work you do, one of the things I read

28
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.663
at the very beginning of your book,

29
00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:21.233
was the work of Samuel Milham,
Dr. Samuel Milham.

30
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.669
Could you go ahead and just launch in

31
00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.085
and tell us about that?

32
00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:26.070
<v ->Okay, Dr. Sam Milham,</v>

33
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.074
he was with the Washington State Department of Health.

34
00:01:29.074 --> 00:01:31.477
He was the Chief Epidemiologist there,

35
00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:34.279
and he has looked into over a hundred cancer clusters,

36
00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.981
and he has had 50 years of research,

37
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.085
and he is very qualified to actually say

38
00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:43.488
that dirty electricity is the underlying menace.

39
00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:46.774
It is a potent universal carcinogen.

40
00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:48.327
<v Regina>And you looked into patterns</v>

41
00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:49.727
from the time energy,

42
00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:52.000
the electrical grid was being developed,

43
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.933
in the electrification of America, right?

44
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.335
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>In terms of decade by decade</v>

45
00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.804
the increases in rates, I read one stat there

46
00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:04.008
that was something like a 58.8% rise in cancers

47
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.678
in an area that was urban, after electrification --

48
00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:08.313
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Versus the world counterparts?</v>

49
00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:09.481
<v ->Yes, that's correct.</v>

50
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:12.083
He looked at when the 48 states of America

51
00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.518
were actually electrified.

52
00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:15.654
He then compared the people in the city

53
00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:17.190
who had electricity and the people

54
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.290
in the country who didn't,

55
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.392
and he said the people in the city

56
00:02:20.392 --> 00:02:24.830
had a 58.8% higher risk of cancer

57
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.533
and he said the statistics have been there all along,

58
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.234
but nobody's been looking,

59
00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:32.172
that dirty electricity has existed

60
00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:35.640
from the very first generation of electricity, itself,

61
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.378
and it has slowly weaved its way,

62
00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:42.482
so slowly that the so-called diseases of civilization,

63
00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:45.417
which they wondered where they came from,

64
00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:48.387
it actually was because that dirty electricity

65
00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:50.754
slowly weaved its way and it presented

66
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.992
with these new plagues as one can say,

67
00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:58.380
cardiovascular disease, cancer, suicide and diabetes.

68
00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:00.865
<v Regina>And heart disease, right?</v>

69
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:04.502
<v ->Yes, because the heart is an electrical organ.</v>

70
00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Regina>Okay, two things, you just said cancer clusters,</v>

71
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.709
please explain what a cancer cluster is

72
00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.780
and secondly, let's talk about what happens

73
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.616
to the body when it's exposed to dirty electricity.

74
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:20.886
On our own, because we have our own

75
00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:22.486
natural electric patterns.

76
00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:24.790
First of all, what are cancer clusters?

77
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.593
<v ->A cancer cluster is, there is more people</v>

78
00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:30.694
than who should have cancer

79
00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.964
in that group of people.

80
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:34.232
That's what a cancer cluster is.

81
00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:37.403
<v Regina>So it's above statistical averages.</v>
<v ->Yes, yes, yes, exactly.</v>

82
00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:39.505
<v ->And give us some idea of</v>

83
00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:43.374
where some of the cancer clusters are located,

84
00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:46.913
what the phenomena, in terms of electromagnetic fields

85
00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:50.915
in that area might be that would cause cancer clusters,

86
00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:52.884
some of the more infamous ones.

87
00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:55.353
<v ->Okay, I started my first book with about,</v>

88
00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:57.756
we had a breast cancer cluster in a workplace

89
00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:00.758
at a TV studio, in Brisbane, 18 women

90
00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:04.597
in one small workplace, developed breast cancer.

91
00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:06.198
Immediately, you would suspect

92
00:04:06.198 --> 00:04:08.433
a dirty electrical environment.

93
00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:11.306
That was not investigated fully enough,

94
00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:13.673
which they admitted, so then I wrote my first book.

95
00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:16.307
We were told in Australia, in 2008,

96
00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:20.512
that America, had 108 breast cancer clusters.

97
00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:22.855
Since then, there's been another breast cancer cluster

98
00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:25.984
at the University in San Diego.

99
00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:29.186
What's really stood out is breast cancer clusters,

100
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:31.523
lung cancer clusters, leukemia clusters,

101
00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:34.459
and brain tumor clusters, and they are everywhere.

102
00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.494
There are lots in workplaces and schools

103
00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:38.863
because they have a lot of electrical equipment in there,

104
00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:41.734
fluorescent lights, and computers,

105
00:04:41.734 --> 00:04:44.069
but they are everywhere,

106
00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.606
and it's very, very sad, because they

107
00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:49.341
have to be investigated.

108
00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:51.276
The research is in.

109
00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:54.413
The research is valid, so that's the cancer clusters.

110
00:04:54.413 --> 00:04:56.948
What dirty electricity is doing to the body,

111
00:04:56.948 --> 00:05:01.619
it's actually the electrons, are actually moving around.

112
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:04.222
It's causing the electrons to move around

113
00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:07.393
and speed up at the rate of the dirty electricity.

114
00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.661
So what that does, it stops the,

115
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:12.697
the cell's signalling system, and it's damaging

116
00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:15.171
our precious DNA, because our body

117
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:18.737
runs on direct current, the brain generates it,

118
00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:23.111
the body works on it, and our signals are natural,

119
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.612
electromagnetic signals.

120
00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:27.913
We're introduce AC current,

121
00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:30.114
but we've got this dirty electricity as well.

122
00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:33.640
It's also speeding up cancer cells

123
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.640
to grow at a rate of 1600% and make them more malignant

124
00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:43.497
and that is why, that is a very alarming conclusion,

125
00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:46.564
and that is why we need to remove dirty electricity

126
00:05:46.564 --> 00:05:49.067
from our homes and from our workplaces.

127
00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:52.304
The Russians say dirty electricity is shutting down

128
00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:55.106
the immune system, but Milham says

129
00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:58.108
it initially stimulates it, and then it fatigues it,

130
00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.911
so it will not work.

131
00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:03.781
The electrical property, is the most important property.

132
00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:06.450
Our bodies run on electric chemical signals.

133
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.321
The electrical property is the most important.

134
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.989
It comes first.

135
00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.691
<v Regina>And our heart and our brains</v>

136
00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:15.259
are most directly --

137
00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:15.993
<v ->Yes.</v>

138
00:06:15.993 --> 00:06:17.628
<v Regina>Impacted by the disturbance</v>

139
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:19.030
of the electrical fields.

140
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.265
<v ->Yes, that is so correct.</v>

141
00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:23.567
So if you're in a dirty electrical field,

142
00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:26.071
it stimulates the heart,

143
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:28.306
people having heart palpitations.

144
00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:31.020
<v Regina>You know it's interesting.</v>

145
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.443
I will get back to this other question,

146
00:06:32.443 --> 00:06:33.711
I was going to ask, in a minute,

147
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:37.849
but I hadn't really, I knew intuitively what was going on,

148
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.684
but quite a few years ago, about 25 years ago,

149
00:06:40.684 --> 00:06:43.688
when I was in the mainstream media,

150
00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:46.824
as a news anchor, I became very ill

151
00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:48.860
during the years I was doing that job,

152
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.863
and I couldn't, it wasn't anything specific,

153
00:06:50.863 --> 00:06:52.296
except I lost all my energy,

154
00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:55.166
to the point where I could barely get up in the morning

155
00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:56.701
and blow my hair dry.

156
00:06:56.701 --> 00:06:59.438
My body was so weak, I had fainted in public,

157
00:06:59.438 --> 00:07:02.373
and they had to call, you know, EMTs in

158
00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:05.211
to pick me up and take me somewhere and I'd wake up,

159
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.345
and I always thought it had something to do

160
00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:09.447
with this massive microwave dish

161
00:07:09.447 --> 00:07:12.451
sitting right above my head, on the television studio,

162
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:14.959
but also, that kind of facility,

163
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:19.023
cause you mentioned the ABC facility in Australia,

164
00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:22.494
everyone there, there was this just,

165
00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:24.329
a lack of vitality and energy

166
00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:26.230
in people working in this space.
<v ->Yes.</v>

167
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.070
<v ->Yes.</v>

168
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.067
<v Regina>And it didn't occur to me,</v>

169
00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:30.326
that it might have been that electrical field.

170
00:07:30.326 --> 00:07:32.170
I just assumed it was only a microwave dish,

171
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.871
but it could have been all of the above together.

172
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:37.376
But it was profoundly, I mean, unhealthy.
<v ->Yes.</v>

173
00:07:37.376 --> 00:07:40.378
<v ->It is unhealthy because the Russians have known about</v>

174
00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:42.781
radio-wave sickness since the 1960s

175
00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:44.782
when their radar workers go sick.

176
00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:47.351
So, when you were under that dish

177
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:50.955
you were getting radio frequency radiation

178
00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:53.090
and microwave radiation.
<v Regina>Both</v>

179
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.794
Today, it's called electro-hypersensitivity.

180
00:07:55.794 --> 00:07:58.730
So you will start to hear, and countries are already

181
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.134
addressing it, as in Sweden, it's actually recognized

182
00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:03.476
as a functional impairment.

183
00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:06.036
People are paid a pension, because they can't work,

184
00:08:06.036 --> 00:08:09.013
so you will hear radio-wave sickness,

185
00:08:09.013 --> 00:08:13.444
electro-hypersensitivity, exposure to dirty electricity,

186
00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:15.547
it's all the same thing.

187
00:08:15.547 --> 00:08:18.516
It can be from headaches, ringing in the ears,

188
00:08:18.516 --> 00:08:22.586
cataracts in the eye, bleeding to psychosis.

189
00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.555
People have mild symptoms,

190
00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:27.124
they can have very debilitating symptoms,

191
00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:29.228
but there are more and more people experiencing it,

192
00:08:29.228 --> 00:08:32.647
because there's so much e-smog, e-pollution.

193
00:08:33.364 --> 00:08:35.934
<v Regina>And one of the types of cancer</v>

194
00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:38.002
that seems to be particularly vulnerable,

195
00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:40.438
as you brought up before, is breast cancer.

196
00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:41.643
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Why is that?</v>

197
00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:43.142
<v Regina>Because this is important with it,</v>

198
00:08:43.142 --> 00:08:45.944
the pink ribbons, all over the place.

199
00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:49.080
<v ->Yes, well breast cancer is the most sensitive tissue</v>

200
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.418
in the body, and it is the most sensitive tissue

201
00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:53.484
to artificial radiation.

202
00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:55.419
When the bombs were actually dropped

203
00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:59.658
on Japan, there was ionizing radiation from the bomb,

204
00:08:59.658 --> 00:09:03.461
so ionizing radiation is the radiation from a bomb,

205
00:09:03.461 --> 00:09:07.098
nuclear weapons, an x-ray, a mammogram, a CAT scan.

206
00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:09.971
It is known, they have known for decades that,

207
00:09:09.971 --> 00:09:11.703
that can kill and it can harm.

208
00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:14.205
It damages DNA, stops the signalling

209
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.940
and it is cumulative.

210
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.076
What I talk about, dirty electricity and wireless,

211
00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:21.145
that's non-ionizing radiation.

212
00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:23.047
They always thought that was safe,

213
00:09:23.047 --> 00:09:25.951
but now we are seeing the same effects

214
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:29.120
and the same illnesses.

215
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.623
So all of the artificial radiation,

216
00:09:31.623 --> 00:09:35.227
that we have produced is not good for us at all,

217
00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:36.997
when it is uncontrolled.

218
00:09:36.997 --> 00:09:38.346
Even when it is controlled.

219
00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:43.868
<v Regina>So really, we were exacerbating</v>

220
00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:45.103
the problem as well.

221
00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:47.205
We have talked to Dr. Nick Begich quite a bit.

222
00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:48.215
<v ->Yes.</v>

223
00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:49.240
<v Regina>About radio frequencies</v>

224
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.876
and cellphone technologies and wireless technologies.

225
00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:53.344
This is only exacerbating

226
00:09:53.344 --> 00:09:55.179
an already very difficult situation.

227
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:58.716
<v ->Yes, it's just putting on another layer, another layer.</v>

228
00:09:58.716 --> 00:10:01.652
There's dirty electricity has it's own frequency.

229
00:10:01.652 --> 00:10:05.156
There's magnetic field and then the wireless,

230
00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:08.158
especially wireless baby monitors,

231
00:10:08.158 --> 00:10:10.027
cordless phones, they are operating

232
00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:11.862
at a higher frequency, again.

233
00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:15.199
The dirty electricity frequency, they know,

234
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:16.934
that harms the body,

235
00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:19.071
because there's a certain frequency window,

236
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:22.239
where the body can be manipulated.

237
00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:24.375
<v Regina>Like my situation in the newsroom,</v>

238
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.911
by the way, after I left that job, never to return,

239
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:29.747
because I hated it anyway, I started recovering.

240
00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:30.381
<v ->Yes!</v>

241
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:33.619
<v Regina>And so I mean, that was an important note.</v>

242
00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:35.453
Now you had a very similar experience

243
00:10:35.453 --> 00:10:37.322
which is how you discovered a lot of this

244
00:10:37.322 --> 00:10:38.722
in your own body, when you moved

245
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.058
to a wonderful old Victorian,

246
00:10:40.058 --> 00:10:41.725
from what I read in your book, right?

247
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.130
When you moved to a home that started having

248
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.764
high levels of dirty electricity?

249
00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:50.067
<v ->Actually, that is how I actually got into this.</v>

250
00:10:50.067 --> 00:10:53.304
I had a court case with a power utility

251
00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:55.839
fighting a substation of powerlines.

252
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.872
We felt they were too close.

253
00:10:57.872 --> 00:10:58.943
We created a world first

254
00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:00.645
because we were in a ten-day court case

255
00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:02.548
with the electrical utilities.

256
00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:04.484
So I wrote that book for the people,

257
00:11:04.484 --> 00:11:06.617
but what happened, I just talked

258
00:11:06.617 --> 00:11:08.018
about removing dirty electricity.

259
00:11:08.018 --> 00:11:09.621
Just as that was to go to print,

260
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:11.490
I thought, there's something else going on.

261
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.357
'Cause I talked about the magnetic field in that,

262
00:11:13.357 --> 00:11:16.026
so I just touched on dirty electricity

263
00:11:16.026 --> 00:11:18.029
and filters to remove it.

264
00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:20.798
So I had a girl from Victoria,

265
00:11:20.798 --> 00:11:24.135
she contacted me and said, "I've got power lines near me,

266
00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:25.937
"but I've put these filters in my home

267
00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:27.640
"to remove the dirty electricity,

268
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.008
"and I was so debilitated

269
00:11:29.008 --> 00:11:31.275
"and now I have my health back.",

270
00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:34.211
and I felt like what is going on here?

271
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:38.751
So I contacted the creator of the filters, Dave Stetzer,

272
00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:40.217
and I said, I want to know everything,

273
00:11:40.217 --> 00:11:42.487
and then I was contacting more and more people.

274
00:11:42.487 --> 00:11:44.355
So that opened a whole new world.

275
00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:47.460
So I wrote a second book, and then I had so many questions

276
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.525
I've written my third book,

277
00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:52.730
which I'm releasing now, and I couldn't believe it!

278
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.299
It's, you know, I was just starting off about power lines

279
00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:59.370
but the wiring in your house can be more of a problem.

280
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.104
The wiring in your workplace.

281
00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:02.774
The wiring in a school.

282
00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:05.511
That is more important because it's very close to you,

283
00:12:05.511 --> 00:12:08.746
and the dirty electricity is running along the wiring

284
00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:11.015
behind you when you are sleeping.

285
00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:12.716
When you're body's trying to --

286
00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:13.885
<v Regina>To regenerate!</v>

287
00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:18.557
<v ->Yeah, the actual, the radio frequencies</v>

288
00:12:18.557 --> 00:12:22.259
that you don't want, is actually coupling into the body,

289
00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:24.261
and it's messing with it.

290
00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:28.102
It's just all of the signals are just getting all scrambled.

291
00:12:28.102 --> 00:12:30.402
<v Regina>Well, cases in point,</v>

292
00:12:30.402 --> 00:12:32.537
which I found very interesting in your book,

293
00:12:32.537 --> 00:12:33.771
the Amish.

294
00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:34.672
<v ->Yes.</v>

295
00:12:34.672 --> 00:12:37.039
<v Regina>Let's talk about the Amish community in America,</v>

296
00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:39.877
and their cancer rates and give a little background.

297
00:12:39.877 --> 00:12:43.481
<v ->Yes, well, the Amish have been studied excessively,</v>

298
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:47.151
particularly the ones in Ohio?

299
00:12:47.151 --> 00:12:48.254
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

300
00:12:48.254 --> 00:12:51.555
<v ->And they have much lower rates of cancers.</v>

301
00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.691
They have lower rates of prostate cancer.

302
00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:54.859
They have lower rates --

303
00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Regina>And this would be because they're not using</v>

304
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.695
the same amount of electricity.
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

305
00:12:57.695 --> 00:13:00.431
<v ->Well you know they aren't using electricity</v>

306
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.637
<v Regina>Hmm hmm.</v>

307
00:13:01.637 --> 00:13:03.101
<v ->And Milham found that.</v>

308
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:05.570
He found that the places that don't have electricity

309
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.675
have much lower rates of cancer

310
00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:10.075
and they high rates of fertility.

311
00:13:10.075 --> 00:13:11.943
Dr. Milham went so far as to say

312
00:13:11.943 --> 00:13:15.279
that with ADD and ADHD,

313
00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:18.760
the dirty electricity is actually hyping these children up,

314
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.760
and the Amish actually, don't recognize ADD and ADHD,

315
00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:28.893
because they haven't seen it in their children at all,

316
00:13:28.893 --> 00:13:32.863
and the Amish, some of them, are quite large,

317
00:13:32.863 --> 00:13:37.334
but there's virtually, they don't have diabetes.

318
00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:38.769
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

319
00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:43.272
<v ->The electricity is, there's a Type III diabetes,</v>

320
00:13:43.272 --> 00:13:45.276
and that's from an environmental trigger,

321
00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:47.178
and it's from dirty electricity.

322
00:13:47.178 --> 00:13:49.346
<v Regina>Well as your talking, I'm thinking</v>

323
00:13:49.346 --> 00:13:53.617
about, again, it's almost an epidemic in the United States,

324
00:13:53.617 --> 00:13:56.220
in fertility, both male and female,
<v ->Yes.</v>

325
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.189
and people are going through tremendously

326
00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:02.297
expensive procedures, long procedures,

327
00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:07.198
trying to conceive, where in many third-world nations

328
00:14:07.198 --> 00:14:09.581
you have people conceiving very, very, easily

329
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:11.035
where you're living in a very,

330
00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:12.839
what we would consider in the West, primitive condition,

331
00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.173
but very close to the earth, no electricity,

332
00:14:15.173 --> 00:14:17.308
no problem conceiving, lots of children,

333
00:14:17.308 --> 00:14:18.408
and they say, "Oh, it's just cause they're not

334
00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:19.576
"watching TV at night."

335
00:14:19.576 --> 00:14:21.779
No, it's a bigger story than that.

336
00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.248
<v ->It is a much bigger story, because miscarriage</v>

337
00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:27.351
is a none effect from these fields.

338
00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:29.959
Dave Stetzer went to a bank in Wisconsin,

339
00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:32.590
where the women were miscarrying,

340
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.326
and some couldn't fall pregnant.

341
00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:36.394
So removed the dirty electricity.

342
00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:38.829
He put filters in this workplace,

343
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:40.865
got the dirty electricity outside.

344
00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:42.067
The women were then,

345
00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:43.167
when they fell pregnant again,

346
00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:45.603
could actually keep the babies to term,

347
00:14:45.603 --> 00:14:47.538
and the women who couldn't get pregnant,

348
00:14:47.538 --> 00:14:49.474
they fell pregnant within six weeks,

349
00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:51.910
as they all fell pregnant together.

350
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Regina>And the fact is,</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

351
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.145
if you look through our genealogy,

352
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:58.917
all our families, say in the United States, of course,

353
00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:01.052
and I'm sure in the rest of the western world,

354
00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:03.654
it was very common to have five or six children.

355
00:15:03.654 --> 00:15:05.021
You might die in child birth,
<v ->Yes</v>

356
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:06.690
but people conceived rather easily.

357
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.492
<v ->Yes.</v>

358
00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:09.226
<v Regina>So this phenomena is not normal</v>

359
00:15:09.226 --> 00:15:11.729
where a woman cannot get pregnant.

360
00:15:11.729 --> 00:15:13.197
This is not a natural phenomena.
<v ->Yes.</v>

361
00:15:13.197 --> 00:15:15.266
<v ->Yes, dirty electricity is playing</v>

362
00:15:15.266 --> 00:15:18.602
a very big role in that area.

363
00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:21.072
It plays a role in virtually every area,

364
00:15:21.072 --> 00:15:23.607
every disease that you can think of,

365
00:15:23.607 --> 00:15:25.712
because it's the underlying menace.

366
00:15:25.712 --> 00:15:27.364
It is playing some role.

367
00:15:28.112 --> 00:15:30.014
<v Regina>You mentioned hyperactivity in children,</v>

368
00:15:30.014 --> 00:15:33.350
a little bit ago, ADHD, but what about childhood leukemia,

369
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.152
my understanding is it really,

370
00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:37.054
it has an impact on childhood leukemia.

371
00:15:37.054 --> 00:15:38.155
<v ->Yes it does.</v>

372
00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:42.893
Dr. Sam Milham, in a study in 2001, with Ossiander.

373
00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:45.200
He looked at the childhood leukemia peak

374
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.200
in the UK, and the USA, and his conclusion was

375
00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:55.835
that 75%, was it 65 or 75% of childhood leukemia,

376
00:15:56.073 --> 00:15:57.642
could be preventable.

377
00:15:57.642 --> 00:16:00.345
It is due to electrification.

378
00:16:00.345 --> 00:16:03.747
That is a very big statement, but the statistics are there.

379
00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:06.317
Once again, the statistics are there,

380
00:16:06.317 --> 00:16:08.252
and he's an honorable man,

381
00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:11.423
and if he does the statistics, they are actually valid

382
00:16:11.423 --> 00:16:12.741
and they are correct.

383
00:16:13.357 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Regina>What about Dr. Robert O. Becker?</v>

384
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.232
<v ->Oh yes, he was a pioneer in this field.</v>

385
00:16:19.232 --> 00:16:21.800
He was the first westerner to actually state

386
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.635
that we must be careful about these fields,

387
00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:28.372
and he predicted back in 1990, that,

388
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:34.145
he said that these fields are a very good reason

389
00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:36.163
for the origin of cancers.

390
00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:39.082
So he was very strong in his statement.

391
00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:40.651
He passed away a few years ago.

392
00:16:40.651 --> 00:16:43.086
He was just a wonderful man.

393
00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.688
<v Regina>He was a Nobel nominee</v>

394
00:16:44.688 --> 00:16:46.023
a couple of times.
<v ->Twice.</v>

395
00:16:46.023 --> 00:16:48.258
A very, very serious scientist,
<v ->Yes, yes, twice.</v>

396
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.829
And it sounds like he was very well respected.

397
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:51.662
<v ->Extremely well.</v>

398
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:54.698
He was a wonderful man and Dave Stetzer,

399
00:16:54.698 --> 00:16:56.534
the creator of the filters,

400
00:16:56.534 --> 00:17:01.305
he has spoken with him and he was very willing

401
00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:03.308
to give the people the information.

402
00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:05.076
He said that these fields were more

403
00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:06.626
of a concern, than global warming.

404
00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:11.248
<v Regina>And it sounds like a lot of the other factors</v>

405
00:17:11.248 --> 00:17:15.486
in our lives are really secondary to that,

406
00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:18.222
and yesterday when I was listening to your lecture,

407
00:17:18.222 --> 00:17:19.590
someone called you on it,

408
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.026
because you had a statement behind you

409
00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:22.860
made by, I don't know if was Becker,

410
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.661
or someone else, but it essentially said,

411
00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:27.465
smoking, drinking and all these other things

412
00:17:27.465 --> 00:17:29.933
are nothing when compared

413
00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:32.253
to the damage from electrical pollution,

414
00:17:32.253 --> 00:17:34.238
dirty electricity, and a woman said,

415
00:17:34.238 --> 00:17:36.440
"Oh that's not right, we can't smoke and drink

416
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.508
"and live like that."

417
00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:39.510
Well what was the point that was truly being made there?

418
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.182
<v ->Okay, Sam Milham again.</v>

419
00:17:42.182 --> 00:17:44.214
He has all the credentials.

420
00:17:44.214 --> 00:17:46.416
He really can say, whatever he likes,

421
00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:49.353
and he has said we have all heard about lifestyle,

422
00:17:49.353 --> 00:17:51.291
being responsible for diseases.

423
00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:52.690
Don't believe it.

424
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.992
It's all caused by EMF.

425
00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:57.729
And why he said that, he looked at the statistics.

426
00:17:57.729 --> 00:17:59.167
He was shocked himself.

427
00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:01.432
So the statistics are there and he said,

428
00:18:01.432 --> 00:18:04.068
when electricity came in, in the 1880s,

429
00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:06.871
hygiene practices were improving

430
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:08.372
and they were so much better.

431
00:18:08.372 --> 00:18:10.808
We should have all got healthier.

432
00:18:10.808 --> 00:18:12.576
We should all be really healthy,

433
00:18:12.576 --> 00:18:16.181
because of our hygiene practices, but what went wrong?

434
00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:17.752
All of these new plagues came in,

435
00:18:17.752 --> 00:18:20.984
childhood leukemia, breast cancer, asthma,

436
00:18:20.984 --> 00:18:23.020
diabetes, and they all came in?

437
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.455
Why is that?

438
00:18:24.455 --> 00:18:27.258
And he said it is the underlying menace.

439
00:18:27.258 --> 00:18:29.393
You know it's fatigued the immune system.

440
00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:31.528
It can't do anything and its the missing link.

441
00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.138
People say, "I don't smoke.

442
00:18:33.138 --> 00:18:34.164
"I don't drink.

443
00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:35.802
"You know, I really watch my food intake.

444
00:18:35.802 --> 00:18:37.935
"I exercise, I've done all the right things.

445
00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:40.104
"Why do I have cancer?"

446
00:18:40.104 --> 00:18:43.974
This is the reason why there is so much cancer.

447
00:18:43.974 --> 00:18:47.277
<v Regina>So if a person were to take their Jack Daniels,</v>

448
00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:50.581
and their pack of unfiltered cigarettes

449
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:51.985
and go live out in the wilderness,

450
00:18:51.985 --> 00:18:52.716
(Donna laughs)

451
00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:55.120
eat some roots and berries, and smoke and drink,

452
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.387
it wouldn't be the same as trying to do that

453
00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.056
in an electrified environment.

454
00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:01.024
with a totally different consequence.
<v ->Yes.</v>

455
00:19:01.024 --> 00:19:03.995
Perhaps not quite as devastating on the body.
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

456
00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:07.865
<v ->True because, you know, it's the chemicals that we have</v>

457
00:19:07.865 --> 00:19:09.700
and alcohol and all of that.

458
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.235
It plays its part as well.

459
00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:12.036
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

460
00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:14.871
<v ->But if you are in clean electrical environment</v>

461
00:19:14.871 --> 00:19:17.982
then your body is constantly repairing,

462
00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:21.779
so it should be able to repair quicker

463
00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:24.548
and more effectively.

464
00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:27.718
So, yeah, they all have a role,

465
00:19:27.718 --> 00:19:30.087
but this is the most important role,
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

466
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:31.823
and it's so simple.
<v Regina>It makes sense.</v>

467
00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:33.723
It is so easy.
<v Regina>It's so insidious.</v>

468
00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:34.926
Just remove the dirty electricity.

469
00:19:34.926 --> 00:19:35.558
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

470
00:19:35.558 --> 00:19:37.561
<v ->And have your body cleansed.</v>

471
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:40.997
A diabetic can be in a clean electrical environment

472
00:19:40.997 --> 00:19:42.599
then they could walk into a home

473
00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.036
that is a dirty electrical environment

474
00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:46.303
and their blood glucose
<v Regina>Yes!</v>

475
00:19:46.303 --> 00:19:47.671
can just spike.

476
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:50.275
So, they actually filtered this man's home,

477
00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:53.978
he was a diabetic, his blood glucose was 36.

478
00:19:53.978 --> 00:19:56.715
They filtered his house, a week later,

479
00:19:56.715 --> 00:19:58.382
they came back, it was only nine.

480
00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:00.517
It went from 36 to nine.
<v Regina>It's amazing.</v>

481
00:20:00.517 --> 00:20:04.589
That is amazing, you know, so that's very important,

482
00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:06.457
and that research has been presented

483
00:20:06.457 --> 00:20:08.358
to the World Health Organization,

484
00:20:08.358 --> 00:20:11.040
back in 2004, yeah so.

485
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.359
<v Regina>So they're little rays of light --</v>

486
00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:13.464
<v ->Yes</v>

487
00:20:13.464 --> 00:20:14.532
<v Regina>It is coming to attention.</v>

488
00:20:14.532 --> 00:20:17.201
What happened at the La Quinta Middle School in California?

489
00:20:17.201 --> 00:20:19.503
Well, okay, there was a cancer cluster,

490
00:20:19.503 --> 00:20:21.272
it was first deemed that it wasn't.

491
00:20:21.272 --> 00:20:23.073
Sam Milham said, "Yes it is."

492
00:20:23.073 --> 00:20:26.576
Now it was only 18 cancers, in 137 teachers.

493
00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:28.145
That is still a cancer cluster,

494
00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:31.415
so he tried to get through to the normal channels.

495
00:20:31.415 --> 00:20:32.816
They wouldn't let him in.

496
00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.953
So a school teacher named, Gayle Cohen,

497
00:20:34.953 --> 00:20:37.954
she let Sam Milham in and Lloyd Morgan,

498
00:20:37.954 --> 00:20:39.556
he's an electrical engineer,

499
00:20:39.556 --> 00:20:42.693
and he used the actual Stetzerizer Meter.

500
00:20:42.693 --> 00:20:44.327
That is for everybody.

501
00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:47.864
An oscilloscope is $5,000, who can afford that?

502
00:20:47.864 --> 00:20:49.233
They went in with this little meter,

503
00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:51.568
Stetzerizer meter, took the measurements.

504
00:20:51.568 --> 00:20:55.273
Sam actually presented it to the Superintendent of Schools,

505
00:20:55.273 --> 00:20:58.189
and he was threatened with unlawful tresspassing

506
00:20:58.189 --> 00:21:01.078
and the teach was given a letter of reprimand.

507
00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:02.013
<v Regina>Can you believe that?</v>

508
00:21:02.013 --> 00:21:02.712
<v ->Yes, I know.</v>

509
00:21:02.712 --> 00:21:04.581
<v Regina>I know it happens all the time.</v>
<v ->It's very sad.</v>

510
00:21:04.581 --> 00:21:06.987
<v ->It's happening in Australia, all the time.</v>

511
00:21:06.987 --> 00:21:07.918
It's just not good enough.

512
00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:12.155
So the teachers put in a OH and S complaint,

513
00:21:12.155 --> 00:21:14.558
Occupational Health and Safety complaint,

514
00:21:14.558 --> 00:21:16.960
and the California Department of Health

515
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.796
came in and did a proper study,

516
00:21:19.796 --> 00:21:22.265
and that was a ground breaking study,

517
00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:25.703
because it showed that the dirty electricity

518
00:21:25.703 --> 00:21:28.439
caused the cancers in these teachers

519
00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:31.475
in such a very, very short time,

520
00:21:31.475 --> 00:21:35.745
and it showed that the thyroid and malignant melanomas

521
00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:39.884
developed very quickly, so why they are so common now

522
00:21:39.884 --> 00:21:42.219
is due to dirty electricity,

523
00:21:42.219 --> 00:21:45.624
and sadly the students weren't studied,

524
00:21:45.624 --> 00:21:47.991
but Sam Milham has followed them up since

525
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:51.796
and a 19 year-old girl has had her breasts removed,

526
00:21:51.796 --> 00:21:54.798
there's been leukemia, a lot of other cancer cases,

527
00:21:54.798 --> 00:21:57.935
and schools are breeding grounds

528
00:21:57.935 --> 00:22:02.038
for cancer clusters as well as call centers.

529
00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:04.107
<v Regina>Yeah, that makes sense.</v>
<v ->For breast cancer.</v>

530
00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:06.143
Yeah, call centers where you have a lot of electricity,

531
00:22:06.143 --> 00:22:07.844
a lot of phones moving, yeah.

532
00:22:07.844 --> 00:22:09.846
<v ->Yeah and it's everywhere.</v>

533
00:22:09.846 --> 00:22:10.681
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

534
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:12.115
<v ->It is everywhere.</v>

535
00:22:12.115 --> 00:22:13.616
It is such a big problem,

536
00:22:13.616 --> 00:22:16.353
and people have to protect themselves.

537
00:22:16.353 --> 00:22:18.022
There's already one country

538
00:22:18.022 --> 00:22:20.941
protecting its citizens, but for the rest of the world

539
00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:22.663
we actually have to protect ourselves --

540
00:22:22.663 --> 00:22:24.127
<v Regina>Because our governments</v>
<v ->that's why I write about its.</v>

541
00:22:24.127 --> 00:22:26.531
aren't going to be informing us anytime soon.

542
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:30.233
<v ->No, no, and that's why I wrote the book.</v>

543
00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:32.669
It's just, it's simple information.

544
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:35.172
I've broken it down into everyday language.

545
00:22:35.172 --> 00:22:36.741
<v Regina>You have it's very easy</v>
<v ->The technical, the scientific.</v>

546
00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:38.876
to get through but packed with information.

547
00:22:38.876 --> 00:22:39.676
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

548
00:22:39.676 --> 00:22:40.545
<v Regina>I mean we didn't get into</v>

549
00:22:40.545 --> 00:22:41.846
a lot of the anecdotal things,

550
00:22:41.846 --> 00:22:44.350
because I think people can grok from what you're saying.

551
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.050
You have many case scenarios

552
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.554
of some of the dire consequences

553
00:22:50.554 --> 00:22:53.390
of having this electro-sensitivity,

554
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.494
electromagnetic sensitivity or just electric.

555
00:22:55.494 --> 00:22:56.561
What do you call it?

556
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:58.062
ES, is it electro-sensitivity?

557
00:22:58.062 --> 00:23:00.332
<v ->It's called electro-hypersensitivity.</v>

558
00:23:00.332 --> 00:23:01.666
<v Regina>Electro-hypersensitivity.</v>

559
00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:03.300
<v ->And then it's shortened to EHS.</v>

560
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:03.835
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

561
00:23:03.835 --> 00:23:04.669
<v ->Yes.</v>

562
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:06.169
<v Regina>And a couple of other things</v>

563
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:07.810
I want to talk to you about within that,

564
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.807
and again, I encourage people to buy the book

565
00:23:09.807 --> 00:23:12.343
to read that and also to see some of the anecdotes

566
00:23:12.343 --> 00:23:13.482
that you have in there,

567
00:23:13.482 --> 00:23:16.647
and we're talking about EMFs and also there,

568
00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:19.449
how it affects the complete blood count.

569
00:23:19.449 --> 00:23:21.221
That was fascinating and you have

570
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:22.419
some pictures of that as well.

571
00:23:22.419 --> 00:23:23.020
<v ->Yes.</v>

572
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.921
<v Regina>Can you talk about the affect on the blood?</v>

573
00:23:24.921 --> 00:23:27.692
<v ->Yes, if you have live-blood analysis they,</v>

574
00:23:27.692 --> 00:23:32.692
all of the little circles should be all separate.

575
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.732
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

576
00:23:33.732 --> 00:23:36.933
<v ->What they're finding with these EMFs</v>

577
00:23:36.933 --> 00:23:38.769
and with a DECT phone,

578
00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.503
they're actually clamping.

579
00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:42.606
So it looks like it's stacked.

580
00:23:42.606 --> 00:23:43.474
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

581
00:23:43.474 --> 00:23:45.378
<v ->And that is not good at all.</v>

582
00:23:45.378 --> 00:23:47.213
And even if you sit at a computer

583
00:23:47.213 --> 00:23:49.413
in a dirty electrical field, it clamps.

584
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.550
They should be nicely spaced.

585
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.619
So that's only very new research.

586
00:23:55.619 --> 00:23:57.821
So there will be a lot more research done --

587
00:23:57.821 --> 00:23:58.389
<v Regina>Okay</v>

588
00:23:58.389 --> 00:24:01.392
<v ->In that area, because it is a very, very good test,</v>

589
00:24:01.392 --> 00:24:05.228
and they're finding overseas that some people

590
00:24:05.228 --> 00:24:09.466
in some areas near cell phone antennas,

591
00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:13.570
that they are all going and having a live blood analysis.

592
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.738
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

593
00:24:14.738 --> 00:24:16.873
<v ->Which is great for court proceedings.</v>

594
00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:18.935
<v Regina>Well the good news about all of it,</v>

595
00:24:18.935 --> 00:24:20.644
from what I understood yesterday,

596
00:24:20.644 --> 00:24:22.845
and we're going to have the honor

597
00:24:22.845 --> 00:24:24.714
of interviewing him in a few moments --

598
00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:25.415
<v ->Yes.</v>

599
00:24:25.415 --> 00:24:26.237
<v Regina>Is Dave Stetzter.</v>

600
00:24:26.237 --> 00:24:26.786
<v ->Yes!</v>

601
00:24:26.786 --> 00:24:28.284
<v Regina>Which you've researched,</v>

602
00:24:28.284 --> 00:24:31.555
you've used his meter, you've used the air filters,

603
00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:33.223
but you never met him until yesterday.

604
00:24:33.223 --> 00:24:34.257
<v ->No.</v>

605
00:24:34.257 --> 00:24:36.327
<v Regina>What a sweet, modest man,</v>

606
00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:38.429
but he has every reason not to be,

607
00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:40.864
because let's talk about Dave for just a little bit,

608
00:24:40.864 --> 00:24:42.467
because you'll be introducing him,
<v ->Yes!</v>

609
00:24:42.467 --> 00:24:44.301
in a sense, 'cause he's not gonna say much
<v ->Yes.</v>

610
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:45.469
about himself.
<v ->No he isn't.</v>

611
00:24:45.469 --> 00:24:46.436
He's all about the information.

612
00:24:46.436 --> 00:24:49.006
Tell us about Dave, what he's done, what's happened,

613
00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:50.440
as a result of his work.

614
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.642
<v ->Yes, what Dave did, he saw a problem</v>

615
00:24:52.642 --> 00:24:55.312
with the farmers, with the cows.

616
00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:57.883
The cows were having deformed offspring

617
00:24:57.883 --> 00:25:00.316
and they weren't producing as much milk.

618
00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:01.618
So he wanted to know why.

619
00:25:01.618 --> 00:25:04.755
He also noticed that the farmer's families were sick,

620
00:25:04.755 --> 00:25:08.625
so he was the man who started on all of this,

621
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:10.594
and he just wanted to know why

622
00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:12.061
and it was the dirty electricity

623
00:25:12.061 --> 00:25:14.097
that was skimming along the ground.

624
00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:16.601
He's the man who went to Russia,

625
00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:18.735
you know, and his meetings in Russia,

626
00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:20.227
they really wanted to know who he was

627
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:22.106
and why he wanted their research,

628
00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:24.409
but they slowly opened up to him

629
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:26.443
and he's been to Kazakhstan,

630
00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:28.780
he's talked to scientists in the Ukraine,

631
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.918
and they've been studying this for years,

632
00:25:30.918 --> 00:25:33.783
so he has been the man.

633
00:25:33.783 --> 00:25:37.020
He's the one, he got all of the research proved.

634
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.858
He had a conference over in Kazakhstan,

635
00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:44.131
and due to his persistency, he is going to save,

636
00:25:44.131 --> 00:25:46.763
and he has already, but he's saving millions of lives.

637
00:25:46.763 --> 00:25:49.566
He's making the quality of life better for so many people,

638
00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:52.835
and with creating this actual meter,

639
00:25:52.835 --> 00:25:56.173
with the dirty electricity, a brand new term

640
00:25:56.173 --> 00:25:58.742
has been named in his honor.

641
00:25:58.742 --> 00:26:02.846
This new term called a GS Unit, is a brand new,

642
00:26:02.846 --> 00:26:04.481
it's an electrical word for the whole world,

643
00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:06.216
it's a real paradigm shift,

644
00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:09.620
and it's named after Martin Graham and Dave Stetzer,

645
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.025
so it's Graham-Stetzer, it's a GS Unit,

646
00:26:12.025 --> 00:26:15.359
and that is indeed a historical honor.

647
00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:17.261
Everybody should shake his hand,

648
00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:18.695
as I said yesterday.

649
00:26:18.695 --> 00:26:20.533
<v Regina>This is like the Gauss meter, right?</v>

650
00:26:20.533 --> 00:26:23.135
<v ->Yes, like the Gauss tesla
<v Regina>Like Carl Gauss and tesla.</v>

651
00:26:23.135 --> 00:26:25.769
<v Regina>This is on that order of magnitude.</v>

652
00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:27.805
<v ->Yes exactly.</v>

653
00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:30.239
He's an expert witness for the farmers.

654
00:26:30.239 --> 00:26:33.276
Last year he was in a court case in the stand

655
00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:34.578
for three weeks.

656
00:26:34.578 --> 00:26:39.578
They really tried to discredit his research, but it's valid.

657
00:26:39.584 --> 00:26:42.089
It's been validated in one country.

658
00:26:42.089 --> 00:26:45.521
They're protecting his workers and what he says,

659
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:48.058
it's full-stopped, don't argue with him.

660
00:26:48.058 --> 00:26:52.196
Honor him, shake his hand, and say, "Thank you.",

661
00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:54.376
'cause you might not think it's thinking you,

662
00:26:54.376 --> 00:26:56.600
you know, like it's helping you now,

663
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.034
but it will help you in the future.

664
00:26:58.034 --> 00:26:59.170
It will help your family.

665
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.705
Filtering your electricity, removing the dirty electricity,

666
00:27:01.705 --> 00:27:04.307
it will be an automatic process in society.

667
00:27:04.307 --> 00:27:06.232
<v Regina>In the future, it will be built in.</v>
<v ->Yeah, like in 20 years.</v>

668
00:27:06.232 --> 00:27:06.710
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

669
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.078
<v ->We will all be doing it,</v>

670
00:27:08.078 --> 00:27:09.479
unless you've heard about my books

671
00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:12.215
or heard about Dave's work,

672
00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:14.918
and this is really his first public outing

673
00:27:14.918 --> 00:27:17.087
in something like this, an expo.

674
00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:17.954
<v Regina>I feel honored.</v>

675
00:27:17.954 --> 00:27:19.522
<v ->Yes, we are all honored.</v>

676
00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:21.492
He has come to actually train people,

677
00:27:21.492 --> 00:27:23.093
and spread the word.

678
00:27:23.093 --> 00:27:24.094
He's amazing!

679
00:27:24.094 --> 00:27:26.463
You know, I have pestered this man with so many questions,

680
00:27:26.463 --> 00:27:27.833
and he loves my book.

681
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:30.367
My last book he said, "I've read it three times Donna,

682
00:27:30.367 --> 00:27:33.169
"and I can't fault it on an engineering level.",

683
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:35.906
and that is such a --

684
00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:36.406
<v Regina>What a high compliment.</v>
<v ->fabulous statement, yeah.</v>

685
00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:38.475
<v ->He's a very humble man.</v>

686
00:27:38.475 --> 00:27:40.444
<v Regina>So he created filters</v>

687
00:27:40.444 --> 00:27:43.780
that essentially block the biologically

688
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.682
damaging range of electricity.

689
00:27:45.682 --> 00:27:47.216
<v ->Yes, it's shorting it out.</v>

690
00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:48.053
<v Regina>Yeah, it shorts it out</v>

691
00:27:48.053 --> 00:27:50.787
<v ->Cause dirty electricity, we're creating it --</v>

692
00:27:50.787 --> 00:27:51.856
<v Regina>And they're cheap!</v>

693
00:27:51.856 --> 00:27:52.856
And they're cheap!

694
00:27:52.856 --> 00:27:53.857
<v ->They are so affordable.</v>

695
00:27:53.857 --> 00:27:55.425
<v Regina>And he did the same thing with this meter,</v>

696
00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:58.729
because, again, he's a person who's trying to help educate

697
00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:00.797
people around the planet and to easily

698
00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:02.798
and accessibly find out their levels

699
00:28:02.798 --> 00:28:04.401
of potential danger in their own homes.

700
00:28:04.401 --> 00:28:07.472
<v ->Yes, that is true and the actual meter</v>

701
00:28:07.472 --> 00:28:09.239
is the intellectual property

702
00:28:09.239 --> 00:28:12.976
of Professor Emeritus, Martin Graham.

703
00:28:12.976 --> 00:28:15.024
They say he is a genius.

704
00:28:15.024 --> 00:28:17.866
Now Martin Graham, he actually,

705
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:21.384
he created the technology for the ICBM,

706
00:28:21.384 --> 00:28:25.088
as in he created the actual missile guidance system,

707
00:28:25.088 --> 00:28:26.556
so when the missile goes up --

708
00:28:26.556 --> 00:28:27.524
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

709
00:28:27.524 --> 00:28:29.793
<v ->He actually, he had the guidance system</v>

710
00:28:29.793 --> 00:28:31.462
so it knows where to go.

711
00:28:31.462 --> 00:28:33.496
He gave that to the government.

712
00:28:33.496 --> 00:28:34.464
He's a genius.

713
00:28:34.464 --> 00:28:37.134
<v Regina>And he's essentially giving this technology</v>

714
00:28:37.134 --> 00:28:38.102
to the public.
<v ->Yeah!</v>

715
00:28:38.102 --> 00:28:41.171
It's what, in the formal technologies,

716
00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:44.308
like the devices are like $5,000 right,

717
00:28:44.308 --> 00:28:47.010
for this detection and they're doing one for $100.

718
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:48.045
<v ->Yes, $100.</v>

719
00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:49.446
<v Regina>So your whole family,</v>

720
00:28:49.446 --> 00:28:50.713
your extended family can buy one and go around

721
00:28:50.713 --> 00:28:51.884
all your homes and friends homes

722
00:28:51.884 --> 00:28:53.249
and find out what's going on.

723
00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:54.885
That's a gift!

724
00:28:54.885 --> 00:28:56.687
That's a gift to the planet.

725
00:28:56.687 --> 00:28:59.423
<v ->It sure is and he is such a humble man.</v>

726
00:28:59.423 --> 00:29:01.191
It's just amazing.

727
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:02.793
I'm so glad I've met him!

728
00:29:02.793 --> 00:29:04.561
I've asked him so many questions,

729
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:06.629
and he's been so obliging.

730
00:29:06.629 --> 00:29:09.266
So my book, is his work,

731
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:11.440
but it's at the level of the people.

732
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.435
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

733
00:29:12.435 --> 00:29:14.872
<v ->Because he just spins off all of the knowledge,</v>

734
00:29:14.872 --> 00:29:17.207
the voltage and current, but I've put it in

735
00:29:17.207 --> 00:29:20.110
such a condensed version, lots of examples.

736
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.181
It's pretty simple, just read the book, get the meter,

737
00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:26.150
remove the dirty electricity,

738
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.520
we will all be so much healthier

739
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.857
and then we can start to look at everything else, nutrition

740
00:29:32.857 --> 00:29:36.025
but get the electrical working in your body.

741
00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:38.128
<v Regina>So your cells have a fighting chance</v>

742
00:29:38.128 --> 00:29:39.228
of signalling each other,

743
00:29:39.228 --> 00:29:41.066
signalling each other, correctly to begin with.

744
00:29:41.066 --> 00:29:41.665
<v ->Yes.</v>

745
00:29:41.665 --> 00:29:43.167
<v Regina>And then perhaps we can even absorb</v>

746
00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:44.934
some of those nutrients better.

747
00:29:44.934 --> 00:29:46.970
<v ->That is so correct, you know.</v>

748
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.306
They've removed the dirty electricity

749
00:29:49.306 --> 00:29:51.274
in children with autism improving.

750
00:29:51.274 --> 00:29:53.143
they filtered a whole school,

751
00:29:53.143 --> 00:29:55.048
and the 37 students who had asthma,

752
00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:57.714
didn't need to use their inhalers anymore.

753
00:29:57.714 --> 00:30:00.417
Like, wow, the man who brought the filters to Australia,

754
00:30:00.417 --> 00:30:03.619
he had multiple sclerosis, really bad with a cane,

755
00:30:03.619 --> 00:30:05.021
and Dave Stetzer said to him,

756
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:07.757
he said, "Steve, if your multiple sclerosis

757
00:30:07.757 --> 00:30:09.826
"is caused from dirty electricity,

758
00:30:09.826 --> 00:30:12.162
"if you put enough filters in your home

759
00:30:12.162 --> 00:30:14.730
"to get the meter down to the right level,

760
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.500
"you will go into remission

761
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.570
"in around a year's time."

762
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.003
And he did!

763
00:30:20.003 --> 00:30:21.003
I have his testimony!
<v Regina>Wow!</v>

764
00:30:21.003 --> 00:30:22.038
<v Regina>That's huge!</v>

765
00:30:22.038 --> 00:30:23.507
I mean this is just huge.
<v ->That is huge!</v>

766
00:30:23.507 --> 00:30:25.875
<v ->Yes, because it's affecting the central nervous system,</v>

767
00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:29.012
dirty electricity, it's redistributing

768
00:30:29.012 --> 00:30:31.614
the metals in the body.

769
00:30:31.614 --> 00:30:33.683
Where's it going to go?
<v Regina>And we're already toxic.</v>

770
00:30:33.683 --> 00:30:34.887
To the brain!

771
00:30:34.887 --> 00:30:36.588
<v Regina>Yes, and we're already have</v>

772
00:30:36.588 --> 00:30:38.021
all this amalgam in our mouths,

773
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:39.789
and everything else, breaking down

774
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:42.325
and gathering in our tissues,

775
00:30:42.325 --> 00:30:45.761
and I can't even fathom what a messy cocktail it is

776
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.364
in there when you add electricity to it.

777
00:30:48.364 --> 00:30:50.099
But I appreciate, I can't tell you how much

778
00:30:50.099 --> 00:30:51.836
I appreciate the work that you're doing

779
00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:53.070
and that you've put this together

780
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.838
in such an accessible manner.

781
00:30:54.838 --> 00:30:56.840
It made my research easy.

782
00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.059
Any final thoughts, before we talk to Dave?

783
00:30:59.542 --> 00:31:02.513
<v ->Ah, the book really covers everything.</v>

784
00:31:02.513 --> 00:31:03.413
<v Regina>It does, yeah.</v>
<v ->It's simple.</v>

785
00:31:03.413 --> 00:31:04.414
<v ->It's easy,</v>

786
00:31:04.414 --> 00:31:06.482
I have a non-profit organization in Australia

787
00:31:06.482 --> 00:31:11.355
and we are striving to help the people be protected.

788
00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:14.023
It's very, very much a challenge.

789
00:31:14.023 --> 00:31:16.559
There's a lot of closed minds out there,

790
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.561
but we've basically covered everything.

791
00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:20.264
It's the underlying menace,

792
00:31:20.264 --> 00:31:22.399
and the Russians have spoken,

793
00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.767
they've said it, don't argue with them.

794
00:31:24.767 --> 00:31:25.235
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

795
00:31:25.235 --> 00:31:25.701
<v ->Just protect yourself.</v>

796
00:31:25.701 --> 00:31:28.204
It's up to you.

797
00:31:28.204 --> 00:31:28.874
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

798
00:31:28.874 --> 00:31:31.240
<v ->And you know it'll be a long time before</v>

799
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.410
something like this is compulsory.

800
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.245
It should be compulsory now.

801
00:31:35.245 --> 00:31:37.547
It will come, but I don't want to be exposed

802
00:31:37.547 --> 00:31:40.416
to another day of dirty electricity,

803
00:31:40.416 --> 00:31:43.999
because Milham says at La Quinta,

804
00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:47.557
if you're exposed to six hours a day

805
00:31:47.557 --> 00:31:50.760
for 180 days a year, so that's when you sleep

806
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.898
for six months, and the reading is over 2,000

807
00:31:54.898 --> 00:31:59.898
you've increased your cancers by 25% each year.

808
00:32:00.069 --> 00:32:01.137
<v Regina>Each year.</v>

809
00:32:01.137 --> 00:32:01.871
<v ->It is --</v>

810
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:02.606
<v Regina>Compounded.</v>

811
00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:04.341
<v ->Yeah it is the biggest struggle.</v>

812
00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:06.376
The legal experts say it will be bigger

813
00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:10.113
than the cigarette smoking and asbestos issues combined,

814
00:32:10.113 --> 00:32:12.515
because people choose to smoke,

815
00:32:12.515 --> 00:32:14.383
but dirty electricity is everywhere.

816
00:32:14.383 --> 00:32:17.161
If you have wiring in your home, it's comin' in.

817
00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:18.288
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

818
00:32:18.288 --> 00:32:19.756
Donna, thank you so much for your time

819
00:32:19.756 --> 00:32:20.857
and for your work.

820
00:32:20.857 --> 00:32:21.892
<v ->Oh, thank you very much.</v>

821
00:32:21.892 --> 00:32:23.160
It's an honor to be in America.

822
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.595
I love America!

823
00:32:24.595 --> 00:32:25.561
Yeah, thank you.

824
00:32:29.541 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Regina>Dave, first of all,</v>

825
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.536
what is it that the Russians have known

826
00:32:33.536 --> 00:32:35.338
for quite a while that the rest of us

827
00:32:35.338 --> 00:32:36.673
seem to be ignoring?

828
00:32:36.673 --> 00:32:39.142
<v ->Well what happened is at the end of World War II,</v>

829
00:32:39.142 --> 00:32:41.044
radar was developed,

830
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:43.413
and the Russians noticed that the people

831
00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:45.681
who worked with radar and transmitters

832
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:48.985
and receivers, they had symptoms,

833
00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:51.254
a set of symptoms, hair falling out,

834
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.726
things like this, okay,

835
00:32:55.726 --> 00:32:57.861
chronically fatigued, things like that.

836
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:00.730
So what happened was they came to the United States,

837
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.731
and they met in Arizona,

838
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:04.167
which a bunch of American scientists

839
00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:07.537
and they said, you know, look we should develop standards

840
00:33:07.537 --> 00:33:10.539
so exposure rates for people,

841
00:33:10.539 --> 00:33:12.142
and, of course, the United States,

842
00:33:12.142 --> 00:33:13.977
it was the beginning, it was during the Cold War,

843
00:33:13.977 --> 00:33:16.012
so they said, okay, look, go back home,

844
00:33:16.012 --> 00:33:17.714
you're a third-world country or whatever.

845
00:33:17.714 --> 00:33:19.550
So they went back home and they actually

846
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.439
developed weapons and they did a lot of research on this,

847
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.074
on exposure to high frequencies.

848
00:33:27.858 --> 00:33:29.959
<v Regina>And they also started taking</v>

849
00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:33.296
a much more proactive stance in Kazakhstan, right,

850
00:33:33.296 --> 00:33:35.264
I mean in recent times.

851
00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:35.789
<v ->Well.</v>

852
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:36.599
<v Regina>But even when we're looking at</v>

853
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:39.236
household microwaves, like microwave ovens,

854
00:33:39.236 --> 00:33:40.737
can you talk about, a little bit,

855
00:33:40.737 --> 00:33:43.573
of how that's trickled down to actual action?

856
00:33:43.573 --> 00:33:47.076
<v ->When we associate like, they had something</v>

857
00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:49.112
called radio-wave sickness was the disease

858
00:33:49.112 --> 00:33:51.982
and that's basically, it's exposure to high frequency
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

859
00:33:51.982 --> 00:33:55.518
And so what happened is when we associate,

860
00:33:55.518 --> 00:33:57.187
when we're looking at exposure to high frequency

861
00:33:57.187 --> 00:33:58.221
we're looking at maybe living

862
00:33:58.221 --> 00:33:59.990
next to a military installation,

863
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.092
or some sort of tower, or something like that,
<v Regina>Hmm hmm.</v>

864
00:34:02.092 --> 00:34:04.461
but what they didn't even realize

865
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:07.364
was that it's now on our building's wires,

866
00:34:07.364 --> 00:34:10.133
with the advent of modern-day electronic devices

867
00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:13.602
then we have the, we chop up the current,

868
00:34:13.602 --> 00:34:15.538
the sign wave is chopped up and we use current

869
00:34:15.538 --> 00:34:18.075
in a different manner, and it creates high frequency

870
00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:21.143
transients and harmonics that go back on the wires,

871
00:34:21.143 --> 00:34:23.846
and it goes everywhere in all the wires in the house,

872
00:34:23.846 --> 00:34:25.614
and your home and your office buildings

873
00:34:25.614 --> 00:34:29.185
and then it goes back on the grid.

874
00:34:29.185 --> 00:34:31.522
So the Russians are not exempt from that.

875
00:34:31.522 --> 00:34:34.491
They use a similar type of electrical system we do,

876
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:37.393
and so they still have computers, energy-efficient lighting,

877
00:34:37.393 --> 00:34:40.229
variable frequency drives, things like that,

878
00:34:40.229 --> 00:34:43.567
and so they actually were quite surprised

879
00:34:43.567 --> 00:34:45.801
that it was on the building's wires,

880
00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:47.971
and, of course, I was in Kazakhstan,

881
00:34:47.971 --> 00:34:50.306
and when I showed 'em that,

882
00:34:50.306 --> 00:34:52.575
they said, "Oh this is very dangerous.

883
00:34:52.575 --> 00:34:54.144
"You can't be exposed to these types

884
00:34:54.144 --> 00:34:55.678
"of frequencies right away."

885
00:34:55.678 --> 00:34:59.848
So they did some research and they have standards now,

886
00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:02.001
that they put into effect right away.

887
00:35:02.756 --> 00:35:04.255
<v Regina>Which, are they the most,</v>

888
00:35:04.255 --> 00:35:06.389
is that the most progressive region in the world,

889
00:35:06.389 --> 00:35:08.090
in terms of having standards.

890
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.026
Are there other countries that have adopted

891
00:35:10.026 --> 00:35:11.227
some of these standards?

892
00:35:11.227 --> 00:35:15.465
<v ->Israel has standards on EMFs, very strong standards.</v>

893
00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:19.503
Kazakhstan is one of the very few countries

894
00:35:19.503 --> 00:35:21.438
that used the meter that was developed

895
00:35:21.438 --> 00:35:24.340
by Professor Martin Graham, from UC Berkeley.

896
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.942
They calibrated it against the oscilloscope,

897
00:35:26.942 --> 00:35:28.311
because their health department,

898
00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:29.412
they didn't have the kind,

899
00:35:29.412 --> 00:35:30.294
we us an oscilloscope.
<v Regina>Hmm hmm.</v>

900
00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.615
I use, when I measure in expert

901
00:35:31.615 --> 00:35:33.949
I need to see the wave form and things like that,

902
00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:35.418
so I use a oscilloscope.

903
00:35:35.418 --> 00:35:37.654
But a oscilloscope cost about $5,000,

904
00:35:37.654 --> 00:35:39.888
so the average person can't afford oscilloscope

905
00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:41.324
and neither can the government,

906
00:35:41.324 --> 00:35:46.324
they said well look we can't buy oscilloscopes

907
00:35:46.329 --> 00:35:48.722
for all our health department personnel --

908
00:35:48.722 --> 00:35:49.610
<v Regina>Right.</v>

909
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.132
<v ->and tell them how to use it,</v>

910
00:35:50.132 --> 00:35:51.535
and go out and measure this stuff.

911
00:35:51.535 --> 00:35:53.236
So can you make us a meter

912
00:35:53.236 --> 00:35:56.373
that measures not the 50-cycle there,

913
00:35:56.373 --> 00:35:59.109
and here it'd be 60-cycle, but the energy,

914
00:35:59.109 --> 00:36:02.011
the high-frequency energy that's on that wire --

915
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:02.545
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

916
00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:03.713
<v ->And make us a meter.</v>

917
00:36:03.713 --> 00:36:06.015
And, of course, I said, "Well, I can't, it's beyond me,

918
00:36:06.015 --> 00:36:08.117
"but Professor Martin Graham probably can.",

919
00:36:08.117 --> 00:36:10.521
and he did, he made the meter.

920
00:36:10.521 --> 00:36:11.154
They took the meter.

921
00:36:11.154 --> 00:36:13.690
They calibrated it, at what we would probably

922
00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.258
call our bureau standards,

923
00:36:15.258 --> 00:36:17.159
and they came out with a decree

924
00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:19.329
that said, "You can't have more than 50

925
00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:21.898
"on this meter, in any public place."

926
00:36:22.799 --> 00:36:23.933
<v Regina>And so it makes it very simple for</v>

927
00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:25.368
the layperson to read this meter.

928
00:36:25.368 --> 00:36:26.001
<v ->Yes.</v>

929
00:36:26.001 --> 00:36:27.237
<v Regina>Essentially, here's your healthy level,</v>

930
00:36:27.237 --> 00:36:28.338
and here's you unhealthy level.

931
00:36:28.338 --> 00:36:32.608
But this most specifically, this is targeting

932
00:36:32.608 --> 00:36:34.778
the frequencies between what,

933
00:36:34.778 --> 00:36:37.580
one and 150 kilohertz, is that correct or?

934
00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.814
How does that work?

935
00:36:38.814 --> 00:36:41.650
<v ->The most biologically active frequencies</v>

936
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.406
are between four kilohertz and 100 kilohertz.

937
00:36:44.406 --> 00:36:45.422
<v Regina>Hmm hmm.</v>

938
00:36:45.422 --> 00:36:48.491
<v ->And so when we designed a filter then,</v>

939
00:36:48.491 --> 00:36:52.695
to take out between two kilohertz and 150 kilohertz,

940
00:36:52.695 --> 00:36:55.181
as a frequency response, it takes that out.

941
00:36:56.098 --> 00:36:59.788
<v Regina>So, when you have one of these meters,</v>

942
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.574
you can detect from that numeric,

943
00:37:04.574 --> 00:37:05.476
that you're talking about,

944
00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:09.179
you're using a very functional understandable numeric then,

945
00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:11.381
as to what's going on in your home

946
00:37:11.381 --> 00:37:13.883
that is functioning within, or interfering within

947
00:37:13.883 --> 00:37:16.553
a biologically damaging range.

948
00:37:16.553 --> 00:37:17.354
<v ->That's correct.</v>

949
00:37:17.354 --> 00:37:19.489
You plug the meter in, there's no settings,

950
00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:22.526
anything like that, we made it very simple.

951
00:37:22.526 --> 00:37:24.526
It just has a AC cord on it.

952
00:37:24.526 --> 00:37:26.566
You plug it into your AC receptacle.

953
00:37:26.566 --> 00:37:28.798
You're gonna get a number.

954
00:37:28.798 --> 00:37:30.500
It's a numeric number.

955
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.903
It only reads up to 1,999, so but --

956
00:37:33.903 --> 00:37:34.640
<v Regina>Right.</v>

957
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.206
<v ->Which would be very, very high,</v>

958
00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:39.709
because 50 is what Kazakhstan, says is acceptable.

959
00:37:39.709 --> 00:37:40.377
<v Regina>Right.</v>

960
00:37:40.377 --> 00:37:41.677
<v ->If you took the human body,</v>

961
00:37:41.677 --> 00:37:45.615
and you made it into an electrical model,

962
00:37:45.615 --> 00:37:48.451
it would look like three resistors and two capacitors.

963
00:37:48.451 --> 00:37:51.387
Capacitors are a short to high frequency.

964
00:37:51.387 --> 00:37:54.656
So any energy, that's above 1.7 kilohertz,

965
00:37:54.656 --> 00:37:56.759
and the Russians were only to two kilohertz,

966
00:37:56.759 --> 00:37:59.595
that will dissipate internal to the human body.

967
00:37:59.595 --> 00:38:01.564
So if you plug this meter in, and the meter

968
00:38:01.564 --> 00:38:04.500
reads above 50, generally speaking,

969
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.302
it's above two kilohertz.

970
00:38:06.302 --> 00:38:08.805
<v Regina>Okay, so we can just take that translate,</v>

971
00:38:08.805 --> 00:38:10.309
and people have an opportunity through

972
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:12.476
Donna's book and other means to --

973
00:38:12.476 --> 00:38:13.942
<v ->To get more take.
<v Regina>To get some of the background.</v>

974
00:38:13.942 --> 00:38:16.347
<v Regina>Yeah, to get some of the science behind it.</v>

975
00:38:16.347 --> 00:38:20.383
So you were personally inspired because

976
00:38:20.383 --> 00:38:21.684
of some of the work you had done

977
00:38:21.684 --> 00:38:23.054
with the farmers, obviously, right.

978
00:38:23.054 --> 00:38:25.422
<v ->That's correct.
<v Regina>Initially, because of the farmers.</v>

979
00:38:25.422 --> 00:38:29.024
<v Regina>And then you wanted to find something</v>

980
00:38:29.024 --> 00:38:32.629
that was a solution that was affordable for people

981
00:38:32.629 --> 00:38:34.765
and also necessary at this point in history,

982
00:38:34.765 --> 00:38:36.665
because it's not built into our systems yet,

983
00:38:36.665 --> 00:38:38.767
and created a filter system.

984
00:38:38.767 --> 00:38:40.136
Can you talk a little bit about

985
00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:43.672
how electrical filtering works to begin with?

986
00:38:43.672 --> 00:38:44.707
<v ->Well it's nothing new.</v>

987
00:38:44.707 --> 00:38:48.377
It's not a novel idea, or something like that.

988
00:38:48.377 --> 00:38:49.278
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

989
00:38:49.278 --> 00:38:53.416
<v ->Anybody who's went to any sort of electronics class</v>

990
00:38:53.416 --> 00:38:58.087
or school, learns about capacitors in AC circuits

991
00:38:58.087 --> 00:39:00.390
and that's about two weeks into the school.

992
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.160
So what happened originally,

993
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.300
was I was working with some dairy farms

994
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.194
and they were complaining about their cows

995
00:39:06.194 --> 00:39:07.997
not producing milk and becoming ill,

996
00:39:07.997 --> 00:39:11.702
having miscarriages, absorbing, things like that.

997
00:39:11.702 --> 00:39:14.915
So what I did was, I took measurements,

998
00:39:14.915 --> 00:39:17.140
but then the farmers would say,

999
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.674
"You know this doesn't affect just the cows,

1000
00:39:18.674 --> 00:39:21.878
"it affects my wife, my daughter comes here

1001
00:39:21.878 --> 00:39:25.182
"for a visit, she has a miscarriage.", things like this.

1002
00:39:25.981 --> 00:39:27.517
<v Regina>Why dairy farms?</v>

1003
00:39:29.484 --> 00:39:33.156
<v ->Dairy farms, I got involved in that because of the cows,</v>

1004
00:39:33.156 --> 00:39:35.057
because I'm a metering expert,

1005
00:39:35.057 --> 00:39:38.295
and there's a term called stray voltage,

1006
00:39:38.295 --> 00:39:41.063
where the voltage accessed the cows

1007
00:39:41.063 --> 00:39:44.199
and a lot of controversy about that,

1008
00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:46.035
so I went out to measure it

1009
00:39:46.035 --> 00:39:49.238
for one of our clients, and I found this,

1010
00:39:49.238 --> 00:39:50.340
and the people were telling me,

1011
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.144
"Hey look, this causes people problems with,

1012
00:39:55.144 --> 00:39:57.947
"you know, our health with people."

1013
00:39:57.947 --> 00:40:02.284
So I knew about radio wave sickness

1014
00:40:02.284 --> 00:40:04.853
when I was in the military, we had classes on it.

1015
00:40:04.853 --> 00:40:07.457
But when the people talked about their symptoms,

1016
00:40:07.457 --> 00:40:08.890
I'd heard those symptoms before,

1017
00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.694
but that was back in like the 1972 era,

1018
00:40:11.694 --> 00:40:14.096
but it was like, okay, again,

1019
00:40:14.096 --> 00:40:15.565
we didn't have a lot of cell phones then,

1020
00:40:15.565 --> 00:40:16.832
we didn't have DECT phones,

1021
00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:18.167
the wireless internet wasn't around.

1022
00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:22.038
This is back in 1998, and so when they're saying that,

1023
00:40:22.038 --> 00:40:25.642
again, we associate being exposed to high frequency

1024
00:40:25.642 --> 00:40:29.679
to like, living next to a radar base or something,

1025
00:40:29.679 --> 00:40:32.182
and there was no towers, none of that was around.

1026
00:40:32.182 --> 00:40:34.450
So then I used an oscilloscope and I actually,

1027
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.887
we found it on the building's wires,

1028
00:40:35.887 --> 00:40:38.387
and we could find high frequencies.

1029
00:40:38.387 --> 00:40:40.422
Like a laptop computer, for example,

1030
00:40:40.422 --> 00:40:42.925
were 25 kilohertz back on the line,

1031
00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:45.462
some of them would put 12.5 depending on the brand.

1032
00:40:45.462 --> 00:40:46.362
<v Regina>Hmm hmm.</v>

1033
00:40:46.362 --> 00:40:47.564
<v ->The compact fluorescent lights,</v>

1034
00:40:47.564 --> 00:40:48.430
one of the most dangerous things

1035
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.365
that come out in this decade.

1036
00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:51.801
They put between 50 kilohertz

1037
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:53.737
and 100 kilohertz back on the line --

1038
00:40:53.737 --> 00:40:55.171
<v Regina>And almost everybody in an office</v>

1039
00:40:55.171 --> 00:40:57.040
or school setting is under these fluorescent lights.

1040
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.308
<v ->Any type of compact fluorescent light,</v>

1041
00:40:59.308 --> 00:41:01.877
and fluorescent lights sometimes get beat up

1042
00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:04.814
or a bad name, but they do, you know the tube type,

1043
00:41:04.814 --> 00:41:08.784
but we can take care of that problem,

1044
00:41:08.784 --> 00:41:10.319
but the compact fluorescent light,

1045
00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:11.987
you know the ones that look like a snake --

1046
00:41:11.987 --> 00:41:14.724
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->The one's the government's telling us to do.</v>

1047
00:41:14.724 --> 00:41:16.191
<v ->They put between 50 kilohertz</v>

1048
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:17.627
and 100 kilohertz back on the line,

1049
00:41:17.627 --> 00:41:18.660
and, of course, that's right in between

1050
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.831
that four and a hundred kilohertz,

1051
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:23.199
and then they also radiate through space,

1052
00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:26.302
so if you put it in, you can filter the base of it,

1053
00:41:26.302 --> 00:41:28.737
so it doesn't put it out, but on the line,

1054
00:41:28.737 --> 00:41:30.673
but it'll still come through space.

1055
00:41:30.673 --> 00:41:34.689
So these people, farmers, were complaining,

1056
00:41:35.644 --> 00:41:37.251
you know that these people would get ill.

1057
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:38.981
We found it on the village wires.

1058
00:41:38.981 --> 00:41:42.818
So, I went and I took a capacitor

1059
00:41:42.818 --> 00:41:45.754
and I bridged it across the line,

1060
00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:48.090
and a capacitor is a short to high frequency,

1061
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.592
so it shorted some of these high frequencies out,

1062
00:41:50.592 --> 00:41:53.428
and, of course, there was some changes

1063
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:55.197
in their health, and they improved,

1064
00:41:55.197 --> 00:41:58.435
and not always all of 'em, something,

1065
00:41:58.435 --> 00:42:01.404
but we knew we were on the right track.

1066
00:42:01.404 --> 00:42:03.172
So then we had to do a lot of research

1067
00:42:03.172 --> 00:42:05.808
and you can't go to your local doctor and find out,

1068
00:42:05.808 --> 00:42:06.945
and say, "What frequencies

1069
00:42:06.945 --> 00:42:08.347
"are the most dangerous frequencies?"

1070
00:42:08.347 --> 00:42:09.078
<v Regina>Right (laughs).</v>

1071
00:42:09.078 --> 00:42:11.113
<v ->Because either he doesn't know</v>

1072
00:42:11.113 --> 00:42:14.216
or he was working for the government

1073
00:42:14.216 --> 00:42:15.719
in some weapons program, or something

1074
00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:16.752
so he can't tell you.

1075
00:42:16.752 --> 00:42:18.487
So I had to go to the Soviet Union,

1076
00:42:18.487 --> 00:42:20.924
so I had to make several trips to Russia,

1077
00:42:20.924 --> 00:42:24.928
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and, of course,

1078
00:42:24.928 --> 00:42:26.328
there I can get this information,

1079
00:42:26.328 --> 00:42:27.663
because they did research --

1080
00:42:27.663 --> 00:42:29.432
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->More, better research on it.</v>

1081
00:42:29.432 --> 00:42:31.838
<v ->And so when we found out what the frequency range was</v>

1082
00:42:31.838 --> 00:42:34.537
then Professor Graham designed a filter

1083
00:42:34.537 --> 00:42:36.205
or capacitor, it's a capacitor,

1084
00:42:36.205 --> 00:42:38.574
but he designed a capacitor to take out

1085
00:42:38.574 --> 00:42:40.959
these frequencies in that range.

1086
00:42:41.777 --> 00:42:44.014
<v Regina>It's called the Stetzerizer.</v>

1087
00:42:44.014 --> 00:42:44.847
(Dave laughs)

1088
00:42:44.847 --> 00:42:45.615
That's your name!

1089
00:42:45.615 --> 00:42:46.049
<v ->Yes.</v>

1090
00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:47.045
<v Regina>Not the Grahamizer!</v>

1091
00:42:47.045 --> 00:42:48.117
How did that happen?

1092
00:42:50.085 --> 00:42:51.520
<v ->Grahams a popular name.</v>

1093
00:42:52.522 --> 00:42:53.456
You've heard of Quiznos,

1094
00:42:53.456 --> 00:42:54.991
the sub sandwich.
<v Regina>Yes,</v>

1095
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.759
It's my understanding that they had

1096
00:42:57.759 --> 00:42:59.628
a computer-generated name,
<v Regina>I see.</v>

1097
00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:00.662
and a couple picked Quiznos because

1098
00:43:00.662 --> 00:43:02.464
it wasn't like Johnson or Smith or --

1099
00:43:02.464 --> 00:43:02.946
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:43:02.946 --> 00:43:03.834
<v ->Or Anderson or something.</v>

1101
00:43:03.834 --> 00:43:07.170
So Stetzer is not a very popular name,

1102
00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:11.640
so what we did is we took
Stetzerizer and used it.

1103
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.943
<v Regina>And you two were --</v>

1104
00:43:12.943 --> 00:43:15.947
<v ->But Graham, if you notice it's a Graham Stetzer filter,
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1105
00:43:15.947 --> 00:43:16.746
the Graham Stetzer meter.

1106
00:43:16.746 --> 00:43:18.647
<v Regina>GS meter, yes. absolutely</v>
<v ->Graham's name is, yes GS units.</v>

1107
00:43:18.647 --> 00:43:20.374
<v ->Graham is always first, and he should be.</v>

1108
00:43:20.374 --> 00:43:21.250
(Regina laughs)

1109
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.887
<v Regina>And I wanna talk about, they're are two things.</v>

1110
00:43:24.887 --> 00:43:27.990
One of them I was reading in Donna's book,

1111
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:31.127
Donna's book, "Dirty Electricity," talking about

1112
00:43:31.127 --> 00:43:34.530
the health effects that happen in terms of the generation

1113
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.918
of dirty electricity after the 1973 oil embargo.

1114
00:43:39.734 --> 00:43:42.538
<v ->Yes, okay, what happened in 1972, we had an oil embargo.</v>

1115
00:43:42.538 --> 00:43:43.572
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1116
00:43:43.572 --> 00:43:45.508
<v ->And we had to get more energy efficient.</v>

1117
00:43:45.508 --> 00:43:47.142
So what we do, is we want to take,

1118
00:43:47.142 --> 00:43:49.712
like, for example, a light bulb, that has 60 watts,

1119
00:43:49.712 --> 00:43:51.181
an incandescent light bulb,

1120
00:43:51.181 --> 00:43:56.181
and it puts out so many lumens of power,

1121
00:43:56.284 --> 00:43:57.819
of light, candle power.

1122
00:43:57.819 --> 00:43:59.256
We measure it in candle power.

1123
00:43:59.256 --> 00:44:02.759
So now we wanna say, okay, let's take a bulb

1124
00:44:02.759 --> 00:44:05.327
and make is so that it only draws 30 watts,

1125
00:44:05.327 --> 00:44:07.029
but it still puts the same amount of power out,

1126
00:44:07.029 --> 00:44:10.399
or candle power, same amount of light.

1127
00:44:10.399 --> 00:44:12.301
So what we do is we chop up the sign wave.

1128
00:44:12.301 --> 00:44:15.337
Instead of using current the whole cycle,

1129
00:44:15.337 --> 00:44:18.276
the whole wave, what we do is we use current,

1130
00:44:18.276 --> 00:44:20.276
we turn it on, and we turn it off.

1131
00:44:20.276 --> 00:44:21.677
On, off.

1132
00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:23.679
And when we turn things on and off,

1133
00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:25.580
we get little sparks, like arching.

1134
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.416
<v Regina>Hmm hmm.</v>

1135
00:44:26.416 --> 00:44:27.951
<v ->And that's a high frequency event,</v>

1136
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:29.286
and it gets on the line

1137
00:44:29.286 --> 00:44:31.136
and it propagates over all long distances.

1138
00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:35.057
<v Regina>So, a different, an increase</v>

1139
00:44:35.057 --> 00:44:37.259
of a different set of health symptoms

1140
00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:41.797
started coming up then, after 1973, as I understand it.

1141
00:44:41.797 --> 00:44:45.367
<v ->Yes, if you read like Dr. Robert O. Becker,</v>

1142
00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:47.503
who was twice nominated for a Nobel Prize,

1143
00:44:47.503 --> 00:44:51.540
he said in 1980s that we are now being exposed

1144
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.243
to frequencies we've never been exposed to before.

1145
00:44:54.243 --> 00:44:57.515
It is the cause of the made up diseases of the 80s,

1146
00:44:57.515 --> 00:45:00.817
and he listed chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia,

1147
00:45:00.817 --> 00:45:03.886
ADD, ADHD in kids.

1148
00:45:03.886 --> 00:45:05.654
When I went to school, we didn't have anybody

1149
00:45:05.654 --> 00:45:08.924
in our class that ADD or ADHD.
<v Regina>No.</v>

1150
00:45:08.924 --> 00:45:11.194
<v Regina>You had a few kids that had ants in their pants.</v>

1151
00:45:11.194 --> 00:45:12.161
(laughter)

1152
00:45:12.161 --> 00:45:14.330
<v ->That's true we did, yeah!
<v Regina>That was about it.</v>

1153
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.332
But you know, and even the F-students,

1154
00:45:16.332 --> 00:45:18.000
you know, could take car apart at night

1155
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.369
and put it together in their sleep

1156
00:45:19.369 --> 00:45:21.570
and read micrometers and feeler gauges

1157
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.108
and things like that, so, but we didn't have that then.

1158
00:45:25.108 --> 00:45:28.310
But since 1972, when we started using current differently

1159
00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.280
we became exposed to a whole different set of frequencies,

1160
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.849
and in 1992, was the year of the Pentium,

1161
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:36.519
you know the Pentium computer,

1162
00:45:36.519 --> 00:45:38.354
now then everybody could really basically

1163
00:45:38.354 --> 00:45:41.090
afford a home computer, and so

1164
00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.058
there weren't many houses after that,

1165
00:45:43.058 --> 00:45:44.926
that didn't have a computer in,

1166
00:45:44.926 --> 00:45:46.873
and so we're now exposing ourselves

1167
00:45:46.873 --> 00:45:48.033
to all these frequencies.

1168
00:45:48.033 --> 00:45:50.332
Now if you take the symptoms of chronic fatigue,

1169
00:45:50.332 --> 00:45:55.332
fibromyalgia, ADD, ADHD, and you look at them,

1170
00:45:55.437 --> 00:45:57.673
and you say, okay, there's no known cause or cure,

1171
00:45:57.673 --> 00:46:00.343
but if you look at symptoms of radio wave sickness,

1172
00:46:00.343 --> 00:46:03.512
which has been around for many decades

1173
00:46:03.512 --> 00:46:05.914
they overlap, they're the same thing.

1174
00:46:05.914 --> 00:46:07.650
So if that's the case,

1175
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.718
if you can take this high frequency away

1176
00:46:09.718 --> 00:46:12.154
because the cure for radio wave sickness

1177
00:46:12.154 --> 00:46:13.924
is to remove yourself from those frequencies

1178
00:46:13.924 --> 00:46:16.291
or remove the frequencies from you,

1179
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:19.261
so if we remove those frequencies from your environment

1180
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:21.097
then you should get better,

1181
00:46:21.097 --> 00:46:22.731
and there's been all kinds of published,

1182
00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:24.600
peer-reviewed research where we've done this

1183
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.669
in blind and double-blind studies

1184
00:46:26.669 --> 00:46:28.905
and the results are statistically significant

1185
00:46:28.905 --> 00:46:31.492
and it's been published in peer-reviewed medical journals.

1186
00:46:33.242 --> 00:46:36.978
<v Regina>Another area that is, I'm very interested in,</v>

1187
00:46:36.978 --> 00:46:40.218
it has to do with the metals in the body,

1188
00:46:40.218 --> 00:46:43.485
mercury and other things that are filtrating out

1189
00:46:43.485 --> 00:46:46.088
and into the tissues of the body,

1190
00:46:46.088 --> 00:46:50.425
and their interface with electricity or dirty electricity

1191
00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:51.927
and electromagnetic fields.

1192
00:46:51.927 --> 00:46:56.927
What does that cocktail of events mean to the human body?

1193
00:46:57.333 --> 00:46:58.934
How does it work together?

1194
00:46:58.934 --> 00:47:01.037
Having, and even then mercury in these

1195
00:47:01.604 --> 00:47:03.906
compact fluorescents and such.

1196
00:47:03.906 --> 00:47:05.690
How's this all work together?

1197
00:47:05.808 --> 00:47:09.378
<v ->Well, it's a little bit out of my area of expertise.</v>

1198
00:47:09.378 --> 00:47:10.413
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:47:10.413 --> 00:47:13.786
<v ->But, we do know through research</v>

1200
00:47:13.786 --> 00:47:16.719
and if you look at the symptoms of radio wave sickness,

1201
00:47:16.719 --> 00:47:19.421
or in other words, exposure to high frequency,

1202
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:22.963
it causes a redistribution in the metals in the body,

1203
00:47:22.963 --> 00:47:26.395
or the breakdown of the metals in your body.

1204
00:47:26.395 --> 00:47:27.596
<v Regina>So that means,</v>
<v ->You know the amalgam fillings</v>

1205
00:47:27.596 --> 00:47:28.697
Yeah!

1206
00:47:28.697 --> 00:47:29.831
<v ->You might have to have 'em replaced more often,</v>

1207
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:31.066
because they go bad.

1208
00:47:31.066 --> 00:47:32.567
<v Regina>Does that also mean they're gonna leach</v>

1209
00:47:32.567 --> 00:47:34.036
and become more toxic as it moves around.

1210
00:47:34.036 --> 00:47:36.246
<v ->Well that would be my assumption, yes.</v>

1211
00:47:36.326 --> 00:47:41.326
<v Regina>So the electrification of the world</v>

1212
00:47:42.146 --> 00:47:45.782
combined with quote, modern dentistry, unquote,

1213
00:47:45.782 --> 00:47:50.782
that uses amalgam and toxic metals in the mouth, together,

1214
00:47:50.953 --> 00:47:54.489
could have a devastating impact on human health.

1215
00:47:54.489 --> 00:47:57.342
<v ->That's very likely.</v>

1216
00:47:57.526 --> 00:47:59.027
I'm not credentialed in the area

1217
00:47:59.027 --> 00:48:00.262
of human health.
<v Regina>Yeah, I know.</v>

1218
00:48:00.262 --> 00:48:01.697
<v Regina>I'm just asking you --</v>

1219
00:48:01.697 --> 00:48:04.904
<v ->What I can do, what I do know
<v Regina>Conceptual terms</v>

1220
00:48:04.904 --> 00:48:06.568
is that if you're exposed to high frequencies

1221
00:48:06.568 --> 00:48:09.404
it will cause a redistribution or a breakdown

1222
00:48:09.404 --> 00:48:10.605
in the metals in your body,

1223
00:48:10.605 --> 00:48:12.812
and, of course, we have vaccines

1224
00:48:12.812 --> 00:48:14.243
that we're giving our kids,
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1225
00:48:14.243 --> 00:48:16.178
that we didn't used to get when I was going to school.

1226
00:48:16.178 --> 00:48:17.246
<v Regina>Important.</v>

1227
00:48:17.246 --> 00:48:19.715
<v ->And things like that, that have mercury in 'em.</v>

1228
00:48:19.715 --> 00:48:21.117
I mean so we have metals in our body,
<v Regina>Important to hear.</v>

1229
00:48:21.117 --> 00:48:22.785
that we normally didn't have

1230
00:48:22.785 --> 00:48:25.121
when I came through school
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1231
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:25.787
and growing up.

1232
00:48:25.787 --> 00:48:27.223
<v Regina>And we're seeing the instance of autism,</v>

1233
00:48:27.223 --> 00:48:29.859
leukemia, everything, skyrocketing
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

1234
00:48:29.859 --> 00:48:31.330
in the last few decades.

1235
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.762
There's another one that I woke up,

1236
00:48:33.762 --> 00:48:35.296
I knew I was going to be seeing you today,

1237
00:48:35.296 --> 00:48:37.132
I woke up this morning and I thought,

1238
00:48:37.132 --> 00:48:41.538
uh oh. we have a hybrid car, a Prius.

1239
00:48:41.538 --> 00:48:44.473
We love our Prius, I mean it's just so well-engineered.

1240
00:48:44.473 --> 00:48:46.942
We get 47 miles a gallon and we travel

1241
00:48:46.942 --> 00:48:49.581
to these interviews by car, almost always,

1242
00:48:49.581 --> 00:48:51.613
thousands of miles.

1243
00:48:51.613 --> 00:48:52.981
What's happening?

1244
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:55.917
<v ->Well I'm a instrument man.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:48:55.917 --> 00:48:56.986
I only believe my meters,

1246
00:48:56.986 --> 00:49:00.855
and you should by a Gauss meter and you can put it

1247
00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:03.509
on the seat and see what your being exposed to.

1248
00:49:05.661 --> 00:49:07.963
<v Regina>It's gonna be an unpleasant surprise, I assume.</v>

1249
00:49:07.963 --> 00:49:10.785
<v ->You probably won't want to drive your Prius after that.</v>

1250
00:49:12.634 --> 00:49:13.620
<v Regina>Ouch!</v>

1251
00:49:14.702 --> 00:49:16.812
And is that in the front seat and back seat?

1252
00:49:16.812 --> 00:49:18.173
<v ->Oh put it where you're at.</v>

1253
00:49:18.173 --> 00:49:19.207
I mean you can move it around.
<v Regina>Yeah, put it where your at.</v>

1254
00:49:19.207 --> 00:49:20.442
But you know, put it right on the seat.

1255
00:49:20.442 --> 00:49:21.911
<v Regina>Well we ordered one of these meters,</v>

1256
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:23.412
so we're gonna be able to find out pretty soon.

1257
00:49:23.412 --> 00:49:25.315
<v ->You'll need a Gauss meter.</v>

1258
00:49:25.315 --> 00:49:26.816
<v Regina>Oh a Gauss meter!</v>
<v ->Its a different type of meter.</v>

1259
00:49:26.816 --> 00:49:28.550
<v ->Something measuring through space.</v>

1260
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.620
Our meter measures something that's on the wires.

1261
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.422
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1262
00:49:32.422 --> 00:49:33.088
<v ->You have to plug it in,</v>

1263
00:49:33.088 --> 00:49:34.022
and actually come in contact with it.

1264
00:49:34.022 --> 00:49:34.689
<v Regina>So we need a Gauss meter</v>

1265
00:49:34.689 --> 00:49:36.425
to find out what's going on.
<v ->You can buy a Gauss meter like maybe $200.</v>

1266
00:49:36.425 --> 00:49:38.360
<v ->You can get a pretty decent one,</v>

1267
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.562
and you can set it on the seat,

1268
00:49:40.562 --> 00:49:43.714
and then you can make your own determination.

1269
00:49:43.999 --> 00:49:45.367
<v Regina>So this is perhaps the downside</v>

1270
00:49:45.367 --> 00:49:46.504
of these technologies

1271
00:49:46.504 --> 00:49:48.336
and not understanding the full implication.

1272
00:49:48.336 --> 00:49:50.305
<v ->GM was one of the last car companies</v>

1273
00:49:50.305 --> 00:49:52.174
to come out with a hybrid,

1274
00:49:52.174 --> 00:49:52.974
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:49:52.974 --> 00:49:54.109
<v ->And one of the reasons was,</v>

1276
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:57.028
they were working very hard on their shielding.

1277
00:49:57.145 --> 00:49:58.680
<v Regina>Is there any way one should have one,</v>

1278
00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.790
you can shield yourself?

1279
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.450
Is there any kind of barrier you can put between yourself?

1280
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.219
<v ->I haven't done a lot of research with that.</v>

1281
00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:04.989
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.689
These are all self-serving questions now.

1283
00:50:07.689 --> 00:50:10.793
<v ->I worked with some shielding companies.</v>

1284
00:50:10.793 --> 00:50:13.562
There's all kinds of material coming out now,

1285
00:50:13.562 --> 00:50:15.298
you know, newer, now that we've known it,

1286
00:50:15.298 --> 00:50:17.632
like Israel, for example, has rules,

1287
00:50:17.632 --> 00:50:20.505
and very strict rules about EMS,

1288
00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:23.672
and so there's a company there, that makes,

1289
00:50:23.672 --> 00:50:25.508
you've heard of mule metal, maybe,

1290
00:50:25.508 --> 00:50:27.177
or some of your audience has,

1291
00:50:27.177 --> 00:50:28.043
and things like that.

1292
00:50:28.043 --> 00:50:30.311
Well that's very expensive so there's probably

1293
00:50:30.311 --> 00:50:33.115
some things like that, that could be available

1294
00:50:33.115 --> 00:50:34.082
or could be adapted.

1295
00:50:34.082 --> 00:50:35.617
I'm not sure.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

1296
00:50:35.617 --> 00:50:36.485
<v Regina>Well that's for us</v>

1297
00:50:36.485 --> 00:50:38.887
and our other hybrid driving viewers

1298
00:50:38.887 --> 00:50:40.056
watching this, right now.

1299
00:50:40.056 --> 00:50:42.858
In terms of our homes, really, it's quite,

1300
00:50:42.858 --> 00:50:44.960
it sounds like it's quite doable,

1301
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.662
affordable and accessible for the average person

1302
00:50:47.662 --> 00:50:52.501
to look at blocking, or how would you technically

1303
00:50:52.501 --> 00:50:55.571
refer to it, those frequencies in their home.

1304
00:50:55.571 --> 00:50:57.072
<v ->Well you eliminate or short them out.</v>

1305
00:50:57.072 --> 00:50:58.173
<v Regina>Yeah, you short 'em out, okay.</v>

1306
00:50:58.173 --> 00:51:01.977
<v ->It is, and you're taking control of your own environment.</v>

1307
00:51:01.977 --> 00:51:02.644
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:51:02.644 --> 00:51:04.112
<v ->It's something you can do.</v>

1309
00:51:04.112 --> 00:51:08.216
In reality, when Mike O'Dell makes a computer,

1310
00:51:08.216 --> 00:51:10.452
and he knows it's putting, you know, a certain

1311
00:51:10.452 --> 00:51:12.221
amount of kilohertz back on the line,

1312
00:51:12.221 --> 00:51:14.290
he can make a tune filter for that,

1313
00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:16.057
and put it in but they said it would add about

1314
00:51:16.057 --> 00:51:17.960
five dollars to the cost of the computer,

1315
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.294
so they don't wanna do it.

1316
00:51:19.294 --> 00:51:20.096
<v Regina>Five dollars.</v>

1317
00:51:20.096 --> 00:51:20.630
<v ->Yes.</v>

1318
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.764
Actually, we've bought components

1319
00:51:21.764 --> 00:51:23.198
for about less than 50 cents.

1320
00:51:23.198 --> 00:51:24.533
<v Regina>Five dollars to the price</v>

1321
00:51:24.533 --> 00:51:25.801
of a several hundred dollar item.

1322
00:51:25.801 --> 00:51:28.170
<v ->So when Sony makes their TVs and things,</v>

1323
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.773
they can actually put a tune filter in there

1324
00:51:30.773 --> 00:51:32.140
because they know what frequency's

1325
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.175
going back on the line.

1326
00:51:33.175 --> 00:51:34.143
It's measurable.

1327
00:51:34.143 --> 00:51:35.981
<v Regina>Are companies going to start taking this on?</v>

1328
00:51:35.981 --> 00:51:37.512
<v ->I don't think so for a while,</v>

1329
00:51:38.614 --> 00:51:39.948
because nobody's going to mandate it

1330
00:51:39.948 --> 00:51:41.482
or make them do it.

1331
00:51:41.482 --> 00:51:45.921
But, so in the mean time, okay, we have this solution

1332
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:47.628
that you can plug these filters in,

1333
00:51:47.628 --> 00:51:48.725
and it'll take care of it.

1334
00:51:48.725 --> 00:51:51.061
I mean, I'm not gonna, and if they came out tomorrow

1335
00:51:51.061 --> 00:51:53.530
and said, okay, we mandate this, you have to do that,

1336
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.901
I still have my TV, I'm not gonna throw my TV out

1337
00:51:55.901 --> 00:51:57.766
the window to go buy this other thing.

1338
00:51:57.766 --> 00:51:58.767
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1339
00:51:58.767 --> 00:52:02.404
<v ->So I guess the questions is, "Can we live in this world?</v>

1340
00:52:02.404 --> 00:52:04.206
"Can we use our electronic equipment

1341
00:52:04.206 --> 00:52:05.240
"and can we use it safer?"

1342
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.475
And the answer is yes.

1343
00:52:06.475 --> 00:52:08.142
<v Regina>And that's the good news in all of this.</v>

1344
00:52:08.142 --> 00:52:10.279
<v ->Yes, this is not doom and gloom.</v>

1345
00:52:10.279 --> 00:52:13.748
In EMFs, everything you picked up

1346
00:52:13.748 --> 00:52:15.885
until Graham and I came on the scene,

1347
00:52:15.885 --> 00:52:18.791
everything you picked up, it was the dangers of EMFs,

1348
00:52:18.791 --> 00:52:20.989
doom and gloom, doom and gloom, you know.

1349
00:52:20.989 --> 00:52:23.392
You gotta be aware of it, you this is causing this problem,

1350
00:52:23.392 --> 00:52:25.326
but nobody offered a solution.

1351
00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:27.463
Martin Graham is a Professor Emeritus

1352
00:52:27.463 --> 00:52:30.065
from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering.

1353
00:52:30.065 --> 00:52:31.467
He's a problem solver.

1354
00:52:31.467 --> 00:52:33.635
You know, good engineers are problem solvers,

1355
00:52:33.635 --> 00:52:35.838
so now we've identified the problem,

1356
00:52:35.838 --> 00:52:37.438
and we've come up with a solution,

1357
00:52:37.438 --> 00:52:38.740
and the solution works.

1358
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.510
It's been tested by Professor Magda Havas

1359
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.912
from Trent University in Canada,

1360
00:52:43.912 --> 00:52:46.348
and we'll put a link to her if you want to.

1361
00:52:46.348 --> 00:52:48.583
She's done several studies.

1362
00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:51.621
Professor Stephen Genesis from the University of Calgary,

1363
00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:56.621
Professor Sam Milham, Doctor of Medicine,

1364
00:52:57.124 --> 00:53:01.930
they've all done research, using our filters

1365
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.966
and our meter and the results

1366
00:53:03.966 --> 00:53:06.017
are all statistically significant and they've

1367
00:53:06.017 --> 00:53:08.755
been published in peer-reviewed medical journals

1368
00:53:08.755 --> 00:53:12.424
so it's not junk science.

1369
00:53:12.942 --> 00:53:14.176
<v Regina>Thank you for your contribution</v>

1370
00:53:14.176 --> 00:53:15.512
in that, and not only that, again,

1371
00:53:15.512 --> 00:53:18.213
I mean all of this stuff has been made super-affordable.

1372
00:53:18.213 --> 00:53:19.714
I'm not a sales person for your guys,

1373
00:53:19.714 --> 00:53:21.617
but I was very impressed when I found out

1374
00:53:21.617 --> 00:53:25.260
all this stuff's like, what, $35 or something, in US.

1375
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.154
<v ->Yes.</v>

1376
00:53:26.154 --> 00:53:27.356
<v Regina>I think something like that for a filter --</v>

1377
00:53:27.356 --> 00:53:29.057
<v ->The filter sells for $35 and the meter</v>

1378
00:53:29.057 --> 00:53:31.193
is like $125 or something.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1379
00:53:31.193 --> 00:53:33.202
So it's like a oscilloscope's $5,000.

1380
00:53:33.202 --> 00:53:34.276
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1381
00:53:34.276 --> 00:53:35.797
<v ->And now you can have a $125 meter,</v>

1382
00:53:35.797 --> 00:53:37.833
and plug it in and you can see what's in your home.

1383
00:53:37.833 --> 00:53:40.538
<v Regina>So that's why I wanted to talk to you guys.</v>

1384
00:53:40.538 --> 00:53:42.804
Sometimes, you're right, doom and gloom.

1385
00:53:42.804 --> 00:53:47.308
No point in having the bejesus scared out of everyone

1386
00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:48.876
when there's nothing you can do about it,

1387
00:53:48.876 --> 00:53:50.745
but that we can do something about it

1388
00:53:50.745 --> 00:53:52.848
which is why I wanted to talk to both of you.

1389
00:53:52.848 --> 00:53:54.550
<v ->Yes, and the results are measurable.</v>

1390
00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.018
It isn't like something that's left

1391
00:53:57.018 --> 00:53:59.191
to faith or something like that.

1392
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:00.455
The results are measurable,

1393
00:54:00.455 --> 00:54:02.324
and you can go down to the electronics store

1394
00:54:02.324 --> 00:54:04.059
and buy a $5,000 oscilloscope

1395
00:54:04.059 --> 00:54:05.929
and you could actually see the wave form

1396
00:54:05.929 --> 00:54:07.563
and can see it change, you can see

1397
00:54:07.563 --> 00:54:09.998
the high frequencies go away, or you can buy that meter

1398
00:54:09.998 --> 00:54:12.000
and you get a digital number and it's changing too.

1399
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.069
<v Regina>So anyone who works maybe in a University</v>

1400
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:17.472
(laughs) or in an electrical department somewhere

1401
00:54:17.472 --> 00:54:19.474
can maybe just borrow it overnight.

1402
00:54:19.474 --> 00:54:20.943
The rest of us could pay $100
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1403
00:54:20.943 --> 00:54:21.877
and buy one of the --

1404
00:54:21.877 --> 00:54:24.012
<v ->TV repairmen, you could borrow one from them.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1405
00:54:24.012 --> 00:54:25.280
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

1406
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.482
If you've got a TV repairman in the family,

1407
00:54:26.482 --> 00:54:27.425
you've saved a $100,

1408
00:54:27.425 --> 00:54:29.251
otherwise you can do somethin' about it.

1409
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:30.819
Well any final thoughts Dave?

1410
00:54:30.819 --> 00:54:32.120
Anything that we need to know about,

1411
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.288
I haven't talked to you about?

1412
00:54:33.288 --> 00:54:34.805
<v ->No I think you covered it very well.</v>

1413
00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:36.059
<v Regina>Thank you so much for your time,</v>

1414
00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:38.160
and more so, for the work you've done

1415
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.261
to help protect the rest of us.

1416
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:41.162
Really appreciate it.

1417
00:54:41.162 --> 00:54:42.864
I'm sorry to hear that about the hybrid car though.

1418
00:54:42.864 --> 00:54:43.699
That breaks my heart.

1419
00:54:43.699 --> 00:54:45.217
(Dave laughs)

1420
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:49.071
Please take the time to read her book,

1421
00:54:49.071 --> 00:54:50.905
"Dirty Electricity" or another one of her works,

1422
00:54:50.905 --> 00:54:52.874
"Silent Fields," which you can purchase

1423
00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:55.714
at her website, silentfields.com.

1424
00:54:55.714 --> 00:54:58.447
This is very important for all of us to understand.

1425
00:54:58.447 --> 00:54:59.748
Scott and I've been trying to get rid

1426
00:54:59.748 --> 00:55:01.716
of the dirty electricity from our environment

1427
00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:02.784
for a while now.

1428
00:55:02.784 --> 00:55:05.553
We've used detection devices and some filters.

1429
00:55:05.553 --> 00:55:07.656
Some of what we found was downright scary,

1430
00:55:07.656 --> 00:55:09.824
especially the dirty electricity coming off

1431
00:55:09.824 --> 00:55:11.560
of my computer keyboard.

1432
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.927
Check it out for yourselves.

1433
00:55:12.927 --> 00:55:15.997
At least we now have devices that are affordable and work!

1434
00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:19.634
You can find those at Stetzerizer.us.com.

1435
00:55:19.634 --> 00:55:20.702
Until next time.

1436
00:55:20.702 --> 00:55:21.820
Thanks for watching CMN.

1437
00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.240
