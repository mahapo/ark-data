00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.590
(ambient music)

2
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.249
I simply love physicists.

3
00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.189
Mostly because they have the capability of

4
00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.009
wrapping their minds around the unseen.

5
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.409
For this very reason, they've been the arm of science

6
00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.649
that has been most successful in explaining phenomena

7
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.669
that until now has been relegated to giggles.

8
00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.809
The most intriguing subject is that of a force

9
00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.169
that has been called by many names, including

10
00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:39.209
"chi" in the Asian healing arts and martial arts vocabulary.

11
00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:41.789
It's a ubiquitous field that permeates all things

12
00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.889
and affects all other systems,

13
00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:45.769
but is very difficult to measure.

14
00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.989
This is why it makes scientists so edgy

15
00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.729
to enter into this field.

16
00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.929
Claude Swanson, who is a physicist from MIT and Princeton,

17
00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.690
has embraced these challenges,

18
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.709
and has written two amazing books:

19
00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:57.949
"The Synchronized Universe"

20
00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.229
and "Life Force: The Scientific Basis,"

21
00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.989
in which he explains how this field interfaces with ESP,

22
00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.889
remote viewing and remote healing, the flexibility

23
00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.739
of time space continuum, and more.

24
00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.989
Claude, last time I saw you we were having a wild good time.

25
00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:19.029
I don't know where we went, it was up some little roads

26
00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:21.429
outside of Boulder with Harry Oldfield

27
00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.089
and his PIP technology,

28
00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:26.689
into a strange energetic inside a house,

29
00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.809
and that's the last time I saw you.

30
00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:32.429
And that story - we'll just let it be that for now.

31
00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.529
But you have continued your studies in the scientific realm

32
00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.310
of that very kind of energy we were looking for

33
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.829
in the house with Harry Oldfield and his technology,

34
00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.189
his camera that day.

35
00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.089
And what I'm finding so fascinating is

36
00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:48.630
in your lecture today, you were speaking

37
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.609
about something called torsion, and about technologies

38
00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.049
that have been developed in secret

39
00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.229
in Russia for a long time,

40
00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.609
and have started leaking out from behind

41
00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.109
what was The Iron Curtain.

42
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.249
But they're bringing forward some magnificent

43
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.149
understandings of the subtle field that we call - what?

44
00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.109
What are all the names for the subtle field?

45
00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.469
<v ->Well, the Hindus call it prana,</v>

46
00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.169
the Chinese call it chi,

47
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.930
Ã‰lan Vital, some of the French call it,

48
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.789
vril, some of the Hindus have called it.

49
00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:23.169
It's had lots and lots of names.

50
00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.669
<v ->So we get the idea we're talking about that subtle</v>

51
00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.210
je ne sais quois, right?

52
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.789
<v ->And orgones is what Reich called it,</v>

53
00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.099
it's the same stuff.

54
00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.109
<v ->So we're talking about a subtle field that is</v>

55
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.529
very hard to actually measure,

56
00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.009
but affects and interacts with every other phenomena known.

57
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.409
<v ->Including consciousness.</v>

58
00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.291
<v ->Because we only have about a half an hour</v>

59
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.491
in this conversation,

60
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:48.991
I thought we might launch into

61
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:50.911
some of the discoveries out of Russia

62
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:55.531
that are talking about this left hand torsion

63
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:58.871
and the effects of it on our psychic consciousness.

64
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:01.991
So let's talk about what left hand torsion is,

65
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.151
and what this is you're talking about in general.

66
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.932
<v ->Well, it goes back to the early 1950's.</v>

67
00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:11.751
An astrophysicist named Nicholai Kozyrev in Russia

68
00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.771
who was looking at double star systems:

69
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:15.971
one star orbiting the other.

70
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.331
And he noticed that the stars, even though they

71
00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.452
start out different, they become like each other

72
00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:28.452
much faster than they should by our current Western physics.

73
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:30.331
And he realized there was something else

74
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.171
interacting between them,

75
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.631
that they were exchanging an energy,

76
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:36.071
the one burning fast was sending something

77
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:37.391
to the one burning slow,

78
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.411
so they would become more like each other.

79
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:41.112
<v ->So they could sustain companionship.</v>

80
00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:44.731
<v ->Well he actually called it... the wonderful book</v>

81
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.691
Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain,

82
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.001
by Ostrander and Schroeder, a real classic

83
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.591
everybody should read it,

84
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.071
were interviewing him, in 1969 or thereabouts,

85
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:57.171
and he is describing this, and he says:

86
00:03:57.171 --> 00:04:01.091
"It's as though they were communing by telepathy,"

87
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.611
and he kinda says this with a smile,

88
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:05.871
and the reason he was smiling is because

89
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.011
the Russians, I think, have discovered that

90
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:10.691
this is the force, as you call it torsion,

91
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.671
that is responsible for telepathy.

92
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:17.071
So it is a force that extends over distance.

93
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.391
We don't measure it by electromagnetic means,

94
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:22.871
so it doesn't show up in our conventional ways,

95
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.551
but it's very important for psychic processes

96
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:27.391
and for some physical processes,

97
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:29.031
so that's how it got discovered.

98
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:31.806
<v ->But it does have...</v>

99
00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:35.606
there is a magnetic component to this story as well,

100
00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.606
when you start getting into magnetism,

101
00:04:37.606 --> 00:04:39.866
north and south poles, polarities.

102
00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:41.666
Can you talk about that a little bit?

103
00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:43.266
All the way up to geographically

104
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.466
what happens with our awareness?

105
00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:49.146
<v ->The north pole of a magnet produces</v>

106
00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:50.746
one pole of this energy.

107
00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:53.926
Torsion comes in two poles: left-handed and right-handed.

108
00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:57.186
One tends to speed things up, one tends to slow things down.

109
00:04:57.186 --> 00:05:01.046
They have a variety of different properties...

110
00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:02.474
What I did in my work is

111
00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:06.734
go back to the German researcher Reichenbach,

112
00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:11.714
in the 1840's and 50's, who also studied the same force,

113
00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:13.814
he had different names for it of course,

114
00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.994
but he found that the north pole of a magnet

115
00:05:16.994 --> 00:05:20.714
produces what some sensitive people are able to see

116
00:05:20.714 --> 00:05:23.134
with their eyes in the dark.

117
00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:28.134
It's a bluish light, he called it negative ode,

118
00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:30.855
and the other end, the south pole of the magnet

119
00:05:30.855 --> 00:05:33.954
produced a reddish light which he called positive ode.

120
00:05:33.954 --> 00:05:37.374
Turns out that the positive ode is the same as

121
00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.434
left handed torsion in the Russian nomenclature,

122
00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:44.115
and the bluish is the right handed torsion.

123
00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:48.354
So, the work really mirrors the Russian work

124
00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:50.674
and gives you much more confidence

125
00:05:50.674 --> 00:05:53.214
about trusting that it's real.

126
00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:56.214
<v ->And it has very practical implications.</v>

127
00:05:56.214 --> 00:05:59.355
For example, you were mentioning that

128
00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:03.915
when we go to the north pole, there is a tendency

129
00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:06.754
to have an opening of our psychic awareness.

130
00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:11.074
<v ->This energy is produced by various things,</v>

131
00:06:11.074 --> 00:06:14.194
including spinning objects, so that if you're

132
00:06:14.194 --> 00:06:16.754
at the north pole of our earth, looking down,

133
00:06:16.754 --> 00:06:20.974
there's a left handed torsion field

134
00:06:20.974 --> 00:06:22.514
produced by the earth's spinning

135
00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:25.254
that enhances our psychic ability.

136
00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:28.915
But Reichenbach did not look much into that,

137
00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:30.494
but Kozyrev did.

138
00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:32.975
And so if you read that Psychic Discoveries book,

139
00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:36.994
he talks to the interviewers about the effects

140
00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:38.615
at different times of the year

141
00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:41.394
with growing plants, with what happens

142
00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:44.234
in north pole versus south pole,

143
00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:49.234
and basically, by the time they were interviewing him,

144
00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:53.094
the Russians already knew how to use this torsion force

145
00:06:53.094 --> 00:06:55.594
to enhance psychic ability.

146
00:06:55.594 --> 00:06:57.194
And he actually says that, so.

147
00:06:57.194 --> 00:06:58.934
<v ->That's pretty incredible, because of course that's</v>

148
00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:01.334
not anything that's been emerging out of the American

149
00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:04.794
or European bodies of sciences, even at this time.

150
00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:06.555
So they were way ahead of the game.

151
00:07:06.555 --> 00:07:08.155
And I mean, having mucked around in this field

152
00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:09.494
for a couple decades,

153
00:07:09.494 --> 00:07:12.214
I was doing interviews with what was going on then,

154
00:07:12.214 --> 00:07:14.235
some experiments with Russel Targ, for example,

155
00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:17.314
behind The Iron Curtain back then, with remote viewing,

156
00:07:17.314 --> 00:07:19.814
which is something that you have personal experience with

157
00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.254
as well, and I want to talk about that in a minute.

158
00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:24.954
Just going back for a moment to the magnets,

159
00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:28.394
You were also saying that you can place the north end

160
00:07:28.394 --> 00:07:31.634
of a magnet in the area we casually call the third eye

161
00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:34.494
that has a lot of glandular function behind it, right?

162
00:07:34.494 --> 00:07:36.354
And?

163
00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:41.214
<v ->Well, what Kozyrev says is that the left handed torsion</v>

164
00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:45.394
enhances psychic ability, and the south pole of a magnet

165
00:07:45.394 --> 00:07:48.075
has the left handed torsion.

166
00:07:48.075 --> 00:07:51.615
There are American magnet healing researchers

167
00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:53.994
like Davison Ralls, who have written several books

168
00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:55.634
about magnetic healing,

169
00:07:55.634 --> 00:07:57.935
and they've tried the same experiment independently,

170
00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.594
and they find that the south pole of a magnet does

171
00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:02.514
enhance psychic ability.

172
00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:05.554
So we have some confirmation of Kozyrev's claim.

173
00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:08.335
I have not tried it, but you have to do some careful

174
00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:10.814
experiments, but they say only ten minutes or so

175
00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:13.194
with a magnet on your third eye will help.

176
00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:16.044
<v ->Interesting. And again, tell people which pole again.</v>

177
00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:22.370
<v ->This question caused me quite a bit of pain,</v>

178
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.270
writing the book, because I discovered that

179
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.150
the magnetic healers had a different terminology

180
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.270
than the Russians and most physicists do,

181
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.169
so basically, the way to find out is to take a magnet

182
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.130
with a bar magnet with one pole north, one pole south,

183
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:43.130
put it on a string, see which way turns toward the north.

184
00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.949
Compass needles, for example,

185
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:48.210
are designed so that one end turns toward the north.

186
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.030
However, it turns out that in the arctic,

187
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.530
where our geographic north pole is,

188
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.510
there's actually a magnetic south pole.

189
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.070
So the one that points in that direction

190
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.470
in your little magnet will be the north pole of the magnet.

191
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.810
So that's important, because the magnetic healers

192
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.960
have a convention that's completely opposite.

193
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.648
<v ->That's important to know.</v>

194
00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:15.908
We're talking about this through a different lens.

195
00:09:15.908 --> 00:09:18.688
And you also talked about the fact that this same kind

196
00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:23.688
of blush light can be seen by sensitives, by some people,

197
00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:27.908
and also coming out the tip of a crystal.

198
00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:29.508
<v ->Right.</v>

199
00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:31.538
<v ->What would that mean...</v>

200
00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:34.388
if you have a crystal in your possession,

201
00:09:34.388 --> 00:09:37.888
if you were to point the tip of the crystal

202
00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:41.268
in this third eye area, by association, is that correct,

203
00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:43.688
or could that have some kind of potential?

204
00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:45.438
<v ->It could be. That makes complete sense.</v>

205
00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:48.128
Basically, a crystal has two ends, like you say.

206
00:09:48.128 --> 00:09:51.288
Normally the one that grows that's in contact

207
00:09:51.288 --> 00:09:53.308
with the earth, growing out of the earth,

208
00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:57.328
has the south pole energy, has the reddish energy

209
00:09:57.328 --> 00:09:59.068
as perceived by sensitives.

210
00:09:59.068 --> 00:10:00.288
And so that should be that one

211
00:10:00.288 --> 00:10:02.688
that would enhance psychic ability.

212
00:10:02.688 --> 00:10:07.488
The question of how strong they are, how big they are,

213
00:10:07.488 --> 00:10:10.448
I haven't seen anybody talking about doing that,

214
00:10:10.448 --> 00:10:12.328
but theoretically... that makes total sense.

215
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:14.248
<v ->I was putting some pieces together</v>

216
00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:15.377
while you were talking, and theoretically

217
00:10:15.377 --> 00:10:16.708
it made sense to me too.

218
00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:18.868
We'll go back to remote viewing now, because

219
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:22.088
when you're talking about this left hand torsion,

220
00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:26.308
we're talking about also cosmic effects,

221
00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:28.968
and we're talking about, as you said earlier,

222
00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:33.488
looking at astrology from a sidereal standpoint.

223
00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:36.008
We're looking at the effect of certain

224
00:10:36.008 --> 00:10:37.868
positions of the stars.

225
00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:40.048
And you talked about Virgo.

226
00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:42.548
Encapsulate what you were saying about that.

227
00:10:42.548 --> 00:10:46.128
<v ->A statistician named James Spoteswood,</v>

228
00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:49.828
10 or 15 years ago was looking at lots and lots of data

229
00:10:49.828 --> 00:10:52.768
on remote viewing and psychic ESP experiments,

230
00:10:52.768 --> 00:10:55.888
things like that, trying to see if there was some factor

231
00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:59.928
that enhanced your ability to receive information,

232
00:10:59.928 --> 00:11:01.988
made you more accurate.

233
00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:04.168
And he looked at everything, including weather,

234
00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:06.028
and time of day, and all those things.

235
00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:08.888
The only thing that had a positive response

236
00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:12.488
was where the stars are when you're receiving.

237
00:11:12.488 --> 00:11:17.488
You're most accurate as an ESP or psychic perceiver

238
00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:21.168
when the constellation Virgo is overhead.

239
00:11:21.168 --> 00:11:25.302
The astronomers call this 13.5 hours sidereal.

240
00:11:25.302 --> 00:11:27.683
It tells you which stars exactly are overhead,

241
00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:29.462
but it's roughly Virgo.

242
00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:34.143
It turns out there's a very unusual concentration of

243
00:11:34.143 --> 00:11:38.522
what they call dark matter in that part of the sky.

244
00:11:38.522 --> 00:11:40.662
Astronomers call it The Great Attractor

245
00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:45.662
because dark matter is essentially something where

246
00:11:45.723 --> 00:11:48.522
there's too much gravity, or the gravitational force

247
00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:51.962
is so strong, they can't really explain it by the matter

248
00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:54.802
they can see there, but they can tell from the motions

249
00:11:54.802 --> 00:11:56.543
there's a lot of gravity there.

250
00:11:56.543 --> 00:11:59.802
That would be associated by the Russians

251
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.782
with left handed torsion.

252
00:12:01.782 --> 00:12:04.022
Therefore, it looks like that would be the region

253
00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.963
where left hand torsion should be very strong in the sky

254
00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:08.962
and we're just finding out from Kozyrev,

255
00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.382
left handed torsion enhances ESP.

256
00:12:11.382 --> 00:12:14.102
So we might have an explanation for Spoteswood's

257
00:12:14.102 --> 00:12:17.682
observation that that part of the sky is where we have

258
00:12:17.682 --> 00:12:19.522
the strongest ESP effect.

259
00:12:19.522 --> 00:12:21.582
So that's the proposal, and it makes a lot of sense to me.

260
00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:23.242
<v ->It does make sense. That's very interesting</v>

261
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.203
because you're talking about dark matter,

262
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.623
you're also, as its compliment talking about dark energy,

263
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.862
we're talking about expansion and contraction

264
00:12:30.862 --> 00:12:33.562
of consciousness, we're at a Yuga Cycle conference,

265
00:12:33.562 --> 00:12:36.943
which is about cyclical expansion and contraction

266
00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:38.463
of consciousness.

267
00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:43.242
How does this left hand torsion, how does Virgo

268
00:12:43.242 --> 00:12:48.242
feed into these larger cycles of awakening and then

269
00:12:48.442 --> 00:12:50.722
falling back asleep?

270
00:12:50.722 --> 00:12:55.722
<v ->As you know, by looking back in the historical record,</v>

271
00:12:58.783 --> 00:13:03.362
the accounts that the Hindus have of history,

272
00:13:03.362 --> 00:13:08.002
the Vedic cycles, there are stories that suggest that

273
00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:10.013
we had a golden age.

274
00:13:10.013 --> 00:13:14.143
Roughly every 24,000 years or so we have these cycles

275
00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.662
of golden ages and dark ages,

276
00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:21.662
and we're now by that calculation in a rising time

277
00:13:21.922 --> 00:13:25.562
when consciousness is increasing, people are becoming

278
00:13:25.562 --> 00:13:28.662
more intuitive, more tuned in to things.

279
00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:32.602
So the Yuga Cycle Conference is talking about,

280
00:13:32.602 --> 00:13:36.603
number one, the evidence for such a cycle,

281
00:13:36.603 --> 00:13:39.922
and, number two, how could it possibly be understood?

282
00:13:39.922 --> 00:13:42.062
How can we explain such a thing?

283
00:13:42.062 --> 00:13:44.703
So the dark matter, dark energy come in

284
00:13:44.703 --> 00:13:46.862
as a possible explanation.

285
00:13:46.862 --> 00:13:50.803
My theory that I propose at the conference is that...

286
00:13:50.803 --> 00:13:54.902
Walter Cruttenden has talked about the idea

287
00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:59.143
that we're orbiting around some other unknown star,

288
00:13:59.143 --> 00:14:00.862
a dark star as he calls it.

289
00:14:00.862 --> 00:14:02.962
And therefore our solar system is not just

290
00:14:02.962 --> 00:14:06.883
sitting in one place in space, but actually moves in space,

291
00:14:06.883 --> 00:14:10.563
and at different times of year or of this long cycle,

292
00:14:10.563 --> 00:14:12.542
may be moving in different directions.

293
00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:16.842
So if we are moving toward Virgo, for example,

294
00:14:16.842 --> 00:14:19.163
at a particular time, that might enhance the

295
00:14:19.163 --> 00:14:22.383
effect of Virgo, that's the theory,

296
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:25.242
and might increase the effect of intuition.

297
00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:28.688
<v ->If it's affecting intuition, then it's affecting our</v>

298
00:14:28.688 --> 00:14:30.808
understanding of our world, technology,

299
00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:32.868
everything is expanding...

300
00:14:32.868 --> 00:14:34.678
<v ->People will have inventions more easily,</v>

301
00:14:34.678 --> 00:14:36.211
all kinds of ideas.

302
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:38.372
<v ->That's happening right now.</v>

303
00:14:38.372 --> 00:14:40.672
<v ->Right, it is. Exactly. Yeah.</v>

304
00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.791
And if it's happening now, according to the Yuga Cycle

305
00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:46.712
theory, it's gonna keep increasing.

306
00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:49.931
<v ->So we're in an area of great expansion</v>

307
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.031
in terms of our consiousness.

308
00:14:52.031 --> 00:14:54.792
And one of the things you also have talked about

309
00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:59.751
is the notion that in relationship to the dark matter,

310
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:04.751
we're looking at time as a phenomena in a different way.

311
00:15:05.052 --> 00:15:06.732
And I bring this up because I've read

312
00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:11.511
in various esoteric literature, for example,

313
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:16.391
that time passed differently in ancient times.

314
00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:18.171
We talk about the phenomena that people lived

315
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:21.711
to be 2, 3, 4, 600 years old in ancient times,

316
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:26.152
which has been documented in various texts.

317
00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:30.711
How do you see all this playing in together?

318
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:33.552
Is time actually passing differently, or was there

319
00:15:33.552 --> 00:15:38.431
some other different phenomena in terms of

320
00:15:38.431 --> 00:15:40.832
atmospheric, or something, that allowed us

321
00:15:40.832 --> 00:15:43.552
to live these lengths of time?

322
00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:47.931
<v ->It could be both.</v>

323
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:51.374
Torsion affects every other physical process.

324
00:15:51.374 --> 00:15:54.495
So when left handed torsion or right handed torsion changes,

325
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:59.495
our physics that we have today is built on our measurements,

326
00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:04.775
our observations, and they're based on the conditions

327
00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:06.395
that we are in right now,

328
00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:09.555
where those two properties have about an equal ratio,

329
00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:11.994
and they have a certain balance that we're kind of used to -

330
00:16:11.994 --> 00:16:14.355
This is normal for us.

331
00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:16.394
But if that ratio changes a little bit,

332
00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:17.895
the properties could change.

333
00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:19.574
So our concept of time could change,

334
00:16:19.574 --> 00:16:23.015
how long we live could change.

335
00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:25.060
<v ->And you wonder, just atmospherically...</v>

336
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.520
<v ->I had the pleasure of holding a little bone,</v>

337
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.241
it wasn't so little relatively speaking,

338
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:31.041
it was the occipital bone that was

339
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:34.640
from a person who was around 23 to 25 feet fall.

340
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.661
And it had gone through all the anatomy labs

341
00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:38.541
at the universities, it's the real deal.

342
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:40.860
I noticed it was quite porous.

343
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.780
So there is a possibility that, as you say,

344
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.260
it affects everything else.

345
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.480
And so perhaps there was less resistance, so to speak,

346
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.261
in our earthly environment we're living in,

347
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.180
with whatever this field of gravity is that allowed for

348
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.621
much larger types of entities to be here without

349
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:00.240
essentially just collapsing under their own weight.

350
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.640
This kind of thing. I mean, it's possible.

351
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.550
<v ->It's possible.
<v ->It's possible,</v>

352
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.290
but the thing is, what I love about what you're

353
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.070
talking about is, my mind is going in a thousand directions

354
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.124
as to what is possible.

355
00:17:10.124 --> 00:17:14.124
<v ->What has happened so far in some of the Russian work -</v>

356
00:17:14.124 --> 00:17:19.124
They are trying to apply this energy to devices

357
00:17:19.424 --> 00:17:21.824
and technologies.

358
00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:24.004
Some real basic ones...

359
00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:25.424
If you take a photograph of the earth

360
00:17:25.424 --> 00:17:27.404
from an airplane looking down,

361
00:17:27.404 --> 00:17:29.684
which is how people look for minerals and things,

362
00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:34.684
the torsion being emitted from the earth gets captured

363
00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:37.805
by the photographic emulsion.

364
00:17:37.805 --> 00:17:39.244
So they can analyze the emulsion

365
00:17:39.244 --> 00:17:40.844
to get the torsion signature.

366
00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:43.984
It's one more way of analyzing the mineral content

367
00:17:43.984 --> 00:17:45.564
of the earth.
<v ->Interesting.</v>

368
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:50.025
<v ->But even more far out, they have built a little chamber</v>

369
00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:52.545
where they have little generators outside the chamber

370
00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:55.605
sending torsion waves into the chamber,

371
00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:57.924
and they can make torsion waves which are either

372
00:17:57.924 --> 00:18:00.244
right handed torsion or left handed torsion.

373
00:18:00.244 --> 00:18:01.564
<v ->So it's a generator so to speak?</v>

374
00:18:01.564 --> 00:18:04.585
<v ->It's a generator, but it concentrates them</v>

375
00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:08.984
in a volume inside, and that speeds up or slows down

376
00:18:08.984 --> 00:18:11.764
time inside this chamber.

377
00:18:11.764 --> 00:18:15.184
They've done experiments with clocks, wristwatches,

378
00:18:15.184 --> 00:18:19.524
for starters, but then with animals as well.

379
00:18:19.524 --> 00:18:21.784
<v ->What were those experiments like?</v>

380
00:18:21.784 --> 00:18:25.065
<v ->One of the problems is that, if they don't have the</v>

381
00:18:25.065 --> 00:18:27.664
time density the same throughout the chamber,

382
00:18:27.664 --> 00:18:29.304
there are bad health consequences.

383
00:18:29.304 --> 00:18:32.204
<v ->Possibly! (laughs)</v>

384
00:18:32.204 --> 00:18:34.064
<v ->You don't want your arm to be caught in the same speed</v>

385
00:18:34.064 --> 00:18:36.564
as everything else.

386
00:18:36.564 --> 00:18:38.545
But that's what they've been experimenting with, so,

387
00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:40.454
I don't know how far this could go,

388
00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:43.204
a time machine? I don't know.

389
00:18:43.204 --> 00:18:44.774
But certainly slowing the rate

390
00:18:44.774 --> 00:18:46.594
or speeding the rate of time

391
00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:48.565
you can imagine all kinds of possible...

392
00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:51.184
<v ->And they've been working on teleportation for a while,</v>

393
00:18:51.184 --> 00:18:53.744
and Michio Kaku is even talking about teleportation

394
00:18:53.744 --> 00:18:58.744
becoming a relatively forthcoming reality.

395
00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:01.044
<v ->Los Angeles could use it for the commute.</v>

396
00:19:01.044 --> 00:19:02.504
<v ->Yes they sure could.</v>

397
00:19:02.504 --> 00:19:05.644
So could you, as much as you're flying.

398
00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:09.424
We just touched on, for a moment, remote viewing.

399
00:19:09.424 --> 00:19:14.424
And when we're looking at these anomalies within time space,

400
00:19:15.884 --> 00:19:18.425
when you take these other considerations into account,

401
00:19:18.425 --> 00:19:21.324
we're looking at things such as remote viewing,

402
00:19:21.324 --> 00:19:23.184
we're looking at distant healing,

403
00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:25.684
and can you talk a little bit about how this

404
00:19:25.684 --> 00:19:29.904
interfaces with our ability to look into or heal

405
00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:34.904
at a distance, and either forward or backward in time?

406
00:19:35.484 --> 00:19:39.964
<v ->One of the big challenges to Western science has been</v>

407
00:19:39.964 --> 00:19:42.004
trying to understand a lot of this stuff.

408
00:19:42.004 --> 00:19:45.904
Healers can project their energy or can heal somebody

409
00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:48.084
thousands of miles away.

410
00:19:48.084 --> 00:19:49.804
When they do, it's like they're in

411
00:19:49.804 --> 00:19:52.624
instantaneous contact with that person.

412
00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:55.444
They often describe almost like a holographic image

413
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.224
of the person right in front of them,

414
00:19:57.224 --> 00:20:00.044
and they can work on the holographic image of that organ

415
00:20:00.044 --> 00:20:02.684
and have an effect on the person.

416
00:20:02.684 --> 00:20:06.444
Our physics has no way to explain that right now.

417
00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:09.524
Electromagnetism can't do it because distances...

418
00:20:09.524 --> 00:20:13.024
It drops off where the distance is too weak.

419
00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:16.524
Torsion appears to be a possible way of understanding

420
00:20:16.524 --> 00:20:20.565
and explaining scientifically how long range healing works

421
00:20:20.565 --> 00:20:23.364
as well as ESP and other psychic phenomena.

422
00:20:23.364 --> 00:20:27.704
All those phenomena are alike in that they don't get

423
00:20:27.704 --> 00:20:31.744
weaker with distance, they can transmit over huge distances,

424
00:20:31.744 --> 00:20:35.524
and you can send signals forward and backward in time.

425
00:20:35.524 --> 00:20:37.464
You're not limited to just the present.

426
00:20:37.464 --> 00:20:42.464
So torsion appears to be the beginining of a new science

427
00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:45.344
that could explain all this stuff, help create

428
00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.064
a real science from it.

429
00:20:47.064 --> 00:20:49.784
<v ->Thank goodness. Because no one was paying attention</v>

430
00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:52.605
to chi, or prana, I mean,

431
00:20:52.605 --> 00:20:54.505
the people that are practicioners and use it

432
00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:57.244
and understand it, qigong masters certainly pay attention,

433
00:20:57.244 --> 00:20:59.145
these are some phenomenally highly-developed

434
00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:00.524
people on this planet.

435
00:21:00.524 --> 00:21:01.504
<v ->Right, right.</v>

436
00:21:01.504 --> 00:21:04.964
<v ->But for the Western mind, we need someone to do science</v>

437
00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:07.704
just to allow us to even contemplate the possibilities,

438
00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:09.024
no less apply them, right?

439
00:21:09.024 --> 00:21:10.844
Hasn't that been the problem?

440
00:21:10.844 --> 00:21:13.764
<v ->Yes. I think that's the scientific naysayers,</v>

441
00:21:13.764 --> 00:21:17.304
and I understand it because I am a scientist

442
00:21:17.304 --> 00:21:19.725
and I went through the conventional education,

443
00:21:19.725 --> 00:21:22.364
when you come across some of this data, your mind

444
00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:24.084
kind of boggles initially.

445
00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:26.664
Like, how can that possibly be?

446
00:21:26.664 --> 00:21:29.184
It goes against everything I learned in school,

447
00:21:29.184 --> 00:21:31.424
therefore it must be wrong.

448
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:34.404
So you have to catch yourself on that point

449
00:21:34.404 --> 00:21:37.484
and look at the data objectively.

450
00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:40.004
And once you see that these things are real,

451
00:21:40.004 --> 00:21:43.205
then step back and say, how can we change our science

452
00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:45.384
to begin to understand some of this stuff.

453
00:21:45.384 --> 00:21:47.845
<v ->Also you have the media playing into it as well.</v>

454
00:21:47.845 --> 00:21:50.105
If anything is new or different, the media almost feels

455
00:21:50.105 --> 00:21:52.745
obliged to create a giggle factor and discredit it.

456
00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:54.764
That's not helping with common perception,

457
00:21:54.764 --> 00:21:56.544
but I think people are getting onto that.

458
00:21:56.544 --> 00:21:58.684
<v ->The aspirin industry does not want healers around</v>

459
00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:00.744
making everybody feel good.

460
00:22:00.744 --> 00:22:03.724
They want to sell their pills.

461
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:08.204
<v ->Well the good thing is, there are so many incredible...</v>

462
00:22:08.204 --> 00:22:10.144
especially in the world of physics,

463
00:22:10.144 --> 00:22:13.844
people coming to the fore that have tiptoed out - "gulp"

464
00:22:13.844 --> 00:22:16.005
and said, "Look, this is what I think is happening,"

465
00:22:16.005 --> 00:22:18.405
which is meaning they're risking reputation,

466
00:22:18.405 --> 00:22:22.665
they might even be risking tenure, in the worst of cases.

467
00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:24.984
But we have Dean Radin, for example.

468
00:22:24.984 --> 00:22:27.504
He's taking this information you're talking about,

469
00:22:27.504 --> 00:22:29.424
which I guess you would call the torsion field,

470
00:22:29.424 --> 00:22:31.664
and he's saying this has to do with entanglement, right?

471
00:22:31.664 --> 00:22:33.424
So his word that he's applying is,

472
00:22:33.424 --> 00:22:35.084
everything is entangled through the field

473
00:22:35.084 --> 00:22:37.344
of consciousness or torsion.

474
00:22:37.344 --> 00:22:39.464
I like the word torsion, and I like Russian scientists,

475
00:22:39.464 --> 00:22:40.724
so, this works.

476
00:22:40.724 --> 00:22:43.625
And then we have Konstantin Korotkov,

477
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:47.624
and he's been very successfully working with

478
00:22:47.624 --> 00:22:50.564
finding ways to actually measure the subtle field.

479
00:22:50.564 --> 00:22:52.224
Can you talk about that a bit? Cause that's been

480
00:22:52.224 --> 00:22:55.004
a buggaboo, the fly in the ointment is

481
00:22:55.004 --> 00:22:56.425
you can't measure it easily.

482
00:22:56.425 --> 00:23:01.425
<v ->Yeah. I think his technique is one of the few and the best</v>

483
00:23:02.504 --> 00:23:05.664
available right now that does seem to be measuring it.

484
00:23:05.664 --> 00:23:09.744
Basically what he's doing is called Kirlian photography.

485
00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:13.404
You take a fingertip, for example, apply a small voltage,

486
00:23:13.404 --> 00:23:16.284
a sharp short voltage across the fingertip

487
00:23:16.284 --> 00:23:19.384
to a photographic plate, and you get a little spark.

488
00:23:19.384 --> 00:23:23.204
And the spark image takes a picture, but it shows up

489
00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:26.164
something that's not visible on the finger, something

490
00:23:26.164 --> 00:23:31.164
that looks like what psychic healers call the aura.

491
00:23:31.365 --> 00:23:34.524
It's something around the fingertip that has various colors

492
00:23:34.524 --> 00:23:38.444
to it, and it seems to correlate with health.

493
00:23:38.444 --> 00:23:43.325
What he has done is very systematic, careful surveys

494
00:23:43.325 --> 00:23:47.124
of thousands of people, looking at their health qualities,

495
00:23:47.124 --> 00:23:50.024
what problems they have, comparing it to the patterns,

496
00:23:50.024 --> 00:23:53.424
and he's been able to produce a quantitative machine

497
00:23:53.424 --> 00:23:56.725
that can produce a quantitative picture of what he calls

498
00:23:56.725 --> 00:24:00.524
the aura, which seems like what the healers are seeing

499
00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:04.985
as the aura, and it's based on his spark discharge images.

500
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.465
Now there are skeptics who will tell you that

501
00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:09.704
if you put something inert, like a coin,

502
00:24:09.704 --> 00:24:12.464
on this little machine, it'll make an aura too,

503
00:24:12.464 --> 00:24:16.584
but if you look at the details of the information that comes

504
00:24:16.584 --> 00:24:20.845
from his technology, there's a lot more to it than that.

505
00:24:20.845 --> 00:24:23.364
And actually I've been able to correlate that with the

506
00:24:23.364 --> 00:24:25.425
torsion work with the Russians, because it turns out

507
00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:29.164
that right handed torsion and left handed torsion

508
00:24:29.164 --> 00:24:32.664
both communicate information about the nature

509
00:24:32.664 --> 00:24:34.984
of the physiological process.

510
00:24:34.984 --> 00:24:37.605
One of them makes the spark bigger,

511
00:24:37.605 --> 00:24:39.744
and the other makes the spark smaller.

512
00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:41.804
So the spark size does correlate with

513
00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:43.424
the kind of torsion that's present..

514
00:24:43.424 --> 00:24:46.105
<v ->Interesting. And I think that Konstantin was also</v>

515
00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:51.044
working with environmental factors in his readings...

516
00:24:51.044 --> 00:24:53.644
We're going to get back together

517
00:24:53.644 --> 00:24:55.284
because we had such a short time today.

518
00:24:55.284 --> 00:24:58.584
We're going to talk live from the studios in Boulder,

519
00:24:58.584 --> 00:25:01.484
in a short time coming, hopefully, and get into a little bit

520
00:25:01.484 --> 00:25:04.364
more of this, because Konstantin's work, for example

521
00:25:04.364 --> 00:25:08.085
is showing the nature of these lade lines, water,

522
00:25:08.085 --> 00:25:11.824
sacred sites, he's measuring all this to see why it is

523
00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:14.324
that these - first of all, the ancients understood

524
00:25:14.324 --> 00:25:16.684
something was going on and created great edifices

525
00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:17.904
on these places.

526
00:25:17.904 --> 00:25:20.864
And secondly, what they're capable of doing as a result

527
00:25:20.864 --> 00:25:23.624
of being in these energetic hotspots.

528
00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:26.404
And as I said a moment ago, they're beginning

529
00:25:26.404 --> 00:25:28.685
to measure scientifcally.

530
00:25:28.685 --> 00:25:30.744
<v ->When people are together, praying or meditating,</v>

531
00:25:30.744 --> 00:25:33.364
these devices also show the effects of that.

532
00:25:33.364 --> 00:25:37.564
So we're creating or concentrating subtle energy or torsion

533
00:25:37.564 --> 00:25:39.864
when we do conscious processes together.

534
00:25:39.864 --> 00:25:40.924
So, it's exciting...

535
00:25:40.924 --> 00:25:41.905
<v ->It is exciting.</v>

536
00:25:41.905 --> 00:25:46.905
Talk about what's on your site regarding that.

537
00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:49.424
<v ->One of the things on my website is a page</v>

538
00:25:49.424 --> 00:25:51.524
called Global Peace Prayer.

539
00:25:51.524 --> 00:25:54.064
We're in 2012.

540
00:25:54.064 --> 00:25:58.744
A lot of people predict we may have some disruptions,

541
00:25:58.744 --> 00:26:01.564
chaos, et cetera, and so I'm trying to use

542
00:26:01.564 --> 00:26:05.845
synchronized prayer to increase our chances

543
00:26:05.845 --> 00:26:08.884
of getting through this time in the most peaceful and loving

544
00:26:08.884 --> 00:26:11.724
and forgiving way possible.

545
00:26:11.724 --> 00:26:15.704
Because we have in many ways a wonderful

546
00:26:15.704 --> 00:26:17.425
world we have created.

547
00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:20.564
There's conflicts and hardships, but there's also

548
00:26:20.564 --> 00:26:23.324
a lot of good things, and I think the best way

549
00:26:23.324 --> 00:26:26.645
to move forward if we can is just to learn how to

550
00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:30.285
maintain that and to keep people happy.

551
00:26:30.285 --> 00:26:32.284
<v ->Stay focused on it.
<v ->Focused consciousness has</v>

552
00:26:32.284 --> 00:26:34.504
tremendous power to do that.

553
00:26:34.504 --> 00:26:36.745
<v ->And that plays into these torsion fields, too,</v>

554
00:26:36.745 --> 00:26:38.644
which we're going to talk about a whole lot more

555
00:26:38.644 --> 00:26:39.885
next time we get together.

556
00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:40.465
<v ->Great.</v>

557
00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.792
<v ->Thank you so much for your time.</v>

558
00:26:41.792 --> 00:26:43.622
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

559
00:26:44.552 --> 00:26:47.832
For a greater understanding of the physics behind phenomena,

560
00:26:47.832 --> 00:26:50.512
you might also enjoy my previous interview with Claude.

561
00:26:50.512 --> 00:26:52.692
Meanwhile, Claude's four and a half pound book

562
00:26:52.692 --> 00:26:55.652
cuts no corners in showing how the invisible works

563
00:26:55.652 --> 00:26:56.932
in our lives.

564
00:26:56.932 --> 00:26:59.612
You can find both The Synchronized Universe and Life Force

565
00:26:59.612 --> 00:27:01.272
through all major booksellers.

566
00:27:01.272 --> 00:27:03.273
Meanwhile, you might also enjoy our interviews

567
00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:06.173
with Konstantin Korotkov and Harry Oldfield

568
00:27:06.173 --> 00:27:07.813
on the photographing and measuring

569
00:27:07.813 --> 00:27:10.232
of these subtle yet all-pervasive fields.

570
00:27:10.232 --> 00:27:13.691
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

571
00:27:13.691 --> 00:27:17.171
