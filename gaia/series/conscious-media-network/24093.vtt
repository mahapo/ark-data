00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:02.420
<v ->One of the great mysteries of the world</v>

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.155
has been the Shroud of Turin,

3
00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.791
in which the image of a man many believe is Jesus

4
00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:09.527
is in effect burned into a piece of cloth.

5
00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:12.147
James Barrett has spent the last seven years

6
00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:13.931
researching the scientific data

7
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:15.767
that's been gathered on the shroud

8
00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:17.535
and has expanded the research to include

9
00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.704
ancient spiritual technologies.

10
00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.607
The result of this melding of science and spiritual wisdom

11
00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:25.343
is the discovery of a signature frequency

12
00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:28.447
of the human heart that allows for ascension.

13
00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:30.515
The frequency of compassion.

14
00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:35.370 line:15% 
(peaceful music)

15
00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:40.558
<v Voiceover>We're talking about</v>

16
00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:42.160
the intelligence of the heart.

17
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.096
This is a subject that's been for the last decade

18
00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:46.898
beginning to come to the forefront,

19
00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:50.014
but you're looking at it in an entirely fresh way.

20
00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:51.604
We're going to get into that,

21
00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:53.171
but first of all what is it in you,

22
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:54.572
in your background,

23
00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:57.742
that set you on this path to begin with?

24
00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.714
<v ->Well, I guess it started really with</v>

25
00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:05.117
this interest in the mystical traditions

26
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:07.852
and looking at the different mystical traditions.

27
00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:09.620
Raised a Catholic,

28
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.390
there was the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart.

29
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.592
From all the traditions,

30
00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:18.890
even in the Egyptian, you come back to the purified heart.

31
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.567
I looked more deeply from those perspectives,

32
00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.469
from the mystical traditions,

33
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.203
at the heart.

34
00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:29.640
As you looked at it in depth,

35
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.645
they kept putting it towards attunement,

36
00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:36.247
alignment, harmony.

37
00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:38.616
They used words and descriptions

38
00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:40.618
that seemed to me

39
00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:43.021
that if you were in this day and age,

40
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.991
we should be able to look at that,

41
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:47.993
find a signature for that,

42
00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:51.196
and gradually that's what we worked into.

43
00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:54.865
<v Voiceover>How does this blend in with</v>

44
00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:57.269
or dovetail somewhat with the work

45
00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.904
at the HeartMath Institute?

46
00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:03.342
We can start seeing where things flow in and flow out.

47
00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:06.277
A little bit later I want to get into how

48
00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:08.479
the technology itself was developed.

49
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.149
<v ->Right, well the HeartMath is a wonderful institution.</v>

50
00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.152
They've done wonderful work

51
00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:17.221
and they look at the heart strictly

52
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.290
from heart rate variability,

53
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.261
which is a specific spectrum of the wave form.

54
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:24.962
Not to get too technical,

55
00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:26.530
but when you look at the spectrum

56
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.066
or the harmonic of the heart

57
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.733
and you take out the lower slices,

58
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.136
the long waves in the really low area,

59
00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:35.140
you can look at it in the time domain,

60
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.975
or you can look at in the the frequency domain,

61
00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:38.376
or both.

62
00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:41.078
You can look at the frequencies and see what's going on,

63
00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.047
or you can look at it in the time domain.

64
00:02:43.047 --> 00:02:44.816
Originally heart rate variability

65
00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:47.552
was just looking at the differences

66
00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:49.854
between beat to beat

67
00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:53.691
in respect to the breathing, to respiration,

68
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:57.161
but as they looked into it more closely,

69
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.197
you could find a lot of information embedded

70
00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:03.768
within the harmonics that are present

71
00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:06.570
in the low frequency ranges of the heart.

72
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.306
When you clap your hands,

73
00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.476
there's a whole spectrum of frequencies that are present

74
00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:13.111
in that one sound.

75
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:14.445
When your heart beats,

76
00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:17.715
there's a symphony of frequencies present,

77
00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:21.285
and you can look at the really long low waves.

78
00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:25.023
Heart rate variability is below a half a hertz.

79
00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:27.959
That's a long wave, okay?
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

80
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.128
<v ->What that information tells you and talks to you about</v>

81
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.932
is about the autonomic nervous system

82
00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:37.668
and the different branches of it,

83
00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:40.404
the parasympathetic and sympathetic.

84
00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:43.808
Those two, one speeds you up and one slows you down.

85
00:03:43.808 --> 00:03:46.210
They work through the heart to do that

86
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.647
and all the different organs come into play,

87
00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:53.117
the adrenals and your breathing and perspiration

88
00:03:53.117 --> 00:03:55.219
and things like this.

89
00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.323
As they come into phase or balance,

90
00:03:58.323 --> 00:04:01.361
what was found was that you have

91
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:04.762
optimizing your immune system,

92
00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:07.465
you had greater peace,

93
00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.133
and then they found that a lot of that

94
00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:12.269
had to do with the psychological positioning you were in

95
00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.741
at the moment, so gratitude and appreciation.

96
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:18.143
Genuine feelings, positive feelings

97
00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:21.446
tended to enhance

98
00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:24.882
positive heart rate variability.

99
00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:27.652
When they looked into this in depth,

100
00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:30.255
they found that heart rate variability

101
00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:34.692
is at the core of most chronic diseases.

102
00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.892
That's pretty important.

103
00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:40.618
<v Voiceover>That's what the ancients understood.</v>

104
00:04:40.618 --> 00:04:41.732
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

105
00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:43.968
<v Voiceover>We'll bring this full circle</v>

106
00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:46.871
with what they found with what the ancients also knew,

107
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.007
running through your work as well.

108
00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:52.610
In the mid '90s,

109
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.913
what made you decide to get involved with this,

110
00:04:55.913 --> 00:04:58.316
even down to the technology

111
00:04:58.316 --> 00:05:01.253
of utilizing technology to interface

112
00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:04.288
and read the rhythms of the heart yourself?

113
00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:08.226
<v ->Well, originally I built a healing retreat center</v>

114
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:10.962
with a bunch of people over in North Carolina,

115
00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:12.631
and at this center

116
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.667
I witnessed different levels of healing

117
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.270
that previous to that time

118
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.773
I didn't think was really possible,

119
00:05:21.773 --> 00:05:24.709
understanding what I understood about the body

120
00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:26.911
and how the body worked.

121
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:30.848
Currently, I understand it to be much different.

122
00:05:30.848 --> 00:05:34.219
My interest in human potentiality

123
00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.988
and what you're capable of,

124
00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:38.991
because you look at the medical literature,

125
00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:42.028
the volumes of people with spontaneous healings,

126
00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:46.531
spiritual traditions, all these things that they do.

127
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:49.734
How is that possible?

128
00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:52.204
For me, it seemed to always come back

129
00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:55.473
to centering on the heart.

130
00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:57.876
When I found out early in the '90s

131
00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:59.877
that the heart was autogenic,

132
00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:03.480
what means it doesn't have an outside source to beat,

133
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.084
in other words it doesn't get information from the brain

134
00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:09.421
or any other source for its operations,

135
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:12.757
I was like, "That's a pretty important fact right there."

136
00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:14.826
Then when I heard from a coroner at one time

137
00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:16.493
that there were neural cells embedded

138
00:06:16.493 --> 00:06:18.495
in the tissue of the heart,

139
00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:20.197
and then through the mystical traditions

140
00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:24.402
the idea of the heart having its own innate intelligence

141
00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:27.706
and aims and desires,

142
00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:31.989
started to dovetail together for me.

143
00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:35.447
To see how one issue

144
00:06:35.447 --> 00:06:37.382
related to the other issues

145
00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:39.250
and they all seemed to fit.

146
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.053
Heart rate variability, if you understand it,

147
00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:45.222
really is at a point today

148
00:06:45.222 --> 00:06:49.393
where they are literally talking yoga. (laughs)

149
00:06:49.393 --> 00:06:51.199
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

150
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.930
(laughs) Science is dovetailing yoga.

151
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.698
<v ->The science of yoga,</v>

152
00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:57.902
you can look at it from Western medical perspectives.

153
00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:01.906
The idea for me was how and what is the actual signature

154
00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:03.875
that you're actually looking for?

155
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.777
What is the optimized signature

156
00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:08.946
for what the ancients would say

157
00:07:08.946 --> 00:07:12.917
would be an open, a receptive, compassionate heart?

158
00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:14.885
<v Voiceover>That's what you were looking for</v>

159
00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:16.693
when you had started developing your ...

160
00:07:16.693 --> 00:07:18.089
It was a little device

161
00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:20.224
that essentially is an EKG device

162
00:07:20.224 --> 00:07:22.192
but developed for a different purpose.

163
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.662
<v ->We looked at,</v>

164
00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:25.530
we tried to develop a device

165
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.400
that not only looked at the harmonic,

166
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.368
but looked at the relationship of the harmonic.

167
00:07:30.368 --> 00:07:33.771
The reason for this was because in mathematics

168
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.774
and geometry and sacred geometry,

169
00:07:36.774 --> 00:07:40.110
there are models that help to describe

170
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.848
openness and receptivity and things of that nature.

171
00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:47.585
We were looking to see if those same things were present

172
00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:51.055
in the harmonic, the relationship of the frequencies

173
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:52.990
at that time.

174
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.459
There was several people that helped

175
00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.395
to come up with a methodology of doing that,

176
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.766
plus the computer speeds increased at that time.

177
00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:03.935
There was a lot of things that came together,

178
00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:05.404
the internet.

179
00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:07.805
They all weren't really present prior to this time,

180
00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:09.940
and when they started to be developed,

181
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.042
they were in their infancy.

182
00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:16.281
Now, as we pushed to the mid '90s,

183
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:20.051
we had the tools available to actually start to

184
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:24.722
conceptualize something that would be able to be hooked up,

185
00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:28.025
use the ECG information,

186
00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:32.129
and then transform that using fast Fourier transforms

187
00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:35.333
in a way that we could look at the information

188
00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:38.202
from a novel perspective.

189
00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:39.997
A different way.

190
00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Voiceover>As you developed this technology,</v>

191
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.075
what did you begin discovering

192
00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:48.178
that has put you even further on your path

193
00:08:48.178 --> 00:08:50.881
of inquiry and discovery into --

194
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:52.349
<v ->Great question.</v>

195
00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:53.885
This is the question.

196
00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:57.221
For me personally, when you sat down and you looked at,

197
00:08:57.221 --> 00:09:00.224
this is a feedback device,

198
00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:04.693
so you're seeing your heart's music in real time,

199
00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:08.232
or what we perceive as real time.

200
00:09:08.232 --> 00:09:10.635
There's a whole story that we can go into there

201
00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.170
about that information

202
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.007
because real time is pretty interesting in and of itself.

203
00:09:16.007 --> 00:09:19.276
When you looked at your information,

204
00:09:19.276 --> 00:09:24.014
you could see how thought and thinking affected the heart,

205
00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:27.918
and then what you noticed if you were paying attention

206
00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:30.988
or did this at any degree of frequency,

207
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:34.893
you'd notice that you were watching your thoughts.

208
00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:39.096
The question that rose inside me is

209
00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:40.544
what's watching my thoughts?

210
00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:42.466
<v Voiceover>Right, that's what I was just going to ask.</v>

211
00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:44.067
What's watching?

212
00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.803
<v ->In science, in consciousness research,</v>

213
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:50.741
you would call it the witnessing or non-local self

214
00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:54.178
because you can't pinpoint it in any one place.

215
00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:56.914
Actually Candace Pert and people like that,

216
00:09:56.914 --> 00:09:58.448
looking at emotions,

217
00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:01.419
found that mind plays the central role in development

218
00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:03.220
and it happens spontaneous

219
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.990
through quantum mechanical processes.

220
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.825
Quantum coherence, quantum entanglement,

221
00:10:07.825 --> 00:10:09.293
things of this nature.

222
00:10:09.293 --> 00:10:12.663
All those type of things that happen with the body

223
00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:15.199
at the small level

224
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.435
really begin and originate out of an impulse

225
00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:20.304
that comes from a non-local or quantum,

226
00:10:20.304 --> 00:10:24.758
that's a conceptual idea of it, place.

227
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.979
The intelligence, which we might call the soul,

228
00:10:28.979 --> 00:10:32.183
impulses through,

229
00:10:32.183 --> 00:10:34.885
and when I researched it in more depth,

230
00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:36.954
the Sufis have the best model for this.

231
00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:38.722
You have the egoic self

232
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:41.158
that deals in past and future.

233
00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:44.663
It's process deals in time.

234
00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:48.032
The heart deals in the present.

235
00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:50.134
It deals in the now.

236
00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:52.572
It creates reality for you.

237
00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:56.707
The soul deals in the eternal.

238
00:10:56.707 --> 00:10:59.610
It's timeless, meaning no time.

239
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.712
Not endless time, no time.

240
00:11:01.712 --> 00:11:04.281
It's atemporal.

241
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:08.308
This aspect of mind self

242
00:11:08.308 --> 00:11:11.055
pulls on the heart for the creation of reality

243
00:11:11.055 --> 00:11:15.295
and the egoic self that helps you stay here, present,

244
00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:18.195
getting to some place on time,

245
00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:19.864
it deals with time.

246
00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:21.866
Those two aspects pull on the heart

247
00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:24.468
for the creation of your reality.

248
00:11:24.468 --> 00:11:26.370
They impulse your heart,

249
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.007
and if the egoic self, survival based, is more strong

250
00:11:30.007 --> 00:11:33.177
then that's what becomes your reality

251
00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:36.580
and if the soul level is more powerful,

252
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.517
then for sure you need more courage in your life

253
00:11:39.517 --> 00:11:42.453
because that's why it's a heart quality.

254
00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:44.222
Without courage --
<v Voiceover>Without courage.</v>

255
00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:46.390
<v ->... you don't follow the soul so easily.</v>

256
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.258
<v Voiceover>That is so true.</v>

257
00:11:50.048 --> 00:11:52.796
<v ->It's not interested in your survival.</v>

258
00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:56.334
It's eternal, the soul.

259
00:11:56.334 --> 00:12:00.371
Its goal is the attainment of

260
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:03.373
self recognition

261
00:12:03.373 --> 00:12:06.244
on a very large level.

262
00:12:06.244 --> 00:12:09.980
Self awareness on a very broad spectrum

263
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.982
of understanding that term,

264
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:13.584
not just understanding me,

265
00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:15.319
why I do the things I do,

266
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:19.123
but understanding truly the nature of self

267
00:12:19.123 --> 00:12:21.592
and the broad scheme of things.

268
00:12:21.592 --> 00:12:25.696
It goes from spiritual, back into the mystical,

269
00:12:25.696 --> 00:12:28.300
back into the scientific.

270
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.702
The scientific is in the same place.

271
00:12:31.702 --> 00:12:34.472
<v Voiceover>Right, it's all coming from the same place.</v>

272
00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:35.503
<v ->It's all --</v>

273
00:12:35.503 --> 00:12:37.575
<v Voiceover>It's just a different vocabulary.</v>

274
00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:41.912
<v ->The awareness that is the mind in the now,</v>

275
00:12:41.912 --> 00:12:45.184
and the awareness that's in the present,

276
00:12:45.184 --> 00:12:48.886
is the heart actually speaking through you.

277
00:12:48.886 --> 00:12:53.340
Heart intelligence has a knowing

278
00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:57.828
about your real reason to be here.

279
00:12:57.828 --> 00:13:00.666
Your dharma, your purpose.

280
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:03.234
It calls you, it yearns.

281
00:13:03.234 --> 00:13:05.938
When you're yearning is pulling you someplace

282
00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:07.972
even thought the egoic self says,

283
00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:11.008
"If we do that, we might not have any money.

284
00:13:11.008 --> 00:13:13.010
"We might be broke.

285
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.045
"We might want to think this twice.

286
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:18.649
"We tried this in the '80s and it didn't work."

287
00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:22.453
This is the heart, and that's calling from the soul.

288
00:13:22.453 --> 00:13:24.922
That's my understanding of it.

289
00:13:24.922 --> 00:13:27.925
That's what is the interesting about the device,

290
00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:32.015
is that when we played with this on any level,

291
00:13:32.015 --> 00:13:34.798
you kept coming back to noticing

292
00:13:34.798 --> 00:13:37.134
that there was an aspect of yourself

293
00:13:37.134 --> 00:13:40.604
witnessing this.

294
00:13:40.604 --> 00:13:43.874
When my son passed away in 2000,

295
00:13:43.874 --> 00:13:47.912
I experienced this on a extended period of time.

296
00:13:47.912 --> 00:13:52.052
My desires shifted from wanting to create

297
00:13:52.052 --> 00:13:55.286
the device and the company and the tools

298
00:13:55.286 --> 00:13:59.523
to more or less wishing to research the information

299
00:13:59.523 --> 00:14:03.694
and validate the experience in a rational way.

300
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:08.599
<v Voiceover>Which led you to publishing a book,</v>

301
00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:11.101
The Silent Gospel.

302
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.869
<v ->Seven years, it's taken.</v>

303
00:14:12.869 --> 00:14:14.504
<v Voiceover>Seven years it's taken</v>

304
00:14:14.504 --> 00:14:16.106
to publish The Silent Gospel,

305
00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:18.109
which is quite interesting.

306
00:14:18.109 --> 00:14:19.943
It would almost seem like a non sequitur,

307
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.111
but it's not

308
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:25.315
because you go into the analysis on a profound level

309
00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:27.651
of the Shroud of Turin,

310
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:31.304
which of course is still one of the great mysteries.

311
00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:35.359
Can you go ahead and then make the leap from where you were,

312
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:37.395
what you had discovered at that point in time,

313
00:14:37.395 --> 00:14:39.029
the path you were already on,

314
00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:43.133
all of the new questions and such that came up

315
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.770
as a result of the death of your son,

316
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.506
to seven years later publishing this book, The Silent Gospel

317
00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:52.860
and why you've done it and what it's about?

318
00:14:54.212 --> 00:14:55.947
<v ->That's a really big question --</v>

319
00:14:55.947 --> 00:14:58.182
<v Voiceover>It's a lot of questions in one question.</v>

320
00:14:58.182 --> 00:15:00.884
<v ->The long and the short is that</v>

321
00:15:00.884 --> 00:15:04.789
I had a real deep interest in human potentiality

322
00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:07.090
and the mystical traditions

323
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.959
and understanding myself

324
00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.960
and heart intelligence.

325
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.400
During the process of burying my son,

326
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.638
he had a book on his nightstand on the Shroud of Turin,

327
00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:23.807
and I had a true epiphany.

328
00:15:23.807 --> 00:15:28.311
Those big ah-has where everything is clear and simple.

329
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:30.682
It's taken seven years

330
00:15:30.682 --> 00:15:32.616
and a lot of water has gone under the bridge

331
00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:34.184
to get to this place,

332
00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:37.421
but at that moment in time it seemed like it's perfect.

333
00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:40.891
I could use the shroud and explain how the image

334
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:43.394
was created on the shroud

335
00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:47.464
using the value that I've learned on compassion.

336
00:15:47.464 --> 00:15:49.633
The teachings of all the great masters,

337
00:15:49.633 --> 00:15:52.069
not just Jesus, but all of the masters,

338
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:55.815
Buddha lived 500 years before Jesus.

339
00:15:55.815 --> 00:16:00.443
The Vedas are from 1500 years before Jesus.

340
00:16:00.443 --> 00:16:03.680
There's a history and a development here

341
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.285
of understanding human physicality

342
00:16:08.285 --> 00:16:12.155
on a level that we are just coming to understand again.

343
00:16:12.155 --> 00:16:14.526
There's a renaissance of understanding this.

344
00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:16.327
The quantum, What the Bleep,

345
00:16:16.327 --> 00:16:18.829
the law of attraction, and these different ideas that --

346
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:19.763
<v Voiceover>The Secret.</v>

347
00:16:19.763 --> 00:16:23.030
<v ->The Secret, they're all coming out now with</v>

348
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.605
bits of understanding this broader concept

349
00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:29.839
about our true nature,

350
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:34.011
what we are truly come from.

351
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:38.348
What we are part of.

352
00:16:38.348 --> 00:16:42.820
As I put the two together in that big ah-ha moment,

353
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.590
I literally received the complete

354
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.059
table of contents for the book.

355
00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:50.961
I said, "If I do this and I do this

356
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:52.796
"and I show this and I show that,

357
00:16:52.796 --> 00:16:55.332
"it all makes perfect sense to me."

358
00:16:55.332 --> 00:16:57.968
Then as you do it and somebody else looks at it,

359
00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.920
they say, "How did you get from here to there?"

360
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.440
To actually tie all the points together,

361
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.512
I just put chapters helping the individual

362
00:17:07.512 --> 00:17:11.849
expand their own level of imagination.

363
00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:19.593
In medical science there's a new operation that's done,

364
00:17:19.593 --> 00:17:22.192
it's called the still point.

365
00:17:22.192 --> 00:17:23.527
<v Voiceover>The still point?</v>

366
00:17:23.527 --> 00:17:24.261
<v ->Yeah.</v>

367
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:25.429
<v Voiceover>What is that?</v>

368
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:27.063
<v ->It's an operation they do when you have</v>

369
00:17:27.063 --> 00:17:29.432
a blood vessel exploding in your head,

370
00:17:29.432 --> 00:17:33.837
and they literally bring your body temperature down to 58.

371
00:17:33.837 --> 00:17:36.573
They stop your brainwaves and your heart,

372
00:17:36.573 --> 00:17:38.242
and the drain blood from your body

373
00:17:38.242 --> 00:17:41.245
so there's no pressure on the vessel.

374
00:17:41.245 --> 00:17:42.779
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

375
00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:44.047
<v ->They fix the vessel,</v>

376
00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:46.116
they reintroduce everything.

377
00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:48.652
You're literally beyond dead, technically.

378
00:17:48.652 --> 00:17:50.087
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

379
00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:52.990
<v ->They drain the blood, your body temperature,</v>

380
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.058
no brainwaves, no heart waves,

381
00:17:55.058 --> 00:17:59.362
and then people reconstitute and come back.

382
00:17:59.362 --> 00:18:01.265
Most of them, when they come back,

383
00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:03.633
the ones that survive, which is the majority of them --

384
00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:05.503
<v Voiceover>The majority truly survive those?</v>

385
00:18:05.503 --> 00:18:08.638
<v ->Yes, and there's several good books on the subject.</v>

386
00:18:08.638 --> 00:18:11.041
Actually down in Arizona is where they perform this

387
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:12.609
most of the time.

388
00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:15.245
Literally, these people when they come back

389
00:18:15.245 --> 00:18:17.882
talk about watching the operation.

390
00:18:17.882 --> 00:18:20.817
The body is totally

391
00:18:20.817 --> 00:18:22.686
no electrical activity.

392
00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.855
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

393
00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:27.691
<v ->They come back into the physical body.</v>

394
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:31.962
It speaks loudly about this other aspect of ourself.

395
00:18:33.252 --> 00:18:35.565
This non-local witnessing aspect

396
00:18:35.565 --> 00:18:38.702
that we're understanding now from consciousness research,

397
00:18:40.222 --> 00:18:42.539
that the ancients might call your soul.

398
00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.507
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

399
00:18:44.507 --> 00:18:48.946
<v ->This aspect, when you align that with your heart</v>

400
00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:50.914
and the egoic self,

401
00:18:50.914 --> 00:18:53.684
creates a unique attunement,

402
00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:55.585
attunement that you can actually see

403
00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:57.554
in the balance between the parasympathetic

404
00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.056
and the sympathetic.

405
00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:00.691
You can see in the immune system.

406
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:01.992
You can see in the DNA.

407
00:19:01.992 --> 00:19:04.127
You can see in the whole broad range

408
00:19:04.127 --> 00:19:07.464
of physical attributes and characteristics.

409
00:19:07.464 --> 00:19:11.725
You feel joy or at peace.

410
00:19:12.755 --> 00:19:14.171
<v Voiceover>It does seem though,</v>

411
00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:16.006
that that procedure's a little dicey.

412
00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:18.242
<v ->It's very dicey, it's a last --</v>

413
00:19:18.242 --> 00:19:20.544
<v Voiceover>It's a ...</v>
<v ->You're going to die.</v>

414
00:19:20.544 --> 00:19:24.014
<v Voiceover>It's a choice as to whether you wish to have</v>

415
00:19:24.014 --> 00:19:27.651
what is called the near death experience or not (laughs).

416
00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:31.656
I suppose it's better than the alternative.

417
00:19:31.656 --> 00:19:33.624
Quite interesting.

418
00:19:33.624 --> 00:19:35.592
Depending on the intention of that soul,

419
00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:36.928
they do or don't come back.

420
00:19:36.928 --> 00:19:37.894
<v ->Right.</v>

421
00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:39.396
<v Voiceover>Depending on what's appropriate</v>

422
00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:41.097
for its future development and growth.

423
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:41.932
<v ->Not only that,</v>

424
00:19:41.932 --> 00:19:44.769
but they'll actually tell about what happened in the room

425
00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:46.712
or what happened up on the second floor of the hospital.

426
00:19:46.712 --> 00:19:48.305
<v Voiceover>Yes, as witnessing, right.</v>

427
00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:50.707
<v ->It's an out of body experience,</v>

428
00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:53.044
but literally the body,

429
00:19:53.044 --> 00:19:55.579
there's no brainwaves and the heart is stopped

430
00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:58.782
and the blood is literally drained from the body

431
00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:02.218
so they can create this opportunity to fix.

432
00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:05.556
This operation doesn't happen in 10 minutes.

433
00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:08.224
We're talking about an hour and a half

434
00:20:08.224 --> 00:20:10.828
of being in this state or longer.

435
00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:12.463
<v Voiceover>Right, amazing.</v>

436
00:20:12.463 --> 00:20:16.927
That animating force, the soul force,

437
00:20:16.927 --> 00:20:20.370
as it joins back with the body then you restore life.

438
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.806
Without that, you don't have life anyway.

439
00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:24.675
<v ->Right.</v>

440
00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:27.744
<v Voiceover>Continue on, then.</v>

441
00:20:27.744 --> 00:20:31.148
You have the table of contents now,

442
00:20:31.148 --> 00:20:33.551
and you've had your epiphany.

443
00:20:33.551 --> 00:20:34.751
<v ->Right.</v>

444
00:20:34.751 --> 00:20:36.186
<v Voiceover>You're now going to begin</v>

445
00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:39.823
taking compassion on, on a new level of understanding.

446
00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:44.628
How did the subject of the shroud feed into all of this?

447
00:20:46.988 --> 00:20:50.634
<v ->If you watch any of the Shroud of Turin programs on TV,</v>

448
00:20:50.634 --> 00:20:52.136
the Discovery Channel,

449
00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:55.905
what you'll see there is a sanitized version

450
00:20:55.905 --> 00:21:00.243
of what the real, true researchers into the subject know.

451
00:21:00.243 --> 00:21:04.781
If the people that actually researched the object

452
00:21:06.471 --> 00:21:09.019
have come to these conclusions about the object,

453
00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.520
there's a lot of science.

454
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.457
First off, in 1973

455
00:21:14.457 --> 00:21:17.961
a group took a photo of the shroud

456
00:21:17.961 --> 00:21:20.897
and they took it and they put it through a NASA device

457
00:21:20.897 --> 00:21:23.533
called a VP8 analyzer,

458
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.404
and this picture when it went through the analyzer,

459
00:21:27.404 --> 00:21:30.474
generated a 3D image

460
00:21:30.474 --> 00:21:33.243
of the body laying under the cloth.

461
00:21:33.243 --> 00:21:34.645
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

462
00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:38.615
<v ->No other painting or picture or object</v>

463
00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:40.650
single picture does that.

464
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.257
This tool was created to take pictures from outer space

465
00:21:44.257 --> 00:21:47.958
and generate topography.

466
00:21:49.188 --> 00:21:51.595
When that happened, it generated a lot of interest

467
00:21:51.595 --> 00:21:53.630
in the scientific community.

468
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.601
In 1978, a group that was called

469
00:21:57.601 --> 00:22:00.770
the Shroud of Turin research project,

470
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.006
about 24 people went over

471
00:22:03.006 --> 00:22:07.244
and did all sorts of experimentation.

472
00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:09.913
Photos, they took sticky tape.

473
00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:13.149
They did an enormous amount of research

474
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:15.868
in about a five day period.

475
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:19.789
All that research that they took

476
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:23.860
has been studied and studied and studied.

477
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.898
They understand how the image was placed

478
00:22:27.898 --> 00:22:31.001
in terms of the medium.

479
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:33.036
It was light or energy.

480
00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:34.938
There's a starch on it,

481
00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:36.939
and this starch literally embedded

482
00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:39.976
in some unique, perfect way the image

483
00:22:39.976 --> 00:22:42.146
in perfect resolution.

484
00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:45.549
The camera right now is capturing me in perfect resolution

485
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:47.183
in a certain plane.

486
00:22:47.183 --> 00:22:49.119
The Shroud of Turin is in perfect resolution,

487
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:51.254
the front and the back,

488
00:22:51.254 --> 00:22:54.624
even though this cloth was laying over this body.

489
00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:58.362
There were coins on the eyes, flowers around the head,

490
00:22:58.362 --> 00:23:00.764
there's pollen dust, there's rock dust,

491
00:23:00.764 --> 00:23:03.266
there's blood, there's forensic evidence.

492
00:23:03.266 --> 00:23:05.869
There's a wealth of material

493
00:23:05.869 --> 00:23:09.339
and when you look at the whole body of material,

494
00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:11.441
it's pretty consistent that this object

495
00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:14.357
came from the first century

496
00:23:14.357 --> 00:23:19.249
and that a man died a very violent, torturous death

497
00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:22.686
inside the cloth.

498
00:23:22.686 --> 00:23:26.123
The forensic evidence is clear on that.

499
00:23:26.123 --> 00:23:30.093
How did a man,

500
00:23:30.093 --> 00:23:32.763
because we can't do it today,

501
00:23:32.763 --> 00:23:36.399
and how come it hasn't been done several time since then?

502
00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:38.401
Even if it was done in the 1300s,

503
00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:42.439
how come it hasn't been done again and again and again?

504
00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:46.109
Produce an image on a cloth

505
00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:49.245
and the image is in negative.

506
00:23:49.245 --> 00:23:50.881
It's not even in positive.

507
00:23:50.881 --> 00:23:54.418
It wasn't until like 1898,

508
00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:56.953
when a photographer took the first picture of it,

509
00:23:56.953 --> 00:24:00.590
and when he was developing the picture in his dark room,

510
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:05.178
saw the actual image arise in the negative.

511
00:24:06.663 --> 00:24:09.566
It's an incredible, incredible thing.

512
00:24:09.566 --> 00:24:12.703
For me personally, after researching it,

513
00:24:12.703 --> 00:24:16.973
the shroud is intended for this period of time.

514
00:24:19.253 --> 00:24:22.345
The message that's embedded in those,

515
00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:25.615
you know the old saying, "A picture tells 1,000 words,"

516
00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:27.717
or whatever it is, something like that,

517
00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:31.187
the shroud has no words in it.

518
00:24:31.187 --> 00:24:33.323
It's an image of a man

519
00:24:33.323 --> 00:24:36.092
laying in the posture of death

520
00:24:36.092 --> 00:24:39.029
and this tradition tells us that man

521
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:42.632
at that moment ascended.

522
00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:45.202
That's what it says.

523
00:24:45.202 --> 00:24:48.872
There's a lot of other documentation and history

524
00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:50.273
that you can look into,

525
00:24:50.273 --> 00:24:53.243
but coming back to just the facts on the shroud,

526
00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:56.913
the shroud itself when you look at the science

527
00:24:56.913 --> 00:24:59.749
with the tools we have today,

528
00:24:59.749 --> 00:25:02.252
the individual who created it

529
00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:04.988
left it for those that would have the tools,

530
00:25:04.988 --> 00:25:06.825
first off, to see the real image,

531
00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.559
the cameras, right?
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

532
00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:11.961
<v ->You can't forge all the forensic evidence</v>

533
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:13.497
and all the material on there.

534
00:25:13.497 --> 00:25:16.048
It's impossible.

535
00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:19.102
The shroud's story is the greatest mystery.

536
00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:22.172
I've stayed a night inside the Great Pyramid of Giza,

537
00:25:22.172 --> 00:25:24.240
I've gone to the pit

538
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.244
and it's an amazing mystery of our planet,

539
00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:31.181
but the shroud is just beyond that.

540
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:35.218
What it points to, the testament that it tells us

541
00:25:35.218 --> 00:25:37.487
for this time and place

542
00:25:37.487 --> 00:25:39.956
is that within each individual

543
00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:43.059
we have the ability to transcend

544
00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:47.780
this level of existence using awareness.

545
00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:54.003
Having a level of remembrance of our true self.

546
00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:55.872
That's all it really is.

547
00:25:55.872 --> 00:26:00.276
From the ancient sub Indian continent,

548
00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:04.748
they have traditions that talk to this directly,

549
00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:07.951
a science based on love and kindness

550
00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:10.253
and compassion and attunement

551
00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:13.090
that ends with a great completion.

552
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.291
It's called the rainbow body attainment,

553
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:16.959
the wisdom body attainment.

554
00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:18.962
It's called the golden body.

555
00:26:18.962 --> 00:26:23.439
Literally for various levels of attainment,

556
00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:27.186
the body will disappear,

557
00:26:28.538 --> 00:26:31.942
or it will become uncorruptible.

558
00:26:31.942 --> 00:26:34.745
<v Voiceover>There are examples of this, well known.</v>

559
00:26:34.745 --> 00:26:36.754
<v ->Recent ones.</v>

560
00:26:36.754 --> 00:26:38.449
<v Voiceover>Talk about those.</v>

561
00:26:38.449 --> 00:26:42.318
<v ->There was a monk that passed away over in New Jersey.</v>

562
00:26:42.318 --> 00:26:44.822
He was a rinpoche.

563
00:26:44.822 --> 00:26:47.056
I think this was in the year 2001.

564
00:26:47.056 --> 00:26:49.359
I might have the year wrong, but I think 2001.

565
00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:50.927
They wanted to do a puja,

566
00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:52.996
they wanted to burn the body there.

567
00:26:52.996 --> 00:26:55.867
They had to get everybody involved,

568
00:26:55.867 --> 00:27:00.286
the city officials, the fire officials and people like this.

569
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.373
After four days, on the fifth day

570
00:27:03.373 --> 00:27:04.874
the body started to corrupt,

571
00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:07.410
but it was five days it was in perfect condition,

572
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.778
no sign of corruption.

573
00:27:08.778 --> 00:27:11.615
The coroner and everybody said, "Nope, this man is dead."

574
00:27:11.615 --> 00:27:13.383
Then they burned the body.

575
00:27:13.383 --> 00:27:17.053
How did a person like Aurobindo and Yogananda

576
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:20.136
and many other examples

577
00:27:20.136 --> 00:27:24.861
leave this plane of existence and their body not corrupt?

578
00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:29.533
There's one really wonderful example over in Thailand.

579
00:27:29.533 --> 00:27:32.836
A monk passed away in '78.

580
00:27:32.836 --> 00:27:35.839
He's still sitting in jungles of Thailand,

581
00:27:35.839 --> 00:27:38.975
cross legged, wearing sun glasses today.

582
00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:43.347
<v Voiceover>(laughs) These are just amazing examples.</v>

583
00:27:43.347 --> 00:27:46.116
<v ->Right, I mean it's just, how?</v>

584
00:27:46.116 --> 00:27:47.550
<v Voiceover>How, right.</v>

585
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.487
<v ->It's there, it's physically there.</v>

586
00:27:50.487 --> 00:27:53.139
It's not like you say it's a mystery

587
00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:54.991
that you have to have faith on.

588
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:56.993
You can look at it, you can measure it.

589
00:27:56.993 --> 00:27:58.695
The traveling mummy roadshow,

590
00:27:58.695 --> 00:28:01.631
I think it was on Discovery, maybe National Geographic,

591
00:28:01.631 --> 00:28:03.232
one of these stations.

592
00:28:03.232 --> 00:28:04.767
They went and they took this body

593
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.168
and they did a CAT scan of it.

594
00:28:06.168 --> 00:28:08.370
They thought he had been mummified.

595
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.775
They said, "No, he's still got his food in his belly."

596
00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:14.143
That was '78.

597
00:28:14.143 --> 00:28:15.779
It's not a shrine, you can go see.

598
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:17.313
<v Voiceover>That's a long digestive cycle.</v>

599
00:28:17.313 --> 00:28:19.750
<v ->He's also in the jungles where you don't last long.</v>

600
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.384
<v Voiceover>Right, exactly.</v>

601
00:28:21.384 --> 00:28:25.421
<v ->You dissolve pretty quick back to dust.</v>

602
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:30.209
They have a science that describes ascension.

603
00:28:31.962 --> 00:28:34.698
It's pretty straightforward.

604
00:28:34.698 --> 00:28:37.467
If you do this, this, and this,

605
00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:39.168
these are the goals

606
00:28:39.168 --> 00:28:40.570
and at the highest level,

607
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.640
you have the opportunity to attain this.

608
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.237
Jesus and many other prophets have said the same thing

609
00:28:48.237 --> 00:28:50.547
and many saints since.

610
00:28:50.547 --> 00:28:52.749
Saint Francis, Saint Clare.

611
00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:55.651
The list goes on and on.

612
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:57.620
Even Mother Teresa.

613
00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.022
<v Voiceover>The messages are always the same, very simple.</v>

614
00:29:00.022 --> 00:29:02.325
Love thy brother as thyself.

615
00:29:02.325 --> 00:29:06.229
<v ->The one in Matthew that I used in the book a lot,</v>

616
00:29:06.229 --> 00:29:09.899
when he was asked,

617
00:29:09.899 --> 00:29:13.236
"Teacher, what is the greatest commandment?"

618
00:29:13.236 --> 00:29:16.272
He literally just says it the way it really is.

619
00:29:16.272 --> 00:29:19.776
"Love your God with all your heart,

620
00:29:19.776 --> 00:29:22.645
"your soul, and your mind.

621
00:29:22.645 --> 00:29:27.116
"The second thing to do is love your neighbor as yourself."

622
00:29:27.116 --> 00:29:30.754
The golden rule, and that's all there is to it.

623
00:29:30.754 --> 00:29:35.214
That's really the bottom line to creating this.

624
00:29:35.214 --> 00:29:38.694
The funny thing is now we're showing

625
00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:40.263
with science and medical science

626
00:29:40.263 --> 00:29:42.365
the value to you personally,

627
00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:46.436
the well being to you personally by doing that.

628
00:29:46.436 --> 00:29:49.572
That, I think, is the message I'm trying to share,

629
00:29:49.572 --> 00:29:53.519
is that by having altruism, feeling compassion,

630
00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:58.431
compassion is the only selfless emotion.

631
00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:03.586
All other emotions are rooted in the egoic self.

632
00:30:03.586 --> 00:30:06.636
They are rooted in self.

633
00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:09.759
Compassion is selflessness,

634
00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:14.714
and when you feel that, magic happens in the body.

635
00:30:16.032 --> 00:30:19.535
It's a miracle but it's just the way the design is.

636
00:30:19.535 --> 00:30:22.505
The design sets it up so that when you create this,

637
00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:25.608
your heart is a gland, it produce certain things,

638
00:30:25.608 --> 00:30:28.178
transmissions happen.

639
00:30:28.178 --> 00:30:32.349
It's truly magical what happens,

640
00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:34.751
even at the level of the cell.

641
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:37.420
Bruce Lipton, I know you've interviewed him.

642
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.291
The environment that's produced in the physical body

643
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:42.958
and around each cell,

644
00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:47.097
when you feel all these wonderful godlike emotions,

645
00:30:47.097 --> 00:30:50.200
humility, gratitude,

646
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.369
they set off changes within your body.

647
00:30:53.369 --> 00:30:55.138
Physical changes.

648
00:30:55.138 --> 00:30:56.672
<v Voiceover>I wanted to get to that part.</v>

649
00:30:56.672 --> 00:30:58.742
DNA, changes in the DNA.

650
00:30:58.742 --> 00:31:01.944
You also extrapolate this about into the whole area

651
00:31:01.944 --> 00:31:03.913
of longevity, even.

652
00:31:03.913 --> 00:31:06.515
How does this all fit?

653
00:31:06.515 --> 00:31:08.717
<v ->When you feel open and receptive,</v>

654
00:31:08.717 --> 00:31:11.254
loving, caring,

655
00:31:11.254 --> 00:31:13.557
your body,

656
00:31:13.557 --> 00:31:16.125
the wave form of your body

657
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:18.328
produces a certain geometry.

658
00:31:18.328 --> 00:31:20.263
It expands.

659
00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:25.134
If I was to see you electrically right now,

660
00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:29.252
which is the phenomena that's maintaining you in 3D space,

661
00:31:29.252 --> 00:31:33.076
your wave form looks like a Taurus, a doughnut.

662
00:31:33.076 --> 00:31:35.678
It looks like an apple,

663
00:31:35.678 --> 00:31:40.015
and that modulates slightly with each beat of your heart.

664
00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:42.520
When you feel open receptivity,

665
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.721
the geometry of that wave form

666
00:31:44.721 --> 00:31:46.957
that goes way out from your body,

667
00:31:46.957 --> 00:31:50.260
you carry this thing at least 10 feet out,

668
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.862
measurably from your body,

669
00:31:52.862 --> 00:31:56.799
that wave form, through resonance,

670
00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.767
touches all your cells.

671
00:31:58.767 --> 00:32:00.202
It communicates.

672
00:32:00.202 --> 00:32:03.106
It communicates acoustically through the heart,

673
00:32:03.106 --> 00:32:04.841
chemically through the heart,

674
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:06.709
neurotransmitters, hormones.

675
00:32:06.709 --> 00:32:10.913
It communicates through the acoustic pressure waves

676
00:32:10.913 --> 00:32:12.348
that are created,

677
00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:14.149
and electrically, the signalling,

678
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:18.354
and ions are generated through the nervous system.

679
00:32:18.354 --> 00:32:22.191
All these tell the body (sighs).

680
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:25.161
The DNA is just like a slinky.

681
00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:27.596
When you feel expanded, it's expanded

682
00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:29.865
and when you feel contracted, it's contracted.

683
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:32.735
When your wave form is expanded, your DNA is expanded

684
00:32:32.735 --> 00:32:34.404
and when your DNA expands,

685
00:32:34.404 --> 00:32:38.340
it allows different codons to be accessed.

686
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.299
It allows different chemical structures to be created,

687
00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:46.315
different proteins to be created.

688
00:32:46.315 --> 00:32:49.552
It changes literally the availability

689
00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:53.856
of shifting radically your cells and your body structure,

690
00:32:53.856 --> 00:32:56.059
the way the nervous system works.

691
00:32:56.059 --> 00:33:00.162
We tested many different yogis

692
00:33:00.162 --> 00:33:03.700
and they could do things.

693
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.804
Have pain and not show it.

694
00:33:07.804 --> 00:33:10.473
It wasn't just mind over matter.

695
00:33:10.473 --> 00:33:13.275
They literally changed the way

696
00:33:13.275 --> 00:33:15.711
the nerves move through the body.

697
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:18.380
They said that's not reality to them.

698
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.451
They change their story.

699
00:33:21.451 --> 00:33:23.753
Their story is different than the story that I have

700
00:33:23.753 --> 00:33:25.128
right now, maybe.

701
00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:26.488
If I prick my finger, it hurts.

702
00:33:26.488 --> 00:33:27.847
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

703
00:33:27.847 --> 00:33:31.226
<v ->Their story is different, so their reality is different.</v>

704
00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:34.029
When they're coming from the soul level of perspective,

705
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:36.766
knowing their eternity,

706
00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:39.502
it doesn't have the same value, importance,

707
00:33:39.502 --> 00:33:42.939
to protect everything and stay contracted.

708
00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:45.241
Survival mode.

709
00:33:45.241 --> 00:33:49.345
When we feel like we have to survive, we contract.

710
00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:52.715
That changes literally,

711
00:33:52.715 --> 00:33:55.617
I can't express how radically different,

712
00:33:55.617 --> 00:33:56.986
your immune system,

713
00:33:56.986 --> 00:34:00.323
everything alters when you feel contracted.

714
00:34:00.323 --> 00:34:02.364
When you feel expanded and relaxed,

715
00:34:02.364 --> 00:34:04.260
open, receptive,

716
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.531
which is the signature for love and kindness, caring,

717
00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:10.999
that's what the heart's music looks like.

718
00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:13.436
If you feel something for a child,

719
00:34:13.436 --> 00:34:17.145
that's why the Madonna and child is a symbol,

720
00:34:17.145 --> 00:34:20.574
because when you feel that level of caring

721
00:34:20.574 --> 00:34:22.244
that you would feel for a child

722
00:34:22.244 --> 00:34:24.613
like a mother would feel for a child,

723
00:34:24.613 --> 00:34:26.615
for another soul,

724
00:34:26.615 --> 00:34:29.752
that's level one compassion.

725
00:34:29.752 --> 00:34:32.976
When you've awakened to your true nature,

726
00:34:32.976 --> 00:34:35.491
and you're coming from that place,

727
00:34:35.491 --> 00:34:36.892
then you know it.

728
00:34:36.892 --> 00:34:39.595
You've experientially know that reality.

729
00:34:39.595 --> 00:34:42.632
When you know that reality deeply,

730
00:34:42.632 --> 00:34:45.101
you know that you're one person.

731
00:34:45.101 --> 00:34:47.470
You feel deeply the suffering.

732
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:51.673
Sympathy is when I feel for you.

733
00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:54.480
Compassion is when I feel as you.

734
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.346
It's different.

735
00:34:56.346 --> 00:34:58.080
It's a very different state.

736
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.751
That's the optimum and the idealized state.

737
00:35:00.751 --> 00:35:04.020
<v Voiceover>This is really, all of your work is based on</v>

738
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.458
our understanding the true value of compassion

739
00:35:08.458 --> 00:35:11.059
and all of the documentation and everything you did

740
00:35:11.059 --> 00:35:12.930
in this book The Silent Gospel

741
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.864
is really toward that end

742
00:35:14.864 --> 00:35:18.969
and leading us on a path or a journey through

743
00:35:18.969 --> 00:35:22.104
in this case a lot of scientific inquiry

744
00:35:22.104 --> 00:35:25.074
in addition to mystical understandings

745
00:35:25.074 --> 00:35:28.010
to the understanding of the value of compassion

746
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.913
and what it brings to every cell in our body.

747
00:35:30.913 --> 00:35:33.482
<v ->It was originally in the mystical traditions,</v>

748
00:35:33.482 --> 00:35:36.986
the spiritual traditions, religious traditions.

749
00:35:36.986 --> 00:35:38.921
Jesus, when He was dying,

750
00:35:38.921 --> 00:35:42.024
forgave the guys that were killing Him.

751
00:35:42.024 --> 00:35:43.792
That level of compassion,

752
00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:47.297
that level of knowing the Truth,

753
00:35:47.297 --> 00:35:49.800
big T, Truth,

754
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.702
changes the way you perceive things.

755
00:35:52.702 --> 00:35:57.409
It opens your body to opportunities

756
00:35:57.409 --> 00:35:59.676
that are different,

757
00:35:59.676 --> 00:36:03.035
and when you hit a certain level

758
00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:08.035
of surrendering your identity's self, I,

759
00:36:10.586 --> 00:36:12.922
then those are the things like I said before

760
00:36:12.922 --> 00:36:15.925
that are anchoring this in physicality.

761
00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:18.395
If you surrender it, what holds it in place?

762
00:36:18.395 --> 00:36:20.129
It dissolves.

763
00:36:20.129 --> 00:36:22.832
It dissolves in a blinding flash.

764
00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:24.500
It's the easiest way to understand ascension --

765
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.469
<v Voiceover>That's the Shroud of Turin.</v>

766
00:36:26.469 --> 00:36:30.073
<v ->Right, it's a phase transition.</v>

767
00:36:30.073 --> 00:36:32.174
When awareness shifts,

768
00:36:32.174 --> 00:36:34.843
literally form shifts,

769
00:36:34.843 --> 00:36:36.879
and when the form shifts to the place

770
00:36:36.879 --> 00:36:41.129
where it relinquishes all level of identity,

771
00:36:41.129 --> 00:36:42.784
it surrenders.

772
00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:44.387
It has submission.

773
00:36:44.387 --> 00:36:46.823
Western culture, the best term is allowing.

774
00:36:46.823 --> 00:36:48.858
Receptive allowing.

775
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:50.459
We use the term surrender.

776
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:52.261
A lot of us in the West get our backs up,

777
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:54.030
we don't like that.

778
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.733
Anyway, when you get to that level of allowing,

779
00:36:57.733 --> 00:37:01.938
I find that it really, really changes

780
00:37:03.068 --> 00:37:06.675
the physicality to a place where you can

781
00:37:08.355 --> 00:37:12.381
let go of form.

782
00:37:12.381 --> 00:37:15.784
My sense is right now from the science of it,

783
00:37:15.784 --> 00:37:20.289
is that we live in a place where there's multi dimensions.

784
00:37:21.399 --> 00:37:25.194
Existence changes from this existence

785
00:37:25.194 --> 00:37:27.496
to another existence,

786
00:37:27.496 --> 00:37:29.532
but you can only get to that existence

787
00:37:29.532 --> 00:37:32.369
when you're finished with this existence.

788
00:37:32.369 --> 00:37:36.805
You have to surrender it all back to divinity,

789
00:37:36.805 --> 00:37:39.676
which is your true self.

790
00:37:39.676 --> 00:37:41.410
You are divinity.

791
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.045
(peaceful music)

792
00:37:43.045 --> 00:37:45.014
