00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:03.175
<v ->One of the primary problems for Judeo-Christian</v>

2
00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:05.907
theologians is the disturbing reality that both

3
00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:09.107
King David and King Solomon, the most celebrated kings

4
00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:12.877
of Judaic history, cannot be found in the historical record.

5
00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:14.157
How can this be?

6
00:00:14.457 --> 00:00:17.491
How could the wealthy and influential empires suddenly

7
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.957
disappear from the archaeological record?

8
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:22.311
Historian Ralph Ellis, author of

9
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:25.723
Jesus, Last of the Pharaohs and other intriguing books,

10
00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:28.007
says that the lack of evidence may simply be a

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.343
matter of looking in the wrong place.

12
00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:32.718
His research into ancient texts through the science of

13
00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:36.190
etymology has led him to some original conclusions.

14
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.121
Perhaps the most startling is that the Judaic culture

15
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.653
may have stemmed from the Hyksos line of Egyptian pharaohs.

16
00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:47.653 line:15% 
(soft, fast music)

17
00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:54.213
To understand the genesis of all of this incredible work

18
00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:57.776
you've done, we really have to understand that it's all

19
00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:01.936
from ancient times until now, is a matter of interpretation

20
00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.944
and really, a deep understanding of etymology

21
00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:09.168
is important to all of this, as you have taken it upon

22
00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:12.944
yourself to learn ancient Egyptian and Hebrew to the extent,

23
00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:15.184
you know a lot of the words and can do some of your own

24
00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:17.424
interpretation quite easily, and it starts

25
00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.428
putting a different spin to the story.

26
00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:21.560
And speaking of spins to the story,

27
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.844
can you set us up with an understanding of what

28
00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:25.488
the pesher technique is and then

29
00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:27.364
we're going to get into the juicy stuff.

30
00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:30.060
<v ->Okay, well the pesher technique is just</v>

31
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.622
the interpretation of the text,

32
00:01:34.622 --> 00:01:36.112
assuming effectively

33
00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:39.555
that most of the texts are written as parables

34
00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.032
and so there are deeper meanings within the text.

35
00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:46.054
I think sometimes it's easy to see too much

36
00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:48.164
into these texts

37
00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:49.884
and so you have to be very careful about

38
00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:52.675
how deeply you take it, and I think some of the books

39
00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:53.916
that have been written have taken

40
00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:56.463
the pesher technique rather too far.

41
00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:01.571
But I do use a sort of similar technique in that I'm

42
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:04.174
retranslating, effectively,

43
00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.744
what the texts are actually saying.

44
00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:11.216
So, just for an example, in the Bible,

45
00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:16.144
it talks about Abraham having 318 servants,

46
00:02:16.144 --> 00:02:18.127
which might sound unusual because he

47
00:02:18.127 --> 00:02:19.535
was supposed to be a shepherd, you know.

48
00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.651
Why would a shepherd have 318 servants?

49
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.075
(Regina laughs)

50
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.037
But if you look into Josephus, and I used Josephus,

51
00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:30.735
or Josephus as they tend to say in America,

52
00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:33.871
if you look into his version of the same text

53
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:38.871
he clearly says that Abraham had 318 army officers.

54
00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:44.559
So, a very small change but then it makes a very big change

55
00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.476
in the understanding of that particular text.

56
00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:51.771
What it means, of course, is that Abraham had

57
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:55.266
an army of about 30,000 people, so he must have

58
00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.743
been very influential, very powerful.

59
00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.384
He must have been a king.

60
00:02:59.384 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Regina>But, if you're reading the most common versions</v>

61
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.615
of the Bible today, you would come away thinking that

62
00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:09.050
all of these great characters, throughout biblical history

63
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.604
in particular, are basically shepherds.

64
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:12.760
<v ->Yes.</v>

65
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.704
<v Regina>And it's a very pastoral idyllic moral</v>

66
00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:17.120
kind of scenario.
<v Ralph>Very much so.</v>

67
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.580
<v Regina>That they're passing on through these writings</v>

68
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.170
and in fact, what you're relaying is something much richer

69
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.586
because you're saying, "Why is it that some of these

70
00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.442
"most well-known people throughout the traditions

71
00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:32.986
"of Judaism, Christianity, and the Islamic faith

72
00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:36.418
"all have the same stories, essentially have the same root

73
00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:40.130
"to the same names, if they were shepherds?"

74
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.070
<v ->Yes.</v>

75
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.283
<v Regina>And so they're powerful people of the day.</v>

76
00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:44.488
Why can't you find them as biblical characters

77
00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:45.312
throughout history?

78
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:46.828
So, let's launch right in.

79
00:03:46.828 --> 00:03:48.529
Let's talk about Abraham.

80
00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:51.931
<v ->Yes, well there you come to one of</v>

81
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.231
the nubs of the whole story.

82
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:57.350
They were called in the Bible, as we know, shepherds.

83
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.231
Why were they called shepherds?

84
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.191
Well, the reason, I believe,

85
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:03.631
is because they were the shepherd kings,

86
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.192
and there was a line of pharaohs within Egypt

87
00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:09.397
who are known as the Hyksos, or the Hyksos,

88
00:04:09.397 --> 00:04:11.817
who were known as the shepherd kings

89
00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:15.457
and that is where the term shepherd comes from.

90
00:04:15.457 --> 00:04:17.797
And so Abraham was not a shepherd.

91
00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:20.264
He had 318 army officers.

92
00:04:20.264 --> 00:04:21.823
<v Regina>Meaning a vast army.</v>

93
00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:23.530
<v ->A vast army of at least 30,000 people.</v>

94
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.719
<v Regina>Underneath these officers.</v>

95
00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.515
<v ->So he was a shepherd king, and we know who</v>

96
00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:30.182
the shepherd kings were.

97
00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:31.802
They were the Hyksos.

98
00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:35.582
And they were the people who controlled Lower Egypt.

99
00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:38.239
That's the northern half of Egypt.

100
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.239
Egypt was quite traditionally divided

101
00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:44.511
between north and south quite on a number of occasions.

102
00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:46.144
It wasn't always united.

103
00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:50.623
And so, you had a southern pharaoh and a northern pharaoh.

104
00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:55.623
And during the Hyksos period, again, we had two pharaohs

105
00:04:55.624 --> 00:04:59.087
and we had this line of shepherd kings in the north

106
00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:01.802
and this is where I think the story comes from.

107
00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.022
And this a presumption that goes back a long way.

108
00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:09.461
Again, if you read Josephus and his history--

109
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:13.222
Now, Josephus was around the first century A.D. and

110
00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:16.362
he wrote a history of the Israelites,

111
00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:20.161
and he actually said that the Israelites were the Hyksos,

112
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:23.433
the Hyksos pharaohs of Lower Egypt.

113
00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:27.930
No one really took up on his assertion there.

114
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.002
It seems to have been forgotten somewhere.

115
00:05:30.002 --> 00:05:34.383
However, if we take what he said as being true,

116
00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:37.342
everything in the Bible suddenly starts to make more sense.

117
00:05:37.342 --> 00:05:39.491
<v Regina>Right, most definitely, and could it have been</v>

118
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:41.953
conveniently forgotten for political reasons?

119
00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:43.169
<v ->I think so.</v>

120
00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.668
I've thought long and hard

121
00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:48.278
about why this should have been done.

122
00:05:49.648 --> 00:05:53.309
But I think the change happened

123
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:57.427
somewhere perhaps during the Babylonian exile.

124
00:05:57.427 --> 00:06:00.087
Obviously, Israel had been destroyed.

125
00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:01.797
The people had been scattered.

126
00:06:01.797 --> 00:06:04.811
They were now in exile in Babylon,

127
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:08.229
and I think they were looking maybe for a scapegoat.

128
00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.717
And there is a section in the Bible which accuses Egypt

129
00:06:11.717 --> 00:06:14.327
of being the root of all evil.

130
00:06:14.327 --> 00:06:16.417
And I think at that point

131
00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.988
there was a separation made between the original

132
00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:21.988
Egyptian history and what became the normal

133
00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:24.824
biblical history saying it all occurred

134
00:06:24.824 --> 00:06:27.409
sort of in Judea, mostly anyway.

135
00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.046
And so there was...

136
00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:34.105
They needed someone to blame, effectively,

137
00:06:34.105 --> 00:06:38.267
and so they adopted this sort of victim status

138
00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:42.235
in order to keep the people together

139
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.525
and forge this new effective religion.

140
00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:51.475
And that became the Judaism that we know today.

141
00:06:51.475 --> 00:06:53.172
<v Regina>Which essentially became what</v>

142
00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:54.992
the Old Testament was based on.

143
00:06:54.992 --> 00:06:59.712
<v ->Yes, but effectively, it was a true history of something</v>

144
00:06:59.712 --> 00:07:02.872
that was completely different, and so we have to look back

145
00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:06.608
through the texts and sort of reinterpret the texts,

146
00:07:06.608 --> 00:07:10.187
trying to see the original Egyptian

147
00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:12.617
historical evidence,

148
00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:17.447
because the Bible as we see it, has somehow

149
00:07:17.447 --> 00:07:20.797
become divorced totally from history.

150
00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:23.245
So here we have a book that is a complete history of

151
00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:26.565
these people, and yet nothing, none of these events,

152
00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:29.102
none of these people, nothing within the Bible,

153
00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:30.774
can be found within the historical record.

154
00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:32.627
<v Regina>Right, which is really quite intriguing.</v>

155
00:07:32.627 --> 00:07:33.820
<v ->Which is very strange.</v>

156
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.121
It's as though the Bible happened on a different planet.

157
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:37.899
But it didn't.

158
00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:40.836
We know where it happened, roughly, and these people

159
00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:44.708
were important, whether it was Abraham,

160
00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:46.568
whether it was King David and King Solomon who

161
00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:49.966
were supposed to be the most influential monarchs

162
00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:53.131
in that area, in that era, and yet they can't be

163
00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:55.852
found in the historical record.

164
00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:58.121
And so the question is, why?

165
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:00.225
<v Regina>And this is where the etymology comes into play.</v>

166
00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:01.194
<v ->Indeed.</v>

167
00:08:01.194 --> 00:08:03.654
<v Regina>So can you start giving us a</v>

168
00:08:03.654 --> 00:08:05.649
maybe a little bit more specific idea of what

169
00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:07.008
you're talking about in terms of

170
00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:10.188
who these players throughout biblical history

171
00:08:10.188 --> 00:08:13.768
may have been in secular history?

172
00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:14.689
<v ->Yes.</v>

173
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:18.176
Well, let's look at the United Monarchy for instance.

174
00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:19.992
That's King David and King Solomon.

175
00:08:19.992 --> 00:08:24.709
As I said, they were hugely influential, very wealthy.

176
00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:29.117
Monarchs came from all over the region to pay them tribute.

177
00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:32.877
And yet they are missing in the historical record.

178
00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:37.581
They've done a lot of archaeology in Judea, in Jerusalem.

179
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:40.492
And the conclusion of Finkelstein,

180
00:08:40.492 --> 00:08:45.303
who's one of the eminent archaeologists of that area,

181
00:08:45.303 --> 00:08:48.920
is that Jerusalem was no more than a village

182
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.697
during this era, and of course he's found no evidence

183
00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.523
for King David and King Solomon,

184
00:08:53.523 --> 00:08:55.264
which is a bit of a problem,

185
00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:56.895
because here we have this story about these

186
00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:59.816
famous kings and they are not there.

187
00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:02.908
And so you've only got two options, really.

188
00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:07.368
Either, as some people maintain, it's all mythology

189
00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:10.568
and this book was completely made up,

190
00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:14.017
or we're looking in the wrong location.

191
00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:16.272
<v Regina>Which is interesting because a lot of people</v>

192
00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:18.978
have become disenfranchised with their religion,

193
00:09:18.978 --> 00:09:22.388
and certainly on fundamental levels have basically,

194
00:09:22.388 --> 00:09:23.448
I think what you're saying,

195
00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:24.894
is throwing the baby out with the bathwater,

196
00:09:24.894 --> 00:09:28.835
that there's an incredibly rich story embedded

197
00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.604
there if you know how to read it.

198
00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:32.510
<v ->Yes.</v>

199
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.770
There are two problems here.

200
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.991
The Israelites have taken back Israel, of course,

201
00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:40.203
and they sent out their archaeologists into the field

202
00:09:40.203 --> 00:09:41.828
and said, "Right.

203
00:09:41.828 --> 00:09:43.469
"We now have the opportunity.

204
00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:45.429
"Go and look for the evidence."

205
00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:47.626
And they can't find it.

206
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:52.374
And so, yes, that is a big problem for Judaism.

207
00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:56.573
So anyway, they cannot find these two influential monarchs

208
00:09:56.573 --> 00:10:00.869
in the historical record, so the alternative, the obvious

209
00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:05.566
alternative was to look elsewhere for these monarchs.

210
00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:07.755
Maybe they were looking in the wrong location.

211
00:10:07.755 --> 00:10:10.182
Maybe the history is there,

212
00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:14.570
but they are looking in the wrong location.

213
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.873
<v Regina>Quite literally?</v>

214
00:10:15.873 --> 00:10:17.333
<v ->Quite, yes, indeed.</v>

215
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.273
So they're looking in Jerusalem.

216
00:10:19.273 --> 00:10:23.593
Perhaps their main city,

217
00:10:23.593 --> 00:10:25.593
their capital city, was not based in Jerusalem.

218
00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:28.101
Maybe it was elsewhere.

219
00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:29.673
<v Regina>This has a lot of implications when you have</v>

220
00:10:29.673 --> 00:10:31.549
all this fighting going on over the Temple,

221
00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:34.665
for example, but we'll talk about that later.

222
00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.801
<v ->Yes, it becomes very political.</v>

223
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:39.462
So anyway, I started looking,

224
00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:43.452
having already looked at the Hyksos pharaohs of Egypt,

225
00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:46.597
having already realized that it was quite possible

226
00:10:46.597 --> 00:10:51.138
that the early Israelites were the Hyksos,

227
00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:54.694
and a critical piece of that evidence was the Exodus.

228
00:10:54.694 --> 00:10:57.992
Now, we all know the Exodus from the biblical story

229
00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:01.374
and we've all been through standard education for

230
00:11:01.374 --> 00:11:04.193
Christianity, maybe Sunday school, et cetera,

231
00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:08.314
but never is it told to us that there was an identical

232
00:11:08.314 --> 00:11:13.314
exodus out of Egypt by the Hyksos pharaohs of Eygpt.

233
00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:18.514
There was a civil war, and so these kings who were known

234
00:11:18.564 --> 00:11:22.707
as shepherds, who were circumcised, who had earrings,

235
00:11:22.707 --> 00:11:26.015
who wore curly sidelocks of hair of course,

236
00:11:26.015 --> 00:11:28.956
standard Egyptian custom,

237
00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:33.345
they had this civil war with the southern Egyptians.

238
00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:36.875
At the same time, there was storms,

239
00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:40.153
darkness, and possibly plagues.

240
00:11:40.153 --> 00:11:43.162
And they were kicked out of Egypt.

241
00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:47.479
They started from Pi-Ramesses in northern Egypt and

242
00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:52.230
about half a million people went on an exodus to Jerusalem.

243
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.407
<v Regina>Sounding very familiar</v>

244
00:11:54.407 --> 00:11:55.723
from my Sunday school classes.

245
00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:56.856
<v ->This is not biblical history.</v>

246
00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:58.012
This is real history,

247
00:11:58.012 --> 00:12:00.715
and this comes from the texts of Egypt.

248
00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:03.950
It comes from Manetho and some of the other texts,

249
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.040
like the Destruction of Mankind

250
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.470
and other ancient Egyptian texts.

251
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.530
And so this exodus account from history

252
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.106
is almost identical to the biblical Exodus.

253
00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:20.117
The only thing it differs in is the date, which is about

254
00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:24.084
300 years before the accepted era

255
00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:25.763
for the biblical Exodus.

256
00:12:25.763 --> 00:12:29.353
However, we have an identical situation.

257
00:12:30.893 --> 00:12:34.580
And so, it seemed likely to me that the early Israelites

258
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.886
were linked very strongly

259
00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:43.146
with the northern Egyptian Hyksos line

260
00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:46.841
and so if we want to look at later

261
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:50.522
Israelite history, then perhaps somehow that is also

262
00:12:50.522 --> 00:12:53.652
related to the Egyptian line.

263
00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:58.302
<v Regina>Let's bring in, again, some of the evidence</v>

264
00:12:58.302 --> 00:12:59.887
based on etymology.

265
00:12:59.887 --> 00:13:01.068
Let's go back to Egypt.

266
00:13:01.068 --> 00:13:04.404
Let's go back to the Exodus,

267
00:13:04.404 --> 00:13:07.025
or Israel in the Exodus,

268
00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:10.444
and Moses and his role, and who Moses was

269
00:13:10.444 --> 00:13:14.262
as a matter of what you have been discovering.

270
00:13:14.262 --> 00:13:16.677
You found something entirely different.

271
00:13:16.677 --> 00:13:17.573
<v ->Yes.</v>

272
00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:19.433
Now, it does get a little bit complicated

273
00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:22.010
because it's clear from the historical record

274
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.949
that there were two exoduses, not one.

275
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:30.087
And Manetho was an Egyptian historian

276
00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:31.557
of about 300 B.C.

277
00:13:31.557 --> 00:13:34.387
So he was rather closer to this era

278
00:13:34.387 --> 00:13:37.628
than we are, and he said there were two exoduses.

279
00:13:37.628 --> 00:13:39.929
There was the big Exodus, that we've just talked about

280
00:13:39.929 --> 00:13:42.909
which was the Hyksos exodus out of Egypt.

281
00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:47.189
And then he talks about a smaller exodus of

282
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:51.894
maimed priests and lepers, 80,000 of them.

283
00:13:51.894 --> 00:13:55.181
Now, these 80,000 maimed priests and lepers had

284
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.457
been exiled into Middle Egypt on the east

285
00:13:57.457 --> 00:14:00.677
bank of the Nile, to a stone quarry.

286
00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:05.937
And I think in this we can see a history

287
00:14:05.937 --> 00:14:07.844
of the founding of Amarna,

288
00:14:07.844 --> 00:14:09.887
which was the new city of

289
00:14:09.887 --> 00:14:14.373
Pharaoh Akhenaten, the Rebel Pharaoh.

290
00:14:14.373 --> 00:14:16.354
And so his new city would have been a quarry because

291
00:14:16.354 --> 00:14:19.131
they had to construct it from nothing.

292
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.661
Manetho then goes on to say that these people were

293
00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:27.100
eventually pushed out of this area

294
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.441
on the east bank of the Nile,

295
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:34.441
and they went to Avaris, which is up in the Nile Delta,

296
00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:37.409
which is Pi-Ramesses of course, same town.

297
00:14:37.698 --> 00:14:40.974
And so within this,

298
00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:43.473
I think we can see a story

299
00:14:43.473 --> 00:14:46.411
about the abandonment of Amarna because we know that

300
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:49.349
Akhenaten went to Amarna and about 12 years later

301
00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:52.829
his whole empire collapsed,

302
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:54.522
and we don't know what happened to him,

303
00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:57.102
his royal family, Nefertiti,

304
00:14:57.102 --> 00:15:00.642
Kiya, his other wife, all of the main players

305
00:15:00.642 --> 00:15:02.751
are not present.

306
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:04.378
People say they died at Amarna

307
00:15:04.378 --> 00:15:06.577
but there is no evidence for that.

308
00:15:06.577 --> 00:15:10.238
But Manetho seems to be clearly stating

309
00:15:10.238 --> 00:15:14.877
that they actually went on another exodus, a smaller exodus

310
00:15:14.877 --> 00:15:17.998
up to Avaris, and then maybe beyond.

311
00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:22.702
Now, the strange thing is, the brother of Akhenaten

312
00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:26.533
was called Moses, Tuthmosis.

313
00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:29.420
And so we seem to have the two brothers, in the Bible

314
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.159
they're called Aaron and Moses and in

315
00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:37.826
history they were called Akhenaten and Tuthmosis.

316
00:15:37.826 --> 00:15:42.256
And here I think is where we bring in the story about

317
00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:45.111
Moses and his part in the Exodus.

318
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.592
What's happened in the Bible, of course,

319
00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:49.713
is they've taken these two exodus events

320
00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:52.529
and they've combined them

321
00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:55.399
into one story effectively.

322
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.269
But I think it was two exoduses, as Manetho states,

323
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:04.515
and both of these exoduses, of course,

324
00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:07.755
went up to the North,

325
00:16:07.755 --> 00:16:12.516
because eventually these maimed priests

326
00:16:12.516 --> 00:16:14.904
and lepers were kicked out of Avaris as well.

327
00:16:14.904 --> 00:16:16.581
<v Regina>And what do you think the maimed priests</v>

328
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:21.249
and lepers, 80,000 of them you said, actually were?

329
00:16:21.249 --> 00:16:24.538
<v ->Well, Akhenaten, as we know,</v>

330
00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:26.398
was the Rebel Pharaoh.

331
00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:30.927
So he was the pharaoh who tried to institute monotheism

332
00:16:30.927 --> 00:16:32.691
within Egypt.

333
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:35.560
So he was destroying the old gods

334
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.781
and instituting his new god, the Aten.

335
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:41.718
And of course the biblical god is sometimes called

336
00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:46.320
the Aden, so Aten, Aden, it's the same god obviously.

337
00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:50.796
Now, from the Theban

338
00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:53.566
priesthood's perspective,

339
00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:55.986
this would have been very heretical.

340
00:16:55.986 --> 00:17:00.477
And so Akhenaten would have been called the maimed priest

341
00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:01.569
and a leper.

342
00:17:01.569 --> 00:17:02.517
Not a real leper of course.

343
00:17:02.517 --> 00:17:03.596
<v Regina>Meaning an outcast.</v>

344
00:17:03.596 --> 00:17:04.393
<v ->An outcast.</v>

345
00:17:04.393 --> 00:17:09.132
A theological leper, because his new sect was so different

346
00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:13.452
and so confrontational, that it was destroying all

347
00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:15.994
the old traditions, all the old gods.

348
00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:19.270
So yes of course, he would be called the maimed priest

349
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.287
in the theological sense.

350
00:17:20.287 --> 00:17:21.914
<v Regina>So this would have been a group</v>

351
00:17:21.914 --> 00:17:24.203
of religious rebels essentially.

352
00:17:24.203 --> 00:17:25.273
<v ->Effectively.</v>

353
00:17:25.273 --> 00:17:26.592
<v Regina>Effectively led by him.</v>

354
00:17:26.592 --> 00:17:29.746
<v ->Yes, which it was, and we know that from history.</v>

355
00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:31.487
And of course, from the biblical perspective

356
00:17:31.487 --> 00:17:33.363
we have the same story, because Moses

357
00:17:33.363 --> 00:17:34.964
was doing exactly the same thing.

358
00:17:34.964 --> 00:17:36.110
He was the monotheist.

359
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.351
He was in Egypt.

360
00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:40.298
He was of the royal family of course.

361
00:17:40.298 --> 00:17:42.281
He was known as a prince of Egypt,

362
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:46.183
and if you read Josephus,

363
00:17:46.183 --> 00:17:50.023
of course, Moses was also an army commander.

364
00:17:50.023 --> 00:17:52.718
He was a chief army commander within Egypt,

365
00:17:52.718 --> 00:17:55.964
who led the battle against the Ethiopians.

366
00:17:56.596 --> 00:18:00.571
So he was a very important character within Egyptian society

367
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:04.610
and likewise, he was connected with monotheism

368
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.861
and a clash with the establishment within Egypt.

369
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.411
So again, it's the same story.

370
00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:13.437
<v Regina>And this, again,</v>

371
00:18:13.437 --> 00:18:15.257
going back to the root of a lot of

372
00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:18.057
the explanations and the simple pastoral way.

373
00:18:18.057 --> 00:18:21.283
I read a couple of verses

374
00:18:21.283 --> 00:18:24.337
that you had quoted from the Bible

375
00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:28.979
talking about where Jesus had said,

376
00:18:29.745 --> 00:18:32.565
"This knowledge is for--

377
00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:35.605
"Essentially, this knowledge is not for all.

378
00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:37.892
"This knowledge that we pass among ourselves,

379
00:18:37.892 --> 00:18:39.793
"the initiates, is for the few.

380
00:18:39.793 --> 00:18:42.112
"The other knowledge is passed to the people,

381
00:18:42.112 --> 00:18:43.189
"the lay person."

382
00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:44.864
<v ->This is why Jesus always spoke in parables.</v>

383
00:18:44.864 --> 00:18:46.931
Because the church of Jesus

384
00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:50.191
was based on initiation, of course.

385
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:53.100
There were many levels within his church.

386
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.431
And the Disciples and even within the Disciples,

387
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:58.386
there were many levels,

388
00:18:58.386 --> 00:19:01.614
and so we had various initiations into this church.

389
00:19:01.614 --> 00:19:03.777
The laity knew nothing

390
00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:06.519
and they just had the outer layer of the parable.

391
00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.606
<v Regina>Which is essentially what we have today.</v>

392
00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:09.486
<v ->Yes, but...</v>

393
00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:10.707
<v Regina>To a large extent in the Bible.</v>

394
00:19:10.707 --> 00:19:12.181
<v ->I'm thinking more of a sort of masonic type</v>

395
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:14.101
initiation, something...
<v Regina>I was saying</v>

396
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:16.891
the laity part of the Bible that's passed on to us

397
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:19.539
through Sunday school and sermons, by and large,

398
00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:23.506
is the pastoral, simpler version of it.

399
00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:27.301
However, as many books have come out talking about

400
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:31.636
the lost years of Jesus and Jesus's pilgrimage into Egypt

401
00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:34.556
and having learned a lot of the ancient mysteries.

402
00:19:34.556 --> 00:19:37.353
This is being well documented now, so let's pick it up

403
00:19:37.353 --> 00:19:39.187
from there with Jesus.

404
00:19:39.187 --> 00:19:40.623
We'll go into that part of the story

405
00:19:40.623 --> 00:19:43.725
later on, but again, the whole notion of

406
00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.515
the need to separate out the information

407
00:19:45.515 --> 00:19:47.815
because of that elite knowledge.

408
00:19:47.815 --> 00:19:51.971
<v ->Yes, and not only elite knowledge, of course,</v>

409
00:19:51.971 --> 00:19:54.792
and I think they did have some very interesting knowledge.

410
00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:59.368
But also the true history, which they would have known,

411
00:19:59.368 --> 00:20:01.448
which again, the laity did not.

412
00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:03.659
And so again we have this differentiation between--

413
00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Regina>And it keeps people very simple in their union.</v>

414
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.281
<v ->Very much so.</v>

415
00:20:07.281 --> 00:20:08.371
<v Regina>Us against them.</v>

416
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:09.412
<v ->Yes.</v>

417
00:20:09.412 --> 00:20:12.725
It says very clearly, I can't remember the exact quote,

418
00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:16.031
but there was a quote from Jesus within the Bible.

419
00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:19.685
It says most clearly, "This is not a subject

420
00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:20.971
"to be given to the common people.

421
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:21.965
"This is just for--"

422
00:20:21.965 --> 00:20:24.488
<v Regina>That's the one I was referring to, exactly.</v>

423
00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:27.178
<v ->"This is just for you, the Disciples."</v>

424
00:20:27.178 --> 00:20:29.135
And even amongst the Disciples he says well,

425
00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:30.735
you know, "Why can't you understand?"

426
00:20:30.735 --> 00:20:31.694
(laughs)

427
00:20:31.694 --> 00:20:33.876
<v Regina>And if you go back into Egyptology--</v>

428
00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:37.067
And again, this is sprinkled throughout the Bible, even.

429
00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:40.027
If you go back into Egyptology, for example,

430
00:20:40.027 --> 00:20:43.478
there was a much greater understanding of the human

431
00:20:43.478 --> 00:20:46.488
condition as we relate to the cosmos,

432
00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:49.787
and cartography was much better developed at that time.

433
00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:52.823
All of these ancient knowledges which are just now

434
00:20:52.823 --> 00:20:55.726
coming back to light, played prominently,

435
00:20:55.726 --> 00:20:57.567
and then showed up in the Bible,

436
00:20:57.567 --> 00:20:59.656
as I think there was something about

437
00:20:59.656 --> 00:21:04.355
mating between the cows...

438
00:21:04.355 --> 00:21:06.403
Mating between the cows and the--

439
00:21:06.403 --> 00:21:09.898
<v ->Oh yes, from the Old Testament, the cows and the sheep.</v>

440
00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:12.674
We have this wonderful story from the Bible

441
00:21:12.674 --> 00:21:15.655
and this is what I like about my research.

442
00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:18.442
A lot of the Bible doesn't make any sense.

443
00:21:18.442 --> 00:21:20.475
You read it, and you think, "You know, these guys..."

444
00:21:20.475 --> 00:21:21.972
<v Regina>Mating between cows and sheep?</v>

445
00:21:21.972 --> 00:21:24.336
<v ->Yeah, these guys must be on something</v>

446
00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:25.550
to write all this, you know.

447
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.860
What is it all about?

448
00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.637
But when you can look at the text from the right perspective

449
00:21:31.637 --> 00:21:34.297
it actually begins to make sense.

450
00:21:34.297 --> 00:21:37.257
And effectively, all this talk about cows and sheep

451
00:21:37.257 --> 00:21:39.669
was all astrology.

452
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:41.870
<v Regina>Right, which the Egyptians were noted for.</v>

453
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.190
<v ->Of course.</v>

454
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.086
Now, a lot of people will say that the zodiac does not

455
00:21:46.086 --> 00:21:47.414
go back that far.

456
00:21:47.414 --> 00:21:48.404
You know, "It's Greek."

457
00:21:48.404 --> 00:21:49.453
"It doesn't go back."

458
00:21:49.453 --> 00:21:52.624
But it seems quite clear from the writings of Josephus

459
00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:56.184
that it did, because he plainly states that

460
00:21:56.184 --> 00:22:00.251
the loaves on the altar, the 12 loaves,

461
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:02.677
represented the 12 constellations,

462
00:22:02.677 --> 00:22:05.206
that the buttons on the priest's tunic

463
00:22:05.206 --> 00:22:07.398
represented the constellations, et cetera,

464
00:22:07.398 --> 00:22:09.378
and the seven planets.

465
00:22:09.378 --> 00:22:12.596
The menorah represented the seven planets, et cetera.

466
00:22:12.596 --> 00:22:15.715
And of course he's talking about the era of Moses again

467
00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:20.416
and Joseph, which in normal terms

468
00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:25.202
must be around 1600, 1500 B.C.

469
00:22:25.202 --> 00:22:29.669
So Josephus is saying quite clearly that the knowledge

470
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:31.789
of the zodiac goes back at least that far.

471
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:32.887
<v Regina>So I only bring that up</v>

472
00:22:32.887 --> 00:22:35.124
to say that this is just one example of

473
00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:38.703
how the Bible and how other texts, the Torah,

474
00:22:38.703 --> 00:22:40.570
the Old Testament--

475
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.997
Would you say the Quran, as well,

476
00:22:41.997 --> 00:22:44.607
can be read, again, on these dual levels?

477
00:22:44.607 --> 00:22:45.734
<v ->Very much so.</v>

478
00:22:45.734 --> 00:22:47.881
<v Regina>Embedded with the same characters.</v>

479
00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:49.537
<v ->A typical one is Jesus, of course.</v>

480
00:22:49.537 --> 00:22:52.976
Jesus was born as a lamb of God,

481
00:22:52.976 --> 00:22:55.047
but he became a fisher of men.

482
00:22:55.777 --> 00:22:56.637
Why?

483
00:22:56.637 --> 00:23:00.007
Well, because under precession the Earth rose--

484
00:23:00.007 --> 00:23:01.119
<v Regina>Precession on the equinox,</v>

485
00:23:01.119 --> 00:23:02.879
which we have covered also.

486
00:23:02.879 --> 00:23:04.185
<v ->Indeed yes.</v>

487
00:23:04.185 --> 00:23:07.605
It rotates around into the different houses

488
00:23:07.605 --> 00:23:10.145
of the different paths of the constellations

489
00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:12.144
and at the turn of the first century, of course,

490
00:23:12.144 --> 00:23:15.551
we changed from Aries into Pisces.

491
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:19.039
And so Jesus was born as a lamb, but became a fisherman.

492
00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:24.762
And so again, we see this covert

493
00:23:24.762 --> 00:23:26.961
reference to the zodiac all the time,

494
00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:30.323
but of course most of this was destroyed and that's another

495
00:23:30.323 --> 00:23:32.163
reason why it became covered up.

496
00:23:32.163 --> 00:23:36.371
It wasn't just simply that this was initiation into

497
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:38.879
the church, but we also ended up with two

498
00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:42.549
churches during the time of Jesus.

499
00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:45.940
We had the church of Jesus and James,

500
00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.242
but then there was a split, of course.

501
00:23:48.242 --> 00:23:52.442
And Saul, or Saint Paul, went off and did his own thing.

502
00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.948
Now, Saul had been the enemy of Jesus

503
00:23:55.948 --> 00:23:58.229
and so they were very cautious about this guy.

504
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:00.708
They didn't trust him, so Saul had never really

505
00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:04.224
been initiated into the full meaning

506
00:24:04.224 --> 00:24:06.364
of the church of Jesus and James.

507
00:24:06.364 --> 00:24:09.425
So when he went off and started his own church,

508
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:11.544
he didn't know all the secrets.

509
00:24:11.544 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Regina>And this is where a lot of the</v>

510
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.520
Christian doctrine came from, right?

511
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.337
<v ->Yeah, Christianity has nothing to do</v>

512
00:24:16.337 --> 00:24:18.156
with the church of Jesus and James.

513
00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:20.104
It is the church of Saul.

514
00:24:20.104 --> 00:24:22.005
It's the splinter group.

515
00:24:22.005 --> 00:24:24.045
So we have this big confrontation between

516
00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:27.115
the church of James and the church of Saul.

517
00:24:28.247 --> 00:24:30.922
Now, the church of Jesus and James of course was Jewish.

518
00:24:30.922 --> 00:24:32.436
It was a Jewish sect.

519
00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:34.155
You had to be circumcised.

520
00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:38.217
You had to follow the Mosaic law, et cetera,

521
00:24:38.217 --> 00:24:42.111
all of the normal things you would find within Judaism.

522
00:24:42.111 --> 00:24:44.893
It's more of a way of life, et cetera,

523
00:24:44.893 --> 00:24:47.311
than a straight religion.

524
00:24:47.311 --> 00:24:50.292
Saul on the other hand, went off and he

525
00:24:50.292 --> 00:24:54.931
wanted to found a popularist church.

526
00:24:54.931 --> 00:24:57.767
So he went off and said,

527
00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:00.239
"Okay, I'm not only gonna preach to the Jews,

528
00:25:00.239 --> 00:25:03.761
"but we'll preach to the Gentiles as well,

529
00:25:03.761 --> 00:25:05.520
"because there's more gentiles than Jews,

530
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.857
"and I want to be a successful church."

531
00:25:07.857 --> 00:25:11.737
So he went off and started preaching to gentiles.

532
00:25:11.737 --> 00:25:14.495
And he scrapped all of Mosaic law,

533
00:25:14.495 --> 00:25:17.175
and just had the Ten Commandments.

534
00:25:18.445 --> 00:25:22.206
And then we had this big discussion about circumcision

535
00:25:22.206 --> 00:25:25.013
of course, which you had to be circumcised,

536
00:25:25.013 --> 00:25:27.088
obviously, within the church of Jesus.

537
00:25:27.898 --> 00:25:32.758
And Saul went off and he started not only accepting people

538
00:25:32.758 --> 00:25:35.144
who weren't circumcised, he actually said,

539
00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:38.930
"Well, if circumcision means that much to the Jews,

540
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.271
"why don't they just cut their penis off

541
00:25:40.271 --> 00:25:42.421
"and have done with it?"

542
00:25:42.811 --> 00:25:45.324
And that's in Acts, oh no it's in...

543
00:25:45.324 --> 00:25:46.919
<v Regina>Rather denigrating statement.</v>

544
00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:48.659
<v ->Galatians, yes.</v>

545
00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:52.599
And so we can see this big separation

546
00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:55.019
between the original church of Jesus

547
00:25:55.019 --> 00:25:57.289
and the new church of Saul.

548
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:59.170
And it was the church of Saul of course

549
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.999
that became dominant.

550
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.059
It was much more commercial.

551
00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:06.499
It was more like,

552
00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:09.299
perhaps some of these televangelists that you see

553
00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:11.470
on American television.

554
00:26:11.619 --> 00:26:14.278
He was there for the money

555
00:26:14.278 --> 00:26:17.798
and he became the dominant church in that region.

556
00:26:17.798 --> 00:26:20.077
And the church of Jesus and James

557
00:26:20.077 --> 00:26:22.248
sunk into obscurity.

558
00:26:22.248 --> 00:26:24.457
<v Regina>So I know since then</v>

559
00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:27.078
the texts that happen in the New Testament

560
00:26:27.078 --> 00:26:31.787
base of work, essentially became

561
00:26:31.787 --> 00:26:34.635
also included in the King James version.

562
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:35.595
Is that fair to say?

563
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:37.854
Is this all rooted back to the church of Saul?

564
00:26:37.854 --> 00:26:39.174
<v ->Yes, all of it.</v>

565
00:26:39.174 --> 00:26:40.795
Now, he did pick out, obviously,

566
00:26:40.795 --> 00:26:45.756
some areas from the church of Jesus and James, of course.

567
00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:49.855
But most of what he picked out, of course,

568
00:26:49.855 --> 00:26:52.216
had nothing to do with the original church.

569
00:26:52.216 --> 00:26:54.336
This is why we see this big difference.

570
00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:56.135
And so, within the church of Saul,

571
00:26:56.135 --> 00:26:57.575
which became Christianity, of course,

572
00:26:57.575 --> 00:27:02.153
we don't see any reference to the zodiac.

573
00:27:02.153 --> 00:27:03.923
Astrology became banned.

574
00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:06.113
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

575
00:27:06.113 --> 00:27:09.552
<v ->We don't see the role of women</v>

576
00:27:09.552 --> 00:27:13.653
because Saul was the original misogynist.

577
00:27:13.653 --> 00:27:15.433
<v Regina>And that's reflected in the Bible.</v>

578
00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:16.371
<v ->Very much so.</v>

579
00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:17.971
<v Regina>Mothers are whores.</v>

580
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:21.301
<v ->Yeah, and you know, women must be seen and not heard</v>

581
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:23.358
and all that sort of business.

582
00:27:23.358 --> 00:27:27.038
Whereas we know from the few texts we do have

583
00:27:27.038 --> 00:27:28.918
about the church of Jesus and James,

584
00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:33.717
that Mary Magdalene of course was the senior disciple.

585
00:27:33.717 --> 00:27:37.178
And hence we have this

586
00:27:37.178 --> 00:27:41.358
slightly new discussion, but it is an old discussion,

587
00:27:41.358 --> 00:27:44.238
about whether Mary Magdalene was in the Last Supper scene.

588
00:27:44.238 --> 00:27:46.218
<v Regina>Right, and we're going to get into that,</v>

589
00:27:46.218 --> 00:27:47.778
the whole lineage of Jesus--

590
00:27:47.778 --> 00:27:49.337
Actually, we're going to separate that out

591
00:27:49.337 --> 00:27:50.518
into a separate interview,

592
00:27:50.518 --> 00:27:53.279
so we'll keep people on the line a bit here, won't we?

593
00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.337
But not intentionally.

594
00:27:54.337 --> 00:27:56.518
It's just that there's so much more to cover here,

595
00:27:56.518 --> 00:27:57.678
out of the Old Testament.

596
00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:00.298
So, if you can continue on what you were saying,

597
00:28:00.298 --> 00:28:05.219
and then also let's get into the Temple at Jerusalem.

598
00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:06.598
I don't know if that's a non sequitur

599
00:28:06.598 --> 00:28:08.768
and we should just jump there right now but--

600
00:28:08.768 --> 00:28:09.848
What would you prefer?

601
00:28:09.848 --> 00:28:10.990
<v ->Yes.</v>

602
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.570
Well, yes.

603
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.118
Let's go back to the building of the Temple of Jerusalem.

604
00:28:17.507 --> 00:28:21.156
So that's going back to the United Monarchy era

605
00:28:21.156 --> 00:28:24.027
of David and King Solomon.

606
00:28:24.197 --> 00:28:25.176
As we were saying before,

607
00:28:25.176 --> 00:28:27.256
they can't be found in the historical records.

608
00:28:27.256 --> 00:28:28.870
So where were they?

609
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.329
And having spoken so much about Egypt,

610
00:28:31.329 --> 00:28:33.649
let's look at them

611
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:35.469
from the Egyptian perspective.

612
00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:38.709
And obviously we're not gonna find those names

613
00:28:38.709 --> 00:28:39.950
within the historical record,

614
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.228
because otherwise they would have been found already.

615
00:28:42.228 --> 00:28:44.670
People would have known about them.

616
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.909
So what we're looking for

617
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:49.310
is a couple of attributes that are central

618
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.629
to the United Monarchy story.

619
00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:54.870
And that is King David, who was known as...

620
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.179
Well, he was primarily known for the city and the star,

621
00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:02.609
the City of David and the Star of David.

622
00:29:02.939 --> 00:29:07.199
And these are two very, very important shibboleths

623
00:29:07.199 --> 00:29:09.319
of his reign.

624
00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:11.179
And so what we're looking for

625
00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:14.620
is something similar within the Egyptian record.

626
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.617
Of course if we look in exactly the same era as King David,

627
00:29:19.617 --> 00:29:23.616
we find a pharaoh from Lower Egypt,

628
00:29:23.616 --> 00:29:26.057
again, the Hyksos,

629
00:29:26.057 --> 00:29:29.457
who was known for the city and the star.

630
00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:32.507
And his name was Pasebakhaennuit,

631
00:29:32.507 --> 00:29:36.468
or Psusennes in the Greek version.

632
00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:42.028
His name actually has the city glyph and the star glyph.

633
00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:44.709
That was my starting point.

634
00:29:44.709 --> 00:29:46.789
<v Regina>And that's interesting because</v>

635
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:48.810
when you look at the Star of David

636
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.694
and you look at the star tetrahedron

637
00:29:50.694 --> 00:29:53.055
embedded all throughout Egyptology,

638
00:29:53.055 --> 00:29:55.395
it's the same star.

639
00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:56.604
<v ->Yes.</v>

640
00:29:56.604 --> 00:29:58.175
Well, they had two stars in Egypt, of course.

641
00:29:58.175 --> 00:29:59.896
Most of them were the pentagon star.

642
00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:02.236
Most of them were five-sided stars.

643
00:30:02.236 --> 00:30:05.156
The Star of David, of course, is two pyramids.

644
00:30:05.156 --> 00:30:06.596
<v Regina>Right, the star tetrahedron,</v>

645
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:09.356
which is in a lot of the mysticism of Egypt.

646
00:30:09.356 --> 00:30:12.736
<v ->It's simply two pyramids superimposed on each other.</v>

647
00:30:12.736 --> 00:30:16.196
And that's important, because that's where

648
00:30:16.196 --> 00:30:17.396
the symbology came from.

649
00:30:17.396 --> 00:30:18.276
It came from Giza.

650
00:30:18.276 --> 00:30:20.866
It came from the Pyramids.

651
00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:23.097
But here we have a monarch

652
00:30:23.097 --> 00:30:27.186
who has the same attributes as King David.

653
00:30:27.435 --> 00:30:30.136
And so, I just started idly looking

654
00:30:30.136 --> 00:30:33.646
at this monarch and seeing if anything else compares,

655
00:30:33.646 --> 00:30:36.216
because obviously if...

656
00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:37.296
What I'm saying here,

657
00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:38.797
it's a big jump of course,

658
00:30:38.797 --> 00:30:43.496
is that King David was this pharaoh called Psusennes.

659
00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:46.086
But if he was, then everything else

660
00:30:46.086 --> 00:30:48.935
around him within the United Monarchy,

661
00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:52.396
his ancestors, his descendants, his courtiers,

662
00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:54.885
everything should be the same.

663
00:30:55.815 --> 00:30:58.935
Now, you might think that is impossible,

664
00:30:58.935 --> 00:31:02.595
that everything from the court of King David

665
00:31:02.595 --> 00:31:06.084
could be the same as the court of this particular pharaoh.

666
00:31:06.514 --> 00:31:08.354
But it's not.

667
00:31:08.354 --> 00:31:10.115
It's exactly the same.

668
00:31:10.115 --> 00:31:12.614
So he has the same ancestors.

669
00:31:12.614 --> 00:31:14.274
He has the same descendants.

670
00:31:14.274 --> 00:31:15.694
He has the same daughter.

671
00:31:15.694 --> 00:31:17.654
The same army commander.

672
00:31:17.654 --> 00:31:19.595
The same architect.

673
00:31:19.595 --> 00:31:23.704
So, let's have a look at a few of those.

674
00:31:24.795 --> 00:31:27.795
One of the ancestors of King David

675
00:31:27.795 --> 00:31:30.014
of course was Salmon

676
00:31:30.014 --> 00:31:34.114
and the direct ancestor of Psusennes was called Siamun.

677
00:31:34.114 --> 00:31:36.444
Siamun, Salmon.

678
00:31:36.444 --> 00:31:38.973
His daughter, the daughter of King David,

679
00:31:38.973 --> 00:31:41.723
was called Maakhah Tamar.

680
00:31:41.723 --> 00:31:44.572
And if we look into the historical record,

681
00:31:44.572 --> 00:31:46.892
the daughter of this particular pharaoh

682
00:31:46.892 --> 00:31:50.172
was called Maakhare Mu-Tamhat.

683
00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:53.402
Maakhah Tamar, Maakhare Mu-Tamhat.

684
00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.972
His army commander, for King David,

685
00:31:55.972 --> 00:31:58.162
was called Joab.

686
00:31:58.172 --> 00:32:01.777
And the army commander of this particular pharaoh

687
00:32:01.777 --> 00:32:06.127
was called Un-joab-endjed, Joab.

688
00:32:06.597 --> 00:32:09.317
And so we see all these links coming together,

689
00:32:09.317 --> 00:32:10.917
where everything fits together.

690
00:32:10.917 --> 00:32:13.296
So it's not just a shot in the dark,

691
00:32:13.296 --> 00:32:17.578
that, you know, this monarch is around at the same time

692
00:32:17.578 --> 00:32:21.056
as King David, and perhaps he could be associated

693
00:32:21.056 --> 00:32:22.858
with stars and cities.

694
00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:25.536
It's his entire court,

695
00:32:25.536 --> 00:32:30.536
seems to be identical to the court of King David.

696
00:32:31.576 --> 00:32:34.436
And so I made this radical proposal

697
00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:37.577
that he was King David.

698
00:32:37.577 --> 00:32:40.736
And so many things began to fit together.

699
00:32:40.736 --> 00:32:42.457
It was untrue.

700
00:32:42.457 --> 00:32:45.557
One of the central points was,

701
00:32:45.557 --> 00:32:47.817
where was his court located?

702
00:32:47.817 --> 00:32:50.276
So where was his capital city?

703
00:32:50.276 --> 00:32:51.177
Was it in Jerusalem?

704
00:32:51.177 --> 00:32:53.896
Because these pharaohs actually did start,

705
00:32:53.896 --> 00:32:55.936
later on in the next reign,

706
00:32:55.936 --> 00:32:58.536
to control all of Judea as well.

707
00:32:58.536 --> 00:33:00.836
So, they were influential in Judea

708
00:33:00.836 --> 00:33:03.947
as well as Lower Egypt.

709
00:33:06.837 --> 00:33:08.817
So, where was the capital city?

710
00:33:08.817 --> 00:33:11.626
Well it just so happens that the original names

711
00:33:11.626 --> 00:33:16.466
for Jerusalem were Zion

712
00:33:16.466 --> 00:33:19.158
and Jebus.

713
00:33:19.487 --> 00:33:22.567
Those were the original names of Jerusalem

714
00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:23.907
and it's from there, of course,

715
00:33:23.907 --> 00:33:27.778
that we get the Zionists of course, from Zion.

716
00:33:28.128 --> 00:33:33.128
As it happens, the city of Tanis in Egypt was called Zoan.

717
00:33:34.427 --> 00:33:35.758
Zoan, Zion.

718
00:33:35.758 --> 00:33:38.058
<v Regina>And that's near Port Said.</v>

719
00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:40.477
<v ->Yes, it's up in the northeast delta.</v>

720
00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:43.268
And it was also called Jebet.

721
00:33:43.507 --> 00:33:45.600
Jebet, Jebus.

722
00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.666
So, even the city has the same names

723
00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:50.686
as are used for Jerusalem.

724
00:33:50.686 --> 00:33:53.706
And so this proposal becomes even more radical,

725
00:33:53.706 --> 00:33:55.006
because what I'm saying here

726
00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:58.186
is that not only was this monarch

727
00:33:58.186 --> 00:34:01.385
actually a Lower Egyptian Monarch,

728
00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:05.975
but the capital city was located

729
00:34:05.975 --> 00:34:09.224
in the Nile Delta at Tanis.

730
00:34:11.054 --> 00:34:16.054
And so it's a big radical change

731
00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:20.504
to the story,

732
00:34:20.504 --> 00:34:22.944
but actually, in some senses it's not.

733
00:34:22.944 --> 00:34:25.263
All I'm saying is, it wasn't there.

734
00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:27.513
It was here.

735
00:34:27.513 --> 00:34:29.863
All we're doing is changing the location

736
00:34:29.863 --> 00:34:33.142
and suddenly, everything within the Bible

737
00:34:33.142 --> 00:34:35.162
at that point in time, the United Monarchy,

738
00:34:35.162 --> 00:34:36.123
starts to make sense.

739
00:34:36.123 --> 00:34:37.372
<v Regina>Right, because you also talk</v>

740
00:34:37.372 --> 00:34:40.241
about references where in the Bible,

741
00:34:40.241 --> 00:34:43.511
in the Torah also, where it specifically refers

742
00:34:43.511 --> 00:34:47.295
to going in a particular direction

743
00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:50.055
to get supplies for example.

744
00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:51.814
And those directions would line up

745
00:34:51.814 --> 00:34:54.876
with coming from Zoan, as you say,

746
00:34:54.876 --> 00:34:57.774
Tanis as you say, rather than Jerusalem

747
00:34:57.774 --> 00:34:59.075
in some cases.

748
00:34:59.075 --> 00:35:00.514
<v ->Yes, they had lots of mentions</v>

749
00:35:00.514 --> 00:35:03.075
of going down into Egypt, which would seem

750
00:35:03.075 --> 00:35:07.074
to separate the biblical story from Egypt.

751
00:35:07.074 --> 00:35:09.055
<v Regina>Right, or going south.</v>

752
00:35:09.055 --> 00:35:12.705
<v ->But within the ancient texts, the Egyptian texts,</v>

753
00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:15.024
they had the same terminology,

754
00:35:15.024 --> 00:35:18.603
and even within Josephus they have the same terminology.

755
00:35:18.603 --> 00:35:21.005
And they go from the Nile Delta

756
00:35:21.005 --> 00:35:23.324
down into Egypt.

757
00:35:23.324 --> 00:35:25.643
So Egypt obviously in that era

758
00:35:25.643 --> 00:35:29.844
was really a reference to Upper Egypt, to Thebes.

759
00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:34.043
It didn't really refer to the entire area

760
00:35:34.043 --> 00:35:36.143
that we would know as Egypt today.

761
00:35:36.143 --> 00:35:38.243
And so, yes, these stories about

762
00:35:38.243 --> 00:35:41.283
people going down into Egypt still make sense,

763
00:35:41.283 --> 00:35:44.027
even if you locate Jerusalem in Tanis.

764
00:35:44.027 --> 00:35:45.526
<v Regina>In Tanis.</v>

765
00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:48.956
So, if we can get to this for a second,

766
00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:51.917
what is in Jerusalem, supposedly,

767
00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:54.426
under the Temple Mount, then?

768
00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:55.577
<v ->Well, there's nothing.</v>

769
00:35:55.577 --> 00:35:57.336
This is the problem.

770
00:35:57.336 --> 00:36:01.297
They can't find anything that can show

771
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:04.448
that the Temple of Solomon was actually there.

772
00:36:06.218 --> 00:36:09.017
And so we have a big gap in the archaeology.

773
00:36:09.017 --> 00:36:11.938
They can't find David and Solomon's palace.

774
00:36:11.938 --> 00:36:13.037
They can't find his temple.

775
00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:17.197
They can't find any major city within Jerusalem

776
00:36:17.197 --> 00:36:18.997
at that time.

777
00:36:18.997 --> 00:36:21.007
This is the Jerusalem, obviously, in Israel.

778
00:36:21.007 --> 00:36:23.156
<v Regina>Because this was, as you say, a village.</v>

779
00:36:23.156 --> 00:36:24.535
It wasn't a thriving metropolis.

780
00:36:24.535 --> 00:36:27.135
<v ->It was only a village in that era.</v>

781
00:36:27.906 --> 00:36:31.547
But of course, if you come back into Tanis,

782
00:36:31.547 --> 00:36:33.785
of course, this was a major metropolis.

783
00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:37.365
And it had, not just one temple, it had several temples

784
00:36:37.365 --> 00:36:40.385
and the most marvelous architecture,

785
00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:43.366
huge great pillars,

786
00:36:43.366 --> 00:36:46.526
granite pillars made in the shape of

787
00:36:46.526 --> 00:36:48.285
palm trees.

788
00:36:48.285 --> 00:36:51.674
Beautifully carved, fantastic pieces of workmanship.

789
00:36:51.674 --> 00:36:55.234
And of course, the temple there has the same name

790
00:36:55.234 --> 00:36:57.623
as the temple in Jerusalem.

791
00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.673
Again, you know, everything just starts--

792
00:36:59.673 --> 00:37:00.553
You just have to read the book

793
00:37:00.553 --> 00:37:01.553
and everything fits together.

794
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:03.073
It's amazing.

795
00:37:03.073 --> 00:37:04.773
The Temple of Jerusalem was known

796
00:37:04.773 --> 00:37:08.433
as the Hikal Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh.

797
00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:10.533
And the temple in Tanis was known

798
00:37:10.533 --> 00:37:14.782
as the Hetka Ptah, the temple of Ptar.

799
00:37:14.782 --> 00:37:16.962
Hikal, Hetka.

800
00:37:16.962 --> 00:37:19.672
It has the same prefix.

801
00:37:20.342 --> 00:37:23.802
And so, yes, I think

802
00:37:23.802 --> 00:37:26.242
we will find eventually that the Temple of Jerusalem

803
00:37:26.242 --> 00:37:27.702
was actually in Tanis.

804
00:37:27.702 --> 00:37:30.042
It was one of the Tanis temples,

805
00:37:30.042 --> 00:37:31.862
either the main temple, or perhaps

806
00:37:31.862 --> 00:37:35.662
the new, smaller temple which was built on the back.

807
00:37:35.662 --> 00:37:36.702
<v Regina>So, needless to say,</v>

808
00:37:36.702 --> 00:37:39.042
this has very large implications

809
00:37:39.042 --> 00:37:41.122
as to what's going on in modern times

810
00:37:41.122 --> 00:37:43.002
in the city of Jerusalem.
<v ->It does.</v>

811
00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:44.738
It means the Zionists are looking in the wrong place

812
00:37:44.738 --> 00:37:45.922
for the homeland, you know.

813
00:37:45.922 --> 00:37:50.222
The original homeland was Zoan, not Zion.

814
00:37:50.222 --> 00:37:53.482
It was Tanis, the Nile Delta,

815
00:37:53.482 --> 00:37:57.862
because the Israelites were the Lower Egyptians,

816
00:37:57.862 --> 00:38:02.702
the Hyksos Egyptians from Lower Egypt.

817
00:38:02.702 --> 00:38:04.162
And that was their original homeland.

818
00:38:04.162 --> 00:38:07.922
So yes, it's very contentious, but it makes sense

819
00:38:07.922 --> 00:38:11.342
and it makes much more sense than throwing out the Bible

820
00:38:11.342 --> 00:38:14.462
and saying it's just mythology.

821
00:38:14.462 --> 00:38:15.882
If you think about it, here we've got

822
00:38:15.882 --> 00:38:18.502
the entire history of this region,

823
00:38:18.502 --> 00:38:21.662
whether it be Egypt or Israel,

824
00:38:21.662 --> 00:38:26.162
that goes back at least sort of 2,000 B.C.

825
00:38:26.162 --> 00:38:30.222
Now, if someone today was rummaging around

826
00:38:30.222 --> 00:38:33.262
near the Dead Sea and they entered a cave

827
00:38:33.262 --> 00:38:36.998
and found this pot with this book in it,

828
00:38:36.998 --> 00:38:39.018
which was called the Bible,

829
00:38:39.018 --> 00:38:41.798
they would be going through every single last letter

830
00:38:41.798 --> 00:38:45.988
and sentence in this book trying to find real history.

831
00:38:47.038 --> 00:38:49.938
But because the Bible has religious baggage

832
00:38:49.938 --> 00:38:53.567
attached to it, the Egyptologists,

833
00:38:53.567 --> 00:38:55.887
and even the archaeologists from Israel,

834
00:38:55.887 --> 00:38:57.997
won't really touch it.

835
00:38:58.487 --> 00:39:02.067
It's almost taboo for them because it's religious.

836
00:39:02.067 --> 00:39:02.767
But it's not.

837
00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:04.587
It's a historical text

838
00:39:04.587 --> 00:39:06.207
and it's a historical text that has come

839
00:39:06.207 --> 00:39:09.067
straight out of ancient history.

840
00:39:09.067 --> 00:39:11.107
Now, they try to deflect this by saying,

841
00:39:11.107 --> 00:39:12.808
"Oh, you know, these were just poor shepherds

842
00:39:12.808 --> 00:39:15.687
"and therefore it's a big oral tradition

843
00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:18.247
"and therefore a lot of the history will be garbled

844
00:39:18.247 --> 00:39:19.928
"with Chinese whisper syndromes

845
00:39:19.928 --> 00:39:22.317
"and all the rest of this business."

846
00:39:22.387 --> 00:39:24.267
But no, it wasn't.

847
00:39:24.267 --> 00:39:25.647
These were pharaohs.

848
00:39:25.647 --> 00:39:27.087
They would have had scribes.

849
00:39:27.087 --> 00:39:28.988
It would not have been an oral history.

850
00:39:28.988 --> 00:39:33.587
This was a written history that came from Abraham,

851
00:39:33.587 --> 00:39:37.547
who I say was Pharaoh Mamayebra.

852
00:39:37.547 --> 00:39:41.887
And from Jacob, who I say was Pharaoh Jacob.

853
00:39:41.887 --> 00:39:43.327
And that's something they don't tell you about,

854
00:39:43.327 --> 00:39:45.927
that there was a pharaoh from northern Egypt

855
00:39:45.927 --> 00:39:49.057
who was called Jacob, Jacoba.

856
00:39:49.127 --> 00:39:50.518
Jacoba.

857
00:39:51.528 --> 00:39:54.107
So, in this new guise,

858
00:39:54.107 --> 00:39:56.107
it's no longer an oral history

859
00:39:56.107 --> 00:39:58.127
of a few Bedouin floating around

860
00:39:58.127 --> 00:40:00.667
with half a dozen starving sheep.

861
00:40:00.667 --> 00:40:04.047
We now have the Bible as being the daybook,

862
00:40:04.047 --> 00:40:05.947
within Egypt, within the royal court--

863
00:40:05.947 --> 00:40:08.347
And they probably still do the same now, I don't know.

864
00:40:08.347 --> 00:40:12.087
But the royal court in Egypt used to keep a daybook,

865
00:40:12.087 --> 00:40:16.238
a diary, and this was a diary of the royal court.

866
00:40:16.687 --> 00:40:19.627
The trivia, the main events,

867
00:40:19.627 --> 00:40:22.647
everything that was going on within the royal court,

868
00:40:22.647 --> 00:40:24.887
was recorded in the daybook.

869
00:40:24.887 --> 00:40:27.187
So essentially, what I'm saying is the Bible

870
00:40:27.187 --> 00:40:31.127
is the daybook of the Hyksos pharaohs

871
00:40:31.127 --> 00:40:32.387
of Lower Egypt.

872
00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:34.748
<v Regina>Which gives it a whole other level</v>

873
00:40:34.748 --> 00:40:35.667
of importance.

874
00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:36.307
<v ->Absolutely,</v>

875
00:40:36.307 --> 00:40:38.886
and it also means that it is not an oral history.

876
00:40:38.886 --> 00:40:39.927
It was a written history.

877
00:40:39.927 --> 00:40:41.867
They would have had the scribes.

878
00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:45.927
And so it could well be an exact history

879
00:40:45.927 --> 00:40:48.066
of what happened in that era.

880
00:40:48.066 --> 00:40:50.126
So instead of being mythology, now we're saying

881
00:40:50.126 --> 00:40:53.747
it is 100% historical fact

882
00:40:53.747 --> 00:40:56.768
if you can understand what it was saying.

883
00:40:56.768 --> 00:40:59.467
So, these things we've been talking about before,

884
00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:02.845
when we're talking about sheep and bulls,

885
00:41:02.845 --> 00:41:06.346
we're actually talking about Apis bull worship

886
00:41:06.346 --> 00:41:10.127
and sheep, Aries worship.

887
00:41:10.536 --> 00:41:12.436
The cult, hence the shepherd kings of course,

888
00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.095
this is why they were called the shepherd kings,

889
00:41:14.095 --> 00:41:17.735
because Aries was the dominant constellation at that time.

890
00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:19.723
That's why they were called the shepherd kings.

891
00:41:19.723 --> 00:41:21.152
<v Regina>Well, even the word Hyksos itself</v>

892
00:41:21.152 --> 00:41:22.212
has two meanings.

893
00:41:22.212 --> 00:41:24.184
<v ->It does, yes.</v>

894
00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:27.933
A lot of people will say, "It doesn't mean shepherd king."

895
00:41:27.933 --> 00:41:31.653
But clearly, Josephus and Manetho said,

896
00:41:31.653 --> 00:41:34.113
"It does mean shepherd king."

897
00:41:34.113 --> 00:41:36.273
And the giveaway there is that it's spelt

898
00:41:36.273 --> 00:41:38.772
with the shepherd's crook,

899
00:41:38.772 --> 00:41:42.163
and so we can see it has a connection with shepherds.

900
00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:48.026
In actual fact, the word is Hykau-Khasut

901
00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:49.467
which tends to mean--

902
00:41:49.467 --> 00:41:51.287
Well, Egyptologists will say

903
00:41:51.287 --> 00:41:55.766
that it means the kings of the foreign lands,

904
00:41:55.766 --> 00:41:57.406
but it doesn't.

905
00:41:57.406 --> 00:42:00.027
The literal translation is Hykau-Khasut,

906
00:42:00.027 --> 00:42:03.256
the kings of the mountains.

907
00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:05.547
But I've retranslated that,

908
00:42:05.547 --> 00:42:09.247
because that really doesn't make much sense.

909
00:42:09.247 --> 00:42:10.716
That's why they say it's foreign,

910
00:42:10.716 --> 00:42:12.237
because there's no mountains in Egypts,

911
00:42:12.237 --> 00:42:13.646
and therefore anything to do with mountains

912
00:42:13.646 --> 00:42:15.286
has to be foreign.

913
00:42:15.286 --> 00:42:17.846
No, because this particular glyph is used

914
00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:20.727
in many things that are purely Egyptian,

915
00:42:20.727 --> 00:42:22.426
so it doesn't mean foreign.

916
00:42:22.426 --> 00:42:23.726
So, what does khasut mean?

917
00:42:23.726 --> 00:42:26.066
What's this mountains?

918
00:42:26.066 --> 00:42:29.526
And of course, the big sacred mountains of Egypt

919
00:42:29.526 --> 00:42:33.126
are going about, back again, to King Solomon

920
00:42:33.126 --> 00:42:35.176
and the Star of David.

921
00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:39.012
The sacred mountains of Egypt were the pyramids.

922
00:42:39.402 --> 00:42:40.982
And so they were the Hykau-Khasut.

923
00:42:40.982 --> 00:42:44.542
They were the kings of the pyramids, the kings of Giza,

924
00:42:44.542 --> 00:42:49.332
the people who ruled over the most sacred monument

925
00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:51.392
within Egypt.

926
00:42:51.392 --> 00:42:53.262
The Giza pyramids of course were not tombs.

927
00:42:53.262 --> 00:42:55.142
We're not talking about tombs here.

928
00:42:55.142 --> 00:42:56.662
The pyramids, the ancient pyramids,

929
00:42:56.662 --> 00:43:01.042
the megalithic pyramids have nothing to do with being tombs.

930
00:43:01.042 --> 00:43:05.022
They were cathedrals, perhaps.

931
00:43:05.022 --> 00:43:06.832
<v Regina>Some say observatories.</v>

932
00:43:06.832 --> 00:43:09.109
<v ->They had a huge great observatory</v>

933
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:12.280
on top of the Great Pyramid, so yes.

934
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.830
Egyptian religion had a great deal--

935
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:20.200
In fact, its fundamental element was astronomy.

936
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:24.149
And so, you would need an observatory.

937
00:43:24.149 --> 00:43:26.310
<v Regina>Very sophisticated mathematical formulas,</v>

938
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.310
very exact alignments.

939
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.210
<v ->As we know, the Pyramids are all based</v>

940
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.530
on mathematical formulae.

941
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.910
They are representations of the Belt of Orion

942
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:37.610
and things of that nature.

943
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.229
So, yes, they were observatories.

944
00:43:39.229 --> 00:43:40.670
They were the sacred mountains.

945
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.170
And so the kings of the mountains,

946
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.730
the Hykau-Khasut, the Hyksos,

947
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.770
were the kings of the pyramids.

948
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.250
These were the people who looked after

949
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:53.250
the sacred mountains of Egypt.

950
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.107
And while we're talking about this subject,

951
00:43:55.107 --> 00:43:56.867
we might as well come straight on

952
00:43:56.867 --> 00:44:01.248
to the sacred mountain of the Israelites, of course,

953
00:44:01.248 --> 00:44:03.588
because there we have another conundrum.

954
00:44:03.588 --> 00:44:06.987
We have these Israelites wandering around

955
00:44:06.987 --> 00:44:09.667
the Sinai Peninsula

956
00:44:09.667 --> 00:44:13.588
and having a sacred mountain, which was some craggy rock,

957
00:44:13.588 --> 00:44:16.467
in the middle of the Sinai Peninsula.

958
00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:19.767
Boulderdash, rubbish, nonsense.

959
00:44:19.767 --> 00:44:22.258
It doesn't make any sense.

960
00:44:22.327 --> 00:44:25.617
The Israelites were the Hyksos Egyptians

961
00:44:25.617 --> 00:44:27.707
of Lower Egypt,

962
00:44:27.707 --> 00:44:30.385
and so their sacred mountain

963
00:44:30.385 --> 00:44:32.816
was the Great Pyramid of Giza.

964
00:44:32.816 --> 00:44:37.105
And so Mount Sinai is the Great Pyramid.

965
00:44:37.105 --> 00:44:42.105
And okay, again, it's a huge jump...

966
00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:43.846
<v Regina>I don't know why, but I'm getting chills</v>

967
00:44:43.846 --> 00:44:45.745
as you're saying this.

968
00:44:45.745 --> 00:44:47.396
<v ->But suddenly it starts to make sense.</v>

969
00:44:47.396 --> 00:44:50.345
Here were the Israelites, sitting in Egypt,

970
00:44:50.345 --> 00:44:52.405
'cause we know the Israelites went to Egypt,

971
00:44:52.405 --> 00:44:55.925
even as the Bible says,

972
00:44:55.925 --> 00:44:57.925
with Joseph going down into Egypt

973
00:44:57.925 --> 00:44:59.564
and Moses being in Egypt.

974
00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:01.906
So, they were in Egypt for anything between

975
00:45:01.906 --> 00:45:04.945
200 and 400 years,

976
00:45:04.945 --> 00:45:07.465
and yet nowhere in the Bible

977
00:45:07.465 --> 00:45:10.635
does it mention the Pyramids of Giza.

978
00:45:11.365 --> 00:45:13.905
These were the most magnificent monuments

979
00:45:13.905 --> 00:45:16.805
in ancient times.

980
00:45:16.805 --> 00:45:20.234
In an era when most people lived in mud huts,

981
00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:24.055
you've got this monument that's 150 meters high.

982
00:45:24.404 --> 00:45:27.324
And these people live in Egypt

983
00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:29.545
for at least 200 or 400 years

984
00:45:29.545 --> 00:45:32.184
and never mention the Pyramids?

985
00:45:32.184 --> 00:45:34.373
It's just not possible, is it?

986
00:45:35.185 --> 00:45:36.704
They did mention the Pyramids,

987
00:45:36.704 --> 00:45:40.714
but they called them Mount Sinai and Mount Horeb.

988
00:45:40.714 --> 00:45:43.723
And if you look at the descriptions of Mount Sinai,

989
00:45:43.723 --> 00:45:48.443
especially if you include the descriptions from Josephus,

990
00:45:48.443 --> 00:45:52.083
all of those descriptions match

991
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.883
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

992
00:45:53.883 --> 00:45:56.523
They say it was the highest mountain.

993
00:45:56.523 --> 00:45:57.682
Yes, it was.

994
00:45:57.682 --> 00:45:59.302
The Great Pyramid is the highest.

995
00:45:59.302 --> 00:46:03.302
It was sharp, difficult to climb.

996
00:46:03.302 --> 00:46:05.222
Yes, it was.

997
00:46:05.222 --> 00:46:08.243
It was the biggest mountain, as we've said,

998
00:46:08.243 --> 00:46:11.043
but it was also small enough that you could cordon it off,

999
00:46:11.043 --> 00:46:13.663
because you weren't allowed to touch the mountain.

1000
00:46:13.663 --> 00:46:15.703
So, you could actually put a cordon around the bottom

1001
00:46:15.703 --> 00:46:17.083
and stop people touching it.

1002
00:46:17.083 --> 00:46:19.594
So, it had to be actually quite small.

1003
00:46:21.124 --> 00:46:23.653
It had a cave inside it.

1004
00:46:23.653 --> 00:46:25.022
Now, a lot of people will say that Moses

1005
00:46:25.022 --> 00:46:26.592
went to the top of Mount Sinai.

1006
00:46:26.592 --> 00:46:27.423
He didn't.

1007
00:46:27.423 --> 00:46:30.105
He went inside Mount Sinai,

1008
00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:33.644
and the Quran is quite emphatic about this.

1009
00:46:33.644 --> 00:46:37.355
The initiates went down inside of the mountain,

1010
00:46:37.355 --> 00:46:40.996
holding on a rope, so there was a cave inside it,

1011
00:46:40.996 --> 00:46:43.665
just like there is in the Great Pyramid.

1012
00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:46.724
And, perhaps most convincingly of all,

1013
00:46:46.724 --> 00:46:49.143
at the base of the pyramid...

1014
00:46:49.143 --> 00:46:52.005
Correction, at the base of Mount Sinai,

1015
00:46:52.005 --> 00:46:55.584
was a pavement,

1016
00:46:55.584 --> 00:46:57.764
a basalt pavement

1017
00:46:57.764 --> 00:47:01.286
that looked like the night sky, polished, gleaming,

1018
00:47:01.286 --> 00:47:03.195
like the night sky.

1019
00:47:03.727 --> 00:47:05.506
So, where would you find that

1020
00:47:05.506 --> 00:47:07.366
in the Sinai Peninsula?

1021
00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:08.406
Well, you can't.

1022
00:47:08.406 --> 00:47:09.826
But of course, on the eastern face

1023
00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:13.408
of the Great Pyramid, we have the great basalt pavement.

1024
00:47:13.408 --> 00:47:15.227
And originally, that would have been a huge

1025
00:47:15.227 --> 00:47:18.047
black basalt pavement

1026
00:47:18.047 --> 00:47:20.367
which would have been polished

1027
00:47:20.367 --> 00:47:23.006
and shone like the night sky.

1028
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:27.060
And so, yeah, Mount Sinai

1029
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.998
is the Great Pyramid of Giza.

1030
00:47:29.998 --> 00:47:32.437
<v Regina>You know...</v>

1031
00:47:32.437 --> 00:47:34.968
Are you going to continue on that statement?

1032
00:47:34.968 --> 00:47:36.058
<v ->No, that's fine.</v>

1033
00:47:36.058 --> 00:47:36.979
<v Regina>I was going to say,</v>

1034
00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:39.318
I think we're running up on our time limit,

1035
00:47:39.318 --> 00:47:41.659
but that is so intriguing,

1036
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:43.658
that I would like to say at this point,

1037
00:47:43.658 --> 00:47:47.558
to have any of us that are intrigued with this,

1038
00:47:47.558 --> 00:47:48.738
to take a look at your books.

1039
00:47:48.738 --> 00:47:51.358
They're really pretty incredible works

1040
00:47:51.358 --> 00:47:53.338
and I would love to be able to

1041
00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:55.518
just secret away for about two weeks with them

1042
00:47:55.518 --> 00:47:57.908
and read every one of them and I'll do the best I can.

1043
00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:00.398
<v ->If I can say so myself, whether you agree</v>

1044
00:48:00.398 --> 00:48:04.138
with what I've written or whether you don't,

1045
00:48:04.138 --> 00:48:06.577
the books are 100% original.

1046
00:48:06.577 --> 00:48:09.277
So you won't find reprocessed information

1047
00:48:09.277 --> 00:48:10.778
from other people's books.

1048
00:48:10.778 --> 00:48:12.938
These are new thoughts, new ways of looking

1049
00:48:12.938 --> 00:48:14.737
at these problems.

1050
00:48:14.737 --> 00:48:17.638
And there's an awful lot of information in those books.

1051
00:48:17.638 --> 00:48:20.738
They are worth reading and then reading again,

1052
00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:22.998
because every page has new facts.

1053
00:48:22.998 --> 00:48:24.238
There's no padding.

1054
00:48:24.238 --> 00:48:25.299
There's no extras.

1055
00:48:25.299 --> 00:48:27.659
It's all new information.
<v Regina>I see this.</v>

1056
00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:29.777
Well, to say they're thought-provoking

1057
00:48:29.777 --> 00:48:33.257
is an understatement. (laughs)

1058
00:48:33.257 --> 00:48:37.557
So, I think I can only recommend that--

1059
00:48:37.557 --> 00:48:39.828
I've barely gotten into them, myself.

1060
00:48:39.828 --> 00:48:41.647
I'm very intrigued with what you're saying.

1061
00:48:41.647 --> 00:48:44.797
And again, in the pursuit of knowledge,

1062
00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:46.617
thank you for your offerings,

1063
00:48:46.617 --> 00:48:49.097
and we're going to continue this conversation

1064
00:48:49.097 --> 00:48:53.057
for part two, on the life of Jesus.

1065
00:48:54.178 --> 00:48:55.957
Thank you.

1066
00:48:55.957 --> 00:48:58.058
(soft, fast music)

1067
00:48:58.058 --> 00:48:59.617
Coming up soon, we'll be talking with Ralph

1068
00:48:59.617 --> 00:49:01.417
about the life of Jesus.

1069
00:49:01.417 --> 00:49:04.518
To say it's thought-provoking would be an understatement.

1070
00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:06.456
If you're interested in alternative views

1071
00:49:06.456 --> 00:49:08.619
of biblical history, you will also enjoy

1072
00:49:08.619 --> 00:49:10.577
our interview with Victoria S.

1073
00:49:10.577 --> 00:49:13.306
Until next time, thanks for watching.
