00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:03.245
<v ->Dr. Steven Hairfield is a mystic, monk,</v>

2
00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:04.928
psychic and scholar.

3
00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:07.865
His life's journey is the stuff of which movies are made.

4
00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.129
After a difficult home life as a youth

5
00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.498
Steven sought relief by volunteering

6
00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:15.273
for military duty in Vietnam during the war.

7
00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:18.378
Far beyond the reaches of his expectations in life,

8
00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:20.712
a monk appeared in a small village

9
00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:23.371
where he was stationed as an explosives expert.

10
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.867
This is where his spiritual awakening began,

11
00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:28.514
taking him ultimately to his beloved teacher

12
00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:30.151
master Lobsang.

13
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.432
<v ->My journey actual began as a,</v>

14
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.956
oddly enough, as a child.

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.374
I have no issue with sharing with people

16
00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:52.658
that I had probably the meanest dad on planet Earth.

17
00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:57.215
And when I had gotten my draft notice

18
00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.914
to go into the military I was actually excited.

19
00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.482
Little did I know I was jumping

20
00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.548
out of the frying pan into the fire.

21
00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:06.021
But because I don't believe there's any accident,

22
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:09.051
I now, in retrospect, look back and realize

23
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:12.198
that what I was doing was looking to find

24
00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:13.730
my relationship with with life

25
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.559
and what we term is the creator,

26
00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:18.473
whom I humorously refer to as mom.

27
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.037
Anyway, after all the training I went through

28
00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:24.510
I did end up in southeast Asia, Vietnam.

29
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.498
And ended up in a small community called Quang Ngai.

30
00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:31.613
And working with the second

31
00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.679
ARVN Vietnamese armored division.

32
00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.557
And it was, needless to say, hectic.

33
00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:41.187
<v Voiceover>(laughs) What a lovely word for Vietnam.</v>

34
00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:42.557
It was hectic.

35
00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:47.128
<v ->One day I had an urge and went into</v>

36
00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:48.666
the little village of Quang Ngai

37
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.462
which was actually a very beautiful old city,

38
00:01:52.352 --> 00:01:54.208
and I was walking down the street

39
00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:55.972
and I looked across the street

40
00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:57.906
and there was this Zen monk

41
00:01:57.906 --> 00:02:00.576
which I didn't know at the time.

42
00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.020
But he had the robes on, crimson red and yellow,

43
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.645
and he scurried across the street

44
00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:08.154
and walked right up to me.

45
00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.548
A little man, and put his finger in my face and said,

46
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:14.028
young man, if you do not learn to use what you have

47
00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:15.659
it will destroy you.

48
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.424
He had my attention.

49
00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:20.326
And we began to speak and he asked me to follow him.

50
00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:23.589
And we went maybe a mile and a half

51
00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.768
outside the city of Quang Ngai

52
00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:28.206
and there was this monastery.

53
00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:31.237
And he invited me to spend time with him,

54
00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:32.557
and I did.

55
00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:33.786
<v Voiceover>How was this possible?</v>

56
00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.798
What were some of the responsibilities you had

57
00:02:37.798 --> 00:02:40.248
while you were in this small town?

58
00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:44.418
<v ->Let us just say I was known as a weapons expert.</v>

59
00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:49.242
I blew things up.

60
00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:55.593
And I was wrestling with myself over that.

61
00:02:57.263 --> 00:02:58.936
And I realize now in retrospect

62
00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:01.406
that being in a war, that we have to understand

63
00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:03.739
just how low human can stoop

64
00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.537
so we can realize how high it can fly.

65
00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:10.645
And my teachers in the Zen monasteries

66
00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:12.508
began to open my mind to that.

67
00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:14.116
<v Voiceover>How were you able, I mean just,</v>

68
00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:15.987
I'm just looking at this from a practical level,

69
00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.820
were you able to just take a leave

70
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.759
of a few days at a time and go there?

71
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.857
How did this work? Did you sneak off at night

72
00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:25.490
and stay up 24/7? How did you do this?

73
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.796
<v ->On occasion all of the above,</v>

74
00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:29.194
but I had actually a wonderful CO

75
00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:33.940
who used to engage me in conversation about the Buddhists.

76
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.172
I found out he was actually a Buddhist.

77
00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:37.282
<v Voiceover>Oh how fortunate.</v>

78
00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:40.773
<v ->Yeah, it's one of those seeming streaks of luck</v>

79
00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:43.246
or strokes of luck, whatever you wish to call them.

80
00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.707
But I'm a person that doesn't believe in coincidence,

81
00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:47.922
and there again I had a CO

82
00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:49.826
that just said, yeah okay.

83
00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:51.184
When you're not in the field

84
00:03:51.184 --> 00:03:53.715
then go ahead, I know where to find you.

85
00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:55.221
<v Voiceover>Wonderful, so now I have that</v>

86
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:56.724
out of my logical portion of the brain.

87
00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:58.358
So once you were there in the monastery,

88
00:03:58.358 --> 00:03:59.496
with the monk...

89
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:03.494
<v ->What I found out is is Zen actually</v>

90
00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:06.303
was founded by an individual

91
00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:08.672
known as Bodhidharma, which is embodied path,

92
00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:10.437
is actually what that stands for.

93
00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:15.350
He was an offshoot of the Buddha and Buddhists.

94
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.077
He found out through the proper use of intuition

95
00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:20.583
that you could achieve enlightenment

96
00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.017
at a much faster rate.

97
00:04:22.017 --> 00:04:25.753
What the monk on the street that day realized within me

98
00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:27.886
is he could see from across the street

99
00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:30.891
an extremely high level of the intuitive sense.

100
00:04:30.891 --> 00:04:34.661
And Zen stands for fast path, or proper use

101
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.424
of intuition and or intertuition.

102
00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:41.333
And for about 14 months I was able to interact

103
00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.872
with the Zen traditions in southeast Asia.

104
00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:45.776
And then it was time for me to head back

105
00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:47.015
to the United States.

106
00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:49.717
And one of the main things that they taught me,

107
00:04:49.717 --> 00:04:52.712
and had me realize, which I rely on to this day,

108
00:04:52.712 --> 00:04:56.253
is always follow what my urges guide me to.

109
00:04:57.393 --> 00:04:59.056
And it paid off handsomely when I was

110
00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:01.921
in my senior year in college getting a degree in psychology

111
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.429
because I wanted to understand my own mind,

112
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.530
which is really why I was doing it.

113
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.960
I had started having an urge to go to India,

114
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.129
a place I'd never been.

115
00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.231
And as the days and weeks and months progressed

116
00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:19.493
it became, Regina, absolutely totally overpowering.

117
00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:23.069
And I knew that I just had to go to India.

118
00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.874
I knew I was going to graduate,

119
00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:27.379
I didn't even hang around for my graduation ceremony.

120
00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.114
I sold everything I had, bought a pack,

121
00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:33.510
a sleeping bag, an open ended ticket to India,

122
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.286
put a thousand dollars in my pocket,

123
00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:38.026
and landed in Delhi, India.

124
00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:42.702
And no idea where I was going.

125
00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:45.465
As I headed out of India on foot

126
00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:49.107
I would find myself at the end of each day,

127
00:05:49.107 --> 00:05:50.825
out of Delhi I should say,

128
00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:53.204
at the end of each day I was in a little village.

129
00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:55.979
And interestingly enough I never used my tent

130
00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.312
and I never, well I used my sleeping bag

131
00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:00.712
in the people's houses and huts,

132
00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:03.058
that I was invited to stay with these people.

133
00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:05.089
And each morning when I would get up

134
00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:07.420
an elderly gentleman would greet me

135
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.695
and he would draw me a map in the dirt

136
00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:11.495
and I would follow this map.

137
00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:13.419
And sure enough, at the end of the next day

138
00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.529
there was another village, same thing occurred.

139
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.500
And on and on and on for weeks.

140
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.341
And I got to what's known as the Punjab,

141
00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:22.663
the deserts of northern India,

142
00:06:22.663 --> 00:06:26.436
and I was thirsty and still following my urges

143
00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:28.175
and trusting everything.

144
00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:30.342
Couldn't speak a lick of Hindi.

145
00:06:30.342 --> 00:06:32.781
Had no idea what they were saying.

146
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:35.715
But when I got to the fringes of the Punjab

147
00:06:37.225 --> 00:06:39.688
I was thirsty, decided to have a cup of tea,

148
00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:42.590
went to a little roadside cafe, ordered a cup of tea,

149
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.860
sat down under a tree,

150
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.858
and as I was watching the people on this dirt road

151
00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:51.300
traveling, this voice behind me said

152
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.930
we've been waiting for you.

153
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.791
And I knew...

154
00:06:57.576 --> 00:06:59.833
I knew that nobody knew, excuse me,

155
00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:02.485
sensitivity to it.

156
00:07:02.485 --> 00:07:03.618
<v Voiceover>Powerful moments.</v>

157
00:07:03.618 --> 00:07:04.473
<v ->Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:08.080
I knew, or I thought nobody knew I was in India.

159
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.111
And I didn't even turn around, and the voice said again,

160
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:14.596
your name is Steven, is it not?

161
00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:19.197
Shocked.

162
00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:22.226
Slowly turned around and looked into

163
00:07:22.226 --> 00:07:24.797
the softest brown eyes I've ever seen.

164
00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:26.736
Turned out to be

165
00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.241
one of the greatest people I've ever met.

166
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.491
Master Lobsang.

167
00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:38.851
And he said to me, we've been waiting for you.

168
00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:41.785
And I said how did you know I was here?

169
00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:45.971
And he said we began calling you

170
00:07:46.557 --> 00:07:47.862
about six months ago

171
00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:49.864
and we knew that you would be here

172
00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:52.549
on this day at this time.

173
00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:55.695
And it was master Lobsang and master Kaila.

174
00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:58.595
And they looked at me and said you're here to learn.

175
00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:00.972
You're here to learn about consciousness.

176
00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:02.911
You're here to learn about life.

177
00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:05.976
And you're here to learn about one known as Isha.

178
00:08:05.976 --> 00:08:07.773
And I said, who was Isha?

179
00:08:07.773 --> 00:08:11.578
He said it is the one that you know as Jesus, he was here.

180
00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:15.246
And they basically said come with me.

181
00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:17.948
And the interesting thing, Regina, is I thought to myself

182
00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:19.826
well I've got a couple of months

183
00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:22.893
so I can do that.

184
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:25.630
And I headed off with them.

185
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.960
Little did I know it was going to be years later

186
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.568
before I returned to the United States.

187
00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:30.369
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

188
00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:33.230
<v ->So, and you can see how much it still touches me.</v>

189
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.375
<v Voiceover>Oh, it sounds magnificent.</v>

190
00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:38.379
Did they ever explain to you how they had identified you

191
00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:40.538
and why they had called you to begin with.

192
00:08:41.828 --> 00:08:44.017
<v ->Um, let me see if I can make this</v>

193
00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:46.571
kind of a short idea.

194
00:08:50.114 --> 00:08:52.177
They didn't know at first my name,

195
00:08:53.177 --> 00:08:57.221
but they use, monastic teachings teach the idea

196
00:08:57.221 --> 00:09:00.216
of oneness and consciousness and our connectedness to it.

197
00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.992
They knew, there's an ancient prophecy says

198
00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:07.167
that the mantle of wisdom will be passed from east to west.

199
00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:10.228
And what they did is they look for an energy type

200
00:09:10.228 --> 00:09:13.003
that was independent, and as I later found out

201
00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:14.675
was somewhat rebellious,

202
00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:17.627
and they ended up landing on me.

203
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.009
And to them, as Lobsang shared with me,

204
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:23.855
it was the only one that they found.

205
00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:29.484
And the whole monastery, the Darjeeling Monastery,

206
00:09:29.484 --> 00:09:32.929
would focus on that energy type

207
00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:35.035
until they actually got my name.

208
00:09:35.035 --> 00:09:37.137
And then they learned that I was in

209
00:09:37.137 --> 00:09:39.293
the northwestern United States,

210
00:09:39.293 --> 00:09:41.499
and they put all the energy there.

211
00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:44.105
And, as suggested earlier, Regina,

212
00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.879
that as each day progressed it was

213
00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:46.907
just stronger and stronger.

214
00:09:46.907 --> 00:09:48.862
<v Voiceover>So you can say there's no way you would have</v>

215
00:09:48.862 --> 00:09:50.748
stuck around for that graduation ceremony with that.

216
00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:51.601
<v ->No, I couldn't.</v>

217
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:54.269
Greatest move I ever made.

218
00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:58.570
Because they're astounding people.

219
00:10:00.654 --> 00:10:03.359
But they basically knew I was in India

220
00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:05.298
the day the jet touched the ground.

221
00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:07.596
And they left, I was about

222
00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:12.367
200 miles from the spot where we met

223
00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:15.235
and they were about 200 miles from the spot we met.

224
00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:17.476
And they knew the exact day.

225
00:10:17.476 --> 00:10:19.745
I mean, I hadn't been there more than,

226
00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:22.206
I had just got my tea, and had just sat down

227
00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:24.552
under the shade of a tree, set back

228
00:10:24.552 --> 00:10:26.281
and leaned against my backpack.

229
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:28.348
And that's when Lobsang spoke

230
00:10:28.348 --> 00:10:30.415
and he said we've been waiting for you.

231
00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:31.959
<v Voiceover>Right on time.</v>

232
00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:33.689
<v ->Yes ma'am. That's what he said.</v>

233
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:36.617
<v Voiceover>That's amazing.</v>

234
00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:39.165
<v ->Um, it's, I'm not the only one that's happened to.</v>

235
00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:40.233
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

236
00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:43.028
<v ->I think Kahlil Gibran had a similar event.</v>

237
00:10:43.028 --> 00:10:44.398
Very same thing.

238
00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:46.502
<v Voiceover>Now you're with them</v>

239
00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:49.500
and you're learning about, they pronounce it Isha?

240
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.669
Isha. Why did they choose to teach you

241
00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:57.243
about Jesus and his years that are called the lost years,

242
00:10:57.243 --> 00:10:59.350
(laughs) which is interesting in

243
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.080
and of itself metaphorically.

244
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.784
<v ->That's just a mystery that religion wanted</v>

245
00:11:03.784 --> 00:11:05.816
to build into it, the early Catholic church,

246
00:11:05.816 --> 00:11:07.685
to create the mystery of the Christ

247
00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:09.462
so that he would be the only one

248
00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:11.972
so to speak.

249
00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:15.193
Well, as it turns out,

250
00:11:16.323 --> 00:11:17.928
through my discussions with them,

251
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.333
they learned to understand that I was Catholic

252
00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:23.272
so what a more opportune moment

253
00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:25.126
than to shock a Catholic out of their

254
00:11:25.126 --> 00:11:27.042
dogmatic approach to life

255
00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:31.012
and show them what Christ was actually taught.

256
00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:35.256
And walk the same road, basically.

257
00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:38.922
Was shown and taught the same ideas and ideals.

258
00:11:38.922 --> 00:11:42.126
Sat in a cave and swam in a lake

259
00:11:42.126 --> 00:11:45.598
in Nepal that even to this day is known as Lake Isha,

260
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.808
where he spent time.

261
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.665
They singled me out, I guess,

262
00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:54.801
because of my openness and my desire.

263
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:57.538
I mean I wanted to find out who this guy was.

264
00:11:57.538 --> 00:12:00.615
I knew as a child going into church

265
00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:03.374
that the way they talked about this thing called God

266
00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:05.778
was only half the story

267
00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:09.417
because it's not a man, it can't be.

268
00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:12.224
Even if we look in the idea of the book of genesis,

269
00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:16.052
it literally states let us create human in our image

270
00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:18.499
and in our likeness, both male and female.

271
00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:20.690
So that gives us a very distinct message right there.

272
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.462
But I knew at seven and eight years old

273
00:12:23.462 --> 00:12:26.535
that this is not anything that Christ himself wanted.

274
00:12:26.535 --> 00:12:28.776
That that was not what he was about.

275
00:12:28.776 --> 00:12:31.641
I knew as a child that he didn't even like churches.

276
00:12:31.641 --> 00:12:35.240
So that was part of why they did indeed

277
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.350
single me out, because I already had that

278
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.731
as a platform.

279
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:40.949
And I wanted to know, and as I shared with you

280
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:42.885
before we began this process,

281
00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:45.079
my whole journey, even to this day,

282
00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:46.690
is about looking under every leaf,

283
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.308
every rock and every eye

284
00:12:48.308 --> 00:12:51.327
to find that hidden message or that secret.

285
00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:53.530
And I shared with you, there are none.

286
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.301
But if anybody goes to India just to prove

287
00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:59.099
or disprove the 18 years of

288
00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.501
Christ missing, they won't show them anything.

289
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:07.307
I remember in the Hemis monastery in Ladakh,

290
00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.179
when the abbot came up to me and he said

291
00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:11.674
your Isha was here.

292
00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:13.448
And I was with Lobsang and Kaila

293
00:13:13.448 --> 00:13:15.183
and I told them why I was there.

294
00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:19.354
And had the robes on, I was a monk

295
00:13:19.354 --> 00:13:21.984
for all intents and purpose.

296
00:13:21.984 --> 00:13:23.931
And they brought me the scrolls.

297
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:27.826
And I had my own interpreter and they read them to me

298
00:13:28.786 --> 00:13:31.732
about what he was doing, why he was even in Ladakh,

299
00:13:31.732 --> 00:13:34.565
why he spent times with the Jains, the Brahmans,

300
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:36.338
studying the vedas, the sutras,

301
00:13:36.338 --> 00:13:38.509
why he was in the community where

302
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:40.210
Buddha was born and raised,

303
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.381
and why he wanted to know all of that.

304
00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:44.552
And people go, Steven, it's not true.

305
00:13:45.802 --> 00:13:46.936
The book I'm working on now

306
00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:48.848
is the 12 Sacred Laws of Karma.

307
00:13:48.848 --> 00:13:52.215
Christ quotes them, all 12 of them, in the biblical text.

308
00:13:52.215 --> 00:13:53.950
He does them in his words.

309
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.026
But when you read what Buddha said

310
00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:58.162
500 years prior, and what Christ said

311
00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:03.325
500 years later, they're too strikingly similar to say.

312
00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:06.865
That now means he learned them somewhere.

313
00:14:06.865 --> 00:14:09.025
And my point and my shock was

314
00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:11.370
Christ was not born the way he was.

315
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.838
He was to a point, certainly, but he was taught

316
00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:17.134
how to do it.

317
00:14:17.778 --> 00:14:19.250
And that's what this individual attempts

318
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.880
to bring to this part of the world,

319
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.146
is that knowledge.

320
00:14:22.146 --> 00:14:24.984
<v Voiceover>So when you became exposed to</v>

321
00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:27.759
this new understanding of

322
00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:30.756
the one who walked the earth named Jesus,

323
00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:33.993
Jesus Christ, did this set your life on fire?

324
00:14:33.993 --> 00:14:37.798
What did this do to you by way of shaping

325
00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:39.265
what was going to come?

326
00:14:39.265 --> 00:14:41.875
Because you've written some incredible books

327
00:14:42.835 --> 00:14:44.905
based somewhat on that research.

328
00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:47.076
I mean, somewhat on what you learned at that time

329
00:14:47.076 --> 00:14:49.474
and then of course way beyond, you've studied everything.

330
00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:52.079
<v ->Well interestingly enough, I didn't know back then</v>

331
00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:53.714
I was doing this to write books.

332
00:14:55.154 --> 00:14:57.588
I was told by Lobsang that I would end up writing seven.

333
00:14:57.588 --> 00:14:59.059
That's actually my fourth.

334
00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:05.179
<v Voiceover>What happened to your, I guess I'm saying</v>

335
00:15:05.179 --> 00:15:07.181
what happened to your mind when you were exposed

336
00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:08.365
to this information?

337
00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:11.131
<v ->Peace. I was at peace with it.</v>

338
00:15:11.131 --> 00:15:13.232
It was like, Regina, I knew,

339
00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:14.358
I knew this.

340
00:15:14.358 --> 00:15:16.529
It was all familiar to me.

341
00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:19.304
I didn't know how or why at the time,

342
00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:22.377
but it was like I had been there, done that.

343
00:15:22.377 --> 00:15:25.115
It's like I had read these things, I had seen these things

344
00:15:25.115 --> 00:15:26.783
and had experienced these things.

345
00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:31.083
It was comforting

346
00:15:31.083 --> 00:15:33.037
to know that

347
00:15:35.214 --> 00:15:37.321
what I was studying was confirming

348
00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:39.225
what I had known since my birth.

349
00:15:40.485 --> 00:15:42.597
When everybody else told me I was...

350
00:15:42.597 --> 00:15:44.699
I can remember an experience in the fourth grade

351
00:15:45.859 --> 00:15:48.736
where I looked at my fourth grade teacher Miss Stevenson,

352
00:15:48.736 --> 00:15:50.811
we were looking at a map of the world flat,

353
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:52.097
and I looked at her and said

354
00:15:53.137 --> 00:15:55.024
it all used to be one island.

355
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.677
And I got chastised

356
00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:00.646
just like I did about my notions of the Christ.

357
00:16:00.646 --> 00:16:03.420
Of course we know today, as geology has confirmed,

358
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.648
that is correct.

359
00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:08.221
And as my teachers in India confirmed, that is correct.

360
00:16:08.221 --> 00:16:12.444
So it just brought, it was like okay.

361
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.764
<v Voiceover>Finally someone is telling me the truth.</v>

362
00:16:14.764 --> 00:16:16.101
<v ->Yeah absolutely.</v>

363
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.338
And being able to read it,

364
00:16:18.338 --> 00:16:20.997
and being able to literally stand at the

365
00:16:22.057 --> 00:16:24.444
base of Mount Nebo in Kashmir

366
00:16:24.444 --> 00:16:28.008
at a grave that I was told was Moses.

367
00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:29.345
Now isn't that interesting?

368
00:16:29.345 --> 00:16:30.907
<v Voiceover>Interesting, yes.</v>

369
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.654
<v ->Because Mount Nebo is also in the middle east</v>

370
00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:36.418
and supposedly that's where Moses was buried.

371
00:16:37.328 --> 00:16:40.219
But a monk has no reason to lie

372
00:16:40.219 --> 00:16:42.473
and they are meticulous record keepers.

373
00:16:42.473 --> 00:16:43.223
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

374
00:16:43.223 --> 00:16:45.063
<v ->If it creates a collision in religion</v>

375
00:16:45.063 --> 00:16:48.903
then I guess it's the dogmatic approaches dilemma.

376
00:16:48.903 --> 00:16:50.795
<v Voiceover>Yeah, let everyone else work that out.</v>

377
00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:51.570
<v ->Yes ma'am.</v>

378
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.332
<v Voiceover>And so, after your time with these studies,</v>

379
00:16:56.332 --> 00:16:58.407
and after your time with the monk

380
00:16:58.407 --> 00:17:00.378
that you so dearly love,

381
00:17:01.808 --> 00:17:03.177
how much time passed and then

382
00:17:03.177 --> 00:17:04.410
where did you go from there?

383
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.117
What happened to your life from that point?

384
00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:10.439
<v ->One day Lobsang, they had taught me to,</v>

385
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:14.940
through meditation,

386
00:17:16.594 --> 00:17:18.162
that leads towards what's known as

387
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:21.700
a samhadi experience or a bodhisattva experience.

388
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.463
It's reaching or coming to the realization

389
00:17:24.463 --> 00:17:25.899
of your own godhood.

390
00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:29.263
And I remember that I went up on the roof of the monastery

391
00:17:29.263 --> 00:17:31.536
late one afternoon in the fall,

392
00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:33.742
and began doing the meditation

393
00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:36.774
and didn't realize I was up there

394
00:17:36.774 --> 00:17:38.868
for well over five hours.

395
00:17:39.512 --> 00:17:41.058
And what had happened

396
00:17:41.058 --> 00:17:43.791
is I had broken the bond or the illusion

397
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:47.584
of a finite life and began to experience

398
00:17:47.584 --> 00:17:50.121
every single lifetime that I'd ever been here.

399
00:17:50.121 --> 00:17:53.163
Saw them. The births, the deaths, the conflicts.

400
00:17:53.163 --> 00:17:57.234
I was hung in the late 15th century

401
00:17:57.234 --> 00:18:00.435
as a highwayman because I held up the wrong carriage.

402
00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:02.235
And to actually see that

403
00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.578
is an interesting experience.

404
00:18:05.578 --> 00:18:07.477
And when I came down from the roof that day

405
00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:09.645
master Lobsang and Kaila both

406
00:18:10.975 --> 00:18:13.615
greeted me and they were smiling

407
00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:15.016
because they knew.

408
00:18:15.016 --> 00:18:15.953
<v Voiceover>You'd had your</v>

409
00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:16.694
<v ->Yeah.</v>

410
00:18:16.694 --> 00:18:17.480
<v Voiceover>Break.</v>

411
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.728
<v ->I had broken through the seven seals.</v>

412
00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:26.312
And Lobsang said, young man it's time for you to go home.

413
00:18:27.897 --> 00:18:30.302
<v Voiceover>How did you feel when he said those words?</v>

414
00:18:33.102 --> 00:18:34.357
<v ->You're seeing it.</v>

415
00:18:35.068 --> 00:18:36.800
<v Voiceover>Was it heartbreaking and honoring</v>

416
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.833
all at the same time?

417
00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:40.276
<v ->Well at first I didn't know why.</v>

418
00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:44.465
But he reminded me of the prophecy of the mantle

419
00:18:44.465 --> 00:18:46.610
being passed from east to west.

420
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.788
And he said now that the book of knowledge was known,

421
00:18:49.788 --> 00:18:51.820
it was time for me to share it.

422
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.100
So,

423
00:18:58.349 --> 00:19:01.663
I'm considering the wording, they escorted me to Delhi.

424
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.286
<v Voiceover>Why did you have to consider the wording?</v>

425
00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:09.576
Did they have to put you in shackles? (laughs)

426
00:19:09.576 --> 00:19:12.577
<v ->Almost. I absolutely did not want to leave.</v>

427
00:19:12.577 --> 00:19:14.641
I mean living in a monastery is an amazing life.

428
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:17.450
It's not all

429
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.745
total meditation and doing nothing.

430
00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:21.507
I mean that's what I believe a lot of people

431
00:19:21.507 --> 00:19:23.655
don't understand, it's a 24/7 job.

432
00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:26.383
You're planting fields, you're harvesting,

433
00:19:26.383 --> 00:19:28.124
you're working on the monastery,

434
00:19:28.124 --> 00:19:29.448
you're working on yourself,

435
00:19:29.448 --> 00:19:30.957
you're going through lessons,

436
00:19:34.107 --> 00:19:35.611
and at some point

437
00:19:37.189 --> 00:19:39.535
if you desire, I actually had a pet,

438
00:19:39.535 --> 00:19:43.166
he was a full grown Bengal tiger, 400 pounds.

439
00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:45.103
Well, it was the monasteries pet.

440
00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:46.474
<v Voiceover>I love Bengal tigers.</v>

441
00:19:47.424 --> 00:19:48.646
They're so beautiful.

442
00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.887
<v ->Yeah they are.</v>

443
00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:52.347
If you ever get to hear one purr.

444
00:19:52.347 --> 00:19:54.550
<v Voiceover>I have, I've been close to one. Yes.</v>

445
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.278
<v ->Then you know.</v>

446
00:19:56.418 --> 00:19:58.317
No, they walked with me to talk with me

447
00:19:58.317 --> 00:20:02.726
about why, because I really didn't want to leave.

448
00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.662
America was the furthest thing from my mind.

449
00:20:06.662 --> 00:20:10.769
And besides, they knew

450
00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:13.239
I was going to be in trouble with the authorities in India

451
00:20:13.239 --> 00:20:15.724
because of the passports and visas,

452
00:20:15.724 --> 00:20:18.740
and I hadn't checked in for almost four years.

453
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.922
(laughs)

454
00:20:20.922 --> 00:20:23.017
They wanted to explain to them, and they did,

455
00:20:23.017 --> 00:20:25.774
and I came back to the United States

456
00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:27.573
and then got absorbed in corporate America

457
00:20:27.573 --> 00:20:29.187
because they also informed me

458
00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:32.493
that what I would do was it would go dormant in me

459
00:20:32.493 --> 00:20:36.832
until I was in my mid 40s and I would have a dream

460
00:20:37.902 --> 00:20:39.833
and it would all come flooding back.

461
00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:42.500
And I was about 45 or 46 years old

462
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.362
and all of a sudden I had this vivid dream of Lobsang

463
00:20:46.362 --> 00:20:48.905
and all he said to me in this dream, his first words were

464
00:20:48.905 --> 00:20:51.409
it is time young man, awaken.

465
00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:57.212
And I walked away from a 230 thousand dollar a year job

466
00:20:57.212 --> 00:20:59.581
and said I can't do this anymore.

467
00:21:00.531 --> 00:21:03.255
Got my PhD and do what I do today.

468
00:21:03.255 --> 00:21:06.386
<v Voiceover>Okay now, there are some lost years.</v>

469
00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:08.557
(laughs) Let's go back.

470
00:21:09.497 --> 00:21:10.858
Steven's lost years.

471
00:21:10.858 --> 00:21:14.234
Okay, so you come back here and you said,

472
00:21:14.234 --> 00:21:16.768
you just mentioned you go into the corporate world.

473
00:21:16.768 --> 00:21:18.800
After an experience like that

474
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.506
there had to have been, you know,

475
00:21:22.506 --> 00:21:27.078
some boldness to that shift, but also what happened?

476
00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:28.343
How did that happen?

477
00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:31.109
<v ->The greatest lesson</v>

478
00:21:35.349 --> 00:21:37.551
that I as an individual had to achieve

479
00:21:37.551 --> 00:21:40.113
was to live the same lifestyle in this part of the world

480
00:21:41.483 --> 00:21:43.623
and overcome the pulls of life.

481
00:21:43.623 --> 00:21:47.361
The idea of money, success, the houses,

482
00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:50.458
the bank accounts, the suits.

483
00:21:51.688 --> 00:21:53.207
I had to come to the realization

484
00:21:53.207 --> 00:21:55.166
that there was no value in any of that.

485
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.562
So it was actually...

486
00:21:57.562 --> 00:21:59.071
<v Voiceover>But you spent a number of years</v>

487
00:21:59.071 --> 00:22:00.443
learning this it sounds like.

488
00:22:00.443 --> 00:22:01.241
<v ->14.</v>

489
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:02.338
<v Voiceover>14.</v>

490
00:22:02.338 --> 00:22:04.476
What did you, if you don't mind my asking

491
00:22:04.476 --> 00:22:06.180
although it sounds rather mundane at this point,

492
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.675
but what were you doing?

493
00:22:07.675 --> 00:22:10.748
<v ->In the electronics and computer industry, mainframe.</v>

494
00:22:10.748 --> 00:22:13.682
IBM, digital equipment, data general,

495
00:22:13.682 --> 00:22:16.662
doing design work even though

496
00:22:16.662 --> 00:22:19.890
I wasn't a double E, electrical engineer.

497
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.270
But designing computers for organizations

498
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.997
and corporations, but yeah.

499
00:22:26.577 --> 00:22:29.433
<v Voiceover>Okay, and you did well at it obviously.</v>

500
00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:31.276
And then did it go dormant?

501
00:22:31.276 --> 00:22:33.470
Did your knowledge go dormant?

502
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.974
<v ->No. How can we unknow what we know?</v>

503
00:22:35.974 --> 00:22:37.411
<v Voiceover>Exactly, so what did he mean</v>

504
00:22:37.411 --> 00:22:39.985
by the fact that you're going to forget

505
00:22:39.985 --> 00:22:40.842
or...

506
00:22:40.842 --> 00:22:42.879
<v ->I would get caught up in the corporate world</v>

507
00:22:42.879 --> 00:22:45.213
and the lifestyle of the American individual.

508
00:22:45.213 --> 00:22:46.220
<v Voiceover>And did you?</v>

509
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.747
<v ->Only to an extent</v>

510
00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:49.683
because there was a part of me

511
00:22:49.683 --> 00:22:51.793
that always felt out of place after that.

512
00:22:51.793 --> 00:22:55.387
But it also helped me perpetually

513
00:22:55.387 --> 00:22:58.736
keep a very calm cool mind in everything that I was doing.

514
00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:04.506
And as projected, literally,

515
00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:06.238
I said now I've had enough of this.

516
00:23:06.238 --> 00:23:08.069
It's time for me to do what I came to do.

517
00:23:08.069 --> 00:23:10.481
And I literally woke up one morning,

518
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:12.176
walked in to my area manager

519
00:23:12.176 --> 00:23:13.752
and said Bruce, I'm done.

520
00:23:13.752 --> 00:23:15.621
I don't want to do this any more.

521
00:23:15.621 --> 00:23:17.618
And he thought I was kidding.

522
00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:20.587
And I told him, I said, this is my two week notice.

523
00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:22.360
I came in two weeks later and

524
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.958
asked him if they had my final paper work all done

525
00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:27.323
and he looked at me and said no, I thought you were kidding.

526
00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:30.226
And I said, no. Send it to me.

527
00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:33.124
And I turned in my badge and my keys

528
00:23:33.124 --> 00:23:34.538
and I walked out the door.

529
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.674
I've never looked back.

530
00:23:36.674 --> 00:23:38.833
The only thing I've ever looked back at in my life

531
00:23:38.833 --> 00:23:41.109
is Lobsang and Kaila.

532
00:23:41.109 --> 00:23:43.614
And Santichai, which is the tiger.

533
00:23:44.774 --> 00:23:47.014
Santichai actually stands for peaceful tiger.

534
00:23:47.014 --> 00:23:48.453
That was his name.

535
00:23:51.243 --> 00:23:52.989
<v Voiceover>When you had the dream</v>

536
00:23:52.989 --> 00:23:55.424
and Lobsang came to you that night,

537
00:23:55.424 --> 00:23:58.716
and they sent you your papers, your final papers,

538
00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:01.296
what did you proceed to do at that point?

539
00:24:01.296 --> 00:24:04.266
<v ->Get my PhD in the field of metaphysics.</v>

540
00:24:05.876 --> 00:24:07.228
<v Voiceover>How does that happen?</v>

541
00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:11.610
<v ->When we look at the progression of life,</v>

542
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.172
and one of the things that I learned was,

543
00:24:13.172 --> 00:24:15.374
is there's always the obvious and the physical human

544
00:24:15.374 --> 00:24:17.534
always focuses on the obvious first.

545
00:24:18.854 --> 00:24:20.378
And then we have the belief system

546
00:24:20.378 --> 00:24:21.574
which is the undercurrent

547
00:24:21.574 --> 00:24:24.357
of the physical nature of the human.

548
00:24:24.357 --> 00:24:26.749
My Masters is in religion and theology.

549
00:24:26.749 --> 00:24:30.887
And then metaphysics is the field or study of causality.

550
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:32.739
What's the first cause?

551
00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:35.133
Why stuff happens.

552
00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.236
And that's the reason I did that.

553
00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:38.803
I didn't know what else to do.

554
00:24:39.883 --> 00:24:42.170
I began to get back deeply into my meditation

555
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.336
after I walked away from corporate America.

556
00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:48.843
And I had enough in the bank just to

557
00:24:49.763 --> 00:24:51.480
basically do very little.

558
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.919
And that's when I decided to get

559
00:24:54.089 --> 00:24:55.809
the doctorate in metaphysics.

560
00:24:56.679 --> 00:24:59.592
Because I felt that would close out the cycle for me.

561
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:03.118
And then after I got that I woke up one morning

562
00:25:03.118 --> 00:25:04.821
and went you know what?

563
00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:06.258
You don't have much money left.

564
00:25:06.258 --> 00:25:07.663
What are you gonna do?

565
00:25:07.663 --> 00:25:11.595
And I'm doing what I've always been,

566
00:25:11.595 --> 00:25:13.830
so to speak, destined to do.

567
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.230
I love people, interacting with people.

568
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.704
I love writing.

569
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.974
People ask me, what is my dream?

570
00:25:20.974 --> 00:25:23.250
And it's a small thing,

571
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.978
I would like to change the entire face of humankind.

572
00:25:27.488 --> 00:25:29.347
And I can only do that through me

573
00:25:29.347 --> 00:25:31.355
and through one person at a time.

574
00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:34.855
And in doing that I share the teachings I've learned

575
00:25:34.855 --> 00:25:37.124
in the corporate world and what I've learned

576
00:25:37.124 --> 00:25:38.665
from my teachers in India

577
00:25:38.665 --> 00:25:41.553
and from my interactions with everyday people

578
00:25:41.553 --> 00:25:42.932
that I meet on the street.

579
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.229
And that's what I'm after

580
00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:49.500
and that's what I will put my entire being into.

581
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.796
<v Voiceover>And you have been, and you began writing.</v>

582
00:25:51.796 --> 00:25:54.475
Now, did Lobsang tell you you were going to be writing

583
00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:56.806
those books before you left the monastery?

584
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:57.781
<v ->Yes.</v>

585
00:25:57.781 --> 00:26:00.054
<v Voiceover>And so, of course it wasn't a stretch</v>

586
00:26:00.054 --> 00:26:02.988
or to far a leap for you to say it's time to begin.

587
00:26:02.988 --> 00:26:04.752
Or did Lobsang come to you in a dream

588
00:26:04.752 --> 00:26:05.956
and tell you to begin?

589
00:26:05.956 --> 00:26:09.128
<v ->No, actually that didn't happen until later.</v>

590
00:26:10.228 --> 00:26:12.593
When he told me that I kind of rolled my eyes,

591
00:26:14.603 --> 00:26:18.296
there you go young man, just resisting again.

592
00:26:18.296 --> 00:26:21.463
And I had just remembered when he said that,

593
00:26:21.463 --> 00:26:24.435
that when I was in high school a 500 word essay

594
00:26:24.435 --> 00:26:25.944
was a stretch for me.

595
00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:29.682
I can remember going, 498, 499, 500,

596
00:26:29.682 --> 00:26:31.409
cool, there's my period right there.

597
00:26:31.409 --> 00:26:32.413
And I was done with it.

598
00:26:32.413 --> 00:26:34.580
I could not envision myself as a writer.

599
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.650
I've never taken journalism, never studied it.

600
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:42.285
But one day I went out and I bought a computer

601
00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:45.792
and I sat down in front of it

602
00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:48.813
and nothing came.

603
00:26:49.492 --> 00:26:51.799
And then four months later I sat back down

604
00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:53.204
in front of the computer and I couldn't

605
00:26:53.204 --> 00:26:54.766
keep my fingers off the keyboard.

606
00:26:54.766 --> 00:26:55.900
<v Voiceover>And what came out?</v>

607
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.774
<v ->The very first book I ever wrote, it's</v>

608
00:26:58.774 --> 00:27:00.876
Once Upon a Parable is the title,

609
00:27:00.876 --> 00:27:04.103
and it's acutally one huge Zen kwon.

610
00:27:04.103 --> 00:27:07.487
It's a 285 page Zen kwon.

611
00:27:07.487 --> 00:27:09.553
A kwon is a word puzzle.

612
00:27:09.553 --> 00:27:12.247
It's purpose is designed to make you think.

613
00:27:12.247 --> 00:27:15.289
And the whole book from beginning to end,

614
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:17.762
I've had people tell me they would open it, read it,

615
00:27:17.762 --> 00:27:19.190
and throw it in a corner.

616
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.533
And they would go back and pick it up,

617
00:27:20.533 --> 00:27:22.063
read it, and throw it in a corner.

618
00:27:22.063 --> 00:27:25.267
Because it makes you think about what you're doing,

619
00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:27.534
why are you doing what you're doing?

620
00:27:27.534 --> 00:27:30.270
It's purpose was designed to get people

621
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.403
to shift their life in a new direction.

622
00:27:32.403 --> 00:27:35.747
And monks use kwons to educate their students.

623
00:27:37.287 --> 00:27:38.617
And that was the first one.

624
00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:43.154
It actually, from beginning, the day I began writing it,

625
00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:47.292
with the help of my editor Chris Kamerer,

626
00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:50.427
until the day it was done was six months.

627
00:27:50.427 --> 00:27:53.858
And it was actually in printed form and out.

628
00:27:53.858 --> 00:27:55.193
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

629
00:27:55.193 --> 00:27:56.964
<v ->And the second one actually took a year</v>

630
00:27:56.964 --> 00:27:59.805
which is Messages from the Ancients,

631
00:27:59.805 --> 00:28:02.939
or Return to Innocence: Messages from the Ancients,

632
00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:07.374
which is a translation of the Nag Hammadi

633
00:28:07.374 --> 00:28:08.947
and the dead sea scrolls.

634
00:28:08.947 --> 00:28:10.139
<v Voiceover>Which you've held.</v>

635
00:28:10.139 --> 00:28:11.006
<v ->Yes.</v>

636
00:28:11.006 --> 00:28:12.079
<v Voiceover>In your own hands.</v>

637
00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:12.780
<v ->Yes ma'am.</v>

638
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.647
And it's because when you have a doctorate

639
00:28:15.647 --> 00:28:17.849
they kind of go oh, okay.

640
00:28:18.819 --> 00:28:20.760
And they give you the opportunity to do that.

641
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.558
But when you actually get to hold something that old

642
00:28:23.558 --> 00:28:26.060
in your own hands and read it for yourself

643
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.760
with nobody translating anything it's quite a shocker.

644
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.030
But the same was true when we went

645
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.763
to the Holy Cross Monastery deep in the Himalayas.

646
00:28:37.033 --> 00:28:39.713
Monasteries are fanatical record keepers.

647
00:28:39.713 --> 00:28:43.808
And they don't do it to stir difficulties or upheaval.

648
00:28:43.808 --> 00:28:46.986
They do it because they want

649
00:28:46.986 --> 00:28:49.712
the people of the future to know

650
00:28:49.712 --> 00:28:52.115
what the teachings are about.

651
00:28:52.115 --> 00:28:55.320
And when I held those scrolls talking about Isha

652
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.489
and what he was doing, I mean it was the same dynamic.

653
00:28:58.489 --> 00:29:00.660
It was like, wow.

654
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.069
<v Voiceover>When you say you read them yourself,</v>

655
00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:07.532
are you saying in Greek or Arabic, I mean Aramaic,

656
00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:10.337
or is it simply because you are so

657
00:29:10.337 --> 00:29:13.410
incredibly intuitive, you just downloaded it?

658
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.278
<v ->A little bit of both, (laughs) a little bit of both.</v>

659
00:29:15.278 --> 00:29:17.234
Actually, being candid with you,

660
00:29:17.234 --> 00:29:20.578
when I first began reading the scrolls

661
00:29:20.578 --> 00:29:21.921
in the Holy Cross Monastery

662
00:29:21.921 --> 00:29:23.718
and the Hemis Monastery in Ladakh,

663
00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:25.250
I had an interpreter.

664
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.521
And I asked him to read literal.

665
00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:31.922
I didn't want translation, and my intuitive part

666
00:29:31.922 --> 00:29:35.463
kicked in on what the message actually is.

667
00:29:36.753 --> 00:29:38.267
Because you see to me, ancients,

668
00:29:38.267 --> 00:29:40.272
and even in the dead sea scrolls and the Nag Hammadi,

669
00:29:40.272 --> 00:29:41.428
same thing happened.

670
00:29:41.428 --> 00:29:44.606
An interpreter, I want a literal translation.

671
00:29:46.426 --> 00:29:49.105
What I found in my experience is is ancients

672
00:29:49.965 --> 00:29:53.212
use right brain language to speak from.

673
00:29:54.082 --> 00:29:55.587
In other words, it's metaphorical.

674
00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:57.184
As an example, the biblical text.

675
00:29:57.184 --> 00:29:59.860
Every theologian on planet Earth including the pope,

676
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.822
will tell you that it's metaphorical

677
00:30:01.822 --> 00:30:03.955
and allegorical language.

678
00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:06.893
Well if it's metaphorical and allegorical

679
00:30:06.893 --> 00:30:08.724
then you can not take it in a literal

680
00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:10.802
left brain logical context.

681
00:30:10.802 --> 00:30:14.564
So any ancient text that anybody ever has their fingers on,

682
00:30:15.574 --> 00:30:17.304
if you want to interpret use your right brain

683
00:30:17.304 --> 00:30:19.669
intuitive creative side to read it

684
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:21.779
and it makes absolute implicit sense.

685
00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:23.544
Just a simple example,

686
00:30:23.544 --> 00:30:27.746
an ancient term jeru salem, which is actually two words,

687
00:30:27.746 --> 00:30:31.587
has been instituted today as Jerusalem.

688
00:30:31.587 --> 00:30:36.190
Jeru salem actually interprets into place of peace.

689
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.891
Your heart is your place of peace.

690
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:42.258
It's not a city, but today it's a city.

691
00:30:42.258 --> 00:30:45.358
All right? So what we've done is we've lost

692
00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:48.037
the metaphorical language of the ancients

693
00:30:48.037 --> 00:30:50.533
by taking them in a very left brain

694
00:30:50.533 --> 00:30:52.608
logical literal context.

695
00:30:52.608 --> 00:30:54.605
Well the whole message has been lost.

696
00:30:54.605 --> 00:30:57.341
But if you read even the biblical text

697
00:30:57.341 --> 00:30:59.547
through the right brain and look at

698
00:30:59.547 --> 00:31:01.277
the metaphorical language,

699
00:31:01.277 --> 00:31:05.422
you have to have some reference to what terminology means.

700
00:31:05.422 --> 00:31:07.486
But once you understand the terminology,

701
00:31:07.486 --> 00:31:09.459
Regina, it's universal.

702
00:31:09.459 --> 00:31:11.863
It doesn't matter whether it's written in the Vedas.

703
00:31:11.863 --> 00:31:14.367
It doesn't matter whether it's written in the Upanishads

704
00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:16.792
or the Buddhist sutras or the Vedanta.

705
00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:17.894
It doesn't matter.

706
00:31:17.894 --> 00:31:19.399
It doesn't matter whether it's written in the

707
00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:21.195
Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi,

708
00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:22.965
or even the biblical text.

709
00:31:22.965 --> 00:31:25.608
Because it's all transferable.

710
00:31:25.608 --> 00:31:28.273
The language is in essence the same.

711
00:31:28.273 --> 00:31:30.580
I can sit here and say to you this,

712
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.844
that if you read the Vedas

713
00:31:32.844 --> 00:31:34.513
which is the oldest known,

714
00:31:34.513 --> 00:31:36.320
four to five thousand year old text,

715
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.922
in the history of the world,

716
00:31:37.922 --> 00:31:41.394
and then you read the Bible after you read the Vedas,

717
00:31:41.394 --> 00:31:44.444
you're going to find the Veda principles in it.

718
00:31:45.644 --> 00:31:47.297
<v Voiceover>Then how did we come through our</v>

719
00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:48.861
modern day religions

720
00:31:48.861 --> 00:31:49.999
(laughs)

721
00:31:49.999 --> 00:31:53.406
to see ourselves as tiny little sinners

722
00:31:53.406 --> 00:31:55.937
and God is a harsh and judgmental being.

723
00:31:55.937 --> 00:31:59.846
Oh yeah, he can perhaps grant a few wishes but...

724
00:31:59.846 --> 00:32:01.367
(laughs)

725
00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:02.806
<v ->It'll actually give you anything you want.</v>

726
00:32:02.806 --> 00:32:04.950
Master Lobsang looked at me one day and said,

727
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.177
young man, what if you term,

728
00:32:08.857 --> 00:32:11.612
what if what you term as your God

729
00:32:11.612 --> 00:32:13.048
heard everything that you thought

730
00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:14.853
and considered that thought a request

731
00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:16.661
to give you that as an experience,

732
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:18.759
would you change the way that you think?

733
00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:21.023
And I said, yes master I would.

734
00:32:21.023 --> 00:32:23.937
And he said, good, because that is the truth.

735
00:32:23.937 --> 00:32:28.000
So, it doesn't do anything but give us

736
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.107
everything we ask for.

737
00:32:30.107 --> 00:32:32.600
And here's the funny thing, Regina,

738
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.282
it's literal, we're not.

739
00:32:35.282 --> 00:32:39.214
So when we ask for abundance and we're thinking lack,

740
00:32:39.214 --> 00:32:41.347
it gives us an abundance of lack

741
00:32:41.347 --> 00:32:42.984
because after all it does have

742
00:32:42.984 --> 00:32:45.082
an extremely divine sense of humor

743
00:32:45.082 --> 00:32:46.255
(interviewer laughs)

744
00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:47.889
in everything that it does.

745
00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:57.787
Around 485 BCE, or ACE,

746
00:32:59.427 --> 00:33:02.773
Constantine wanted to applaud

747
00:33:02.773 --> 00:33:04.910
his Christian soldiers so to speak.

748
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.671
And so he decided that they were going to adopt

749
00:33:08.671 --> 00:33:11.316
the Christian religion

750
00:33:11.316 --> 00:33:13.948
as the religion of Rome.

751
00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:15.350
And the real reason they did that

752
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.646
is because Rome was losing it's grip.

753
00:33:17.646 --> 00:33:21.326
People didn't believe in Rome anymore.

754
00:33:21.326 --> 00:33:23.625
So what they wanted to do was give

755
00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:26.223
humankind an external belief.

756
00:33:26.223 --> 00:33:28.661
Little did they know how much

757
00:33:28.661 --> 00:33:31.364
that was going to take hold of the human psyche,

758
00:33:31.364 --> 00:33:32.757
the human mind.

759
00:33:34.237 --> 00:33:37.038
And so what they did is they created an external God,

760
00:33:38.338 --> 00:33:40.436
a devil, what people don't realize is

761
00:33:40.436 --> 00:33:43.107
is the Bible as it stands actually was founded

762
00:33:43.107 --> 00:33:44.999
on four separate factions.

763
00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:47.112
And what Emperor Constantine did

764
00:33:47.112 --> 00:33:50.917
is they unified those four factions in the Nicaean council.

765
00:33:50.917 --> 00:33:53.584
First off, the Nicaean council was actually about

766
00:33:53.584 --> 00:33:56.089
what's this holy trinity thing?

767
00:33:56.089 --> 00:33:57.993
We've got to come up with a name for that,

768
00:33:57.993 --> 00:34:00.185
we've got to find a name to describe that.

769
00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:03.731
And once they did that, what they did is they

770
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:05.969
combined four factions.

771
00:34:05.969 --> 00:34:08.765
The Marcionites founded by Marcion

772
00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:13.674
and his teachings, there was a punishing God.

773
00:34:13.674 --> 00:34:17.147
And the Ebionites, which was the second faction,

774
00:34:17.147 --> 00:34:19.777
by the way all four of these were in conflict

775
00:34:19.777 --> 00:34:21.856
in ancient middle east.

776
00:34:21.856 --> 00:34:23.451
<v Voiceover>Always good to put that together</v>

777
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:25.142
in the same pot isn't it, in the teaching?

778
00:34:25.142 --> 00:34:26.323
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

779
00:34:26.323 --> 00:34:27.579
<v Voiceover>Internal conflict.</v>

780
00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:29.224
<v ->And that's exactly what they did.</v>

781
00:34:29.224 --> 00:34:33.795
Well the Ebionites had a greater God and a lesser God.

782
00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:37.533
And then they combined the Thomasines, Thomas,

783
00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:41.092
the apostle who was also in India with the Christ.

784
00:34:42.862 --> 00:34:45.605
And in fact there is a form of Christianity

785
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:48.508
on the eastern coast of India, but it's the Thomasines,

786
00:34:48.508 --> 00:34:50.075
not Christ.

787
00:34:50.075 --> 00:34:52.911
Because when the events occurred with the Christ,

788
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:56.715
should they be correct or true, Thomas went to India.

789
00:34:56.715 --> 00:35:00.146
And the fourth faction was the Gnostics

790
00:35:00.146 --> 00:35:01.955
founded by Mary Magdalene.

791
00:35:01.955 --> 00:35:04.381
And the Gnostic tradition, which is what

792
00:35:04.381 --> 00:35:06.390
the Nag Hammadi is based on.

793
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.490
In fact, there's an obscure text that's approved

794
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.971
by the Vatican, and didn't know it

795
00:35:11.971 --> 00:35:14.200
until I was writing about a physical

796
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.475
interpretation of the Bible.

797
00:35:15.475 --> 00:35:17.608
My supposition is is that Mary Magdalene

798
00:35:17.608 --> 00:35:19.802
actually wrote the gospel of John

799
00:35:21.422 --> 00:35:23.406
because it's very feminine in it's nature.

800
00:35:23.406 --> 00:35:26.680
And the only reason that Mary Magdalene was

801
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.279
turned into a prostitute, because the Bible

802
00:35:31.279 --> 00:35:34.027
doesn't say that, was because of insecurity

803
00:35:34.027 --> 00:35:36.488
of Pope Gregory because she was in

804
00:35:36.488 --> 00:35:38.215
direct conflict and their path

805
00:35:38.215 --> 00:35:40.697
was in direct conflict with the Catholic Church.

806
00:35:40.697 --> 00:35:45.233
So he termed her as a prostitute

807
00:35:45.233 --> 00:35:47.273
knowing nobody would follow her after that

808
00:35:47.273 --> 00:35:49.003
and that's exactly what happened.

809
00:35:49.003 --> 00:35:52.939
But interestingly enough, Mark, one of the four gospels,

810
00:35:52.939 --> 00:35:55.231
used to be the largest of the four gospels,

811
00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:58.273
but Pope Gregory actually removed over half of it

812
00:35:58.273 --> 00:36:00.816
and now it's one of the shortest gospels

813
00:36:00.816 --> 00:36:02.743
and we don't know what was in it.

814
00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:05.720
<v Voiceover>Now that is in the</v>

815
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.784
metaphysical interpretations of the Bible.

816
00:36:07.784 --> 00:36:09.850
And we're going to have another entire

817
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.189
conversation about just that.

818
00:36:12.189 --> 00:36:12.944
<v ->Sure.</v>

819
00:36:12.944 --> 00:36:14.323
<v Voiceover>Because this is too rich,</v>

820
00:36:14.323 --> 00:36:16.125
we can't do this all in one go.

821
00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:18.923
<v ->Okay. But you asked me about the journey</v>

822
00:36:18.923 --> 00:36:21.869
and I'm taking you through

823
00:36:21.869 --> 00:36:23.843
to where I am today and how I got

824
00:36:23.843 --> 00:36:25.441
what I got out of it.

825
00:36:25.441 --> 00:36:28.041
I apologize for getting a little bit off topic.

826
00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:29.631
<v Voiceover>No no, not at all, I just wanted</v>

827
00:36:29.631 --> 00:36:31.016
to let people know they're going to hear

828
00:36:31.016 --> 00:36:32.312
a lot more about this because we're

829
00:36:32.312 --> 00:36:34.671
doing a whole other piece on that.

830
00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:35.716
<v ->Good.</v>

831
00:36:35.716 --> 00:36:39.149
<v Voiceover>Now, you said some things a moment ago</v>

832
00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:40.252
I want to get back to.

833
00:36:40.252 --> 00:36:43.160
One of them was talking about this ability

834
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.422
to manifest very literally

835
00:36:45.422 --> 00:36:48.487
and how our minds have attached

836
00:36:48.487 --> 00:36:50.994
various concepts to this, and some of it

837
00:36:50.994 --> 00:36:54.066
has been made available to humanity

838
00:36:54.066 --> 00:36:56.198
through The Secret, for example.

839
00:36:56.198 --> 00:36:58.404
Many many many many, I mean,

840
00:36:58.404 --> 00:37:01.141
Tony Robbins, many different

841
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:02.705
messengers on this level.

842
00:37:02.705 --> 00:37:06.147
This is also an area that with your knowledge base

843
00:37:06.147 --> 00:37:08.376
you went into and you have developed

844
00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:10.556
a couple of CDs.

845
00:37:10.556 --> 00:37:13.316
Yeah, so tell us about that,

846
00:37:13.316 --> 00:37:14.617
what you had done in that.

847
00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:19.256
<v ->When you work with masters in the far east,</v>

848
00:37:19.256 --> 00:37:21.996
Lobsang and Kaila, they will shock you.

849
00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:25.998
I mean, when they first met me

850
00:37:25.998 --> 00:37:28.402
that day near the Punjab, their whole idea

851
00:37:28.402 --> 00:37:30.733
was to crumble every belief system I had.

852
00:37:31.923 --> 00:37:34.131
And through the months and years with them

853
00:37:34.131 --> 00:37:36.209
that's exactly what they continued to do.

854
00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:41.721
They literally demonstrated the power of manifestation

855
00:37:41.721 --> 00:37:43.715
in a very instant context.

856
00:37:43.715 --> 00:37:45.909
<v Voiceover>How so? Do you care to give examples?</v>

857
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:48.224
Are you allowed to?

858
00:37:49.174 --> 00:37:51.758
<v ->When you say it, people doubt, but know this,</v>

859
00:37:51.758 --> 00:37:53.926
theses eyes have seen people walk on water.

860
00:37:53.926 --> 00:37:57.626
They've seen water in a container freeze

861
00:37:57.626 --> 00:38:00.030
almost solidly in a matter of moments.

862
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.038
Music where there was no stereo.

863
00:38:02.038 --> 00:38:04.500
Food appear where there was none.

864
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.476
And I'm not the only one to see that and to know that.

865
00:38:08.476 --> 00:38:13.085
Baird Spalding, H.P. Blavotsky, Colonel Olcott,

866
00:38:14.185 --> 00:38:16.602
Kahlil Gibran, just to pick off a couple

867
00:38:16.602 --> 00:38:19.258
that I know off the top of my head have also seen this.

868
00:38:19.258 --> 00:38:21.325
But you have to understand, it's not something

869
00:38:21.325 --> 00:38:22.587
that they do to show off.

870
00:38:22.587 --> 00:38:24.756
If you do it to show off then it's ego based.

871
00:38:24.756 --> 00:38:27.493
And if it's ego based it just simply won't work.

872
00:38:28.583 --> 00:38:31.732
In essence, the power of manifesting is essentially this,

873
00:38:32.752 --> 00:38:35.602
let's look at the field of astrophysics for a moment.

874
00:38:35.602 --> 00:38:38.710
And in my dual CD set The Power of Thought

875
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.936
I go into great detail with this, but

876
00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:43.046
in essence here's how manifesting works.

877
00:38:43.046 --> 00:38:45.109
If we look in the field of astrophysics,

878
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:47.710
there's three, and three only,

879
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.714
constants in the entire cosmos. Three.

880
00:38:50.714 --> 00:38:52.989
The holy trinity if you will.

881
00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:55.927
Okay, which the Catholic Church has shifted.

882
00:38:57.277 --> 00:38:58.693
And by the way, they don't want us to know

883
00:38:58.693 --> 00:39:01.396
that we're capable of doing everything that Christ did.

884
00:39:01.396 --> 00:39:02.429
All right.

885
00:39:02.429 --> 00:39:03.887
<v Voiceover>That would seem apparent.</v>

886
00:39:03.887 --> 00:39:08.068
<v ->First off, you can find an electrical field</v>

887
00:39:08.898 --> 00:39:10.233
everywhere in the universe.

888
00:39:10.233 --> 00:39:12.526
You can find a magnetic field

889
00:39:12.526 --> 00:39:13.907
everywhere in the universe.

890
00:39:13.907 --> 00:39:15.971
And you can find a gravitational field

891
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:17.979
also everywhere in the universe.

892
00:39:17.979 --> 00:39:19.883
Well here's the intriguing thing,

893
00:39:21.163 --> 00:39:24.272
you, myself, and every single human

894
00:39:24.272 --> 00:39:27.218
on the face of this Earth are a living, breathing,

895
00:39:27.218 --> 00:39:31.920
thinking, feeling, walking electromagnetic field generator.

896
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.092
We are very literally an electromagnet.

897
00:39:36.092 --> 00:39:40.663
With that in mind, like attracts like.

898
00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:45.968
We draw to us the very every single experience that we have.

899
00:39:45.968 --> 00:39:49.181
But until every human assumes personal responsibility

900
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:53.047
for their experiences, i.e. removing the notion of blame,

901
00:39:53.047 --> 00:39:56.147
it cannot be utilized by them.

902
00:39:56.147 --> 00:40:00.025
Here's how it works, your emotional self, your heart,

903
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:04.491
is the electrical charge necessary for that magnet.

904
00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:07.022
Your mind is the steering mechanism

905
00:40:07.022 --> 00:40:09.031
and is the magnetic generator.

906
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:11.167
You put those two fields together,

907
00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:13.431
you now have an electromagnet which creates

908
00:40:13.431 --> 00:40:15.230
a gravitational field.

909
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.805
Once your gravitational field is created,

910
00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:20.565
the very thing you're seeking will come to you.

911
00:40:20.565 --> 00:40:22.678
You do not have to go to it.

912
00:40:22.678 --> 00:40:27.079
Now, how do we as humans utilize it more times than not?

913
00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:28.271
Simple.

914
00:40:29.271 --> 00:40:31.641
If you're at the beginning of the month and you realize

915
00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:34.660
you have to pay out 2000 dollars by the end of the month

916
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.587
and what you have is 500 dollars,

917
00:40:36.587 --> 00:40:39.919
what we do is we begin to worry about what we don't have.

918
00:40:39.919 --> 00:40:42.218
There's our electrical charge.

919
00:40:42.218 --> 00:40:45.062
Our mind is saying I don't have it, I don't have it,

920
00:40:45.062 --> 00:40:48.438
so what we're putting a magnetic charge now to,

921
00:40:48.438 --> 00:40:50.524
creating an electromagnetic field,

922
00:40:50.524 --> 00:40:54.274
is the idea of lack, drawing less to us.

923
00:40:55.274 --> 00:40:57.948
But if we turn it around

924
00:40:57.948 --> 00:41:00.177
and we focus it in the other direction

925
00:41:00.177 --> 00:41:02.650
and we focus all of that energy

926
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.005
on the end result only of what it is that we seek,

927
00:41:06.895 --> 00:41:10.120
it will find you just as my teachers in India

928
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.346
drew me to them and they later explained that to me.

929
00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:18.099
And that's in essence how it works.

930
00:41:19.819 --> 00:41:21.729
The key is, one of my students,

931
00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:24.939
I looked at her and said, I want you to think

932
00:41:24.939 --> 00:41:26.541
of a very simple phrase.

933
00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:29.711
I want you to love the idea of hearing that phrase

934
00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:30.846
and then let it go.

935
00:41:30.846 --> 00:41:33.037
And she called me one day and she said

936
00:41:33.037 --> 00:41:34.314
Steven, I don't get it.

937
00:41:34.314 --> 00:41:35.379
And I said, what?

938
00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:37.887
She goes, everywhere I go I see a pink Cadillac.

939
00:41:38.707 --> 00:41:40.920
And I start laughing, I say, well Carla,

940
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.790
what was your phrase?

941
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.654
I wanted a pink Cadillac.

942
00:41:45.654 --> 00:41:48.894
And I went, okay, what about that

943
00:41:48.894 --> 00:41:50.400
is it you don't get?

944
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.753
And she goes, but Steven, everywhere I go

945
00:41:53.763 --> 00:41:56.474
there's a different pink Cadillac.

946
00:41:56.474 --> 00:42:00.012
And I said, okay, drop the phrase out of your mind

947
00:42:00.012 --> 00:42:02.676
and replace it with something else.

948
00:42:02.676 --> 00:42:04.043
And she did.

949
00:42:04.043 --> 00:42:06.377
You see, right now you can think of something

950
00:42:06.377 --> 00:42:09.705
that you would like to hear, that you yourself

951
00:42:09.705 --> 00:42:12.988
would like to hear, make the phrase simple,

952
00:42:12.988 --> 00:42:16.552
focus on that phrase, love hearing that phrase,

953
00:42:16.552 --> 00:42:19.559
and make it a phrase that you do not hear very often.

954
00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:21.359
And then let it go.

955
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:24.662
And within 48 hours you will hear that phrase.

956
00:42:25.772 --> 00:42:27.762
And if you can do it with a simple phrase

957
00:42:27.762 --> 00:42:30.499
then you can do it with anything in the world.

958
00:42:30.499 --> 00:42:32.206
Absolutely anything.

959
00:42:32.206 --> 00:42:35.514
Now, if anybody viewing this and listening to this

960
00:42:35.514 --> 00:42:37.847
understands those three simple principles

961
00:42:37.847 --> 00:42:39.879
and then master your mind,

962
00:42:39.879 --> 00:42:42.128
you can have anything in this world that you want.

963
00:42:42.128 --> 00:42:43.855
<v Voiceover>And that's what the CD set is about?</v>

964
00:42:43.855 --> 00:42:44.737
<v ->Yes ma'am.</v>

965
00:42:45.387 --> 00:42:47.486
<v Voiceover>Sounds fantastic, I can't wait to hear it.</v>

966
00:42:48.496 --> 00:42:51.954
<v ->People say to me, do you think?</v>

967
00:42:52.954 --> 00:42:56.329
And I say to anyone that asks me that, no.

968
00:42:57.399 --> 00:42:59.501
My mind is absolutely free of thought

969
00:43:00.571 --> 00:43:04.211
until there's something I choose to think upon.

970
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:08.060
Then and only then is there a thought.

971
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.681
When you free your mind of thought

972
00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:13.885
it makes you extremely powerful

973
00:43:13.885 --> 00:43:17.705
because now your thought has pure intention.

974
00:43:18.705 --> 00:43:21.382
With it, behind it, created with it.

975
00:43:21.382 --> 00:43:24.827
And then your manifestation is instant.

976
00:43:24.827 --> 00:43:26.832
<v Voiceover>And we have monkey minds.</v>

977
00:43:26.832 --> 00:43:28.594
<v ->Well, as Buddha once said,</v>

978
00:43:28.594 --> 00:43:31.264
free your mind of all the chattering monkeys.

979
00:43:31.894 --> 00:43:32.834
Yes ma'am.

980
00:43:32.834 --> 00:43:35.293
<v Voiceover>And so that is part of what the CD set does?</v>

981
00:43:35.293 --> 00:43:36.233
<v ->Yes ma'am.</v>

982
00:43:36.233 --> 00:43:38.236
And the easiest key to that,

983
00:43:39.896 --> 00:43:43.005
if we wanted to get to the bottom line,

984
00:43:43.005 --> 00:43:46.151
always here's my suggestion to anybody listening out there,

985
00:43:46.151 --> 00:43:49.340
always keep your mind right behind your eyes.

986
00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.052
Where your eyes look, have your mind follow.

987
00:43:53.052 --> 00:43:54.415
<v Voiceover>Interesting. That's an</v>

988
00:43:54.415 --> 00:43:55.617
interesting way to put it.

989
00:43:55.617 --> 00:43:58.957
<v ->It's not easy at first, but it's easy ultimately.</v>

990
00:44:00.867 --> 00:44:03.392
<v Voiceover>That is truly being in the now also.</v>

991
00:44:03.392 --> 00:44:05.569
<v ->Being present, yes, absolutely.</v>

992
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:06.672
Absolutely.

993
00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.207
Have no hesitation with sharing with people

994
00:44:10.207 --> 00:44:11.992
that the mind is a magnificent thing

995
00:44:11.992 --> 00:44:14.732
and at the same time it's an extremely dangerous thing.

996
00:44:14.732 --> 00:44:17.843
Because if all of us took a moment and considered

997
00:44:17.843 --> 00:44:19.764
for one moment in time,

998
00:44:19.764 --> 00:44:22.644
every human in the entire world's

999
00:44:22.644 --> 00:44:27.322
life has their basis and how they see themselves

1000
00:44:27.322 --> 00:44:30.428
and how they allow their minds to do what they do.

1001
00:44:30.428 --> 00:44:33.359
No hesitation with looking at people and saying,

1002
00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:37.634
do you control your mind or does your mind control you?

1003
00:44:37.634 --> 00:44:41.297
98 percent will say I control my mind.

1004
00:44:41.987 --> 00:44:43.133
Exactly. No they don't.

1005
00:44:43.133 --> 00:44:44.233
<v Voiceover>It's the opposite.</v>

1006
00:44:44.233 --> 00:44:45.971
<v ->Yes ma'am. Totally.</v>

1007
00:44:45.971 --> 00:44:48.534
First gain control of the mind.

1008
00:44:48.534 --> 00:44:51.343
That's all the Christ did, that's all the Buddha did,

1009
00:44:51.343 --> 00:44:54.849
that's all any great teacher has ever done

1010
00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:56.379
in the history of the world.

1011
00:44:56.379 --> 00:44:58.423
They mastered their own selves.

1012
00:45:01.713 --> 00:45:04.726
If you were this thing that we call God,

1013
00:45:04.726 --> 00:45:07.822
you created all of this reality,

1014
00:45:07.822 --> 00:45:11.561
you created every living thing in this reality,

1015
00:45:11.561 --> 00:45:15.699
but your key to what you did and why you did it

1016
00:45:15.699 --> 00:45:17.800
was so that your creation would be

1017
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.270
just exactly like you.

1018
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.603
That would simply mean that you would

1019
00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:25.947
want them to seek how to become that.

1020
00:45:25.947 --> 00:45:28.977
So that now means you would hide it

1021
00:45:28.977 --> 00:45:32.356
and it also means that when you hide it

1022
00:45:33.526 --> 00:45:35.218
you would put it someplace.

1023
00:45:36.018 --> 00:45:37.522
So the question is,

1024
00:45:37.522 --> 00:45:41.292
how would you do it and where would you put it?

1025
00:45:41.292 --> 00:45:45.570
And interestingly enough, the answer came

1026
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.197
right out of Christ's mouth himself.

1027
00:45:48.197 --> 00:45:50.071
Here's what you would do,

1028
00:45:50.071 --> 00:45:52.033
you would make it so simple

1029
00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:56.872
that the logical mind would never be able to comprehend it.

1030
00:45:56.872 --> 00:46:00.120
The second thing you would do is you would put it

1031
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.046
right in plain sight because nobody would buy it.

1032
00:46:05.656 --> 00:46:07.974
And here's how that was arrived at:

1033
00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:10.560
Christ twice in the Book of Matthew says,

1034
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.684
along with Buddha,

1035
00:46:14.834 --> 00:46:18.094
says that you must have the mind of the child

1036
00:46:18.094 --> 00:46:19.870
to enter the kingdom.

1037
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.006
And he also says that you must have

1038
00:46:22.006 --> 00:46:24.096
the innocence of the child.

1039
00:46:25.336 --> 00:46:29.605
So in other words, it's you already,

1040
00:46:29.605 --> 00:46:32.745
it's myself, and it's every other living human.

1041
00:46:33.745 --> 00:46:35.274
How do we know that?

1042
00:46:35.274 --> 00:46:37.187
Let me ask you a question Regina.

1043
00:46:43.327 --> 00:46:47.094
Would you say that the creator is the epitome of perfection?

1044
00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.137
<v Voiceover>Well my mind goes into</v>

1045
00:46:52.137 --> 00:46:54.499
looking for the hidden question in that.

1046
00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:55.497
<v ->There's not one.</v>

1047
00:46:57.297 --> 00:46:59.001
<v Voiceover>What is? Yes.</v>

1048
00:46:59.001 --> 00:47:00.673
<v ->Okay. All right.</v>

1049
00:47:00.673 --> 00:47:04.464
So what we're being taught is the epitome of perfection

1050
00:47:04.464 --> 00:47:07.680
has created something that isn't.

1051
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.313
Now in a logical context,

1052
00:47:12.843 --> 00:47:15.980
if this creator is the epitome of perfection,

1053
00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.926
then if it doesn't create perfection

1054
00:47:18.926 --> 00:47:20.955
then that means it's a joke.

1055
00:47:21.885 --> 00:47:24.861
The other thing is if this thing that we term

1056
00:47:24.861 --> 00:47:28.469
as the creator didn't create inequality,

1057
00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:32.706
perfect equality, that would also make it a joke.

1058
00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:35.474
Now let's take that one step further.

1059
00:47:35.474 --> 00:47:39.177
It created even equal to it's own self

1060
00:47:40.427 --> 00:47:43.147
because in Matthew five the Christ also says,

1061
00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:47.122
you look here and you look there for the kingdom of heaven,

1062
00:47:47.122 --> 00:47:50.117
yet you do not know that it is within you.

1063
00:47:51.257 --> 00:47:54.061
And if God's in heaven, and heaven's within you,

1064
00:47:54.061 --> 00:47:58.064
then guess what, you are already what you seek.

1065
00:47:58.064 --> 00:47:59.036
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1066
00:47:59.036 --> 00:48:02.133
<v ->Master Kaila one day looked at me and said, young man,</v>

1067
00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:03.500
what do you seek?

1068
00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.905
I told him I wanted to be like Buddha,

1069
00:48:05.905 --> 00:48:07.678
I wanted to be like the Christ, Kuan Yin,

1070
00:48:07.678 --> 00:48:10.404
Tara, Lao-Tzu,

1071
00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:13.941
all of these great wise people.

1072
00:48:13.941 --> 00:48:16.783
And he looked at me and smiled and he said good,

1073
00:48:16.783 --> 00:48:18.618
you will never have it.

1074
00:48:19.588 --> 00:48:20.655
What?

1075
00:48:21.695 --> 00:48:24.043
And he looked at me and smiled and said this,

1076
00:48:24.863 --> 00:48:27.860
young man, as long as you seek a thing,

1077
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.328
it means you do not have what you seek.

1078
00:48:31.328 --> 00:48:35.461
But when you cease seeking it, it will find you.

1079
00:48:36.971 --> 00:48:38.989
I found that to be the case.

1080
00:48:40.234 --> 00:48:43.272
So you see, we all already

1081
00:48:44.302 --> 00:48:47.013
what we have always looked to be.

1082
00:48:47.973 --> 00:48:50.017
But because we think we're broke,

1083
00:48:50.017 --> 00:48:51.987
because we don't love ourselves,

1084
00:48:51.987 --> 00:48:54.193
and because we believe for some reason

1085
00:48:54.193 --> 00:48:56.724
that we're not perfect, then we cannot have

1086
00:48:56.724 --> 00:48:59.594
the very mechanism that was gifted us

1087
00:49:00.514 --> 00:49:02.833
since creation actually began.

1088
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:04.827
And we live in a world that's filled

1089
00:49:04.827 --> 00:49:06.565
with the struggles that we see.

1090
00:49:06.565 --> 00:49:08.864
Of course those are only a judgement

1091
00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:10.533
that we place upon it anyway.

1092
00:49:11.573 --> 00:49:12.791
Yes ma'am.

1093
00:49:13.377 --> 00:49:15.171
<v Voiceover>And on that</v>

1094
00:49:15.171 --> 00:49:18.474
I'm going to say thank you,

1095
00:49:18.474 --> 00:49:22.354
this has just been a beautiful time spent with you.

1096
00:49:22.354 --> 00:49:25.837
And your wisdom, and you're an unbelievable

1097
00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:27.279
intuitive to boot.

1098
00:49:27.279 --> 00:49:30.143
We chatted beforehand and, pretty amazing.

1099
00:49:30.143 --> 00:49:31.005
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1100
00:49:31.005 --> 00:49:33.033
<v Voiceover>You're right there, everything is right there</v>

1101
00:49:33.033 --> 00:49:34.658
dialed into all of it.

1102
00:49:34.658 --> 00:49:38.258
And what I'd like to do then is pick up a conversation

1103
00:49:38.258 --> 00:49:42.036
with you on the metaphysical interpretations of the Bible

1104
00:49:42.036 --> 00:49:44.366
because we need to unwind a lot of stuff there.

1105
00:49:44.366 --> 00:49:45.138
<v ->Okay.</v>

1106
00:49:45.138 --> 00:49:46.501
<v Voiceover>Until then, thank you.</v>

1107
00:49:46.501 --> 00:49:47.372
<v ->I appreciate it.</v>

1108
00:49:49.022 --> 00:49:51.770
<v ->This interview was a wonderful journey for me as well.</v>

1109
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:54.146
As I mentioned, Steven is a very talented psychic,

1110
00:49:54.146 --> 00:49:56.186
and his greater mind has been opened

1111
00:49:56.186 --> 00:49:57.580
to the grid of knowledge.

1112
00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.716
Not only does he share his knowledge in his books,

1113
00:49:59.716 --> 00:50:02.058
which you can find through Amazon or on his website,

1114
00:50:02.058 --> 00:50:04.792
but he also takes a small group of people to India

1115
00:50:04.792 --> 00:50:06.823
for their own awakening once a year.

1116
00:50:06.823 --> 00:50:09.667
He has seen much and will share more of his knowledge

1117
00:50:09.667 --> 00:50:11.429
in our interview with him next month.

1118
00:50:11.429 --> 00:50:14.064
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1119
00:50:14.064 --> 00:50:18.015
(peaceful music)
