00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.909
<v ->Ashok Gangadean is a very busy man.</v>

2
00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.269
He's taught philosophy at Haverford College for 38 years.

3
00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.588
He's co-chair of the World Wisdom Council, a television host

4
00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:14.748
and creator of a profound communication tool.

5
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.509
He says that we do not have the luxury

6
00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.809
of communicating with each other through our own

7
00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.488
narrow and heavily tinted filters anymore

8
00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:24.689
if we're going to turn the degradation of our planet around.

9
00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.409
In response to this challenge,

10
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.789
he's developed a method of communication called

11
00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.449
deep dialogue, which helps individuals

12
00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.069
as well as world governments see through the lens

13
00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:36.769
of a total stranger with differing views

14
00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.909
to identify our common desires

15
00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.639
and create genuine communication and compassion.

16
00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.289 line:15% 
<v Woman>Let's begin by talking about</v>

17
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.289 line:15% 
the World Wisdom Council first,

18
00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:54.609
and then the event that you've taken part in,

19
00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.948
which is a very elite group of minds from around the world.

20
00:00:57.948 --> 00:01:00.929
Ph.Ds in every imaginable subject coming together

21
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.589
in the spirit of finding a global unification

22
00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:08.669
of spirit and mind so we can start really looking at

23
00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:09.729
some of the problems.

24
00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.348
How did this all come together?

25
00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:14.229
<v ->Well, I think the universe wants it to happen,</v>

26
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:14.989
first of all.

27
00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.588
I mean we've reached a moment in our evolution

28
00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:19.649
in the 21st century where the globalization of

29
00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.329
worlds coming together has really called us

30
00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.229
and compressed us into a moment

31
00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.249
where we really need to hold a space

32
00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.848
for global wisdom.

33
00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:30.429
Many people have been feeling that need for a long time,

34
00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.089
and so an earlier organization that is still going on

35
00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:34.749
that was partner to this

36
00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:38.289
is working with leaders like Robert Muller from the UN

37
00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.869
and Karan Singh, a high-level statesman from India,

38
00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.869
Ewert Cousins, a really premiere, senior theologian

39
00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:50.489
from Fordham who has got 24 volumes of world spirituality

40
00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.129
bringing religions together,

41
00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.309
and I got together to form a world commission

42
00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:58.918
on global consciousness and spirituality.

43
00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.948
And what's a world commission on spirituality?

44
00:02:00.948 --> 00:02:03.889
In the UN, there have been all kinds of commissions

45
00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.929
to look at all kinds of problems,

46
00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.629
but several of us felt that the most important factor

47
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.109
of the human condition, consciousness, and where we are,

48
00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.729
there was no organization to help bring to the focus

49
00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.629
of the leadership of the world, and the grassroots,

50
00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.688
that consciousness matters.

51
00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:22.267
How we use are mind is the ultimate technology.

52
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.847
And all of our great wisdom teachers

53
00:02:23.847 --> 00:02:26.708
across the borders of the planet for centuries

54
00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:28.228
have been trying to teach us that

55
00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:30.528
when you're in the ego way of thinking,

56
00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.368
you have an ego-mental world,

57
00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:33.707
a divided fractured world.

58
00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:34.968
<v Woman>And what we're seeing today</v>

59
00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:37.248
exemplifies the ego-based world.

60
00:02:37.248 --> 00:02:38.107
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

61
00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:39.348
Even though our great teachers,

62
00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:41.788
whether it's in the Gita, or in Buddha's teaching,

63
00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:44.547
or in the Judaic founding of the Judaic religion,

64
00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:47.748
or Jesus, or Mohammed, just to mention a few,

65
00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:51.768
Lao Tzu in the Chinese, these are all great, gifted teachers

66
00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:55.147
that were seeing that human evolution doesn't get stuck

67
00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:58.968
in the ego way of separating the thinker from the object.

68
00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:00.428
<v Woman>Well now this is very interesting</v>

69
00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:01.747
if I can just interject something,

70
00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.428
because you've been a professor of philosophy

71
00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:04.748
for a very long time.

72
00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:07.367
Logic and ego oftentimes have accompanied

73
00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:10.488
that particular subject.

74
00:03:10.488 --> 00:03:12.868
And so how did you find your own way

75
00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:16.868
from really basing your thoughts more in the field of logic

76
00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:18.528
into spirituality and bridge this,

77
00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:20.407
going back into what you were just saying?

78
00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:21.908
<v ->Well yes, so that story is,</v>

79
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:24.728
I'm trained as a logician in the European tradition,

80
00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:26.208
before I had any acquaintance with Eastern thought,

81
00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:28.868
even though my ancestry comes from India,

82
00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:30.407
I was born in Trinidad and grew up in Jamaica

83
00:03:30.407 --> 00:03:31.788
in New York City,

84
00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:33.628
so I've really grown up in the West,

85
00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:35.248
and trained at Brandeis University,

86
00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.328
and my doctorate was in understanding

87
00:03:37.328 --> 00:03:40.248
the evolution of logic from Aristotle, Plato,

88
00:03:40.248 --> 00:03:42.808
all the way through to Bertrand Russell,

89
00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:47.048
Wittgenstein, and Frege in the modern analytic tradition.

90
00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:48.708
I was trying to find a coherent logic,

91
00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.708
and looking at the evolution of logic

92
00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:52.228
in the European tradition,

93
00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:53.908
and I found that it was really split between

94
00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:56.868
the Aristotelian lens that shaped our tradition,

95
00:03:56.868 --> 00:04:00.348
European tradition for millenia into the 20th century,

96
00:04:00.348 --> 00:04:02.928
and the new logic of mathematical orientation,

97
00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:05.128
of Russell, Wittgenstein, and Frege

98
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:09.008
that just closed the door on the classical logic I've noted

99
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:11.128
and opened up a new mathematical model.

100
00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:12.728
I saw them both, and they both had power,

101
00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:15.328
they repelled each other, and they both had validity.

102
00:04:15.328 --> 00:04:18.408
So my question as a young philosopher was

103
00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:21.388
if logic is a science of reason, of human intelligence,

104
00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:23.628
and it's polarized, what does that tell us

105
00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:25.968
about human intelligence and the capacity to cohere

106
00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.088
and to connect the dots and see unity

107
00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:29.888
in our understanding?

108
00:04:29.888 --> 00:04:32.728
So I felt that was a deep crisis in human reason.

109
00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:33.868
And that, fast forward is,

110
00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:37.168
I went to India after arriving at Haverford College

111
00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:40.528
as an analytic logician teaching this work

112
00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:43.968
and just as a cultural, spiritual journey to roots,

113
00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:46.568
I started studying Indian philosophy and music

114
00:04:46.568 --> 00:04:48.368
when I was there in University of Poona

115
00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:50.708
lecturing on my own work on Western logic.

116
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:53.408
And I was really blown away, when after

117
00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:56.408
the first serious encounter with Indian philosophy,

118
00:04:56.408 --> 00:04:59.068
began to see that meditative thinking,

119
00:04:59.068 --> 00:05:01.808
meditative awareness begins to become aware

120
00:05:01.808 --> 00:05:03.848
of how we use our mind.

121
00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:05.988
And there's such a thing as ego-minding,

122
00:05:05.988 --> 00:05:09.988
using the ego method, it's almost like a mental program

123
00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:13.028
where the thinker separates himself, herself from the object

124
00:05:13.028 --> 00:05:17.048
so you are someone, Regina, that I could look at

125
00:05:17.048 --> 00:05:19.948
and talk about and that I begin to put information

126
00:05:19.948 --> 00:05:23.408
about who you are and your identity as an object.

127
00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:25.688
We do this with everything including ourselves.

128
00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:28.928
And we don't become aware that we're using an ego lens.

129
00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:31.127
<v Woman>Separation by virtue of identity.</v>

130
00:05:31.127 --> 00:05:32.307
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

131
00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:34.287
Because when I separate myself as a thinker

132
00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:35.847
from what I think about,

133
00:05:35.847 --> 00:05:37.787
there is an I and not I,

134
00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:40.927
and the object that I think about is a not I,

135
00:05:40.927 --> 00:05:44.687
so there's already a separation between I and not I.

136
00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:47.307
When you go into the box or the screen of your awareness,

137
00:05:47.307 --> 00:05:49.107
you begin to also separate information

138
00:05:49.107 --> 00:05:50.807
between the subject and the predicate.

139
00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:53.327
You know, Regina is a woman, she is American,

140
00:05:53.327 --> 00:05:55.327
TV journalist, all these things,

141
00:05:55.327 --> 00:05:57.167
and you get the information and we build our identities

142
00:05:57.167 --> 00:05:58.587
in the box.

143
00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:00.467
And all of those pieces of information...

144
00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:01.467
<v Regina>Create separation.</v>

145
00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.207
<v ->That's right, space, and time, and mind, and matter,</v>

146
00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:05.047
and cause, all of them.

147
00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:08.027
And you're not aware that that level of thinking

148
00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:10.267
packages information and separates them

149
00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:11.787
and tries to put them together,

150
00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:13.787
alleging a unity, but they're not.

151
00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:16.387
<v Regina>And then you get to the macro lens,</v>

152
00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:19.427
which is them against us, them again us.

153
00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:20.987
<v ->Exactly, that's right.</v>

154
00:06:20.987 --> 00:06:22.027
Well then you see that's exactly right,

155
00:06:22.027 --> 00:06:25.027
because if I'm in, say, a Christian lens,

156
00:06:25.027 --> 00:06:26.907
and I see the world through Christian eyes,

157
00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:28.347
that's a worldview.

158
00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:31.427
If I see through Hindu eyes, that's another worldview.

159
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:34.427
If I see through Native American Lakota, that's different.

160
00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.647
If I see from a scientific perspective, right,

161
00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:38.487
if I see pro-choice, pro-life.

162
00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:39.947
Genesis, Big Bang.

163
00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:41.427
These are all different lenses.

164
00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:44.687
And we are not taught how to recognize the lenses,

165
00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:47.107
how to step back and morph our eyes

166
00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:49.167
into multiple alternative lenses.

167
00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.007
And that really, is what I've been working on

168
00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:53.147
for over three decades.

169
00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:56.167
To try and understand the dynamics of shifting awareness

170
00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.067
and changing our lenses.

171
00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:02.087
So if I'm raising the Judeo-Christian lens of seeing reality

172
00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:04.307
if I interpret all reality through my lens,

173
00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:05.747
and not aware of it,

174
00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.887
then I'm in a way doing violence to another

175
00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:10.927
if you are a Muslim, or if you are a Buddhist, or Hindu,

176
00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:13.387
or a scientist, I won't be able to see

177
00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:15.407
the world the way you see it.

178
00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:18.367
And we have the capacity to step back from our lens

179
00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:19.827
and check out the lenses,

180
00:07:19.827 --> 00:07:21.827
and change our mental ecology.

181
00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:22.827
<v Regina>We have the capacity,</v>

182
00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:24.807
but very few of us seem to be

183
00:07:24.807 --> 00:07:27.427
able to move beyond the lenses we were conditioned to.

184
00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:28.367
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

185
00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:29.727
<v Regina>So now what do we do?</v>

186
00:07:29.727 --> 00:07:32.704
We're in trouble. The planet is in trouble.

187
00:07:32.704 --> 00:07:34.744
There is almost no corner of the Earth

188
00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:36.044
<v ->There's no real dialogue.</v>

189
00:07:36.044 --> 00:07:38.284
<v Regina>...that doesn't have extreme challenges,</v>

190
00:07:38.284 --> 00:07:39.764
so we're so separate...
<v ->That's right.</v>

191
00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:41.424
<v Regina>Through politics, through culture,</v>

192
00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:42.704
through religion.

193
00:07:42.704 --> 00:07:45.824
What are you and the people that are working in this

194
00:07:45.824 --> 00:07:48.344
incredible council doing?

195
00:07:48.344 --> 00:07:50.124
<v ->So you set the stage well because,</v>

196
00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:52.244
so the World Commission on Global Consciousness

197
00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:54.664
is recognizing that when we step back

198
00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:55.904
from our local lens,

199
00:07:55.904 --> 00:07:59.064
and enter a global perspective, open the global lens,

200
00:07:59.064 --> 00:08:01.844
it is a deeper dimension of awareness,

201
00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:03.644
which all of our great teachers are trying to teach us

202
00:08:03.644 --> 00:08:05.964
how to open the global mind, the global lens,

203
00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:09.244
which means bringing different worlds and perspectives

204
00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:12.304
together in a unified understanding.

205
00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:13.504
So although I may be Christian,

206
00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:15.504
I can really understand the Buddhist perspective,

207
00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:17.964
and the Hindu perspective at the same time.

208
00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.304
I can dance in my intelligence

209
00:08:19.304 --> 00:08:20.644
to understand them.

210
00:08:20.644 --> 00:08:21.704
<v Regina>You can.</v>

211
00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:24.664
But for the average person, what is the hook

212
00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:28.404
that's going to make a person open up

213
00:08:28.404 --> 00:08:31.564
and care enough, or be curious enough even,

214
00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:34.084
to begin wanting to look through a different lens?

215
00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:36.524
<v ->I think events like 9/11,</v>

216
00:08:36.524 --> 00:08:40.184
which is a real clash of civilization, worldviews.

217
00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:41.644
We're living in this all the time.

218
00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:43.764
Relationships, where with your spouse,

219
00:08:43.764 --> 00:08:47.234
male-female, we have different perspectives often.

220
00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:50.333
In our political space, I'm pro-choice, you're pro-life,

221
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:52.273
there's some explosion taking place.

222
00:08:52.273 --> 00:08:55.953
In every aspect, and even an every day American,

223
00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:59.293
she may be Christian, so that's one worldview,

224
00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:00.393
I have one lens.

225
00:09:00.393 --> 00:09:02.153
But she's also a scientist,

226
00:09:02.153 --> 00:09:04.013
and she believes in the Big Bang.

227
00:09:04.013 --> 00:09:05.153
That's another lens.

228
00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:06.713
She's a civic American,

229
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.813
and she believes in the secular virtues

230
00:09:08.813 --> 00:09:10.553
of American democracy.

231
00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:15.553
Keep your religion out of politics, that's another lens.

232
00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:18.272
And so forth, and she may be seeing a therapist

233
00:09:18.272 --> 00:09:19.472
to try and sort all of this out.

234
00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:21.432
<v Regina>Right, or on Prozac.</v>

235
00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:23.432
<v ->Right, exactly. Or both.</v>

236
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:26.672
And see, the therapist may be a Jungian,

237
00:09:26.672 --> 00:09:28.332
teaching her that she's got a male and female

238
00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:30.692
anima and animus, it'll drive you nuts.

239
00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:33.612
So she takes yoga to try and chill out,

240
00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:35.472
and that's still another world.

241
00:09:35.472 --> 00:09:37.312
So we have multiple lenses.

242
00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:40.872
And the me as a Christian, and the me as a scientist,

243
00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.492
and the me as a civic American,

244
00:09:42.492 --> 00:09:44.272
they're different eyes.

245
00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:46.292
So I begin to become in pieces.

246
00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:48.212
<v Regina>So we're fragmented inside to begin with.</v>

247
00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:49.852
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

248
00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:53.512
So it's not just the West against the Muslim world,

249
00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:54.872
or the West against the East or anything.

250
00:09:54.872 --> 00:09:57.152
It's right here on our indigenous soil,

251
00:09:57.152 --> 00:09:59.672
on American civic space.

252
00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:01.052
We have multiple perspectives.

253
00:10:01.052 --> 00:10:02.232
<v Regina>And it's right here in our own bodies</v>

254
00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:03.552
in our own personal universes.

255
00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:04.972
<v ->Exactly.</v>

256
00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:07.412
And that packaging, when I see my body as one reality,

257
00:10:07.412 --> 00:10:08.952
and my consciousness as another,

258
00:10:08.952 --> 00:10:10.712
there's a mind-body split.

259
00:10:10.712 --> 00:10:12.152
And my consciousness is telling me one thing,

260
00:10:12.152 --> 00:10:13.872
and I don't listen to my body,

261
00:10:13.872 --> 00:10:15.212
and so there's this wrenching split

262
00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:17.512
and my health begins to be damaged.

263
00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:19.072
I'm under great stress.

264
00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:20.992
I'm living in ego time,

265
00:10:20.992 --> 00:10:23.872
and ego time divides past, present, and future.

266
00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:26.692
I'm plagued by wounds and hurts of my 30 years,

267
00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.072
so I'm trapped in the past.

268
00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:29.512
I can't show up now.

269
00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:31.212
I'm worried about my mortgage and my future,

270
00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:33.072
and I'm trapped in the future,

271
00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:34.552
and I can't live now.

272
00:10:34.552 --> 00:10:36.852
And all of the teachers say, how do you live now?

273
00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:40.532
You've got to open the lens and go to a deeper spacetime.

274
00:10:40.532 --> 00:10:43.132
A deeper time that has a boundless now.

275
00:10:43.132 --> 00:10:44.772
The power of now.

276
00:10:44.772 --> 00:10:48.372
So for example, all of Hindu thought is how to be here now.

277
00:10:48.372 --> 00:10:51.512
How to truly open up your mind and your body in unity

278
00:10:51.512 --> 00:10:52.852
and heal yourself.

279
00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.212
<v Regina>Which is interesting</v>

280
00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:56.532
because it seems as though, certainly Western culture,

281
00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:59.732
and now probably Eastern culture to a large extent as well,

282
00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:04.072
has a great fear of letting go of the planning

283
00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:05.672
and projection into the future

284
00:11:05.672 --> 00:11:08.752
for fear that the outcome will not turn out as planned.

285
00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.472
<v ->That's right. There's a lot of fear about...</v>

286
00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:12.332
<v Regina>Now how that we have an addiction to it,</v>

287
00:11:12.332 --> 00:11:13.872
we have a fear around everything having to do with

288
00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:17.692
personal security, so how do we begin shifting

289
00:11:17.692 --> 00:11:21.692
on the simplest level away from taking our mind off of

290
00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:23.532
gotta get that done before tomorrow,

291
00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:26.012
can't afford to lose that contract, or whatever,

292
00:11:26.012 --> 00:11:29.292
into being in the now?

293
00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:31.352
How would that look? How do you teach this?

294
00:11:31.352 --> 00:11:34.572
<v ->Well I think it's been taught by many different traditions</v>

295
00:11:34.572 --> 00:11:36.932
and so in the Zen tradition, Zen is all about

296
00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:41.272
through meditative awareness, slowing oneself down,

297
00:11:41.272 --> 00:11:44.512
and in a way finding a way to step back from the ego lens

298
00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:47.712
that really compresses you into this stressful way of being

299
00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:49.172
and fragments and separates,

300
00:11:49.172 --> 00:11:51.732
and starts to bring you into a more unified space.

301
00:11:51.732 --> 00:11:54.252
Because the basic insight is that reality

302
00:11:54.252 --> 00:11:58.472
is a connected, interconnected, deep, unified space.

303
00:11:58.472 --> 00:12:00.952
And when our minding, the way we use our mind,

304
00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:04.752
is also in sync with that, then we are attuned.

305
00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:05.961
Then we are in harmony.

306
00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:09.241
So in yoga for example, if you practice yoga,

307
00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:11.741
the first thing you do is breath, follow your breath.

308
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:14.201
And if you begin to follow as a basic principle

309
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:17.541
of beginning to sink into your body mindfully,

310
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.641
then it's a way of a technology helping you

311
00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:21.861
to arrive in the now.

312
00:12:21.861 --> 00:12:23.541
And that now is so expansive,

313
00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:25.781
it's Om, it's infinite now,

314
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:28.521
that it incorporates the past and the present and the future

315
00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:30.101
into presence.

316
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:31.221
<v Regina>Presence.</v>

317
00:12:31.221 --> 00:12:32.661
<v ->Not present, but presence.</v>

318
00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:34.501
So you have presence of mind,

319
00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:37.161
and you enter into the now in that expanded way.

320
00:12:37.161 --> 00:12:38.761
<v Regina>Let's take the woman you were talking about,</v>

321
00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:40.361
she's a scientist, she's a Christian,

322
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.721
she's a secular, civic citizen,

323
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.381
and she practices yoga, she's going to her therapist,

324
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:48.201
and she's on Prozac. (laughs)

325
00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:50.480
Let's take her...
<v ->Pretty typical. (laughs)</v>

326
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Regina>(laughs) Pretty typical.</v>

327
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.430
Let's take this woman, and look at,

328
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.860
from a micro point of view,

329
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.309
how you begin the transformative process,

330
00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.649
and then we're going to take it out into what you're doing

331
00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:02.769
in this global picture.

332
00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:05.249
Where do we begin, how would you take a person like that

333
00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:08.949
and begin guiding or coaching this person through

334
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:12.129
to their personal expansion into presence?

335
00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:13.789
<v ->Great question, and that's really,</v>

336
00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:15.329
my Global Dialogue Institute,

337
00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:18.089
Global Dialogue is the deepest form of dialogue,

338
00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.949
that allows us to take different worldviews or lenses,

339
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:23.789
and find the common ground across them

340
00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:25.869
without reducing their diversity.

341
00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:27.969
And the key to that is realizing,

342
00:13:27.969 --> 00:13:29.689
and what our great teachers saw,

343
00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:32.249
that at the deepest level, whatever name you use,

344
00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:35.749
whether you call it Tao, Om, Sunyata, Yaweh, Allah,

345
00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:37.369
nature, spirit...

346
00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:40.469
The name for the unifying force,

347
00:13:40.469 --> 00:13:42.889
by whatever language or dialect you use,

348
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:44.709
is a common unifying force,

349
00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:47.889
is seen to be boundless, and the source of all,

350
00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:50.409
and infinite, and if you think about it,

351
00:13:50.409 --> 00:13:51.529
it's a very simple point.

352
00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:53.169
There can't be two.

353
00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:55.229
Because if there were two, it wouldn't be infinite.

354
00:13:55.229 --> 00:13:56.849
It would be bounded by the other.

355
00:13:56.849 --> 00:13:57.969
So it's all encompassing.

356
00:13:57.969 --> 00:13:59.009
<v Regina>And it seems to thrive,</v>

357
00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:01.389
even to a biological level, on cooperation.

358
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:02.249
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

359
00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:03.609
Now see that's a key point,

360
00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:06.149
because if there is an infinite unifying force,

361
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:08.909
whether you call it Om, or Logos, or Yaweh,

362
00:14:08.909 --> 00:14:10.969
then that infinite force, if you begin to get into

363
00:14:10.969 --> 00:14:12.809
its technology and logic,

364
00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:14.549
this is what all our great teachers were showing,

365
00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:16.829
everything is interconnected,

366
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:19.649
and there's everything, meaning there's diversity.

367
00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:23.049
So there's boundless diversity in the unity.

368
00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:25.749
So the rhythm of that field is that the unified field

369
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:29.309
is a boundless expanse of boundless possibilities.

370
00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:32.349
So you would be a unique point, a power point,

371
00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:34.849
and center of that infinite field.

372
00:14:34.849 --> 00:14:35.989
I would be another.

373
00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:37.669
Each person has a sacred spot.

374
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.809
Each tree, each pebble, each grain of sand.

375
00:14:39.809 --> 00:14:43.809
Every item in that field reflects the entire field.

376
00:14:43.809 --> 00:14:44.909
<v Regina>So when you take something</v>

377
00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:48.249
and put it into that field that is egocentric by nature,

378
00:14:48.249 --> 00:14:51.329
and separatist by nature, then what happens?

379
00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:53.438
<v ->You violate that. You break it.</v>

380
00:14:53.438 --> 00:14:58.218
If you can imagine yourself in that interconnected space,

381
00:14:58.218 --> 00:15:00.958
I can speak my name in two ways.

382
00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.238
In the ego voice, where I separate myself off,

383
00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:04.998
and I've broken the circuits,

384
00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:06.898
and separate myself as a separate thing,

385
00:15:06.898 --> 00:15:08.818
and I'll lose my connectivity with you,

386
00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:10.078
with nature, with everything else,

387
00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:12.198
and the fallout begins to be that separation

388
00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:14.878
and breakdown, fragmentation, alienation.

389
00:15:14.878 --> 00:15:17.498
Whereas if I can now step back and reverse that

390
00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:19.098
and go into the integral,

391
00:15:19.098 --> 00:15:21.958
and begin to feel the interconnected Ashok,

392
00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.658
I'm connected with my breath...

393
00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:25.158
<v Regina>And feel our similarities.</v>

394
00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:27.158
<v ->That's right, because then in that space,</v>

395
00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:29.018
and by the way, just to interject,

396
00:15:29.018 --> 00:15:31.878
one thing I saw over the years in my research and journey

397
00:15:31.878 --> 00:15:35.138
was we needed to name when we were in the ego lens

398
00:15:35.138 --> 00:15:37.218
or the ego voice, as a technology.

399
00:15:37.218 --> 00:15:39.318
So just to mark it, I helped my students,

400
00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:41.218
for example, see that when you're speaking

401
00:15:41.218 --> 00:15:44.398
from the ego voice, mark it with a single bracket marker.

402
00:15:44.398 --> 00:15:47.238
Because that reminds you I'm speaking ego language.

403
00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.738
So when I say Ashok, my name, or use your name,

404
00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:51.858
I'm putting you in the ego space.

405
00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:55.258
<v Regina>And now doctor. Then you add doctor.</v>

406
00:15:55.258 --> 00:15:56.418
<v ->That's right.</v>

407
00:15:56.418 --> 00:15:58.118
<v Regina>And that's part of the identity at hand.</v>

408
00:15:58.118 --> 00:15:59.718
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

409
00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:02.158
Whereas when you go into the deeper space,

410
00:16:02.158 --> 00:16:05.378
the language works at a profound way of interconnectivity.

411
00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:08.078
The great teachers call it non-duo or duo,

412
00:16:08.078 --> 00:16:10.928
and I mark that with double brackets, double parentheses,

413
00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.698
to say when you're speaking, when Jesus is saying

414
00:16:12.698 --> 00:16:14.498
"I am the way, the truth, and the light,"

415
00:16:14.498 --> 00:16:17.008
he's speaking the Logos, he's speaking this...

416
00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:18.837
When Krishna speaks, when Buddha speaks,

417
00:16:18.837 --> 00:16:21.637
when Abraham is in dialogue with God,

418
00:16:21.637 --> 00:16:25.577
and the question of sacrificing Isaac, for example,

419
00:16:25.577 --> 00:16:27.297
and putting God first, he's struggling

420
00:16:27.297 --> 00:16:28.977
between this and that.

421
00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:31.157
So all of our great teachers and models

422
00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.857
were showing us, leave this,

423
00:16:33.857 --> 00:16:36.157
this disconnects, and leads to violence,

424
00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:37.797
and breakdown, and fragmentation within.

425
00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:38.957
<v Regina>So how do you introduce yourself</v>

426
00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.057
in double brackets?

427
00:16:40.057 --> 00:16:41.497
<v ->Well, getting back to your question,</v>

428
00:16:41.497 --> 00:16:43.037
this was just an aside.

429
00:16:43.037 --> 00:16:46.677
This woman exemplar we're talking about,

430
00:16:46.677 --> 00:16:50.137
let's say that she is struggling with

431
00:16:50.137 --> 00:16:52.897
how do I connect my Christianity,

432
00:16:52.897 --> 00:16:54.957
which tells me to love God in every moment

433
00:16:54.957 --> 00:16:58.017
and every breath in my life, and love my other,

434
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:01.057
for my politics, because we have politics facing my other.

435
00:17:01.057 --> 00:17:03.077
I may be Republican, I'm facing a Democrat,

436
00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:05.117
you know, I'm facing the other, my opponent.

437
00:17:05.117 --> 00:17:07.097
Jesus says love your other as yourself.

438
00:17:07.097 --> 00:17:08.877
How do I do that?

439
00:17:08.877 --> 00:17:10.837
And besides, how do I keep my religion

440
00:17:10.837 --> 00:17:12.157
out of my politics?

441
00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.027
I don't know how to do that.

442
00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:17.746
So we live in a tense situation.

443
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.586
Or you might say, my Christianity tells me life is sacred,

444
00:17:20.586 --> 00:17:22.326
so I'm pro-life.

445
00:17:22.326 --> 00:17:25.646
But my civic, democratic ways believe in freedom of choice,

446
00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:28.566
and there I feel, really, pro-choice is important.

447
00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:31.166
We die for choice. It's freedom.

448
00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:32.546
And I'm conflicted.

449
00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:34.346
Which am I, one or the other?

450
00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.926
Is it Big Bang that started, or Genesis?

451
00:17:36.926 --> 00:17:38.446
So whenever I'm facing,

452
00:17:38.446 --> 00:17:40.286
when I reach a point of maturity

453
00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:42.206
in my journey of polarity

454
00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:45.386
and realize these fragmentations are killing me,

455
00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:46.726
they're squeezing me.

456
00:17:46.726 --> 00:17:50.386
I'm longing to find common ground if possible.

457
00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:53.966
And that's where deep dialogue skills become important.

458
00:17:53.966 --> 00:17:55.406
What is that, how does that work?

459
00:17:55.406 --> 00:17:58.206
Well if I could step back from privileging

460
00:17:58.206 --> 00:18:00.566
the pro-choice as the only way,

461
00:18:00.566 --> 00:18:03.526
and begin to say, what is that pro-life person saying?

462
00:18:03.526 --> 00:18:05.386
What am I saying?

463
00:18:05.386 --> 00:18:07.395
And you begin to enter into that mental ecology,

464
00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:08.935
or that lens and try it out,

465
00:18:08.935 --> 00:18:11.435
and you begin to say, wow, life is sacred,

466
00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:13.955
and I can see that logic.

467
00:18:13.955 --> 00:18:16.195
But choice is sacred.

468
00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.255
But you know what, they're connected.

469
00:18:18.255 --> 00:18:21.035
Well something happens when you go into deep dialogue,

470
00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:23.495
that you begin to touch the deeper Logos

471
00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:26.135
that all of our different lenses come out of.

472
00:18:26.135 --> 00:18:27.635
That's the key.

473
00:18:27.635 --> 00:18:30.615
The deeper Logos, whether you call it Om, Yaweh, Christ,

474
00:18:30.615 --> 00:18:33.155
whatever, is the interconnected space where

475
00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:35.655
our intelligence finds connectivity,

476
00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:37.375
and that's when you find the link.

477
00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:40.295
So I may be Christian, and I know Jesus is the way,

478
00:18:40.295 --> 00:18:43.695
and I know for someone who follows Krishna,

479
00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:45.455
Krishna is the way,

480
00:18:45.455 --> 00:18:47.915
but I can go into the Krishna lens

481
00:18:47.915 --> 00:18:50.195
and see in that Hindu perspective,

482
00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.155
a very different mental ecology,

483
00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:53.985
and to understand in its terms how it does

484
00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:58.365
recognize Krishna as the incarnation of the Om,

485
00:18:58.365 --> 00:19:00.694
and the yoga technology.

486
00:19:00.694 --> 00:19:04.054
When I begin to make the transitions,

487
00:19:04.054 --> 00:19:05.654
which is what dialogue is,

488
00:19:05.654 --> 00:19:09.434
monologue is when I stand firm in my lens no matter what,

489
00:19:09.434 --> 00:19:11.954
and take the world and yank it through my lens

490
00:19:11.954 --> 00:19:15.214
no matter what, and violate the other through my lens.

491
00:19:15.214 --> 00:19:16.794
That's a kind of fundamentalism.

492
00:19:16.794 --> 00:19:18.874
I call it egomentalism.

493
00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:20.734
Egomentalism, by whatever faith,

494
00:19:20.734 --> 00:19:22.894
scientists can do it, when they see the world

495
00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:25.374
only from the scientific lens,

496
00:19:25.374 --> 00:19:27.474
so that if there's medicine, I'm a physician,

497
00:19:27.474 --> 00:19:30.074
I'm trained as a medical person,

498
00:19:30.074 --> 00:19:31.454
and I'm hearing about accupuncture

499
00:19:31.454 --> 00:19:34.354
and I say that's nonsense, it doesn't fit science.

500
00:19:34.354 --> 00:19:35.874
It's the same problem.

501
00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:39.224
And I'm not open to alternative modes of healing.

502
00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:42.334
So if I can go and understand a whole different worldview

503
00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:44.774
of accupuncture and the meridians,

504
00:19:44.774 --> 00:19:48.254
and it's not the same as physiology in my other lens.

505
00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:50.574
Or I go into the Aryuveda tradition of

506
00:19:50.574 --> 00:19:53.594
classical ancient Hindu medicine

507
00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:55.094
and understand the chakras,

508
00:19:55.094 --> 00:19:56.654
it's a different physiology.

509
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.314
It's a different way of understanding the energies,

510
00:19:58.314 --> 00:20:00.314
it's another dimension.

511
00:20:00.314 --> 00:20:02.274
And if I can begin, as a healer,

512
00:20:02.274 --> 00:20:05.254
to learn these different modalities and say, you know,

513
00:20:05.254 --> 00:20:08.694
they don't compete, they're coming out of a common source.

514
00:20:08.694 --> 00:20:10.614
<v Regina>And this is really the key,</v>

515
00:20:10.614 --> 00:20:12.753
if you go deep enough in your dialogue,

516
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.693
are you saying that you begin finding these essential

517
00:20:15.693 --> 00:20:17.273
or unified truths?

518
00:20:17.273 --> 00:20:19.433
<v ->Yes. Global truths.</v>

519
00:20:19.433 --> 00:20:20.833
That's global wisdom.

520
00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:22.993
Now we're back to the World Commission.

521
00:20:22.993 --> 00:20:24.882
<v Regina>So that's how you do it on a personal level.</v>

522
00:20:24.882 --> 00:20:28.282
You would begin by, let's just simplify her again,

523
00:20:28.282 --> 00:20:32.322
perhaps then meditation is a way to begin opening

524
00:20:32.322 --> 00:20:33.462
into these awarenesses.

525
00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:34.771
<v ->That's one way, but you don't have to...</v>

526
00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:37.031
That's one way to begin to experience

527
00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:39.211
the field of interconnectivity.

528
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:42.251
If you begin to practice some form of yoga, meditation,

529
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:44.391
Zen form, the many many forms of meditation.

530
00:20:44.391 --> 00:20:45.831
<v Regina>Something quieting and detached.</v>

531
00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:48.671
<v ->It helps you to settle back from your lens</v>

532
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:51.991
and experience the vibrations of the unified field.

533
00:20:51.991 --> 00:20:53.711
<v Regina>So you would advise this woman,</v>

534
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.631
begin with simple steps there.

535
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:57.431
Then of course, you have the deep dialogue.

536
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:00.131
<v ->And the dialogue becomes a more conscious way</v>

537
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.571
to articulate, you know.

538
00:21:02.571 --> 00:21:05.851
Let's say as a scientist, I begin to see now

539
00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:08.031
that the frontier of my physics,

540
00:21:08.031 --> 00:21:09.491
the physics of being able to see

541
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:11.711
that there's nonlocality in the universe.

542
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:13.631
We're going beyond the Einstein lens.

543
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:15.831
We're beginning to see the Butterfly Effect,

544
00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:17.511
that the movement of the wings of a butterfly

545
00:21:17.511 --> 00:21:20.111
in the rainforest of Brazil is affecting the tsunami,

546
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:21.471
and they're all interconnected.

547
00:21:21.471 --> 00:21:23.691
Well how is that? Interconnectivity.

548
00:21:23.691 --> 00:21:25.351
And the space-time continuum.

549
00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:27.051
Because when you go into the deep field,

550
00:21:27.051 --> 00:21:30.551
you don't chop the basic names like space, and time,

551
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:31.531
and mind, and matter.

552
00:21:31.531 --> 00:21:34.271
It's mindbody. That's a primal word.

553
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:35.931
So now when I speak of mindbody,

554
00:21:35.931 --> 00:21:38.351
I realize there's not a lot of split between

555
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:39.891
mind versus body.

556
00:21:39.891 --> 00:21:41.551
It's one energy field,

557
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:44.851
and my consciousness affects a cellular level.

558
00:21:44.851 --> 00:21:47.331
Now I can see how my intention
<v Regina>Intention, yes.</v>

559
00:21:47.331 --> 00:21:50.571
<v ->Can affect my biology and my physique,</v>

560
00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:52.451
and create illness or wellness,

561
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:54.391
depending on how I'm using my mind.

562
00:21:54.391 --> 00:21:57.651
The mystery is solved because of connectivity.

563
00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:01.951
So something begins to happen in many, many ways.

564
00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:03.791
<v Regina>And so that is on a personal level.</v>

565
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:05.471
Now let's go back to the global.

566
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:07.151
Does someone see just an entry point

567
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.051
so people can begin seeing...
<v ->No.</v>

568
00:22:09.051 --> 00:22:11.451
So the World Commission on Global Consciousness

569
00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:13.731
and Spirituality is recognizing

570
00:22:13.731 --> 00:22:17.431
that there's a wealth of resources and wisdom

571
00:22:17.431 --> 00:22:19.011
across our traditions.

572
00:22:19.011 --> 00:22:20.311
And if you can have a lens,

573
00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:21.571
if you don't just look at it locally,

574
00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:23.471
but you begin to open the global lens,

575
00:22:23.471 --> 00:22:24.771
this deeper space,

576
00:22:24.771 --> 00:22:28.071
you begin to see that that wealth of resources of wisdom

577
00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:31.771
echoes profound truths, common global truths.

578
00:22:31.771 --> 00:22:33.331
Like human rights.

579
00:22:33.331 --> 00:22:34.851
Every human being is sacred.

580
00:22:34.851 --> 00:22:36.191
Why?

581
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:38.111
Because in the interconnected field,

582
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:41.391
you and I are distinct, and yet one.

583
00:22:41.391 --> 00:22:42.571
What does that mean?

584
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:44.871
It means to tend to myself is to tend to you.

585
00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:46.991
What is that? Ethics.

586
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:48.231
So when Jesus would say,

587
00:22:48.231 --> 00:22:49.951
when I was in prison you visited me,

588
00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:51.311
when I was hungry you fed me,

589
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:53.571
the Disciples, still in the ego lens,

590
00:22:53.571 --> 00:22:55.091
why did we do this?

591
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:57.631
When you tended the least of mind,

592
00:22:57.631 --> 00:22:58.551
you tended to me.

593
00:22:58.551 --> 00:22:59.501
What does that mean?

594
00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:01.109
I and the other are connected.

595
00:23:01.109 --> 00:23:04.249
Love your enemy as yourself.

596
00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.589
What's the Buddhist version of the Dharma?

597
00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:09.469
Because of interconnectivity,

598
00:23:09.469 --> 00:23:11.649
you have to tend to the well being of all beings.

599
00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:13.989
Why? Interconnectivity.

600
00:23:13.989 --> 00:23:15.789
I cannot sever myself from you.

601
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:18.889
Ashok is Regina.

602
00:23:18.889 --> 00:23:21.729
And when you realize that principle,

603
00:23:21.729 --> 00:23:24.049
it opens up compassion.

604
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:24.849
What is compassion?

605
00:23:24.849 --> 00:23:26.309
It's not a sentiment.

606
00:23:26.309 --> 00:23:29.749
It is a mode of connectivity, deep dialogue.

607
00:23:29.749 --> 00:23:31.949
And what is dialogue? The I and thou.

608
00:23:31.949 --> 00:23:35.049
You are other, and I and thou.

609
00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:39.409
And so when I'm in the ethics of I-Thou,

610
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:42.309
which is basic ethics, I'm in the global mind.

611
00:23:42.309 --> 00:23:43.889
I'm in global consciousness.

612
00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:46.169
You can't be a moral being with an ego mind,

613
00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:48.029
because you objectify the other.

614
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:49.169
And when you objectify the other,

615
00:23:49.169 --> 00:23:52.089
you violate the other, it's an act of violence.

616
00:23:52.089 --> 00:23:54.549
So ego is a form of fragmentation and violence

617
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:56.189
to myself and to other,

618
00:23:56.189 --> 00:23:57.849
and you can't have a culture of peace,

619
00:23:57.849 --> 00:23:59.449
because you are fragmented within,

620
00:23:59.449 --> 00:24:01.189
your relationships are fragmented,

621
00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:03.689
your work with other cultures and worlds is broken.

622
00:24:03.689 --> 00:24:07.409
9/11s, genocides, Holocausts,

623
00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:09.729
the most devastating violence to people.

624
00:24:09.729 --> 00:24:11.749
And in our everyday relationships

625
00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:13.749
in the workplace and in the public place.

626
00:24:13.749 --> 00:24:14.849
Right here on the home soil.

627
00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:16.429
It's not just between cultures.

628
00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:20.269
So that egoing is the source of violence,

629
00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:24.489
and deep dialoguing is a source of compassion.

630
00:24:24.489 --> 00:24:26.229
<v Regina>So how is this applying</v>

631
00:24:26.229 --> 00:24:27.889
in your global forum?

632
00:24:27.889 --> 00:24:31.669
What are you all coming to by way of consensus,

633
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:33.369
and what are some of the ways in which

634
00:24:33.369 --> 00:24:35.629
you're seeing inroads to make progress?

635
00:24:35.629 --> 00:24:39.449
<v ->Now to take it to the macro level,</v>

636
00:24:39.449 --> 00:24:41.969
the World Commission on Global Consciousness,

637
00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:44.749
people like Jane Goodall and Wangari Maathai,

638
00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:47.089
who just won the Nobel Prize, His Holiness the Dalai Lama,

639
00:24:47.089 --> 00:24:49.059
is one of our seniors, Desmond Tutu...

640
00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:50.218
<v Regina>Gorbachev.</v>

641
00:24:50.218 --> 00:24:52.698
<v ->Gorbachev, you know, is part of the Wisdom Council.</v>

642
00:24:52.698 --> 00:24:53.978
What do they have in it?

643
00:24:53.978 --> 00:24:56.978
They all realize that we are in a global age.

644
00:24:56.978 --> 00:25:00.238
We need the global mind, which is global consciousness,

645
00:25:00.238 --> 00:25:02.758
to be global citizens across our borders.

646
00:25:02.758 --> 00:25:06.058
Why? Because we're one family, human family.

647
00:25:06.058 --> 00:25:08.778
And with ecology as well, it's not just the humans

648
00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:11.398
to privilege, but nature is sacred,

649
00:25:11.398 --> 00:25:12.838
and ecology and other species.

650
00:25:12.838 --> 00:25:15.598
Jane Goodall will remind us, tend to the other species,

651
00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:18.858
they have their life that must be respected.

652
00:25:18.858 --> 00:25:20.198
<v Regina>They have knowledge, they have wisdom.</v>

653
00:25:20.198 --> 00:25:21.738
<v ->Exactly right, that was her breakthrough.</v>

654
00:25:21.738 --> 00:25:23.898
And indigenous wisdom has seen that.

655
00:25:23.898 --> 00:25:27.698
Nature is sacred, the mountains, the river, the rainforest.

656
00:25:27.698 --> 00:25:29.978
When you begin to enter that global consciousness,

657
00:25:29.978 --> 00:25:32.478
you realize it's a different way to be human,

658
00:25:32.478 --> 00:25:36.178
and that the planet is divided between the old way

659
00:25:36.178 --> 00:25:40.058
still, despite millenia of teaching to the contrary,

660
00:25:40.058 --> 00:25:43.538
we're still profoundly locked in the egomental ways,

661
00:25:43.538 --> 00:25:45.218
producing an egomental world

662
00:25:45.218 --> 00:25:47.898
that has reached terrible crisis mode.

663
00:25:47.898 --> 00:25:49.718
It's unsustainable.

664
00:25:49.718 --> 00:25:51.418
And this is what the World Commission

665
00:25:51.418 --> 00:25:53.438
and the World Wisdom Council recognizes,

666
00:25:53.438 --> 00:25:55.158
that we're in the 21st century,

667
00:25:55.158 --> 00:25:58.918
this generation has to make a mass shift in consciousness,

668
00:25:58.918 --> 00:26:01.878
and finally fulfill our legacy of who we are,

669
00:26:01.878 --> 00:26:03.818
or else we're not going to be sustainable.

670
00:26:03.818 --> 00:26:05.038
That's what we have in common.

671
00:26:05.038 --> 00:26:06.678
And the technology of doing it

672
00:26:06.678 --> 00:26:09.958
is to cultivate ways of dialogue across our borders

673
00:26:09.958 --> 00:26:13.118
which is embodying ethics in the workplace,

674
00:26:13.118 --> 00:26:16.438
in the civic space, in our personal relationships

675
00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:19.578
with one another, of not to objectify one another.

676
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.358
So there's a common technology.

677
00:26:21.358 --> 00:26:23.738
When we become global and we dilate the global lens

678
00:26:23.738 --> 00:26:26.318
and the global mind, and we can hold multiple perspectives

679
00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:30.338
in this dance of dialogue, and have multiplicity,

680
00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:32.758
and yet see the common truths of connectivity,

681
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.818
we mature as rational beings, as moral beings,

682
00:26:35.818 --> 00:26:37.358
as civic beings.

683
00:26:37.358 --> 00:26:38.698
That's what we're trying to cultivate,

684
00:26:38.698 --> 00:26:40.658
and bring it out to a mass audience.

685
00:26:40.658 --> 00:26:44.778
So the strategy is that the simplest, most powerful,

686
00:26:44.778 --> 00:26:47.958
minimal condition to have that culture that's sustainable

687
00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:50.798
depends upon shifting the lens of the people

688
00:26:50.798 --> 00:26:53.978
from the old way that produces that fragmented world

689
00:26:53.978 --> 00:26:56.698
to the integral way that begins to bring forth

690
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.238
a world of compassion and caring.

691
00:26:58.238 --> 00:26:59.458
<v Regina>What are some of the more</v>

692
00:26:59.458 --> 00:27:01.738
ingenious ways that this might happen?

693
00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:03.938
Because this means, in essence,

694
00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:07.418
shifting media, shifting everything really.

695
00:27:07.418 --> 00:27:08.458
<v ->It does.</v>

696
00:27:08.458 --> 00:27:10.338
For example, education.

697
00:27:10.338 --> 00:27:13.398
We've had great, genius teachers like Maria Montessori,

698
00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:15.457
that would say that the child is not an object

699
00:27:15.457 --> 00:27:16.917
that you feed information into,

700
00:27:16.917 --> 00:27:18.417
but a sacred being.

701
00:27:18.417 --> 00:27:20.777
How do you design a classroom environment

702
00:27:20.777 --> 00:27:24.277
in which the child's sacred nature is allowed to flourish

703
00:27:24.277 --> 00:27:25.277
and blossom?

704
00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:26.597
Not to pour information

705
00:27:26.597 --> 00:27:29.137
and package that ego-mind with information,

706
00:27:29.137 --> 00:27:31.657
but to allow the whole being to come forth

707
00:27:31.657 --> 00:27:33.437
as an integral whole being.

708
00:27:33.437 --> 00:27:35.557
That's a different educational ecology

709
00:27:35.557 --> 00:27:37.257
and environment, a different classroom,

710
00:27:37.257 --> 00:27:39.477
that allows the child to develop,

711
00:27:39.477 --> 00:27:41.757
that's a deep dialogue classroom.

712
00:27:41.757 --> 00:27:44.297
Or Rudolf Steiner, the Waldorf School.

713
00:27:44.297 --> 00:27:46.237
Another version of that.

714
00:27:46.237 --> 00:27:48.957
The Quakers, you know I teach in a Quaker college,

715
00:27:48.957 --> 00:27:50.054
and the Quakers understood,

716
00:27:50.054 --> 00:27:51.834
they were double bracket,

717
00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:56.794
realizing that that's where the individual and the community

718
00:27:56.794 --> 00:27:57.834
are both primal.

719
00:27:57.834 --> 00:27:59.074
It's not one or the other.

720
00:27:59.074 --> 00:28:02.854
Because in the individual, the I is the thou,

721
00:28:02.854 --> 00:28:04.934
and so the community and the individual

722
00:28:04.934 --> 00:28:06.354
are both sacred.

723
00:28:06.354 --> 00:28:09.054
And to design a space, and the Quakers use,

724
00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:12.434
to redesign a sacred space that is not hierarchical,

725
00:28:12.434 --> 00:28:14.294
but is, we face each other,

726
00:28:14.294 --> 00:28:15.413
and we speak from the spirit,

727
00:28:15.413 --> 00:28:18.313
and each person ministers and has the power to do so,

728
00:28:18.313 --> 00:28:20.233
and the right to do so.

729
00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:23.033
These are just ways in which you can begin to see

730
00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:24.533
how would this be embodied.

731
00:28:24.533 --> 00:28:27.473
So in education, imagine shifting from

732
00:28:27.473 --> 00:28:31.533
an educational environment that forces information

733
00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:33.813
rather than transformation.

734
00:28:33.813 --> 00:28:35.513
I find when I was teaching the Baghavad Gita

735
00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:37.513
when I came back from India,

736
00:28:37.513 --> 00:28:39.593
the way I was trained was information.

737
00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:41.013
What is the logic, how do you predicate,

738
00:28:41.013 --> 00:28:42.073
how do you put information,

739
00:28:42.073 --> 00:28:45.193
and I was trying to teach the Gita in the box.

740
00:28:45.193 --> 00:28:46.913
And I realized this is not working

741
00:28:46.913 --> 00:28:48.233
because the whole point of the Gita

742
00:28:48.233 --> 00:28:49.693
is to realize that there is a box

743
00:28:49.693 --> 00:28:51.173
and you need to step out of it.

744
00:28:51.173 --> 00:28:53.993
And if I'm putting it in the box, I'm violating the text.

745
00:28:53.993 --> 00:28:55.993
So I had to redesign education

746
00:28:55.993 --> 00:28:57.913
so that students can experience this journey

747
00:28:57.913 --> 00:29:00.873
from the ego lens into the integral.

748
00:29:00.873 --> 00:29:02.853
And to try that out experimentally,

749
00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:05.973
and to listen to Krishna's voice in new ears,

750
00:29:05.973 --> 00:29:08.113
and to realize that there's a move from the ego lens

751
00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:11.553
to the integral, awakened, Om space, in that case,

752
00:29:11.553 --> 00:29:15.113
is a fundamental educational, transformative shift

753
00:29:15.113 --> 00:29:16.973
to integral education.

754
00:29:16.973 --> 00:29:20.753
And so by developing the skills of deep dialogue,

755
00:29:20.753 --> 00:29:23.192
so right in the Baghavad Gita, the dialogue between Krishna,

756
00:29:23.192 --> 00:29:25.952
the voice of Om, and Arjuna, the ego voice,

757
00:29:25.952 --> 00:29:28.172
it's all about the deep dialogue between the ego

758
00:29:28.172 --> 00:29:31.572
and the awakened, dilated consciousness.

759
00:29:31.572 --> 00:29:34.172
And you'll find the same thing in Buddhist thinking,

760
00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.892
Christian thinking, Judaic dialogues

761
00:29:36.892 --> 00:29:39.012
between Abraham and God, Moses and God,

762
00:29:39.012 --> 00:29:40.492
all the way through.

763
00:29:40.492 --> 00:29:44.282
<v Regina>Are there some simple concepts</v>

764
00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:47.091
where anybody can begin, anybody on this planet can begin?

765
00:29:47.091 --> 00:29:49.891
Something as simple as dropping judgment of one another.

766
00:29:49.891 --> 00:29:51.291
<v ->Beautiful. Exactly.</v>

767
00:29:51.291 --> 00:29:52.751
Because when you're an ego and you're always judging

768
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:53.991
according to your lens.

769
00:29:53.991 --> 00:29:55.211
What is dropping judgment?

770
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:57.531
Drop that lens. Step back.

771
00:29:57.531 --> 00:29:59.251
Allow space for the other.

772
00:29:59.251 --> 00:30:02.271
Don't be prejudiced. Prejudice is this, egoing.

773
00:30:02.271 --> 00:30:05.871
Because you're prejudiced by your lens.

774
00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:08.680
So if I see the Hindu from my Christian lens,

775
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.300
I don't even realize I'm seeing it through Christian eyes,

776
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.360
and I say reincarnation is nonsense.

777
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.560
Prana and yoga doesn't make sense.

778
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.900
Reincarnation is all such and such, you know,

779
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.460
and karma, you know, and you're violating that language.

780
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.800
It's an act of violence.

781
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.680
<v Regina>And I think most people,</v>

782
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.180
if they're being honest with themselves,

783
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.420
when we do go into judgment of others,

784
00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.320
we usually end up being embarrassed.

785
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.140
We usually end up making a fool of ourselves

786
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.960
because we really understand so little.

787
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.920
If we are truly being honest.

788
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.080
So it's not serving us. It's a simple place to begin

789
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.880
if you were going to start a billboard campaign,

790
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.400
we've got some of the people in this conference were saying

791
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.880
that they're looking at maybe ten years.

792
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.880
The next ten years are going to be the critical years.

793
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.140
We've gotta get a move on.

794
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.200
<v ->That's right, and that's where Wisdom Council,</v>

795
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.580
that's how it was formed.

796
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.720
The World Commission of these leaders

797
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.540
who said we have to hold this up as the highest priority

798
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.540
on the planet to really address our problems.

799
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.860
Consciousness matters.

800
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.920
Global Consciousness, as a commission,

801
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.600
joined with Ervin Laszlo, who became our co-chair,

802
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.660
and he was developing the Club of Budapest,

803
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.540
putting like-minded Nobel Laureates, and statesmen,

804
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.940
and celebrities together who believed in this

805
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.920
planetary consciousness, is what he said.

806
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.580
And when we joined our forces we saw

807
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.160
we need to connect and not divide our efforts.

808
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.100
And we formed the World Wisdom Council,

809
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.520
taking membership from both,

810
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.940
and bringing in new people,

811
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.040
and pushing it to a higher level of power,

812
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.140
and that really is exactly...

813
00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.860
Having these world leaders, all of whom see,

814
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.540
that shifting the lens of the people of the planet,

815
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.160
top level of leadership, grassroots level,

816
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.160
all levels of culture, is the highest urgency

817
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.960
to address the crisis, and we have a ten year timeframe.

818
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Regina>So media is going to be critical,</v>

819
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.980
and you're very vested in media,

820
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.400
in fact you're starting something new.

821
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.780
<v ->Well yes, the reason I went into...</v>

822
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.540
As a professor, it's unusual for a philosopher to,

823
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.920
but I saw ten years ago that the old way

824
00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.020
of being an academic philosopher in the 21st century,

825
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.600
now that we have new media forms,

826
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.539
is not only to write books, great books if you can,

827
00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:13.499
like Kant or Hegel,

828
00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:16.499
my first two books were modeled after these great geniuses

829
00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:18.019
whom I love and admire.

830
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.399
I tried to write the highest level of global reason,

831
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.899
those are my two books.

832
00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:22.599
The first one is called

833
00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:24.639
"Meditative Reason: Towards Universal Grammar",

834
00:32:24.639 --> 00:32:26.959
towards this deep, unified grammar.

835
00:32:26.959 --> 00:32:27.779
And the second was

836
00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:30.719
"Between Worlds: The Emergence of Global Reason",

837
00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:32.339
trying to lay the foundations

838
00:32:32.339 --> 00:32:35.319
for the shift in global intelligence and global reason.

839
00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:39.119
But I saw that you needed to reach out to massive audiences,

840
00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:41.359
and that the people are ready and hungry for this,

841
00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.199
and it has been centuries coming.

842
00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:45.059
We have a short fuse.

843
00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:49.319
So I felt that entering the mass media through television,

844
00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:52.699
so I had a dream of bringing this incredible event

845
00:32:52.699 --> 00:32:55.439
that's happening, there's a great awakening of the people

846
00:32:55.439 --> 00:32:58.079
stirring on the planet in every aspect,

847
00:32:58.079 --> 00:32:59.839
but it's not being shown.

848
00:32:59.839 --> 00:33:02.999
And even though it's the greatest event of our time.

849
00:33:02.999 --> 00:33:05.979
And so I felt that I had to move in that direction,

850
00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:09.639
to become a host, and produce television.

851
00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:12.099
I had a dream of ATV, Awakening TV,

852
00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:15.949
just as CNN would, round the clock, around the world.

853
00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:17.798
Imagine everywhere you go in the world,

854
00:33:17.798 --> 00:33:20.498
you go to Tokyo, you turn on ATV and you'll see,

855
00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.198
let's say the Dalai Lama in dialogue.

856
00:33:22.198 --> 00:33:23.618
Or you'll turn it on another time,

857
00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:26.078
and you'll see this integral medicine event happening

858
00:33:26.078 --> 00:33:27.758
in Washinton, D.C.

859
00:33:27.758 --> 00:33:32.018
Or this native spirituality with science in Albuquerque.

860
00:33:32.018 --> 00:33:33.538
Around the clock, going.

861
00:33:33.538 --> 00:33:35.318
And you begin to see, my god, something

862
00:33:35.318 --> 00:33:37.058
is profoundly shifting on the planet,

863
00:33:37.058 --> 00:33:38.098
now we can see it.

864
00:33:38.098 --> 00:33:40.898
And that then begins to feed the people who said

865
00:33:40.898 --> 00:33:42.558
I see what's happening.

866
00:33:42.558 --> 00:33:43.998
And it'll accelerate it.

867
00:33:43.998 --> 00:33:44.878
<v Regina>And this is underway,</v>

868
00:33:44.878 --> 00:33:46.698
you've already been, you've had your own television show

869
00:33:46.698 --> 00:33:49.118
for a while, but now this new endeavor is underway,

870
00:33:49.118 --> 00:33:49.898
isn't it?

871
00:33:49.898 --> 00:33:52.618
<v ->It's a double endeavor, because the World Wisdom Council,</v>

872
00:33:52.618 --> 00:33:56.518
realizing the urgency of moving in this timeframe,

873
00:33:56.518 --> 00:33:58.978
of trying to cultivate what's happening

874
00:33:58.978 --> 00:34:00.858
in this global civilization that's emerging,

875
00:34:00.858 --> 00:34:04.778
to accelerate it, we need to develop a wisdom channel,

876
00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:08.158
a global wisdom channel to bring the global wisdom out

877
00:34:08.158 --> 00:34:09.298
on a global scale.

878
00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:10.878
Now we can do it with internet,

879
00:34:10.878 --> 00:34:13.338
and I'm going to be playing a role in that,

880
00:34:13.338 --> 00:34:15.878
but I was just offered to become a producer

881
00:34:15.878 --> 00:34:20.878
of another channel on Cosmic Consciousness,

882
00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:25.538
and so they see that I'm developing programming there,

883
00:34:25.538 --> 00:34:27.438
and it's another form of ATV,

884
00:34:27.438 --> 00:34:29.798
so I'm now going to be the producer of that,

885
00:34:29.798 --> 00:34:32.258
and I'm going to be bringing programs all around

886
00:34:32.258 --> 00:34:34.358
that are already there and uniting them

887
00:34:34.358 --> 00:34:37.238
on this webcasting site.

888
00:34:37.238 --> 00:34:39.598
So all of these things are happening all at the same time.

889
00:34:39.598 --> 00:34:41.238
<v Regina>Yes they are, and I can't think of anybody</v>

890
00:34:41.238 --> 00:34:43.238
more well positioned and more articulate

891
00:34:43.238 --> 00:34:45.318
and coming more from the heart than yourself

892
00:34:45.318 --> 00:34:48.038
to really spearhead a lot of this media.

893
00:34:48.038 --> 00:34:49.938
<v ->Well fortunately I've found so many friends</v>

894
00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:52.378
now discovering what you're doing,

895
00:34:52.378 --> 00:34:54.118
and just being here in Sedona,

896
00:34:54.118 --> 00:34:56.398
I've discovered already today,

897
00:34:56.398 --> 00:35:00.058
one or two connections of different things happening,

898
00:35:00.058 --> 00:35:03.098
and everywhere I go, that's exciting, we're not alone.

899
00:35:03.098 --> 00:35:07.878
People are stirring, and to connect them

900
00:35:07.878 --> 00:35:10.218
multiplies exponentially the power,

901
00:35:10.218 --> 00:35:13.038
so there's almost an imperative of global consciousness,

902
00:35:13.038 --> 00:35:14.578
thou shalt network.

903
00:35:14.578 --> 00:35:16.398
<v Regina>Thou shalt network, absolutely.</v>

904
00:35:16.398 --> 00:35:18.298
<v ->It really is embodied consciousness.</v>

905
00:35:18.298 --> 00:35:20.658
If consciousness is connectivity,

906
00:35:20.658 --> 00:35:22.318
and you're doing something in your own way

907
00:35:22.318 --> 00:35:24.318
to promote media consciousness,

908
00:35:24.318 --> 00:35:26.598
and I'm doing something and we don't talk to each other,

909
00:35:26.598 --> 00:35:28.278
it's almost a derelict of our duty.

910
00:35:28.278 --> 00:35:30.098
<v Regina>And if evolution thrives on cooperation</v>

911
00:35:30.098 --> 00:35:33.478
in general, we have to begin cooperating with each other,

912
00:35:33.478 --> 00:35:35.218
across the board, in all systems.

913
00:35:35.218 --> 00:35:37.218
<v ->That's right, so we're really fulfilling the law of nature</v>

914
00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:39.158
of connectivity, so that's networking.

915
00:35:39.158 --> 00:35:40.378
<v Regina>Yes, it's networking.</v>

916
00:35:40.378 --> 00:35:42.918
<v ->And developments like internet</v>

917
00:35:42.918 --> 00:35:46.318
is a wonderful gift from the higher source.

918
00:35:46.318 --> 00:35:48.918
And we of course, humans, brought it through,

919
00:35:48.918 --> 00:35:53.518
but they're bringing through factors, modes of connectivity

920
00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:56.098
that are part of the laws of nature and reality,

921
00:35:56.098 --> 00:35:58.338
so it's an exciting time.

922
00:35:58.338 --> 00:35:59.638
<v Regina>It's a very exciting time,</v>

923
00:35:59.638 --> 00:36:00.958
and we all feel that the,

924
00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.558
we can all feel the clock ticking.

925
00:36:02.558 --> 00:36:05.478
Anybody watching this is already feeling the clock ticking.

926
00:36:05.478 --> 00:36:08.018
<v ->That's right, and everywhere I go in the world,</v>

927
00:36:08.018 --> 00:36:11.138
it's exciting to see these things accelerating,

928
00:36:11.138 --> 00:36:14.218
and it's a time to connect the dots and accelerate it,

929
00:36:14.218 --> 00:36:17.918
so we feel, in the World Wisdom Council,

930
00:36:17.918 --> 00:36:20.098
we were daring enough, perhaps a hubris,

931
00:36:20.098 --> 00:36:22.527
to announce in Tokyo that we are hereby

932
00:36:22.527 --> 00:36:24.787
entering our campaign, and we're not going to stop,

933
00:36:24.787 --> 00:36:27.987
to call forth a new global civilization

934
00:36:27.987 --> 00:36:31.567
based upon this consciousness of global connectivity.

935
00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.927
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

936
00:36:33.927 --> 00:36:35.527
<v ->Ashok has written a couple of books</v>

937
00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.067
on global communications,

938
00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:38.307
but as you've already picked up,

939
00:36:38.307 --> 00:36:40.307
these skills apply to individuals

940
00:36:40.307 --> 00:36:41.987
as much as world governments.
