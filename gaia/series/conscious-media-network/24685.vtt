00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Alex Grey is a cult
hero among many people

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.930 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual community for
his shockingly vivid artistic

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.080 align:middle line:84%
depictions of what a human
looks like energetically.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.120 align:middle line:84%
He paints women
giving birth, couples

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
making love, babies,
and other subjects

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.890 align:middle line:90%
with a freaky kind of aliveness.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Alex says that his work is
to help people understand

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that they are not
their bodies alone,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and that we're all connected
to a vast web of life.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
You took an incredibly
unconventional path

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to your mind expansion and
your discoveries in your 20s.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
With the energy people
have in their 20s,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
what advice would you give them?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
What is their charge
in terms of utilizing

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that for the betterment of
themselves or the whole?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
the questioning--

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the depth
of the questioning that's

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:90%
coming to people.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
What was coming to me
was probably starting out

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:90%
about self-inquiry.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do here?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:10%
How can my artwork--

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
which I'd already
decided I was an artist--

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:10%
how can my creative work serve a
higher purpose than just simply

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:10%
myself?

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that the various
wisdom traditions give us

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:10%
some tools.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:10%
We have thousands of years
of history of meditation

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:10%
and what that's done to help
people center themselves, get

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:10%
back into their heart
source, and to see

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:10%
how they're connected with
everyone, essentially,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:10%
and that consciousness is
the medium that moves us.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:10%
We have to become familiar with
what that is in our own lives,

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:10%
and what does it mean to bring
consciousness to our actions?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You went about
it, in one way,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:90%
very atypical and typical way.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
You had all of the energies
of someone 20, 21 years old,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.545 align:middle line:90%
and you explored everything.

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:90%
You went to the North Pole.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.753 align:middle line:90%
You shaved half your head.

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
You did everything that a
person that's seeking would do.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
What is there about that
magical energy of the 20s

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that can be done historically if
you're speaking to that group?

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that since
everything comes into question

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to doubt all
of the bull that you've been

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
handed by a superficial culture,
then it's the time for greatest

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:90%
invention and breakthrough--

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and potential
break down as well.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But those difficult lessons,
I suppose-- confronting

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:90%
the things that we most fear.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we don't quite
have a family yet,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and we may be just
working on getting

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:90%
a job, or something like that.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of at a
point where whatever risks

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:90%
you can take with your life--

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
like Julia Butterfly Hill.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
She's a great
example of somebody

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
who saw the deforestation
and did something about it,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and brought attention--

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:84%
worldwide attention-- to
deforestation and to how one

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:90%
individual--

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:90%
working with a support group--

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
can make a difference in just
making a gesture or a statement

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
toward a greater
conscience for humanity,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
because that seems
to be where it's at.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
If we're heading
toward a shutting

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
down of the web of life
because of the actions

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that are polluting and
destroying and upsetting

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
the balance of
nature, what can we

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
do, as individuals, to
act locally as we're

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
thinking on a global scale?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a time of
tremendous creativity.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So they have to vision in
the wildest ways possible,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
take themselves to extremes
to get in touch with what

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
it is that they can
contribute to making the world

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:90%
a better, more peaceful place.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Now let's take it a little
more to the other extreme.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
You have the boomers,
who, to an extent,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
appear to have bought into
a lot of the previous ways

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
of consumption,
waste, et cetera.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you go about speaking to
that group to inspire them to--

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:84%
in essence, teach an
old dog new tricks?

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
When people become comfortable
with the wastefulness

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.425 align:middle line:84%
of this particular culture,
how do you make them care?

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
What would you say to
them to make them care?

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Think of your grandchildren.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Think of your kids.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:10%
Think of the kind
of world that we

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:10%
want to leave for the
generations coming.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And do the boomers want to be
remembered as the generation

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that could have done something,
but didn't, toward the slide

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:90%
into self-destruction that--

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
we're at somewhat
critical times, I feel.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you expand on that?

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Your vision of how critical
it truly is at this time.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
Mother Earth will heal from

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:90%
practically any wound.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
It will be like a blip on
the timescale cosmically.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to stay around
for another 1,000 years

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and excel as a species,
I think that we're

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
at that troubled
time of adolescence--

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:90%
not quite in our 20s yet--

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
as a species, where consumption
and addiction to oil

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and a variety of
other things is--

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
there's no moral center, it
doesn't seem, to our actions,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:90%
to the way that we treat nature.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't see our
connectedness with everyone

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:90%
and with everything.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the simple reverence
for life and morality of love

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and the ethic that makes us want
to bring benefit to the world

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
rather than extract whatever
we can during our brief sojourn

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that's what I think
that the wisdom

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
traditions and the meditation
naturally brings about--

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
is reclaiming that center
of compassion, and hopefully

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
wisdom, that will allow us
to bring creative action

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
into play, and
really may help us

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:90%
at this kind of "tippy" time.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting here
with our broadband

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and the technological
advances that

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
are astonishing, and
truly important to making

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:90%
the global consciousness dawn.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to find ways of
flying under the radar

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
of corporate media that
have their own agenda,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and look toward the agenda
of what would bring the most

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
benefit to the most people
and the most beings on Earth?

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying,
that naturally

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
starts to dawn in people
when they look inside

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and find that source of
wisdom and compassion

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:84%
that's been the
mystic core that is

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
seen through the various
wisdom traditions.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the anomaly
that's occurring at this time

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:90%
in history--

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
that's creating the new
paradigm, or the need

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:90%
for the new paradigm?

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
it's an awakening

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to our interconnectedness.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It's an understanding
of the meshwork

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of being from a very
personal standpoint.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that the mystics
were very few and far between,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and that their insights were
regarded as somewhat mad.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
To say, "Thou art that" is
to have a basic confusion.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
No, you're not the same
as the swimming pool

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:90%
or the truck that's driving by.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But on a deeper and
more fundamental level,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:90%
there is a sense of connection.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, in
the web of life,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be sitting
here a gibbering collection

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of molecules if it weren't for
the cosmos evolving just as it

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
has for the billions
of years that

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
brought us to this point of
evolutionary concrescence.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And so to be in touch with
one zone-- impermanence--

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and to consider what actions
one can take creatively,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and what talents we all have--
because we're all born with

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
certain innate talents that
we have to realize and use--

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and to consider the whole
"bodhisattvic" ideal,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:84%
which is basically
that you're here

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:90%
to bring benefit to the world.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
The influence of the Tibetan
Buddhist approach has been

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
profound in my life and my art,
and I've tried to integrate--

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
as far as possible-- this
"bodhisattvic" ideal of--

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.645 align:middle line:84%
it's a vow to bring liberation
and benefit to all beings.

00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you're vowing to bring
liberation to all beings,

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:90%
does that include the ants, too?

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Gee, whiz.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
That's an awesome vow, and
it transcends one lifetime,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can bring
a bit of that motivation

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to your artwork, or to
any creative endeavor,

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or to your voting,
or however you best

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
can serve the greater
good, I think that that's

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:90%
a very sturdy ethical basis.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
one of the places where

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:90%
we have to recalibrate.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Certainly in contemporary
art, the question

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
of morality and
ethics and things

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:90%
like that rarely comes up.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I suppose it's a whipping boy,
or something, for the Hollywood

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that, every once in a while,
gets trotted out in Congress.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
What's too violent, or
what's too sexy or something?

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really an
issue in contemporary art,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
real central mythos

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:90%
to America besides capitalism.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the art world
has become filled

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
with commodity merchants,
just like the shopping malls.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And so partly what
I'm trying to do

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
is reframe the way
that we look at art,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we started
this Chapel of Sacred Mirrors.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:90%
That was the point--

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to create a space that was
not determined by a museum

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:84%
or by considering the
artwork as a commodity--

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
so it's not a
commercial gallery.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:90%
So we do what we can.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it that the groups
Nirvana, and Beastie Boys,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and now Tool have
found in your work?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
inspiring them?

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the, I think,
great things about those

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:90%
particular performers--

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
certainly the Beastie
Boys and Tool--

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:84%
was that you see, in the
arc of their development

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:84%
as artists, that
there's an increasingly

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
deeper and spiritual message
that is coming through

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:90%
in their work.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they can't
also channel rage and humor,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:84%
but that isn't the
central point of the work.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
With the Beastie Boys,
it wasn't just fighting

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:90%
for your right to party anymore.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It was about integrating
the Bodhisattva's vow

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
into an amazing
coalescence of the world

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:90%
wisdom and incredible beats.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And so with Tool, they're this
extremely hard, heavy metal,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
driving, inventive art rock
group that is bringing,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, a profound
and direct message

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to thousands, maybe
millions of young people.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:90%
I love their work.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I was very proud and honored
to be associated with it.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
According to Adam,
the guitar player--

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
who's also their
visual designer--

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I worked with him on all
the different projects,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
from the CD to the
music video that I

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
did with them, to the various
stage banners and things.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And in our conversations, he had
given "The Mission of Art" book

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
that I had written
to his bandmates,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%
and they had found value in it.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
they see themselves

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.840 align:middle line:84%
in a position in culture to
affect people on a deep level.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a shamanic kind of
relationship, I think.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
The rock and roll performers
are, for better or worse,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:90%
the shaman of our culture.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they can take people to
a place of just entertainment

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and keep it on a pretty shallow
level, or go pretty deep.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
And a number of them do.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When you enter your gallery,
it says, "Surrender to love"

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:90%
across the top of the entryway.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Why surrender to love now?

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what the
voices told me to do.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
When I was on ayahuasca
down in Brazil,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I got a few interior design
tips from whatever voices--

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
whatever source you'd
say that that was.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
message they gave me,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
right off the bat,
was surrender to love.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Surrender to love.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
You've got to love yourself
in order to love anyone else,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:90%
and in order to love the world.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
When we surrender to
love, we give up the right

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to righteousness and
to our strong-faced

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%
and "stiff-necked-ness."

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It makes us vulnerable
to the world,

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and able to see things
from another perspective,

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and we open ourselves to
the infinitude of this--

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
what I believe to be--
our ground of being, which

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is that ocean of love
bliss, and our God nature.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I think love is the
secret name of God.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
saying surrender

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to God, which would have
seemed, somehow, too forceful

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and demanding, by saying
surrender to love,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
we all still have a hope
that love is there for us

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in life, whether
it's on a very physical level,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:90%
or a very spiritual level.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole
place was really--

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be there if it
weren't for my wife, Allyson.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:84%
She inspired the
Sacred Mirror series,

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
a number of the works in
there about our relationship--

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
just kissing and
copulating and pregnancy

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and our daughter, and
everything like that.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's a place to renew
one's association with what

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
makes life worth living.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.308 align:middle line:84%
And I think love's
primary in that.

00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Your relationship with
your wife seems really primal

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to what you've learned about
interconnectedness with other

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
human beings, souls,
the planet, et cetera.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Any final comment
regarding that?

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:10%
On an LSD voyage that
we had back in 1976,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:10%
Allyson and I both
melted down into what

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:10%
we came to call the
universal mind lattice,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:10%
and that was a sense of
total interconnectedness

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:10%
with all beings and things
in this web of love energy.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And so for us, that is
the ground of being.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what everyone inherently
is at their essential cores--

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
this, basically, ball of,
fountain, and drain of

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:90%
love energy.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And so trying to present this
sense of interconnectedness

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
on many different
levels and from

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
the many different dimensions
is what our art became about.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:90%
It changed our lives.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And so I would say, just--

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
you got to get to
the core of truth

00:19:53.930 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:84%
by whatever means necessary,
and then live that truth.
