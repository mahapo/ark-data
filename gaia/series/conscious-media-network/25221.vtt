00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:08.714
<v ->Stuart Swerdlow is best known for his involvement</v>

2
00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:10.410
with the Montauk Project,

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.341
a secret program for mind control

4
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:13.919
in which he was a participant,

5
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.842
or more accurately, an experimentee.

6
00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.911
The story of his time there is shocking,

7
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:20.491
but perhaps equally surprising

8
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:23.092
is how Stuart survived the experiments.

9
00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.969
As dark as Montauk was,

10
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.081
somehow Stuart retained access

11
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:28.543
to what he was trained to see

12
00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:31.221
and the esoteric knowledge that he was exposed to,

13
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:33.886
including viewing into other timelines.

14
00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:37.134
This is a story like no other.

15
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.671
Stuart, you have a very interesting background.

16
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:42.921
Even your family has an interesting background.

17
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.747
But first of all, for people who have not become

18
00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.656
familiar with your work prior to now,

19
00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:50.952
let's talk about you, how you get your information,

20
00:00:50.952 --> 00:00:52.253
and have been involved with some

21
00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:53.778
of these incredible projects.

22
00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:55.784
<v ->Well it's a very long story.</v>

23
00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.501
<v Voiceover>But we'll reduce it. (laughs)</v>

24
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.079
<v ->It actually goes back to my birth</v>

25
00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.511
because when my mother was pregnant with me,

26
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:03.026
she didn't know she was pregnant 'til

27
00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:05.020
way into her term.

28
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.761
And then when she went into labor with me,

29
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.297
and she went into a hospital,

30
00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:11.846
they told her it was impossible for her to become pregnant

31
00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:16.000
because her birth canal was blocked and even nonexistent.

32
00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:18.694
So they took her to a wing of the hospital

33
00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.603
that was not finished being built.

34
00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:23.056
There was no heat, there was no finished walls,

35
00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:25.478
and they said there just happened to be a specialist

36
00:01:25.478 --> 00:01:28.220
from Texas who was in the area who

37
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.192
was going to perform surgery on her

38
00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:32.347
in order to pull me out of her womb.

39
00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:33.445
And that's exactly what happened

40
00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:35.418
and it's in medical books 'cause it was the first time

41
00:01:35.418 --> 00:01:39.166
they'd ever seen a woman with no birth canal get pregnant.

42
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.373
I was told many years later that I was actually created

43
00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:46.021
through in vitro fertilization and then implanted

44
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.791
back then which was unheard of at the time.

45
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:49.922
<v Voiceover>Was this known to your mother?</v>

46
00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:51.148
<v ->No.
<v Voiceover>Obviously not.</v>

47
00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:53.369
<v ->It's a very long story with my mother.</v>

48
00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.066
And of course my father who was

49
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:59.545
in the secret military under a mountain in El Paso,

50
00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:02.531
and was followed for many years.

51
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:04.409
But to make a very long story short,

52
00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.542
she should not have become pregnant with me.

53
00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:08.216
I was an anomaly.

54
00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.912
And through my whole life I have had

55
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:12.024
anomalous situations and experiences.

56
00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:14.488
Even as a child I remembered seeing

57
00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:18.040
what I know now to be ghosts or dead people.

58
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.706
I would get information from non-physical sources,

59
00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:22.786
that kind of a thing.

60
00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:25.901
And as I grew up, I became very, very psychic

61
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.618
and was able to communicate.

62
00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:28.610
Of course my parents,

63
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.351
my mother thought there's something wrong with me.

64
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.378
But another interesting thing that happened

65
00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:37.442
is when I was seven or eight years old.

66
00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:39.756
My mother started taking me to a doctor

67
00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:42.754
who lived in this very huge victorian mansion

68
00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:45.015
in a wealthy part of the city.

69
00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:48.353
I would go every single Friday afternoon after school.

70
00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:52.790
And when I would get there, I'd be the only patient.

71
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.107
And there'd be this big, huge room with blocks

72
00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:59.083
and they would say to me, "Go play with the blocks."

73
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:02.816
And every single time I would build a cemetery.

74
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.864
Now did you ever hear of an eight, nine-year old kid

75
00:03:04.864 --> 00:03:06.165
building a cemetery out of blocks?

76
00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:07.193
<v Voiceover>No.</v>

77
00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:09.066
<v ->To me it was normal,</v>

78
00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:10.135
but at the time now I think back,

79
00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:12.225
I'm like that was serious problems there.

80
00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.207
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that was a little creepy. (laughs)</v>

81
00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:14.251
<v ->A little creepy.</v>

82
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:16.693
Then she would take me to a dentist

83
00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:20.288
who would drill my teeth without anesthetics,

84
00:03:20.288 --> 00:03:21.450
who would do all kinds of things.

85
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.678
It was horrible, horrible, horrible trauma.

86
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:26.278
<v ->Something that you'd see in a Nazi movie, okay.</v>

87
00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:30.139
Years and years later after a couple of marriages,

88
00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.198
my current wife said to me,

89
00:03:32.198 --> 00:03:33.691
"You know, you should confront your mother

90
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:34.659
"about all of that."

91
00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.358
<v Voiceover>You think?</v>

92
00:03:35.358 --> 00:03:36.017
<v ->Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:38.364
And so I said to my mother, I said,

94
00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:40.114
"Who was that doctor you took me to

95
00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:41.457
"every Friday afternoon?"

96
00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:42.896
She said, "You're out of your mind.

97
00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:44.007
"I never took you."

98
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:45.724
And I kept pushing and pushing and finally she said,

99
00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:48.027
"Well, it wasn't every Friday."

100
00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.168
Yeah.

101
00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:50.853
Then I found out years later from talking

102
00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:53.200
to other people and comparing notes

103
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.949
to people who'd gone to similar doctors

104
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.850
that this may have been Mengele

105
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.560
and this doctor's name was Dr. Green that I went to,

106
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.154
and I know that was an alias that he used

107
00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:06.144
when he was in the United States.

108
00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:07.924
Then when I had my fillings,

109
00:04:07.924 --> 00:04:10.484
I took all my metal fillings out of my teeth,

110
00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:12.105
the dentist said to me,

111
00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:13.641
"Who did this to you?

112
00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:16.403
"It was completely unnecessary work."

113
00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.418
So I confronted my mother again.

114
00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:21.139
She said, "I never took you to the dentist."

115
00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.741
I said, "I have proof from my dentist now

116
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.522
"that this has been done to me."

117
00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:27.676
She refuses to talk about it.

118
00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:31.228
<v Voiceover>So I guess have you through</v>

119
00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:33.479
your own intuitive investigations been able

120
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.023
to determine your seeding into your mother

121
00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:41.051
and how this, who these factions were?

122
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:42.834
<v ->Well, yes.
<v Voiceover>And in vitro?</v>

123
00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:45.571
<v ->It's a bizarro story, you know.</v>

124
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:50.482
I was used in the Montauk Project from 1970 to 1983,

125
00:04:50.482 --> 00:04:53.882
and I was told that I was chosen because of my genetics,

126
00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:55.686
because of my ancestry,

127
00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.338
because of the capacity of my mind

128
00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.962
to withhold a vast amount of programming

129
00:04:59.962 --> 00:05:02.404
without collapsing or becoming insane.

130
00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:03.984
So I became very,

131
00:05:03.984 --> 00:05:07.413
an important asset for them during those 13 years.

132
00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:10.647
And I learned how to go into hyperspace,

133
00:05:10.647 --> 00:05:12.737
how to read symbols, colors and tones,

134
00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:14.709
how to translate that into a dictionary

135
00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:16.566
which I have in one of my books.

136
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.905
And I was used for all kinds of esoteric

137
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:23.275
experimentations during those years.

138
00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:25.013
<v Voiceover>Do you have recall and knowledge</v>

139
00:05:25.013 --> 00:05:26.250
of most of them?

140
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.149
<v ->And that's the anomaly.</v>

141
00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:29.888
<v Voiceover>Because normally that's erased, isn't it?</v>

142
00:05:29.888 --> 00:05:30.731
<v ->Correct.</v>

143
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.939
And because I remembered in detail

144
00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.207
everything that was done to me,

145
00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:36.745
I became an anomaly, and they did more.

146
00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:39.572
I guess they felt that by testing me to

147
00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.065
to see why I remembered,

148
00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:45.164
they would learn how to block that in future situations.

149
00:05:45.164 --> 00:05:46.945
But it didn't work.

150
00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:48.108
Whatever they did to me,

151
00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:50.379
I still remember everything that happened.

152
00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.319
Unfortunately. I wish I didn't remember.

153
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:55.337
But it was very traumatic.

154
00:05:55.337 --> 00:05:56.829
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about Montauk a little bit?</v>

155
00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:58.153
We really can't do the rest of the story

156
00:05:58.153 --> 00:05:59.315
without that, I suppose.

157
00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:00.082
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

158
00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:03.186
Montauck was an outgrowth of the Cold War.

159
00:06:03.186 --> 00:06:06.024
And again, I have to go back to the Roswell story

160
00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:09.692
and World War II and the Nazis and all of that.

161
00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:12.590
The Illuminati, those who control the planet,

162
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.428
meet to have an element of fear in the public,

163
00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:18.743
because fear opens up the mind

164
00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:20.696
and allows for programming to be input

165
00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:22.669
and then sealed in.

166
00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.505
Of course during the war the Nazis were the threat.

167
00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:29.292
After the war, there was really no threat until the '50s

168
00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:31.074
when the Soviet Union became a threat

169
00:06:31.074 --> 00:06:32.812
to the United States.

170
00:06:32.812 --> 00:06:35.159
And so in the interim period of time,

171
00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.835
they decided to use alien,

172
00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:40.950
that's when UFOs started to appear in 1947

173
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.319
over Seattle, and then Roswell happened.

174
00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.103
And that's because they wanted to,

175
00:06:47.103 --> 00:06:49.640
American public and the world generally,

176
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.076
to think that there was this superior innovator

177
00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:55.764
out there that was threatening

178
00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:57.555
and so the people would become afraid

179
00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:00.434
and then more programming and input can be done.

180
00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:03.175
It was also during that time, late '40s,

181
00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:06.194
when Dr. Ewen Cameron from Scotland

182
00:07:06.194 --> 00:07:09.885
came to Canada and worked with

183
00:07:09.885 --> 00:07:12.328
the Nazi formulas for programming.

184
00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:15.037
He set up clinics in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal,

185
00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:17.266
especially at McGill University and at

186
00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.964
the Allan Institute Memorial,

187
00:07:19.964 --> 00:07:23.037
and he would do psychic driving experimentation

188
00:07:23.037 --> 00:07:24.774
to fracture the mind.

189
00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:27.025
Because they learned when you fracture the mind,

190
00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:28.796
and the personality,

191
00:07:28.796 --> 00:07:32.999
it forms into a geometric cube energetically in the mind,

192
00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.017
13 by 13 by 13.

193
00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:39.909
That is the most splits that you can make into human mind.

194
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:41.349
And if you do the math,

195
00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:45.926
that's 2,197 compartments or alters

196
00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:47.687
that can be programmed through either

197
00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:50.263
full personalities or partial personalities,

198
00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:53.303
constructs, there's a whole science behind it.

199
00:07:53.303 --> 00:07:56.257
So that's what was going on in the United States,

200
00:07:56.257 --> 00:07:59.500
actually in Canada, in the late '40s, early '50s.

201
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.518
It was so successful that they brought

202
00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:04.662
Dr. Ewen Cameron to the United States,

203
00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:06.689
especially the East Coast and the Midwest,

204
00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:10.890
where he set up these facilities in private schools,

205
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.494
hospitals, clinics, this kind of thing.

206
00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:15.488
And then the Monarch Program began

207
00:08:15.488 --> 00:08:16.874
in the United States.

208
00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:18.432
Mostly with women.

209
00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:21.364
But 15% were also males.

210
00:08:21.364 --> 00:08:25.644
And of course my birth in the year 1956

211
00:08:26.484 --> 00:08:28.586
was the year when they were experimenting

212
00:08:28.586 --> 00:08:32.532
genetically with mixing certain DNA

213
00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:35.648
in order to produce an offspring

214
00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:39.678
that could be deeply programmed into mind control.

215
00:08:39.678 --> 00:08:41.556
And that's where I came in.

216
00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:44.532
And I imagine that they must've formulated something

217
00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:47.592
and implanted into my mother.

218
00:08:47.592 --> 00:08:50.728
And I also think it is because of my ancestry

219
00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:53.161
with my father's side of the family

220
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:56.233
who was from the Soviet Union.

221
00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:58.014
<v Voiceover>And this is an appropriate time</v>

222
00:08:58.014 --> 00:08:59.038
to bring that up.

223
00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.991
<v ->Yeah, and so my family, my great uncle</v>

224
00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:04.444
Yakov Sverdlov was the first president

225
00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.333
of the Soviet Union.

226
00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:08.999
Prior to that he was roommates with Stalin

227
00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:12.413
in the Gulag before they eliminated

228
00:09:12.413 --> 00:09:14.182
the royal family, the Romanovs.

229
00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:16.807
It was my uncle who actually ordered

230
00:09:16.807 --> 00:09:19.515
the assassination of the Tsar and Tsarina,

231
00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:22.098
and the children in the city of Yekaterinburg

232
00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:23.932
in the Ural Mountains.

233
00:09:23.932 --> 00:09:27.089
And in honor of the execution that he ordered,

234
00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:30.758
they renamed the city of Yekaterinburg "Sverdlovsk"

235
00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:34.686
which means means the city, in English, of Sverdlov.

236
00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:38.768
But my name Swerdlow is actually not Russian at all,

237
00:09:38.768 --> 00:09:42.182
but of Swedish derivation and it means

238
00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:44.432
a sword in the leaf's spirit and love,

239
00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:46.960
which came from a Viking clan

240
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.583
in the western part of Sweden who created

241
00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:52.164
a group called the Rus, or the Rose,

242
00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:56.389
who in the 900s invaded Russia and Ukraine

243
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:59.844
and that's where Russia got its name.

244
00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:03.088
<v Voiceover>So you have the strength of that bloodline,</v>

245
00:10:03.088 --> 00:10:05.061
which obviously there's a good amount of

246
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:06.832
tensile strength genetically.

247
00:10:06.832 --> 00:10:07.642
<v ->Yes.</v>

248
00:10:07.642 --> 00:10:09.851
<v Voiceover>And also passed down through</v>

249
00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:11.728
informations systems, generation to generation.

250
00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:12.559
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

251
00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:14.448
<v Voiceover>And then you have your mother,</v>

252
00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:16.837
and did your mother realize

253
00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:19.066
what she was doing to you?

254
00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:20.303
What was being done to you?

255
00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:22.554
How did she end up taking you to these places?

256
00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:24.505
Who was controlling your mother?

257
00:10:24.505 --> 00:10:26.139
<v ->That is a very good question,</v>

258
00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:29.143
and I've never been able to get a decent answer from her.

259
00:10:29.143 --> 00:10:32.132
I've confronted her a couple of times over the years.

260
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.444
I was much older when I confronted her.

261
00:10:34.444 --> 00:10:35.905
She finally admitted that she did

262
00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:38.376
take me to a doctor every Friday afternoon

263
00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.032
who experimented on me and tested me.

264
00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:41.189
<v Voiceover>And that was as much as</v>

265
00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:41.891
you're gonna get out of her, huh?

266
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.383
<v ->And that's as much as I'm gonna get out,</v>

267
00:10:43.383 --> 00:10:45.101
but I do believe it had to do more with

268
00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:48.994
my father's ancestry and his genetic line

269
00:10:48.994 --> 00:10:52.343
because his father, the brother of Yakov

270
00:10:52.343 --> 00:10:56.780
was sent first to Great Britain in the early 1920s

271
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.446
in order to start the Communist Party in Britain.

272
00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:01.911
And the idea was to start to incorporate

273
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.630
the rest of Europe into the Soviet sphere.

274
00:11:06.342 --> 00:11:10.496
And he set up a Communist group there in Liverpool,

275
00:11:10.496 --> 00:11:13.931
and the immigration records show

276
00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:16.277
that my grandfather actually emigrated

277
00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:19.201
to the U.S. from Liverpool, not from Russia.

278
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:21.983
Although he has Russian documentation.

279
00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:23.754
So he came to the United States

280
00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:25.770
to form the Communist party

281
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.674
and to entice the workers of the North America,

282
00:11:29.674 --> 00:11:31.850
to go back to the worker's paradise.

283
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.780
And he did that.

284
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.828
And he was an operative here for many, many years

285
00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:39.814
and he died 1986 in Los Angeles.

286
00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Voiceover>Okay, thank you for that</v>

287
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.286
incredible background.

288
00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:45.352
<v ->That's a synopsis.</v>

289
00:11:45.352 --> 00:11:46.631
<v Voiceover>That's a synopsis of it.</v>

290
00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:48.092
Which book can we find that in?

291
00:11:48.092 --> 00:11:49.768
Do you share your full story?

292
00:11:49.768 --> 00:11:51.698
<v ->Much of it.</v>

293
00:11:51.698 --> 00:11:55.399
And that would be in Montauk Alien Connection

294
00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:57.277
and also Blue Blood True Blood.

295
00:11:57.277 --> 00:11:58.737
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

296
00:11:58.737 --> 00:12:02.013
<v Voiceover>Let's go to what you're here presenting</v>

297
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.985
at the Conspiracy Con.

298
00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:06.331
And you're here looking at some of the history

299
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:07.377
of the planet Earth.

300
00:12:07.377 --> 00:12:10.673
And you're looking at very large, deep types of history.

301
00:12:10.673 --> 00:12:13.372
We're looking at seeding of the Earth's population,

302
00:12:13.372 --> 00:12:15.760
all the way through to through events that you see

303
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.642
coming up in our near and not quite so near future.

304
00:12:19.642 --> 00:12:22.490
So why don't we first begin with,

305
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.370
and again we'll have to hopscotch

306
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.346
through it for time's sake,

307
00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:30.837
a look at how you see and have seen

308
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:32.372
the seeding of the Earth.

309
00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:33.973
And first, how did this come to you?

310
00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:36.202
And tell us then what you have understood

311
00:12:36.202 --> 00:12:37.780
about the seeding of this planet

312
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.850
and the sources of beings.

313
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.074
<v ->When I had my years at Montauk, I spent 13 years there,</v>

314
00:12:44.074 --> 00:12:47.627
we were indoctrinated very often,

315
00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:49.287
those of us who survived.

316
00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:51.349
And I might say that I was told

317
00:12:51.349 --> 00:12:55.381
that less than 1% survived the processes at Montauk.

318
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:57.823
And the ones who did survive

319
00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:00.074
are not able to function in public

320
00:13:00.074 --> 00:13:02.441
because they were distorted in their minds.

321
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:04.351
And I was one of the very, very few

322
00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.088
who is able to function,

323
00:13:06.088 --> 00:13:08.595
even though on my opinion maybe not so well.

324
00:13:08.595 --> 00:13:11.102
But because of what we did,

325
00:13:11.102 --> 00:13:14.398
we were encouraged to do the work

326
00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:17.651
because we were told point blank that humanity

327
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:21.479
was incapable of handling its own affairs,

328
00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:23.614
and if left to its own devices,

329
00:13:23.614 --> 00:13:25.704
they would destroy each other.

330
00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:28.562
And so the purpose of Montauk Project

331
00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:32.188
was to create massive global mind control

332
00:13:32.188 --> 00:13:34.534
and programming so that people would

333
00:13:34.534 --> 00:13:37.266
perform their functions properly without questioning,

334
00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:39.803
and that the society would continue unimpeded

335
00:13:39.803 --> 00:13:41.958
and be able to grow and prosper.

336
00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.985
So it was presented in a way

337
00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:46.790
that was a positive for the Earth.

338
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.137
In addition, they told us the history,

339
00:13:49.137 --> 00:13:51.878
because most of the technology that was used

340
00:13:51.878 --> 00:13:53.264
was not from here.

341
00:13:53.264 --> 00:13:56.357
A lot of it came from a star system called Sirius A,

342
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:58.096
which has very high technology

343
00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:00.538
and in my opinion was in control

344
00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:04.493
of some aspects of the U.S. government at the time.

345
00:14:04.493 --> 00:14:07.331
And there was something called the Montauk chair,

346
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:08.654
which kind of looked like a dental chair

347
00:14:08.654 --> 00:14:11.180
with these wings on the sides that would go

348
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.304
into the temples of the head.

349
00:14:13.304 --> 00:14:14.808
I was not on that chair,

350
00:14:14.808 --> 00:14:18.082
but I was used as a booster for the person

351
00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:20.312
who was used on the chair.

352
00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:24.471
They would then take people.

353
00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:26.391
And they started out with derelicts.

354
00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:28.204
They started out with people who

355
00:14:28.204 --> 00:14:30.177
were considered disposable.

356
00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:31.297
<v Voiceover>Right. Broken.</v>

357
00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:33.814
<v ->Derelicts, children of alcoholics.</v>

358
00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:36.063
Foster kids, orphans.

359
00:14:36.063 --> 00:14:37.600
People that if they disappeared,

360
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.691
nobody was gonna look for them.

361
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:43.296
And then when that became

362
00:14:43.296 --> 00:14:45.491
not so convenient anymore,

363
00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:48.168
they started to use the children of military people

364
00:14:48.168 --> 00:14:50.674
and other, and my father was in the military.

365
00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:54.872
And so I was used in those experiments.

366
00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:57.579
And I did very well in the experiments,

367
00:14:57.579 --> 00:14:59.340
whether it was because of my mind pattern,

368
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.217
my genetics, what have you.

369
00:15:01.217 --> 00:15:05.514
All of the above, I excelled in what they did to me.

370
00:15:05.514 --> 00:15:07.349
<v Voiceover>And what would be the nature</v>

371
00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:09.024
of this, for example?

372
00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:09.878
<v ->What they did?</v>

373
00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:10.576
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

374
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.064
<v ->To fracture. Horrible, horrible things.</v>

375
00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:15.314
There would be physical torture.

376
00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:19.219
Sexual ritual magic, including rape.

377
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:21.447
Beatings.

378
00:15:21.447 --> 00:15:24.051
What they call psychic driving,

379
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:26.836
where they would put a device

380
00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:30.184
that split the face, your optic visual acuity

381
00:15:30.184 --> 00:15:31.901
would be split in half.

382
00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:33.438
This side they would show you pictures

383
00:15:33.438 --> 00:15:35.752
of flowers growing and lovely pictures,

384
00:15:35.752 --> 00:15:37.011
and here they would show you

385
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:38.333
children being ripped apart,

386
00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:39.751
shredded, people murdered.

387
00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:42.632
All inputted at the same time.

388
00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:45.468
One side the ear they would put classical music,

389
00:15:45.468 --> 00:15:47.485
here they'd put acid rock.

390
00:15:47.485 --> 00:15:49.500
And they would do things like this.

391
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.217
Then they would starve you.

392
00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:52.871
Then they would overfeed you.

393
00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:55.175
Then they'd put you to sleep for long periods of time.

394
00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:57.585
Then they'd keep you awake for long periods of time.

395
00:15:57.585 --> 00:15:59.931
So it got to the point where you did not know

396
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.276
what to expect.

397
00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:02.372
There was no consistency.

398
00:16:02.372 --> 00:16:03.468
<v Voiceover>There was no identity.</v>

399
00:16:03.468 --> 00:16:04.452
No self identity anymore.

400
00:16:04.452 --> 00:16:05.594
<v ->No, no self identity.</v>

401
00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:06.724
Only what they gave you.

402
00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:07.336
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

403
00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:09.443
<v ->And that fractured the person enough,</v>

404
00:16:09.443 --> 00:16:13.125
and thanks to the experiments in Canada

405
00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:15.118
and by the Nazis as well,

406
00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:16.399
because they did bring

407
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.700
Nazi scientists over in Project Paperclip.

408
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.278
<v Voiceover>Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.</v>

409
00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:22.894
<v ->And so Montauk was about first,</v>

410
00:16:22.894 --> 00:16:24.868
this mind control experiment.

411
00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:28.824
Then they also did time travel using alien technology.

412
00:16:28.824 --> 00:16:30.979
They also did esoteric weaponry,

413
00:16:30.979 --> 00:16:32.653
which is I see now available today

414
00:16:32.653 --> 00:16:35.758
in this century that's there.

415
00:16:35.758 --> 00:16:39.662
They also created interesting things.

416
00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:42.755
For example, then this was actually before Montauk,

417
00:16:42.755 --> 00:16:44.397
and this may not sit well with some

418
00:16:44.397 --> 00:16:46.371
of the listeners or viewers,

419
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:50.765
but the New Age was actually started in 1965

420
00:16:50.765 --> 00:16:54.061
by the U.S. government in order to lay the groundwork

421
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:57.933
for the New World religion and for end times programming,

422
00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.511
which is what we're experiencing right now.

423
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:00.727
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

424
00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:04.023
<v ->So that was just in a nutshell what Montauk was about.</v>

425
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.827
The reason they felt compelled to do this

426
00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:09.196
is because when you are a very relatively

427
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.681
small group of people out of a planet

428
00:17:11.681 --> 00:17:13.473
of billions of people,

429
00:17:13.473 --> 00:17:18.017
and you're perhaps a couple hundred thousand controlling it,

430
00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:20.507
armies and weapons aren't enough.

431
00:17:20.507 --> 00:17:22.971
You can be overwhelmed by the masses of people.

432
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:24.871
But if you mind control the people,

433
00:17:24.871 --> 00:17:26.566
so that they don't pay attention,

434
00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:29.777
they have blinders on and you create issues

435
00:17:29.777 --> 00:17:31.697
where problems develop,

436
00:17:31.697 --> 00:17:33.926
that the people then demand a solution,

437
00:17:33.926 --> 00:17:38.182
you then impose the solution that you wanted to use anyway.

438
00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:41.286
So in effect you have the population demand

439
00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:43.685
the solution that you want to impose.

440
00:17:43.685 --> 00:17:45.883
And it's quite brilliant, actually,

441
00:17:45.883 --> 00:17:47.163
the techniques that they use.

442
00:17:47.163 --> 00:17:48.420
<v Voiceover>It is efficient because it doesn't</v>

443
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.722
have to be forced on anyone.

444
00:17:49.722 --> 00:17:50.416
<v ->Correct.</v>

445
00:17:50.416 --> 00:17:52.068
<v Voiceover>We actually request it or demand it.</v>

446
00:17:52.068 --> 00:17:53.413
<v ->Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

447
00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:54.681
<v Voiceover>And we can see evidence of that</v>

448
00:17:54.681 --> 00:17:57.220
around us everywhere.

449
00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.030
<v ->Correct.</v>

450
00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.257
<v Voiceover>The media.</v>

451
00:17:59.257 --> 00:18:00.218
<v ->Especially in that.</v>

452
00:18:00.218 --> 00:18:01.532
<v Voiceover>Probably particularly the media now.</v>

453
00:18:01.532 --> 00:18:02.283
<v ->Yes.</v>

454
00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:04.868
<v Voiceover>Okay, so now after you're broken,</v>

455
00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:08.654
and for you they'd already identified

456
00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.177
this psychic ability, this deep psychic ability.

457
00:18:11.177 --> 00:18:11.767
<v ->Yes.</v>

458
00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:13.630
<v Voiceover>Actually maybe you were genetically</v>

459
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.398
engineered because of these features.

460
00:18:15.398 --> 00:18:18.587
So you have a broken individual that's compartmentalized

461
00:18:18.587 --> 00:18:20.699
and has the ability to see.

462
00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.831
And how did they use your mind in terms

463
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:25.573
of time travel, hyper spacial awareness, and so forth?

464
00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:29.284
<v ->What they did, because of the ELF and microwave</v>

465
00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:32.932
protocols that they used on me,

466
00:18:32.932 --> 00:18:35.833
I became physically blind.

467
00:18:35.833 --> 00:18:39.876
I was blind really for 29 years.

468
00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:43.213
But they did this for a purpose.

469
00:18:43.213 --> 00:18:46.349
The purpose was to remove physical senses

470
00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:48.397
so that the other portions of the brain,

471
00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:51.064
the 90% that isn't used by most people,

472
00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:54.434
then develops the capacity to see in other ways.

473
00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.268
And so I could look at a person

474
00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.615
even though my eyes wouldn't register.

475
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:00.909
I would see energy fields,

476
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:04.045
the archetypes that emanate from the body, the DNA,

477
00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:06.178
I'd see your simultaneous existences

478
00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:10.178
because you exist in infinite reality simultaneously,

479
00:19:10.178 --> 00:19:12.983
but if I know your birth name and your birth date

480
00:19:12.983 --> 00:19:15.467
I focus in who you think you are at the moment

481
00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:18.251
and I can read everything about you.

482
00:19:18.251 --> 00:19:20.686
And you can also then go into what is called

483
00:19:20.686 --> 00:19:22.467
a hyperspace level.

484
00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:24.439
This is not the astral.

485
00:19:24.439 --> 00:19:27.703
Physical reality's like the yolk of an egg.

486
00:19:27.703 --> 00:19:30.444
The astral is like the--

487
00:19:30.444 --> 00:19:31.489
<v Voiceover>The white?</v>

488
00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:32.886
<v ->The white part, yes.</v>

489
00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:34.625
And the shell is like the hyperspace

490
00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:36.855
that connects or holds it all together.

491
00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:39.360
And so when you go into hyperspace

492
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.040
it's the basic foundation of the energy of the God-mind.

493
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.985
It's archetype, color and tone.

494
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.523
And those three, it's a triad communication.

495
00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:51.679
And if you understand the meanings of the colors,

496
00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:53.951
and the meanings of the symbols,

497
00:19:53.951 --> 00:19:57.012
and you string them together in certain formulations,

498
00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:00.682
you can manifest whatever it is you want to create.

499
00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:03.956
So one of the major works that I did at Montauk

500
00:20:03.956 --> 00:20:05.982
was to go into this hyperspace level,

501
00:20:05.982 --> 00:20:09.022
since I was in it anyway, and decipher.

502
00:20:09.022 --> 00:20:11.807
This symbol means this, this color refines it to this,

503
00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:13.459
and so on and so on.

504
00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:15.359
And in fact in my book A Healer's Handbook,

505
00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:18.900
I have the most comprehensive dictionary

506
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.792
of archetype symbols that I know of

507
00:20:21.792 --> 00:20:22.568
for public.

508
00:20:22.568 --> 00:20:24.712
I'm sure the Illuminati have much more than that.

509
00:20:24.712 --> 00:20:27.753
But I have that in a dictionary for people to use.

510
00:20:27.753 --> 00:20:30.771
So that's basically one of the things I did.

511
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.446
<v Voiceover>So when you would go out,</v>

512
00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:34.206
and you'd start bringing back

513
00:20:34.206 --> 00:20:36.434
and decoding the information,

514
00:20:36.434 --> 00:20:38.130
were they using you for essentially

515
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.710
looking into the future?

516
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.075
Is that part of what you did?

517
00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:42.376
<v ->Future and past.</v>

518
00:20:42.376 --> 00:20:43.699
<v Voiceover>Future and past, okay.</v>

519
00:20:43.699 --> 00:20:45.907
<v ->They were particularly interested in the past,</v>

520
00:20:45.907 --> 00:20:49.700
and especially for the time of Christ.

521
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.567
And I wrote about it in my book Montauk Alien Connection,

522
00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:55.796
which is my autobiography.

523
00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:58.537
They had me actually go back,

524
00:20:58.537 --> 00:21:01.278
time travel to the time of Christ.

525
00:21:01.278 --> 00:21:04.688
And of course what we know about

526
00:21:04.688 --> 00:21:06.983
history is not true.

527
00:21:06.983 --> 00:21:09.960
What is taught in school, religion, what have you,

528
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.889
mostly false.

529
00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:16.231
Rewritten in order to enhance the programming.

530
00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:19.741
The history is then rewritten to undermine

531
00:21:19.741 --> 00:21:22.962
and support the new programming.

532
00:21:22.962 --> 00:21:24.636
So most of history is fake.

533
00:21:24.636 --> 00:21:25.607
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

534
00:21:25.607 --> 00:21:28.231
And to also set agendas into motion.

535
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:29.297
<v ->Correct.</v>

536
00:21:29.297 --> 00:21:30.297
<v Voiceover>For the teachers such as Revelations,</v>

537
00:21:30.297 --> 00:21:32.343
armageddon and all that.

538
00:21:32.343 --> 00:21:33.223
<v Voiceover>Very highly programmed.</v>

539
00:21:33.223 --> 00:21:34.641
What did you see around the time of Christ?

540
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:38.727
<v ->Well, I saw that he was a genetic manipulation, as well.</v>

541
00:21:38.727 --> 00:21:41.446
He was a creation of an alien group

542
00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:45.831
that was here to alter the direction of humanity.

543
00:21:45.831 --> 00:21:48.697
Not for good purposes, but for their own.

544
00:21:48.697 --> 00:21:50.735
And that's something that people should know.

545
00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:53.689
There's no such thing as good aliens

546
00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:56.676
coming to save the Earth or space brothers.

547
00:21:56.676 --> 00:21:59.673
That's a New Age manufacture.

548
00:21:59.673 --> 00:22:02.394
If someone's here to interfere,

549
00:22:02.394 --> 00:22:03.619
they have their own agenda.

550
00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:04.835
<v Voiceover>If they're interfering.</v>

551
00:22:04.835 --> 00:22:05.547
<v ->Yeah.</v>

552
00:22:05.547 --> 00:22:07.335
The ones who are benevolent, they don't interfere.

553
00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:08.640
<v Voiceover>They don't interfere.</v>

554
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.889
<v ->They just watch.</v>

555
00:22:09.889 --> 00:22:11.766
<v Voiceover>Yes, and there's a lot of debate about</v>

556
00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:14.465
this period of time where they watch

557
00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:17.410
and help is trying to be given

558
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.427
on very subtle levels without interfering.

559
00:22:20.427 --> 00:22:22.379
And I think there's a fine line there

560
00:22:22.379 --> 00:22:25.536
for any beings that may be trying to assist

561
00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:28.022
during this time of challenging period of human history.

562
00:22:28.022 --> 00:22:29.089
<v ->Yes, yes, absolutely.</v>

563
00:22:29.089 --> 00:22:30.433
<v Voiceover>Because those with no ethics,</v>

564
00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:31.479
that are here to interfere.

565
00:22:31.479 --> 00:22:33.272
There are no, that's the point, there are no ethics.

566
00:22:33.272 --> 00:22:34.711
<v ->Right. Well they have their own agenda.</v>

567
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:35.853
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

568
00:22:35.853 --> 00:22:37.686
<v ->What we learned is,</v>

569
00:22:37.686 --> 00:22:40.770
human beings are not native really to this planet.

570
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.187
We are aliens here.

571
00:22:42.187 --> 00:22:44.716
And the proof of it is when you look in nature

572
00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:46.827
and you see insects, animals, what have you,

573
00:22:46.827 --> 00:22:48.662
they wake up in the morning

574
00:22:48.662 --> 00:22:50.731
and they can find food, they have shelter,

575
00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:52.406
they have everything they need right there.

576
00:22:52.406 --> 00:22:53.377
Humans do not.

577
00:22:53.377 --> 00:22:54.774
You have to get clothes, you have to find food,

578
00:22:54.774 --> 00:22:56.554
everything is a struggle to survive.

579
00:22:56.554 --> 00:22:59.786
If you're native to an environment that created you,

580
00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:01.622
the environment supplies you that way.

581
00:23:01.622 --> 00:23:02.289
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

582
00:23:02.289 --> 00:23:03.231
<v ->Human beings are not like this.</v>

583
00:23:03.231 --> 00:23:04.247
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Very true.</v>

584
00:23:04.247 --> 00:23:06.583
<v ->We are aliens to this world, see.</v>

585
00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:10.327
<v ->And the history that I learned at Montauk</v>

586
00:23:10.327 --> 00:23:14.135
showed that this planet was once totally covered

587
00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:17.197
in water, even the atmosphere.

588
00:23:17.197 --> 00:23:20.311
And it was the second position from the sun.

589
00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:22.977
There was Mercury, Earth, Mars,

590
00:23:22.977 --> 00:23:25.323
then a planet called Maldek,

591
00:23:25.323 --> 00:23:27.553
and then Jupiter, Saturn, and so on.

592
00:23:27.553 --> 00:23:29.846
And I have to go further back in history.

593
00:23:29.846 --> 00:23:34.080
All human beings came from a star system called Lyra.

594
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.704
And Lyra was attacked eons ago

595
00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:39.019
by reptilians from the Draco star system

596
00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:41.365
that eliminated that civilization

597
00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:44.158
and the Lyrian refugees, those who survived,

598
00:23:44.158 --> 00:23:47.016
spread out through the known galaxy then

599
00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:49.992
to colonize different worlds and different star systems.

600
00:23:49.992 --> 00:23:53.490
And in our solar system at that time,

601
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.306
Mars and Maldek were the only two worlds

602
00:23:56.306 --> 00:23:59.463
that had atmospheres and oceans that could be colonized.

603
00:23:59.463 --> 00:24:02.408
The Draco would look for the survivors

604
00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:04.157
and try to destroy them.

605
00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:07.890
They use comets and asteroids as vehicles

606
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.095
as well as weapons.

607
00:24:09.095 --> 00:24:10.279
They create small, little black holes

608
00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:13.066
in front of these huge objects and they pull them

609
00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:14.410
in the direction.

610
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.814
And so when they discovered the colonies

611
00:24:15.814 --> 00:24:16.832
in this solar system,

612
00:24:16.832 --> 00:24:19.594
they sent an ice comet into our solar system

613
00:24:19.594 --> 00:24:21.632
to destroy those colonies.

614
00:24:21.632 --> 00:24:25.258
As the ice comet came past the planet Uranus,

615
00:24:25.258 --> 00:24:27.701
it flipped Uranus on its axis.

616
00:24:27.701 --> 00:24:30.325
Uranus is the only planet that goes north to south

617
00:24:30.325 --> 00:24:32.523
in rotation instead of east to west.

618
00:24:32.523 --> 00:24:33.844
It's the only known one,

619
00:24:33.844 --> 00:24:36.170
because of the effects of the comet.

620
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.908
As the comet came closer

621
00:24:37.908 --> 00:24:41.301
between Jupiter and Maldek and Mars,

622
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:45.674
the magnetic pull of all these planets close together,

623
00:24:45.674 --> 00:24:48.714
plus the incoming energy of the ice comet,

624
00:24:48.714 --> 00:24:51.592
caused Maldek to explode,

625
00:24:51.592 --> 00:24:54.473
which is why we now have an asteroid belt

626
00:24:54.473 --> 00:24:56.724
between Mars and Jupiter.

627
00:24:56.724 --> 00:24:58.323
And as it got closer to Mars,

628
00:24:58.323 --> 00:25:01.459
it pulled the atmosphere and a lot of the oceans

629
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:04.477
off of Mars, which is why it looks it does today.

630
00:25:04.477 --> 00:25:06.910
And then it continued towards the Earth.

631
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.606
As it came towards the Earth,

632
00:25:08.606 --> 00:25:11.539
the trajectory started to slow down,

633
00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:13.736
the black hole started to disintegrate,

634
00:25:13.736 --> 00:25:15.783
and the Earth and the ice comet started

635
00:25:15.783 --> 00:25:18.247
to rotate around each other,

636
00:25:18.247 --> 00:25:20.658
polarizing the oceans,

637
00:25:20.658 --> 00:25:24.562
and the spin created the ice caps on the planet.

638
00:25:24.562 --> 00:25:28.946
And then the Earth and the ice comet switched positions,

639
00:25:28.946 --> 00:25:32.673
pushing the Earth out to the third position from the sun.

640
00:25:32.673 --> 00:25:36.277
The ice comet took up the second position from the sun,

641
00:25:36.277 --> 00:25:40.172
and the ice then started to melt and evaporate,

642
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:44.623
creating a cloud cover, and we know this now as Venus.

643
00:25:44.883 --> 00:25:48.154
And back in the late 1980s,

644
00:25:48.154 --> 00:25:50.318
just before the collapse of the Soviet Union,

645
00:25:50.318 --> 00:25:55.246
they sent a vehicle into the Venusian atmosphere

646
00:25:55.246 --> 00:25:59.129
with cameras that were able to survive the heat.

647
00:25:59.129 --> 00:26:01.539
And before it was destroyed,

648
00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:03.844
the camera sent back to Russia

649
00:26:03.844 --> 00:26:08.110
pictures of seven domed areas on the surface of Venus.

650
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.454
<v Voiceover>Artificially constructed domes.</v>

651
00:26:09.454 --> 00:26:13.826
<v ->Well, on the front page LA Times and New York Times</v>

652
00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:16.380
was a full-page articles on what

653
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.324
the Soviet spacecraft had uncovered.

654
00:26:19.324 --> 00:26:21.810
Seven perfectly shaped domes.

655
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.783
And of course at the very end of the article it said,

656
00:26:23.783 --> 00:26:27.334
scientists have determined it is a natural formation.

657
00:26:27.334 --> 00:26:29.479
<v Voiceover>(laughs loudly) Okay.</v>

658
00:26:29.479 --> 00:26:31.728
<v ->But if you know about reptilian culture,</v>

659
00:26:31.728 --> 00:26:33.169
the Draco culture,

660
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:36.450
they're seven species that comprise

661
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.150
the empire of the Draco

662
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.118
and each is in a hierarchy.

663
00:26:41.118 --> 00:26:43.027
They have their own special functions.

664
00:26:43.027 --> 00:26:44.767
They do not mix.

665
00:26:44.767 --> 00:26:46.717
It's very separated.

666
00:26:46.717 --> 00:26:48.755
And so it would make sense then

667
00:26:48.755 --> 00:26:51.433
that they would have seven different domed areas

668
00:26:51.433 --> 00:26:52.734
or living quarters.

669
00:26:52.734 --> 00:26:53.662
They would not mix.

670
00:26:53.662 --> 00:26:55.422
They would each be kept separately.

671
00:26:55.422 --> 00:26:59.742
I also know that this Draco hierarchy

672
00:26:59.742 --> 00:27:02.131
became the basis of the Hindu religion

673
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:06.216
of the different caste systems of the Hindu religion.

674
00:27:06.216 --> 00:27:08.620
From Brahmin down to untouchable.

675
00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.345
It's duplicates basically of that.

676
00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:15.382
So again, I'm making millions of years of history

677
00:27:15.382 --> 00:27:16.662
into a few moments.

678
00:27:16.662 --> 00:27:18.005
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I appreciate it.</v>

679
00:27:18.005 --> 00:27:19.073
<v ->'Cause we'd be here for weeks.</v>

680
00:27:19.073 --> 00:27:20.309
<v Voiceover>Yes, we would.</v>

681
00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:22.486
<v ->And so then what happened is</v>

682
00:27:22.486 --> 00:27:26.155
since now land masses rose on the Earth

683
00:27:26.155 --> 00:27:28.827
'cause the water was polarized, now land masses appeared,

684
00:27:28.827 --> 00:27:31.216
the Draco drove into our solar system

685
00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:34.001
another vehicle that they used to colonize

686
00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:35.953
one of those large continents.

687
00:27:35.953 --> 00:27:38.512
And they drove in on what we now know is the moon.

688
00:27:38.512 --> 00:27:40.368
And you know the moon is again,

689
00:27:40.368 --> 00:27:44.431
the only object known in space that does not rotate.

690
00:27:44.874 --> 00:27:46.986
It just faces one side all the time.

691
00:27:46.986 --> 00:27:47.637
<v Voiceover>Odd.</v>

692
00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:49.874
<v ->It's a vehicle parked in space.</v>

693
00:27:49.874 --> 00:27:51.885
<v ->And if you were to send a sonic resonance</v>

694
00:27:51.885 --> 00:27:53.229
off the surface of the moon,

695
00:27:53.229 --> 00:27:57.101
it pings, demonstrating that the moon is hollow.

696
00:27:57.101 --> 00:27:59.618
If it was solid, it would thump.

697
00:27:59.618 --> 00:28:01.730
The moon doesn't thump. It pings.

698
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.723
And a few years ago when I was doing

699
00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.824
work in Switzerland,

700
00:28:05.824 --> 00:28:08.215
there was a Swiss scientific magazine.

701
00:28:08.215 --> 00:28:09.974
This was back in the '90s.

702
00:28:09.974 --> 00:28:12.652
That stated the moon should be reclassified

703
00:28:12.652 --> 00:28:14.177
because it's hollow.

704
00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:15.893
It's not what people think it is.

705
00:28:15.893 --> 00:28:17.802
And then a couple of years after that,

706
00:28:17.802 --> 00:28:20.523
there was an article from NASA

707
00:28:20.523 --> 00:28:22.454
which was quickly obliterated,

708
00:28:22.454 --> 00:28:26.868
that stated that the rocks on the moon

709
00:28:27.548 --> 00:28:29.672
showed that it was not from our solar system.

710
00:28:29.672 --> 00:28:33.426
It doesn't match any other minerals from this region.

711
00:28:33.426 --> 00:28:34.855
<v Voiceover>And that was obscured?</v>

712
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:36.508
That information was quickly obscured.

713
00:28:36.508 --> 00:28:37.978
<v ->Removed.</v>

714
00:28:37.978 --> 00:28:39.850
<v Voiceover>Proof enough just in that alone.</v>

715
00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.012
<v ->Yeah.</v>

716
00:28:41.012 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Voiceover>So let's go to Lyra.</v>

717
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.865
<v ->I'd love to, but this doesn't exist anymore. (laughs)</v>

718
00:28:45.865 --> 00:28:47.534
<v Voiceover>You know what I mean.</v>

719
00:28:47.534 --> 00:28:48.877
<v Voiceover>From that influence and then</v>

720
00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:50.182
let's get it down to the human level.

721
00:28:50.182 --> 00:28:50.975
<v ->Oh, yeah, Okay.</v>

722
00:28:50.975 --> 00:28:51.936
<v Voiceover>That influence.</v>

723
00:28:51.936 --> 00:28:55.722
<v ->So then we had this colonization of</v>

724
00:28:55.722 --> 00:28:57.674
reptilians on the Earth,

725
00:28:57.674 --> 00:29:01.045
which they colonized the largest continent

726
00:29:01.045 --> 00:29:05.290
through history was known as Mu or Lemuria,

727
00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.178
depending on the culture.

728
00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:11.065
It existed in what is now the Pacific Ocean.

729
00:29:12.505 --> 00:29:16.021
Many millenia later it was decided

730
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:18.249
that some of the refugees from Lyra

731
00:29:18.249 --> 00:29:20.318
would then colonize the Earth, as well.

732
00:29:20.318 --> 00:29:23.967
And they colonized what we now know as Atlantis.

733
00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:26.632
It was a continent in the Atlantic ocean.

734
00:29:26.632 --> 00:29:29.512
When you have reptilians and mammalians

735
00:29:29.512 --> 00:29:32.648
living in the same environment, doesn't go together.

736
00:29:32.648 --> 00:29:33.907
There's conflict and struggle.

737
00:29:33.907 --> 00:29:34.995
They don't belong together.

738
00:29:34.995 --> 00:29:36.553
Plus, they were natural enemies.

739
00:29:36.553 --> 00:29:39.870
And so there were wars between Lemuria and Atlantis.

740
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.331
<v Voiceover>And this is also documented well</v>

741
00:29:41.331 --> 00:29:43.144
in a lot of Dolores Cannon's work.

742
00:29:43.144 --> 00:29:44.765
<v ->Yes. I know Dolores very well.</v>

743
00:29:44.765 --> 00:29:46.792
<v Voiceover>Yes, and other people.</v>

744
00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:49.224
Individuals that I know who have been back,

745
00:29:49.224 --> 00:29:50.877
been able to traverse back in time,

746
00:29:50.877 --> 00:29:52.712
and they talk about the fact that there were

747
00:29:52.712 --> 00:29:54.524
these war-like ships when they were living

748
00:29:54.524 --> 00:29:56.733
in Atlantian times they had to hide from.

749
00:29:56.733 --> 00:30:00.009
<v ->Yes, and it's also documented in</v>

750
00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:02.132
the Indian Vedas.

751
00:30:02.132 --> 00:30:03.125
<v Voiceover>Vedas, yes.</v>

752
00:30:03.125 --> 00:30:04.651
<v ->Which talk about the vimanas,</v>

753
00:30:04.651 --> 00:30:06.276
which are these vehicles,

754
00:30:06.276 --> 00:30:08.942
and there's actually diagrams,

755
00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:11.545
technological diagrams on how to build them

756
00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:14.680
which are 50,000 years old,

757
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.418
and were copied from older documents.

758
00:30:16.418 --> 00:30:17.346
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

759
00:30:17.346 --> 00:30:19.320
<v ->And also spoke about the fiery lances</v>

760
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.461
that would fly through the airs

761
00:30:20.461 --> 00:30:22.391
and create mushroom clouds,

762
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:24.312
so they're talking about nuclear weapons

763
00:30:24.312 --> 00:30:27.190
hundreds of thousands of years ago.

764
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.280
So it documents the war between.

765
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.181
And so, I must go back even further

766
00:30:32.181 --> 00:30:34.197
and let people understand that

767
00:30:34.197 --> 00:30:37.844
the Draco empire, the reptilians are androgynous.

768
00:30:37.844 --> 00:30:40.266
They have no gender.

769
00:30:40.266 --> 00:30:42.537
Male and female in the same body.

770
00:30:42.537 --> 00:30:45.759
They considered themselves to be superior

771
00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:49.246
to mammalian creatures because in their mindset

772
00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:52.639
since a God-mind is androgynous,

773
00:30:52.639 --> 00:30:54.313
and they are androgynous,

774
00:30:54.313 --> 00:30:56.287
they more closely represent the God-mind

775
00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:58.623
than mammalians who need to have

776
00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.649
sexual differentiation.

777
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:02.878
Also if you look at the genetics of reptilians,

778
00:31:02.878 --> 00:31:04.340
even on the Earth right now,

779
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.473
look at any reptilian species,

780
00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:09.751
you'll see that for eons at a time, it does not change.

781
00:31:09.751 --> 00:31:11.668
They remain the same.

782
00:31:11.668 --> 00:31:15.475
Mammalian species need to constantly evolve and adapt.

783
00:31:15.475 --> 00:31:17.822
So to the reptilian mindset,

784
00:31:17.822 --> 00:31:20.511
this proves that since they are so perfect,

785
00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:23.881
they do not need to change.

786
00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:26.248
Proving again, more closely related to God-mind,

787
00:31:26.248 --> 00:31:29.011
whereas inferior mammalian creatures

788
00:31:29.011 --> 00:31:30.963
need to constantly change.

789
00:31:30.963 --> 00:31:34.099
So there's an agenda by the Draco empire

790
00:31:34.099 --> 00:31:37.575
to span out through the universe

791
00:31:37.575 --> 00:31:41.043
and control, manipulate, assimilate

792
00:31:41.043 --> 00:31:45.128
all inferior species to their jurisdiction.

793
00:31:45.128 --> 00:31:48.486
There is a time schedule.

794
00:31:48.486 --> 00:31:49.885
They have an agenda.

795
00:31:49.885 --> 00:31:51.741
This one, this one, this one, et cetera.

796
00:31:51.741 --> 00:31:54.482
So the colonists that were sent to Lemuria

797
00:31:54.482 --> 00:31:57.543
were to prepare the Earth for assimilation.

798
00:31:57.543 --> 00:31:59.751
This was before the Atlantians arrived.

799
00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.654
And so there was not a military force here, so to speak.

800
00:32:03.654 --> 00:32:05.414
They were just here to colonize

801
00:32:05.414 --> 00:32:09.308
and wait for mommy and daddy to come for them, yes?

802
00:32:09.308 --> 00:32:12.808
So the wars ensued and both sides were taking losses,

803
00:32:12.808 --> 00:32:15.314
and in fact the reptilians brought with them

804
00:32:15.314 --> 00:32:17.148
creatures that support their culture,

805
00:32:17.148 --> 00:32:19.271
which we now know as dinosaurs.

806
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.220
Yes?

807
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.332
And so the Atlantians used to kill the dinosaurs.

808
00:32:22.332 --> 00:32:23.964
That's what wiped out the dinosaurs.

809
00:32:23.964 --> 00:32:25.585
Not an asteroid that hit the Yucatan

810
00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:26.790
60 million years ago.

811
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.423
If that was true we wouldn't be sitting here now.

812
00:32:28.423 --> 00:32:30.343
No life would exist.

813
00:32:30.343 --> 00:32:33.735
And so it was a very bad dissension between them.

814
00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:35.015
To make a long story short,

815
00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:38.054
it was decided to create a third race.

816
00:32:38.054 --> 00:32:41.660
Synthesis between reptilian and mammalian,

817
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.304
to create kind of a peace effort.

818
00:32:44.304 --> 00:32:46.811
And so that's why it says in Genesis,

819
00:32:46.811 --> 00:32:50.363
"Let us make man in our image."

820
00:32:50.363 --> 00:32:52.848
Why is it referring to plural?

821
00:32:52.848 --> 00:32:54.939
If there's a singular God, why wouldn't it say,

822
00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.602
"I shall make man in my image"?

823
00:32:56.602 --> 00:32:58.468
No, it's let us and our.

824
00:32:58.468 --> 00:33:02.340
All references to God in the Old Testament are plural.

825
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.934
Completely.

826
00:33:03.934 --> 00:33:08.650
And so they created a genetic experimentation.

827
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.657
The deal was to do this,

828
00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:15.601
they had to start with the androgynous reptilian body,

829
00:33:15.601 --> 00:33:19.643
break it into male and female components,

830
00:33:19.643 --> 00:33:22.918
and add mammalian genetics.

831
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:26.609
That's why in the book of Genesis it also says that

832
00:33:26.609 --> 00:33:30.000
God created female by taking the rib of Adam.

833
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.937
<v Voiceover>Genetic engineering.</v>

834
00:33:32.937 --> 00:33:36.557
<v ->It's a story</v>

835
00:33:36.557 --> 00:33:39.925
to show the separation of the reptilian.

836
00:33:39.925 --> 00:33:41.173
And that's why if you look,

837
00:33:41.173 --> 00:33:43.541
the proof is look at how human beings

838
00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:45.055
just stayed in the womb.

839
00:33:45.055 --> 00:33:47.145
For the first few weeks of creation,

840
00:33:47.145 --> 00:33:50.997
it's a reptilian androgynous fetus in there.

841
00:33:52.777 --> 00:33:55.228
<v ->Then mammalian characteristics develop</v>

842
00:33:55.228 --> 00:33:57.352
and then the sexual differentiation.

843
00:33:57.352 --> 00:33:58.589
Why?

844
00:33:58.589 --> 00:34:01.960
Because the DNA is following the sequence of input.

845
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.019
That's what its doing.

846
00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:05.929
And so that's proof of it.

847
00:34:05.929 --> 00:34:08.296
If you ever can have proof, that's proof of what happened.

848
00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:09.459
<v Voiceover>And you mentioned something,</v>

849
00:34:09.459 --> 00:34:11.081
I was listening to you yesterday

850
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:13.565
about one of the other kind of chief factors

851
00:34:13.565 --> 00:34:15.913
of this species is that we have this split

852
00:34:15.913 --> 00:34:17.650
within our own functioning.

853
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.557
<v ->Yes.</v>

854
00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:20.392
<v Voiceover>Essentially internal conflict.</v>

855
00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:21.778
Right brain, left brain.

856
00:34:21.778 --> 00:34:23.549
<v ->Yes, because we have left and right brain,</v>

857
00:34:23.549 --> 00:34:25.502
but we have a reptilian brain stem,

858
00:34:25.502 --> 00:34:28.124
<v Voiceover>Reptilian brain stem and this</v>

859
00:34:28.124 --> 00:34:30.674
right and left brain which do not seem

860
00:34:30.674 --> 00:34:33.095
to function well together without a high degree

861
00:34:33.095 --> 00:34:34.326
of training and practice.

862
00:34:34.326 --> 00:34:35.296
<v ->Correct.</v>

863
00:34:35.296 --> 00:34:36.891
<v Voiceover>It shouldn't be that way if it's native.</v>

864
00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:37.487
Right?

865
00:34:37.487 --> 00:34:41.040
<v ->What we really should have as a standard feature,</v>

866
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.950
we should have a single brain which would

867
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:46.362
be representative of a gigantic pineal gland.

868
00:34:46.362 --> 00:34:48.473
Because the pineal gland that we have

869
00:34:48.473 --> 00:34:50.682
between the left and right hemispheres

870
00:34:50.682 --> 00:34:53.891
acts as a liaison between the left brain

871
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.023
and the right brain,

872
00:34:55.023 --> 00:34:57.576
and also between physical and non-physical.

873
00:34:57.576 --> 00:34:59.337
So that's when we do our mental work.

874
00:34:59.337 --> 00:35:01.268
We center at the pineal, we balance,

875
00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:02.985
then we can do our work.

876
00:35:02.985 --> 00:35:05.683
The core personality of every person

877
00:35:05.683 --> 00:35:07.838
is at the reptilian brain stem

878
00:35:07.838 --> 00:35:12.457
and the mind control programmers know

879
00:35:12.457 --> 00:35:15.511
that if you want to really mind control a person,

880
00:35:15.511 --> 00:35:17.698
you scar the brain stem.

881
00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:19.713
You go to the core of that person

882
00:35:19.713 --> 00:35:22.615
and by scarring the brain stem it enlarges,

883
00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:25.495
and allows for more programming to take hold.

884
00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:28.236
And then it feeds into the left and right hemispheres

885
00:35:28.236 --> 00:35:30.508
of the brain.

886
00:35:30.508 --> 00:35:33.505
<v Voiceover>So here we have the third species,</v>

887
00:35:33.505 --> 00:35:35.574
a hybridized species known as human,

888
00:35:35.574 --> 00:35:38.336
which has the features of both.

889
00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:42.584
Now what did the Lyrians

890
00:35:42.584 --> 00:35:44.515
bring to the table by way of our genetics.

891
00:35:44.515 --> 00:35:46.232
Let's talk a little bit about that side

892
00:35:46.232 --> 00:35:47.810
versus the reptilian side.

893
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.501
<v ->The pure human being before the hybridization</v>

894
00:35:51.501 --> 00:35:52.566
were very tall.

895
00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:54.506
They were seven, eight, nine feet tall.

896
00:35:54.506 --> 00:35:57.023
They had blonde hair, blue eyes or red hair, green eyes.

897
00:35:57.023 --> 00:35:58.390
They were extremely psychic.

898
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:59.967
They could manifest, they could see into

899
00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:02.635
astral and hyperspace normally.

900
00:36:02.635 --> 00:36:05.589
They were basically,

901
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:09.065
if you read in the Bible the story of the fallen angels,

902
00:36:09.065 --> 00:36:11.626
that's where human beings,

903
00:36:11.626 --> 00:36:13.269
the original human beings were about.

904
00:36:13.269 --> 00:36:15.477
They were basically angelic-like beings

905
00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.524
who forayed into the physical,

906
00:36:17.524 --> 00:36:19.220
became enamored of it,

907
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.534
and solidified in the physical.

908
00:36:21.534 --> 00:36:25.879
And that's where the Lyrian civilization began.

909
00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:28.072
<v Voiceover>And we as a species,</v>

910
00:36:28.072 --> 00:36:31.048
before we go into some of the other I'd like to,

911
00:36:31.048 --> 00:36:33.810
we're on this thread.

912
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.454
Where do you see us striving to go?

913
00:36:36.454 --> 00:36:39.474
Because when you meet people, human beings,

914
00:36:39.474 --> 00:36:42.396
whatever our genetic makeup and background has been,

915
00:36:42.396 --> 00:36:47.207
my experience is that most people are good at heart.

916
00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:49.284
That's my experience.

917
00:36:49.284 --> 00:36:52.537
Now maybe I'm magnetizing a lot of good people to me,

918
00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:56.623
but my experiences there is a beautiful part

919
00:36:56.623 --> 00:36:58.543
in the heart of most people.

920
00:36:58.543 --> 00:37:00.729
Even if the outside has become corrupted.

921
00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:04.376
There's a thing that can make them cry in empathy.

922
00:37:04.376 --> 00:37:05.326
<v ->Yes.</v>

923
00:37:05.326 --> 00:37:06.862
<v Voiceover>With virtually every human.</v>

924
00:37:06.862 --> 00:37:08.440
<v ->And that's the God-mind within.</v>

925
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.094
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

926
00:37:09.094 --> 00:37:11.433
<v ->Which can never be programmed.</v>

927
00:37:11.433 --> 00:37:14.494
They can make you think that it's separate,

928
00:37:14.494 --> 00:37:17.097
but that they can never take away.

929
00:37:17.097 --> 00:37:20.255
<v Voiceover>And you hear more and more people</v>

930
00:37:20.255 --> 00:37:22.782
say this Earth life is too much,

931
00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:25.129
I don't care if I never come back to this place.

932
00:37:25.129 --> 00:37:26.547
I don't care if I die.

933
00:37:26.547 --> 00:37:28.126
I just want out of the pain.

934
00:37:28.126 --> 00:37:29.650
And then you hear others who say

935
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.446
I'm trying to work my way back to God.

936
00:37:32.446 --> 00:37:34.718
<v ->Mm-hmm. Well, you know</v>

937
00:37:34.718 --> 00:37:36.157
you can't work your way back to God

938
00:37:36.157 --> 00:37:37.459
because you are there.

939
00:37:37.459 --> 00:37:38.076
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

940
00:37:38.076 --> 00:37:39.050
<v ->You're already there.</v>

941
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.256
<v ->You just have to realize.</v>

942
00:37:40.256 --> 00:37:43.060
It's really creating an awareness of who and what you are.

943
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.292
And that's what I try to do in my work.

944
00:37:45.292 --> 00:37:49.057
To open up that 90% of the brain that isn't being used,

945
00:37:49.057 --> 00:37:51.937
and the 97% of the DNA,

946
00:37:51.937 --> 00:37:54.562
which scientists call junk DNA.

947
00:37:54.562 --> 00:37:56.791
When they put out in the media that they've

948
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:59.670
mapped the human genome and they know it all.

949
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.337
All they know is that 3%, actually less,

950
00:38:02.337 --> 00:38:06.561
because that 3% differentiates entire species

951
00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:09.836
as well as individuals within that species.

952
00:38:09.836 --> 00:38:12.533
But here's the proof of the God-mind.

953
00:38:12.533 --> 00:38:14.625
It doesn't matter if your an amoeba,

954
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.321
a human being, an elephant, an alien.

955
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:20.384
97% of your DNA is identical.

956
00:38:21.004 --> 00:38:22.668
Now how could that happen unless there was

957
00:38:22.668 --> 00:38:24.439
a single source of all.

958
00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:25.728
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

959
00:38:25.728 --> 00:38:29.238
And so on that journey, that awareness,

960
00:38:29.238 --> 00:38:30.379
well that's what you do.

961
00:38:30.379 --> 00:38:31.628
You're trying to help people understand.

962
00:38:31.628 --> 00:38:32.790
<v ->Yeah, yes, yes.</v>

963
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.978
<v Voiceover>The nature of who they are.</v>

964
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:36.602
And of course it meets with a lot of resistance.

965
00:38:36.602 --> 00:38:38.916
Because people are afraid to know who and what they are.

966
00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:41.360
They like to have their blinders on

967
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.194
that makes life seem simple for them.

968
00:38:43.194 --> 00:38:44.357
<v Voiceover>But what?</v>

969
00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:46.884
Again, I know what you say is true,

970
00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:48.601
because we encountered this as well

971
00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:50.084
with people who would rather not know

972
00:38:50.084 --> 00:38:52.291
certain bits of information and like to cherry pick.

973
00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:56.494
But at the same time, this aspect of us that is God,

974
00:38:56.494 --> 00:38:59.331
that is connected with all that part,

975
00:38:59.331 --> 00:39:01.677
you would think that that would be very freeing

976
00:39:01.677 --> 00:39:03.832
for an individual to understand.

977
00:39:03.832 --> 00:39:05.645
That that's the part that cannot be programmed

978
00:39:05.645 --> 00:39:07.181
or controlled and is at the essence

979
00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:08.152
of each one of us.

980
00:39:08.152 --> 00:39:10.201
That's very good news.

981
00:39:10.201 --> 00:39:12.131
<v ->Mm-hmm. The problem is,</v>

982
00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:13.773
religion comes in.

983
00:39:13.773 --> 00:39:17.697
And religion says to the person, you can't know God.

984
00:39:17.697 --> 00:39:19.708
You have to go through an intermediary

985
00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:20.925
in order to know God.

986
00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.130
So right away, cut off.

987
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.516
And besides that, the main religion,

988
00:39:23.516 --> 00:39:26.982
not naming names, your born in sin.

989
00:39:26.982 --> 00:39:30.375
So you're screwed before you even come into the world.

990
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:31.485
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

991
00:39:31.485 --> 00:39:32.924
So when you learn this,

992
00:39:32.924 --> 00:39:34.150
you're like, now what?

993
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.314
I have to do this and this and this

994
00:39:35.314 --> 00:39:37.062
and maybe I won't go to purgatory.

995
00:39:37.062 --> 00:39:38.177
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Right. You're right.</v>

996
00:39:38.177 --> 00:39:39.937
Exactly. And that is the answer.

997
00:39:39.937 --> 00:39:41.909
I mean, that was a loaded question, of course.

998
00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:43.670
So we can see what the obstacle is.

999
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.630
But the point is,

1000
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.017
I just want to underscore

1001
00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:47.457
what you just got done talking about

1002
00:39:47.457 --> 00:39:49.429
because I think this is where we really need

1003
00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:51.061
to start focusing some energy.

1004
00:39:51.061 --> 00:39:54.005
Meanwhile, we still have a great amount of manipulation

1005
00:39:54.005 --> 00:39:57.066
occurring over the fabrication of what we call reality.

1006
00:39:57.066 --> 00:39:58.602
Well, that's it.

1007
00:39:58.602 --> 00:40:00.159
It's a complete fabrication.

1008
00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:02.132
And maybe you can talk about the ways in which

1009
00:40:02.132 --> 00:40:05.781
our reality is being essentially projected to us.

1010
00:40:05.781 --> 00:40:08.682
For our viewing pleasure or not.

1011
00:40:08.682 --> 00:40:12.234
<v ->Yes, and I actually must say before all of that,</v>

1012
00:40:12.234 --> 00:40:14.740
that physical reality is an illusion.

1013
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.423
I use the analogy of

1014
00:40:17.423 --> 00:40:20.599
the thought is the film, brain is the projector,

1015
00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:23.104
physical reality is the screen.

1016
00:40:23.104 --> 00:40:25.121
So if you don't like the movie that's playing around you,

1017
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:27.212
change the film, which is the way you think.

1018
00:40:27.212 --> 00:40:28.449
And that's what I do in my work.

1019
00:40:28.449 --> 00:40:29.494
<v ->Change the mind pattern.</v>

1020
00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:31.212
Do release work. Deprogram.

1021
00:40:31.212 --> 00:40:32.235
Change that film.

1022
00:40:32.235 --> 00:40:35.040
Rewrite the script the way you want it to be.

1023
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.973
Why does physical reality exist in the first place?

1024
00:40:37.973 --> 00:40:40.982
It's because those who entered into it

1025
00:40:40.982 --> 00:40:44.885
refused to take responsibility for their thoughts.

1026
00:40:44.885 --> 00:40:47.670
When you refuse to take responsibility,

1027
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:51.039
and then you blame others for your existence,

1028
00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:53.941
instantly you are put into an environment

1029
00:40:53.941 --> 00:40:56.192
where what you think is reflected back to you

1030
00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:57.589
so that you can see,

1031
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:59.658
okay this is what I'm creating right now.

1032
00:40:59.658 --> 00:41:01.695
I gotta change this.

1033
00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:03.530
Of course, still you blame others.

1034
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.111
And that's why we go through the cycle of incarnations

1035
00:41:06.111 --> 00:41:08.830
so that we can learn that we need to take

1036
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.891
responsibility for ourselves and nobody else can do it.

1037
00:41:11.891 --> 00:41:14.099
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1038
00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:16.255
So, that piece in place.

1039
00:41:16.255 --> 00:41:20.041
We need to look at what the human mind

1040
00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:22.110
is up against right now.

1041
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.614
And I think it 's a fair statement to say

1042
00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:24.658
we're up against it.

1043
00:41:24.658 --> 00:41:26.483
We have to differentiate it from

1044
00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:28.339
our own personal desire and reality,

1045
00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:32.063
but let's look at the vast expanse

1046
00:41:32.063 --> 00:41:33.343
of what we're up against.

1047
00:41:33.343 --> 00:41:35.956
<v ->Well, basically human beings are up against</v>

1048
00:41:35.956 --> 00:41:39.325
amazing technology which transmits now

1049
00:41:39.325 --> 00:41:43.689
from satellites, cell towers, amplifiers on the ground,

1050
00:41:43.689 --> 00:41:47.016
even television, radio sends carrier signals.

1051
00:41:47.016 --> 00:41:48.542
We have a brain wave that can be measured

1052
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.056
like this sign wave.

1053
00:41:50.056 --> 00:41:52.562
And so what they do is they send an artificial signal

1054
00:41:52.562 --> 00:41:57.064
that mimics the brain wave so that you do not

1055
00:41:57.064 --> 00:41:59.741
perceive it as external to yourself

1056
00:41:59.741 --> 00:42:01.347
and you think it's your own thought.

1057
00:42:01.347 --> 00:42:04.286
So if they send a control system to,

1058
00:42:04.286 --> 00:42:05.811
everyone should pay attention to

1059
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:08.157
the president, believe whatever CNN tells you,

1060
00:42:08.157 --> 00:42:11.090
whatever the instructions are at the moment.

1061
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.459
You accept that and it's downloaded

1062
00:42:13.459 --> 00:42:15.806
and becomes part of your brain sequences.

1063
00:42:15.806 --> 00:42:18.867
<v Voiceover>Now is this in operation?</v>

1064
00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:20.253
<v ->24/7.</v>

1065
00:42:20.253 --> 00:42:21.331
<v Voiceover>Everywhere?</v>

1066
00:42:21.331 --> 00:42:22.323
<v ->Globally.</v>

1067
00:42:22.323 --> 00:42:23.132
<v Voiceover>Globally.</v>

1068
00:42:23.132 --> 00:42:25.553
<v ->100% of the population of this planet</v>

1069
00:42:25.553 --> 00:42:28.477
right now in this year is programmed

1070
00:42:28.477 --> 00:42:30.077
to one degree or another.

1071
00:42:30.077 --> 00:42:33.938
Now there's about 10 to 15% at this point,

1072
00:42:33.938 --> 00:42:35.441
it used to be less,

1073
00:42:35.441 --> 00:42:38.226
but 10 to 15% of the global population

1074
00:42:38.226 --> 00:42:40.828
that is specifically programmed.

1075
00:42:40.828 --> 00:42:43.248
Meaning they have the capacity to accept

1076
00:42:43.248 --> 00:42:46.961
very heavy, deep layers of programming.

1077
00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:51.074
And if you did the math, even 10% of 7 billion people,

1078
00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:52.440
that's a lot of people.

1079
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.789
<v ->See? And those 10% then have a control</v>

1080
00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:58.882
over the remaining 90%.

1081
00:42:58.882 --> 00:43:01.229
And then there's that peak.

1082
00:43:01.229 --> 00:43:04.866
That pyramid at the back of the U.S. dollar,

1083
00:43:04.866 --> 00:43:06.241
with the pyramid,

1084
00:43:06.241 --> 00:43:07.671
that little cap is the Illuminati.

1085
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:09.229
The 13 controlling families.

1086
00:43:09.229 --> 00:43:10.487
Then theres the break,

1087
00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:12.022
means no one comes close to them.

1088
00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.579
Then there's the committee of 300,

1089
00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:15.234
and then all the ones all the way down

1090
00:43:15.234 --> 00:43:18.850
to the peons of people at the bottom.

1091
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.909
<v Voiceover>And when you said that this</v>

1092
00:43:20.909 --> 00:43:23.107
7 to 10%, did you say, roughly 7 to?

1093
00:43:23.107 --> 00:43:24.257
<v ->About 10 to 15% at this point.</v>

1094
00:43:24.257 --> 00:43:27.427
<v Voiceover>10 to 15% can be deeply programmed.</v>

1095
00:43:27.427 --> 00:43:31.423
Is this a matter of simple resonance

1096
00:43:31.423 --> 00:43:34.973
or is it targeted by

1097
00:43:34.973 --> 00:43:36.850
geography, by race,

1098
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.389
or just a simple brain resonance?

1099
00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:42.014
<v ->Well, it's all of the above.</v>

1100
00:43:42.014 --> 00:43:45.848
They knew back even in the '50s

1101
00:43:46.968 --> 00:43:50.435
that the blonde-haired, actually way before that.

1102
00:43:50.435 --> 00:43:52.580
Blonde-hair, blue-eyed people have

1103
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.174
an enzyme in their genetic structure

1104
00:43:56.174 --> 00:43:58.562
that accepts programming.

1105
00:43:58.562 --> 00:44:02.978
And this is why the Nazis promulgated the Arian look,

1106
00:44:02.978 --> 00:44:05.091
not because it was more beautiful,

1107
00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:07.555
but because it was more programmable.

1108
00:44:07.555 --> 00:44:09.335
And they knew that.

1109
00:44:09.335 --> 00:44:12.131
They had a big issue in programming

1110
00:44:12.131 --> 00:44:14.008
darker-skinned people.

1111
00:44:14.008 --> 00:44:17.068
So they said, then we have to eliminate them.

1112
00:44:17.068 --> 00:44:20.385
And that's where their genocide came in.

1113
00:44:20.385 --> 00:44:22.391
And since World War II , as you know,

1114
00:44:22.391 --> 00:44:25.181
they're decimating the African population,

1115
00:44:25.181 --> 00:44:28.157
the Indian populations,

1116
00:44:28.157 --> 00:44:29.805
native peoples

1117
00:44:29.805 --> 00:44:31.917
who are hard to program.

1118
00:44:31.917 --> 00:44:34.957
The interesting thing is they started in the U.S.

1119
00:44:34.957 --> 00:44:38.247
a system or a way

1120
00:44:38.247 --> 00:44:41.544
to mix genetics.

1121
00:44:41.544 --> 00:44:42.823
Why in the U.S.?

1122
00:44:42.823 --> 00:44:44.562
Because the black race in the U.S.

1123
00:44:44.562 --> 00:44:47.388
had over 80% by genetics within them

1124
00:44:47.388 --> 00:44:49.144
because of the slavery.

1125
00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:51.112
Where they were raped by their masters,

1126
00:44:51.112 --> 00:44:52.779
and they have white genetics in them.

1127
00:44:52.779 --> 00:44:54.517
So they had this little shred in them

1128
00:44:54.517 --> 00:44:56.193
that they could program.

1129
00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.390
That's where Michael Jackson came in.

1130
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.320
He was a prototype to say,

1131
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.924
okay, we're gonna take this black American person,

1132
00:45:03.924 --> 00:45:07.423
program him to become an icon for his race,

1133
00:45:07.423 --> 00:45:10.794
and then it will be like simon says.

1134
00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:12.585
What he does, they will do.

1135
00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:14.954
What he speaks, they will speak.

1136
00:45:14.954 --> 00:45:16.245
Yeah.

1137
00:45:16.245 --> 00:45:20.895
He became the most programmed person on the Earth.

1138
00:45:20.895 --> 00:45:22.174
<v Voiceover>I believe that.</v>

1139
00:45:22.174 --> 00:45:23.699
<v ->By the end of his days,</v>

1140
00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:25.375
he didn't know if he was black or white,

1141
00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:27.560
male or female, human, non-human.

1142
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.203
He didn't know what he was.

1143
00:45:29.203 --> 00:45:31.870
And he became a liability.

1144
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:34.804
So they got rid of him.

1145
00:45:34.804 --> 00:45:36.382
But he already was successful

1146
00:45:36.382 --> 00:45:40.591
in showing a way to program the darker-skinned races.

1147
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:41.863
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1148
00:45:41.863 --> 00:45:44.263
<v ->And so now everybody can have programming.</v>

1149
00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:45.373
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1150
00:45:45.373 --> 00:45:47.975
And the rest of us are still programmable.

1151
00:45:47.975 --> 00:45:48.978
<v ->Yes.</v>

1152
00:45:48.978 --> 00:45:50.951
<v Voiceover>Just not to that extent, perhaps, right?</v>

1153
00:45:50.951 --> 00:45:52.987
Not to the extent of that 10 to 15%

1154
00:45:52.987 --> 00:45:56.006
which are used for what, leadership positions, and so forth?

1155
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:57.243
<v ->Leadership positions.</v>

1156
00:45:57.243 --> 00:45:58.513
And you know it doesn't matter about

1157
00:45:58.513 --> 00:45:59.932
economic status or anything like this.

1158
00:45:59.932 --> 00:46:02.678
They need people in every walk of life.

1159
00:46:02.678 --> 00:46:05.442
And every culture to pull in the rest

1160
00:46:05.442 --> 00:46:07.948
so there can be a global new world order.

1161
00:46:07.948 --> 00:46:10.315
<v Voiceover>And let's talk about that now.</v>

1162
00:46:10.315 --> 00:46:12.768
That was very sad about Michael.

1163
00:46:12.768 --> 00:46:13.697
All of it.

1164
00:46:13.697 --> 00:46:15.862
There was something inside most people

1165
00:46:15.862 --> 00:46:18.837
that had a deep sadness over his demise

1166
00:46:18.837 --> 00:46:21.323
and it was hard to articulate.

1167
00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:22.923
It didn't matter who you were in the world,

1168
00:46:22.923 --> 00:46:24.288
what your background was,

1169
00:46:24.288 --> 00:46:26.794
it is though something in our essential selves

1170
00:46:26.794 --> 00:46:30.954
was witnessing something that was profound.

1171
00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:35.111
<v ->Mm-hmm. Yes, yes.</v>

1172
00:46:35.921 --> 00:46:40.173
There are created in the entertainment world,

1173
00:46:40.173 --> 00:46:42.776
icons what we would call, programming icons,

1174
00:46:42.776 --> 00:46:46.680
and they are set up to be the commanders,

1175
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.836
if you will,

1176
00:46:47.836 --> 00:46:52.294
or the instructors of those who are programmed

1177
00:46:52.294 --> 00:46:54.896
with specific types of programming related to them.

1178
00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:58.234
For example, remember when Brittany Spears shaved her head?

1179
00:46:58.234 --> 00:47:00.836
Thousands of people did the same thing the next day.

1180
00:47:00.836 --> 00:47:03.002
They didn't know why they did it, but they saw her do it.

1181
00:47:03.002 --> 00:47:04.272
They had to do it.

1182
00:47:04.272 --> 00:47:08.153
That's part of the proof of the icon programming.

1183
00:47:08.153 --> 00:47:10.777
Madonna wears the kabbalah red bands,

1184
00:47:10.777 --> 00:47:12.654
everybody has to wear that.

1185
00:47:12.654 --> 00:47:14.351
And so on and so on.

1186
00:47:14.351 --> 00:47:16.734
They generally use

1187
00:47:16.734 --> 00:47:19.912
very popular entertainers

1188
00:47:19.912 --> 00:47:22.809
to be the catalysts for

1189
00:47:22.809 --> 00:47:26.025
the triggering of the population.

1190
00:47:26.025 --> 00:47:28.156
And they use politicians for this, as well.

1191
00:47:28.156 --> 00:47:29.126
<v Voiceover>And what are you seeing</v>

1192
00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:30.822
symbolically in terms of the trends

1193
00:47:30.822 --> 00:47:32.635
and what's being programmed into us now?

1194
00:47:32.635 --> 00:47:34.021
And then I want to go into the future.

1195
00:47:34.021 --> 00:47:36.422
<v ->They're basically creating a situation</v>

1196
00:47:36.422 --> 00:47:39.803
where the population will be very androgynous.

1197
00:47:39.803 --> 00:47:41.968
Boys that look like girls, girls that look like boys.

1198
00:47:41.968 --> 00:47:45.264
No sense of self-identity.

1199
00:47:45.264 --> 00:47:48.240
No sense of national identity.

1200
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.556
Basically strip you of everything that you could

1201
00:47:51.556 --> 00:47:53.668
possibly find out about yourself.

1202
00:47:53.668 --> 00:47:56.335
You become what you think you're supposed to become.

1203
00:47:56.335 --> 00:47:58.063
What they tell you to dress in,

1204
00:47:58.063 --> 00:47:59.844
what they tell you to learn,

1205
00:47:59.844 --> 00:48:01.283
what they tell you to like.

1206
00:48:01.283 --> 00:48:02.883
The music, et cetera.

1207
00:48:02.883 --> 00:48:05.529
This is being programmed into every single person,

1208
00:48:05.529 --> 00:48:07.023
even education-wise.

1209
00:48:07.023 --> 00:48:08.664
There was a program in the '90s called

1210
00:48:08.664 --> 00:48:13.177
Education 2000 where globally the same history,

1211
00:48:13.177 --> 00:48:16.706
false history, had to be taught in every single country.

1212
00:48:16.706 --> 00:48:17.997
<v Voiceover>Is this to this day?</v>

1213
00:48:17.997 --> 00:48:20.674
<v ->It's very successfully accomplished.</v>

1214
00:48:20.674 --> 00:48:24.739
I was in Cambodia in 2002

1215
00:48:25.779 --> 00:48:29.558
and you know, Cambodia, it's a third world country.

1216
00:48:29.558 --> 00:48:31.038
And these little children would

1217
00:48:31.038 --> 00:48:33.006
come up to me and they'd say, "Where are you from?"

1218
00:48:33.006 --> 00:48:33.934
The United States.

1219
00:48:33.934 --> 00:48:35.234
"The United States."

1220
00:48:35.234 --> 00:48:36.835
Then all of the sudden, wrote,

1221
00:48:36.835 --> 00:48:38.807
"The United States. Capital Washington D.C."

1222
00:48:38.807 --> 00:48:41.772
And they'd go through all the...

1223
00:48:42.812 --> 00:48:45.429
American children don't know some of these things.

1224
00:48:45.429 --> 00:48:46.474
Bump, bump, bump.

1225
00:48:46.474 --> 00:48:47.850
They knew every characteristics of what

1226
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:48.800
they were supposed to,

1227
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.282
and it was like they (tsst) switched.

1228
00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:51.401
They knew exactly what to repeat.

1229
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:52.532
And that was everywhere.

1230
00:48:52.532 --> 00:48:54.185
In the Philippines, and Cambodia, and Europe.

1231
00:48:54.185 --> 00:48:56.788
They all knew the same information.

1232
00:48:56.788 --> 00:48:58.090
<v Voiceover>So this is to give us globally</v>

1233
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.828
the same script to go off of.

1234
00:48:59.828 --> 00:49:01.481
<v ->So that in the next generation,</v>

1235
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:03.935
no one's gonna remember what they learned.

1236
00:49:03.935 --> 00:49:05.151
What your grandmother knew.

1237
00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:06.771
What your great grandparents knew.

1238
00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:08.308
You won't know that history.

1239
00:49:08.308 --> 00:49:10.836
You'll only know what's been embedded in you now.

1240
00:49:10.836 --> 00:49:11.827
<v Voiceover>So what's really important</v>

1241
00:49:11.827 --> 00:49:14.524
to start separating generationally,

1242
00:49:14.524 --> 00:49:16.126
especially in regions of the world

1243
00:49:16.126 --> 00:49:17.895
that still have indigenous knowledge.

1244
00:49:17.895 --> 00:49:20.754
Separate this generation, the younger generation

1245
00:49:20.754 --> 00:49:23.891
off into technology and more culture and pop culture

1246
00:49:23.891 --> 00:49:27.581
to remove them from the familial influence?

1247
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:31.313
<v ->Well the idea was to break families up.</v>

1248
00:49:31.313 --> 00:49:32.690
That's why there's so much divorce

1249
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.824
and parents have to work so they

1250
00:49:34.824 --> 00:49:36.797
can't make food for their children,

1251
00:49:36.797 --> 00:49:38.078
they can't spend time with them.

1252
00:49:38.078 --> 00:49:39.315
So the children don't know information

1253
00:49:39.315 --> 00:49:40.445
that the parents have.

1254
00:49:40.445 --> 00:49:41.543
They don't speak to them.

1255
00:49:41.543 --> 00:49:43.420
They're spending all their time on their cellphone

1256
00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.583
or their video games.

1257
00:49:44.583 --> 00:49:47.623
They must always be hooked up to some device.

1258
00:49:47.623 --> 00:49:50.087
You go out there to an airport, go to a school,

1259
00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.868
go anywhere in society, the mall.

1260
00:49:51.868 --> 00:49:54.832
Their on the phone, headsets.

1261
00:49:54.832 --> 00:49:58.180
No one can be without some hook up to communication.

1262
00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.812
<v Voiceover>And it's not just Western culture.</v>

1263
00:49:59.812 --> 00:50:02.660
When we were in Thailand recently, the same thing.

1264
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.677
The parents are undergoing great stress

1265
00:50:05.677 --> 00:50:08.206
and there's a high amount of prescription use

1266
00:50:08.206 --> 00:50:10.178
for antidepressants now.

1267
00:50:10.178 --> 00:50:10.829
<v ->Yes.</v>

1268
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:12.496
<v Voiceover>Because the children are now</v>

1269
00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:14.242
going away into the world of technology

1270
00:50:14.242 --> 00:50:15.986
and they're leaving the family away.

1271
00:50:15.986 --> 00:50:16.701
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1272
00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:18.515
<v Voiceover>This seems to be key.</v>

1273
00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.840
You have to get the kid separated out through technology.

1274
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.970
<v ->Mm-Hmm. Exactly.</v>

1275
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.623
<v Voiceover>That breaks the chain of knowledge, right?</v>

1276
00:50:23.623 --> 00:50:27.826
<v ->And create illnesses that require drugs all the time.</v>

1277
00:50:28.656 --> 00:50:29.958
<v ->And that enhances the programming.</v>

1278
00:50:29.958 --> 00:50:31.089
<v Voiceover>So this is one of the big agendas</v>

1279
00:50:31.089 --> 00:50:32.113
that's going on right now?

1280
00:50:32.113 --> 00:50:33.276
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1281
00:50:33.276 --> 00:50:34.396
<v Voiceover>And what do you see</v>

1282
00:50:34.396 --> 00:50:36.176
from looking at it from here

1283
00:50:36.176 --> 00:50:40.282
to all the levels at which you can see,

1284
00:50:40.282 --> 00:50:42.405
what do you see happening to us?

1285
00:50:42.405 --> 00:50:44.602
<v ->What I see is very clearly,</v>

1286
00:50:44.602 --> 00:50:47.557
if you go back to the Star Trek shows,

1287
00:50:47.557 --> 00:50:51.066
the Borg society where they're hooked up to computers,

1288
00:50:51.066 --> 00:50:52.175
they're cyborgs.

1289
00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:54.480
They're part organic, part computer.

1290
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.445
They all have a function, and they're grouped.

1291
00:50:57.445 --> 00:51:01.092
That's what this society, a Borg society.

1292
00:51:01.092 --> 00:51:03.002
No questions asked.

1293
00:51:03.002 --> 00:51:05.626
You perform your function, and that's it.

1294
00:51:05.626 --> 00:51:07.619
You do not communicate with anyone

1295
00:51:07.619 --> 00:51:09.519
unless you are supposed to.

1296
00:51:09.519 --> 00:51:11.823
That's what's coming up, and it's already started.

1297
00:51:11.823 --> 00:51:14.255
<v Voiceover>Yes, from outside appearances.</v>

1298
00:51:14.255 --> 00:51:15.119
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1299
00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:16.434
<v Voiceover>It does seem to be so.</v>

1300
00:51:16.434 --> 00:51:17.959
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about some of the technology,</v>

1301
00:51:17.959 --> 00:51:19.730
because we're looking at,

1302
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.447
some of our viewers will have heard of

1303
00:51:21.447 --> 00:51:23.911
Project Blue Beam, and some of the technologies.

1304
00:51:23.911 --> 00:51:24.910
I'd like to speak about that.

1305
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.670
Also you brought up something yesterday

1306
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.250
I wasn't aware of with at CERN

1307
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.272
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

1308
00:51:29.272 --> 00:51:30.686
<v Voiceover>Would you talk about that a little bit.</v>

1309
00:51:30.686 --> 00:51:33.280
I think it's really important to key in on.

1310
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.879
<v ->Yes, yes. Well, first of all,</v>

1311
00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:37.525
Blue Beam is a technology that's much older

1312
00:51:37.525 --> 00:51:39.221
than people realize.

1313
00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:43.520
I mentioned in my lecture that it was first tested in 1962.

1314
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.916
<v Voiceover>Please explain what it is first.</v>

1315
00:51:44.916 --> 00:51:48.585
<v ->Yeah. Blue Beam projects holographic images</v>

1316
00:51:48.585 --> 00:51:50.676
into the atmosphere that can look like

1317
00:51:50.676 --> 00:51:53.545
a religious figure, alien, UFOs,

1318
00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:56.169
whatever the object is that you really want to project

1319
00:51:56.169 --> 00:51:57.747
that you think it's there.

1320
00:51:57.747 --> 00:52:00.467
And this was tested again in 1962,

1321
00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:02.323
a submarine surfaced off the coast of Cuba,

1322
00:52:02.323 --> 00:52:05.789
projected an image of the blessed Virgin Mary

1323
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:09.032
over Havana Harbor so that the communist society

1324
00:52:09.032 --> 00:52:13.373
would think that God is telling them to come back to him

1325
00:52:13.373 --> 00:52:15.694
and to return all the communists.

1326
00:52:15.694 --> 00:52:19.087
But since that time, and it's been so many years later,

1327
00:52:19.087 --> 00:52:21.411
they have the technology now where the

1328
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:23.982
holographic images can be picked up on radar,

1329
00:52:23.982 --> 00:52:26.425
so you think it's a physical object.

1330
00:52:26.425 --> 00:52:27.682
It can be touched.

1331
00:52:27.682 --> 00:52:30.673
There's sound that comes from it.

1332
00:52:30.673 --> 00:52:32.803
So it's quite advanced.

1333
00:52:32.803 --> 00:52:34.264
<v Voiceover>I had a conversation,</v>

1334
00:52:34.264 --> 00:52:36.728
it was a private conversation maybe about

1335
00:52:36.728 --> 00:52:40.301
six, seven, eight years ago with Drumbalo at lunch one day,

1336
00:52:40.301 --> 00:52:42.786
and he was telling me that in the '60s

1337
00:52:42.786 --> 00:52:44.642
he was taken into some place in Nevada

1338
00:52:44.642 --> 00:52:47.053
where they had holographic projections

1339
00:52:47.053 --> 00:52:50.006
in the late '60s that were fully functional.

1340
00:52:50.006 --> 00:52:51.447
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1341
00:52:51.447 --> 00:52:52.588
<v Voiceover>He was surprised.</v>

1342
00:52:52.588 --> 00:52:53.836
He said you really couldn't tell reality

1343
00:52:53.836 --> 00:52:54.956
from what was being projected.

1344
00:52:54.956 --> 00:52:56.162
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1345
00:52:56.162 --> 00:52:58.082
<v Voiceover>And so if now you say it's actually</v>

1346
00:52:58.082 --> 00:53:02.123
taking on, almost mass, enough mass to be measured.

1347
00:53:02.123 --> 00:53:05.398
<v ->They can project an image of a person in this room</v>

1348
00:53:05.398 --> 00:53:09.031
that you can touch and you'd think it's a real person.

1349
00:53:09.031 --> 00:53:10.665
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about the potentials</v>

1350
00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:13.566
and how it's planning to be utilized.

1351
00:53:13.566 --> 00:53:15.497
And how it has been and is being utilized.

1352
00:53:15.497 --> 00:53:16.681
<v ->Well.</v>

1353
00:53:16.681 --> 00:53:18.185
<v Voiceover>Or is it being utilized?</v>

1354
00:53:18.185 --> 00:53:19.422
<v ->Of course it's being utilized.</v>

1355
00:53:19.422 --> 00:53:22.803
And it's leading up to a staged alien invasion.

1356
00:53:22.803 --> 00:53:26.511
A staged second coming of Christ

1357
00:53:26.511 --> 00:53:30.521
that will lead to the global empire being formed

1358
00:53:30.521 --> 00:53:33.624
under a new world religion.

1359
00:53:33.624 --> 00:53:36.227
<v Voiceover>What's that new world religion look like?</v>

1360
00:53:36.227 --> 00:53:37.902
What are the tenants of it?

1361
00:53:37.902 --> 00:53:39.820
<v ->It's something for everybody.</v>

1362
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.332
And in fact, they a few months ago,

1363
00:53:44.332 --> 00:53:47.448
created this weekend where they said it was Chrislam,

1364
00:53:47.448 --> 00:53:49.559
Christianity with Islam mixed together.

1365
00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:52.364
So that it's going to be a religion that has

1366
00:53:52.364 --> 00:53:55.958
all the icons of the historical past.

1367
00:53:56.888 --> 00:53:59.256
And if you noticed in the last year or two,

1368
00:53:59.256 --> 00:54:01.816
suddenly all these artifacts are being discovered

1369
00:54:01.816 --> 00:54:04.225
in Rome and in the Holy Land,

1370
00:54:04.225 --> 00:54:07.367
and all these different locations that prove

1371
00:54:07.367 --> 00:54:09.222
what's in the Bible.

1372
00:54:09.222 --> 00:54:12.326
Now of course, a lot of in the Bible was rewritten

1373
00:54:12.326 --> 00:54:15.280
by the Piso family in ancient Rome.

1374
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.421
<v Voiceover>And after that again.</v>

1375
00:54:16.421 --> 00:54:17.393
<v ->Yes, constantly.</v>

1376
00:54:17.393 --> 00:54:19.130
Books were removed, things, words were changed.

1377
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:22.092
And so in order to accommodate that,

1378
00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:26.646
they're creating artifacts that back up the fake stories.

1379
00:54:26.646 --> 00:54:27.926
Here it is.

1380
00:54:27.926 --> 00:54:28.861
<v Voiceover>Make the evidence fit the theory.</v>

1381
00:54:28.861 --> 00:54:29.551
<v ->Exactly. Correct.</v>

1382
00:54:29.551 --> 00:54:30.854
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and the agenda.</v>

1383
00:54:30.854 --> 00:54:33.307
And there's a lot of that going on across the board

1384
00:54:33.307 --> 00:54:34.917
when it comes to the world of science right now.

1385
00:54:34.917 --> 00:54:37.444
<v ->Absolutely, and also artifacts that will support</v>

1386
00:54:37.444 --> 00:54:40.969
the false history of countries and nationalities,

1387
00:54:40.976 --> 00:54:43.665
that they will dig up all over the place.

1388
00:54:43.665 --> 00:54:47.098
<v Voiceover>What are you seeing in terms of Earth changes?</v>

1389
00:54:47.098 --> 00:54:50.511
You and I talked about a couple things off-camera.

1390
00:54:50.511 --> 00:54:54.029
And what's being done in terms of enhanced

1391
00:54:54.029 --> 00:54:56.024
Earth changes, particularly.

1392
00:54:56.024 --> 00:54:58.924
<v ->I will categorically state that the Earth is not</v>

1393
00:54:58.924 --> 00:55:00.599
gonna flip on its axis.

1394
00:55:00.599 --> 00:55:01.857
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I don't see that, either.</v>

1395
00:55:01.857 --> 00:55:03.362
<v ->The magnetic poles, yes, switch back,</v>

1396
00:55:03.362 --> 00:55:06.614
but they do all the time.

1397
00:55:06.614 --> 00:55:11.146
Yes, there's a time period every few hundred thousand years

1398
00:55:11.146 --> 00:55:13.236
where the magnetic poles do flip,

1399
00:55:13.236 --> 00:55:16.138
but it takes five thousand years to accomplish,

1400
00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:18.228
and its only just begun now.

1401
00:55:18.228 --> 00:55:19.251
<v Voiceover>And they also say,</v>

1402
00:55:19.251 --> 00:55:21.225
even the world of science is saying,

1403
00:55:21.225 --> 00:55:23.177
they're mini north and south poles

1404
00:55:23.177 --> 00:55:24.424
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

1405
00:55:24.424 --> 00:55:26.079
<v Voiceover>Reestablishing their polarity all over</v>

1406
00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.241
the planet as we sit here.

1407
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:28.929
<v ->Correct. That's correct.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1408
00:55:28.929 --> 00:55:32.227
But, what's been happening the last few years,

1409
00:55:32.227 --> 00:55:35.447
there has been an anomalous ELF bombardment

1410
00:55:35.447 --> 00:55:37.399
of the north and south poles,

1411
00:55:37.399 --> 00:55:40.696
which is creating stress on the tectonic plates and borders,

1412
00:55:40.696 --> 00:55:44.642
and also creating higher volcanic eruptions globally.

1413
00:55:44.642 --> 00:55:46.157
<v Voiceover>Is this HAARP inspired, you're saying?</v>

1414
00:55:46.157 --> 00:55:47.639
<v ->This is HAARP inspired.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1415
00:55:47.639 --> 00:55:51.983
<v ->What's happening is these so-called Earth changes,</v>

1416
00:55:51.983 --> 00:55:55.910
these are natural events

1417
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:57.147
that have been enhanced

1418
00:55:57.147 --> 00:55:59.377
and made to occur prematurely.

1419
00:55:59.377 --> 00:56:00.700
So that for example,

1420
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.625
if there's an earthquake to occur 10,000 years from now,

1421
00:56:04.625 --> 00:56:07.157
they'll make it happen tomorrow.

1422
00:56:07.157 --> 00:56:09.357
So it's yes, it's along a fault line,

1423
00:56:09.357 --> 00:56:10.317
a volcano's are erupting.

1424
00:56:10.317 --> 00:56:11.812
Yes, these are natural objects,

1425
00:56:11.812 --> 00:56:13.924
but they wouldn't have happened

1426
00:56:13.924 --> 00:56:16.068
to the intensity that they would

1427
00:56:16.068 --> 00:56:18.637
without this artificial enhancement.

1428
00:56:18.637 --> 00:56:21.038
<v Voiceover>So they're enhancing unstable regions</v>

1429
00:56:21.038 --> 00:56:21.753
<v ->Correct.</v>

1430
00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:23.511
<v Voiceover>That have events set to occur anyway.</v>

1431
00:56:23.511 --> 00:56:26.424
Toward what? To fulfill what part of the agenda?

1432
00:56:26.424 --> 00:56:29.846
<v ->To fulfill the agenda of fear</v>

1433
00:56:29.846 --> 00:56:32.018
and as the book of Revelation,

1434
00:56:32.018 --> 00:56:34.718
a script to fulfill of that.

1435
00:56:34.718 --> 00:56:36.295
Where it says there'll be earthquakes,

1436
00:56:36.295 --> 00:56:37.703
there'll be signs in the sky,

1437
00:56:37.703 --> 00:56:38.824
there'll be illnesses, all of these things.

1438
00:56:38.824 --> 00:56:41.853
They're making that happen, so people will say,

1439
00:56:41.853 --> 00:56:44.338
yeah, this is in the Bible, this is happening.

1440
00:56:44.338 --> 00:56:45.437
<v Voiceover>All being engineered.</v>

1441
00:56:45.437 --> 00:56:48.358
<v ->Yes, yes. And then the alien attack occurs.</v>

1442
00:56:48.358 --> 00:56:51.425
We'll never see who attacks us.

1443
00:56:51.425 --> 00:56:54.027
But it will create a fear globally

1444
00:56:54.027 --> 00:56:56.533
so that we now all have to join together

1445
00:56:56.533 --> 00:57:00.320
under one government to fight this attack.

1446
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.818
But then a savior race will come,

1447
00:57:03.818 --> 00:57:06.261
who will chase away these attackers

1448
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:08.512
and proclaim themselves really that they are

1449
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:11.488
our ancestors who created us.

1450
00:57:11.497 --> 00:57:13.573
And the genetics will prove it.

1451
00:57:13.573 --> 00:57:16.690
Then comes the cloned Christ

1452
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.557
who will have the genetics of the Shroud of Turin.

1453
00:57:19.557 --> 00:57:21.552
How could you dispute the DNA?

1454
00:57:21.552 --> 00:57:23.907
It's the same DNA. It's Christ.

1455
00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:27.810
And so he will proclaim then this is his new holy empire.

1456
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:31.500
And the new religion that must be believed by everyone now.

1457
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.635
<v Voiceover>So it has to be the embracing of</v>

1458
00:57:34.635 --> 00:57:38.102
a new spirituality to have the human population

1459
00:57:38.102 --> 00:57:40.726
voluntarily accept all of this.

1460
00:57:40.726 --> 00:57:44.516
In order to bring in the new, you must dispose of the old.

1461
00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.649
And so they're eliminating the economic system,

1462
00:57:46.649 --> 00:57:49.476
the political system, national identities.

1463
00:57:49.476 --> 00:57:52.292
Wiped away so the new one can be imposed.

1464
00:57:52.292 --> 00:57:56.601
<v Voiceover>You talk about parallel realities in your talk</v>

1465
00:57:56.601 --> 00:57:59.907
and one of them is that,

1466
00:57:59.907 --> 00:58:02.361
that's one way, that is one potential reality.

1467
00:58:02.361 --> 00:58:04.622
There's another potential reality,

1468
00:58:04.622 --> 00:58:06.360
if you'd like to speak to that for just a moment,

1469
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.842
even though it deserves hours.

1470
00:58:07.842 --> 00:58:10.127
<v ->Yeah, there's infinite realities.</v>

1471
00:58:10.127 --> 00:58:12.655
And simultaneous existence, parallel universes,

1472
00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.211
whatever you want to call it.

1473
00:58:14.211 --> 00:58:15.727
And it's like, think of a radio.

1474
00:58:15.727 --> 00:58:17.721
You turn the dial a little bit, there's a new station,

1475
00:58:17.721 --> 00:58:18.927
there's another station, another.

1476
00:58:18.927 --> 00:58:21.133
All different, on the same radio.

1477
00:58:21.133 --> 00:58:23.566
And so in existence God-mind allows

1478
00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.603
every possibility to occur.

1479
00:58:25.603 --> 00:58:27.139
That's how it knows itself.

1480
00:58:27.139 --> 00:58:28.952
If this happens, what's the result?

1481
00:58:28.952 --> 00:58:31.811
All possibilities exist.

1482
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:36.077
But in the God-mind, the information is already known.

1483
00:58:36.077 --> 00:58:40.237
On the physical reality, we have not yet become aware of it,

1484
00:58:40.237 --> 00:58:42.349
so for us it's sequential and linear

1485
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:45.154
when it is really simultaneous.

1486
00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.903
Every thought that a person has

1487
00:58:46.903 --> 00:58:50.636
creates a potential reality, or a split in the timeline.

1488
00:58:50.636 --> 00:58:52.631
So if you decide to have lunch one day

1489
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:55.255
it would create a timeline that's different

1490
00:58:55.255 --> 00:58:57.047
than if you didn't decide to have lunch that day.

1491
00:58:57.047 --> 00:58:58.508
And the simplest thought can create

1492
00:58:58.508 --> 00:59:00.726
an alternate parallel universe.

1493
00:59:00.726 --> 00:59:04.162
So there's versions of you that live in Alaska.

1494
00:59:04.162 --> 00:59:06.252
There's versions of you that are Chinese,

1495
00:59:06.252 --> 00:59:08.107
or who's an amoeba.

1496
00:59:08.107 --> 00:59:11.702
Everything that you could possibly think of, you exist.

1497
00:59:11.702 --> 00:59:14.379
And that's part of the Over Soul Matrix,

1498
00:59:14.379 --> 00:59:16.459
and that's where they know how to program you

1499
00:59:16.459 --> 00:59:18.529
into personalities because they know your

1500
00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:21.526
Over Soul Matrix and then they superimpose

1501
00:59:21.526 --> 00:59:24.449
over that your programming matrix.

1502
00:59:24.449 --> 00:59:27.381
So if you were a Templar in the 1100s,

1503
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:30.722
they can program an alter in you that's a Templar,

1504
00:59:30.722 --> 00:59:32.094
because it's part of you.

1505
00:59:32.094 --> 00:59:33.480
See? That's the thing.

1506
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.295
They can't put in you what doesn't already exist.

1507
00:59:36.295 --> 00:59:38.504
So it has to be a foundational mind pattern first.

1508
00:59:38.504 --> 00:59:40.478
But this leads to potentials

1509
00:59:40.478 --> 00:59:43.123
so that whatever you decide to do in life,

1510
00:59:43.123 --> 00:59:46.674
every choice that you make, creates a timeline.

1511
00:59:46.674 --> 00:59:49.927
And every time you change your decisions,

1512
00:59:49.927 --> 00:59:51.784
you're altering that timeline.

1513
00:59:51.784 --> 00:59:55.260
Now to the individual, it seems like an even flow.

1514
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.746
But to someone who's standing back

1515
00:59:57.746 --> 00:59:59.815
and looking at the simultaneous existences,

1516
00:59:59.815 --> 01:00:03.584
you say okay, here's Stuart where he was married,

1517
01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:06.880
and here he is when he decided never to get married.

1518
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.476
It's the same Stuart, but different experiences.

1519
01:00:11.476 --> 01:00:13.461
<v Voiceover>We'll say different thought form realities.</v>

1520
01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:15.529
<v ->Exactly correct. Exactly correct.</v>

1521
01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.321
And so there's an infinite.

1522
01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:19.657
It's a matter of where you focus.

1523
01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:21.406
What choices do you want to make

1524
01:00:21.406 --> 01:00:24.073
and which ones are you going to follow.

1525
01:00:24.073 --> 01:00:27.304
<v Voiceover>So as we sit here in this hotel in this room,</v>

1526
01:00:27.304 --> 01:00:28.627
and we're at this conference,

1527
01:00:28.627 --> 01:00:29.875
and we're looking around at all

1528
01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:30.550
the other people on the planet,

1529
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:32.726
the planes flying overhead and cars driving past.

1530
01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:36.504
This is a collective rendering of reality.

1531
01:00:36.504 --> 01:00:40.109
<v ->We have, those of us participating in this experience,</v>

1532
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:44.077
have decided the commonality of the experience.

1533
01:00:44.077 --> 01:00:46.996
And yet it's unique for each one of us.

1534
01:00:46.996 --> 01:00:50.906
Because in the room there is many realities.

1535
01:00:50.906 --> 01:00:53.296
You might think its warm, I might think its cold,

1536
01:00:53.296 --> 01:00:54.651
you might think its comfortable.

1537
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.274
Filtering through our mind patterns.

1538
01:00:57.274 --> 01:00:59.781
But despite how many realities exist in the room,

1539
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.607
there's only one actuality and that's

1540
01:01:02.607 --> 01:01:05.232
the underlying energy behind all of it.

1541
01:01:05.232 --> 01:01:08.185
<v Voiceover>So taking this collective reality</v>

1542
01:01:08.185 --> 01:01:10.554
that we're all experiencing and what you talked

1543
01:01:10.554 --> 01:01:11.919
about earlier, what we've been talking about

1544
01:01:11.919 --> 01:01:13.711
this whole time in terms of the programming

1545
01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:15.887
and knowing how to program these physical

1546
01:01:15.887 --> 01:01:19.553
minds to these particular visions,

1547
01:01:19.553 --> 01:01:22.104
desires, and frequencies,

1548
01:01:22.104 --> 01:01:25.836
that's projected to look like a particular kind of reality.

1549
01:01:25.836 --> 01:01:30.295
Well, reality, I even hate to use that word, reality.

1550
01:01:31.725 --> 01:01:33.984
On the other hand, you said yesterday

1551
01:01:33.984 --> 01:01:36.747
there's another potential that you can see out there.

1552
01:01:36.747 --> 01:01:40.410
It's a lesser of or maybe

1553
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:42.639
not even a lesser of reality

1554
01:01:42.639 --> 01:01:45.963
having to do with, how do you say the belt,

1555
01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:47.023
<v ->The Kuiper Belt.</v>

1556
01:01:47.023 --> 01:01:48.526
<v Voiceover>Kuiper Belt.</v>

1557
01:01:48.526 --> 01:01:50.360
And yet, if you'll explain that.

1558
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.643
And yet, is there a third reality?

1559
01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:56.825
Is there a third potential reality that we can co-create?

1560
01:01:58.055 --> 01:02:01.625
<v ->We can create infinite realities.</v>

1561
01:02:02.935 --> 01:02:05.736
In one of them we have the situation

1562
01:02:05.736 --> 01:02:07.379
where these beings in the Kuiper Belt

1563
01:02:07.379 --> 01:02:11.207
decide to take away the Illuminati

1564
01:02:11.207 --> 01:02:13.138
from the Earth and impose their own agenda.

1565
01:02:13.138 --> 01:02:17.320
There are realities where the Illuminati do not leave.

1566
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.826
There are realities where they never existed

1567
01:02:19.826 --> 01:02:22.449
in the first place, and so on and so on.

1568
01:02:22.449 --> 01:02:26.097
And so here we are at this point where

1569
01:02:26.097 --> 01:02:29.649
collectively as a species and individually,

1570
01:02:29.649 --> 01:02:32.017
we have to decide which one are we going

1571
01:02:32.017 --> 01:02:33.479
to accept as our personal reality

1572
01:02:33.479 --> 01:02:36.306
and as our collective species' reality.

1573
01:02:36.306 --> 01:02:37.526
<v Voiceover>Is there a none of the above</v>

1574
01:02:37.526 --> 01:02:38.880
that we're seeing right now?

1575
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.407
<v ->Well, there's always a path that must be taken.</v>

1576
01:02:41.407 --> 01:02:45.397
And which one we decide is a choice.

1577
01:02:45.397 --> 01:02:47.412
But a path will be taken.

1578
01:02:47.412 --> 01:02:49.497
There's no such thing as no choice.

1579
01:02:49.497 --> 01:02:50.684
There's always a choice.

1580
01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.870
<v Voiceover>But are you saying it's those two.</v>

1581
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.054
One of those two?

1582
01:02:54.054 --> 01:02:55.185
<v ->Those are the two main ones.</v>

1583
01:02:55.185 --> 01:02:56.421
<v Voiceover>The two main ones.</v>

1584
01:02:56.421 --> 01:02:59.162
<v ->Yes, and of course, I may not know all</v>

1585
01:02:59.162 --> 01:03:02.405
the possible interjections of things that may occur.

1586
01:03:02.405 --> 01:03:03.706
<v Voiceover>But those are the two most obvious</v>

1587
01:03:03.706 --> 01:03:04.986
that are presenting at this time.

1588
01:03:04.986 --> 01:03:06.106
<v ->Those are the two. Correct.</v>

1589
01:03:06.106 --> 01:03:07.496
<v Voiceover>From our collective reality.</v>

1590
01:03:07.496 --> 01:03:08.686
<v ->Those are the two most obvious ones look</v>

1591
01:03:08.686 --> 01:03:10.062
like this is what's going to happen.

1592
01:03:10.062 --> 01:03:12.708
One of these.

1593
01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:13.906
<v Voiceover>Back to you.</v>

1594
01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:15.250
Back on a personal level again

1595
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.267
and having worked your way through so much

1596
01:03:18.267 --> 01:03:20.638
trauma that the rest of us will never be able

1597
01:03:20.638 --> 01:03:22.153
to comprehend.

1598
01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:25.288
And now assisting others to find their own identity

1599
01:03:25.288 --> 01:03:28.608
and so forth.

1600
01:03:28.608 --> 01:03:30.542
What is the advice that you give people now?

1601
01:03:30.542 --> 01:03:33.400
If you can even give advice, that might not be a good word.

1602
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.259
<v ->Well, I just say what I know.</v>

1603
01:03:36.259 --> 01:03:38.925
And I tell people they can accept or reject as they see fit.

1604
01:03:38.925 --> 01:03:43.149
But the wisest choice that anyone can make

1605
01:03:43.149 --> 01:03:46.359
as I mentioned earlier is to accept their own

1606
01:03:46.359 --> 01:03:49.346
responsibility and to correct the mind patterns

1607
01:03:49.346 --> 01:03:52.482
that perhaps have produced uncomfortable

1608
01:03:52.482 --> 01:03:55.575
or negative experiences for them.

1609
01:03:55.575 --> 01:03:58.497
I know that each individual is connected to

1610
01:03:58.497 --> 01:04:00.940
and Over Soul and to the God-mind within,

1611
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.766
and that is the only thing that you should listen to

1612
01:04:03.766 --> 01:04:04.950
and connect to.

1613
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:07.094
You're already connected to it, but become aware of it,

1614
01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:09.825
and create from that perspective.

1615
01:04:09.825 --> 01:04:12.448
Because you are not a physical being.

1616
01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.798
You are a spiritual being having a physical experience

1617
01:04:15.798 --> 01:04:18.581
as you are in many, many different realities.

1618
01:04:18.581 --> 01:04:21.739
So you should create the experiences

1619
01:04:21.739 --> 01:04:25.013
that are the most uplifting, most beneficial,

1620
01:04:25.013 --> 01:04:27.669
to yourself and to those around you.

1621
01:04:27.669 --> 01:04:29.664
And project that out.

1622
01:04:29.664 --> 01:04:32.618
And if we all do that individually,

1623
01:04:32.618 --> 01:04:36.565
it will create a critical mass that will

1624
01:04:36.565 --> 01:04:40.096
spill over to the others and we actually can create

1625
01:04:40.096 --> 01:04:43.953
a paradise on this planet, believe it or not.

1626
01:04:44.383 --> 01:04:46.813
<v Voiceover>I do believe it. I'm with you on that.</v>

1627
01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:49.512
And Stuart, thank you so much for spending the time with us.

1628
01:04:49.512 --> 01:04:52.051
And as you said off-camera or on,

1629
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:54.108
we could speak for weeks and so we certainly

1630
01:04:54.108 --> 01:04:56.370
encourage everybody to look deeper into your work.

1631
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.754
They can pick up a copy of one of your books.

1632
01:04:59.754 --> 01:05:01.853
Do you do a lot of conferences and a lot of

1633
01:05:01.853 --> 01:05:03.154
personal sessions?

1634
01:05:03.154 --> 01:05:04.477
Do you do it mostly at home? On the road?

1635
01:05:04.477 --> 01:05:05.480
How do you work?

1636
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.472
<v ->Well, I travel quite a bit.</v>

1637
01:05:06.472 --> 01:05:07.889
I go globally.

1638
01:05:07.889 --> 01:05:11.046
I don't do many conferences because we have

1639
01:05:11.046 --> 01:05:13.226
our own conferences that we do several times a year,

1640
01:05:13.226 --> 01:05:15.690
which you can see on expansions.com.

1641
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:19.270
And we teach everything from

1642
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.126
how to create your own wealth,

1643
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:25.350
alternative healing, mind pattern analysis, dream analysis,

1644
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:27.185
everything that you need to have

1645
01:05:27.185 --> 01:05:28.763
a perfect and wonderful life.

1646
01:05:28.763 --> 01:05:30.769
We have that for you.

1647
01:05:30.769 --> 01:05:32.528
<v Voiceover>Good. Thank you so much.</v>

1648
01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:33.787
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

1649
01:05:33.787 --> 01:05:37.703
I appreciate the opportunity.

1650
01:05:37.703 --> 01:05:40.095
<v ->Among the skills Stuart offers his clients today</v>

1651
01:05:40.095 --> 01:05:42.323
is his expertise in deep programming,

1652
01:05:42.323 --> 01:05:43.882
Illuminati programs that are

1653
01:05:43.882 --> 01:05:45.672
embedded into our mind patterns.

1654
01:05:45.672 --> 01:05:47.251
It's an understatement to say that

1655
01:05:47.251 --> 01:05:49.129
Stuart's workshops are mind expanding,

1656
01:05:49.129 --> 01:05:52.318
showing deep levels of spiritual understanding.

1657
01:05:52.318 --> 01:05:53.801
You can join him for his workshops

1658
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:56.722
or buy any of his books and DVDs by going to his website

1659
01:05:56.722 --> 01:06:00.109

1660
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:04.110
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
