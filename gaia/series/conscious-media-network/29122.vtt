00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.755
<v ->Christine Page takes her gloves off</v>

2
00:00:02.755 --> 00:00:05.623
in her analysis of how our species became compromised

3
00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:07.258
in our levels of awareness

4
00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:10.197
in the second part of our most recent interview with her.

5
00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:11.930
This comes from her newest book,

6
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.367
2012 in the Galactic Center, a very different view

7
00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.270
of the opportunities associated with this date.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.839
In it, she says we need to take a fresh view

9
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.808
of the message in the Bible regarding the Tower of Babel

10
00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:27.112
and the ruination of communication between earth's people.

11
00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:31.900 line:15% 
(ethereal music)

12
00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:38.756
In our last conversation, we talked

13
00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:42.060
about the various feminine and masculine elements

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.664
of how through mythology, of how we have come

15
00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.000
to the place we are in our level of consciousness,

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.535
the development, and what is going to take

17
00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:52.805
to begin taking us to the next level,

18
00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:54.806
and it was very beautiful, and I'm sure a lot of people

19
00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.642
watching this have seen that part.

20
00:00:56.642 --> 00:01:01.181
Now we're gonna go into some of the historical artifacts

21
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:04.248
and such that have taken us to where we are right now.

22
00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:05.585
Because some of this is really,

23
00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.519
when you say you have to confront who we are,

24
00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:10.468
what we are, I think we need to confront the past

25
00:01:10.468 --> 00:01:13.059
in some ways that you write about in the book.

26
00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:15.895
And one of them is going back into Babylonian times.

27
00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:17.396
And I found it absolutely fascinating.

28
00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:19.698
I have the book right here, and I want to talk about this.

29
00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:20.662
Do you mind if I read a little bit of this?

30
00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:21.373
<v ->Not at all.</v>

31
00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.198
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.203
So we're talking about the original story,

33
00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:27.271
which everyone understood from Sunday School.

34
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.074
First of all, you look at that, you look at the renditions,

35
00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:32.244
artistic renditions of Babylon, you're looking

36
00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:35.681
at essentially of Lantian temples and such.

37
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.649
So why don't you go ahead and talk about

38
00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.651
the traditional understanding

39
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:42.621
of what the Tower of Babel was all about.

40
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.390
<v ->So, traditional Lantian, the way I read it,</v>

41
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.552
and I had really wanted to say,

42
00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:47.499
<v Regina>The way we all read it.</v>

43
00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.755
How it was taught in Sunday School.

44
00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:49.513
<v ->Exactly.</v>

45
00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:52.030
So originally we were taught about the Tower of Babel

46
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.731
being a place that was built

47
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.868
and it was, perhaps I need to speak

48
00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:58.837
about it in my way.

49
00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:01.619
It was originally built

50
00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.942
as a moon worship place.

51
00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:06.177
And I think I'm gonna comment on that level,

52
00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:07.573
because I wanted to say

53
00:02:07.573 --> 00:02:11.050
that as it was built in that way,

54
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.618
these steps were quite specific,

55
00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:15.387
so the towers are Ziggurats.

56
00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:18.457
And Ziggurats would come out of Samarian and Babylon,

57
00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:20.960
and it was very similar, if anybody's traveled

58
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.496
to Central America, the same sort of step,

59
00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:26.165
the understanding of numerology

60
00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:29.701
that the pure numbers in the creation of the temple

61
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.603
which we see both in Mayan temples as well,

62
00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:34.138
<v Regina>That's geometry.</v>

63
00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:37.744
<v ->Exactly, they never made a mistake on this.</v>

64
00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:39.944
And at the top of the temple, they would have

65
00:02:39.944 --> 00:02:43.080
on top of the building, they would have these places

66
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.916
which we really haven't got too much understanding of,

67
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:49.289
but we probably understand from people like Laurence Gardner

68
00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.046
that the temple was actually a workshop.

69
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:51.823
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

70
00:02:51.823 --> 00:02:53.793
<v ->And I will come back to that.</v>

71
00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:56.026
But what we know is that they understood

72
00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:57.462
that there were certain periods

73
00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:00.099
of the month, the year,

74
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.900
when the electromagnetic energies

75
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.337
of the sun, the galaxy, the moon

76
00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:08.543
would have a profound effect

77
00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:11.308
on what was done in the temple

78
00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:14.312
and therefore, be enhanced by the geometry.

79
00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:16.414
And what we know from the story,

80
00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:19.018
we know that, if we read the Bible,

81
00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:23.189
that it is said that when this particular alignment

82
00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.225
took place between the planets, the sun, et cetera,

83
00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:28.861
the people could talk to each other.

84
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:31.063
There was a common language.

85
00:03:31.063 --> 00:03:33.365
They understood each other.

86
00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.400
Now, I don't think it was just the people

87
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.237
as in us, I think it was our ability to look

88
00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:41.105
and speak beyond the veils,

89
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:43.407
to talk, you could say, with the spirit world,

90
00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:44.810
or with the star people,

91
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.344
all we know is everybody was talking.

92
00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Regina>There was a lot of communication going on.</v>

93
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.448
<v ->Lot of communication going on.</v>

94
00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:51.949
And then the strange piece,

95
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.851
and I only really understood it

96
00:03:53.857 --> 00:03:55.987
after all those years of reading it,

97
00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:58.623
it was that God then says, "Oh my goodness.

98
00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:01.327
"These people are understanding each other.

99
00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:03.691
"We can't be having that." (laughs)

100
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:05.523
<v Regina>I never got that part, either.</v>

101
00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.600
<v ->"We must knock down this tower,</v>

102
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.371
"and we must scatter the people all over the earth,

103
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:15.973
"because we cannot have them understanding each other."

104
00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:17.308
<v Regina>And for what purpose?</v>

105
00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:20.045
What would happen if we understood each other.

106
00:04:20.045 --> 00:04:20.746
<v ->Exactly.</v>

107
00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:23.115
<v Regina>I mean, this doesn't make any sense.</v>

108
00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:25.751
And as you write about this, I just loved it,

109
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:28.452
you go into another alternative what if,

110
00:04:28.452 --> 00:04:31.591
so you're saying, "What if it was actually

111
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:32.658
"something more like this.

112
00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:34.859
"During this ancient time," I'm reading this directly,

113
00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:36.362
"there's not just one divine being

114
00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:38.796
"that many lesser gods and goddesses who came

115
00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:42.368
"to earth from 400,000 years ago as extraterrestrials

116
00:04:42.368 --> 00:04:44.468
"to influence the development of the human race."

117
00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:46.704
And again, you go into Zecharia Sitchin

118
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:48.773
and the Nephilim and so forth.

119
00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:51.777
And it says here, "When the story is seen

120
00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:56.349
"in the light, this light, it's perfectly possible

121
00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.716
"that it was one of these god-like beings

122
00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.251
"who was not pleased with the fact

123
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:01.920
"that the populace had found a way

124
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.490
"to access the vast abundance of the Great Mother

125
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.659
"through their understanding of the complex movements

126
00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.227
"of celestial bodies, such as the moon,

127
00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.430
"and chose to destroy their pathway to enlightenment."

128
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.835
This is where we get into a whole lot of conspiracy theories

129
00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:19.037
and also combined with some genuine ancient research

130
00:05:19.037 --> 00:05:21.839
about what happened in a recent conversation

131
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.341
with David Icke, he says something,

132
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:26.373
and this is about 12,000 years ago, as you put it,

133
00:05:26.373 --> 00:05:28.730
"Something got hacked," in his words,

134
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.848
"The program was hacked."

135
00:05:30.848 --> 00:05:32.552
So, what happened?

136
00:05:32.552 --> 00:05:34.953
What do you see as the extension

137
00:05:34.953 --> 00:05:36.920
of what happened at that time?

138
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.691
<v ->And it's questionable whether or not,</v>

139
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:42.460
I mean I believe that there have always been,

140
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.264
what we might call entities, star people,

141
00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:49.633
I think that there's a time for us to get beyond this idea

142
00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:53.504
that we are it, and that we've all come from this planet.

143
00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:55.074
<v Regina>I agree with you.</v>

144
00:05:55.074 --> 00:05:56.975
There have been a lot of beings here from the beginning.

145
00:05:56.975 --> 00:05:58.910
<v ->And we all come from somewhere.</v>

146
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.346
And the fact is, I mean, if you,

147
00:06:01.346 --> 00:06:02.746
I remember someone saying,

148
00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:05.517
"There were no prototypes of the pyramids, for instance.

149
00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:07.086
"But all of a sudden they could create

150
00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:10.421
"these magnificent pyramids of which we can't even do now."

151
00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:12.724
So, where did we get that knowledge?

152
00:06:12.724 --> 00:06:14.792
And it is often thought that these were times

153
00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.229
when people would come

154
00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.097
and there are so many ancient petroglyphs

155
00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:22.000
and others showing spaceships, et cetera, so,

156
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.904
these ideas that we are all bringing information

157
00:06:25.904 --> 00:06:27.605
or information has come onto this planet,

158
00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.145
really needs to now be accepted.

159
00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:31.476
<v Regina>So you're saying we have a richer geneaology</v>

160
00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:33.478
than we would like to admit, per se.

161
00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:34.046
<v ->Exactly.</v>

162
00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Regina>Which a lot of people say</v>

163
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.416
and I think that is likely the truth.

164
00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:40.185
<v ->And I remember reading The Only Planet of Choice</v>

165
00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:42.554
and I think that there are, the idea that there were

166
00:06:42.554 --> 00:06:45.523
22 groups that came here to create a library

167
00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:47.224
of consciousness, and I like the idea

168
00:06:47.224 --> 00:06:49.861
this planet just being a hologram,

169
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:52.731
a different library of consciousness.

170
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.300
Now, I believe that there have been these times

171
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.702
where beings have come down

172
00:06:57.702 --> 00:07:00.205
and it really aligns quite strongly,

173
00:07:00.205 --> 00:07:04.276
I think this period of 1800 BC or BCE

174
00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:06.845
is really quite a critical time.

175
00:07:06.845 --> 00:07:10.416
We would say it was the beginning of the age of Aries

176
00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:12.584
where they just got the matriarchal age

177
00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:14.418
was the age or Taurus.

178
00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:16.888
<v Regina>There was the 18th dynasty you speak of.</v>

179
00:07:16.888 --> 00:07:18.523
<v ->Again, same, yes.</v>

180
00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:22.927
This seems to be quite important in that period of time.

181
00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:25.874
Lot of people write about that.

182
00:07:25.874 --> 00:07:29.233
It feels that towards around 2000 to 4000 BC,

183
00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:32.404
very matriarchal, lot of evidence of cultures living

184
00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:34.840
on the earth with the earth.

185
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.444
But then there was this switch over to the more patriarchal,

186
00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:40.813
and reading from Laurence Gardner's work,

187
00:07:40.813 --> 00:07:43.950
of course, when he speaks about prior to that,

188
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.184
the kings and the priests and the shamans

189
00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:49.488
would drink menstrual blood to be able to travel

190
00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:52.458
through the veil to the Great Mother

191
00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:54.226
to bring back the riches.

192
00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:56.394
Because they knew that DMT,

193
00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:58.830
the great hallucinogenic chemical

194
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.299
was in menstrual blood, interestingly.

195
00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:04.469
And that, of course, is why women have different,

196
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:07.538
during their menses, they have that side of being able

197
00:08:07.538 --> 00:08:10.376
to be more psychic.

198
00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:14.111
But around that 1800 period, there seemed to be a shift

199
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:16.214
and that was when manna from heaven

200
00:08:16.214 --> 00:08:18.350
started to be talked about.

201
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.938
And I know that others of your speakers,

202
00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:22.353
I know William Henry would have spoken about that,

203
00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.824
that there was this idea that came down

204
00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:29.227
and Laurence Henry, excuse me, Laurence Gardner,

205
00:08:29.227 --> 00:08:32.396
and William Henry both talked about this time web

206
00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:35.266
they found that they could produce monoatomic gold,

207
00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:38.802
white gold, and that they could ingest this,

208
00:08:38.802 --> 00:08:41.673
and that they would have that same trip,

209
00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:43.040
the DMT would be produced

210
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.676
and they could trip out of that time.

211
00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:47.346
Now, whether that manna from heaven

212
00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:51.081
was given them by spacemen, by ETs,

213
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:52.917
whatever was happening,

214
00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:56.387
but it feels that this story didn't like the idea

215
00:08:56.387 --> 00:09:00.659
that anybody should be able to get hands on that white gold.

216
00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:03.896
If anybody, it should only be the kings

217
00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:06.597
and the priests and the shamans.

218
00:09:06.597 --> 00:09:09.835
<v Regina>Yes, in fact, it was, I think it says here,</v>

219
00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:13.738
it was, there were a lot of interested parties

220
00:09:13.738 --> 00:09:16.373
that preferred that we remain ignorant.

221
00:09:16.373 --> 00:09:17.375
<v ->Exactly.</v>

222
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.043
<v Regina>Now, let's get into what that means</v>

223
00:09:19.043 --> 00:09:20.779
in terms of our DNA.

224
00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:21.879
Let's look at that journey.

225
00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:23.113
<v ->Okay.</v>

226
00:09:23.113 --> 00:09:27.985
So, in that period of time,

227
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:31.322
it is suggested that there was a manipulation

228
00:09:31.322 --> 00:09:32.957
of our DNA.

229
00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:35.394
We went from being a 12-strand DNA

230
00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:38.196
down to a two strands of DNA

231
00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:40.131
making up a chromosome.

232
00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:42.900
I have to say that I think they should may have even

233
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.436
been manipulated earlier on as well.

234
00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:48.272
I want to say that I think just 3,000 years ago

235
00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:50.042
is not very long.

236
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:50.842
<v Regina>No.</v>

237
00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:53.177
<v ->And, so it makes me feel that, you know,</v>

238
00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:56.213
how we often think, "Wow, 3,000 years, long time."

239
00:09:56.213 --> 00:09:58.482
<v Regina>No, no, no, this happened for longer than that.</v>

240
00:09:58.482 --> 00:10:00.385
<v ->When I went to see Jurassic Park,</v>

241
00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:03.121
and I saw that, I thought, actually,

242
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:05.656
this was during the reptilian stage,

243
00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:07.191
that this manipulation took place,

244
00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:08.893
and we're talking billions of years back,

245
00:10:08.893 --> 00:10:09.927
or millions of years back.

246
00:10:09.927 --> 00:10:12.564
So I'm just saying that I think it's hard for us

247
00:10:12.564 --> 00:10:14.431
to get our heads around big figures

248
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:16.700
when it comes to humanity.

249
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.402
But if you speak to the ancient people,

250
00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:21.940
they will talk about being around for 100,000 years

251
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.043
or Lemurian being at his height at 45,000 years,

252
00:10:25.043 --> 00:10:28.212
so I'm sorry to kind of say, I don't think it was just

253
00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:31.449
during that period of time, about 1800 BC

254
00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:33.051
that this all happened.

255
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:34.186
<v Regina>No, much further back.</v>

256
00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:35.186
<v ->Much further back.</v>

257
00:10:35.186 --> 00:10:38.357
But I believe that there would have been a way

258
00:10:38.357 --> 00:10:40.290
of switching on and off DNA

259
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.194
that at this present period of time,

260
00:10:42.194 --> 00:10:44.229
we don't know the difference.

261
00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:45.997
<v Regina>No, we don't, which is,</v>

262
00:10:45.997 --> 00:10:48.934
okay, now if you go back into a lot of the work

263
00:10:48.934 --> 00:10:51.735
of Sitchin and others, they talk openly

264
00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:54.072
about genetic engineering and manipulation,

265
00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:56.607
and so, of course, the understanding of DNA

266
00:10:56.607 --> 00:10:59.177
would have been, it's obvious.

267
00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:00.946
And so there would have been the potential

268
00:11:00.946 --> 00:11:04.283
for it to have been rewired engineered, anyway,

269
00:11:04.283 --> 00:11:08.086
that the engineers would choose.

270
00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:09.554
And so how does this bridge

271
00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:12.990
from Babylonian times into now?

272
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.794
<v ->I feel that we probably knew how we could do it chemically</v>

273
00:11:16.794 --> 00:11:18.662
as much as we could do it anything else.

274
00:11:18.662 --> 00:11:20.766
My mind goes to that we do know

275
00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:24.903
during the Lemurian period, 45,000 years ago at least,

276
00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:27.988
there was mixing of animal and human...

277
00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:33.545
genomes or genes, so it was again, very old.

278
00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:36.214
But it feels that the ability to switch off

279
00:11:36.214 --> 00:11:40.285
or to manipulate, may not have necessarily been

280
00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:43.221
to separate those strands, but to make sure

281
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:44.888
that a lot of the information

282
00:11:44.888 --> 00:11:47.559
wasn't expressed or replicated.

283
00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:51.462
As we know that 90% of the genome program

284
00:11:51.462 --> 00:11:53.762
if we look at the gene, we actually don't know

285
00:11:53.762 --> 00:11:55.098
what 90% does.

286
00:11:55.098 --> 00:11:58.339
We call it trash DNA, or junk DNA.

287
00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:01.639
But I want to say that I think it isn't just switched off,

288
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:04.575
I think that it's actually interacting on other levels

289
00:12:04.575 --> 00:12:06.945
that we as scientists can't yet meet.

290
00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:08.111
<v Regina>Yes, more invisible realm.</v>

291
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:08.947
<v ->More invisible.</v>

292
00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:11.649
But the other side of this was our disconnect

293
00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:14.585
from the planets, from the moon,

294
00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:16.188
from our understanding of galaxy.

295
00:12:16.188 --> 00:12:19.923
I think that once we stopped making

296
00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:23.260
somehow a veil was put around us

297
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.796
so that we could no longer be influenced

298
00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:27.664
by the moon as we did in the past,

299
00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.766
or the galaxy, et cetera.

300
00:12:29.766 --> 00:12:30.801
And that, I think,

301
00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:33.704
is what the manipulation that took place

302
00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:35.255
at that time.

303
00:12:36.173 --> 00:12:37.258
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

304
00:12:37.258 --> 00:12:38.386
So if I come back to the--

305
00:12:38.386 --> 00:12:39.510
<v ->So if I may come back to the sun,</v>

306
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.701
come back to the moon.

307
00:12:40.701 --> 00:12:41.650
I just want to say

308
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.915
that the moon itself is not feminine,

309
00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:46.284
and a lot of people see it as just feminine.

310
00:12:46.284 --> 00:12:47.818
Okay, the moon is not feminine.

311
00:12:47.818 --> 00:12:50.388
It's had as many moon gods as goddesses,

312
00:12:50.388 --> 00:12:53.357
and usually they would be both together.

313
00:12:53.357 --> 00:12:55.160
And the story would be like a tree

314
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.695
that the female the moon god, goddess

315
00:12:57.695 --> 00:13:00.564
would be the trunk, and after that would come the moon god

316
00:13:00.564 --> 00:13:02.233
which were the branches.

317
00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:03.868
And we see that in looking

318
00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:06.203
at the dark giving birth to the light,

319
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:09.973
and then the light giving back to the dark again.

320
00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:13.111
And the last moon god of Babylonian times

321
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:15.815
was actually called sin.

322
00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:20.318
And I feel that the beginning of the fear of sin

323
00:13:20.318 --> 00:13:24.389
or the separation from sin was when we moved

324
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:27.424
from a lunar calendar, a lunar connection,

325
00:13:27.424 --> 00:13:30.029
to a solar connection.

326
00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:32.496
We went from an understanding of cycles

327
00:13:32.496 --> 00:13:35.199
which the lunar, the moon shows us,

328
00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:38.102
to an understanding of something just being present.

329
00:13:38.102 --> 00:13:40.872
That was our disconnect, when we started to relate

330
00:13:40.872 --> 00:13:43.074
somehow much more fully to the sun,

331
00:13:43.074 --> 00:13:47.778
than we did to cycles, which the moon was an example of.

332
00:13:47.778 --> 00:13:49.880
<v Regina>And this is where you believe the,</v>

333
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.584
everything attendant with the notion of sin

334
00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:53.685
became really prevalent.

335
00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:54.319
<v ->Exactly.</v>

336
00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:58.189
And so we know that every new religion starts to paganize

337
00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:00.792
the old religion, so when we use the word,

338
00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:02.860
don't follow sin, it was really,

339
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.497
don't go along that lunar side.

340
00:14:05.497 --> 00:14:08.331
Now what's interesting is that the only culture

341
00:14:08.331 --> 00:14:12.371
that still has a pure lunar calendar is Islam.

342
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:15.906
And, of course, it's there in their crescent moons.

343
00:14:15.906 --> 00:14:19.544
And, even though Hebrew and Chinese both have a lunar-solar,

344
00:14:19.544 --> 00:14:23.313
it's only Islam that kept the lunar cycle.

345
00:14:23.313 --> 00:14:24.716
And where was Samaria?

346
00:14:24.716 --> 00:14:26.218
<v Regina>Which makes sense, of course, right there.</v>

347
00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:26.984
<v ->Exactly.</v>

348
00:14:26.984 --> 00:14:28.186
Where was Samaria and Babylonia?

349
00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:29.554
In southern Iraq.

350
00:14:29.554 --> 00:14:32.589
And so what I feel is going on at this present time

351
00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:35.492
is the war's continuing between the lunar

352
00:14:35.492 --> 00:14:39.096
and the solar influences, between those who followed one,

353
00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:41.465
and one of those who followed the other.

354
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:42.533
<v Regina>That puts a totally</v>

355
00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:44.102
different spin on it, doesn't it?

356
00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:46.370
<v ->And that's why we had to get there</v>

357
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.371
to make that battle happen, if you want to say

358
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.474
look at it that way.

359
00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:50.809
I mean, this has to be finished.

360
00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:53.344
And it isn't about one beating another,

361
00:14:53.344 --> 00:14:56.147
it was actually both of them coming together.

362
00:14:56.147 --> 00:14:59.083
But, this god that I spoke about here

363
00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:01.852
in this knocking down the Tower of Babel,

364
00:15:01.852 --> 00:15:04.789
you know, he is known as Yahweh.

365
00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:06.392
But in many ancients cultures,

366
00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:09.193
they see Yahweh as just a storm god.

367
00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:12.362
I, a god that was given some deity.

368
00:15:12.362 --> 00:15:16.300
But not the all encompassing.

369
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.404
And I know that that may shock some people,

370
00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:22.607
but it feels as if our inability to understand

371
00:15:22.607 --> 00:15:25.409
something bigger than a personalized god

372
00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:28.112
is causing us to actually limit ourselves.

373
00:15:28.112 --> 00:15:29.446
<v Regina>And I think,</v>

374
00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:32.684
you bring up a very good point.

375
00:15:32.684 --> 00:15:34.219
When you're looking

376
00:15:34.219 --> 00:15:38.390
at the ancient spiritual texts,

377
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.791
that later became religious texts,

378
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.194
and you're talking about being given

379
00:15:43.194 --> 00:15:45.630
divine information, right?

380
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.398
<v ->Right.</v>

381
00:15:46.398 --> 00:15:47.315
<v Regina>These were downloads.</v>

382
00:15:49.067 --> 00:15:52.169
I think we have to look at the notion

383
00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:54.272
that there may have been many sources

384
00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:58.376
of those downloads for a variety of reasons and agendas.

385
00:15:58.376 --> 00:15:59.843
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

386
00:15:59.843 --> 00:16:01.045
<v Regina>And they're being put forth</v>

387
00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:03.881
in parables and stories, and so forth,

388
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:06.117
but who was the engineer?

389
00:16:06.117 --> 00:16:09.320
Who engineered some of these messages and downloads,

390
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.621
especially the ones of the harsher nature,

391
00:16:11.621 --> 00:16:13.724
of the separatist nature?

392
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.493
<v ->I think so, and again, I'm a great fan, you can hear,</v>

393
00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:17.595
of Laurence Gardner.

394
00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:18.897
<v Regina>Yes, me too.</v>

395
00:16:18.897 --> 00:16:20.932
<v ->And he speaks about, if you read the Bible,</v>

396
00:16:20.932 --> 00:16:23.468
and it says sometimes they talk about the Lord,

397
00:16:23.468 --> 00:16:25.169
and sometimes the Father.

398
00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:26.704
And I'd never seen that there were,

399
00:16:26.704 --> 00:16:28.362
He said, "I think they're two different people."

400
00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:29.439
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

401
00:16:29.439 --> 00:16:31.608
<v ->And I think, once I read that, I thought, of course.</v>

402
00:16:31.608 --> 00:16:33.478
And he said eventually the Lord won out

403
00:16:33.478 --> 00:16:35.846
and the Father disappears in the Bible.

404
00:16:35.846 --> 00:16:36.580
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

405
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.383
<v ->So you get this sense of, again, Enki and Enlil</v>

406
00:16:39.383 --> 00:16:41.485
that Sitchen talks about, the kind god,

407
00:16:41.485 --> 00:16:44.522
and then the god who wanted to make man slave.

408
00:16:44.522 --> 00:16:47.325
But again, if we wanted to look at it mythologically,

409
00:16:47.325 --> 00:16:49.427
it's within all of us as well.

410
00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:52.414
<v Regina>It is, I think we just have to acknowledge these,</v>

411
00:16:54.966 --> 00:16:56.467
for lack of a better word,

412
00:16:56.467 --> 00:17:00.437
off planet culture and deities' roots here,

413
00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:02.573
and the influences have been

414
00:17:02.573 --> 00:17:06.304
very deeply and widely spread throughout history.

415
00:17:06.304 --> 00:17:09.347
And I think that's very hard once you have begun

416
00:17:09.347 --> 00:17:12.483
to follow in a religious tradition

417
00:17:12.483 --> 00:17:14.618
for a person to acknowledge that, hm,

418
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:16.755
maybe that spark of divine information didn't come

419
00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:21.125
from The One, maybe it came from a god of the day,

420
00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:22.927
who was quite capable of transmitting

421
00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:24.595
what was considered or perceived to be

422
00:17:24.595 --> 00:17:26.031
higher thought of the time.

423
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:27.232
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

424
00:17:27.232 --> 00:17:28.632
<v Regina>So that's where we get a big muddle</v>

425
00:17:28.632 --> 00:17:31.535
in the messages in texts such as the Bible.

426
00:17:31.535 --> 00:17:32.469
<v ->I believe so.</v>

427
00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.572
And I know for many people I've been asked, you know,

428
00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:37.441
"Are you telling me I should consider myself as a god?"

429
00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:40.601
In my holographic world, yes, you know, there is a,

430
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.113
God said, "I make man in my image."

431
00:17:43.113 --> 00:17:45.450
We are a small piece of the whole.

432
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.620
But, a complete piece of the whole.

433
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.287
And it feels that that's a huge step

434
00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:54.193
that where everybody's having to face is--

435
00:17:54.193 --> 00:17:55.361
<v Regina>It's our responsibility.</v>

436
00:17:55.361 --> 00:17:58.296
<v ->It's responsibility, but we, until we become accountable</v>

437
00:17:58.296 --> 00:18:01.833
for who we are, until we detect, own that divine spark

438
00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:05.468
within us, we don't have any choices to change anything.

439
00:18:05.468 --> 00:18:07.571
That while we are just victims to our creations

440
00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:09.675
or we're victims to somebody else's choices,

441
00:18:09.675 --> 00:18:11.421
we don't have to be accountable,

442
00:18:11.421 --> 00:18:13.011
we don't have to be responsible.

443
00:18:13.011 --> 00:18:16.352
But we can't do anything about it.

444
00:18:16.352 --> 00:18:17.548
<v Regina>Okay, well you're friends</v>

445
00:18:17.548 --> 00:18:19.607
with Mama Rose Perret

446
00:18:19.607 --> 00:18:20.260
<v ->Yes.</v>

447
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.319
<v Regina>Okay, and she's on our site,</v>

448
00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:23.687
anybody who has not seen our interview with Rose,

449
00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:25.021
really needs to take a look at it.

450
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.457
This is a powerful woman.

451
00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:29.561
And she comes from an aboriginal background of shaman

452
00:18:29.561 --> 00:18:32.730
and she's the last of what 200 and some generation.

453
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.399
<v ->If Tonga's in New Zealand.</v>

454
00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:35.499
<v Regina>In New Zealand, yes.</v>

455
00:18:35.499 --> 00:18:37.000
I just, the Maori.

456
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.103
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

457
00:18:38.103 --> 00:18:40.672
<v Regina>Um, in your private conversations</v>

458
00:18:40.672 --> 00:18:44.609
with her recently, she's saying that she is seen

459
00:18:44.609 --> 00:18:48.613
or understanding that we are now having

460
00:18:48.613 --> 00:18:51.282
many, many more strands of DNA activated.

461
00:18:51.282 --> 00:18:52.717
Can you talk about that a little bit?

462
00:18:52.717 --> 00:18:56.121
<v ->She speaks about now as going to a 28-strand.</v>

463
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:57.421
And I want to say

464
00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:00.793
that I believe that what she's speaking about

465
00:19:00.793 --> 00:19:02.794
is a 28-dimension.

466
00:19:02.794 --> 00:19:05.229
Before everybody starts to go and have cells

467
00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:07.350
taken out of their body.

468
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.501
It's just two strands. (laughs)

469
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:13.303
I feel that as a scientist myself,

470
00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:16.707
I feel that there's a lot of misinformation on that.

471
00:19:16.707 --> 00:19:18.943
I prefer to talk about the 12 dimensions

472
00:19:18.943 --> 00:19:20.944
or the 28 dimensions.

473
00:19:20.944 --> 00:19:24.280
But I do feel that it's as if our DNA,

474
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.518
instead of it being it's 22 different pairs,

475
00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:29.987
there's a vibration going on now within them,

476
00:19:29.987 --> 00:19:31.388
that they're wakening up

477
00:19:31.388 --> 00:19:33.659
to their interconnection with each other.

478
00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:36.461
So from Rose's point of view, she speaks

479
00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:39.497
about us moving into 28 strands of DNA,

480
00:19:39.497 --> 00:19:42.600
to me, she's saying is we are now reaching levels

481
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.435
of dimension that most

482
00:19:44.435 --> 00:19:46.338
would never even consider we could.

483
00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:47.604
And the way I would say it is

484
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:50.915
like having 28 radio stations coming through.

485
00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:54.178
Now that is having a tremendous impact on many of us.

486
00:19:54.178 --> 00:19:57.882
I have to say that not everybody is ready for the 28,

487
00:19:57.882 --> 00:20:01.686
that is no elitism, I'm just saying, 12 was a big step,

488
00:20:01.686 --> 00:20:04.388
seven is a big step, just wakening up.

489
00:20:04.388 --> 00:20:08.025
We have to develop our vessel to be able to do that.

490
00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:10.161
And that vessel is gonna be developed,

491
00:20:10.161 --> 00:20:15.161
not by outer work, it's gonna be developed by inner work.

492
00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:16.066
<v Regina>Let's look at it,</v>

493
00:20:16.066 --> 00:20:17.401
now let's bridge back to where we were

494
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:18.904
just a moment ago in the conversation,

495
00:20:18.904 --> 00:20:21.672
the interested parties would rather not see us

496
00:20:21.672 --> 00:20:23.174
continue to evolve.

497
00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:24.474
How does that play in with it?

498
00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.742
How do we see,

499
00:20:25.742 --> 00:20:27.644
what do you perceive as ways

500
00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.681
in which this is being stunted and cut off?

501
00:20:29.681 --> 00:20:31.415
In one area, I'd like to go into,

502
00:20:31.415 --> 00:20:33.584
you write about in your book is, for example,

503
00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:35.419
the tones and the sounds of the whales

504
00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:36.821
that are changing and what's happening to them.

505
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:38.622
But, anywhere you choose to go with that.

506
00:20:38.622 --> 00:20:41.224
<v ->Okay, the very fact</v>

507
00:20:41.224 --> 00:20:43.126
I know I mention the body a lot,

508
00:20:43.126 --> 00:20:45.162
but then I am an M.D. in it.

509
00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:47.097
The very fact that anybody tells you

510
00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:50.168
that your body is weak or is just a vehicle

511
00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:52.136
or doesn't have power in it,

512
00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:54.404
which the whole medical profession often does,

513
00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:56.607
the drug companies that you don't have to worry,

514
00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:58.242
it's not, it's nothing to do with you,

515
00:20:58.242 --> 00:20:59.777
it just happens.

516
00:20:59.777 --> 00:21:01.412
Any separation we have from our body,

517
00:21:01.412 --> 00:21:05.684
and the power of it, is by those who would rather maintain

518
00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:09.187
the power over us, because once when we realize

519
00:21:09.187 --> 00:21:11.989
that this is the most magnificent alchemical vessel,

520
00:21:11.989 --> 00:21:15.625
and it's totally capable of being able to work

521
00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:20.498
with anything that comes into our planet, truly,

522
00:21:20.498 --> 00:21:22.932
we have, there would be many things, I would say,

523
00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:25.536
that such as immunization and drugs,

524
00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:27.871
and many other drugs that (chuckles)

525
00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:31.208
are being given to reduce cholesterol,

526
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:32.577
we won't give a name to it,

527
00:21:32.577 --> 00:21:33.777
but many of those,

528
00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:34.811
what?

529
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.615
<v ->Statin, statin,</v>

530
00:21:37.615 --> 00:21:40.383
totally misappropriate use

531
00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:44.021
of using chemicals to help.

532
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:45.724
We went from a place where I could just

533
00:21:45.724 --> 00:21:47.724
kind of reduce something from you,

534
00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:51.161
to actually saying, "I can stop that process happening."

535
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:52.829
But, our stupidity is well,

536
00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:54.832
if you stop the process happening here,

537
00:21:54.832 --> 00:21:57.901
surely the body wanted that process for some reason.

538
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.036
Well, of course, what we're noticing

539
00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:01.205
is we stop the process somewhere it starts something else

540
00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:04.208
elsewhere, so we're having tremendous pull out

541
00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:07.678
from a lot of drugs where we are killing the patient

542
00:22:07.678 --> 00:22:10.213
from the drugs, where we really said

543
00:22:10.213 --> 00:22:11.247
we were trying to help them.

544
00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.284
And I'm being very forceful there,

545
00:22:13.284 --> 00:22:17.054
that that isn't gonna stop until the patient starts to say,

546
00:22:17.054 --> 00:22:19.589
"Hang on a minute, I believe my body

547
00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:22.360
"has some things to say here."

548
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.928
I don't necessarily want to suppress something,

549
00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:26.897
I want to enhance the way.

550
00:22:26.897 --> 00:22:29.599
Have you got a drug that can help me enhance my body,

551
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.869
not suppress, and, of course, that's,

552
00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:34.037
I use homeopathy and other things.

553
00:22:34.037 --> 00:22:36.039
You know, they're all things you can use,

554
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:38.374
and I'm not against the drugs.

555
00:22:39.384 --> 00:22:41.012
It's where are we doing something

556
00:22:41.012 --> 00:22:42.145
which would be crazy.

557
00:22:42.145 --> 00:22:44.248
It would be like taking that little red flashing light

558
00:22:44.248 --> 00:22:46.783
out of your car because you don't like it flashing.

559
00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:48.954
You know, eventually you run out of gas anyway,

560
00:22:48.954 --> 00:22:51.354
and you go, "Wow, maybe it had a purpose."

561
00:22:51.354 --> 00:22:53.023
<v Regina>Exactly, and we're not gonna mask it</v>

562
00:22:53.023 --> 00:22:54.191
with pharmaceuticals.

563
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:54.958
<v ->Exactly.</v>

564
00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.261
And you know, vaccinations, there's a lot of things

565
00:22:57.261 --> 00:22:59.631
we're doing which are really not okay.

566
00:22:59.631 --> 00:23:03.300
So first I'd say there's a conspiracy to stay out of touch

567
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.770
with the most important part of who you are.

568
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.205
<v Regina>Okay, and vaccines,</v>

569
00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:08.738
and this gets us into another area

570
00:23:08.738 --> 00:23:11.608
because it has been linked certainly in the present,

571
00:23:11.608 --> 00:23:13.344
I don't know your feelings on it,

572
00:23:13.344 --> 00:23:14.814
but let's expand beyond that.

573
00:23:14.814 --> 00:23:18.015
We went from one in 20,000 to one in, I think in the U.S.,

574
00:23:18.015 --> 00:23:21.350
80 to 90 people being born with autism.

575
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.119
<v ->Yeah.</v>

576
00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:23.087
<v Regina>What's up with that?</v>

577
00:23:23.087 --> 00:23:25.689
Talk about a complete disconnect on one level.

578
00:23:25.689 --> 00:23:28.959
We interviewed a man named Ron Davis.

579
00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:32.997
Beautiful being who talked about high-function autism

580
00:23:32.997 --> 00:23:35.265
as something different, something where a being

581
00:23:35.265 --> 00:23:37.467
of a very high vibratory frequencies

582
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:39.304
incarnating into the physical,

583
00:23:39.304 --> 00:23:44.208
there's little means to really express it in this dimension.

584
00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:47.912
But let's talk about the non-high functional autism.

585
00:23:47.912 --> 00:23:49.113
What's going on?

586
00:23:49.113 --> 00:23:52.015
<v ->I feel that there'd be a lot of things that I feel</v>

587
00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:53.950
that we need to look at medically.

588
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.021
And we never, ever gave vaccines before a certain age,

589
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:00.391
because of the immature immune system.

590
00:24:00.391 --> 00:24:02.292
Now we're giving them at birth.

591
00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:05.663
<v Regina>90 different elements by the age of five.</v>

592
00:24:05.663 --> 00:24:07.465
<v ->I know, I mean, it's just ridiculous.</v>

593
00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:09.933
<v Regina>That's poisoning the brain and developing brain.</v>

594
00:24:09.933 --> 00:24:12.535
<v ->I sometimes think, and I've been qualified 30 years</v>

595
00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:15.974
and I was well trained, and I am well qualified,

596
00:24:15.974 --> 00:24:18.175
and I listen to people talk and I think,

597
00:24:18.175 --> 00:24:21.079
is there a different type of body than I examined

598
00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:24.127
and did anatomy on?

599
00:24:24.127 --> 00:24:25.617
No, the body hasn't changed.

600
00:24:25.617 --> 00:24:27.352
It's like as if you're trying to tell me something.

601
00:24:27.352 --> 00:24:28.285
Oh, no, you don't understand.

602
00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:29.953
The body looks like this now.

603
00:24:29.953 --> 00:24:33.457
No, (laughs) it hasn't changed.

604
00:24:33.457 --> 00:24:36.060
So there's a mystery or mysteriousness

605
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.696
that's occurring in saying, "That's the same body

606
00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:42.466
"that I know very intimately from my work."

607
00:24:42.466 --> 00:24:44.302
It hasn't changed, so why are doing things

608
00:24:44.302 --> 00:24:46.469
that we know are wrong?

609
00:24:46.469 --> 00:24:48.439
And that I would want to question any doctor,

610
00:24:48.439 --> 00:24:50.031
why are we giving...

611
00:24:51.131 --> 00:24:53.678
hepatitis B vaccinations to newborn babies

612
00:24:53.678 --> 00:24:55.645
when we know that causes bleeding?

613
00:24:55.645 --> 00:24:57.682
And then we're wondering why babies are bleeding.

614
00:24:57.682 --> 00:24:59.383
These are things we know.

615
00:24:59.383 --> 00:25:01.286
So there's an awful lot there.

616
00:25:01.286 --> 00:25:04.335
I think autism also, as if you're--

617
00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:05.398
<v Regina>I'm talking about this</v>

618
00:25:05.398 --> 00:25:06.364
whole notion of disconnect.

619
00:25:06.364 --> 00:25:07.491
<v ->Yes, this disconnect.</v>

620
00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:09.626
I know that these, the children

621
00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:11.925
are coming in far more wide,

622
00:25:11.925 --> 00:25:15.097
to this greater god, to this greater consciousness.

623
00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:16.933
<v Regina>And that's the high function autistic.</v>

624
00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:18.369
<v ->And they have the problem</v>

625
00:25:18.369 --> 00:25:20.737
with being able to take in all the senses.

626
00:25:20.737 --> 00:25:23.407
You know, we've also seen an increase in all the allergies

627
00:25:23.407 --> 00:25:25.476
and the asthmas, the exmas,

628
00:25:25.476 --> 00:25:29.239
the ability to process the amount of data that,

629
00:25:29.239 --> 00:25:32.016
again, when I was a child, we didn't have all the noise

630
00:25:32.016 --> 00:25:34.384
that we have around, all the sounds that we have around.

631
00:25:34.384 --> 00:25:35.719
<v Regina>Radio frequencies, microwaves.</v>

632
00:25:35.719 --> 00:25:37.154
<v ->Radio frequencies, huge.</v>

633
00:25:37.154 --> 00:25:39.358
And, of course, if you want to look at conspiracy,

634
00:25:39.358 --> 00:25:43.327
a lot of that is actually increasing our confusion rate,

635
00:25:43.327 --> 00:25:46.497
that there's no doubt that at the microwave levels

636
00:25:46.497 --> 00:25:48.166
at low frequency sound waves,

637
00:25:48.166 --> 00:25:49.566
and we'll come back to the whales,

638
00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:51.434
things are happening that we just say,

639
00:25:51.434 --> 00:25:53.470
"Well, I can't see it or hear it."

640
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.707
And you know that you're being confused

641
00:25:55.707 --> 00:25:57.107
by these different energies.

642
00:25:57.107 --> 00:25:58.576
<v Regina>All of these energies are passing through us,</v>

643
00:25:58.576 --> 00:25:59.809
whether we see or hear them or not.

644
00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:01.611
<v ->And if you want to own any good thoughts</v>

645
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:04.814
about, let's say, cell phones, that they're oh so valuable,

646
00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:06.984
but putting your earpiece in permanently

647
00:26:06.984 --> 00:26:08.484
doesn't cause you any trouble.

648
00:26:08.484 --> 00:26:09.953
We have to know that that's different,

649
00:26:09.953 --> 00:26:11.593
and then of course, there's different parts of the country,

650
00:26:11.593 --> 00:26:13.457
of the world that say, yes,

651
00:26:13.457 --> 00:26:16.161
children should not have cell phones before 12.

652
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:19.930
<v Regina>What about a baby developing in utero</v>

653
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.567
being exposed to these microwaves,

654
00:26:23.567 --> 00:26:26.471
for example, with a brain just beginning

655
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:29.273
to develop on a cellular level,

656
00:26:29.273 --> 00:26:31.408
we know that it's an electrical instrument,

657
00:26:31.408 --> 00:26:33.276
it has to be having a major effect,

658
00:26:33.276 --> 00:26:36.213
just the microwaves and radio frequencies alone

659
00:26:36.213 --> 00:26:37.515
on the developing fetus.

660
00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:41.452
<v ->It has to, and of course, we, anything that we don't like</v>

661
00:26:41.452 --> 00:26:45.188
we block off, so after a while you don't hear sounds.

662
00:26:45.188 --> 00:26:47.058
But they're still entering your body.

663
00:26:47.058 --> 00:26:50.026
And that's easy because we say, "Oh, yes, I don't hear

664
00:26:50.026 --> 00:26:51.628
"the drumming anymore."

665
00:26:51.628 --> 00:26:53.564
But there's waves that we don't even hear,

666
00:26:53.564 --> 00:26:57.400
or not on our level, but they are passing through us.

667
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.202
And so I would say there was,

668
00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:00.972
those things are certainly causing confusion.

669
00:27:00.972 --> 00:27:04.408
I say confusion because where people cannot make

670
00:27:04.408 --> 00:27:07.278
real choices, it's the ability to make choices

671
00:27:07.278 --> 00:27:09.079
that makes you powerful.

672
00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:13.184
But it's not being willing, A. to even make those choices,

673
00:27:13.184 --> 00:27:16.018
but then, B. confused in your thinking, as you say,

674
00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:19.357
by propaganda, by media telling you something

675
00:27:19.357 --> 00:27:21.858
you make choices based on a gut feeling

676
00:27:21.858 --> 00:27:25.028
rather than actually a wisdom feeling.

677
00:27:25.028 --> 00:27:27.665
<v Regina>So that's one way to keep us disconnected</v>

678
00:27:27.665 --> 00:27:30.567
from ourselves, from source, from each other,

679
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:31.768
and so on.

680
00:27:31.768 --> 00:27:35.738
<v ->And it, you know, anything that's based on fear or shame</v>

681
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:37.240
is also a disconnect.

682
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.709
That just keeps the hologram going

683
00:27:38.709 --> 00:27:41.478
that out there there are people that wanted to hurt you.

684
00:27:41.478 --> 00:27:42.513
<v Regina>Okay, now you're talking</v>

685
00:27:42.513 --> 00:27:43.846
about big media influences,

686
00:27:43.846 --> 00:27:45.916
because the dominate media influence

687
00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:47.652
is that propagation of fear.

688
00:27:47.652 --> 00:27:48.419
<v ->Exactly.</v>

689
00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:49.722
And even climate change.

690
00:27:49.722 --> 00:27:51.488
You know the whole climate change,

691
00:27:51.488 --> 00:27:53.956
the whole global warming and, of course,

692
00:27:53.956 --> 00:27:55.325
then you put blame on it,

693
00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:59.978
and you caused it, allows me to stay in shame and fear.

694
00:28:00.998 --> 00:28:03.234
Now, I'm not saying that we do not need

695
00:28:03.234 --> 00:28:05.202
to be better guardians of our world,

696
00:28:05.202 --> 00:28:07.772
but not from a place of fear and shame.

697
00:28:07.772 --> 00:28:08.772
That is what we've had

698
00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:12.909
over 2,000, 3,000 years of telling us.

699
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:16.146
But, of course, it's not them, it's our willingness to say,

700
00:28:16.146 --> 00:28:18.049
"Oh good, I'll follow this little path,

701
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:19.584
"and then you won't blame me."

702
00:28:19.584 --> 00:28:21.984
So we need to have the courage to stand up.

703
00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:23.187
<v Regina>Yes, exactly.</v>

704
00:28:23.187 --> 00:28:25.287
Let's talk about some of the frequencies

705
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:27.792
that, I brought up whales a little bit ago,

706
00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:29.760
you write about this, and I think this is important

707
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.330
because these are very, very highly developed beings,

708
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.800
the whales and the dolphins.

709
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.867
And we're seeing just some

710
00:28:36.867 --> 00:28:39.235
extraordinarily sad things happen.

711
00:28:39.235 --> 00:28:41.539
And this is important for us to know about

712
00:28:41.539 --> 00:28:43.040
on a multi-dimensional level.

713
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.307
Can you just talk about this?

714
00:28:44.307 --> 00:28:47.711
<v ->Yes, and the dolphins have one particular journey</v>

715
00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:50.080
for us is to help us to understand joy,

716
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.750
and that recognizing joy is the energy

717
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.220
that is gonna help us to get through these times.

718
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.888
Now that doesn't mean you go around positive thinking,

719
00:28:57.888 --> 00:29:00.991
it's literally taking lightening up on yourself,

720
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:03.093
being light hearted, and they have

721
00:29:03.093 --> 00:29:05.996
a multi-dimensional beings that are telling us

722
00:29:05.996 --> 00:29:09.132
that through joy, we can travel to other places.

723
00:29:09.132 --> 00:29:11.468
We can move our energy.

724
00:29:11.468 --> 00:29:13.703
And we will know that when we get too lost in something

725
00:29:13.703 --> 00:29:16.272
and we just lighten up, and everything becomes easier

726
00:29:16.272 --> 00:29:17.641
to move through.

727
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:21.244
So the dolphins have a much deeper relationship

728
00:29:21.244 --> 00:29:23.513
with humans, they like us.

729
00:29:23.513 --> 00:29:25.883
Whales aren't so bothered about us.

730
00:29:25.883 --> 00:29:28.051
They are more bothered about the earth.

731
00:29:28.051 --> 00:29:30.787
They carry the Akashic records of the earth,

732
00:29:30.787 --> 00:29:34.491
and everything that lives within it, on it,

733
00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:37.193
under it, through it, above it,

734
00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:41.865
it's the whales that literally are the antennae,

735
00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:45.135
they pick up energies coming in from the cosmos,

736
00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:47.004
they bring them into the earth.

737
00:29:47.004 --> 00:29:50.073
And it is through their migratory patterns,

738
00:29:50.073 --> 00:29:53.810
that they literally run the grid of the earth.

739
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.215
So within our earth is a huge grid system.

740
00:29:57.215 --> 00:30:01.852
And by running the grid, the whales actually keep it alive,

741
00:30:01.852 --> 00:30:05.255
they keep the consciousness alive for us.

742
00:30:05.255 --> 00:30:08.359
We also know the elephants do the same thing on the earth,

743
00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:10.994
so it's the elephants that do that.

744
00:30:10.994 --> 00:30:13.764
And so, what is happening is that we know

745
00:30:13.764 --> 00:30:17.569
that there are situations that are happening

746
00:30:17.569 --> 00:30:20.471
where for many years the different navies

747
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:23.074
have been putting low, extremely low frequency

748
00:30:23.074 --> 00:30:26.443
sound waves into the waters.

749
00:30:26.443 --> 00:30:28.478
And we don't hear them as humans,

750
00:30:28.478 --> 00:30:30.346
but they are affecting the whales,

751
00:30:30.346 --> 00:30:33.919
because their ability to hear and sound,

752
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:37.488
and to know their way through their sound is being affected.

753
00:30:37.488 --> 00:30:39.088
<v Regina>This is very disturbing.</v>

754
00:30:39.088 --> 00:30:40.301
<v ->And they are being, you know,</v>

755
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:41.758
they are beaching, we're seeing that,

756
00:30:41.758 --> 00:30:44.364
they're fine, is there one we're seeing now in New York,

757
00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:46.596
I mean, they're appearing in places we didn't know

758
00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:49.199
they were to appear, because, and they have shown

759
00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:53.870
that it literally these extreme low frequency sound waves

760
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.007
are blowing blood vessels in their brain.

761
00:30:56.007 --> 00:30:57.240
<v Regina>Yes, they are far more developed</v>

762
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.309
in sensitivity than our brains.

763
00:30:58.309 --> 00:31:00.478
<v ->Yes, and by doing that, it means</v>

764
00:31:00.478 --> 00:31:03.580
that our ability to pick up the information,

765
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.648
remember we're 70% water,

766
00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:08.050
so these oceans that are 70% water,

767
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.987
into which the whales are sounding

768
00:31:10.987 --> 00:31:13.022
these new levels of consciousness,

769
00:31:13.022 --> 00:31:16.793
we are being affected by the whale songs.

770
00:31:16.793 --> 00:31:19.497
<v Regina>But we're not if we keep driving them</v>

771
00:31:19.497 --> 00:31:21.864
onto the beach, if we keep silencing them.

772
00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:24.568
And legislation was up on this recently.

773
00:31:24.568 --> 00:31:26.637
And it went down.

774
00:31:26.637 --> 00:31:30.707
No one understands the depth

775
00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:33.244
of what's going on with this problem.

776
00:31:33.244 --> 00:31:35.345
No one stood up for them in the end.

777
00:31:35.345 --> 00:31:37.514
I mean people are, there are groups--

778
00:31:37.514 --> 00:31:39.783
<v ->Yes, that's right 'cause Jacques Cousteau's son is,</v>

779
00:31:39.783 --> 00:31:41.483
<v Regina>Yes, but I'm talking about the legislature.</v>

780
00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:43.787
<v ->Then he went over to England, and then they came back</v>

781
00:31:43.787 --> 00:31:46.991
here again, and as you said, we have friends in Hawaii,

782
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:48.725
who every time they're doing it around Hawaii,

783
00:31:48.725 --> 00:31:49.927
they're jumping in the water,

784
00:31:49.927 --> 00:31:50.960
but then they're allowed to do it

785
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.295
while they're in the water.

786
00:31:52.295 --> 00:31:52.895
But--

787
00:31:52.895 --> 00:31:53.897
<v Regina>The powers that be are seeing</v>

788
00:31:53.897 --> 00:31:55.099
that this act's not forwarded.

789
00:31:55.099 --> 00:31:57.368
<v ->Exactly, and you know,</v>

790
00:31:57.368 --> 00:31:59.602
what can we do about that?

791
00:31:59.602 --> 00:32:01.571
It's reminding ourselves of who we are,

792
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:04.308
because, truly, it's the same as the sacred sites,

793
00:32:04.308 --> 00:32:05.909
is that the powers that be

794
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:07.578
that would prefer that we didn't tap

795
00:32:07.578 --> 00:32:10.313
into this grid systems are trying to stop us going

796
00:32:10.313 --> 00:32:13.450
to the sacred sites, are trying to stop the energy,

797
00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:14.852
so when we're at a sacred site,

798
00:32:14.852 --> 00:32:18.555
we're literally being a beacon, an obelisk,

799
00:32:18.555 --> 00:32:20.056
we're tapping into the deep energies,

800
00:32:20.056 --> 00:32:21.324
we're bringing energies in,

801
00:32:21.324 --> 00:32:23.661
that's what these sites were made for.

802
00:32:23.661 --> 00:32:25.395
But things are happening at sacred sites--

803
00:32:25.395 --> 00:32:26.629
<v Regina>Well, for example,</v>

804
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:28.299
if you try to go to Stonehenge,

805
00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:30.567
you can't get near Stonehenge anymore,

806
00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:31.769
you can't go in the circle.

807
00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:33.603
You can, if you have special permission,

808
00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:34.672
and a guide to take you in,

809
00:32:34.672 --> 00:32:36.573
but it's all cordoned off now.

810
00:32:36.573 --> 00:32:39.676
And I've seen this in small and large situations

811
00:32:39.676 --> 00:32:43.413
where the heart of it is cordoned off from the people.

812
00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:44.781
<v ->Yes, exactly, exactly.</v>

813
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:47.819
Or, somehow, distorted.

814
00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:50.019
I mean, even I honor people who say,

815
00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:52.822
"We like going to these places to heal them."

816
00:32:52.822 --> 00:32:55.959
Places don't need healing, they need joy,

817
00:32:55.959 --> 00:32:58.795
so that when we take the fear into these places

818
00:32:58.795 --> 00:33:01.163
we just increase the fear.

819
00:33:01.163 --> 00:33:04.436
And oh, there's been such sadness here, take joy.

820
00:33:04.436 --> 00:33:06.603
So when we go to these sacred places,

821
00:33:06.603 --> 00:33:09.140
have fun there, be joyful,

822
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.574
because that's what's gonna waken up the grid.

823
00:33:11.574 --> 00:33:13.475
<v Regina>So let's talk about some of these sacred sites.</v>

824
00:33:13.475 --> 00:33:15.747
In your book it says here, "Many were built

825
00:33:15.747 --> 00:33:18.448
"before mankind took physical form."

826
00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:20.250
Now that's an intriguing statement.

827
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.517
Let's talk about that.

828
00:33:21.517 --> 00:33:23.455
<v ->Well, I, this comes from my own knowledge</v>

829
00:33:23.455 --> 00:33:25.322
of being a grid builder.

830
00:33:25.322 --> 00:33:28.958
I mean, I remember when this planet was not inhabited

831
00:33:28.958 --> 00:33:33.563
by humans, when people had not come from the stars.

832
00:33:33.563 --> 00:33:35.999
And that this planet was a library,

833
00:33:35.999 --> 00:33:37.968
or is a library of consciousness.

834
00:33:37.968 --> 00:33:40.236
And that we created these grids

835
00:33:40.236 --> 00:33:42.906
so that we could literally create a hologram.

836
00:33:42.906 --> 00:33:46.076
I believe it's like the original Garden of Eden.

837
00:33:46.076 --> 00:33:47.910
It was a place we visited.

838
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:48.844
And every time you visited,

839
00:33:48.844 --> 00:33:50.480
you'd say, "Oh, let's create that,

840
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.865
"that would be quite nice if we created that."

841
00:33:52.865 --> 00:33:57.861
It was a place of enjoyment, of R and R,

842
00:33:57.861 --> 00:34:00.857
a place where we would return to our souls,

843
00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:03.058
remember why we were here.

844
00:34:03.058 --> 00:34:04.693
And I believe those grids,

845
00:34:04.693 --> 00:34:07.311
and a lot of these sites, excuse me,

846
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:10.333
were literally built so that they could act

847
00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:12.902
as a lightening rod,

848
00:34:12.902 --> 00:34:15.638
to keep this hologram alive.

849
00:34:15.638 --> 00:34:18.742
And again, the solstices, or the equinoxes,

850
00:34:18.742 --> 00:34:22.481
these would be time where the energy would be imparted

851
00:34:22.481 --> 00:34:26.016
into this beautiful planet and to be maintained in that way.

852
00:34:26.016 --> 00:34:29.486
And then we, of course, we know that we got so interested

853
00:34:29.486 --> 00:34:32.121
in this Garden of Eden, we ended up staying here.

854
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:33.190
And that was our problem.

855
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.425
<v Regina>Yes, and many different reflections</v>

856
00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:37.494
on exactly how that all came about.

857
00:34:37.494 --> 00:34:39.929
But they all seem to end up in the same place, we're here.

858
00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:40.797
<v ->Exactly.</v>

859
00:34:40.797 --> 00:34:42.331
And, you know, this idea of creation,

860
00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:45.203
I know I write about that in the beginning of the book,

861
00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:48.372
you know, my inner teacher that I met,

862
00:34:48.372 --> 00:34:52.208
showed me that with a wipe of a hand,

863
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:56.211
we could just clear any image that we'd ever created.

864
00:34:56.211 --> 00:34:58.414
And then we could make something new.

865
00:34:58.414 --> 00:34:59.866
That's our gift.

866
00:35:00.183 --> 00:35:01.551
That's our gift.

867
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:04.888
And that in the spirit world, that's exactly what happens,

868
00:35:04.888 --> 00:35:08.191
in the spirit world they, you know, we would say think,

869
00:35:08.191 --> 00:35:11.294
but they think where they want to go, and they're there.

870
00:35:11.294 --> 00:35:12.709
But we've forgotten that.

871
00:35:12.709 --> 00:35:13.964
<v Regina>That's where we're headed back towards.</v>

872
00:35:13.964 --> 00:35:15.465
<v ->It's what we're heading back for.</v>

873
00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:18.735
But what happens is just when someone's about to wipe clear,

874
00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:21.338
we go, "Don't do it." (laughs)

875
00:35:21.338 --> 00:35:24.707
Where's that picture I so like? (laughs)

876
00:35:24.707 --> 00:35:27.076
But we're so uncomfortable

877
00:35:27.076 --> 00:35:28.811
with that unknown,

878
00:35:28.811 --> 00:35:31.749
because you, I mean, we want to,

879
00:35:31.749 --> 00:35:35.418
we long for it, people say I want the abundance,

880
00:35:35.418 --> 00:35:37.454
as long as I can take this chair with me,

881
00:35:37.454 --> 00:35:39.056
I can take my partner, as long as

882
00:35:39.056 --> 00:35:41.701
I don't have lack of money.

883
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.060
We have so many conditions,

884
00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.729
that we want to maintain,

885
00:35:46.729 --> 00:35:50.266
and yet, we're being given the universe,

886
00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:52.636
not just the world, we're being given the universe.

887
00:35:52.636 --> 00:35:55.105
<v Regina>So how do we throw off the,</v>

888
00:35:55.105 --> 00:35:57.240
what a lot of people perceive, and especially

889
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.555
if you follow the conspiracy authors and so forth,

890
00:36:01.555 --> 00:36:04.781
the yolk of oppression.

891
00:36:04.781 --> 00:36:08.150
<v ->Um, it's about whether you want to choose to do that.</v>

892
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.087
It's just choice and I,

893
00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:11.987
I know that sounds so easy,

894
00:36:11.987 --> 00:36:13.958
but it is choice, it is choice.

895
00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:17.160
I often give the analogy of the story of the three men

896
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.103
who are looking at the elephant,

897
00:36:19.103 --> 00:36:21.198
and one of them says, "Well, the elephant is

898
00:36:21.198 --> 00:36:23.866
"an animal with a very long trunk."

899
00:36:23.866 --> 00:36:25.569
And another one says, "It's got a very big leg."

900
00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:29.621
And the one at the tail is saying, "Life is shit."

901
00:36:31.641 --> 00:36:33.876
You know, and we're among these people

902
00:36:33.876 --> 00:36:36.045
who think life is shit.

903
00:36:36.045 --> 00:36:38.715
And however much you might try to persuade them

904
00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:41.450
to take one step to the side,

905
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:45.388
they go, "Oh, no, oh no, no, no, this is my karma,

906
00:36:45.388 --> 00:36:48.123
"this is where life is a bitch and then I die,"

907
00:36:48.123 --> 00:36:50.477
or, "It's really good for my hair."

908
00:36:51.994 --> 00:36:55.531
How hard it is for any of us to just take one step

909
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:59.002
to the side of our life when we are so comfortable

910
00:36:59.002 --> 00:37:01.605
in that zone, even how painful it is.

911
00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:03.005
<v Regina>This gets into some numbers</v>

912
00:37:03.005 --> 00:37:04.775
that you have in your book, some percentages,

913
00:37:04.775 --> 00:37:09.011
which is the basically the 40-40-15-5,

914
00:37:09.011 --> 00:37:11.628
and it really dovetails with what you're saying.

915
00:37:11.628 --> 00:37:14.184
Can you explain what was, what you were shown?

916
00:37:14.184 --> 00:37:16.820
<v ->Yes, it's that point when I was shown,</v>

917
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.889
and I've been shown that several times,

918
00:37:18.889 --> 00:37:21.158
that literally, the ancient people,

919
00:37:21.158 --> 00:37:26.029
I wanted to say that back in the times of Atlantis, Lemuria,

920
00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:28.899
we knew how to harness our energy

921
00:37:28.899 --> 00:37:31.500
so that we could focus through the third eye.

922
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.570
And then through the third eye, we literally could project

923
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.374
our vision to create whatever we wanted.

924
00:37:38.374 --> 00:37:41.711
That's how all these stones were cut apart, et cetera.

925
00:37:41.711 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Regina>How they walked.</v>

926
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.613
<v ->Yes, how they walked.</v>

927
00:37:43.613 --> 00:37:45.648
I mean, I know that the stones walked,

928
00:37:45.648 --> 00:37:48.452
but our ability to create was purely

929
00:37:48.452 --> 00:37:51.620
through having clear intention, clear intention

930
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.621
which is so hard.

931
00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:54.057
<v Regina>Clear, pure, focused, intention.</v>

932
00:37:54.057 --> 00:37:56.360
<v ->Through the heart, being pure of heart,</v>

933
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.429
clear intention, heart and mind connected,

934
00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:02.533
well, we could say things got a little shaky,

935
00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:04.834
but the fact of the matter is I've always been shown

936
00:38:04.834 --> 00:38:07.103
that it is as easy as just focusing,

937
00:38:07.103 --> 00:38:10.006
and that's what you want, that's what will happen.

938
00:38:10.006 --> 00:38:12.141
It's not gonna come through the idea

939
00:38:12.141 --> 00:38:15.478
that the secret that says if you want it, it's gonna happen.

940
00:38:15.478 --> 00:38:18.314
It's gonna be by not wanting.

941
00:38:18.314 --> 00:38:21.017
It's when we have created the space big enough

942
00:38:21.017 --> 00:38:23.119
that the intention comes from within us,

943
00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:26.657
not from a mind that will only ever want to create

944
00:38:26.657 --> 00:38:28.525
that which we already know.

945
00:38:28.525 --> 00:38:30.760
So in your heart, my heart that can create

946
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.762
from a place of the unknown.

947
00:38:32.762 --> 00:38:36.332
So that when I was shown this by the ancient,

948
00:38:36.332 --> 00:38:40.403
my ancient teacher, I said, "Why won't everybody

949
00:38:40.403 --> 00:38:42.872
"want to have a clear slate?"

950
00:38:42.872 --> 00:38:44.874
And he said, "Because of fear."

951
00:38:44.874 --> 00:38:48.245
And he said, "When this happens, and I think in 2012,

952
00:38:48.245 --> 00:38:50.646
"this is what we're gonna be seeing,

953
00:38:50.646 --> 00:38:53.083
"the opportunity for change happening,

954
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:55.785
"40% of people will immediately recreate

955
00:38:55.785 --> 00:38:57.719
"what has just been swept away.

956
00:38:57.719 --> 00:39:00.724
"And 40% will fall asleep because they can't deal

957
00:39:00.724 --> 00:39:02.193
"with the unknown.

958
00:39:02.193 --> 00:39:05.695
"15% will get confused and 5% will get it.

959
00:39:05.695 --> 00:39:07.597
And I'm already seeing this, Regina,

960
00:39:07.597 --> 00:39:08.998
when I'm giving a talk.

961
00:39:08.998 --> 00:39:11.034
Now, it might just be me and my talk,

962
00:39:11.034 --> 00:39:12.302
but I'm seeing them.

963
00:39:12.302 --> 00:39:14.703
I see people glaze over.

964
00:39:14.703 --> 00:39:18.641
I see people, and it's not from boredom,

965
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:20.877
it's that they can't cope with it.

966
00:39:20.877 --> 00:39:23.112
And I see people say, "Yes, yes, a great idea,

967
00:39:23.112 --> 00:39:24.746
"now, could it all just be like this?

968
00:39:24.746 --> 00:39:28.984
"I, what I already know, can I just create this?"

969
00:39:28.984 --> 00:39:31.955
And so I see people making strategies and plans,

970
00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:35.457
and organizations and how to lists

971
00:39:35.457 --> 00:39:38.862
to maintain their waters as it is at this moment.

972
00:39:38.862 --> 00:39:41.063
And the feminine, the great goddess is saying,

973
00:39:41.063 --> 00:39:43.099
"It will not be like that."

974
00:39:43.099 --> 00:39:45.985
How can you compare a caterpillar with a butterfly?

975
00:39:47.705 --> 00:39:50.440
It will not carry the same emblem.

976
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.543
We have to let go, in order to create a new.

977
00:39:53.543 --> 00:39:57.029
And I feel that that's I was told...

978
00:39:58.482 --> 00:40:01.384
move with the 15%, the 5%,

979
00:40:01.384 --> 00:40:03.252
because it's not always our path

980
00:40:03.252 --> 00:40:04.520
to try and change people,

981
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.455
in fact, we cannot change other people.

982
00:40:06.455 --> 00:40:07.623
We can be light bearers,

983
00:40:07.623 --> 00:40:11.327
we can go ahead, but we have to understand

984
00:40:11.327 --> 00:40:13.496
that it is not for us and our arrogance

985
00:40:13.496 --> 00:40:16.465
to think that we can change other people.

986
00:40:16.465 --> 00:40:17.634
<v Regina>So true.</v>

987
00:40:17.634 --> 00:40:19.135
We can make information available.

988
00:40:19.135 --> 00:40:21.027
<v ->Yes, which is what you do so well.</v>

989
00:40:21.027 --> 00:40:22.754
<v Regina>Oh, well, thank you.</v>

990
00:40:23.707 --> 00:40:25.107
Any final thoughts

991
00:40:25.107 --> 00:40:28.043
about, again, I would encourage people

992
00:40:28.043 --> 00:40:29.311
to pick up a copy of the book,

993
00:40:29.311 --> 00:40:30.547
because we can't get into all

994
00:40:30.547 --> 00:40:33.482
of the really deep cosmic alignments and astrology

995
00:40:33.482 --> 00:40:34.650
and there's so much in there,

996
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.421
but can you maybe just give a little overview

997
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:40.991
of why it's important to understand some of these moments?

998
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:44.228
<v ->I feel that we are not new to the system.</v>

999
00:40:44.228 --> 00:40:47.062
We've been here at other big times before.

1000
00:40:47.062 --> 00:40:49.665
This is at the end of a 26,000-year cycle.

1001
00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:51.368
But hey, we've been here before,

1002
00:40:51.368 --> 00:40:53.569
so I want everybody to recognize their bigness,

1003
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:58.474
their oldness, and we left behind sign posts for ourselves

1004
00:40:58.474 --> 00:41:02.245
in mythology, in alchemy, in astrology.

1005
00:41:02.245 --> 00:41:05.281
We also left a time where we would be,

1006
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:08.185
we would meet certain people who would wake up.

1007
00:41:08.185 --> 00:41:09.386
And one of the things

1008
00:41:09.386 --> 00:41:12.688
I become very interested in is people's mentors.

1009
00:41:12.688 --> 00:41:14.758
And in our childhood, especially,

1010
00:41:14.758 --> 00:41:16.725
we meet up with mentors.

1011
00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:19.361
And those mentors, if we think back,

1012
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:21.096
was specific souls who said,

1013
00:41:21.096 --> 00:41:23.165
"I will be there for you,

1014
00:41:23.165 --> 00:41:25.368
"at that particular age when you were kind of

1015
00:41:25.368 --> 00:41:27.204
"well, should I do this and this?"

1016
00:41:27.204 --> 00:41:29.205
And they'll go, "That way."

1017
00:41:29.205 --> 00:41:30.908
And I would really encourage anybody

1018
00:41:30.908 --> 00:41:32.108
to think back to their mentors,

1019
00:41:32.108 --> 00:41:34.309
especially in the first 20 years of their life, the young,

1020
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:37.680
but even the younger, the grandmother, the neighbor,

1021
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.250
the teacher, because whoever they were,

1022
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.486
what we saw in them is

1023
00:41:43.486 --> 00:41:46.757
what we have the capability of being now.

1024
00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:49.259
They didn't just come in to be our cheerleader.

1025
00:41:49.259 --> 00:41:52.994
They said, "You can be what I am now."

1026
00:41:52.994 --> 00:41:56.932
And it's very important that we remember our mentors.

1027
00:41:56.932 --> 00:41:58.534
Remember the gifts and talents.

1028
00:41:58.534 --> 00:42:01.437
I'm trying to encourage everybody to be unique.

1029
00:42:01.437 --> 00:42:04.640
And we chose so cleverly to have people

1030
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.276
who would turn up in our life at these times,

1031
00:42:07.276 --> 00:42:10.546
so that we would not get lost along the way.

1032
00:42:10.546 --> 00:42:13.616
We also chose people who would give us a hard time.

1033
00:42:13.616 --> 00:42:17.687
And I want to say is that when we pass over

1034
00:42:17.687 --> 00:42:21.291
we will be so amazed by the people who truly loved us.

1035
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:23.327
Because they're not the people we thought.

1036
00:42:23.327 --> 00:42:25.728
They will be the people who said, "I will come down,

1037
00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:26.997
"I will walk beside you,

1038
00:42:26.997 --> 00:42:29.732
"and I will give you the hardest time,

1039
00:42:29.732 --> 00:42:32.735
"because I love you so much, I will not let you stay

1040
00:42:32.735 --> 00:42:36.039
"in that place of the victim for another life,

1041
00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:37.773
"I'll stay small."

1042
00:42:37.773 --> 00:42:39.842
And so I ask everybody who's listening

1043
00:42:39.842 --> 00:42:42.980
is look to the people who have given you the hard time

1044
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.848
and celebrate their presence in your life

1045
00:42:44.848 --> 00:42:46.883
and the love they had for you,

1046
00:42:46.883 --> 00:42:50.052
because through that, you have become who you are.

1047
00:42:50.052 --> 00:42:52.787
And I truly believe this is a time to be big,

1048
00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:54.358
this is a time to be loving,

1049
00:42:54.358 --> 00:42:56.058
this is a time to recognize

1050
00:42:56.058 --> 00:42:58.760
that there's nothing wrong with anybody.

1051
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.930
Only in our minds that we need to stay small.

1052
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.167
This is the time to be unique.

1053
00:43:04.167 --> 00:43:06.235
<v Regina>And there's much more to this story,</v>

1054
00:43:06.235 --> 00:43:08.404
and 2012, The Galactic Center

1055
00:43:08.404 --> 00:43:10.942
and anybody can pick up a copy

1056
00:43:10.942 --> 00:43:11.974
through major book sellers.

1057
00:43:11.974 --> 00:43:12.675
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1058
00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:13.643
<v Regina>Through major book sellers</v>

1059
00:43:13.643 --> 00:43:14.745
and we encourage them to do this

1060
00:43:14.745 --> 00:43:16.813
because it's a very worthwhile, beautiful journey.

1061
00:43:16.813 --> 00:43:18.781
And you can really kind of take it in chunks

1062
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:21.585
and really reflect on pieces at a time.

1063
00:43:21.585 --> 00:43:24.186
And it's a wonderful guide to the times.

1064
00:43:24.186 --> 00:43:25.721
And I've seen a lot of 2012 books.

1065
00:43:25.721 --> 00:43:27.956
But, again, I haven't seen a lot of 2012 books

1066
00:43:27.956 --> 00:43:29.492
written by a woman.

1067
00:43:29.492 --> 00:43:30.794
And so there does seem to be

1068
00:43:30.794 --> 00:43:33.529
a distinctly nurturing quality to it,

1069
00:43:33.529 --> 00:43:35.498
and I very much appreciate that.

1070
00:43:35.498 --> 00:43:36.933
So thank you for the book,

1071
00:43:36.933 --> 00:43:38.167
and thank you again for your time.

1072
00:43:38.167 --> 00:43:40.061
<v ->Thank you so much, thank you.</v>

1073
00:43:41.772 --> 00:43:43.739
<v ->If you're just discovering Christine's work</v>

1074
00:43:43.739 --> 00:43:45.709
for the first time, you may want to take a look

1075
00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:47.410
at our other interviews with her.

1076
00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:50.581
She's a brilliant scientist, doctor and metaphysician.

1077
00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:52.382
You can also pick up a copy of her books

1078
00:43:52.382 --> 00:43:54.584
at Amazon or other major book sellers.

1079
00:43:54.584 --> 00:43:57.387
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
