00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:04.349
<v ->Mark Abadi is a psychologist and a holistic therapist</v>

2
00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:05.756
who looks like a genie

3
00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:07.762
and has studied with many masters.

4
00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.622
His belief is that all of our experiences are connected,

5
00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:12.189
and that we each provide the role of

6
00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.161
holding up mirrors for each other

7
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.687
in our journey through life.

8
00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:18.225
In this human odyssey to remembering who we are

9
00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.169
he says stillness is our path to that awareness.

10
00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.029
Stillness in a very unstill world.

(enchanting music)

12
00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:33.337
<v Voiceover>Using the Mayan Calendar</v>

13
00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:35.747
for your self-expression and definition,

14
00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:39.832
you are a self-existing white wizard,

15
00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:42.626
and you define "in order to enchant,"

16
00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.314
and I'd say that suits you perfectly.

17
00:00:45.314 --> 00:00:47.576
Your ability to communicate, to enchant,

18
00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:49.869
to be able to bring the universe alive for us

19
00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.020
in really practical terms,

20
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.208
you condense for it for us so we can use this information,

21
00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.127
is really astounding,

22
00:00:57.127 --> 00:00:59.527
and what I'd like to do is launch in with you.

23
00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:02.545
You can talk about enchantment, entanglement,

24
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.416
you're a dot connector.
(Mark chuckles)

25
00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:07.732
So let's start where you would begin

26
00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:09.416
a chat with somebody

27
00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:11.070
about how to bring this mystery

28
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.449
into the enchantment of their everyday lives.

29
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.225
I know that's the title of another book, but yes.

30
00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:16.210
<v ->Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.501
It's an interesting one because

32
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:18.823
you start the journey with somebody

33
00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:20.467
wherever they happen to be,

34
00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:23.021
and you can never set it in stone,

35
00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:23.949
and that's the whole thing,

36
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.788
each person's an individual.

37
00:01:25.788 --> 00:01:29.712
But the start is surely awareness.

38
00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:32.529
Awareness of where you are personally,

39
00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.366
awareness of what your limiting bounds are,

40
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.491
and of how you can let go of those limiting bounds.

41
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:40.412
There's a whole myriad of reasons

42
00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:42.864
why we anchor ourselves into this

43
00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:45.605
physical maya that is the world,

44
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.965
and we can, by the same way we anchor ourselves,

45
00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:51.664
we can become aware of those little anchors,

46
00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:54.170
and start to go, "Okay, I don't want that one anymore.

47
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.463
"I just throw it away,"

48
00:01:56.463 --> 00:01:58.522
and then pick that anchor out and throw it away.

49
00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:00.410
But the first step is to become aware

50
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.445
because these anchors,

51
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:03.950
they're not physically tangible like your hand is.

52
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.689
They're more psychological

53
00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.589
and psycho-spiritual.

54
00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:09.508
Now I talk about metaphor a lot,

55
00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:11.182
because you can use metaphor.

56
00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:13.604
For example, take the healers of the world.

57
00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:15.748
Some people, they don't like to call themselves healers.

58
00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:17.405
They call themselves facilitators,

59
00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:18.899
because they don't like, 'cause they're not

60
00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.285
doing the healing,

61
00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:21.822
which is a very common trend

62
00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:23.282
amongst the best of healers.

63
00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:25.480
They talk about getting out of the way.

64
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.966
They talk about they're not the ones

65
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:28.205
actually doing anything,

66
00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:29.581
it's the person themselves,

67
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.369
and they're just providing this sort of catalyst.

68
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.596
Like in a chemical reaction,

69
00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.717
a catalyst doesn't actually get used up.

70
00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:37.872
It just stimulated the reaction of the two,

71
00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:39.729
before and the after product.

72
00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.258
So in the same way, the healers suggest

73
00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:44.353
they're the catalyst, they are the facilitators.

74
00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:46.273
So when they get out of the way,

75
00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:48.939
they allow this kind of channel to happen

76
00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.019
whereby they can reflect to the client

77
00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.715
and they use metaphor.

78
00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.851
For example, a healer or a facilitator might say,

79
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.656
"Yes, my angel guides are behind me."

80
00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:01.333
And another one might say,

81
00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.616
"I've got my grandma behind me."

82
00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.576
Another one might say, "I see this ball of energy

83
00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:09.927
"spinning around inside."

84
00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:14.023
And these are just metaphors for

85
00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:16.284
our minds to get out of the way

86
00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:19.430
and allow that information

87
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.489
to come and rebalance us.

88
00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.822
<v Voiceover>That's an important point you're making</v>

89
00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:24.443
because a lot of times, people who are on

90
00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:25.766
the beginning of their journey

91
00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:28.283
in becoming a healer, for example,

92
00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.811
really get caught up in the specifics

93
00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:34.064
of a given methodology, when in reality

94
00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:36.528
they can pull it out of the hat themselves,

95
00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:38.682
once you understand some of the basic principles

96
00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:39.962
that you're talking about.

97
00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:40.965
<v ->Well exactly.</v>

98
00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.384
I mean, this is how I teach.

99
00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:44.261
I also do teaching massage.

100
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.042
This is how I teach therapy.

101
00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.581
You might teach a technique such as a Swedish massage

102
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:49.925
or a reflexology.

103
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:51.545
You teach the technique, they get the basic technique,

104
00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:53.849
now you say, "Forget everything you've just learned

105
00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.705
"and just go with what you know."

106
00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:56.942
And obviously, you can't forget that

107
00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:58.968
the clarity of knowledge that's gone inside

108
00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:01.241
that becomes the tapotement movement

109
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.043
or the different massage movements,

110
00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:04.249
you can't forget those.

111
00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.422
So then you just incorporate it

112
00:04:05.422 --> 00:04:07.295
into your instinctive flow,

113
00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:10.575
and you end up giving a much more holistic treatment.

114
00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:14.353
So I think it's important to tune in to...

115
00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:15.193
You see, it's difficult.

116
00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:16.579
There's a paradox here,

117
00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.595
as with life, as always with life.

118
00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:20.099
Life is about duality.

119
00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.634
We live in a maya.

120
00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:23.032
The maya is the veil,

121
00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:24.579
this is from the Indians.

122
00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:26.342
They call it the veil, the illusion,

123
00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:28.917
pulled down over your eyes, the maya.

124
00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:30.123
<v Voiceover>It's the light and the dark,</v>

125
00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:31.221
the sweet and the bitter,

126
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.395
the yin and the yang.

127
00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:33.237
<v ->Exactly.</v>

128
00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:34.303
it's all about that,

129
00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:35.142
the up and the down,

130
00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.422
the man and the woman,

131
00:04:36.422 --> 00:04:38.842
and the whole thing is, the magic happens

132
00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:41.308
when we're on neither of those sides.

133
00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:42.749
<v Voiceover>The middle path as the Buddha would say.</v>

134
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:43.827
<v ->The middle path.</v>

135
00:04:43.827 --> 00:04:45.308
The singularity,

136
00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:47.026
which in itself is a paradox.

137
00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:49.468
How can you have not man, not woman?

138
00:04:49.468 --> 00:04:50.508
How can you have it?

139
00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:51.944
Well you might have a hermaphrodite, no.

140
00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:54.345
How can you have not up, not down:

141
00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:55.780
middle.

142
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.082
How can you have not left or not right: middle.

143
00:04:58.082 --> 00:04:59.784
Still doesn't really describe anything.

144
00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:01.520
It's just like this sort of theoretical place

145
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.989
where we would love to be able to conceive

146
00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:05.356
but we really sort of can't.

147
00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:06.591
<v Voiceover>So does it always have to be</v>

148
00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:08.493
a dance of basically rebounding

149
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:11.229
from one point to the other?

150
00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.298
<v ->What I've found is</v>

151
00:05:13.298 --> 00:05:16.067
the more time you remain being still,

152
00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:17.970
the more time you spend in,

153
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.071
not necessarily contemplation,

154
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:23.509
but just in stillness,

155
00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.411
just staying in the moment,

156
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:28.546
and Osho depicted that fantastically.

157
00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:29.813
<v Voiceover>Yes, he did.</v>

158
00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:32.183
<v ->And when you listen to Osho,</v>

159
00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:33.684
he talks

160
00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:35.186
very

161
00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:36.654
slowly.

162
00:05:36.654 --> 00:05:41.654
He says that it is not the words

163
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:46.096
but the spaces in between

164
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.431
that hold the meaning.

165
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.566
<v Voiceover>And even as you do this now,</v>

166
00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:50.468
it is totally entraining.

167
00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:51.301
<v ->Yeah.</v>

168
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:53.071
And haven't we just brought ourselves

169
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.206
into some moment, just now,

170
00:05:55.206 --> 00:05:57.141
which is totally different

171
00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:59.611
from the moment when I was speeding away

172
00:05:59.611 --> 00:06:02.212
in some sort of mental exercise.

173
00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:04.481
But even now in this moment,

174
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:06.951
there's no past, there's no future.

175
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.088
We are just sat here together,

176
00:06:09.088 --> 00:06:12.690
but still my mind is able to generate words somehow,

177
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.525
and this is the thing that Osho did so well.

178
00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:18.095
He managed to stay in the moment

179
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:20.999
and generate things to say.

180
00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:22.868
And this is part of a therapy I've developed,

181
00:06:22.868 --> 00:06:24.502
it's called QMAPing.

182
00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:26.037
<v Voiceover>QMAPing, explain that a little bit more.</v>

183
00:06:26.037 --> 00:06:27.572
<v ->Quantum Mirrored Applied Psychology.</v>

184
00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:28.573
I came up with the acronym

185
00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:30.475
before I came up with the title.

186
00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:31.576
The basic point is

187
00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:33.944
you set yourself a fixed posture with somebody,

188
00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:34.845
eye contact,

189
00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:36.112
you stay with one eye,

190
00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:38.450
and then you mirror them,

191
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.818
and you let them talk to you and speak to you,

192
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:43.387
or you can just stay in the moment.

193
00:06:43.387 --> 00:06:45.890
And the key is to identify the anchors

194
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.259
that we anchor into our physical body

195
00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.861
which help us define what we are

196
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:52.263
and who we are.

197
00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:54.399
And because everything you are

198
00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:57.235
is like a signal, a complex frequency of signals

199
00:06:57.235 --> 00:06:58.736
that get sent out...

200
00:06:58.736 --> 00:06:59.705
(beeping)

201
00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:00.639
<v Voiceover>Your resonant field.</v>

202
00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.472
<v ->Exactly.</v>

203
00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:03.507
You resonate a field or,

204
00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:05.811
if you wanna get really complicated,

205
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:08.013
you resonate a scalar potential

206
00:07:08.013 --> 00:07:09.479
or a torsion field.

207
00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.282
Scalar don't have a field.

208
00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:13.450
They just a have, like temperature.

209
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.351
Temperature doesn't have a field,

210
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.853
it just has temperature readings,

211
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:17.054
and so scalar is the same way

212
00:07:17.054 --> 00:07:18.923
but in the way that a standing wave works,

213
00:07:18.923 --> 00:07:21.258
you can also get information from these scalar

214
00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:23.294
things, potentials.

215
00:07:23.294 --> 00:07:25.598
Anyway, you resonate a set of

216
00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:27.765
individual frequencies

217
00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:29.934
which become a complex combination,

218
00:07:29.934 --> 00:07:31.603
and that gets (inhales)

219
00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:32.970
into the zero point field,

220
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.306
into the quantum vacuum,

221
00:07:34.306 --> 00:07:35.974
into the akashic field.

222
00:07:35.974 --> 00:07:37.242
They're all the same term

223
00:07:37.242 --> 00:07:39.477
to describe this sea of energy that exists everywhere.

224
00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:40.378
<v Voiceover>The plenum.</v>

225
00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:41.413
<v ->The plenum, whatever you wanna call it,</v>

226
00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:42.103
that's Mark Cummings.

227
00:07:42.103 --> 00:07:42.799
Yeah, great.

228
00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:43.213
<v Voiceover>I know, love Mark Cummings.</v>

229
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:43.682
<v ->Yeah.</v>

230
00:07:43.682 --> 00:07:45.350
So the plenum is another way to describe it.

231
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.853
They're all the same thing.

232
00:07:46.853 --> 00:07:48.519
We can have another.

233
00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.654
There was someone else,

234
00:07:49.654 --> 00:07:51.188
Jim calls it the quantum ding dong.

235
00:07:51.188 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Voiceover>(giggles) It doesn't matter what you call it.</v>

236
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.125
<v ->Whatever you call it, it doesn't matter.</v>

237
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.626
The point is you send out

238
00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:57.561
your specific code

239
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.598
into this field,

240
00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:01.166
or (slurps)

241
00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:02.633
it get sucked into this field,

242
00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:05.137
and what comes back is the resonance.

243
00:08:05.137 --> 00:08:06.404
And the resonance that happens

244
00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:07.805
with that specific code

245
00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:09.673
is only you, your resonance,

246
00:08:09.673 --> 00:08:11.876
because you're the one who's coded it.

247
00:08:11.876 --> 00:08:13.077
So you come back.

248
00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:14.212
So you're like, "Who am I?

249
00:08:14.212 --> 00:08:15.479
"I'm me.

250
00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:16.948
"Who am I? I'm me.

251
00:08:16.948 --> 00:08:18.482
"What do I feel about the snake on the floor?

252
00:08:18.482 --> 00:08:20.018
"I'm scared."

253
00:08:20.018 --> 00:08:22.387
But this happens in such a fraction of a second

254
00:08:22.387 --> 00:08:24.288
it seems instantaneous.

255
00:08:24.288 --> 00:08:25.689
It seems like it's in the moment.

256
00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:27.792
<v Voiceover>So every experience of your life</v>

257
00:08:27.792 --> 00:08:29.693
is the reflection of that resonance.

258
00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:30.595
<v ->Well exactly.</v>

259
00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:31.996
And the key is,

260
00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:34.432
if you really wanna apply the changes to your life,

261
00:08:34.432 --> 00:08:36.735
the key is to be still enough

262
00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:40.604
to notice the actual tuning in,

263
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:42.874
the actual remembering that's happening,

264
00:08:42.874 --> 00:08:44.409
the re-membering,

265
00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:45.777
the reconnecting,

266
00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:48.614
becoming a member again of that memory,

267
00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:50.047
remembering it.

268
00:08:50.047 --> 00:08:50.814
Now the thing is,

269
00:08:50.814 --> 00:08:53.350
when we look at Brian Greene's stuff

270
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.687
if you're familiar with his quantum physics,

271
00:08:55.687 --> 00:08:58.790
but the point is when we look at speed,

272
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.593
the faster you go, the slower things move.

273
00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:03.994
Familiar with this concept?

274
00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:05.529
For example, you take a muon

275
00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.600
which is like an electron but 200 times as heavy.

276
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.001
Now their life is something like,

277
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:12.204
oh god, I don't know the figures,

278
00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:16.274
but let's say, for simplicity it's a tenth of a second,

279
00:09:16.274 --> 00:09:19.877
their life, if you accelerate this muon to about

280
00:09:19.877 --> 00:09:22.012
670 million miles an hour,

281
00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:23.647
or if you accelerate it to, say,

282
00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.716
95% the speed of light, or 99,

283
00:09:25.716 --> 00:09:27.853
97% the speed of light, let's say,

284
00:09:27.853 --> 00:09:30.621
then the muon's life

285
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:34.225
becomes about two minutes long.

286
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:36.694
So you've increased its life,

287
00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:40.132
physical life time, by speeding it up.

288
00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:43.801
So the faster you go, the slower you go.

289
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:44.969
<v Voiceover>I see what you're saying.</v>

290
00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:47.271
<v ->Now but the point is</v>

291
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:48.940
this isn't how to extend life

292
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.774
because if we all move that fast,

293
00:09:50.774 --> 00:09:53.544
it's still relative to us, we're moving the same.

294
00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:55.680
We're moving through the galaxy, at the moment,

295
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.648
at whatever million miles an hour,

296
00:09:57.648 --> 00:09:59.951
but it seems like we're still.

297
00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:01.952
So relative to you, it's the same thing.

298
00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:03.487
So if you were to accelerate to,

299
00:10:03.487 --> 00:10:05.590
let's say, the speed of light,

300
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.057
you would still only be able to do

301
00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:09.293
the things that you can do in this lifetime anyway.

302
00:10:09.293 --> 00:10:12.063
So from my perspective, you might live to be 700,

303
00:10:12.063 --> 00:10:14.165
but still you would only be able to make

304
00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:15.366
however many interviews you make

305
00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:17.635
or however many films you make.

306
00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.003
So do you get my point there?

307
00:10:19.003 --> 00:10:19.802
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

308
00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:20.771
<v ->All process is slowed down,</v>

309
00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:21.841
even mental processes.

310
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.676
Now by this rationale, I've gone the other side

311
00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:26.711
So if that's the case,

312
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:29.580
the faster you go, the slower you go.

313
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.748
What about if you go to the other side?

314
00:10:31.748 --> 00:10:33.850
The slower you go,

315
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.054
absolute stillness,

316
00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:40.791
remaining in the moment, absolute stillness.

317
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.894
If you get to absolute stillness,

318
00:10:42.894 --> 00:10:45.194
do you not move so fast

319
00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:47.832
that maybe you're everywhere at once?

320
00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:50.768
Is that maybe what enlightenment is all about?

321
00:10:50.768 --> 00:10:53.537
Being the one thing everywhere.

322
00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:55.107
<v Voiceover>Which is being</v>

323
00:10:55.107 --> 00:10:58.709
an intrinsic part of the quantum field,

324
00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:02.079
or part of the entanglement theory, so to speak,

325
00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:05.349
is all things are entangled, so to speak.

326
00:11:05.349 --> 00:11:06.051
<v ->Yes.</v>

327
00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:07.051
<v Voiceover>We're all things.</v>

328
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.920
All places, all times,

329
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.821
at once.

330
00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:11.920
<v ->We are, but for all intents and purposes,</v>

331
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.194
I'm not this cup.

332
00:11:16.194 --> 00:11:18.496
So your average person,

333
00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:21.199
even the most intelligence of the average people,

334
00:11:21.199 --> 00:11:23.201
or even the most intelligent people say,

335
00:11:23.201 --> 00:11:24.835
"But I'm not this.

336
00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:26.638
"I'm me and I'm not that over there."

337
00:11:26.638 --> 00:11:27.371
And they're right.

338
00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:28.238
They're not,

339
00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:31.209
because they, as an ego or a personality,

340
00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:34.111
will always be separate.

341
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.747
They will always be a separate entity

342
00:11:36.747 --> 00:11:39.085
no matter how still they become,

343
00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:41.552
and this is why the whole paradox

344
00:11:41.552 --> 00:11:43.520
of the journey to enlightenment

345
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.023
is not a journey,

346
00:11:45.023 --> 00:11:47.058
because you can't go anywhere.

347
00:11:47.058 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

348
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.128
And even within the quantum field,

349
00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:53.865
there is still individual signature.

350
00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:54.865
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

351
00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:57.335
<v Voiceover>And this is a point that gets confusing,</v>

352
00:11:57.335 --> 00:11:59.136
I think, when people start looking at themselves

353
00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.538
in a quantum way.

354
00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:02.573
"I am part of the sea of all."

355
00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:05.776
Yes, but you still have your own imprint and signature

356
00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:07.812
within that,

357
00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:11.014
and that's not something for us lose.

358
00:12:11.014 --> 00:12:13.550
We don't want to lose ourselves in that way, do we?

359
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.084
<v ->No.</v>

360
00:12:14.084 --> 00:12:15.219
Well it's kind of like the concept that

361
00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:18.789
maktub, which means it's written,

362
00:12:18.789 --> 00:12:20.824
which means everything's gonna happen

363
00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.226
the way it was always gonna happen,

364
00:12:22.226 --> 00:12:23.394
and that's obvious, it is.

365
00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:24.829
But then you can take that concept and go,

366
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.599
"Right, I'm just gonna sit on my ass and watch,

367
00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:29.400
"watch cricket on TV and eat a bag of chips

368
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.906
"all day."

369
00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.304
You know, you could say that.

370
00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:35.906
Now you might try,

371
00:12:35.906 --> 00:12:38.108
but ultimately, the universe will push you 'round

372
00:12:38.108 --> 00:12:39.644
to being where you should be.

373
00:12:39.644 --> 00:12:41.512
The point is, psychologically,

374
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:43.613
we have to come to some sort of balanced

375
00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:45.716
understanding where we can accept that:

376
00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:48.586
yes, everything's gonna happen the way it's gonna happen.

377
00:12:48.586 --> 00:12:50.186
I was always gonna feel that,

378
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.122
I was always gonna react that way,

379
00:12:52.122 --> 00:12:54.358
but then still I have to take this conecept

380
00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:56.528
of doing something that I really want to do,

381
00:12:56.528 --> 00:12:58.028
doing something good in the world,

382
00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.466
doing something that makes you feel good,

383
00:13:00.466 --> 00:13:02.432
even if you take the concept that

384
00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:05.469
it's already written and you have no decision over it.

385
00:13:05.469 --> 00:13:06.203
<v Voiceover>But that's,</v>

386
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:07.939
which is an interesting concept too

387
00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:09.640
because the decision is

388
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.575
how you choose to plug in, do or not do,

389
00:13:11.575 --> 00:13:13.678
within that context.

390
00:13:13.678 --> 00:13:14.411
<v ->Yeah.</v>

391
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:16.980
But ultimately, in that context, you have no choice.

392
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.950
It's just a domino effect.

393
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.384
You didn't choose where you were born,

394
00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:21.986
you didn't choose who you were born to,

395
00:13:21.986 --> 00:13:23.887
you didn't choose what language you were born into,

396
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.389
you didn't choose your parents or

397
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.324
what friends you parents brought 'round,

398
00:13:27.324 --> 00:13:28.826
you didn't choose any of those influences

399
00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:31.629
that brought you to your first decision,

400
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:32.864
or your first opinion.

401
00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:33.931
<v Voiceover>Your first conscious opinion.</v>

402
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:34.531
<v ->Whatever.</v>

403
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:35.500
You didn't choose any of it,

404
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.100
so you are just a reaction.

405
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.968
Now you take it further back,

406
00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:39.604
your parents didn't choose any of theirs,

407
00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:41.004
or their parents, or their parents.

408
00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:44.041
Everything is a complex fractal reaction,

409
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:46.178
and it gives us the illusion of consciousness.

410
00:13:46.178 --> 00:13:48.679
Now I'm not taking away at all from individuality,

411
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.780
not at all.

412
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.181
You are an individual, there's no one like you,

413
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:53.051
and there never ever can be.

414
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:54.318
<v Voiceover>Right, and what's interesting</v>

415
00:13:54.318 --> 00:13:56.754
is within that concept of you or I

416
00:13:56.754 --> 00:13:58.156
is the ego,

417
00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:00.225
and this is very much misunderstood.

418
00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:03.194
The ego is part of the resonant field of ourselves

419
00:14:03.194 --> 00:14:05.130
that also propels us into

420
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.464
our, whatever our life's endeavor,

421
00:14:07.464 --> 00:14:09.666
whatever we're going to be doing within the world,

422
00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.536
within an incarnation.

423
00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:14.471
And yet, it's the ego that also,

424
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:18.208
when essentially identified with too strongly,

425
00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:20.478
takes us out of that exact flow.

426
00:14:20.478 --> 00:14:22.113
Can you talk about ego from your perspective?

427
00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:22.780
<v ->Yeah.</v>

428
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.113
You see, I think Freud confused the issue

429
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.349
with ego a little bit,

430
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:27.284
because he defined the ego as separate from the id

431
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:29.119
and separate from the super ego.

432
00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.454
When I talk about ego, I'm talking about

433
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:31.855
your personality.

434
00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:32.890
That's everything you are.

435
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.792
You can't function without a personality,

436
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:35.726
you'd be a potato,

437
00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:37.028
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

438
00:14:37.028 --> 00:14:39.230
<v ->and a very watered one as well.</v>

439
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.599
There's a lot of this kind of,

440
00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:45.569
the healers have taken this concept very far

441
00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:47.638
and the hippies, if you like,

442
00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:50.841
and I would totally admit I am a hippie.

443
00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:51.909
I love being a hippie.

444
00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:53.610
I'm a hippie scientist.

445
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.111
<v Voiceover>You're a hippie without hair.</v>

446
00:14:55.111 --> 00:14:56.780
<v ->Yeah. Hippie without hair.</v>

447
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.983
I'm sort of a bald hippie.

448
00:14:58.983 --> 00:14:59.850
(interviewer laughs)

449
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.385
I used to have long hair.

450
00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:02.720
<v Voiceover>I like this.</v>

451
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.854
<v ->I've get a full set of hair,</v>

452
00:15:03.854 --> 00:15:05.021
it's just at home in my cupboard.

453
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:05.856
(interviewer chuckles)

454
00:15:05.856 --> 00:15:10.662
So some healers take this concept a bit far and go,

455
00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:13.497
"Oh, you can't have ego when you're doing this work."

456
00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:16.667
Now I said this to one of my friends, Lionel Milgram,

457
00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:18.436
at the Imperial College in London

458
00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:21.272
whose got a very strong personality,

459
00:15:21.272 --> 00:15:22.640
and I was having a discussion with him

460
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.174
and he started to get upset.

461
00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:26.176
And I said, "Well take your ego out of the equation,

462
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.679
"we're just talking about science here."

463
00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:29.080
And he goes, "You know, Mark,

464
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.681
"sometimes ego is needed

465
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:33.517
"in order to fight this battle that we're fighting."

466
00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:36.087
And even thought it's the art of fighting without fighting,

467
00:15:36.087 --> 00:15:37.954
Bruce Lee, (martial arts utterance)

468
00:15:37.954 --> 00:15:40.013
even though it's the art of fighting without fighting,

469
00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:42.859
it still is a battle that we are gonna need some

470
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.928
strong personalities to bring this forward.

471
00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:46.564
Look at the work I do.

472
00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:49.333
All I do is I take my double Leo,

473
00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:52.336
I take my fire, I take Mayan white wizard--

474
00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:53.670
<v Voiceover>Your belief in enchantment.</v>

475
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.940
<v ->Yeah, I mean enchantment is, what a word.</v>

476
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.574
It just sends tingles down me.

477
00:15:57.574 --> 00:15:59.510
I love to enchant, and who doesn't want to be enchanted

478
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.912
in life, it's what it's about.

479
00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:03.781
There is all the fun is, the maya.

480
00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:05.683
You see, this is where I see this sort of duality

481
00:16:05.683 --> 00:16:07.218
and is separate of the journey.

482
00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:08.519
It's like, I kind of distinguish

483
00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:10.554
two forms of enlightenment.

484
00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:12.255
The one form of enlightenment

485
00:16:12.255 --> 00:16:14.759
is leaving yourself, transcending,

486
00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.028
and connecting to the one thing everywhere.

487
00:16:17.028 --> 00:16:18.561
That means there's no man, no woman,

488
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.197
no Mark anymore.

489
00:16:20.197 --> 00:16:21.498
I am the one thing everywhere.

490
00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:24.067
It's inconceivable because it's a singularity,

491
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.768
and we, being humans,

492
00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:28.471
can only understand things that have edges.

493
00:16:28.471 --> 00:16:29.441
(tapping plastic)

494
00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:32.843
You can't conceive something that doesn't have an edge.

495
00:16:32.843 --> 00:16:33.678
<v Voiceover>Makes total sense</v>

496
00:16:33.678 --> 00:16:35.478
within this scope, unless you are

497
00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:37.147
able to go to that other place.

498
00:16:37.147 --> 00:16:39.250
<v ->Even so, Regina will never be able</v>

499
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.585
to understand something that doesn't have an edge,

500
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:42.922
because her machine,

501
00:16:42.922 --> 00:16:46.323
and she is a part of her machine,

502
00:16:46.323 --> 00:16:48.893
is designed to understand things that have edges,

503
00:16:48.893 --> 00:16:50.894
and as soon as she leaves that machine,

504
00:16:50.894 --> 00:16:52.863
she's no longer her,

505
00:16:52.863 --> 00:16:54.597
she's no longer a woman,

506
00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.400
and then she's no longer a personality.

507
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.768
You just are.

508
00:16:57.768 --> 00:16:58.969
<v Voiceover>Part of, yes.</v>

509
00:16:58.969 --> 00:17:01.205
<v ->Okay so, it's impossible to discuss it,</v>

510
00:17:01.205 --> 00:17:03.339
although we need the personalities

511
00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:04.842
to take us there.

512
00:17:04.842 --> 00:17:06.342
We need the vehicle to walk us

513
00:17:06.342 --> 00:17:07.546
to the edge of the cliff,

514
00:17:07.546 --> 00:17:09.313
kind of all the time enticing the vehicle,

515
00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:10.981
"C'mon. You'll get enlightenment.

516
00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:12.483
"C'mon, c'mon."
(interviewer laughs)

517
00:17:12.483 --> 00:17:14.218
Actually there's no such thing as enlightenment,

518
00:17:14.218 --> 00:17:15.484
jump off the cliff.

519
00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:16.954
And you're like, (fast, short panting)

520
00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:19.089
"I'll turn around, if you don't mind."

521
00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.391
<v Voiceover>That's a stark example of edges, by the way.</v>

522
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:23.027
<v ->Yeah. (both laugh) Okay.</v>

523
00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:25.163
And the second form of enlightenment,

524
00:17:25.163 --> 00:17:28.565
that I like to define, is the ego enlightenment,

525
00:17:28.565 --> 00:17:29.933
the personality enlightenment,

526
00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:34.004
the "I am a zen master, beacon of peace and harmony"

527
00:17:34.004 --> 00:17:35.072
throughout.

528
00:17:35.072 --> 00:17:36.140
Nothing can upset me.

529
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.109
I am love to all creatures.

530
00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:40.545
I enjoy this illusion and this maya,

531
00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:44.414
and I live in abundance of beauty.

532
00:17:44.414 --> 00:17:46.550
That's kind of the second.

533
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.154
Now the first one I talked about encompasses that,

534
00:17:49.154 --> 00:17:51.855
'cause it's everything, and nothing,

535
00:17:51.855 --> 00:17:53.491
it's God.

536
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:56.960
But you see, God can't touch anything,

537
00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.030
and God can't see anything,

538
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.264
for in order to see something

539
00:18:01.264 --> 00:18:02.999
you have to not be it.

540
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.703
You have to have a perspective

541
00:18:04.703 --> 00:18:06.335
from which to observe,

542
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:07.904
and if you have perspective,

543
00:18:07.904 --> 00:18:10.207
you are not somewhere else.

544
00:18:10.207 --> 00:18:11.008
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

545
00:18:11.008 --> 00:18:12.476
<v ->God cannot see anything.</v>

546
00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:15.080
God does not know you exist,

547
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.915
and this is the whole irony with religion,

548
00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:20.150
"God's watching you, God's judging you.

549
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.652
"God says you do this, that and that."

550
00:18:21.652 --> 00:18:22.987
God doesn't care.

551
00:18:22.987 --> 00:18:25.456
To God, good is the same as bad.

552
00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:28.558
There is no duality in God.

553
00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:29.861
There's no opinion.

554
00:18:29.861 --> 00:18:30.628
<v Voiceover>There are no judgments.</v>

555
00:18:30.628 --> 00:18:32.930
It's impossible to judge.

556
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.332
<v ->It's impossible, there's nothing to judge.</v>

557
00:18:35.332 --> 00:18:37.867
There's no where to make the judgment from.

558
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.537
<v Voiceover>You know, let's...</v>

559
00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:41.572
This isn't derailing the conversation.

560
00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:43.308
It's expanding into an area

561
00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:44.375
that I find quite interesting.

562
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:45.276
<v ->Are we on rails?</v>

563
00:18:45.276 --> 00:18:46.811
<v Voiceover>Well no, we're not on rails.</v>

564
00:18:46.811 --> 00:18:47.577
We're not on rails.

565
00:18:47.577 --> 00:18:51.515
This is a free-for-all, okay.

566
00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:56.515
The people, many of us watching this interview, for example,

567
00:18:56.571 --> 00:18:59.824
struggle with the notion of

568
00:18:59.824 --> 00:19:01.092
I am what I am,

569
00:19:01.092 --> 00:19:02.926
as in Rose Paray,

570
00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:04.528
stands up in front of the world,

571
00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:05.597
"I am what I am.

572
00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:08.532
"For everything beautiful and everything that's not,

573
00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:10.767
"I am what I am and I'm perfect in all ways."

574
00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:12.136
There's that.

575
00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:13.770
And then there is the

576
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.307
search for enlightenment

577
00:19:16.307 --> 00:19:18.676
which means a certain amount of mastery

578
00:19:18.676 --> 00:19:21.344
over things we perceive we are not.

579
00:19:21.344 --> 00:19:23.948
For example, having a flash reaction,

580
00:19:23.948 --> 00:19:25.182
anger and so forth,

581
00:19:25.182 --> 00:19:27.217
as in the work of Dawson Church

582
00:19:27.217 --> 00:19:28.585
starting to diffuse those parts.

583
00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.655
You say you do a little bit of this,

584
00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:32.556
it sounds like, in your work with this,

585
00:19:32.556 --> 00:19:35.525
working through with someone and their emotional charge,

586
00:19:35.525 --> 00:19:37.994
with this eye contact and communication,

587
00:19:37.994 --> 00:19:39.197
which I wanna talk about more in a minute.

588
00:19:39.197 --> 00:19:39.830
<v ->Yeah.</v>

589
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.599
<v Voiceover>So how do you perceive this dance</v>

590
00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:43.900
between I am what I am and I'm perfect,

591
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.936
and I really would like to master

592
00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:49.539
this part of myself so I can be more, better.

593
00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:52.176
<v ->Well you mentioned the search for enlightenment there.</v>

594
00:19:52.176 --> 00:19:53.810
The ironic thing is that all humans

595
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.312
have this search for enlightenment,

596
00:19:55.312 --> 00:19:57.914
and the further ironic thing is

597
00:19:57.914 --> 00:19:59.816
that they can never have it.

598
00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:01.885
Just by the virtue of being human,

599
00:20:01.885 --> 00:20:03.254
you cannot have enlightenment.

600
00:20:03.254 --> 00:20:05.021
Now if you're talking about the second form of enlightenment

601
00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:07.826
which is the being a harmonic piece

602
00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:10.427
with the maya, what I,

603
00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:12.529
there's a Greek word called syntonos

604
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:14.197
which is what the company

605
00:20:14.197 --> 00:20:16.334
I've sort of created, it's called Syntonium.

606
00:20:16.334 --> 00:20:18.335
It comes from the Greek word syntonos

607
00:20:18.335 --> 00:20:20.971
which means to be in harmony with your environment.

608
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.640
Now for me, that is that second form of enlightenment,

609
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.575
to be in harmony.

610
00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:26.043
What more could you want?

611
00:20:26.043 --> 00:20:27.678
<v Voiceover>Always a desirable goal.</v>

612
00:20:27.678 --> 00:20:29.247
<v ->Always a desirable goal.</v>

613
00:20:29.247 --> 00:20:30.614
The only thing is that

614
00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:33.284
actually fundamentally underneath us,

615
00:20:33.284 --> 00:20:36.352
I think that we're desiring for the Oneness,

616
00:20:36.352 --> 00:20:39.589
because it seems like

617
00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:41.625
the Oneness or God

618
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:44.428
was sitting around one day

619
00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:48.231
and decided it wanted to experience itself.

620
00:20:48.231 --> 00:20:52.203
So it created a space within itself where it was not.

621
00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:53.804
Now that in a sense is a,

622
00:20:53.804 --> 00:20:56.006
that already is a paradox.

623
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.641
How can you create a space inside yourself

624
00:20:57.641 --> 00:20:58.307
where you're not.

625
00:20:58.307 --> 00:20:59.343
<v Voiceover>Where you're not, yeah.</v>

626
00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:00.511
<v ->But it did,</v>

627
00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:03.013
and thus the universe was born

628
00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.514
in its state of duality.

629
00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:06.850
From the singularity comes the big bang,

630
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.286
or as Bill Nelson calls it, the big suck.

631
00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:11.188
<v Voiceover>Yeah, big suck, right.</v>

632
00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:12.923
(both chuckle)

633
00:21:12.923 --> 00:21:14.224
<v ->Bill.</v>

634
00:21:14.224 --> 00:21:15.825
<v Voiceover>Bill, yes. (chuckles)</v>

635
00:21:15.825 --> 00:21:17.362
<v ->I think Bill's great.</v>

636
00:21:17.362 --> 00:21:19.129
<v Voiceover>And just to explain,</v>

637
00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:21.166
you're talking the SCIO technology.

638
00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.032
<v ->Yes, yeah.</v>

639
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:24.634
Well I'm not just limiting to SCIO technology--

640
00:21:24.634 --> 00:21:25.436
<v Voiceover>But that's how most people</v>

641
00:21:25.436 --> 00:21:26.169
know his name, right?

642
00:21:26.169 --> 00:21:28.972
<v ->SCIO technology, EPFX</v>

643
00:21:28.972 --> 00:21:31.041
or the quantum zero, whatever.

644
00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:32.776
I think Bill Nelson is fantastic,

645
00:21:32.776 --> 00:21:34.679
and I encourage anyone to talk to him

646
00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:36.680
with an open mind, because he's very open,

647
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.448
he'll talk to you, he'll talk to you.

648
00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:40.550
And that's what I like about scientists.

649
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.586
Anyone who can talk to you without saying,

650
00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:44.956
"Uh, I can't, I can't go there, sorry.

651
00:21:44.956 --> 00:21:47.190
"And I can't talk about that."

652
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.991
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

653
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:49.526
<v ->That to me is just...</v>

654
00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:51.528
What's the point in life if you're gonna have that attitude.

655
00:21:51.528 --> 00:21:53.764
So where were we on our rails there?

656
00:21:53.764 --> 00:21:55.465
<v Voiceover>Oh, okay, let's see.</v>

657
00:21:55.465 --> 00:21:57.219
I'm kinda just going on your journey with you.

658
00:21:57.219 --> 00:21:58.436
(chuckles)

659
00:21:58.436 --> 00:21:59.504
<v ->Okay, so I think we were talking about enlightenment.</v>

660
00:21:59.504 --> 00:22:00.637
<v Voiceover>Oh, you were talking about where God,</v>

661
00:22:00.637 --> 00:22:01.539
so where God is not,

662
00:22:01.539 --> 00:22:03.574
and so God creating something where

663
00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:05.376
it was not.

664
00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:07.144
<v ->Yeah okay, so it creates itself.</v>

665
00:22:07.144 --> 00:22:08.345
But I think we were talking about

666
00:22:08.345 --> 00:22:11.481
the trip to enlightenment, the journey.

667
00:22:12.841 --> 00:22:16.721
It is an ironic situation that we find ourselves in

668
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:20.390
where we're searching for this peace and harmony,

669
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.493
but yet the very concept of searching for it

670
00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:26.164
actually limits our ability to find it.

671
00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:27.965
It's like if I was to say to you,

672
00:22:27.965 --> 00:22:29.967
"Think of a face.

673
00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:32.235
"Person, think of a person's face."

674
00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:33.303
Now I'm going to show you

675
00:22:33.303 --> 00:22:34.372
a picture of a million people

676
00:22:34.372 --> 00:22:37.474
and I want you to pick that face out.

677
00:22:37.474 --> 00:22:40.944
Now how do you know what face I want you to pick out?

678
00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:42.913
That's the same journey for enlightenment, you know.

679
00:22:42.913 --> 00:22:44.881
You have a concept of what enlightenment is,

680
00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:47.184
and it's not your fault, you are human.

681
00:22:47.184 --> 00:22:48.786
You have a concept of everything.

682
00:22:48.786 --> 00:22:50.120
If I give you something to think about,

683
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.588
you'll have a concept of it.

684
00:22:51.588 --> 00:22:53.056
That is what humans do.

685
00:22:53.056 --> 00:22:56.526
As a consequence, you will have a concept of enlightenment,

686
00:22:56.526 --> 00:22:58.194
the transcendence,

687
00:22:58.194 --> 00:22:59.630
the thing that you can't have a concept of

688
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.564
you are holding a concept of.

689
00:23:01.564 --> 00:23:04.034
That very holding is the very thing

690
00:23:04.034 --> 00:23:05.835
that limits you from connecting to it,

691
00:23:05.835 --> 00:23:08.472
which is why the Indians, the Vedas,

692
00:23:08.472 --> 00:23:11.708
talk about, "Let it go, let it go."

693
00:23:11.708 --> 00:23:14.545
And this is where the whole concept of yoga is.

694
00:23:14.545 --> 00:23:16.113
You're letting go.

695
00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:18.683
You're practicing letting go.

696
00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:19.684
And this the thing,

697
00:23:19.684 --> 00:23:21.418
and this is where we go back to all the concepts

698
00:23:21.418 --> 00:23:22.886
we talked about, and religion.

699
00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:25.423
When you hold a concept,

700
00:23:25.423 --> 00:23:28.124
you're no longer looking at the other options.

701
00:23:28.124 --> 00:23:29.559
You're just looking at your concept.

702
00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:32.228
You've become, in a way, closed minded

703
00:23:32.228 --> 00:23:33.596
to everything else that's going on,

704
00:23:33.596 --> 00:23:35.465
because you think you've got it,

705
00:23:35.465 --> 00:23:37.267
you think you've got the thing.

706
00:23:37.267 --> 00:23:38.268
<v Voiceover>Which is what the source of,</v>

707
00:23:38.268 --> 00:23:41.235
the source of virtually all conflict.

708
00:23:41.235 --> 00:23:42.205
<v ->Totally.</v>

709
00:23:42.205 --> 00:23:43.373
Yeah the fact that you think you've got it

710
00:23:43.373 --> 00:23:44.708
and they don't.

711
00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:46.310
And either you want to give it them

712
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.980
or you want to confirm that you're right

713
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.716
by showing that they're wrong,

714
00:23:52.716 --> 00:23:54.417
and this is again the duality,

715
00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:55.252
right and wrong.

716
00:23:55.252 --> 00:23:56.453
There is no right and wrong.

717
00:23:56.453 --> 00:23:57.888
There just is.

718
00:23:57.888 --> 00:23:59.223
There just is the moment,

719
00:23:59.223 --> 00:24:01.058
and when we take this into our heart...

720
00:24:01.058 --> 00:24:02.994
You see, if you practice on stillness,

721
00:24:02.994 --> 00:24:06.397
you ask me how you could apply this.

722
00:24:06.397 --> 00:24:08.933
If you practice on stillness,

723
00:24:08.933 --> 00:24:10.767
on being in the moment,

724
00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:14.003
then you're able to

725
00:24:14.003 --> 00:24:17.875
have that ability to let go

726
00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:21.244
of the past and the future,

727
00:24:21.244 --> 00:24:23.579
that Osho moment,

728
00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:26.250
that Ramesh Belsekar.

729
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.887
That, "Everything is okay, it is just in the moment."

730
00:24:29.887 --> 00:24:32.189
If you practice on being still,

731
00:24:32.189 --> 00:24:33.791
meditating on stillness--

732
00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:34.825
<v Voiceover>Breath.</v>

733
00:24:34.825 --> 00:24:36.760
<v ->Breath, yeah.
<v Voiceover>One way to go.</v>

734
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.396
<v ->Breath's a fundamental vehicle</v>

735
00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:40.231
from which we go,

736
00:24:40.231 --> 00:24:42.131
and those people who are not being still

737
00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:44.401
are the people who are holding their breath.

738
00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:46.804
And you see them all the time, the anxious ones,

739
00:24:46.804 --> 00:24:49.205
and you notice when they talk to you

740
00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:50.006
and you're talking to them,

741
00:24:50.006 --> 00:24:51.475
and maybe you've interviewed some peoeple

742
00:24:51.475 --> 00:24:52.875
who, as you're talking to them,

743
00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:57.875
you'll see when you ask them a question, they'll go...

744
00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:59.983
And then they'll start talking.

745
00:24:59.983 --> 00:25:01.551
And what they've done is they're holding their breath,

746
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.420
they're closing off their solar plexus chakra,

747
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.188
they're stressing the adrenal glands,

748
00:25:05.188 --> 00:25:07.023
releasing adrenaline into the body

749
00:25:07.023 --> 00:25:08.625
and they're getting excited.

750
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.994
This is what happens,

751
00:25:09.994 --> 00:25:12.362
they're moving faster, they're not moving slower.

752
00:25:12.362 --> 00:25:15.165
The concept is to move as slow as you can.

753
00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:18.468
The concept is to be as still as you can,

754
00:25:18.468 --> 00:25:21.404
thus you become faster.

755
00:25:21.404 --> 00:25:24.040
Constantly, the mind is trying to move.

756
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.076
That's what it's designed to do,

757
00:25:26.076 --> 00:25:27.377
sorry, the brain.

758
00:25:27.377 --> 00:25:29.079
You don't wanna stop the brain from functioning

759
00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:30.748
because you'd be dead.

760
00:25:30.748 --> 00:25:32.650
So the brain is our vehicle to

761
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.385
manifest the understanding of duality.

762
00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:36.886
Fine.

763
00:25:36.886 --> 00:25:38.822
Being still is something very few of us

764
00:25:38.822 --> 00:25:41.591
can ever know we've ever done.

765
00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:43.194
Some people do it instinctively without even trying.

766
00:25:43.194 --> 00:25:45.595
Most people don't, I was never still.

767
00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:48.199
So when you mediate on stillness,

768
00:25:48.199 --> 00:25:50.767
i.e. when you sit

769
00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:53.471
and you remain still

770
00:25:53.471 --> 00:25:55.555
and you breath...

771
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.481
and you exercise the muscle of the moment...

772
00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:06.149
I quite like that: muscle of the moment.

773
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:08.118
When you exercise the muscle of the moment,

774
00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:10.687
you start to realize that underneath

775
00:26:10.687 --> 00:26:13.523
all this maya,

776
00:26:13.523 --> 00:26:16.826
underneath all this painting

777
00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:19.629
there is a canvas,

778
00:26:19.629 --> 00:26:22.366
and it doesn't matter whether you like the picture,

779
00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:24.501
whether the picture makes you feel good,

780
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:25.736
or whether the picture makes you feel,

781
00:26:25.736 --> 00:26:26.936
"Ugh. I don't like that picture,"

782
00:26:26.936 --> 00:26:29.072
or, "Oh God, that's evil, that picture."

783
00:26:29.072 --> 00:26:31.509
Whatever the picture makes you feel,

784
00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:33.777
it is only a picture.

785
00:26:33.777 --> 00:26:35.746
Now that's great for a philosophical concept,

786
00:26:35.746 --> 00:26:37.914
but the more you meditate,

787
00:26:37.914 --> 00:26:40.850
the more you realize that

788
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.552
as an actuality.

789
00:26:42.552 --> 00:26:44.554
Now I'm not talking about a theoretical concept here,

790
00:26:44.554 --> 00:26:46.123
I'm not talking about philosophy,

791
00:26:46.123 --> 00:26:48.559
I"m not talking about a belief.

792
00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:51.995
I'm talking about a realization.

793
00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:54.231
Now a realization can't be boxed,

794
00:26:54.231 --> 00:26:56.266
and you can't give someone a realization.

795
00:26:56.266 --> 00:26:58.501
You can only have it.

796
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:01.338
And when you have your first realization,

797
00:27:01.338 --> 00:27:02.171
and many people think,

798
00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:03.506
"I've had realizations,"

799
00:27:03.506 --> 00:27:05.342
but when you have your first realization,

800
00:27:05.342 --> 00:27:06.909
you'll realize that nothing you've had before

801
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:08.412
was a realization.

802
00:27:08.412 --> 00:27:11.648
Anyway, the more you meditate on the stillness,

803
00:27:11.648 --> 00:27:14.919
the more you recognize that this is all a painting

804
00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:17.487
and that there's a canvas underneath it,

805
00:27:17.487 --> 00:27:21.090
and as soon as you realize that there's a canvas,

806
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.861
everything becomes okay.

807
00:27:23.861 --> 00:27:25.661
Everything is okay,

808
00:27:25.661 --> 00:27:28.599
because it's all just a painting.

809
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:31.334
And then you realize that the canvas

810
00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:34.003
is sitting on something,

811
00:27:34.003 --> 00:27:37.640
and you go like that with the corner of the canvas.

812
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.608
"Wow.

813
00:27:38.608 --> 00:27:39.711
"So you mean the reason why that

814
00:27:39.711 --> 00:27:41.877
"painting has happened like that,"

815
00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:43.846
"and there's a bump in the paint,

816
00:27:43.846 --> 00:27:46.349
"is because there's a bump underneath it.

817
00:27:46.349 --> 00:27:51.020
"Wow, but that bump isn't part of this maya."

818
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.758
And then you go deeper into the onion shells of the maya,

819
00:27:54.758 --> 00:27:57.026
because the canvas is still the maya

820
00:27:57.026 --> 00:27:59.730
and the table it sits on is still the maya.

821
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.831
It's still the illusion but it's not

822
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:03.066
the illusion we see here.

823
00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:04.968
It's the illusion that healers go into,

824
00:28:04.968 --> 00:28:06.869
it's the illusion that psychics go into,

825
00:28:06.869 --> 00:28:10.006
it's the illusion that past life regressors go into,

826
00:28:10.006 --> 00:28:11.708
where they go into these edges of the maya.

827
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:14.811
Imagine the human here with circles around him,

828
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:17.280
lots of circles, say 10 for argument's sake,

829
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.449
10 circles.

830
00:28:18.449 --> 00:28:19.949
I mean, the very concept that we're making circles

831
00:28:19.949 --> 00:28:21.451
is irrelevant, because they're all

832
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:22.853
folded in and out on themselves,

833
00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:24.086
don't worry about it.

834
00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:26.990
So the first shell might be where our mental body sits.

835
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.859
The second shell, where our emotional body sits.

836
00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:30.827
Some people like it the other way, I don't care.

837
00:28:30.827 --> 00:28:33.329
They're just not here though,

838
00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:34.864
but they inform here.

839
00:28:34.864 --> 00:28:36.298
They're like the matrix.

840
00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:37.433
You know The Matrix, the film?

841
00:28:37.433 --> 00:28:38.301
It's great, great movie.

842
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:39.002
<v Voiceover>I was just going to bring that up,</v>

843
00:28:39.002 --> 00:28:39.937
as a matter of fact.

844
00:28:39.937 --> 00:28:42.639
<v ->It's a great movie, what a coincidence.</v>

845
00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:44.307
This is called entrainment, what we're doing now.

846
00:28:44.307 --> 00:28:45.308
<v Voiceover>Right. Exactly.</v>

847
00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:46.276
<v ->So the matrix is,</v>

848
00:28:46.276 --> 00:28:47.677
and that's exactly how it is,

849
00:28:47.677 --> 00:28:49.679
except without the big baddy on the other side.

850
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.781
On the other side it's just you,

851
00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:54.051
and it's not as easy as taking a pill,

852
00:28:54.051 --> 00:28:55.184
but the concepts are there.

853
00:28:55.184 --> 00:28:56.386
It's all metaphor,

854
00:28:56.386 --> 00:28:57.587
and again this is coming back to the

855
00:28:57.587 --> 00:28:59.455
metaphoric understanding,

856
00:28:59.455 --> 00:29:02.392
because as a human, we have to hold metaphors

857
00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:03.926
to take us somewhere

858
00:29:03.926 --> 00:29:06.796
where we can let go of those metaphors.

859
00:29:06.796 --> 00:29:07.530
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, and</v>

860
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.832
there's another little book out,

861
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:12.869
Don Miguel Ruiz's most recent, The Voice of Knowledge,

862
00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:15.838
which also speaks to this notion of the canvas,

863
00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:17.741
and speaks to the reality that

864
00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:19.508
you are nothing but a secondary character

865
00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:21.811
in anyone else's life but your own.

866
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:24.313
<v ->Sure, I mean I would even go further than that.</v>

867
00:29:24.313 --> 00:29:26.382
<v Voiceover>Yes, but it's very simply put.</v>

868
00:29:26.382 --> 00:29:27.350
For anyone listening, I think it's a

869
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.520
lovely place to go to realize that it is all perception,

870
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.890
it's your canvas, it's his canvas, her canvas.

871
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.059
<v ->We say in England, "Horses for courses."</v>

872
00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:36.892
<v Voiceover>What's the mean?</v>

873
00:29:36.892 --> 00:29:38.562
<v ->Well exactly, nobody seems to know what it means.</v>

874
00:29:38.562 --> 00:29:39.462
<v Voiceover>I know, I'm married to a Brit</v>

875
00:29:39.462 --> 00:29:40.963
and I don't know what it means. (chuckles)

876
00:29:40.963 --> 00:29:42.465
<v ->I'm sure he knows what it means.</v>

877
00:29:42.465 --> 00:29:45.368
Horses for courses means each to their own.

878
00:29:45.368 --> 00:29:46.068
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

879
00:29:46.068 --> 00:29:48.804
<v ->So it basically comes from, it's a racing term.</v>

880
00:29:48.804 --> 00:29:50.608
So one horse would do well on one type track,

881
00:29:50.608 --> 00:29:53.242
but it would do badly on another type of track,

882
00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:55.311
horses for courses.

883
00:29:55.311 --> 00:29:57.147
I kinda like it, horses for courses.

884
00:29:57.147 --> 00:30:00.116
So each person's journey is their own,

885
00:30:00.116 --> 00:30:01.485
and they must own it,

886
00:30:01.485 --> 00:30:03.052
and they must realize

887
00:30:03.052 --> 00:30:04.821
that they don't actually have to

888
00:30:04.821 --> 00:30:06.557
do anything,

889
00:30:06.557 --> 00:30:08.258
and that's the real secret.

890
00:30:08.258 --> 00:30:09.925
People talk about, "Oh, the secret.

891
00:30:09.925 --> 00:30:11.728
"Oh the secret, the law of attraction."

892
00:30:11.728 --> 00:30:13.063
There's no law of attraction.

893
00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:14.264
There's no such thing.

894
00:30:14.264 --> 00:30:16.232
There is no such thing as the law of attraction.

895
00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:19.436
There might be a law of effect...

896
00:30:19.436 --> 00:30:20.870
<v Voiceover>But there's a lot of resonance.</v>

897
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.137
<v ->There is a lot of a resonance,</v>

898
00:30:22.137 --> 00:30:23.907
that's what she was trying to argue with me today,

899
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:25.641
there is a law of resonance,

900
00:30:25.641 --> 00:30:26.742
but there is also a law,

901
00:30:26.742 --> 00:30:30.313
the law of resonance that can destruct things,

902
00:30:30.313 --> 00:30:32.048
or it can construct things.

903
00:30:32.048 --> 00:30:33.917
So it's always making things bigger.

904
00:30:33.917 --> 00:30:36.653
So if I was to, for example, bounce a ball

905
00:30:36.653 --> 00:30:38.555
here and I had a machine

906
00:30:38.555 --> 00:30:39.322
that did exactly the same,

907
00:30:39.322 --> 00:30:41.024
and I was to will that ball, "Come towards me.

908
00:30:41.024 --> 00:30:42.358
"Come towards me, come towards me,"

909
00:30:42.358 --> 00:30:43.993
70% of the time it would

910
00:30:43.993 --> 00:30:45.995
and 30% of the time it wouldn't.

911
00:30:45.995 --> 00:30:47.296
This is the same when we have

912
00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.832
a random event, a random number generator

913
00:30:49.832 --> 00:30:51.400
and we get a group of people and we say,

914
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.036
"Make that random number generator

915
00:30:53.036 --> 00:30:55.905
"click every six seconds instead of every 10 seconds."

916
00:30:55.905 --> 00:30:58.508
<v Voiceover>Yes, but it's fair enough,</v>

917
00:30:58.508 --> 00:31:00.776
just to strip it to basics, it's fair enough to say

918
00:31:00.776 --> 00:31:04.114
that everything operates off of resonance, right?

919
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:04.581
<v ->Yes.</v>

920
00:31:04.581 --> 00:31:06.115
<v Voiceover>So, what's you're resonating out</v>

921
00:31:06.115 --> 00:31:08.651
is pretty much a mirror, you're going to get it back.

922
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:09.852
<v ->You see, I would disagree.</v>

923
00:31:09.852 --> 00:31:10.687
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

924
00:31:10.687 --> 00:31:11.455
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

925
00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:12.522
<v ->I would say, you know,</v>

926
00:31:12.522 --> 00:31:14.991
this is the point, this is why it's not a law.

927
00:31:14.991 --> 00:31:17.560
Now if it happened 100% of the time, it would be a law.

928
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.397
The reason why I don't like The Secret's law,

929
00:31:20.397 --> 00:31:21.698
is because it's not a law.

930
00:31:21.698 --> 00:31:23.499
There is a law of effect.

931
00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:24.868
You affect the world,

932
00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:27.437
you can resonate things out, but because, don't forget,

933
00:31:27.437 --> 00:31:30.007
it's a complex fractal pattern you're resonating out.

934
00:31:30.007 --> 00:31:32.408
It's not just one wave going woo,

935
00:31:32.408 --> 00:31:34.844
it's a billion waves every second,

936
00:31:34.844 --> 00:31:36.279
going (makes swishing effect)

937
00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:38.648
and there's a billion other waves going intersecting with it

938
00:31:38.648 --> 00:31:40.349
and creating other standing waves.

939
00:31:40.349 --> 00:31:42.252
If we could see these, we would just be

940
00:31:42.252 --> 00:31:44.855
like this in the world.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

941
00:31:44.855 --> 00:31:47.757
<v ->Wow, (laughs) oh my God.</v>

942
00:31:47.757 --> 00:31:49.158
Like tripping on acid or something.

943
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:50.459
<v Voiceover>When you slip out of your body</v>

944
00:31:50.459 --> 00:31:53.898
for a little bit, you see all kinds of crazy plaid. (laughs)

945
00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:56.738
<v ->Exactly, and that's not even close to the amount (mumbles)</v>

946
00:31:56.738 --> 00:31:58.701
So the point is, it's very complex,

947
00:31:58.701 --> 00:32:00.370
and it's fractal harmonic.

948
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.207
You might think that you need this,

949
00:32:04.207 --> 00:32:06.709
but the universe might provide you with something else.

950
00:32:06.709 --> 00:32:08.945
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, and I don't know,</v>

951
00:32:08.945 --> 00:32:11.114
and you're saying for that very reason,

952
00:32:11.114 --> 00:32:12.850
is why you can't apply any sort of law,

953
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.751
because you're putting out one thing,

954
00:32:14.751 --> 00:32:19.421
and it is, I think, a benevolent, life is benevolent.

955
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:22.425
You do get what you need, if not what you want.

956
00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:23.794
<v ->You always get what you need.</v>

957
00:32:23.794 --> 00:32:25.361
<v Voiceover>But that is still part of,</v>

958
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:27.963
in my view, it's still part of a resonance.

959
00:32:27.963 --> 00:32:29.467
<v ->Yeah, but you might need to die.</v>

960
00:32:29.467 --> 00:32:30.400
<v Voiceover>That's true.</v>

961
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.534
<v ->You might need to lose your leg.</v>

962
00:32:31.534 --> 00:32:32.635
<v Voiceover>That's true.</v>

963
00:32:32.635 --> 00:32:34.703
<v ->You might need to be in excruciating pain.</v>

964
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:36.306
<v Voiceover>That's still part of the resonance.</v>

965
00:32:36.306 --> 00:32:37.540
<v ->It's totally part of the resonance,</v>

966
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.909
but it's not part of the law of attraction is it?

967
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:40.943
Cause that person who's in total--

968
00:32:40.943 --> 00:32:42.311
<v Voiceover>Yes it is, it's just not the law</v>

969
00:32:42.311 --> 00:32:45.815
who you might necessarily prefer that it show itself to you.

970
00:32:45.815 --> 00:32:48.017
<v ->Okay, okay, so let's take it a bit further.</v>

971
00:32:48.017 --> 00:32:50.419
There might well be a law of attraction,

972
00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:53.090
but it's not under your control in any way.

973
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.356
<v Voiceover>Yes, because it's driven</v>

974
00:32:54.356 --> 00:32:56.893
by so many subconscious motivations as well.

975
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:59.094
<v ->Well God, and all the other interactions in the world.</v>

976
00:32:59.094 --> 00:33:00.197
<v Voiceover>And everything else, exactly.</v>

977
00:33:00.197 --> 00:33:02.999
<v ->What color that man a mile away,</v>

978
00:33:02.999 --> 00:33:05.902
what color pants he's wearing, is affecting me.

979
00:33:05.902 --> 00:33:08.871
When you imagine that, and the myriad

980
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:10.606
of other billion things that's going on.

981
00:33:10.606 --> 00:33:12.575
<v Voiceover>No, it's very complex, but I wanted to</v>

982
00:33:12.575 --> 00:33:15.945
just reduce it to a simplicity, which is the resonance.

983
00:33:15.945 --> 00:33:17.114
<v ->Sure, so the point is,</v>

984
00:33:17.114 --> 00:33:18.681
to agree with The Secret in one way,

985
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:22.452
there is a, I would call it a law of effect.

986
00:33:22.452 --> 00:33:23.854
Other people would disagree with me and say

987
00:33:23.854 --> 00:33:25.487
it's just a phenomenon of effect.

988
00:33:25.487 --> 00:33:27.190
Anyway, I like it, it's a law of effect.

989
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.726
So the point is your thoughts can affect reality.

990
00:33:29.726 --> 00:33:32.062
There is no doubt, your thoughts affect reality.

991
00:33:32.062 --> 00:33:35.198
This is why, in science, we have double controlled,

992
00:33:35.198 --> 00:33:38.168
clinical controlled trials, double blind controlled trials.

993
00:33:38.168 --> 00:33:39.569
Because they know that the experimenter

994
00:33:39.569 --> 00:33:41.904
doing the operations, if they believe in the experiment,

995
00:33:41.904 --> 00:33:43.773
they'll get positive results.

996
00:33:43.773 --> 00:33:45.108
And if they don't believe in the experiment,

997
00:33:45.108 --> 00:33:46.542
they'll get negative results.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

998
00:33:46.542 --> 00:33:48.778
<v ->Not through because they're being dishonest,</v>

999
00:33:48.778 --> 00:33:51.114
but just because they are affecting the results

1000
00:33:51.114 --> 00:33:52.849
of the experiment.
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

1001
00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:57.086
<v ->So, I wouldn't say it's a law, but there is an effect.</v>

1002
00:33:57.086 --> 00:33:59.522
So by that rational, everyone should be as positiive

1003
00:33:59.522 --> 00:34:03.026
as they can, and invisage their world, and conjure it.

1004
00:34:03.026 --> 00:34:05.996
Conjure their world, because they can manifest it.

1005
00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:08.431
They can, and things manifest in your world

1006
00:34:08.431 --> 00:34:10.333
exactly how they were supposed to be.

1007
00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:11.533
This is a concept I say to people,

1008
00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:14.002
people say "I wish I hadn't done that,

1009
00:34:14.002 --> 00:34:15.304
"I wasn't supposed to do that."

1010
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:16.940
I say "You weren't supposed to do it?"

1011
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.940
Everything you do, and everything that happens

1012
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.378
is supposed to happen, otherwise it wouldn't happen.

1013
00:34:22.378 --> 00:34:24.045
It's very simple.

1014
00:34:24.045 --> 00:34:27.317
How could something that wasn't supposed to happen, happen?

1015
00:34:27.317 --> 00:34:29.120
In itself is a paradox.

1016
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.920
<v Voiceover>You don't believe in choosing points?</v>

1017
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.255
<v ->Well, yeah, but the points you choose,</v>

1018
00:34:32.255 --> 00:34:33.789
you were always gonna choose.

1019
00:34:33.789 --> 00:34:35.159
<v Voiceover>You think?</v>

1020
00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.460
<v ->Well, think about it, you're the reaction.</v>

1021
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.261
Where were you born?

1022
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:41.429
<v Voiceover>But do you have to live within that reaction?</v>

1023
00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:43.233
All the time, can't you break the reaction?

1024
00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:44.034
<v ->Break what?</v>

1025
00:34:44.034 --> 00:34:48.237
How can you use the canvas and the paintbrush,

1026
00:34:48.237 --> 00:34:51.074
to draw yourself off the canvas and the paintbrush?

1027
00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:54.911
How can you use the pen to stop drawing?

1028
00:34:54.911 --> 00:34:55.777
You are it.

1029
00:34:55.777 --> 00:34:57.748
<v Voiceover>Let's again, reduce it to something simple.</v>

1030
00:34:57.748 --> 00:35:00.383
You're patterned into a choice point,

1031
00:35:00.383 --> 00:35:02.085
your neuropathways have been developed

1032
00:35:02.085 --> 00:35:03.753
to have a certain reaction in life.

1033
00:35:03.753 --> 00:35:05.187
<v ->Of course, I'm not saying it's limited to neurons,</v>

1034
00:35:05.187 --> 00:35:06.656
but okay, everything you are.

1035
00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:08.490
<v Voiceover>I'm reducing it, just to reduce it that</v>

1036
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:12.196
we're habitual beings, we have been patterned by

1037
00:35:12.196 --> 00:35:15.199
I don't mean DNA genetics, but I mean

1038
00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:16.933
everything that has come before us.

1039
00:35:16.933 --> 00:35:18.567
<v ->Everything, environment and our genetics,</v>

1040
00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:19.736
everything and spirit.

1041
00:35:19.736 --> 00:35:22.539
<v Voiceover>But isn't there always the possibility</v>

1042
00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:25.941
that you can say "I choose to be still this moment

1043
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:27.510
"and not choose that this time."

1044
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.144
<v ->You see, this is where the paradox comes in.</v>

1045
00:35:29.144 --> 00:35:32.615
You have no choice in anything,

1046
00:35:32.615 --> 00:35:34.884
but saying that to someone doesn't help them,

1047
00:35:34.884 --> 00:35:36.885
because it seems like we have choice.

1048
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:40.190
Mark would certainly like to think he has choice.

1049
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.391
Mark is just a reaction, okay.

1050
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:44.227
There's a circular argument, because it doesn't really

1051
00:35:44.227 --> 00:35:45.728
go anywhere, it doesn't help anyone.

1052
00:35:45.728 --> 00:35:48.030
Fine, okay, so if I'm just always gonna do

1053
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.566
what I was gonna do, I'll just sit on the couch

1054
00:35:49.566 --> 00:35:51.067
and eat my chips.

1055
00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:52.734
And not do anything.

1056
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:54.837
Okay, well then you were supposed to do that.

1057
00:35:54.837 --> 00:35:59.108
It's kind of like, it's nice for people to feel empowered,

1058
00:35:59.108 --> 00:36:01.110
but the empowerment is a metaphor for them

1059
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.515
to deal with the reaction that's happening anyway.

1060
00:36:04.515 --> 00:36:06.815
The world is unfolding, and your position in the world

1061
00:36:06.815 --> 00:36:08.318
is always gonna be that.

1062
00:36:08.318 --> 00:36:10.219
You were always gonna sit there.

1063
00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:11.853
Nothing that was ever gonna happen in the universe

1064
00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:13.923
was ever gonna stop you from sitting there and talking to me

1065
00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:15.459
right now at this place.

1066
00:36:15.459 --> 00:36:17.527
With your husband stood behind the camera.

1067
00:36:17.527 --> 00:36:19.196
That was always gonna happen,

1068
00:36:19.196 --> 00:36:20.197
and you were always going to be playing

1069
00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:22.465
with the top of your pen just like you are with your thumb.

1070
00:36:22.465 --> 00:36:24.266
That was always going to happen.

1071
00:36:24.266 --> 00:36:27.103
Nothing you could've done would ever had diverted you

1072
00:36:27.103 --> 00:36:28.371
from this moment.

1073
00:36:28.371 --> 00:36:29.705
<v Voiceover>I would agree with that.</v>

1074
00:36:29.705 --> 00:36:32.875
<v ->So everything is maktub, everything's written.</v>

1075
00:36:32.875 --> 00:36:34.376
I would recommend The Alchemist

1076
00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:35.344
for any of your listeners.

1077
00:36:35.344 --> 00:36:36.478
<v Voiceover>It's a wonderful book.</v>

1078
00:36:36.478 --> 00:36:37.313
<v ->So beautiful.</v>

1079
00:36:37.313 --> 00:36:38.514
<v Voiceover>It's so simple and so beautiful.</v>

1080
00:36:38.514 --> 00:36:39.782
<v ->Easy.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1081
00:36:39.782 --> 00:36:43.318
<v ->He's a great writer, but The Alchemist is his best book.</v>

1082
00:36:43.318 --> 00:36:44.654
<v Voiceover>Okay, so let's take it now</v>

1083
00:36:44.654 --> 00:36:46.456
and ground it into practical terms.

1084
00:36:46.456 --> 00:36:49.325
So now we need to learn to be still as a people.

1085
00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:50.360
<v ->Okay.
<v Voiceover>All people.</v>

1086
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.026
<v ->Yes.</v>

1087
00:36:51.026 --> 00:36:52.162
<v Voiceover>We need to learn to be still.</v>

1088
00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:55.132
And I love your references to Osho,

1089
00:36:55.132 --> 00:36:56.833
I think that's a beautiful place to begin,

1090
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:59.068
no matter what anybody thinks about

1091
00:36:59.068 --> 00:37:01.470
the rest of the story around Osho.

1092
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.805
What a beautiful being.

1093
00:37:02.805 --> 00:37:05.107
<v ->Oh yeah, I mean forget the Cashram now,</v>

1094
00:37:05.107 --> 00:37:06.142
as we all called it.

1095
00:37:06.142 --> 00:37:07.343
<v Voiceover>Cashram, exactly.</v>

1096
00:37:07.343 --> 00:37:09.079
<v ->Forget the Cashram.</v>

1097
00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:11.414
<v Voiceover>Beautiful, beautiful, wise work.</v>

1098
00:37:11.414 --> 00:37:12.849
<v ->Yeah, listen to his words,</v>

1099
00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:14.416
that's my recommendation to your listeners.

1100
00:37:14.416 --> 00:37:15.485
Listen to his words.

1101
00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:17.620
You can read him if you want, but listen to him

1102
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.488
is where all the power lies.

1103
00:37:19.488 --> 00:37:21.591
So, the first step I would say,

1104
00:37:21.591 --> 00:37:23.159
if we want to be still as a people,

1105
00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:25.294
is first be still with yourself.

1106
00:37:25.294 --> 00:37:28.231
Because the more time you spend being still,

1107
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:32.068
the more you notice that everything is just a painting,

1108
00:37:32.068 --> 00:37:34.236
and everything is just a reaction.

1109
00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:38.975
In noticing that, suddenly, instead of exploding,

1110
00:37:38.975 --> 00:37:42.879
you kinda go "Now, I've got the urge to explode."

1111
00:37:42.879 --> 00:37:44.581
"Okay, I'm gonna do it!" Explode.

1112
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:47.016
Now the next time after you've meditated for a little bit,

1113
00:37:47.016 --> 00:37:49.250
you go "alright, I've got the urge to explode,

1114
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.954
"maybe I won't, maybe I'll just smile instead."

1115
00:37:51.954 --> 00:37:56.325
Maybe I'll know that I have this boiling urge

1116
00:37:56.325 --> 00:37:58.528
to explode inside myself, and I know that

1117
00:37:58.528 --> 00:38:00.763
that person there has conjured it in me,

1118
00:38:00.763 --> 00:38:05.000
but I am gonna accept that process has just happened,

1119
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.937
and I'm gonna smile.

1120
00:38:06.937 --> 00:38:11.607
In doing so, I have now transcended my habitual responses

1121
00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:13.342
and my limited belief.

1122
00:38:13.342 --> 00:38:14.009
<v Voiceover>Kinda what we're talking about</v>

1123
00:38:14.009 --> 00:38:14.977
a minute ago, yes.

1124
00:38:14.977 --> 00:38:16.578
<v ->Yeah, have you ever had an emotion?</v>

1125
00:38:16.578 --> 00:38:17.648
<v Voiceover>Never!</v>

1126
00:38:17.648 --> 00:38:19.382
<v ->Have you ever been had by an emotion?</v>

1127
00:38:19.382 --> 00:38:20.551
<v Voiceover>Oh yes.</v>

1128
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:22.951
<v ->That's the point, most people are being had my emotions.</v>

1129
00:38:22.951 --> 00:38:23.786
<v Voiceover>That's true.</v>

1130
00:38:23.786 --> 00:38:24.654
<v ->You want to have an emotion?</v>

1131
00:38:24.654 --> 00:38:26.923
That's fine, I'm not talking about being a robot.

1132
00:38:26.923 --> 00:38:29.591
I am talking about being aware of where that happens,

1133
00:38:29.591 --> 00:38:32.695
and in a sense, being able to be the gatekeeper

1134
00:38:32.695 --> 00:38:34.630
to your own emotions.

1135
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.534
Because, what's your goal in life?

1136
00:38:38.534 --> 00:38:39.435
What's your aim?

1137
00:38:39.435 --> 00:38:43.806
Most people's aim is to do good in the world.

1138
00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:46.309
Even Hitler thought he was doing good in the world.

1139
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:49.212
He thought he was doing a service to humanity.

1140
00:38:49.212 --> 00:38:54.212
Now, as slightly delusional as that might be,

1141
00:38:54.517 --> 00:38:57.453
everyone thinks they're doing the right thing.

1142
00:38:57.453 --> 00:38:59.789
Otherwise, they wouldn't do it.

1143
00:38:59.789 --> 00:39:00.923
You know, I mean, even the sick people.

1144
00:39:00.923 --> 00:39:03.158
They all think they're doing the right thing.

1145
00:39:03.158 --> 00:39:06.429
So that gives me hope for humanity, because,

1146
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:09.533
fundamentally, we want to do the right thing,

1147
00:39:09.533 --> 00:39:11.734
it's just what's the perception of right?

1148
00:39:11.734 --> 00:39:15.404
As long as we're holding a belief,

1149
00:39:15.404 --> 00:39:18.074
we're ceasing to question what is right and what is wrong,

1150
00:39:18.074 --> 00:39:19.309
because we're holding it.

1151
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:21.411
This is right!

1152
00:39:21.411 --> 00:39:24.580
Everyone, this one.

1153
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.715
But is it?

1154
00:39:25.715 --> 00:39:29.851
Why don't you put that down, and go,

1155
00:39:29.851 --> 00:39:32.938
maybe it's all just a painting.

1156
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.126
<v ->You can find out where Mark is teaching next,</v>

1157
00:39:36.126 --> 00:39:37.827
by clicking on his link below.

1158
00:39:37.827 --> 00:39:40.395
Meanwhile, if you enjoy a good philosophical debate

1159
00:39:40.395 --> 00:39:43.099
as to the nature of human evolution and enlightenment,

1160
00:39:43.099 --> 00:39:45.568
you might also find the work of Peter Russell,

1161
00:39:45.568 --> 00:39:49.304
Dr. Christine Page, and Ashok Gangadean very intriguing.

1162
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:52.008
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1163
00:39:52.008 --> 00:39:57.008
(twinkling bell music)
