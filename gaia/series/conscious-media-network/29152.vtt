(percussion music)

2
00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.278 line:15% 
<v ->Stephen Bassett's website, Paradigm Research Group,</v>

3
00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:18.432 line:15% 
is one of the top clearinghouses for documents

4
00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:21.152 line:15% 
regarding governmental coverups on the disclosure

5
00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:23.284 line:15% 
of UFOs and alien contact.

6
00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.397 line:15% 
I caught up with Stephen after nearly five years

7
00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:27.423 line:15% 
to see how disclosure is progressing

8
00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:30.959 line:15% 
and the repercussions of a government run by secrecy.

9
00:00:44.948 --> 00:00:47.210 line:15% 
Stephen, it's been about five years since we last

10
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.044 line:15% 
saw each other, which was in Sedona,

11
00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:51.508 line:15% 
now we're in California, southern California today.

12
00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:55.000 line:15% 
And a lot has happened with your group,

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.287 line:15% 
I mean, Paradigm Research Group,

14
00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:59.071 line:15% 
a lot has happened in the last five years,

15
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.194 line:15% 
and I thought what we'd do at first is just have

16
00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.220 line:15% 
you catch us up on what you're doing now,

17
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.492 line:15% 
what has progressed since we last talked?

18
00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:07.412 line:15% 
<v ->Okay, it is good to be back with you,</v>

19
00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:09.790 line:15% 
it's amazing that five years has gone by.

20
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.230 line:15% 
<v Woman>I know, just zipped.</v>

21
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.697 line:15% 
<v ->Well Paradigm Research Group was founded in '96.</v>

22
00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:17.491 line:15% 
It is an advocacy organization.

23
00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:19.960 line:15% 
I guess you could say I'm a political,

24
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.699 line:15% 
or exo-political activist.

25
00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:24.259 line:15% 
It is, in fact, not a research group,

26
00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.493 line:15% 
but rather it started by my registering as a lobbyist

27
00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:31.384 line:15% 
for a number of organizations, research organizations,

28
00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:33.762 line:15% 
thus the name Paradigm Research Group,

29
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.927 line:15% 
but in fact it's a political activist.

30
00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.210 line:15% 
It was created for one reason only,

31
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.082 line:15% 
and that is to resolve the UFO, ET question

32
00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:44.663 line:15% 
at the basic level, once and for all,

33
00:01:44.663 --> 00:01:46.263 line:15% 
through political means.

34
00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:48.470 line:15% 
Why political means?

35
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.672 line:15% 
Because a scientific resolution

36
00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:56.555 line:15% 
was not possible because of the fact

37
00:01:56.555 --> 00:01:58.891 line:15% 
that the United States government

38
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.475 line:15% 
instituted a formal policy, which was well underway

39
00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:07.179 line:15% 
by the early 1950's, but sort of started 1947,

40
00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.685 line:15% 
that this issue, in fact, would be embargoed

41
00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:13.226 line:15% 
from the people, acknowledgment would be embargoed.

42
00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:17.268 line:15% 
They would undermine research, if necessary.

43
00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.327 line:15% 
They would tinker with the media,

44
00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:20.713 line:15% 
they would ridicule the issue,

45
00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:22.527 line:15% 
ghetto-ize it, as I like to say,

46
00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:26.505 line:15% 
because they did not want the public

47
00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:29.006 line:15% 
too, how would you say, involved with it.

48
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:32.078 line:15% 
They would prefer that it was left to them.

49
00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:34.403 line:15% 
It was a national security matter, and what have you.

50
00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:37.838 line:15% 
And so you had a direct intervention by the state

51
00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:39.683 line:15% 
in the process of learning.

52
00:02:39.683 --> 00:02:42.701 line:15% 
Somewhat similar to what the Catholic Church did

53
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:46.360 line:15% 
when they directly intervened in the process

54
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.920 line:15% 
of learning the nature of the solar system,

55
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.160 line:15% 
the Copernican revolution.

56
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.719 line:15% 
They have since apologized for that, which is good.

57
00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.122 line:15% 
This is not something religion or the state should do.

58
00:02:57.122 --> 00:03:00.364 line:15% 
Even they often are short-term means,

59
00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:04.663 line:15% 
stay in the truth business, that gives you the best results.

60
00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:08.439 line:15% 
Anyway, because of that intervention, the truth embargo,

61
00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.364 line:15% 
the citizen scientist could have proven the ET issue

62
00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:15.297 line:15% 
10 times over, it didn't matter what they did,

63
00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:17.878 line:15% 
it didn't matter how diligent they were in their research,

64
00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:20.272 line:15% 
it was not going to be acknowledged.

65
00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:23.163 line:15% 
The only way this issue gets resolved at the basic level

66
00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:26.032 line:15% 
is for the government to end that policy.

67
00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:29.307 line:15% 
The ending of the truth embargo would be the disclosure

68
00:03:29.307 --> 00:03:30.726 line:15% 
event,
<v Woman>Right.</v>

69
00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:32.667 line:15% 
<v ->which is the goal of the political activism.</v>

70
00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.670 line:15% 
It is the goal that Paradigm Research Group seeks,

71
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.498 line:15% 
as well as all the organizations it works with, seek.

72
00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:41.270 line:15% 
It is the goal of the movement.

73
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.232 line:15% 
The disclosure event is the formal acknowledgment--

74
00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:44.304 line:15% 
<v Woman>Were you at disclosure,</v>

75
00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:46.042 line:15% 
you were at the disclosure event in D.C.,

76
00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.304 line:15% 
Greer's disclosure event.
<v ->Well, it was,</v>

77
00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:51.343 line:15% 
it was a witness press conference put on

78
00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:53.135 line:15% 
by the disclosure project.
<v Woman>Right.</v>

79
00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:55.236 line:15% 
<v ->So it was part of the disclosure movement.</v>

80
00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:56.490 line:15% 
<v Woman>But you were there.</v>
<v ->And I was there, absolutely.</v>

81
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.524 line:15% 
<v Woman>And I was there too,</v>

82
00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:58.890 line:15% 
and that's when we first met, yes.

83
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.087 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, that's right, I've been to every one</v>

84
00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:02.613 line:15% 
of the press conferences held there.

85
00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:04.351 line:15% 
<v Woman>But the point is, that was a really pivotal</v>

86
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:06.612 line:15% 
opportunity.
<v ->It was an opportunity,</v>

87
00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:10.793 line:15% 
it was a more powerful event in this process

88
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:15.241 line:15% 
that we've been following, and as I've stated many times,

89
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:19.849 line:15% 
could well have had a fairly dramatic impact

90
00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.687 line:15% 
were it not for nine one one.

91
00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:26.442 line:15% 
That event, which was only four months later,

92
00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:30.441 line:15% 
essentially eliminated any of the potentials

93
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:31.881 line:15% 
from that witness press conference,

94
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:34.985 line:15% 
the threads were not followed up, the media went elsewhere,

95
00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:37.385 line:15% 
and it was a significant setback to the disclosure,

96
00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:38.846 line:15% 
disclosure process.
<v Woman>Well what struck me</v>

97
00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.320 line:15% 
about it was that room was full, there was media

98
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.478 line:15% 
from all over the world, and there were virtually no reports

99
00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:47.165 line:15% 
that made the airwaves in the United States,

100
00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:48.723 line:15% 
just a couple stations.

101
00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.878 line:15% 
It did make the airwaves in other countries, but again,

102
00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:52.979 line:15% 
this thing you're talking about, the truth embargo,

103
00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.485 line:15% 
I remember one of the journalists for,

104
00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:59.122 line:15% 
I think it was a local ABC affiliate, stood up at that time

105
00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:02.077 line:15% 
and said, "We're not allowed to put this stuff on.

106
00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:03.655 line:15% 
"I'll tell you, it's not like it's the first time

107
00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:04.861 line:15% 
"we've heard about it."

108
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:06.482 line:15% 
And I remember, he was so impassioned,

109
00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:08.082 line:15% 
he was actually angry when he was talking

110
00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:10.162 line:15% 
about the fact that they're not allowed to,

111
00:05:10.162 --> 00:05:12.562 line:15% 
and I thought, "What are you doing here with a camera?"

112
00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:18.432 line:15% 
<v ->I pay a lot closer attention to these kind of events</v>

113
00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:20.347 line:15% 
and what the media does, in fact PRG,

114
00:05:20.347 --> 00:05:23.146 line:15% 
one of its key functions, it's tracking the mainstream

115
00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:24.800 line:15% 
media coverage of this issue.

116
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.626 line:15% 
And at the website, Paradigm Research Group,

117
00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:30.186 line:15% 
you will see the largest mainstream media archive

118
00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:33.877 line:15% 
in the world, which is now at over 5,000 articles

119
00:05:33.877 --> 00:05:36.405 line:15% 
of mainstream coverage of the UFO issue.

120
00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:37.545 line:15% 
So I tend to follow it.

121
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.265 line:15% 
So I happen to know that there was some coverage

122
00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:43.679 line:15% 
of that event, it was...
<v Woman>minuscule,</v>

123
00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:45.460 line:15% 
compared to what it could have been.

124
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.604 line:15% 
<v ->Well, it wasn't appropriate, but there were</v>

125
00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:50.921 line:15% 
a number of articles, anyway, but it was 2001,

126
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.302 line:15% 
and the media, which is now turning our way,

127
00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:56.403 line:15% 
which is coming around to our side,

128
00:05:56.403 --> 00:05:58.697 line:15% 
was in the early stages of that.

129
00:05:58.697 --> 00:06:02.920 line:15% 
And so it, I could show you that same event today

130
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.342 line:15% 
would get far more coverage.
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

131
00:06:05.342 --> 00:06:07.795 line:15% 
<v ->But there were things going on behind the scenes,</v>

132
00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:11.795 line:15% 
including ABC News, was seriously considering

133
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:13.437 line:15% 
investigating a number of those witnesses,

134
00:06:13.437 --> 00:06:15.698 line:15% 
interviewing them, and bringing them on.

135
00:06:18.288 --> 00:06:21.597 line:15% 
But the fact was is that nine one one ended that threat

136
00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:25.815 line:15% 
and set the movement back

137
00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:28.908 line:15% 
at least two years.

138
00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:32.492 line:15% 
And in the following year, I know Steven Greer's

139
00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.051 line:15% 
Disclosure Project, he started the movement in a somewhat

140
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:37.409 line:15% 
different direction, he started exploring the alternative

141
00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.246 line:15% 
energy issues very intensely.

142
00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:45.119 line:15% 
My next move was to run for Congress in 2002,

143
00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.039 line:15% 
which I started early that year.

144
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.226 line:15% 
So about three or four months later,

145
00:06:49.226 --> 00:06:51.199 line:15% 
my way of sort of getting back in the saddle

146
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.586 line:15% 
was to run for Congress.

147
00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:54.324 line:15% 
'Cause I saw an opportunity to get on the ballot

148
00:06:54.324 --> 00:06:56.447 line:15% 
in the eighth congressional district of Maryland,

149
00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:57.919 line:15% 
right next to Washington.

150
00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.425 line:15% 
And so I was able to do that, and that got me back going,

151
00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:04.718 line:15% 
and then in 2004 is when I launched

152
00:07:04.718 --> 00:07:07.310 line:15% 
the X-Conference in Washington, D.C.

153
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.571 line:15% 
And so we're picking up the activism,

154
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.662 line:15% 
other groups are doing their thing,

155
00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:13.624 line:15% 
and we move forward from 2001.

156
00:07:13.624 --> 00:07:17.869 line:15% 
Now we interviewed in 2005, four years later.

157
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:21.896 line:15% 
And definitely I was seeing

158
00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:25.800 line:15% 
a significant change in media coverage, and we were starting

159
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.118 line:15% 
to see the full-fledged involvement of other countries.

160
00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:32.275 line:15% 
Other countries started stepping out on the issue.

161
00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:34.280 line:15% 
This starts around 2004,

162
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.136 line:15% 
this is a very important development.

163
00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:39.080 line:15% 
<v Woman>France and a few others, didn't they start</v>

164
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.979 line:15% 
declassifying documents?
<v ->Yes, it begins</v>

165
00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:48.597 line:15% 
in late 1999 when a French group

166
00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:52.342 line:15% 
called COMETA releases the COMETA report, which concluded

167
00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:54.144 line:15% 
that the extraterrestrial hypothesis was the only

168
00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:56.618 line:15% 
way to explain this phenomenon.

169
00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:57.983 line:15% 
This was a message, I'm pretty sure,

170
00:07:57.983 --> 00:07:59.840 line:15% 
from the French government, through a non-governmental

171
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.200 line:15% 
entity, to the U.S., "Get on with it already."

172
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.266 line:15% 
And then four years later, Mexico announces

173
00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:10.068 line:15% 
it's cooperating with UFO researchers,

174
00:08:10.068 --> 00:08:11.733 line:15% 
it releases some information.

175
00:08:11.733 --> 00:08:13.764 line:15% 
Brazil announces it's cooperating,

176
00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:15.087 line:15% 
this is through their Air Force,

177
00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:16.623 line:15% 
starts releasing their files.

178
00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:19.247 line:15% 
And then France announced it's gonna release his files.

179
00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:22.947 line:15% 
And so every year after 2004, every year we have

180
00:08:22.947 --> 00:08:24.985 line:15% 
another country coming forward and starting to release

181
00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:26.500 line:15% 
its, quote, UFO files.

182
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.803 line:15% 
<v Woman>Who are some of the recent ones since 2005?</v>

183
00:08:28.803 --> 00:08:32.643 line:15% 
<v ->Well, you had France,</v>

184
00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:34.680 line:15% 
the U.K.--
<v Woman>The U.K., right.</v>

185
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.894 line:15% 
<v ->Canada, Denmark, Sweden,</v>

186
00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:43.171 line:15% 
Uruguay, Brazil,

187
00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:46.305
Russia announced they might

188
00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:48.982 line:15% 
be releasing Navy files, declassifying their Navy files

189
00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:53.024 line:15% 
from underwater encounters, and then New Zealand,

190
00:08:53.024 --> 00:08:54.880 line:15% 
I think, early this year.

191
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.395 line:15% 
It's about 11, all total.

192
00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:57.995 line:15% 
We expect some more soon.

193
00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.915 line:15% 
So that's a significant development--

194
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:01.899 line:15% 
<v Woman>Yes, it is.</v>
<v ->that really gets underway</v>

195
00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:04.245 line:15% 
just about the time we're doing our interview.

196
00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:06.965 line:15% 
And what is happening here is by doing this,

197
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.565 line:15% 
these nations are doing two things.

198
00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:11.424 line:15% 
One, they are kind of getting on the right side

199
00:09:11.424 --> 00:09:15.925 line:15% 
of the issue, meaning we're releasing our files proactively,

200
00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:19.328 line:15% 
we're opening up, as it were.

201
00:09:19.328 --> 00:09:21.226 line:15% 
Now, they're not releasing what you would call

202
00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:23.700 line:15% 
smoking guns, and most of those countries

203
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.189 line:15% 
have such evidence, typically it would be in a form

204
00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:29.471 line:15% 
of gun camera footage from their chase planes

205
00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:31.882 line:15% 
and their defense air force systems, where they go up

206
00:09:31.882 --> 00:09:33.795 line:15% 
and they chase these things and they film them.

207
00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:36.099 line:15% 
That they don't release, but they're releasing files

208
00:09:36.099 --> 00:09:37.656 line:15% 
that clearly are stimulating the issue,

209
00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:39.682 line:15% 
they're being downloaded all over the world.

210
00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:41.293 line:15% 
Millions and millions of downloads of these files

211
00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:42.957 line:15% 
have taken place, so they're now accumulating

212
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.739 line:15% 
in servers all over the world.

213
00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:46.402 line:15% 
And the other thing you're doing is sending a message

214
00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:49.357 line:15% 
to the United States, "Look, we sort of had

215
00:09:49.357 --> 00:09:51.799 line:15% 
"this understanding with you that goes back

216
00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:55.842 line:15% 
"to the early '50's, that we would wait for you

217
00:09:55.842 --> 00:09:58.145 line:15% 
"to decide when it was safe to tell the world

218
00:09:58.145 --> 00:09:59.906 line:15% 
"about the extraterrestrials.

219
00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:02.466 line:15% 
"Well, we're getting impatient.

220
00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:04.983 line:15% 
"The Cold War has been over, what, nine,

221
00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:09.441 line:15% 
"10, 12, 15 years and you haven't done anything yet."

222
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:13.270 line:15% 
And so this is a message they're sending, in my view.

223
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.310 line:15% 
And other things are happening.

224
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.286 line:15% 
There has been a very significant change

225
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.910 line:15% 
in the amount of coverage of this issue in China.

226
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.011 line:15% 
There's always been sightings in China,

227
00:10:24.011 --> 00:10:26.944 line:15% 
but suddenly they're being covered in the media there,

228
00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:28.587 line:15% 
and then that coverage is getting out

229
00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:31.328 line:15% 
into the English language press.

230
00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:34.005 line:15% 
And so China's in the news a lot about this,

231
00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:36.362 line:15% 
including this remarkable stretch of about six months

232
00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:38.805 line:15% 
where eight airports had to close down

233
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.127 line:15% 
because of sightings.

234
00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:42.271 line:15% 
Now that's not common, right?

235
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:44.405 line:15% 
Let's count the times that an airport in the United States

236
00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:47.146 line:15% 
has been closed down for UFOs.

237
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:51.711 line:15% 
One effort is under way in China

238
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:55.081 line:15% 
to sort of mitigate that by saying that the problem is

239
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:57.780 line:15% 
that all these new Chinese billionaires are buying

240
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.022 line:15% 
private jets and they're so special because they're so rich

241
00:11:01.022 --> 00:11:02.462 line:15% 
they just fly wherever they want to,

242
00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.096 line:15% 
and they're flying through restricted air space.

243
00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:08.562 line:15% 
Well, it's possible, but you know,

244
00:11:08.562 --> 00:11:12.221 line:15% 
if I was a recently wealthy Chinese billionaire,

245
00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:14.856 line:15% 
I don't think I'd be flying my jet through a restricted

246
00:11:14.856 --> 00:11:17.874 line:15% 
air space and risk having my wonderful life terminated

247
00:11:17.874 --> 00:11:20.839 line:15% 
by a Chinese air force jet.

248
00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:23.521 line:15% 
So something is going on there.

249
00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.630 line:15% 
Coupled with the fact that China has an emerging

250
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.967 line:15% 
spage program, they plan to go to the moon,

251
00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:30.481 line:15% 
they're thinking of going to Mars,

252
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:32.103 line:15% 
they've got satellites up there.

253
00:11:32.103 --> 00:11:34.385 line:15% 
They've encouraged and been quite comfortable

254
00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:36.785 line:15% 
with UFO research there for years.

255
00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:39.004 line:15% 
Opens the possibilty that China

256
00:11:39.004 --> 00:11:40.870 line:15% 
may be the one to move first on this.

257
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.929 line:15% 
And so these are the kinds of things that are going on.

258
00:11:42.929 --> 00:11:44.145 line:15% 
Let me be clear.

259
00:11:44.145 --> 00:11:47.532 line:15% 
The amount of things happening worldwide

260
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:52.235 line:15% 
related to the UFO question and disclosure processes

261
00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:55.350 line:15% 
is now so much, I cannot keep up with it.

262
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.547 line:15% 
It is not possible to keep up with it.

263
00:11:57.547 --> 00:11:59.615 line:15% 
And I'm devoted to doing that.

264
00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:00.811 line:15% 
<v Woman>You're right, that's your job.</v>

265
00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:02.208 line:15% 
<v ->Now that's exactly what I expected.</v>

266
00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:04.672 line:15% 
It's very much like a pot boiling.

267
00:12:04.672 --> 00:12:07.370 line:15% 
So you put it on, the temperature rises, right,

268
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.429 line:15% 
but before it actually boils,

269
00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:11.615 line:15% 
you start seeing bubbles turning up, right?

270
00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:13.450 line:15% 
Here and there and whatever.

271
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.911 line:15% 
And you're trying to follow them all,

272
00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:16.191 line:15% 
but you can't quite keep up with them,

273
00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:18.014 line:15% 
and then finally it boils.

274
00:12:18.014 --> 00:12:20.170 line:15% 
We're right at the boiling point.

275
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.950 line:15% 
And you can see these bubbles are rising

276
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.807 line:15% 
all around at different places.

277
00:12:23.807 --> 00:12:26.494 line:15% 
This is exactly what I've expected.

278
00:12:26.494 --> 00:12:29.726 line:15% 
It's going to be very chaotic, well,

279
00:12:29.726 --> 00:12:33.790 line:15% 
chaotic, not in a bad sense, with a great deal happening,

280
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.246 line:15% 
lots of speculation, predictions, new stories

281
00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:39.870 line:15% 
happening very quickly, governments taking actions

282
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.192 line:15% 
one after the other.

283
00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:43.272 line:15% 
This is what I anticipated happening prior

284
00:12:43.272 --> 00:12:45.288 line:15% 
to the disclosure event.

285
00:12:45.288 --> 00:12:47.688 line:15% 
Now, this could have been avoided if the U.S.

286
00:12:47.688 --> 00:12:50.589 line:15% 
had acted proactively sooner.

287
00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:53.265 line:15% 
But apparently the policy of the U.S. government,

288
00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:54.845 line:15% 
at least, I say government, I'm talking about

289
00:12:54.845 --> 00:12:58.386 line:15% 
the military intelligence committees that run this issue,

290
00:12:58.386 --> 00:13:00.018 line:15% 
it's not run by the United States Congress,

291
00:13:00.018 --> 00:13:03.036 line:15% 
it's not run by the President, that they have decided

292
00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:05.457 line:15% 
to sort of hold out until the last minute.

293
00:13:05.457 --> 00:13:07.196 line:15% 
<v Woman>Why, have you been able to glean</v>

294
00:13:07.196 --> 00:13:09.916 line:15% 
anything as to the motivations of taking

295
00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:12.028 line:15% 
this position after all these years?

296
00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:13.990 line:15% 
It seem archaic, I mean--
<v ->Well we don't know</v>

297
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.835 line:15% 
for certain, because they don't tell us,

298
00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:17.510 line:15% 
I mean, remember it's a secret.

299
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.875 line:15% 
<v Woman>I just wondered if you've heard,</v>

300
00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:20.272 line:15% 
you have access to people, I've just wondered

301
00:13:20.272 --> 00:13:22.608 line:15% 
if you've heard any useful speculation even

302
00:13:22.608 --> 00:13:23.974 line:15% 
as to why they're dragging their feet.

303
00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:25.712 line:15% 
<v ->Useful speculation, yes.</v>

304
00:13:25.712 --> 00:13:28.368 line:15% 
The assessment, the best assessment we have

305
00:13:28.368 --> 00:13:32.912 line:15% 
is that since 1991, when the Cold War was really over,

306
00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:36.992 line:15% 
that, not surprisingly, the consensus

307
00:13:36.992 --> 00:13:40.903 line:15% 
within those who truly manage this issue,

308
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:43.900 line:15% 
eventually move towards disclosure, meaning,

309
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.134 line:15% 
"Okay, we do need to bring this out, okay, fine."

310
00:13:48.134 --> 00:13:51.110 line:15% 
So that's happened, we think, since 1991.

311
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.667 line:15% 
Exactly when it turned to a majority, yeah, but...

312
00:13:55.835 --> 00:14:00.176 line:15% 
Now, just because the consensus is now to disclose,

313
00:14:00.176 --> 00:14:03.355 line:15% 
doesn't mean, "Okay, we'll just do it."

314
00:14:03.355 --> 00:14:06.491 line:15% 
They're down there looking at the total world picture

315
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.912 line:15% 
and trying to assess, is this a good time,

316
00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:11.770 line:15% 
is this the year to do it, is the president somebody

317
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.455 line:15% 
we can work with, what's the situation

318
00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:15.151 line:15% 
in the Middle East, and what have you.

319
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:19.853 line:15% 
And I'm sure that there are a lot of reasons

320
00:14:19.853 --> 00:14:23.467 line:15% 
why they could justify holding off.

321
00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:26.774 line:15% 
Plus, it is a big deal, I mean this is the biggest event

322
00:14:26.774 --> 00:14:28.949 line:15% 
in human history, as far as I'm concerned,

323
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:31.872 line:15% 
measured on the ability for it to impact

324
00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.472 line:15% 
the greatest number of people in the shortest

325
00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:35.605 line:15% 
amount of time, nothing comes close in the past.

326
00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:37.834 line:15% 
There've been some big events, nothing like this.

327
00:14:37.834 --> 00:14:40.970 line:15% 
Within 72 hours of disclosure, 80 to 90%

328
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.532 line:15% 
of the entire world population will know this has happened.

329
00:14:44.532 --> 00:14:46.570 line:15% 
And their whole world is going

330
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.087 line:15% 
to start changing a little bit.

331
00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:52.169 line:15% 
So it's a big deal, and so consequently,

332
00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:54.868 line:15% 
it's a nontrivial matter, and I'm sure

333
00:14:54.868 --> 00:14:57.790 line:15% 
they're wrapped up in the logistics and how to go

334
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.649 line:15% 
about it, and so forth, and so they're kicking

335
00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.686 line:15% 
the can down the road, thinking,

336
00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:05.385 line:15% 
"Maybe the situation would be a little more conducive

337
00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:07.586 line:15% 
"in July, or next year."

338
00:15:08.722 --> 00:15:11.794 line:15% 
And so because they have taken that approach,

339
00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:14.940 line:15% 
the rest of the world is not kicking the can down the road.

340
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.839 line:15% 
The disclosure movement is picking up steam,

341
00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:18.396 line:15% 
other nations are stepping in.

342
00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:19.900 line:15% 
And so by holding off, holding off,

343
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.481 line:15% 
we are creating the boiling pot scenario.

344
00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:24.839 line:15% 
<v Woman>Well Jesse Ventura stepped up to the plate.</v>

345
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:26.620 line:15% 
<v ->Ah, there's another development there.</v>

346
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.596 line:15% 
Let's go there, amongst the main things--

347
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.377 line:15% 
<v Woman>Mainstream, mainstream, that's what's interesting</v>

348
00:15:31.377 --> 00:15:32.955 line:15% 
about Jesse, we know all this,

349
00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:34.694 line:15% 
we've been in these circles a long time.

350
00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:36.411
Jesse took it out to television.

351
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:37.958
<v ->We're not shocked.</v>

352
00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.339
Yeah, one of the many developments that I referred

353
00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:44.176 line:15% 
to earlier, that we're trying to keep up with

354
00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:46.959 line:15% 
in this near, about-to-boil pot,

355
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:50.496 line:15% 
is what I am now calling

356
00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:54.816 line:15% 
the first true counter-insurgency

357
00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:58.362 line:15% 
in opposition to rule by secrecy.

358
00:15:58.362 --> 00:16:00.607 line:15% 
He said, "One of the most, there have been a number

359
00:16:00.607 --> 00:16:04.713 line:15% 
"of major trends, threads since 1945."

360
00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.772 line:15% 
And we don't have time to get into all of them,

361
00:16:06.772 --> 00:16:11.720 line:15% 
but one of them is the emergency of secrecy

362
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.653 line:15% 
as an endemic tool of government,

363
00:16:15.653 --> 00:16:17.210 line:15% 
worse than ever.

364
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.033 line:15% 
The rise of what I call the secret empires

365
00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:20.986 line:15% 
in the United States, in the Soviet Union,

366
00:16:20.986 --> 00:16:23.673 line:15% 
in communist China, in the United Kingdom,

367
00:16:23.673 --> 00:16:27.705 line:15% 
in Israel, France, whatever, these are fully clandestine

368
00:16:27.705 --> 00:16:32.164 line:15% 
operations operating classified status and they've grown

369
00:16:32.164 --> 00:16:34.190 line:15% 
and grown and grown since '45.

370
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.768 line:15% 
Now the biggest one is the United States, without question.

371
00:16:36.768 --> 00:16:39.615 line:15% 
It is the secret empire, and it's vast.

372
00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:44.506 line:15% 
And increasingly, what you are seeing is governments,

373
00:16:44.506 --> 00:16:47.764 line:15% 
corporations too, definitely corporations,

374
00:16:47.764 --> 00:16:50.931 line:15% 
more and more conducting their operations

375
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:53.385 line:15% 
in secrecy, from a secret posture.

376
00:16:53.385 --> 00:16:56.585 line:15% 
And as, obviously given the influence that governments

377
00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:58.782 line:15% 
have over people, given the influence that huge corporations

378
00:16:58.782 --> 00:17:01.406 line:15% 
have over people, this eventually becomes

379
00:17:01.406 --> 00:17:04.382 line:15% 
rule by secrecy, as Jim Marrs calls it.

380
00:17:04.382 --> 00:17:06.323 line:15% 
This isn't good, and we don't like it,

381
00:17:06.323 --> 00:17:08.104 line:15% 
and it's causing a lot of trouble.

382
00:17:08.104 --> 00:17:09.970 line:15% 
But the effort to sort of counter it

383
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.381 line:15% 
has been virtually non-existent.

384
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:15.485 line:15% 
There has been nothing approaching a true

385
00:17:15.485 --> 00:17:16.829 line:15% 
secrecy reform movement.

386
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.890 line:15% 
There have been a few minor efforts at it,

387
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.186 line:15% 
a few books, but nothing of consequence.

388
00:17:23.186 --> 00:17:27.506 line:15% 
Until, perhaps, recently, when I think a true

389
00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:30.162 line:15% 
counter-insurgency begins.

390
00:17:30.162 --> 00:17:34.300 line:15% 
And there are two parts of it that are worth noting now.

391
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.748 line:15% 
One of them is a true phenomena called WikiLeaks.

392
00:17:39.878 --> 00:17:44.433 line:15% 
And the other, best example of this would be

393
00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:48.837 line:15% 
the Conspiracy Theory program with Jesse Ventura

394
00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:51.077 line:15% 
on Truth Television.

395
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:54.149 line:15% 
Let's first talk about Jesse Ventura.

396
00:17:54.149 --> 00:17:58.544 line:15% 
I expected this show to be a typical schlock reality show.

397
00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:03.023 line:15% 
Jesse, after all, was a professional wrestler, alright.

398
00:18:03.023 --> 00:18:06.330 line:15% 
In fact, I think he was famous for a pink boa

399
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.887 line:15% 
that he used to wear.
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

400
00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.746 line:15% 
There was that part of his career path.

401
00:18:10.746 --> 00:18:12.484 line:15% 
<v ->Right, right, but he's also a Navy Seal.</v>

402
00:18:12.484 --> 00:18:13.561 line:15% 
<v Woman>And a governor.</v>
<v ->And eventually he became</v>

403
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.983 line:15% 
governor of Minnesota, he is a unique person,

404
00:18:15.983 --> 00:18:18.127
without question.
<v Woman>He is a courageous</v>

405
00:18:18.127 --> 00:18:20.142 line:15% 
person, I say that because what man would wear

406
00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:21.966 line:15% 
a pink boa with that kind of vice.

407
00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:23.449 line:15% 
<v ->Look, you gotta be courageous to be a Navy Seal,</v>

408
00:18:23.449 --> 00:18:25.443 line:15% 
you gotta be courageous to wear a pink boa.

409
00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:27.641 line:15% 
Though I should ask him, if I ever meet him,

410
00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.933 line:15% 
"Did you ever wear a pink boa to one of those

411
00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:31.310 line:15% 
"reunions of Navy Seals?"

412
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.568 line:15% 
That would have been interesting.

413
00:18:32.568 --> 00:18:34.350 line:15% 
But in any event, Jesse Ventura

414
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.365 line:15% 
becomes governor of Minnesota.

415
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.605 line:15% 
It's one of the most interesting elections

416
00:18:38.605 --> 00:18:40.555 line:15% 
of the last 20 years.

417
00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:43.030 line:15% 
He ran as an independent, he split the party vote,

418
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.227 line:15% 
and becomes governor, and it was really quite astounding.

419
00:18:45.227 --> 00:18:49.334 line:15% 
He did it as a man dedicated to the truth,

420
00:18:49.334 --> 00:18:51.232 line:15% 
frank, tell you exactly what he thinks,

421
00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:52.874 line:15% 
people are craving that.
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

422
00:18:52.874 --> 00:18:54.645 line:15% 
<v ->He had a wonderful persona, whatever,</v>

423
00:18:54.645 --> 00:18:56.331 line:15% 
he becomes governor of Minnesota.

424
00:18:56.331 --> 00:18:58.826 line:15% 
And, forgive me if I'm recounting this, perhaps,

425
00:18:58.826 --> 00:19:02.634 line:15% 
I'm hoping I'm recounting this accurately,

426
00:19:02.634 --> 00:19:04.586 line:15% 
and he's spoken about this.

427
00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:07.711 line:15% 
But my understanding was, it was that sometime

428
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:09.673 line:15% 
after he was elected, but perhaps before he

429
00:19:09.673 --> 00:19:11.786 line:15% 
actually took office, he was called to a meeting

430
00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:14.591 line:15% 
in Washington, and for whatever reason,

431
00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:16.372 line:15% 
he wanted to go, he went.

432
00:19:16.372 --> 00:19:20.169 line:15% 
And when he got there, he was in a setting which ended

433
00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:22.463 line:15% 
up seeming almost like an interrogation.

434
00:19:22.463 --> 00:19:23.764 line:15% 
<v Woman>Yes, he talks about this.</v>

435
00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:25.097 line:15% 
<v ->And he had people sitting in front of him,</v>

436
00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:26.623 line:15% 
and I think he concluded pretty quickly a lot

437
00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:28.981 line:15% 
of them were CIA, and apparently what they really

438
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:30.699 line:15% 
wanted to know was really, "Who are you,

439
00:19:30.699 --> 00:19:32.917 line:15% 
"and how did you become governor of Minnesota?"

440
00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:34.474 line:15% 
And he didn't like it at all.

441
00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:36.682 line:15% 
And I don't know how long he stuck around--

442
00:19:36.682 --> 00:19:37.962 line:15% 
<v Woman>Well because domestic affairs are not</v>

443
00:19:37.962 --> 00:19:39.957 line:15% 
part of their purview, apparently, and he was saying,

444
00:19:39.957 --> 00:19:41.994 line:15% 
"Well, why are you interrogating me?"

445
00:19:41.994 --> 00:19:43.860 line:15% 
<v ->Well there's a whole lot of reasons why that</v>

446
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.127 line:15% 
was a bad idea, and I think he told them off and left,

447
00:19:48.127 --> 00:19:49.919 line:15% 
something to that effect.

448
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.427 line:15% 
And I think that that triggered in him a sense,

449
00:19:52.427 --> 00:19:54.891 line:15% 
if he didn't already have it, that maybe something's

450
00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:56.854 line:15% 
not quite right here.

451
00:19:56.854 --> 00:19:58.987 line:15% 
So he goes on, he governs Minnesota,

452
00:19:58.987 --> 00:20:02.368 line:15% 
he does pretty well, gets a lot of publicity.

453
00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:06.138 line:15% 
He leaves politics,

454
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:10.021 line:15% 
and after a short amount of time

455
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:13.764 line:15% 
approaches NBC to do a television show

456
00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:18.063 line:15% 
addressing all these issues that are in play.

457
00:20:18.063 --> 00:20:20.878 line:15% 
I guess you could them the conspiracy issues,

458
00:20:20.878 --> 00:20:23.022 line:15% 
but whatever, the controversial stuff.

459
00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.324 line:15% 
And they, of course, loved it,

460
00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:26.243 line:15% 
"Whoa, absolutely, go guy."

461
00:20:26.243 --> 00:20:29.358 line:15% 
And they signed him up to a multi-million dollar contract.

462
00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:31.746 line:15% 
He went out, created a couple of shows,

463
00:20:31.746 --> 00:20:33.379 line:15% 
the pilots, I guess, brought them back,

464
00:20:33.379 --> 00:20:34.446 line:15% 
and they just were shocked.

465
00:20:34.446 --> 00:20:36.899 line:15% 
They just, "Oh my God, we can't possibly put that on."

466
00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:41.144 line:15% 
And he said, "Fine, pay me anyway,

467
00:20:41.144 --> 00:20:43.490 line:15% 
"don't do the show, but I still get my money."

468
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.580 line:15% 
He went off to Mexico, lived well, enjoyed himself,

469
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.959 line:15% 
I suspect probably did a lot of research.

470
00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:50.793 line:15% 
And when his contract was up and he was free,

471
00:20:50.793 --> 00:20:52.937 line:15% 
he comes back and he pitches the same show

472
00:20:52.937 --> 00:20:54.910 line:15% 
to the Truth Television, True TV,

473
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.033 line:15% 
and they put it on, The Conspiracy Theory.

474
00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:58.771 line:15% 
Okay, fine.

475
00:20:58.771 --> 00:21:00.553 line:15% 
So I guess we could say, from the time he has

476
00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:02.739 line:15% 
that meeting in Washington to the time he finally

477
00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:05.736 line:15% 
puts that show on, Jesse Ventura has gotten

478
00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:08.552 line:15% 
a pretty substantial self-education in the realities

479
00:21:08.552 --> 00:21:12.776 line:15% 
of the 21st century and what has happened since 1945.

480
00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:16.919 line:15% 
And so he shocks me

481
00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:21.872 line:15% 
by putting on the show and just going

482
00:21:21.872 --> 00:21:25.675 line:15% 
after every scab on every wound,

483
00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:29.599 line:15% 
every sore spot the government's got, every issue

484
00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:31.498 line:15% 
that people are sitting out there

485
00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:32.853 line:15% 
grinding their teeth about.

486
00:21:32.853 --> 00:21:35.658 line:15% 
And while it's, a lot of showmanship in it,

487
00:21:35.658 --> 00:21:37.333 line:15% 
and it's definitely Jesse--
<v Woman>It's still</v>

488
00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:39.775 line:15% 
very gutsy.
<v ->the fact is, he is bringing</v>

489
00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:43.178 line:15% 
these issues into play, he is giving people like Alex Jones

490
00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:47.358 line:15% 
some time and face time, and he's opening

491
00:21:47.358 --> 00:21:48.852 line:15% 
up some doors that wouldn't be open,

492
00:21:48.852 --> 00:21:50.238 line:15% 
he's going right up on the Hill,

493
00:21:50.238 --> 00:21:52.052 line:15% 
he's sitting down in front of congressmen

494
00:21:52.052 --> 00:21:55.219 line:15% 
and asking them questions they don't want to answer.

495
00:21:55.219 --> 00:21:57.171 line:15% 
And so this show has the potential

496
00:21:57.171 --> 00:22:00.158 line:15% 
to be a game changer.
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

497
00:22:00.158 --> 00:22:02.611 line:15% 
<v ->There've been two seasons.</v>

498
00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:05.011 line:15% 
It's worth noting that they stayed away from the UFO, ET

499
00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:06.995 line:15% 
issue in those first two seasons.

500
00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:09.479 line:15% 
<v Woman>Well, they did go to Area 51.</v>

501
00:22:09.479 --> 00:22:11.912 line:15% 
<v ->They did a somewhat non-UFO treatment of Area 51,</v>

502
00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:14.098 line:15% 
but I have high confidence that the UFO issue

503
00:22:14.098 --> 00:22:15.815 line:15% 
is not far behind.

504
00:22:15.815 --> 00:22:18.791 line:15% 
And so, okay, here you have on one hand

505
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:22.652 line:15% 
this former Navy Seal, with his big head

506
00:22:22.652 --> 00:22:25.138 line:15% 
and his huge persona, standing in front of the camera

507
00:22:25.138 --> 00:22:26.492 line:15% 
always at the end of the show, saying,

508
00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:28.657 line:15% 
"I'm Jesse Ventura, and we're getting this done."

509
00:22:28.657 --> 00:22:30.758 line:15% 
And that appeals to a certain segment of the population,

510
00:22:30.758 --> 00:22:32.337 line:15% 
and I love it, and I love this guy,

511
00:22:32.337 --> 00:22:33.553 line:15% 
and I hope to get to meet him.

512
00:22:33.553 --> 00:22:38.353 line:15% 
Now, about the same time that he approaches Truth TV

513
00:22:38.353 --> 00:22:43.196 line:15% 
to put this show together, something else is happening.

514
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:46.076 line:15% 
Out of Australia, a gentleman by the name

515
00:22:46.076 --> 00:22:50.279 line:15% 
of Julian Assange, a computer hacker

516
00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:54.993 line:15% 
and computer genius, makes a decision

517
00:22:54.993 --> 00:22:58.939 line:15% 
to try to create the first major global

518
00:22:58.939 --> 00:23:02.800 line:15% 
whistle-blower site, really, is what it is.

519
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.792 line:15% 
And it's a serious effort.

520
00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.563 line:15% 
Money is raised, supporters are garnered,

521
00:23:09.563 --> 00:23:13.765 line:15% 
the structure of it, the server structure of it

522
00:23:13.765 --> 00:23:17.819 line:15% 
is developed in advance, his ability to travel

523
00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:20.400 line:15% 
around the world is all developed in advance.

524
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.960 line:15% 
And then he launched this site, and immediately started

525
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.120 line:15% 
putting up documents from unnamed sources,

526
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.786 line:15% 
but nevertheless that are addressing issues

527
00:23:29.786 --> 00:23:32.607 line:15% 
of abuse of power of one kind or another.

528
00:23:32.607 --> 00:23:34.570 line:15% 
Doesn't get a lot of attention initially,

529
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.247 line:15% 
and it slowly grows over a period of three years.

530
00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:39.924 line:15% 
Assange moves around the world very regularly,

531
00:23:39.924 --> 00:23:42.943 line:15% 
doesn't stay in one place, he's an Australian citizen.

532
00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:45.246 line:15% 
I hear a litlte bit from time to time,

533
00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:49.411 line:15% 
I don't take special note until about six months ago,

534
00:23:49.411 --> 00:23:51.950 line:15% 
when WikiLeaks apparently decides

535
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.518 line:15% 
to make a major move.

536
00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:55.630 line:15% 
It gets a huge amount of information.

537
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.977 line:15% 
It's now pretty much established, I think,

538
00:23:57.977 --> 00:24:00.195 line:15% 
and so they really initiate, I guess,

539
00:24:00.195 --> 00:24:02.616 line:15% 
the counter-insurgency that I'm talking about.

540
00:24:02.616 --> 00:24:06.211 line:15% 
And they put up on the web a de-crypted video

541
00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:09.432 line:15% 
of an event in Baghdad where about 14 or 15 people

542
00:24:09.432 --> 00:24:11.841 line:15% 
are killed by U.S. gunships.

543
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:14.464 line:15% 
This is a very difficult 36 minutes to watch,

544
00:24:14.464 --> 00:24:16.555 line:15% 
but it puts WikiLeaks on the map.

545
00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:19.318 line:15% 
In a period of seven months, this is now a global phenomena,

546
00:24:19.318 --> 00:24:23.776 line:15% 
he is a worldwide phenomena, and he has upset

547
00:24:23.776 --> 00:24:28.240 line:15% 
virtually the entire superstructure of world government.

548
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.624 line:15% 
Members of the United States Congress are calling

549
00:24:32.624 --> 00:24:35.183 line:15% 
for his assassination in front of cameras,

550
00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:37.466 line:15% 
I find that interesting.

551
00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:41.508 line:15% 
Not surprisingly, charges have been brought against him

552
00:24:41.508 --> 00:24:44.186 line:15% 
regarding sexual misconduct in Sweden, and what have you.

553
00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:45.731 line:15% 
<v Woman>Brought against him with John, brought against</v>

554
00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:46.927 line:15% 
him--
<v ->Yeah, so where that's</v>

555
00:24:46.927 --> 00:24:48.985 line:15% 
gonna go, I don't know, but we're not surprised by this.

556
00:24:48.985 --> 00:24:51.171 line:15% 
But what's interesting is that Julian Assange

557
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:55.246 line:15% 
is this 130-pound, dripping wet, mild-mannered,

558
00:24:55.246 --> 00:24:59.246 line:15% 
sort of androgynous gentleman who has created

559
00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:04.049 line:15% 
this vast enterprise that is turning

560
00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:07.474 line:15% 
the world upside down for a whole lot of major governments

561
00:25:07.474 --> 00:25:10.717 line:15% 
and institutions, and over here we have the Navy Seal,

562
00:25:10.717 --> 00:25:12.253 line:15% 
and they're sort of two tracks.

563
00:25:12.253 --> 00:25:16.018 line:15% 
Well, this, to me, take Truth Television Conspiracy Theory,

564
00:25:16.018 --> 00:25:17.532 line:15% 
and there will be more shows like that,

565
00:25:17.532 --> 00:25:18.812 line:15% 
I guarantee it.

566
00:25:18.812 --> 00:25:20.700 line:15% 
And then you take WikiLeaks,

567
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.055 line:15% 
and whatever the outcome there,

568
00:25:22.055 --> 00:25:24.422 line:15% 
and there will be more sites like this, I guarantee it,

569
00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:28.276 line:15% 
together they represent the first true counter-insurgency

570
00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:31.594 line:15% 
against rule by secrecy, meaning, the people are finally

571
00:25:31.594 --> 00:25:34.835 line:15% 
saying, "We've had enough of this, okay.

572
00:25:34.835 --> 00:25:37.694
"It's bad enough that you govern incompetently,

573
00:25:37.694 --> 00:25:39.348
"but you govern from secrecy.

574
00:25:39.348 --> 00:25:41.086
"We don't even know what you're doing,

575
00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:44.147
"all we learn later is how much damage you've done."

576
00:25:44.147 --> 00:25:45.609 line:15% 
And they've had enough.

577
00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:49.406 line:15% 
Now, I'm not saying that WikiLeaks

578
00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:52.072 line:15% 
is a perfect representation of this.

579
00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:55.173 line:15% 
I'm not saying that Truth TV or Conspiracy Theory's

580
00:25:55.173 --> 00:25:57.370 line:15% 
got everything right, but I am saying

581
00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.484 line:15% 
that they truly reflect the fact that people are ready

582
00:26:00.484 --> 00:26:03.247 line:15% 
now to take action against this, which needs

583
00:26:03.247 --> 00:26:07.044 line:15% 
to be non-violent, it needs to be appropriate,

584
00:26:07.044 --> 00:26:09.529 line:15% 
and it needs to be within certain bounds.

585
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:11.844 line:15% 
But, let me make it clear.

586
00:26:11.844 --> 00:26:15.566 line:15% 
This is the first true test of the internet

587
00:26:15.566 --> 00:26:20.372 line:15% 
to demonstrate its ability to empower people,

588
00:26:20.372 --> 00:26:23.657 line:15% 
the collective empowerment of the global web.

589
00:26:23.657 --> 00:26:25.535 line:15% 
This is really the first true test.

590
00:26:25.535 --> 00:26:28.916 line:15% 
And I believe that if you look out at this vast

591
00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:33.150 line:15% 
internet sea, that on the horizon a tidal wave

592
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.481 line:15% 
is building, it is heading for the shore,

593
00:26:37.481 --> 00:26:41.896 line:15% 
and it is the global internet response,

594
00:26:41.896 --> 00:26:46.323 line:15% 
not only to rule by secrecy, but to whatever governments

595
00:26:46.323 --> 00:26:49.405 line:15% 
have in store for those who pursue that,

596
00:26:49.405 --> 00:26:51.122 line:15% 
such as WikiLeaks.
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

597
00:26:51.122 --> 00:26:53.864 line:15% 
<v ->And I think, when it finally reaches the shore</v>

598
00:26:53.864 --> 00:26:58.343 line:15% 
of government and institutions and corporations,

599
00:26:58.343 --> 00:27:01.607 line:15% 
it is going to be a mile high.

600
00:27:01.607 --> 00:27:05.010 line:15% 
Unless they shut the web down, and I don't think they can.

601
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.225 line:15% 
<v Woman>I don't think they can either</v>

602
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.305 line:15% 
because as we've joked about before,

603
00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:10.705 line:15% 
if they try, some 12-year-old like Assange

604
00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:12.486 line:15% 
will put it all back together again,

605
00:27:12.486 --> 00:27:14.321 line:15% 
there's so many little geniuses out there.

606
00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:15.964 line:15% 
<v ->That cat got out, that ship has sailed,</v>

607
00:27:15.964 --> 00:27:18.629 line:15% 
they let the cat out of the bag back in the early '90's.

608
00:27:18.629 --> 00:27:21.307 line:15% 
I think most of the people that are in power

609
00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:24.240 line:15% 
with bad intentions in our world didn't understand it

610
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.448 line:15% 
and it was gone before they could catch it.

611
00:27:26.448 --> 00:27:29.328 line:15% 
<v Woman>At the same time, you have some intrusive</v>

612
00:27:29.328 --> 00:27:31.941 line:15% 
treatment, I think Alex Jones' site just went through this

613
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:36.097 line:15% 
recently, where Google had essentially taken Google

614
00:27:36.097 --> 00:27:39.830 line:15% 
searches for his off, for a few, it was speculated

615
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.168 line:15% 
that it might last a few weeks, a slap on the hand,

616
00:27:43.168 --> 00:27:44.725 line:15% 
but it lasted what, a couple days, a few days,

617
00:27:44.725 --> 00:27:45.728 line:15% 
something like that.

618
00:27:45.728 --> 00:27:47.722 line:15% 
But the point is, there will be attempts to suppress

619
00:27:47.722 --> 00:27:50.101 line:15% 
and interfere on the internet, via Google.

620
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:53.023 line:15% 
<v ->Now this is a counter-insurgency, and this is,</v>

621
00:27:53.023 --> 00:27:56.682 line:15% 
I don't like to use martial metaphors, but this is a battle.

622
00:27:56.682 --> 00:27:59.508 line:15% 
This is a war, there will be battles won and lost.

623
00:27:59.508 --> 00:28:03.508 line:15% 
And so Amazon takes WikiLeaks off their server,

624
00:28:03.508 --> 00:28:05.503 line:15% 
which is one of their key presence in the U.S.

625
00:28:05.503 --> 00:28:07.209 line:15% 
A bunch of hackavists they're called now,

626
00:28:07.209 --> 00:28:08.968 line:15% 
I love this new word, hackavists,

627
00:28:08.968 --> 00:28:11.145 line:15% 
immediately go after the Amazon site.

628
00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:12.862 line:15% 
They're going after sites in Sweden.

629
00:28:12.862 --> 00:28:15.347 line:15% 
Now I'm not condoning illegal behavior,

630
00:28:15.347 --> 00:28:18.366 line:15% 
I'm simply saying, that this is,

631
00:28:18.366 --> 00:28:21.267 line:15% 
this is reality.
<v Woman>It's an appropriate</v>

632
00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:26.129 line:15% 
push back considering the degree of rule by secrecy,

633
00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:29.299 line:15% 
as Jim Marrs states, that has occurred up to this point

634
00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:32.733 line:15% 
in time, I think it's, it may be, and it may not be legal,

635
00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:34.941 line:15% 
but it is an appropriate push back.

636
00:28:34.941 --> 00:28:38.077 line:15% 
<v ->It is, it is going to be one of the most massive</v>

637
00:28:38.077 --> 00:28:40.861 line:15% 
examples of civil disobedience ever.

638
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:42.514 line:15% 
Look, this is the nature of the world.

639
00:28:42.514 --> 00:28:45.074 line:15% 
Our government's hacking Chinese computers,

640
00:28:45.074 --> 00:28:46.481 line:15% 
they're hacking our computers,

641
00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:48.177 line:15% 
corporations are hacking each other.

642
00:28:48.177 --> 00:28:51.878 line:15% 
The government's interfering with some citizen activities,

643
00:28:51.878 --> 00:28:53.852 line:15% 
and, well, guess what, there are hackers out there

644
00:28:53.852 --> 00:28:55.494 line:15% 
that are interfering with the government.

645
00:28:55.494 --> 00:28:57.798 line:15% 
Look, it's all kind of wild and crazy,

646
00:28:57.798 --> 00:29:00.358 line:15% 
but let's keep focused here.

647
00:29:02.038 --> 00:29:04.144
<v ->Abuses of power and dysfunctional government</v>

648
00:29:04.144 --> 00:29:06.677 line:15% 
is now the greatest threat to a...

649
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:13.370 line:15% 
a functioning, peaceful, world, alright,

650
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.450 line:15% 
and solving our problems.

651
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.013 line:15% 
And one way or another, that has got to be reformed.

652
00:29:19.013 --> 00:29:23.211 line:15% 
And it shouldn't shock anybody that the primary conduit

653
00:29:23.211 --> 00:29:24.902 line:15% 
of that reform is gonna be the net.

654
00:29:24.902 --> 00:29:27.558 line:15% 
But I'm not specifically talking about, necessarily,

655
00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:29.840 line:15% 
hacking and that kind of stuff.

656
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.877 line:15% 
The fact is that the internet is the greatest

657
00:29:31.877 --> 00:29:35.781 line:15% 
empowerment tool ever, and so, it's also,

658
00:29:35.781 --> 00:29:38.341 line:15% 
say, people coming together on websites

659
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:41.498 line:15% 
and having a million strong subscribing to a website

660
00:29:41.498 --> 00:29:44.037 line:15% 
that is designed to address secrecy reform,

661
00:29:44.037 --> 00:29:46.660 line:15% 
or forming secrecy reform Facebook groups

662
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.316 line:15% 
with a million members, and communicating with each other

663
00:29:49.316 --> 00:29:52.100 line:15% 
and raising funds online, and all the things you can do.

664
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.721 line:15% 
Forming political action committees, funding them

665
00:29:53.721 --> 00:29:55.673 line:15% 
through the net, all of this is possible.

666
00:29:55.673 --> 00:29:57.700 line:15% 
What really, we have not seen yet, and I'm not

667
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.219 line:15% 
criticizing people, because the net has only

668
00:30:01.219 --> 00:30:04.995 line:15% 
really been around in full force for about

669
00:30:04.995 --> 00:30:06.840 line:15% 
15, 16 years.

670
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.754 line:15% 
But we haven't even begun to use that resource.

671
00:30:10.754 --> 00:30:14.027 line:15% 
But people are figuring it out, and when I say people,

672
00:30:14.027 --> 00:30:17.152 line:15% 
remember, I forget how many people now are on the web,

673
00:30:17.152 --> 00:30:18.710 line:15% 
but I think we're starting to get up

674
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.654 line:15% 
in the two billion range, two, three billion.

675
00:30:21.654 --> 00:30:24.128 line:15% 
There's a half a million people on Facebook,

676
00:30:24.128 --> 00:30:27.935 line:15% 
that's growing, that'll be a billion within probably a year.

677
00:30:27.935 --> 00:30:30.453 line:15% 
And they're just starting to understand,

678
00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:32.469 line:15% 
"Oh, well, I can do that," or,

679
00:30:32.469 --> 00:30:35.274 line:15% 
"I can get on Skype and call people around the world

680
00:30:35.274 --> 00:30:37.514 line:15% 
"for practically nothing," or, "I can form an activist

681
00:30:37.514 --> 00:30:40.522 line:15% 
"thing," they're just starting to understand that.

682
00:30:40.522 --> 00:30:43.466 line:15% 
And then the mindset of, "Okay, now that we can do this,

683
00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:47.327 line:15% 
"let's come together, what is it that we want to do?"

684
00:30:47.327 --> 00:30:52.223 line:15% 
And so the future of activism

685
00:30:52.223 --> 00:30:57.125 line:15% 
is 10 million people contributing one dollar each

686
00:30:57.125 --> 00:31:02.072 line:15% 
to a website or an organization through the web,

687
00:31:02.072 --> 00:31:06.603 line:15% 
PayPal, one buck, with a design to go and address

688
00:31:06.603 --> 00:31:09.877 line:15% 
a major issue with the U.S. government, the U.K. government.

689
00:31:09.877 --> 00:31:11.477 line:15% 
Do you think those 10 million people are gonna

690
00:31:11.477 --> 00:31:12.470 line:15% 
miss the dollar?

691
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.677 line:15% 
No, do you think the 10 million dollars

692
00:31:14.677 --> 00:31:16.309 line:15% 
will be a really powerful thing?

693
00:31:16.309 --> 00:31:17.536 line:15% 
Absolutely.

694
00:31:17.536 --> 00:31:20.596 line:15% 
This is collective empowerment, which without the internet

695
00:31:20.596 --> 00:31:22.516 line:15% 
you really can't do.
<v Woman>That's true.</v>

696
00:31:22.516 --> 00:31:24.832 line:15% 
<v ->With the internet and the kinds of things like PayPal</v>

697
00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:26.453 line:15% 
that are developing, it's all doable.

698
00:31:26.453 --> 00:31:29.354 line:15% 
We're not there yet, but that will be part

699
00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.231 line:15% 
of this counter-insurgency.

700
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:34.751 line:15% 
And I do not think that governments can win this one.

701
00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:37.535 line:15% 
I think they have to lose here, and I think there are plenty

702
00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:39.455 line:15% 
of people in government that want to lose,

703
00:31:39.455 --> 00:31:40.872 line:15% 
meaning, you know, I know sorta how things are--

704
00:31:40.872 --> 00:31:42.174 line:15% 
<v Woman>It's hard to play this game anymore.</v>

705
00:31:42.174 --> 00:31:45.075 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I know how things are,</v>

706
00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:47.177 line:15% 
I know I'm sort of part of it, but I'd rather not be.

707
00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:49.352 line:15% 
So we have that, so I think they will kinda come over

708
00:31:49.352 --> 00:31:52.979 line:15% 
to our side, and that ultimately, we win this.

709
00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:55.795 line:15% 
For instance, I'll give you an example.

710
00:31:55.795 --> 00:31:58.408 line:15% 
I have a hunch about nine one one.

711
00:31:58.408 --> 00:32:01.331 line:15% 
It's not my area, and I don't get out there

712
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:03.304 line:15% 
and try to tell people what's going on.

713
00:32:03.304 --> 00:32:05.107 line:15% 
But I have a hunch that nine one one

714
00:32:05.107 --> 00:32:06.962 line:15% 
is gonna get resolved.

715
00:32:06.962 --> 00:32:09.789 line:15% 
We're gonna find out about that.

716
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:11.666 line:15% 
I think we're gonna win that one.

717
00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:15.111 line:15% 
Chemtrails, on chemtrails, initially,

718
00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:17.842 line:15% 
I had serious doubts anything was going on.

719
00:32:17.842 --> 00:32:20.146 line:15% 
After about five years, I'm starting to think,

720
00:32:20.146 --> 00:32:21.884 line:15% 
yes, something is going on.

721
00:32:21.884 --> 00:32:24.230 line:15% 
I have a feeling we're gonna win that one.

722
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.863 line:15% 
Alright, and that's gonna come out.

723
00:32:25.863 --> 00:32:28.604 line:15% 
The internet has changed the game, the equation.

724
00:32:28.604 --> 00:32:30.801 line:15% 
And so governments need to understand

725
00:32:30.801 --> 00:32:33.717 line:15% 
that you can do your thing, but you actually

726
00:32:33.717 --> 00:32:35.238 line:15% 
may be accountable for it.

727
00:32:35.238 --> 00:32:38.715 line:15% 
It's like these politicians who haven't figured that out,

728
00:32:38.715 --> 00:32:40.475 line:15% 
and they're going on camera, and they're saying

729
00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:42.235 line:15% 
some stupid thing that they would have gotten

730
00:32:42.235 --> 00:32:45.755 line:15% 
away with in 1985, but in the internet era

731
00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:48.229 line:15% 
it's on YouTube the next day, suddenly it's being

732
00:32:48.229 --> 00:32:50.352 line:15% 
investigated, they come up with some stupid response,

733
00:32:50.352 --> 00:32:52.154 line:15% 
and their political career is over in a week.

734
00:32:52.154 --> 00:32:53.637 line:15% 
It's like that.
<v Woman>It's getting harder</v>

735
00:32:53.637 --> 00:32:55.653 line:15% 
to spin it, with this much information available.

736
00:32:55.653 --> 00:32:59.130 line:15% 
<v ->So the collective power of a billion people</v>

737
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.831 line:15% 
focused through the net, right, even accounting

738
00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:05.071 line:15% 
for the fact that the net is still a Wild West

739
00:33:05.071 --> 00:33:06.671 line:15% 
and there's a lot of crazy stuff going on,

740
00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:08.335 line:15% 
but there are ways to filter, there are ways

741
00:33:08.335 --> 00:33:11.396 line:15% 
to cut through that, the impact of a billion people

742
00:33:11.396 --> 00:33:12.569 line:15% 
with that kind of power.

743
00:33:12.569 --> 00:33:15.075 line:15% 
Remember, the net is inexpensive.

744
00:33:15.075 --> 00:33:17.155 line:15% 
I mean, it's free in every library,

745
00:33:17.155 --> 00:33:18.915 line:15% 
you got build in wireless every computer.

746
00:33:18.915 --> 00:33:19.875 line:15% 
And so a kid's got a computer,

747
00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:21.368 line:15% 
he's got free internet access.

748
00:33:21.368 --> 00:33:24.633 line:15% 
So that power, when it starts to really have an impact,

749
00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:27.011 line:15% 
that's what makes me feel good about the 21st century,

750
00:33:27.011 --> 00:33:28.835 line:15% 
barring some really dumb thing,

751
00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:30.775 line:15% 
I think we can straighten this business out.

752
00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:33.026 line:15% 
And the net, again, worship it,

753
00:33:33.026 --> 00:33:36.429 line:15% 
it is the deus ex machina of our time.

754
00:33:36.429 --> 00:33:38.274 line:15% 
It is a gift from the cosmos,

755
00:33:38.274 --> 00:33:40.429 line:15% 
it's the greatest invention of all time.

756
00:33:40.429 --> 00:33:42.454 line:15% 
And I know there are some people who would like

757
00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:44.514 line:15% 
to go just live in a forest and get away from it all

758
00:33:44.514 --> 00:33:46.732 line:15% 
and have an organic garden, and I appreciate that.

759
00:33:46.732 --> 00:33:48.791 line:15% 
The thing is, I'm a tech guy, and some tech

760
00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:50.647 line:15% 
is good and some tech is bad.

761
00:33:50.647 --> 00:33:52.886 line:15% 
And the internet is the best thing

762
00:33:52.886 --> 00:33:54.529 line:15% 
that's ever come down upon you.

763
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:55.830 line:15% 
<v Woman>Well, Scott and I would agree with that,</v>

764
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.729 line:15% 
we're here talking to you, people are watching it

765
00:33:57.729 --> 00:33:59.553 line:15% 
on the net, so you're preaching to the choir here,

766
00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:00.790 line:15% 
but I agree with you, I agree with you.

767
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.091 line:15% 
<v ->But I want that message out there</v>

768
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.370 line:15% 
because there's a lot of people that are

769
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.613 line:15% 
on the net right now and have no idea what they could do.

770
00:34:06.613 --> 00:34:09.227 line:15% 
<v Woman>Point very well made, and I hope it's registering</v>

771
00:34:09.227 --> 00:34:11.605 line:15% 
with everybody out there who has a heart

772
00:34:11.605 --> 00:34:13.664 line:15% 
that's willing to do something.

773
00:34:13.664 --> 00:34:15.530 line:15% 
Meanwhile, what about this whole, we're talking

774
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.840 line:15% 
going back into the whole disclosure subject specifically,

775
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.717 line:15% 
and we're talking about another major influence

776
00:34:20.717 --> 00:34:24.322 line:15% 
besides the net, is Hollywood, and what has Hollywood

777
00:34:24.322 --> 00:34:26.402 line:15% 
been doing with this subject and why?

778
00:34:26.402 --> 00:34:30.401 line:15% 
And who's orchestrating that and what do you see

779
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.067 line:15% 
happening down the road?

780
00:34:32.067 --> 00:34:34.840 line:15% 
Well some of those bubbles in that about-to-boil pot

781
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.466 line:15% 
I mentioned, are Hollywood, entertainment world,

782
00:34:38.466 --> 00:34:40.002 line:15% 
television, movies.

783
00:34:40.002 --> 00:34:42.882 line:15% 
Not surprising, as we move closer and closer

784
00:34:42.882 --> 00:34:44.962 line:15% 
to the disclosure event.
<v Woman>And most of us</v>

785
00:34:44.962 --> 00:34:47.127 line:15% 
negatively...
<v ->I would like to,</v>

786
00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:48.940 line:15% 
we'll just comment on that, I'll comment on that.

787
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.746 line:15% 
Not surprisingly, Hollywood is going alien,

788
00:34:52.746 --> 00:34:54.592 line:15% 
I mean, we knew this was gonna happen.

789
00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:56.565 line:15% 
They've always been in the subject,

790
00:34:56.565 --> 00:34:58.229 line:15% 
they've made tons of money, billions, and billions

791
00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:00.692 line:15% 
of dollars off of extra-terrestrial related.

792
00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:02.132 line:15% 
<v Woman>The Day the Earth Stood Still .</v>

793
00:35:02.132 --> 00:35:04.127 line:15% 
<v ->Right, all the way back to the 50s.</v>

794
00:35:04.127 --> 00:35:07.124 line:15% 
But it's only grown, and grown, and grown .

795
00:35:07.124 --> 00:35:10.452 line:15% 
Some of the most notable movies we know,

796
00:35:10.452 --> 00:35:13.609 line:15% 
they're virtually legends, 2001: A Space Odyssey,

797
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:15.529 line:15% 
E.T.
<v Woman>Close Encounters</v>

798
00:35:15.529 --> 00:35:18.110 line:15% 
<v ->You know, extra-terrestrials for everybody, right?</v>

799
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.512 line:15% 
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

800
00:35:21.512 --> 00:35:25.150 line:15% 
and let's not forget that massive 20-hour miniseries

801
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.371 line:15% 
by Stephen Spielberg, Taken, which is about abduction,

802
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:32.168 line:15% 
and a sort of theatrical history of UFO truth embargo.

803
00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:34.066 line:15% 
A lot of people have forgotten about that,

804
00:35:34.066 --> 00:35:35.709 line:15% 
it's still out there.

805
00:35:35.709 --> 00:35:39.410 line:15% 
But then, and then one television show after another

806
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.703 line:15% 
with alien themes, many of them have already come and gone,

807
00:35:41.703 --> 00:35:42.727 line:15% 
they didn't work.

808
00:35:42.727 --> 00:35:44.007 line:15% 
There's six more in the pipeline right now.

809
00:35:44.007 --> 00:35:45.671 line:15% 
<v Woman>Mork and Mindy. (laughs)</v>

810
00:35:45.671 --> 00:35:47.666 line:15% 
<v ->Even Mork and Mindy, though that dates.</v>

811
00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:49.617 line:15% 
You know, you just dated yourself.

812
00:35:50.927 --> 00:35:55.336 line:15% 
And then the movies, and then I guess that the perfect

813
00:35:55.336 --> 00:35:59.607 line:15% 
symbol for Hollywood's embracing

814
00:35:59.607 --> 00:36:02.068 line:15% 
of this is, of course, Avatar.

815
00:36:02.068 --> 00:36:04.426 line:15% 
Avatar comes out, and let's not forget,

816
00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:07.647 line:15% 
it's about extra-terrestrials, okay?

817
00:36:07.647 --> 00:36:10.644 line:15% 
Admittedly, they're ectomorphic, blue, really good-looking

818
00:36:10.644 --> 00:36:12.286 line:15% 
extra-terrestrials, but the point is,

819
00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:13.822 line:15% 
it's about extra-terrestrials.

820
00:36:13.822 --> 00:36:16.084 line:15% 
And it doesn't do well,

821
00:36:16.084 --> 00:36:19.966 line:15% 
it does two point seven billion dollars well, alright?

822
00:36:19.966 --> 00:36:23.966 line:15% 
And I admit that the previous world record

823
00:36:23.966 --> 00:36:27.987 line:15% 
was not an E.T. movie, it was about the Titanic,

824
00:36:27.987 --> 00:36:29.907 line:15% 
which was a sinking ship, and that did well

825
00:36:29.907 --> 00:36:31.784 line:15% 
because I think all Americans can relate

826
00:36:31.784 --> 00:36:34.408 line:15% 
to a sinking ship, if you know what I mean.

827
00:36:34.408 --> 00:36:37.341 line:15% 
But, no one should be shocked that the highest grossing

828
00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:39.805 line:15% 
movie by a wide margin of almost a billion dollars

829
00:36:39.805 --> 00:36:41.489 line:15% 
is about extra-terrestrials.

830
00:36:41.489 --> 00:36:43.303 line:15% 
And there's more films in the works.

831
00:36:43.303 --> 00:36:45.980 line:15% 
<v Woman>And people were very sympathetic to that message,</v>

832
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.284 line:15% 
and it's message regarding the Earth itself.

833
00:36:48.284 --> 00:36:49.724 line:15% 
<v ->Well, there's two things going on here.</v>

834
00:36:49.724 --> 00:36:51.868 line:15% 
Without getting into the negatives and positives,

835
00:36:51.868 --> 00:36:54.748 line:15% 
nobody should be surprised that a lot of these E.T.

836
00:36:54.748 --> 00:36:56.188 line:15% 
movies are scary.

837
00:36:56.188 --> 00:36:58.065 line:15% 
It's just like horror movies, right?

838
00:36:58.065 --> 00:37:00.625 line:15% 
But there also are positive E.T. movies.

839
00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:03.163 line:15% 
I mentioned some, Starman, there have been plenty of them.

840
00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:05.627 line:15% 
What's important here, and what I need to convey

841
00:37:05.627 --> 00:37:08.304 line:15% 
to your viewers is this,

842
00:37:08.304 --> 00:37:11.067 line:15% 
the people in this town are smart people.

843
00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:14.224 line:15% 
They're wealthy, they're connected politically, right?

844
00:37:14.224 --> 00:37:15.481 line:15% 
I mean, everybody knows that Hollywood

845
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:17.444 line:15% 
has got big political connections now.

846
00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:20.825 line:15% 
So the idea that the Hollywood moguls, and producers,

847
00:37:20.825 --> 00:37:23.651 line:15% 
and high-end directors don't know or haven't figured out

848
00:37:23.651 --> 00:37:26.190 line:15% 
personally the E.T. presence is real, come on.

849
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.566 line:15% 
They know it's real.

850
00:37:27.566 --> 00:37:30.648 line:15% 
And so they understand the importance of this subject,

851
00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:33.570 line:15% 
and so that helps to ensure that they're going to engage it.

852
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:35.747 line:15% 
But more importantly, here's the dynamic

853
00:37:35.747 --> 00:37:37.724 line:15% 
that's operating here.

854
00:37:38.871 --> 00:37:41.676 line:15% 
As the polls have shown, 50% of the American people,

855
00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:43.786 line:15% 
let's just talk about America, but this is true for most

856
00:37:43.786 --> 00:37:45.290 line:15% 
of the first world countries.

857
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.378 line:15% 
50% of the American people believe privately

858
00:37:48.378 --> 00:37:50.982 line:15% 
when polled, that the UFO phenomenon is,

859
00:37:50.982 --> 00:37:52.602 line:15% 
in part, extra-terrestrial.

860
00:37:52.602 --> 00:37:56.624 line:15% 
And 80 to 90% consistently will tell you under poll,

861
00:37:56.624 --> 00:37:58.452 line:15% 
in polling, that the government

862
00:37:58.452 --> 00:38:00.090 line:15% 
is not telling the truth about this,

863
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.405 line:15% 
but, as we know, it's still embargoed.

864
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:05.669 line:15% 
So, you sort of know that E.T.s are here,

865
00:38:05.669 --> 00:38:07.887 line:15% 
you know you don't know the full truth about it,

866
00:38:07.887 --> 00:38:09.188 line:15% 
but what can you do about it?

867
00:38:09.188 --> 00:38:11.226 line:15% 
You can't, but still, it's there.

868
00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:13.284 line:15% 
So Hollywood comes along, and makes movies

869
00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:15.908 line:15% 
about extra-terrestrials, and so when you go

870
00:38:15.908 --> 00:38:17.348 line:15% 
to those movies, this is your way

871
00:38:17.348 --> 00:38:18.905 line:15% 
of connecting to the issue.

872
00:38:18.905 --> 00:38:20.569 line:15% 
You can't get the truth from the government,

873
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:23.150 line:15% 
but you can experience it in the movie theater,

874
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.707 line:15% 
or in front of your television.

875
00:38:24.707 --> 00:38:28.846 line:15% 
That's why billions of dollars are flowing into this town.

876
00:38:28.846 --> 00:38:30.766 line:15% 
<v Woman>Interesting, yes, that makes total sense.</v>

877
00:38:30.766 --> 00:38:32.888 line:15% 
<v ->From the subject, not simply because, "Oh gee,</v>

878
00:38:32.888 --> 00:38:34.723 line:15% 
"E.T.s are a cool subject."

879
00:38:34.723 --> 00:38:38.403 line:15% 
There is no other genre that generates this kind of money.

880
00:38:38.403 --> 00:38:41.591 line:15% 
Now they're feasting on, essentially, this extraordinary

881
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:43.586 line:15% 
event in human history that's taking place.

882
00:38:43.586 --> 00:38:44.749 line:15% 
I don't blame them.

883
00:38:44.749 --> 00:38:48.205 line:15% 
I kind of wish some of those billions of dollars,

884
00:38:48.205 --> 00:38:51.350 line:15% 
just a little bit, that's pouring in to Hollywood,

885
00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:55.892 line:15% 
and into other entertainment areas

886
00:38:55.892 --> 00:38:59.094 line:15% 
around the US, some of it might come back to the advocacy

887
00:38:59.094 --> 00:39:01.249 line:15% 
work, to the people that are trying to get the government

888
00:39:01.249 --> 00:39:02.870 line:15% 
to end this embargo.
<v Woman>The real deal, yeah.</v>

889
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:04.075 line:15% 
<v ->And that just hasn't happened,</v>

890
00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.792 line:15% 
and I think it's unfortunate.

891
00:39:05.792 --> 00:39:08.832 line:15% 
But in any event, without question,

892
00:39:08.832 --> 00:39:12.853 line:15% 
all of these movies have served to advance the issue,

893
00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:16.426 line:15% 
raise public awareness of the E.T. reality

894
00:39:16.426 --> 00:39:19.893 line:15% 
to virtually 100%, which is a phenomenal thing.

895
00:39:19.893 --> 00:39:21.610 line:15% 
I mean, if you were a business, and had a product,

896
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.445 line:15% 
and you had 100% recognition of that product in public?

897
00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.153 line:15% 
You'll make a fortune.

898
00:39:26.153 --> 00:39:28.190 line:15% 
So, as I've said many times, you can go out

899
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.689 line:15% 
on the street right now, and you can interview 100 people,

900
00:39:31.689 --> 00:39:33.449 line:15% 
and 40 of them will be able to tell you

901
00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:36.308 line:15% 
who the Vice President is, but 100 of them

902
00:39:36.308 --> 00:39:39.347 line:15% 
will know what you're talking about if you say UFO,

903
00:39:39.347 --> 00:39:40.691 line:15% 
or extra-terrestrial.

904
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:42.825 line:15% 
So, Hollywood has helped ensure we have 100 percent

905
00:39:42.825 --> 00:39:44.648 line:15% 
awareness of this issue.

906
00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.664 line:15% 
That kind of makes it that much more difficult

907
00:39:46.664 --> 00:39:49.864 line:15% 
for the government to continue to maintain a truth embargo.

908
00:39:49.864 --> 00:39:52.371 line:15% 
So Hollywood has definitely helped drive the process,

909
00:39:52.371 --> 00:39:54.205 line:15% 
and that's a good thing.

910
00:39:54.205 --> 00:39:59.058 line:15% 
Now, we can get into, those of us

911
00:39:59.058 --> 00:40:02.752 line:15% 
that know a great deal about the UFO-E.T. reality,

912
00:40:02.752 --> 00:40:05.686 line:15% 
naturally, are going to be sensitive to the content.

913
00:40:05.686 --> 00:40:09.451 line:15% 
And so if you know a lot about the contactee's experiences,

914
00:40:09.451 --> 00:40:10.911 line:15% 
and you talked to many of them,

915
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.490 line:15% 
and you're familiar with the research,

916
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.346 line:15% 
and you go see a movie like The Fourth Kind,

917
00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:17.205 line:15% 
which is a very over-dramatic, hyperbolic,

918
00:40:17.205 --> 00:40:21.631 line:15% 
misrepresentational approach, it's easy to get

919
00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:23.870 line:15% 
a little upset about that.

920
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.879 line:15% 
But, on the other hand,

921
00:40:26.879 --> 00:40:29.822 line:15% 
there is contact going on,

922
00:40:29.822 --> 00:40:32.255 line:15% 
there are abductions taking place,

923
00:40:32.255 --> 00:40:36.297 line:15% 
and that movie is somewhat reflective of that, and so,

924
00:40:36.297 --> 00:40:38.836 line:15% 
my thinking is, "Hey, you have a right to do that,

925
00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.734 line:15% 
"but over here, somebody else will do a movie,

926
00:40:40.734 --> 00:40:42.100 line:15% 
"and they're going to do that."

927
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.198 line:15% 
<v Woman>So it all drives awareness.</v>

928
00:40:43.198 --> 00:40:44.553 line:15% 
<v ->Where they address it in different way.</v>

929
00:40:44.553 --> 00:40:47.565 line:15% 
But, it's all part, and this is reasonable, and of course,

930
00:40:47.565 --> 00:40:49.922 line:15% 
you know our movies are exported around the world.

931
00:40:49.922 --> 00:40:51.501 line:15% 
And so Hollywood hasn't just raised the awareness

932
00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:53.677 line:15% 
of the U.S. citizens, it's raised world awareness.

933
00:40:53.677 --> 00:40:55.265 line:15% 
I don't know what it is, but worldwide,

934
00:40:55.265 --> 00:40:57.527 line:15% 
it's probably up in the 80 percent.

935
00:40:57.527 --> 00:41:00.524 line:15% 
That means 80 percent of six point four billion people

936
00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:03.244 line:15% 
are aware of the E.T. and UFO issue.

937
00:41:03.244 --> 00:41:05.825 line:15% 
That's where we are today, and that's why the truth embargo,

938
00:41:05.825 --> 00:41:08.023 line:15% 
of course, will end, and has to end.

939
00:41:08.023 --> 00:41:10.945 line:15% 
<v Woman>Anything you want to add to that,</v>

940
00:41:10.945 --> 00:41:14.326 line:15% 
in terms of the people watching this right now,

941
00:41:14.326 --> 00:41:16.961 line:15% 
in terms of what you, if they're interested in this,

942
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:18.966 line:15% 
and feel compelled to do so,

943
00:41:18.966 --> 00:41:22.944 line:15% 
what are some things they can do from their computer?

944
00:41:22.944 --> 00:41:24.272 line:15% 
<v ->Well.</v>

945
00:41:24.272 --> 00:41:26.523 line:15% 
<v Woman>I know they can come to your group and support you</v>

946
00:41:26.523 --> 00:41:29.509 line:15% 
because you're one of the only real political

947
00:41:29.509 --> 00:41:31.866 line:15% 
activist groups out there, and I do understand that,

948
00:41:31.866 --> 00:41:34.351 line:15% 
so that's one way to go, is to help support your work,

949
00:41:34.351 --> 00:41:36.645 line:15% 
what are some other things they can do?

950
00:41:36.645 --> 00:41:40.687 line:15% 
<v ->Well, first and foremost, people need to increase</v>

951
00:41:40.687 --> 00:41:44.186 line:15% 
their understanding of what's happening around them

952
00:41:44.186 --> 00:41:46.042 line:15% 
with respect to this issue.

953
00:41:46.042 --> 00:41:50.084 line:15% 
They need to make some effort to try to get up to speed

954
00:41:50.084 --> 00:41:52.270 line:15% 
on this disclosure process.

955
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.870 line:15% 
<v Woman>And you have a massive number,</v>

956
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.769 line:15% 
I just wanted to say this, you have a massive amount

957
00:41:55.769 --> 00:41:56.910 line:15% 
of information on your site,

958
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.009 line:15% 
because that's what you've been doing,

959
00:41:58.009 --> 00:41:59.385 line:15% 
is compiling...
<v ->There are many big sites</v>

960
00:41:59.385 --> 00:42:02.201 line:15% 
out there, if you were to go and google exo-politics,

961
00:42:02.201 --> 00:42:03.715 line:15% 
you'll get tons of sites.

962
00:42:03.715 --> 00:42:05.742 line:15% 
If you google UFO, you get tons of sites.

963
00:42:05.742 --> 00:42:08.877 line:15% 
But my site, Paradigm Research Group,

964
00:42:08.877 --> 00:42:11.661 line:15% 
is designed to have thousands of links outward.

965
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:13.080 line:15% 
But to the extent that people

966
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.264 line:15% 
are going to be a little more aware,

967
00:42:14.264 --> 00:42:15.767 line:15% 
this is going to serve them well,

968
00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:17.720 line:15% 
because this is a big deal coming,

969
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.826 line:15% 
and a little foreknowledge won't hurt, right?

970
00:42:20.826 --> 00:42:22.336 line:15% 
And that will be helpful,

971
00:42:22.336 --> 00:42:25.279 line:15% 
because it's to all of our best interests

972
00:42:25.279 --> 00:42:27.306 line:15% 
that the post-disclosure world,

973
00:42:27.306 --> 00:42:30.026 line:15% 
which starts five seconds after

974
00:42:30.026 --> 00:42:33.300 line:15% 
a world leader announces that the E.T. presence is real,

975
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.521 line:15% 
go well, I mean, we want people to conduct themselves well,

976
00:42:36.521 --> 00:42:39.902 line:15% 
we want to see some policy changes,

977
00:42:39.902 --> 00:42:41.246 line:15% 
we want to see some things happen,

978
00:42:41.246 --> 00:42:43.860 line:15% 
we don't want to see hyperbolic behavior.

979
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.385 line:15% 
So a little foreknowledge will help there.

980
00:42:45.385 --> 00:42:46.605 line:15% 
That's the first thing they could do.

981
00:42:46.605 --> 00:42:49.771 line:15% 
Secondly, they certainly can...

982
00:42:52.017 --> 00:42:53.777 line:15% 
get in touch with their representatives,

983
00:42:53.777 --> 00:42:55.781 line:15% 
and their politicians, some of their media.

984
00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:57.904 line:15% 
They can make comments in articles that appear on the net,

985
00:42:57.904 --> 00:43:00.534 line:15% 
or whatever, about their thoughts on this,

986
00:43:00.534 --> 00:43:02.709 line:15% 
and sort of state what they feel about this,

987
00:43:02.709 --> 00:43:05.600 line:15% 
and they can react to negative, or ridiculous

988
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.893 line:15% 
media coverage, or silliness coming out

989
00:43:07.893 --> 00:43:09.951 line:15% 
of government on this,

990
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:12.820 line:15% 
they can do that, they can become somewhat proactive.

991
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.506 line:15% 
We definitely could use some of these people

992
00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:20.367 line:15% 
who are blessed through their hard work

993
00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:23.951 line:15% 
with substantial resources to maybe step forward,

994
00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:26.372 line:15% 
and help to fund the advocacy work,

995
00:43:26.372 --> 00:43:27.812 line:15% 
because we are in a sense,

996
00:43:27.812 --> 00:43:29.689 line:15% 
the disclosure movement is not simply

997
00:43:29.689 --> 00:43:30.947 line:15% 
an advocacy for disclosure,

998
00:43:30.947 --> 00:43:33.209 line:15% 
it is an advocacy for the people's interest.

999
00:43:33.209 --> 00:43:37.561 line:15% 
We are citizens engaging the government on this issue.

1000
00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:40.323 line:15% 
And to the extent that we can have significant

1001
00:43:40.323 --> 00:43:42.819
financial support, we can best represent the people--

1002
00:43:42.819 --> 00:43:44.483
<v Woman>And it's true, people like yourself,</v>

1003
00:43:44.483 --> 00:43:47.886 line:15% 
doing this kind of work tirelessly for decades

1004
00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:50.965 line:15% 
have been operating on frayed, shoestring budgets.

1005
00:43:50.965 --> 00:43:53.109 line:15% 
<v ->No, it's the least funded major activist movement</v>

1006
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:55.189 line:15% 
in history, but there is a reason.

1007
00:43:55.189 --> 00:43:57.930 line:15% 
Unlike any other activist movement

1008
00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.765 line:15% 
you can refer to historically,

1009
00:43:59.765 --> 00:44:01.769 line:15% 
this issue, remember, was embargoed.

1010
00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:04.287 line:15% 
There was then a great deal of effort from the government

1011
00:44:04.287 --> 00:44:06.282 line:15% 
to tell people, "You can't, stay away from that,

1012
00:44:06.282 --> 00:44:08.980 line:15% 
"you can't go there, it's not in your best interest."

1013
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.905 line:15% 
And so, where normally the power of the issue would invite

1014
00:44:12.905 --> 00:44:14.985 line:15% 
in a substantial amount of financial support,

1015
00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.286 line:15% 
it isn't there.

1016
00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:19.883 line:15% 
So people have to, sort of, get through that barrier,

1017
00:44:19.883 --> 00:44:22.592 line:15% 
that ridicule curtain, and say, "No, no, no,

1018
00:44:22.592 --> 00:44:24.331 line:15% 
"this is important, I'll fund it."

1019
00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:28.032 line:15% 
I should point out that the risk of supporting this work,

1020
00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:30.827 line:15% 
engaging this work are far, far less

1021
00:44:30.827 --> 00:44:32.404 line:15% 
than they were in past times.

1022
00:44:32.404 --> 00:44:35.783 line:15% 
This is not 1960, 1980, 1990, there's been almost no,

1023
00:44:35.783 --> 00:44:39.771 line:15% 
what I would call nastiness,

1024
00:44:39.771 --> 00:44:42.128 line:15% 
since the year 2000.

1025
00:44:42.128 --> 00:44:43.345 line:15% 
Now there are some issues out there

1026
00:44:43.345 --> 00:44:45.606 line:15% 
where nastiness still goes on, but not this one.

1027
00:44:45.606 --> 00:44:48.230 line:15% 
And obviously the attitudes of the public have changed,

1028
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.306 line:15% 
media is covering it, again, thousands of articles,

1029
00:44:51.306 --> 00:44:54.956 line:15% 
and so the idea that somebody could not provide

1030
00:44:54.956 --> 00:44:56.902 line:15% 
a substantial financial support for this work

1031
00:44:56.902 --> 00:45:00.022 line:15% 
and was going to somehow suffer some huge embarrassment,

1032
00:45:00.022 --> 00:45:02.446 line:15% 
or be ridiculed, that's really minimal now.

1033
00:45:02.446 --> 00:45:04.866 line:15% 
And so I don't think the barriers are there,

1034
00:45:04.866 --> 00:45:07.346 line:15% 
but they're perceived to be there.

1035
00:45:07.346 --> 00:45:09.266 line:15% 
So obviously, we are looking for that,

1036
00:45:09.266 --> 00:45:11.166 line:15% 
if it's possible.

1037
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:15.728 line:15% 
And in general, every conference

1038
00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:18.208 line:15% 
that someone attends, every publication they buy

1039
00:45:18.208 --> 00:45:21.048 line:15% 
or subscribe to provides a little resource to this.

1040
00:45:21.048 --> 00:45:22.930 line:15% 
And these are the things they could do.

1041
00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.350 line:15% 
Now, in the Paradigm Research Group's world,

1042
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.550 line:15% 
there are some very specific things

1043
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.110 line:15% 
'cause we have ongoing projects.

1044
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.890 line:15% 
One, Facts on Washington, this is new

1045
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.930 line:15% 
since we interviewed before.

1046
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.292 line:15% 
The Facts on Washington dot org has been a,

1047
00:45:36.292 --> 00:45:39.152 line:15% 
it goes back to November the 5th of 2008,

1048
00:45:39.152 --> 00:45:41.812 line:15% 
so we're talking now two years,

1049
00:45:41.812 --> 00:45:44.352 line:15% 
was set up specifically to direct letters, faxes,

1050
00:45:44.352 --> 00:45:47.751 line:15% 
and emails to the government about this issue.

1051
00:45:47.751 --> 00:45:50.472 line:15% 
Now the target was the President Elect,

1052
00:45:50.472 --> 00:45:53.472 line:15% 
which was Barack Obama, and a lot of mail

1053
00:45:53.472 --> 00:45:54.952 line:15% 
and faxes were sent and emails were sent

1054
00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.772 line:15% 
to the transition headquarters.

1055
00:45:56.772 --> 00:46:00.832 line:15% 
After he took office, from June 20 to June the 1st,

1056
00:46:00.832 --> 00:46:02.912 line:15% 
it was then directed at the White House.

1057
00:46:02.912 --> 00:46:05.432 line:15% 
But since June the 1st, the Facts on Washington dot org

1058
00:46:05.432 --> 00:46:09.792 line:15% 
website is where you go now to see how you can

1059
00:46:09.792 --> 00:46:13.232 line:15% 
send a letter to the White House Press Corps

1060
00:46:13.232 --> 00:46:15.092 line:15% 
through their association, it's called the White House

1061
00:46:15.092 --> 00:46:16.712 line:15% 
Correspondence Association.

1062
00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:19.612 line:15% 
And so since June 1st of 2009, we have been directing

1063
00:46:19.612 --> 00:46:22.532 line:15% 
letters, faxes and emails to those reporters,

1064
00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:25.852 line:15% 
and this is very important, this is a wedge approach,

1065
00:46:25.852 --> 00:46:27.292 line:15% 
that, "Isn't it time you started asking

1066
00:46:27.292 --> 00:46:29.212 line:15% 
"the obvious questions,"
<v Woman>Very good.</v>

1067
00:46:29.212 --> 00:46:30.252 line:15% 
<v ->"the tough questions?</v>

1068
00:46:30.252 --> 00:46:31.892 line:15% 
"Isn't it time you started doing your job?

1069
00:46:31.892 --> 00:46:35.632 line:15% 
"This is a free speech country, right?

1070
00:46:35.632 --> 00:46:37.672 line:15% 
"And isn't it time you backed up your colleagues,

1071
00:46:37.672 --> 00:46:39.632 line:15% 
"so if one of your colleagues ask a question

1072
00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:41.992 line:15% 
"on this issue and gets a laugh from the podium,

1073
00:46:41.992 --> 00:46:43.992 line:15% 
"you stand up behind them, and say,

1074
00:46:43.992 --> 00:46:45.652 line:15% 
""Why don't you answer it?"

1075
00:46:45.652 --> 00:46:47.212 line:15% 
"Okay, in other words, why don't you do your job?"

1076
00:46:47.212 --> 00:46:48.792 line:15% 
So that's the Facts on Washington, so go to Facts

1077
00:46:48.792 --> 00:46:52.652 line:15% 
on Washington dot org and participate.

1078
00:46:52.652 --> 00:46:55.372 line:15% 
The other is the exo-politics world network,

1079
00:46:55.372 --> 00:46:57.372 line:15% 
of which I am probably the most proud.

1080
00:46:57.372 --> 00:47:00.112 line:15% 
This was launched in early 2008.

1081
00:47:00.112 --> 00:47:02.472 line:15% 
The website is Exo Politics World dot net.

1082
00:47:02.472 --> 00:47:04.192 line:15% 
And there's two things going on there.

1083
00:47:04.192 --> 00:47:08.392 line:15% 
First, we're trying to build a network of sites,

1084
00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:12.431 line:15% 
one per country, that is the portal for exo-politics

1085
00:47:12.431 --> 00:47:15.172 line:15% 
for that country, alright, or a portal.

1086
00:47:15.172 --> 00:47:17.132 line:15% 
Right now we'd be like 24, and more

1087
00:47:17.132 --> 00:47:18.752 line:15% 
are coming online soon.

1088
00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:21.652 line:15% 
And we're knitting them together

1089
00:47:21.652 --> 00:47:25.336 line:15% 
through naming protocol, so that sites are named

1090
00:47:25.336 --> 00:47:27.816 line:15% 
exo-politics United States, exo-politics France,

1091
00:47:27.816 --> 00:47:29.936 line:15% 
exo-politics, Germany, alright?

1092
00:47:29.936 --> 00:47:31.576 line:15% 
And that creates a network.

1093
00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:34.476 line:15% 
And then also the web address, the URLs,

1094
00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:38.836 line:15% 
the URLs, so most of the addresses are consistent

1095
00:47:38.836 --> 00:47:42.016 line:15% 
in this way, exo-politics United States dot US,

1096
00:47:42.016 --> 00:47:45.416 line:15% 
exo-politics France dot FR, okay?

1097
00:47:45.416 --> 00:47:48.796 line:15% 
And so we're creating this perceived network on the net,

1098
00:47:48.796 --> 00:47:52.016 line:15% 
on the web, of countries engaging the issue.

1099
00:47:52.016 --> 00:47:53.976 line:15% 
And they're cross-connecting with each other

1100
00:47:53.976 --> 00:47:55.596 line:15% 
and promoting each other.

1101
00:47:55.596 --> 00:47:57.276 line:15% 
And that's the exo-politics world network,

1102
00:47:57.276 --> 00:47:58.255 line:15% 
and it's growing.

1103
00:47:58.255 --> 00:47:59.896 line:15% 
Our goal would be about 50 to 100 countries,

1104
00:47:59.896 --> 00:48:01.816 line:15% 
that'd be fantastic, we're up to about 25.

1105
00:48:01.816 --> 00:48:05.716 line:15% 
Now just a few months ago, five months ago,

1106
00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:09.755 line:15% 
I announced from Budapest, on my last European tour,

1107
00:48:09.755 --> 00:48:12.656 line:15% 
that the next phase of the exo-politics world network,

1108
00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:15.996 line:15% 
which is the exo-politics cities initiative,

1109
00:48:15.996 --> 00:48:17.996 line:15% 
world network cities initiative.

1110
00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:19.896 line:15% 
What is it?
Simple.

1111
00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:23.675 line:15% 
Anyone who wants to set up an exo-politics talking group,

1112
00:48:23.675 --> 00:48:27.656 line:15% 
think, you know, book club.
<v Woman>Wouldn't be boring.</v>

1113
00:48:27.656 --> 00:48:31.016 line:15% 
<v ->Definitely not, meaning, I hold a regular meeting</v>

1114
00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:33.516 line:15% 
at my home, at the library, whatever,

1115
00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:34.996 line:15% 
for people to come in, say, once a month,

1116
00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:37.056 line:15% 
whenever, to talk about this issue.

1117
00:48:37.056 --> 00:48:39.555 line:15% 
You can register with the exo-politics world network

1118
00:48:39.555 --> 00:48:41.136 line:15% 
cities initiative.
<v Woman>Very good.</v>

1119
00:48:41.136 --> 00:48:43.255 line:15% 
<v ->And what we do is we put it up there,</v>

1120
00:48:43.255 --> 00:48:45.616 line:15% 
we put up exo-politics Los Angeles,

1121
00:48:45.616 --> 00:48:47.396 line:15% 
exo-politics Amsterdam,

1122
00:48:47.396 --> 00:48:50.896 line:15% 
and then the email of the host.

1123
00:48:50.896 --> 00:48:54.036 line:15% 
And we're already are putting those up, we're about 20.

1124
00:48:54.036 --> 00:48:56.256 line:15% 
And how many?
We could have thousands.

1125
00:48:56.256 --> 00:48:59.815 line:15% 
And so, no big deal, it's just a talking group.

1126
00:48:59.815 --> 00:49:02.735 line:15% 
No board of directors, no bylaws,

1127
00:49:02.735 --> 00:49:07.415 line:15% 
no rules, just a talking group, listed on that network.

1128
00:49:07.415 --> 00:49:09.736 line:15% 
Now, soon you'll be able to go there and say,

1129
00:49:09.736 --> 00:49:11.415 line:15% 
"Is there a group in my town?"

1130
00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.175 line:15% 
And then you can contact them and join up.

1131
00:49:13.175 --> 00:49:17.336 line:15% 
And so we're trying to build this grassroots discussion

1132
00:49:17.336 --> 00:49:20.535 line:15% 
out there through just a website, very simple,

1133
00:49:20.535 --> 00:49:22.696 line:15% 
very basic, but yet extremely effective

1134
00:49:22.696 --> 00:49:24.035 line:15% 
if people participate.

1135
00:49:24.035 --> 00:49:27.055 line:15% 
And so that's another way people can get involved.

1136
00:49:27.055 --> 00:49:28.755 line:15% 
And there are others, I'm sure.

1137
00:49:28.755 --> 00:49:30.135 line:15% 
<v Woman>Yes, well, and once you start going</v>

1138
00:49:30.135 --> 00:49:31.695 line:15% 
down that rabbit hole, you'll find a lot of ways.

1139
00:49:31.695 --> 00:49:33.995 line:15% 
But what you're doing, I like that,

1140
00:49:33.995 --> 00:49:36.335 line:15% 
I like these, the last two you just brought up,

1141
00:49:36.335 --> 00:49:39.315 line:15% 
the exo-politics and the one previously--

1142
00:49:39.315 --> 00:49:41.335 line:15% 
<v ->The world network and the cities initiative,</v>

1143
00:49:41.335 --> 00:49:43.835 line:15% 
talking groups, portals of websites.

1144
00:49:43.835 --> 00:49:47.036 line:15% 
Now exo-politics is the term, we didn't discuss this,

1145
00:49:47.036 --> 00:49:50.415 line:15% 
but exo-politics is the term that now is used to,

1146
00:49:50.415 --> 00:49:55.095 line:15% 
I think, harbor the citizen engagement of this issue,

1147
00:49:55.095 --> 00:49:57.336 line:15% 
the socio-political engagement of this issue.

1148
00:49:57.336 --> 00:50:00.035 line:15% 
It's not euphology, it's not a science,

1149
00:50:00.035 --> 00:50:02.235 line:15% 
it covers a lot of things, right?

1150
00:50:02.235 --> 00:50:06.135 line:15% 
But it's basically politics addressing the ET issue

1151
00:50:06.135 --> 00:50:08.915 line:15% 
in every form and fashion, that's why it's exo-politics.

1152
00:50:08.915 --> 00:50:10.995 line:15% 
Some people are offended by the term.

1153
00:50:10.995 --> 00:50:13.855 line:15% 
But we need a term, we need a nomenclature here,

1154
00:50:13.855 --> 00:50:15.675 line:15% 
and that's pretty much it.

1155
00:50:15.675 --> 00:50:18.915 line:15% 
And I think it will be a word in the dictionary very soon,

1156
00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:20.775 line:15% 
and I think it will be the established phrase.

1157
00:50:20.775 --> 00:50:23.655 line:15% 
So it's, I'm an exo-political activist,

1158
00:50:23.655 --> 00:50:25.355 line:15% 
this is an exo-political movement,

1159
00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:27.915 line:15% 
the disclosure movement.

1160
00:50:27.915 --> 00:50:31.455 line:15% 
And everyone can join, it's global.

1161
00:50:31.455 --> 00:50:35.195 line:15% 
The ET engagement of this planet is global,

1162
00:50:35.195 --> 00:50:38.095 line:15% 
it's not about a particular nation, race, religion.

1163
00:50:38.095 --> 00:50:41.675 line:15% 
They're engaging all of us, and all of our futures

1164
00:50:41.675 --> 00:50:44.255 line:15% 
are being shaped by this.

1165
00:50:44.255 --> 00:50:46.296 line:15% 
And I'll leave you with this.

1166
00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:48.835 line:15% 
One of the neat things about what's about to happen,

1167
00:50:48.835 --> 00:50:52.575 line:15% 
the disclosure event, when the announcement is made,

1168
00:50:52.575 --> 00:50:56.035 line:15% 
and the world, we move into the post-disclosure world,

1169
00:50:56.035 --> 00:50:58.815 line:15% 
I like to call it is, is that everybody crosses

1170
00:50:58.815 --> 00:51:01.816 line:15% 
that finish line, or beginning line, together.

1171
00:51:01.816 --> 00:51:03.776 line:15% 
Nobody's first, nobody's last.

1172
00:51:03.776 --> 00:51:07.055 line:15% 
We all go across, at that moment, at the same time.

1173
00:51:07.055 --> 00:51:10.615 line:15% 
I like that, it's a kind of moment of pure equality.

1174
00:51:10.615 --> 00:51:13.935 line:15% 
And then afterwards, we all start working to see

1175
00:51:13.935 --> 00:51:15.856 line:15% 
what we're gonna do and how we're gonna

1176
00:51:15.856 --> 00:51:17.975 line:15% 
be involved, and whatever, fine.

1177
00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:21.035 line:15% 
But in that moment the human race crosses

1178
00:51:21.035 --> 00:51:24.015 line:15% 
into the new world, in a sense, all together,

1179
00:51:24.015 --> 00:51:27.815 line:15% 
hopefully that togetherness will linger for a while.

1180
00:51:27.815 --> 00:51:30.154 line:15% 
But it will be a wonderful moment, and I think it's soon,

1181
00:51:30.154 --> 00:51:32.714 line:15% 
and I look forward to sharing that with you.

1182
00:51:32.714 --> 00:51:34.575 line:15% 
And we'll talk again, I'm sure, after that.

1183
00:51:34.575 --> 00:51:36.174 line:15% 
<v Woman>We certainly will, hopefully not five</v>

1184
00:51:36.174 --> 00:51:37.574 line:15% 
years from now.
<v ->Oh no.</v>

1185
00:51:37.574 --> 00:51:38.934 line:15% 
<v Woman>And thank you so much.</v>
