1
00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:02.891
<v ->I can't begin to tell you what a pleasure it was</v>

2
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.398
to finally meet and have a conversation with former

3
00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:07.861
command sergeant major, Bob Dean.

4
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.136
Bob has spent more than 40 years researching UFO phenomena

5
00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:14.315
from his early days of discovery in the US Army.

6
00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.053
Convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt

7
00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:18.837
as to their presence his work went deeper as

8
00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.117
he began examining

9
00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:22.580
the profound implications of the presence of

10
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.810
other intelligent life forms here on earth.

11
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.848
His perceptions may surprise you.

12
00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:29.428
Meanwhile I ask in advance for your forgiveness for my

13
00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:30.217
chattiness.

14
00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:32.426
I was so over the top with excitement to talk to Bob

15
00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:35.092
that I kept interrupting with more questions.

16
00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:40.013 line:15% 
(mystical music)

17
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.795
After winning a highly publicized lawsuit where you

18
00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:52.179
were denied employment as a result of your research

19
00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.826
into the world of UFOs and winning it,

20
00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.312
you decided that's it, I'm coming out,

21
00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:00.402
and I'm going to now basically trump it

22
00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:02.376
as loud as I can everything I've learned,

23
00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:03.815
and you've learned a lot.

24
00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.184
You've been in the good old boys club and are very

25
00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:07.506
highly respected.
<v ->I learned a lot</v>

26
00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:08.988
while I was in the military.

27
00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:10.973
That's where most of the information I got

28
00:01:10.973 --> 00:01:14.961
came from, and as I said, I was at Shape headquarters

29
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.792
from 1963 to 1967.

30
00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:19.206
<v Woman>Can you tell us what Shape means?</v>

31
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:21.878
<v ->Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe,</v>

32
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.806
and at that time we were located outside of

33
00:01:24.806 --> 00:01:28.095
Paris in a little town called Rocquencourt,

34
00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:31.516
and I was there from 63,

35
00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:34.886
and in 67 Charles de Gaulle threw us out of France.

36
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:38.576
He withdrew from the military alliance.

37
00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:40.198
He stayed a member of NATO of course,

38
00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:42.800
but he withdrew the French military

39
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.999
from the military arm of NATO

40
00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.925
which was Shape, and we had to pack up and

41
00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:53.572
move the headquarters Rocquencourt Paris

42
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:56.729
up to Brussels, and that's the last part of my

43
00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.871
assignment over there.

44
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:59.720
I assisted in that transfer.

45
00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:03.630
We had three box cars filled with classified material

46
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.486
which we had to move from Rocquencourt

47
00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:07.043
up to Brussel,

48
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:10.429
and I came back to the states in 67.

49
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.337
I learned while I was there

50
00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:18.081
I worked in the Supreme Headquarters Operations Center,

51
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:19.962
a place they called shuck,

52
00:02:20.523 --> 00:02:25.124
and when the public report came out in 64,

53
00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.317
I was privy to it in the sense

54
00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.892
that I had a cosmic top secret clearance.

55
00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:32.974
I was able to pull it out of the vault and read it.

56
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:37.166
It shocked me and changed my life.

57
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:39.758
<v Woman>What were you made privy to?</v>

58
00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:46.973
<v ->They conducted a study from 61 to 1964.</v>

59
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.955
I arrived in 63.

60
00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:54.878
I had become aware that this gossip and discussions

61
00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:59.863
among the staff about an ongoing study

62
00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.238
about UFOs, because the UFOs had almost caused

63
00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:09.271
World War three, at least a half a dozen times,

64
00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.106
and they would fly out of the East.

65
00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:15.294
They'd fly over the Warsaw packed area.

66
00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.825
They'd fly over Central Europe.

67
00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:20.520
They would generally fly West and turn

68
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.322
North over the Southern coast of England,

69
00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:28.320
and then they would disappear over the Norwegian Sea.

70
00:03:29.373 --> 00:03:32.865
These objects were metallic, circular,

71
00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:37.924
high altitude, obviously under intelligent control,

72
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.597
in formation.

73
00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.501
For a long time, the Western powers, the NATO people,

74
00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:46.801
the Western alliance thought they belonged

75
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:48.212
to the Soviets.

76
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.640
We were to find later that the Soviets thought they

77
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.904
belonged to us.

78
00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:55.536
After this study was published in 64 it became very clear

79
00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:57.780
that it didn't belong to any of us,

80
00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:00.315
because the repeated evidence,

81
00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:03.642
the examples of incredibly advanced technology

82
00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:08.212
indicated that whoever they were they weren't from here.

83
00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:10.926
We and the Soviets couldn't even begin to

84
00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:14.478
duplicate their capability, and as I said it was very

85
00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:16.958
obviously under intelligent control,

86
00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:20.888
and they demonstrated repeatedly aspects

87
00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:24.973
of technology we couldn't even begin to match.

88
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.108
<v Woman>When you first became aware of this,</v>

89
00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:29.389
were you intrigued more than anything?

90
00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.801
Did it have a frightening element to it?

91
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:32.590
Or was it more an

92
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.710
excitement to you?
<v ->Well, let me say this</v>

93
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.698
I was curious.

94
00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:37.347
I was a professional military.

95
00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:39.068
I wore a crew cut.

96
00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:42.295
I was a Korean veteran.

97
00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:45.292
I led combat troops on the front lines

98
00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:46.907
of Korea in 51.

99
00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:51.303
I was eventually in the, I would end up in Vietnam,

100
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.677
but I was a professional military.

101
00:04:53.677 --> 00:04:56.140
I was kind of hard nosed, no nonsense.

102
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.834
If I didn't read it in a field manual it wasn't real.

103
00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.563
You see, that was the kind of person I was.

104
00:05:03.563 --> 00:05:08.563
In 1964 my life changed because I read this study, read

105
00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:11.435
it again and again and again.

106
00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:12.225
Couldn't put it down.

107
00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:15.189
Every time I was on duty in shock in the operation center,

108
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.371
I'd pull it out of vault and read it.

109
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.456
I couldn't stay away from it.

110
00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:23.311
<v Woman>What was it telling you?</v>

111
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.638
<v ->After the three year study they concluded that</v>

112
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.658
the planet had been under

113
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.626
observation, survey, analysis

114
00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:38.653
continually for centuries by apparently an advanced

115
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.218
technology from somewhere else.

116
00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:43.352
That in itself,

117
00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:45.047
I mean think about it.

118
00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:46.952
What that would mean to you.

119
00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:48.157
<v Woman>If you weren't</v>

120
00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:49.257
prepared for that.
<v ->I'm a no nonsense</v>

121
00:05:49.257 --> 00:05:49.970
kind of person.

122
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.911
I had an open mind and I was curious and I

123
00:05:55.176 --> 00:05:56.220
I had done some research,

124
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.236
listened a little bit, learned a little bit,

125
00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:02.353
but when I opened that study.

126
00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:04.028
It was about an inch thick.

127
00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:08.523
It was supported by about eight inches of annexes.

128
00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:15.439
I analyzed it, studied it, and it literally changed my life.

129
00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:18.416
The implications of it were

130
00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:19.675
earth shaking.

131
00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:20.699
<v Woman>Who produced the study again?</v>

132
00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.249
<v ->It was produced by NATO.</v>

133
00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.134
<v Woman>By NATO</v>
<v ->Yeah,</v>

134
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.531
by a military committee.

135
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:26.363
<v Woman>Okay.</v>

136
00:06:26.363 --> 00:06:28.176
<v ->That was appointed to study this.</v>

137
00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:28.912
<v Woman>Okay.</v>

138
00:06:28.912 --> 00:06:32.555
<v ->An incident occurred in 1961 before I got there.</v>

139
00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:35.120
on February 2, 1961

140
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.012
a massive flotilla of these objects flew over

141
00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:42.757
the Warsaw packed area over the Western Alliance,

142
00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:45.075
divided Europe.

143
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.911
In formation, very high and very fast,

144
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.738
and as I say, they circled the Southern coast of England,

145
00:06:51.738 --> 00:06:54.383
went North and disappeared over the Norwegian Sea.

146
00:06:54.383 --> 00:06:56.681
That almost triggered World War three.

147
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.401
An air marshall with the name of Sir Thomas Pike

148
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.908
insisted on having a study to figure

149
00:07:03.908 --> 00:07:06.919
out what the hell is going on.

150
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.538
I worked for a general by the name of Lyman Lemniser

151
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:15.463
a four star American general who was SACURE,

152
00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:18.087
The Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

153
00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:21.603
Air marshall pike was deputy Sarcure.

154
00:07:21.603 --> 00:07:24.898
He was a British air marshall, five star rank

155
00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:29.005
who was a deputy to Limister.

156
00:07:29.005 --> 00:07:32.140
He in 61 he determined that we got to find

157
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.484
out what's going on here.

158
00:07:33.484 --> 00:07:38.273
He created a military committee to make this analysis

159
00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:39.266
his study.

160
00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:43.008
They published it in 64 in June 64.

161
00:07:43.008 --> 00:07:45.552
They called it an assessment.

162
00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:49.995
Subtitle, an evaluation of a possible military threat

163
00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:51.589
to allied powers in Europe.

164
00:07:52.108 --> 00:07:54.336
Strictly military, no nonsense.

165
00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:56.246
What the hell is going on?

166
00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:56.938
What's happening?

167
00:07:56.938 --> 00:08:01.938
And it was a detailed analysis by experts

168
00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:04.868
from all over Western Europe.

169
00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:08.852
They had an annex on history.

170
00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:10.265
They had an annex on

171
00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:12.041
the scientific aspects,

172
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:16.216
atmospheric physics, all of it.

173
00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:18.356
There was an annex on the the theological

174
00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:21.886
implications, and that one really grabbed me.

175
00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:22.718
<v Woman>What did that</v>
<v ->Because I've</v>

176
00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:23.945
been a student of history.

177
00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:24.691
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

178
00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:28.318
<v ->And they determined that the theological implications</v>

179
00:08:28.318 --> 00:08:32.147
of this reality would literally be earth shaking.

180
00:08:32.147 --> 00:08:36.343
The study was classified cosmic top secret.

181
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.182
It was and still is I'm told in the files

182
00:08:41.182 --> 00:08:43.059
and is still classified,

183
00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:47.976
because they concluded and determined that

184
00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:50.134
this was literally dynamite.

185
00:08:51.304 --> 00:08:53.986
As I say, the implications are earth shaking.

186
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.061
That was my beginning.

187
00:08:56.061 --> 00:08:57.821
That's got me started, and I haven't

188
00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:01.286
been able to walk away from this ever since.

189
00:09:01.286 --> 00:09:02.194
<v Woman>You've been obsessed.</v>

190
00:09:02.194 --> 00:09:03.954
<v ->I've been obsessed, oh, that's</v>

191
00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:05.505
the word I use, yes.

192
00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:07.696
<v ->It's almost like an addiction.</v>

193
00:09:07.696 --> 00:09:09.296
<v Woman>And justifiably so.</v>

194
00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:14.296
<v ->If you learn enough as I did, you wanna know more,</v>

195
00:09:15.537 --> 00:09:17.820
and the more you learn the more you wanna know,

196
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.462
and it just doesn't stop.

197
00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:22.389
It's like I'm addicted to this reality.

198
00:09:23.088 --> 00:09:24.432
I'm obsessed by it.

199
00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:27.899
<v Woman>Because you kept ratcheting up the intrigue</v>

200
00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.490
factor, the more you learned, and some of the things

201
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.647
just even sitting yesterday in one of your talks,

202
00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:35.301
just the bits and pieces from there

203
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:36.880
any one of them we could talk about

204
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.197
for hours, but I don't know if it's appropriate at this

205
00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:42.404
time to jump into the fact, one of things you learned

206
00:09:42.404 --> 00:09:45.145
is that we are dealing on earth with four

207
00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:48.911
different E.T. civilizations who have always been here.

208
00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:53.081
Also that humans are said to be hybrid beings,

209
00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:54.991
hybridized from

210
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:56.611
off planet cultures.
<v ->You see,</v>

211
00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:01.230
when you really lift the lid off of this Pandora's box

212
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.882
you can't close it again.

213
00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Woman>Right.</v>

214
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.893
<v ->And I've been at this now for over 40 years,</v>

215
00:10:06.893 --> 00:10:11.355
and as I said the theological implications are dynamite.

216
00:10:11.383 --> 00:10:15.020
I fully understand why the Brookings report was published

217
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.465
and issued to Congress and to NASA in 1961.

218
00:10:18.465 --> 00:10:20.066
<v Woman>Give us a little brief on the Brookings report.</v>

219
00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:21.569
<v ->Well the Brookings report is available.</v>

220
00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:23.589
You can get a copy of it.

221
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:29.332
A study was done by a bunch of experts back in 60, 61

222
00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:32.256
about the implications of contact with extraterrestrial

223
00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:35.876
intelligence that was a through

224
00:10:35.876 --> 00:10:39.310
analysis, and they determined, these experts,

225
00:10:39.828 --> 00:10:42.914
Margaret Mead was one of them who helped study this thing,

226
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:47.070
and they determined that the implications of contact

227
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.070
with extraterrestrial intelligence would be so disturbing

228
00:10:53.224 --> 00:10:58.224
to the body politics, the sociological balance

229
00:10:59.262 --> 00:11:03.070
of society on this planet that they recommended

230
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:07.282
that when this day occurred, this contact occurred

231
00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:09.948
they didn't seem to grasp at the time that it's

232
00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:12.331
been going on for centuries.

233
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.030
That we cannot release this to the public.

234
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.512
The masses of people out there cannot handle this,

235
00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.998
and cannot deal with it so thereby,

236
00:11:20.998 --> 00:11:23.995
being the experts, self-appointed as we are,

237
00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:26.427
we're not gonna tell anybody about this

238
00:11:26.427 --> 00:11:28.870
and that's when the lid came down,

239
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.358
but you cannot close the lid on Pandora's box.

240
00:11:34.682 --> 00:11:36.799
No, you can't close it, because

241
00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:41.799
they have been continually gently and subtly trying

242
00:11:42.538 --> 00:11:46.936
to educate us as to their presence and to their reality,

243
00:11:47.411 --> 00:11:48.553
and not only that, they

244
00:11:48.553 --> 00:11:53.553
have been trying to sociologically, psychologically

245
00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:59.376
gently help us grow into a level of maturity

246
00:11:59.528 --> 00:12:01.666
which we are not at the moment,

247
00:12:02.174 --> 00:12:04.892
so we can accept their presence

248
00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:07.937
and our place in the universe,

249
00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.530
and that process is underway,

250
00:12:10.791 --> 00:12:14.370
and they've been conducting it for centuries,

251
00:12:14.738 --> 00:12:17.810
but they have been increasing and raising

252
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.952
the level of exposure over the years.

253
00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:25.836
They've been showing up all over the damn place.

254
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.887
<v Woman>We just finished.</v>

255
00:12:26.887 --> 00:12:28.700
You and I were both in Jamie Mazon's

256
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.133
presentation with this year's flying saucer video.

257
00:12:32.133 --> 00:12:36.079
<v ->Fly saucers are a little tiny part of it.</v>

258
00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:36.773
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

259
00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:38.003
<v ->Yeah.</v>

260
00:12:38.105 --> 00:12:40.025
<v Woman>As the most obvious part</v>

261
00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.326
of this
<v ->Well, as I</v>

262
00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:44.164
said, they've been appearing over our cities, all

263
00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:47.854
over the planet, all over the planet, every major country

264
00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:51.567
on the planet has got flyovers,

265
00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:56.567
contact, landings, face to face.

266
00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.021
<v Woman>To say nothing of ancient art.</v>

267
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.880
<v ->Well, then when you get into the ancient aspect of it</v>

268
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.547
as a student of history years ago,

269
00:13:04.547 --> 00:13:07.010
that's one of the things that intrigued me,

270
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.509
and in my slideshow I have evidence that their

271
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:14.524
presence has been known and recognized

272
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:19.170
by a certain select group of people on the planet

273
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.358
for centuries.

274
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:26.496
The Catholic church has been sitting on incredible reality

275
00:13:27.469 --> 00:13:29.974
for a long, long time, but as we know

276
00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:31.970
the Catholic church, and I don't intend

277
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.083
to throw any stones here, but they've been sitting

278
00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:37.847
on a lot of truth for too damn long.

279
00:13:37.847 --> 00:13:38.892
<v Woman>Yes.</v>
<v ->Anyhow,</v>

280
00:13:38.892 --> 00:13:42.005
the problem is that the truth is coming out,

281
00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:44.352
and you can't sit on it any longer

282
00:13:44.352 --> 00:13:46.721
whether you're the pope or whether you're the president

283
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:48.458
of the United States or whether you're

284
00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:50.294
the secretary general of

285
00:13:50.294 --> 00:13:54.453
what do they call that crowd in New York

286
00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:56.089
on the river there?

287
00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:57.024
United Nations.

288
00:13:57.024 --> 00:13:57.834
<v Woman>Oh, United Nations.</v>

289
00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:00.458
<v ->Talk about disunited nations.</v>

290
00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:01.482
<v Woman>Disunited nations.</v>

291
00:14:01.482 --> 00:14:05.386
<v ->Anyhow, we are a species of adolescents,</v>

292
00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.612
and that's our problem.

293
00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.975
We haven't quite grown up,

294
00:14:08.975 --> 00:14:09.982
and we're gonna have to grow up to deal

295
00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:13.030
with this extraterrestrial reality,

296
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.791
and it isn't extraterrestrial anymore.

297
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:19.365
We've learned that they're here on our planet.

298
00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:21.061
They're all over the damn place.

299
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.108
They're all over our solar system.

300
00:14:23.108 --> 00:14:24.133
They're on the moon.

301
00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.146
They're on mars,

302
00:14:25.146 --> 00:14:30.146
and they've got gigantic ships in the rings of Saturn

303
00:14:30.585 --> 00:14:33.875
which I am convinced that they're probably mining them,

304
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.740
but we've got photographs.

305
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.063
NASA.

306
00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.723
<v Woman>You shown some of this in your presentation.</v>

307
00:14:41.723 --> 00:14:43.651
<v ->Oh, well I get angry when I talk about NASA.</v>

308
00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.347
I'm a friend of Richard Hoagland.

309
00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:47.421
I've admired his work for years.

310
00:14:47.822 --> 00:14:49.795
Never a straight answer.

311
00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:52.814
Well, never an honest answer.

312
00:14:52.814 --> 00:14:54.588
Anyhow, NASA knows most of this.

313
00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:57.175
The photographs are overwhelming.

314
00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:59.704
I've shown in my presentation last night

315
00:14:59.704 --> 00:15:04.513
pictures taken by a retired NASA scientist by the name

316
00:15:04.513 --> 00:15:07.085
of Norman Bergman who wrote a powerful

317
00:15:07.085 --> 00:15:09.505
book called the Ring Makers of Saturn.

318
00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:11.970
Norman thinks that they're making the rings.

319
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.798
I think they're mining them.

320
00:15:13.826 --> 00:15:16.022
<v Woman>What is the composition of the materials</v>

321
00:15:16.022 --> 00:15:17.697
they'd be mining from the rings of Saturn?

322
00:15:17.697 --> 00:15:19.947
<v ->Oh well, the rings I think are probably rich</v>

323
00:15:19.947 --> 00:15:23.873
in nutrients as it were, minerals.

324
00:15:23.873 --> 00:15:26.849
I think the rings are primarily made from minerals

325
00:15:26.849 --> 00:15:31.702
from some geological event eons ago perhaps,

326
00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:35.904
but what I'm trying to say is that these intelligences

327
00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:40.874
are all over the place, and they are trying to nurture

328
00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:44.960
us out of our adolescence into some adulthood

329
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.095
by their presence, and one of the things

330
00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:51.392
that is so dynamite in it's implications,

331
00:15:51.392 --> 00:15:52.926
and I touch upon this

332
00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:57.926
is that I've accepted the fact that advanced

333
00:15:58.003 --> 00:16:01.332
extraterrestrial intelligence has initiated and

334
00:16:01.332 --> 00:16:05.730
orchestrated every major religion on this planet,

335
00:16:06.228 --> 00:16:08.989
and if you don't think that is dynamite.

336
00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:10.292
<v Woman>That's dynamite.</v>

337
00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:11.843
<v ->Oh, God.</v>

338
00:16:12.308 --> 00:16:15.048
I have many good friends over the years that are

339
00:16:15.048 --> 00:16:17.090
what I would call fundamentalists.

340
00:16:17.299 --> 00:16:19.432
I was raised a Christian.

341
00:16:19.432 --> 00:16:20.295
I'm not religious.

342
00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:22.145
I don't go to church,

343
00:16:22.802 --> 00:16:25.473
but I consider myself a very spiritual person.

344
00:16:26.012 --> 00:16:28.637
I consider myself somewhat enlightened,

345
00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:31.691
you know, relatively speaking.

346
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.250
I'm not the brightest bulb in the marquee,

347
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.473
but I've spent some time turning over stones

348
00:16:39.473 --> 00:16:41.281
and learning things.

349
00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:47.527
There is a spiritual implication to this that is really

350
00:16:47.527 --> 00:16:49.163
the bottom line.

351
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.579
It isn't the hardware.

352
00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.780
It isn't the economic thing.

353
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.848
It isn't the sociological impact,

354
00:16:56.848 --> 00:16:59.488
nor the psychological impact.

355
00:16:59.632 --> 00:17:04.047
The theological impact is the thing that I think is dynamite

356
00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:07.184
and as I said, how do you tell the mass of people

357
00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:10.063
out there that every religion on the planet was initiated

358
00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:13.007
and orchestrated by an advanced intelligence.

359
00:17:13.007 --> 00:17:14.725
<v Woman>I have a question right here.</v>

360
00:17:14.725 --> 00:17:18.745
Was it orchestrated by or was it simply lure that has

361
00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:21.509
been positioned in a certain way and handed down that has

362
00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:25.475
become based on cosmological events of the past

363
00:17:25.475 --> 00:17:27.075
that seem beyond the ordinary?

364
00:17:27.075 --> 00:17:29.870
<v ->The sad thing about it is the initial</v>

365
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.157
idea of deity, the inital

366
00:17:34.157 --> 00:17:36.871
idea of spiritualism

367
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.791
was injected into our development.

368
00:17:43.822 --> 00:17:47.373
Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism,

369
00:17:47.373 --> 00:17:51.160
Islam, Christianity, all of them have

370
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.775
been initiated with an appropriate idea

371
00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:56.187
and a purpose.

372
00:17:56.727 --> 00:18:01.063
Human beings have taken some of this and changed it.

373
00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:02.935
They eliminated it.

374
00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:07.137
They rewrote it, added chapters of their own.

375
00:18:07.137 --> 00:18:09.548
Human beings, being the selfish little bastards

376
00:18:09.548 --> 00:18:11.265
that we are have

377
00:18:13.115 --> 00:18:16.192
contaminated those original ideas and those

378
00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:19.254
original truths, and so when you go to church

379
00:18:19.254 --> 00:18:22.465
today, no matter what church you might wanna go to,

380
00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:24.666
you're not getting the straight story.

381
00:18:25.163 --> 00:18:27.935
You're getting interpretations and political

382
00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:31.146
rewriting and evaluations.

383
00:18:31.146 --> 00:18:35.115
<v Woman>It seems like it becomes narrower and narrower</v>

384
00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.875
coned.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

385
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.313
<v Woman>Of information.</v>

386
00:18:38.313 --> 00:18:40.777
<v ->For example, I've always been a great admirer</v>

387
00:18:40.777 --> 00:18:45.028
of the Jewish rabbi in Judea 2,000 years ago.

388
00:18:45.173 --> 00:18:47.625
He was a very special man.

389
00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:50.477
He was more special in most christian's grasp,

390
00:18:51.274 --> 00:18:53.400
and he gave them the truth.

391
00:18:53.663 --> 00:18:55.746
Look what they've done with it.

392
00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:58.072
He really did give them the truth.

393
00:18:58.313 --> 00:19:00.350
He told them, first of all, I'm not from here.

394
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.280
This is not my kingdom.

395
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.555
In my father's house there are many mansions

396
00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:08.632
and he inferred to the skies,

397
00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:11.842
space, the infinity of the universe,

398
00:19:12.007 --> 00:19:14.418
and he says I've come into the world to give

399
00:19:14.418 --> 00:19:18.081
you the truth, and he did,

400
00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:20.919
and then they hung him on a cross.

401
00:19:21.277 --> 00:19:22.642
<v Woman>And we've been killing people in</v>

402
00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:23.357
that manner ever since.

403
00:19:23.357 --> 00:19:24.733
<v ->And we've been burning people at the stake</v>

404
00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:26.407
ever since, so to speak.

405
00:19:26.407 --> 00:19:28.721
We stopped literally burning them at the stake

406
00:19:28.721 --> 00:19:29.649
thank God.

407
00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:32.274
If they hadn't I would have been one of the first

408
00:19:32.274 --> 00:19:34.407
to be lined up and burned at the stake,

409
00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:37.458
but you know, I'm still grieving over the death

410
00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:41.516
of an Italian priest by the name of Giordano Bruno.

411
00:19:42.054 --> 00:19:43.004
<v Woman>Why?</v>

412
00:19:43.004 --> 00:19:44.145
<v ->300 years ago,</v>

413
00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:48.060
because he had the gall and audacity to come out

414
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.405
and say, hey we're not alone.

415
00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:52.613
The universe is filled with life.

416
00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:54.352
We're all God's children,

417
00:19:54.352 --> 00:19:56.907
and they burned him at the stake.

418
00:19:56.913 --> 00:20:01.913
They've only apologized to Galileo in the last 60 years.

419
00:20:02.246 --> 00:20:03.386
Think of that for a moment.

420
00:20:03.386 --> 00:20:04.059
<v Woman>That's true.</v>

421
00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:07.567
Speaking of bringing that whole notion of buring

422
00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:09.541
people at the stake into contemporary times,

423
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.375
another person that

424
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:14.841
has been burned at the stake by many

425
00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:17.656
is Philip Corso.

426
00:20:17.656 --> 00:20:18.533
<v ->Oh, poor Phil.</v>

427
00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:20.975
<v Woman>You said the Brookings report came out in 1961.</v>

428
00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:23.460
Isn't that about the time that Philip Corso

429
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.594
became involved with the exotic technologies

430
00:20:25.594 --> 00:20:27.503
that were the debris from what was going on?

431
00:20:27.503 --> 00:20:28.804
<v ->I think it's somewhere in that time, yeah.</v>

432
00:20:28.804 --> 00:20:29.935
<v Woman>Right around 61 as I recall, but</v>

433
00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:31.748
you knew him.
<v ->I admired Phil.</v>

434
00:20:31.748 --> 00:20:34.136
I knew him and I learned to love the man.

435
00:20:34.136 --> 00:20:35.597
He was a dear person.

436
00:20:35.597 --> 00:20:38.317
He told the truth, and his book was filled with it.

437
00:20:38.317 --> 00:20:42.521
<v Woman>And this whole thing was 14 years after</v>

438
00:20:42.521 --> 00:20:43.821
the crash in Roswell.

439
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:46.882
Apparently the debris had been whisked away

440
00:20:46.882 --> 00:20:49.484
by various parts of the military, branches of the military.

441
00:20:49.484 --> 00:20:52.163
Each one had their own, and he was

442
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:55.682
apparently handed over

443
00:20:55.682 --> 00:20:57.752
as head of, what was it called?

444
00:20:57.752 --> 00:20:58.627
Foreign Technologies.

445
00:20:58.627 --> 00:21:00.600
<v ->The Foreign Technology division, yeah.</v>

446
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.826
<v Woman>Division of the Pentagon.</v>

447
00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:02.711
<v ->Well he was</v>

448
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:03.682
apart of it.
<v Woman>A file cabinet</v>

449
00:21:03.682 --> 00:21:07.426
with debris, and he says that that debris

450
00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:10.136
is what was much of our technology that

451
00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.141
evolved from that.
<v ->Let me tell out about some</v>

452
00:21:12.141 --> 00:21:13.110
of that debris.

453
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:18.110
The army scientist had had access and and had possession

454
00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:20.491
of it for years, couldn't do any damn thing with it.

455
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:22.560
They had stuff they didn't need.

456
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.532
<v Woman>I wonder why it was 14 year,</v>

457
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:24.791
why 14 years it elapsed.
<v ->Well, they were</v>

458
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:25.718
working on it.

459
00:21:25.718 --> 00:21:26.764
They were looking at it.

460
00:21:26.764 --> 00:21:28.299
They were trying to analyze it,

461
00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:30.411
and reverse engineer it,

462
00:21:30.411 --> 00:21:33.036
and they didn't even know where to begin,

463
00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:34.752
because they were dealing with technology,

464
00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:38.255
they had metal that they couldn't analyze.

465
00:21:38.474 --> 00:21:40.960
They had plastic kind of.

466
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.602
<v Woman>Kevlar supposedly is</v>

467
00:21:42.602 --> 00:21:44.575
<v ->They had things they, good God they didn't.</v>

468
00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:48.064
Well I'm not knocking the army scientists,

469
00:21:48.064 --> 00:21:51.029
but they didn't have the capability, and for years

470
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:54.676
they played with this stuff, and finally Phil's boss,

471
00:21:54.676 --> 00:21:57.098
I can't, Trudo, General Trudo

472
00:21:57.098 --> 00:22:00.947
gave a passel of it to Phil,

473
00:22:00.947 --> 00:22:03.497
and he said, look I think the answer for us

474
00:22:03.497 --> 00:22:06.542
may be in giving this material

475
00:22:06.633 --> 00:22:08.126
what we've got here.

476
00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:09.961
Phil said that there was a filing cabinet

477
00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.113
full of stuff.

478
00:22:11.113 --> 00:22:14.644
He says let's give it to American industry,

479
00:22:14.644 --> 00:22:16.946
and we had some pretty bright people

480
00:22:16.946 --> 00:22:18.818
then and now,

481
00:22:19.475 --> 00:22:22.471
and Trudo says let's give it to American industry

482
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.957
and say, make what you can of this.

483
00:22:24.957 --> 00:22:26.749
See if you can figure out what this is,

484
00:22:26.749 --> 00:22:29.735
what it's for, and how we can use it,

485
00:22:29.735 --> 00:22:31.315
and that's what Phil did,

486
00:22:31.315 --> 00:22:33.992
and he went trundling off to places

487
00:22:33.992 --> 00:22:36.424
the bell labs, and here and there,

488
00:22:36.424 --> 00:22:37.351
and everywhere.
<v Woman>Right.</v>

489
00:22:37.351 --> 00:22:39.954
<v ->Giving little bits and pieces of stuff to these guys.</v>

490
00:22:39.954 --> 00:22:41.159
<v Woman>Highly compartmentalized.</v>

491
00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:43.164
Each one didn't know what the other had or was doing.

492
00:22:43.164 --> 00:22:44.902
<v ->That's one of the things about our American</v>

493
00:22:44.902 --> 00:22:46.875
security system is it's so damned

494
00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:51.036
compartmentalized that Joe blow over here

495
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:55.601
is got his arms full of stuff and is working on a program,

496
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:58.790
and Joe Smith over here got the same load of stuff

497
00:22:58.790 --> 00:22:59.878
he's working.

498
00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:03.174
Joe and Joe have never talked to each other.

499
00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:04.539
They don't share.

500
00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:07.654
That's one of the problems of our scientific thing,

501
00:23:07.654 --> 00:23:09.744
particularly the military aspect of it.

502
00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:10.831
<v Woman>They're steeped in paranoia.</v>

503
00:23:10.831 --> 00:23:13.039
<v ->It's so compartmentalized that they don't share with</v>

504
00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:13.807
each other.

505
00:23:13.807 --> 00:23:15.482
It's classified.

506
00:23:15.482 --> 00:23:17.295
I'm sorry I can't share that with you

507
00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.428
you're not cleared for that,

508
00:23:19.428 --> 00:23:21.775
that's above your security level,

509
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:26.042
and that sort of thinking just infuriates me

510
00:23:26.042 --> 00:23:28.878
because I'm a retired command Sergeant major,

511
00:23:28.878 --> 00:23:33.454
and it was the nature of my job when I left the service

512
00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:38.169
to turn over stones, rock boats, rattle cages.

513
00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:39.417
<v Woman>Break your security.</v>

514
00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:44.014
<v ->Well my general that I worked for expected that of me,</v>

515
00:23:44.014 --> 00:23:47.496
and he's gone to his rewards.

516
00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:50.914
I wish I could say I've done my best boss, you know.

517
00:23:50.914 --> 00:23:52.280
I've tried.

518
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.699
<v Woman>What happened then?</v>

519
00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:55.832
In your case you were shouting out loud.

520
00:23:55.832 --> 00:23:58.081
In their case, they were sequestering everything,

521
00:23:58.081 --> 00:24:00.727
and they were putting the private sector on it.

522
00:24:00.727 --> 00:24:01.964
I have a question here.

523
00:24:04.644 --> 00:24:08.886
Philip says that Lieutenant Corso says that

524
00:24:08.886 --> 00:24:13.184
in his book, The Day After Roswell that we had transistor

525
00:24:13.184 --> 00:24:16.694
technology, kevlar, laser, many technologies

526
00:24:16.694 --> 00:24:19.403
came out of back engineering some of the debris

527
00:24:19.403 --> 00:24:21.078
from Roswell.

528
00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:21.845
Now,

529
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:24.486
<v ->Let me tell you something to you.</v>

530
00:24:26.196 --> 00:24:28.661
You only recently you say, begun to really look into

531
00:24:28.661 --> 00:24:29.823
this thing.

532
00:24:29.823 --> 00:24:30.495
<v Woman>Yeah, I'm only</v>

533
00:24:30.495 --> 00:24:32.532
last seven or eight years
<v ->Rowell is is a big hoop dee</v>

534
00:24:32.532 --> 00:24:33.578
doo.

535
00:24:33.578 --> 00:24:36.554
One incident at one time and at one place.

536
00:24:36.554 --> 00:24:40.809
There have been dozens of crashes

537
00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:44.543
all over the United States and all over the world

538
00:24:44.543 --> 00:24:45.800
for years.

539
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.608
The Navy retrieved an object off the coast of San Diego

540
00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:51.789
in 1941.

541
00:24:52.189 --> 00:24:54.067
<v Woman>We don't know that this debris necessarily</v>

542
00:24:54.067 --> 00:24:57.362
came from Roswell, then it came from somewhere.

543
00:24:57.362 --> 00:24:58.386
<v ->It came from a variety</v>

544
00:24:58.386 --> 00:24:59.379
of sources.
<v Woman>A variety of places,</v>

545
00:24:59.379 --> 00:25:04.183
so throughout this debris, the accumulated debris,

546
00:25:04.231 --> 00:25:07.347
he says was the spawning of all of those

547
00:25:07.347 --> 00:25:08.967
different technologies.

548
00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:11.388
One question I have, you said, okay they parted it out

549
00:25:11.388 --> 00:25:14.918
to the private sector where they had some

550
00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:16.124
pretty brilliant people.

551
00:25:16.124 --> 00:25:16.775
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

552
00:25:16.775 --> 00:25:18.374
<v Woman>Did those people do you think</v>

553
00:25:18.374 --> 00:25:20.859
because what you've also said

554
00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:23.879
is that there are alien bases here on this planet.

555
00:25:23.879 --> 00:25:25.041
<v ->They're all over the place.</v>

556
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:28.059
<v Woman>Military is working directly with other species.</v>

557
00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.958
<v ->Yes, I can tell you places where that's going on.</v>

558
00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:33.797
<v Woman>And I would like you to share that in a moment,</v>

559
00:25:33.797 --> 00:25:35.932
but I wanted to ask do you think that there was

560
00:25:35.932 --> 00:25:38.597
a collaboration on engineering those technologies

561
00:25:38.597 --> 00:25:39.921
between the others

562
00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:42.288
<v ->Yes.</v>

563
00:25:42.288 --> 00:25:43.056
<v Woman>and the private sector?</v>

564
00:25:43.056 --> 00:25:43.728
<v ->Yes.</v>

565
00:25:43.728 --> 00:25:44.805
<v Woman>Because it happens so quickly.</v>

566
00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:46.303
<v ->Yes,</v>

567
00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:49.723
and that's been going on, and that in itself is a bit

568
00:25:49.723 --> 00:25:51.018
of dynamite.

569
00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:54.548
Yes, we are working with at least one group,

570
00:25:54.736 --> 00:25:58.127
and have been for years, and the dynamite

571
00:25:58.127 --> 00:26:02.863
aspect of it, the one that no one wants to even talk about

572
00:26:02.863 --> 00:26:05.167
is that one of the groups that we have this

573
00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:09.711
relationship with is the very group that had a hand

574
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:14.637
in genetically engineering us 100,000 years ago,

575
00:26:14.637 --> 00:26:16.840
and if you don't think that is social dynamite

576
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.748
<v Woman>Yes</v>

577
00:26:17.748 --> 00:26:18.654
(chuckling)

578
00:26:18.654 --> 00:26:19.209
<v ->I'm serious.</v>

579
00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:19.998
<v Woman>Yes, I know you are.</v>

580
00:26:19.998 --> 00:26:20.968
<v ->We're working with
<v Woman>Absolutely</v>

581
00:26:20.968 --> 00:26:24.041
<v ->an intelligence, a particular group</v>

582
00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:25.801
from a particular planet,

583
00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:28.894
which evidently is in our solar system.

584
00:26:28.894 --> 00:26:32.071
Everybody jokingly refers to it as the 10th planet.

585
00:26:32.071 --> 00:26:35.804
It's been around from the beginning of history so to speak.

586
00:26:35.804 --> 00:26:38.385
We've been working with that particular group.

587
00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:40.193
They've been working with us,

588
00:26:40.423 --> 00:26:43.260
and Eisenhower met them.

589
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:48.260
They landed in a big way and confronted Ike in 54.

590
00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:51.921
Bless his heart, he ended up having a major coronary,

591
00:26:51.921 --> 00:26:53.311
because the shock
<v Woman>I would guess.</v>

592
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:56.197
<v ->of what happened, and what he learned was almost more than</v>

593
00:26:56.197 --> 00:26:57.819
he could bear.

594
00:26:57.819 --> 00:27:00.421
We've been involved with that particular group

595
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:02.470
for years now.

596
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.739
<v Woman>Do you have a name for that group?</v>

597
00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:06.902
Is it even fair to name?

598
00:27:06.971 --> 00:27:10.641
<v ->Well the name that I use generically is</v>

599
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:12.149
Anunnaki.

600
00:27:12.155 --> 00:27:13.457
<v Woman>Which is a broad classification.</v>

601
00:27:13.457 --> 00:27:14.940
<v ->Well, it's a broad, it's a generic term.</v>

602
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.008
It's a broad term, because in the old Sumerian

603
00:27:17.008 --> 00:27:20.064
it means those who came down from above.

604
00:27:20.795 --> 00:27:24.762
There have been a dozen groups, have come down from above.

605
00:27:24.762 --> 00:27:27.471
We're working we know of four that we gotta relationship

606
00:27:27.471 --> 00:27:28.981
with.

607
00:27:28.987 --> 00:27:32.047
One we are intimately involved with.

608
00:27:32.047 --> 00:27:35.120
The intimacy comes from the fact that they

609
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.882
were responsible for genetically engineering us

610
00:27:37.882 --> 00:27:41.081
100,000 years ago, whenever.

611
00:27:41.081 --> 00:27:44.239
That genetic engineering has never ceased.

612
00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:45.444
It's still going on.

613
00:27:45.444 --> 00:27:46.959
<v Woman>We're seeing some upgrades</v>

614
00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:48.698
in the new ones being born.
<v ->Now,</v>

615
00:27:48.698 --> 00:27:52.302
after 54 they begin to provide us not only

616
00:27:52.302 --> 00:27:55.875
bits and pieces of little metal and plastic and you know,

617
00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:57.703
to play with.

618
00:27:57.892 --> 00:27:59.076
<v Woman>Our tinker toys.</v>

619
00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:00.610
<v ->Yeah, tinker toys,</v>

620
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.376
but they gave us some clues to literally

621
00:28:04.376 --> 00:28:08.061
unraveling the biggest secret of all

622
00:28:08.088 --> 00:28:10.097
and that is the human genome.

623
00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:11.032
<v Woman>DNA.</v>

624
00:28:11.032 --> 00:28:15.234
<v ->The double helix and that</v>

625
00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:19.137
is the revolution that is going on now

626
00:28:19.137 --> 00:28:23.084
that very few people can even begin to grasp.

627
00:28:23.084 --> 00:28:25.334
<v Woman>We're going through a major shift in our DNA.</v>

628
00:28:25.334 --> 00:28:29.057
<v ->You're going into a major shift genetically of the species</v>

629
00:28:29.057 --> 00:28:30.562
on this planet.

630
00:28:30.562 --> 00:28:33.623
We literally now have the knowledge to pluck

631
00:28:33.623 --> 00:28:37.707
and take from this tree of life,

632
00:28:37.707 --> 00:28:42.080
the apples that were supposedly denied to poor old Adam

633
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.534
back whenever the hell that was.

634
00:28:44.534 --> 00:28:48.203
We literally and laboratories all over this country,

635
00:28:48.203 --> 00:28:49.760
probably all over the planet

636
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.575
are plucking those apples

637
00:28:52.575 --> 00:28:54.453
from the tree of life,

638
00:28:54.453 --> 00:28:57.678
and those are the genes that make us up.

639
00:28:57.962 --> 00:29:02.962
Now that tree of life opens the door to us

640
00:29:03.882 --> 00:29:08.126
almost to immortality.

641
00:29:08.126 --> 00:29:13.126
That science involved in genetics literally

642
00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:16.419
eventually if we don't mess things up

643
00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:21.784
it could give us unlimited health, no disease,

644
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:26.285
and very likely a form of immortality.

645
00:29:26.642 --> 00:29:30.611
Whether we would life forever or not, I don't know

646
00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:32.562
whether we would want to live forever.

647
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:34.515
I wouldn't, not in this form,

648
00:29:34.515 --> 00:29:39.515
but the point is that we could manipulate our genes

649
00:29:40.157 --> 00:29:42.449
to the point that we could live as long as

650
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:44.214
we might want to live.

651
00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:45.980
<v Woman>And there is some elements that are being</v>

652
00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.138
brought forth that were known about in ancient

653
00:29:49.138 --> 00:29:51.302
times such as the monoatomic gold,

654
00:29:51.302 --> 00:29:52.689
which we can go into in a moment, but

655
00:29:52.689 --> 00:29:55.846
this kind of technology, okay

656
00:29:55.846 --> 00:29:57.264
this would be my question.

657
00:29:57.264 --> 00:29:59.591
Many say that we were an engineered species,

658
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:01.585
engineered to have a short life span.

659
00:30:01.585 --> 00:30:05.157
<v ->Well, that's what they put in the book of Genesis,</v>

660
00:30:05.157 --> 00:30:05.969
wasn't it?

661
00:30:05.969 --> 00:30:08.037
<v Woman>Supposedly in ancient times we lived much longer</v>

662
00:30:08.037 --> 00:30:11.057
than we do now, so what's the story there?

663
00:30:11.057 --> 00:30:14.010
<v ->Well, apparently we were specifically engineered</v>

664
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.627
for a very limited time, because we were a nuisance.

665
00:30:17.627 --> 00:30:19.396
When they created us, and they really did

666
00:30:19.396 --> 00:30:22.853
create us from a selfish point of view,

667
00:30:22.853 --> 00:30:25.081
and the history brings it all out.

668
00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:26.565
<v Woman>Are you talking about Sichen's work?</v>

669
00:30:26.565 --> 00:30:28.912
<v ->I'm not mentioning just Zachariah.</v>

670
00:30:28.912 --> 00:30:29.679
I know him.

671
00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:30.650
I respect him.

672
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.559
There was a British scholar by the name

673
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:36.345
of Christian O'Brian who wrote several books

674
00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:38.574
who had done some of the same work.

675
00:30:38.574 --> 00:30:40.526
<v Woman>And what was his hypothesis in terms of what</v>

676
00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:41.935
we were designed for.
<v ->His point was he was also</v>

677
00:30:41.935 --> 00:30:45.677
able to translate cuneiform, like you and I read the

678
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:48.365
morning paper, and Christian O'Brian has written

679
00:30:48.365 --> 00:30:50.531
a couple of dynamite books that I recommend people

680
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:53.945
to try to obtain and read, and reached the basically

681
00:30:53.945 --> 00:30:55.565
the same conclusion.

682
00:30:55.565 --> 00:30:58.403
We were engineered for a specific period of time

683
00:30:58.403 --> 00:31:00.973
as a slave race.

684
00:31:00.973 --> 00:31:04.163
They were greedy, and they did us originally for their

685
00:31:04.163 --> 00:31:07.873
own agenda, and they used us

686
00:31:07.873 --> 00:31:12.034
and then when we begin to manipulate

687
00:31:12.034 --> 00:31:14.023
or multiply.

688
00:31:16.178 --> 00:31:18.434
<v Woman>Certainly they understood that was a potential.</v>

689
00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:20.940
<v ->Well, they didn't think about it apparently.</v>

690
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.819
Their genetic scientist spent must not have looked

691
00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:24.652
ahead far enough.

692
00:31:24.652 --> 00:31:27.019
Anyhow, when they created us and then they gave us the

693
00:31:27.019 --> 00:31:30.827
ability to reproduce, and we multiplied and got out of

694
00:31:30.827 --> 00:31:32.123
control.

695
00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:34.571
We ended up more than they expected, you see,

696
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:39.571
and they used us as a slave race for a long, long time,

697
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:44.383
and finally we multiplied to such an extent that we

698
00:31:44.383 --> 00:31:45.995
became a nuisance.

699
00:31:45.995 --> 00:31:50.995
They ended up overtly leaving the planet.

700
00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:55.806
As I say, Zachariah and I are agreement

701
00:31:55.806 --> 00:31:57.481
that they didn't really ever leave.

702
00:31:57.481 --> 00:32:00.297
They've been here all along,

703
00:32:00.297 --> 00:32:02.547
but they overtly withdraw from

704
00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:06.004
control of the species and let us sort of run

705
00:32:06.004 --> 00:32:09.929
our own race to see where we would go,

706
00:32:09.929 --> 00:32:13.453
and now I think that they're interested enough to

707
00:32:15.077 --> 00:32:16.912
come back and involve themselves with us

708
00:32:16.912 --> 00:32:19.002
to a degree that they're not only gonna be able

709
00:32:19.002 --> 00:32:21.093
to provide us with some guidance and a little

710
00:32:21.093 --> 00:32:23.642
scientific know how

711
00:32:23.642 --> 00:32:24.943
<v Woman>Why the change of heart?</v>

712
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:29.395
<v ->I think that they are an evolving species also.</v>

713
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.348
Every intelligent species in the universe

714
00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:35.972
is in the process of growth and development

715
00:32:35.972 --> 00:32:39.038
and evolution, and

716
00:32:40.366 --> 00:32:42.659
then we're getting into an area of first of all,

717
00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:46.147
why the hell are we here, and that is again,

718
00:32:46.147 --> 00:32:48.462
another subject that we could go on for hours.

719
00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:53.998
What you see in I here, the shell we're living in

720
00:32:53.998 --> 00:32:55.598
is not really us.

721
00:32:55.598 --> 00:32:59.438
We are what we call a soul,

722
00:32:59.438 --> 00:33:02.787
but what we are are a spark of divine conscious

723
00:33:02.787 --> 00:33:04.008
intelligence.

724
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.080
<v Woman>Infinite</v>

725
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.736
<v ->Infinite in our nature.</v>

726
00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:10.146
We incarnate on this planet.

727
00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:11.427
We do it many times.

728
00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:14.840
It's like school, first grade, second grade, so on.

729
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.925
I only suspect that maybe I might be

730
00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:20.919
graduating from grade school right now.

731
00:33:20.919 --> 00:33:23.106
I'm looking forward and hopefully a time

732
00:33:23.106 --> 00:33:24.567
getting out of high school

733
00:33:24.567 --> 00:33:27.468
and maybe getting a degree after a couple of years

734
00:33:27.468 --> 00:33:29.932
at the university, but that's probably way ahead.

735
00:33:29.932 --> 00:33:32.481
<v Woman>But let's say, okay, they've given us tinker toys.</v>

736
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:35.574
We've been able to, with their help maybe, engineer some

737
00:33:35.574 --> 00:33:36.801
things, so we back

738
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:38.124
engineer some things.
<v ->I think they've been</v>

739
00:33:38.124 --> 00:33:39.498
involved in a great way.

740
00:33:39.498 --> 00:33:41.355
I think from the very beginning.

741
00:33:41.355 --> 00:33:43.585
As I said, they overtly withdrew,

742
00:33:43.585 --> 00:33:46.582
but they haven't withdrawn.

743
00:33:46.582 --> 00:33:47.845
They are

744
00:33:48.064 --> 00:33:49.152
<v Woman>Let's talk about where they are.</v>

745
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:52.171
<v ->They have covert involvement with us from</v>

746
00:33:52.171 --> 00:33:53.269
the very beginning.

747
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:54.379
<v Woman>Let's talk about some</v>

748
00:33:54.379 --> 00:33:55.776
<v ->You ought to talk about why they have changed</v>

749
00:33:55.776 --> 00:33:56.468
their tune.

750
00:33:56.468 --> 00:33:58.794
They've grown themselves.

751
00:33:58.794 --> 00:33:59.605
<v Woman>That's what you're saying.</v>

752
00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:00.181
They have evolved now.

753
00:34:00.181 --> 00:34:02.901
<v ->They have evolved and what's interesting to me is</v>

754
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:07.124
that they are I'm sure, and evidence I've collected

755
00:34:07.124 --> 00:34:08.959
and contacts we've made,

756
00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:10.974
and the evidence that they've shared with us

757
00:34:10.974 --> 00:34:12.095
that they have us.

758
00:34:12.095 --> 00:34:15.295
They have a concept of deity very much like our own.

759
00:34:15.295 --> 00:34:19.668
They recognize that there is a conscious intelligence

760
00:34:19.668 --> 00:34:22.099
that permeates the universe

761
00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:27.099
that is benevolent and loving and controlling.

762
00:34:27.742 --> 00:34:30.242
You and I would call it God.

763
00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:36.680
They recognize that there is that power.

764
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.429
<v Woman>They recognize then cause and effect,</v>

765
00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:39.538
karma, what not.

766
00:34:39.538 --> 00:34:41.266
Is this perhaps making up for
<v ->Karma is cosmic law.</v>

767
00:34:41.266 --> 00:34:44.657
<v Woman>what they had perpetuated on this planet</v>

768
00:34:44.657 --> 00:34:45.841
in times past, or are you saying that

769
00:34:45.841 --> 00:34:49.116
<v ->I think they probably regret some of the things</v>

770
00:34:49.116 --> 00:34:50.481
that they may have done initially.

771
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:55.481
As I say, they're not only superior in terms of technology,

772
00:34:56.475 --> 00:34:59.163
but they have a very highly developed spiritual awareness

773
00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.326
as well.

774
00:35:00.326 --> 00:35:04.827
<v Woman>Now at this point, my understanding is that</v>

775
00:35:04.827 --> 00:35:09.827
this is one group of off planet beings, from one culture,

776
00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:11.173
but there are many.

777
00:35:11.173 --> 00:35:11.866
There are several.

778
00:35:11.866 --> 00:35:13.956
<v ->I was aware of four.
<v Woman>They're not on</v>

779
00:35:13.956 --> 00:35:14.906
the same page.

780
00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:16.623
<v ->Are they all on the same page?</v>

781
00:35:16.623 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Woman>No, they're not all on the same page,</v>

782
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.271
and you're talking about, so you're talking about this

783
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:24.282
particular one coming through from that strand of history

784
00:35:24.282 --> 00:35:26.767
of the human species involvement with them

785
00:35:26.767 --> 00:35:28.676
is now coming into a more mature place

786
00:35:28.676 --> 00:35:30.552
not only in their own evolution, but also

787
00:35:30.552 --> 00:35:33.369
encouraging human beings

788
00:35:33.369 --> 00:35:35.012
to come into a more mature place,

789
00:35:35.012 --> 00:35:37.635
and even looking at extending technological help

790
00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.587
for our own advancement, and even perhaps

791
00:35:39.587 --> 00:35:41.934
some of the technologies leading to what we would

792
00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:43.907
call immortality or expanded life spans at least.

793
00:35:43.907 --> 00:35:45.550
<v ->They're helping to nurture us,</v>

794
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.643
and they had some nurturing of their own

795
00:35:48.643 --> 00:35:49.783
over the centuries.

796
00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:51.288
You see,

797
00:35:52.653 --> 00:35:55.512
the Anunnaki, and we use that term generically.

798
00:35:55.512 --> 00:35:59.224
I use it to apply to all the different groups that are

799
00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:02.147
coming and going, but there is a

800
00:36:02.147 --> 00:36:06.876
there is an intelligence out in the universe,

801
00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:10.626
and when I say out, that's misleading,

802
00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:13.148
all around.

803
00:36:14.317 --> 00:36:17.538
As I say, we're in an ocean of conscious intelligence.

804
00:36:17.538 --> 00:36:21.537
There are intelligences out there that we refer to

805
00:36:21.537 --> 00:36:26.316
as transcendentals that are not human.

806
00:36:26.316 --> 00:36:28.678
The Anunnaki are basically like we are.

807
00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:30.389
<v Woman>Let's talk about the trancendentals.</v>

808
00:36:30.389 --> 00:36:32.161
<v ->The trascendentals are</v>

809
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:37.161
a species and a race that is so advanced

810
00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:40.997
you talk about time, we don't grasp time,

811
00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:44.416
but they're so advanced a billion years

812
00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:48.548
they can incarnate in a physical form if they choose.

813
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.133
<v Woman>But they're non-physical in nature.</v>

814
00:36:50.133 --> 00:36:52.127
<v ->But they are non physical beings</v>

815
00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:55.119
in our concept of what physical is.

816
00:36:55.626 --> 00:36:56.628
<v Woman>I have a question.</v>

817
00:36:56.628 --> 00:36:58.324
<v ->They're spiritual primarily,</v>

818
00:36:58.324 --> 00:37:02.313
but they are incredibly advanced intelligent

819
00:37:02.313 --> 00:37:04.430
spiritual beings.

820
00:37:04.798 --> 00:37:06.612
<v Woman>Have they been identified in other people's</v>

821
00:37:06.612 --> 00:37:08.286
work that you know of as something like

822
00:37:08.286 --> 00:37:09.908
the watchers or the guardians?

823
00:37:09.908 --> 00:37:12.468
<v ->That was in those terms the watchers</v>

824
00:37:12.468 --> 00:37:15.113
and the guardians, custodians,

825
00:37:15.113 --> 00:37:17.939
those are all ancient terms.

826
00:37:20.255 --> 00:37:21.417
<v Woman>Would you say these beings you're</v>

827
00:37:21.417 --> 00:37:22.249
talking about
<v ->The trancendentals,</v>

828
00:37:22.249 --> 00:37:24.991
we have traditionally referred to them

829
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:26.526
when we've seen them,

830
00:37:26.526 --> 00:37:30.078
and they have involved themselves in our lives

831
00:37:30.078 --> 00:37:31.694
from time to time.

832
00:37:31.753 --> 00:37:35.736
We referred to them as gods, angels.

833
00:37:35.955 --> 00:37:40.955
They are beings much like us,

834
00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:44.285
but they've reached a point in their evolution

835
00:37:44.285 --> 00:37:46.018
in the time.

836
00:37:46.216 --> 00:37:50.482
I mean, long before there was a planet earth, long

837
00:37:50.482 --> 00:37:54.482
before our little sun was ignited.

838
00:37:54.482 --> 00:37:59.482
By God, these intelligences are really

839
00:37:59.655 --> 00:38:04.156
we stand in awe of them, and they have introduced

840
00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:07.505
themselves into our lives from time to time.

841
00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:09.318
A few years ago, not too long ago,

842
00:38:09.318 --> 00:38:14.318
early 1800s a good endeared man by the name of Joseph Smith

843
00:38:15.302 --> 00:38:18.353
had an experience in his bedroom that shook

844
00:38:18.353 --> 00:38:21.365
that poor guy right to his very foundations,

845
00:38:21.904 --> 00:38:24.731
and when it was over with, after having been visited by

846
00:38:24.731 --> 00:38:27.653
two of these trancendentals, who appeared

847
00:38:27.653 --> 00:38:30.960
as beings of light in his presence he

848
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.373
formed a religion, the Mormon church.

849
00:38:34.373 --> 00:38:35.994
Well that's the kind of

850
00:38:35.994 --> 00:38:40.293
things that happen to people who are confronted

851
00:38:40.293 --> 00:38:45.293
by them as I said, you're never ever the same.

852
00:38:45.818 --> 00:38:48.836
The world does not appear to you anymore

853
00:38:48.836 --> 00:38:50.552
like it did before.

854
00:38:50.552 --> 00:38:52.964
<v Woman>Do you feel that the transcendentals are also</v>

855
00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:55.501
here assisting

856
00:38:55.501 --> 00:38:56.548
now in our
<v ->Oh, they're everywhere.</v>

857
00:38:56.548 --> 00:38:57.913
<v Woman>Our development.</v>

858
00:38:57.913 --> 00:38:59.566
<v ->When I say you talk about here,</v>

859
00:38:59.566 --> 00:39:00.995
what do you mean here?

860
00:39:00.995 --> 00:39:02.830
In San Jose?

861
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:03.598
<v Woman>Well, no.</v>

862
00:39:03.598 --> 00:39:04.365
<v ->Well, the planet?</v>

863
00:39:04.365 --> 00:39:05.155
<v Woman>In earth dimension.</v>

864
00:39:05.155 --> 00:39:06.754
<v ->Oh, they're everywhere.</v>

865
00:39:06.754 --> 00:39:08.685
<v Woman>We're having help from those</v>

866
00:39:08.685 --> 00:39:09.965
<v ->They're timeless beings.</v>

867
00:39:09.965 --> 00:39:11.011
<v Woman>Who are the beings then</v>

868
00:39:11.011 --> 00:39:12.728
that are at the underground bases that you

869
00:39:12.728 --> 00:39:14.541
refer to in Alaska,
<v ->Oh, most of those</v>

870
00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:15.832
<v Woman>Australia and so forth.</v>

871
00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:18.232
<v ->Most of them are Anunnaki.</v>

872
00:39:18.232 --> 00:39:20.663
One or two different species have been seen

873
00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:21.730
in different places.

874
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.287
We're working with several of them.

875
00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:27.244
<v Woman>Can you talk about where the bases are located?</v>

876
00:39:27.244 --> 00:39:29.623
<v ->Let me tell you something,</v>

877
00:39:29.623 --> 00:39:32.977
there is an ET base under Mount Haze in Alaska.

878
00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:37.558
There's another ET base under Zimbabwe.

879
00:39:37.558 --> 00:39:40.278
There's one in the mountains in the Pyrenees

880
00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:43.435
between France and Spain called Mount Perdido.

881
00:39:43.435 --> 00:39:46.774
They generally developed these massive installations

882
00:39:46.774 --> 00:39:51.535
under mountains where they can go and come, you know.

883
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:54.048
They've even been seen flying into mountains.

884
00:39:54.048 --> 00:39:56.218
How they do that, God knows how.

885
00:39:56.693 --> 00:39:57.226
Anyhow,

886
00:39:57.226 --> 00:40:01.034
we've got them in the Puerto Rican Trench.

887
00:40:01.844 --> 00:40:04.411
We've got them at Puerto Rico,

888
00:40:04.411 --> 00:40:05.872
and we're working with them there

889
00:40:05.872 --> 00:40:08.218
in Puerto Rico.

890
00:40:08.218 --> 00:40:12.080
Our military or a certain portion of our military is working

891
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.631
with them.

892
00:40:13.722 --> 00:40:16.399
The most recent information that I've received

893
00:40:16.399 --> 00:40:19.898
that I trust from a source that I consider reliable is

894
00:40:19.898 --> 00:40:22.244
they and we are working together in a

895
00:40:22.244 --> 00:40:26.169
massive way on quadulene atol

896
00:40:27.877 --> 00:40:28.687
<v Woman>Toward what end?</v>

897
00:40:28.687 --> 00:40:29.316
What are we working together

898
00:40:29.316 --> 00:40:32.158
<v ->They're assisting us in science.</v>

899
00:40:32.303 --> 00:40:35.695
They've helped us build our space program,

900
00:40:35.695 --> 00:40:38.014
and I'm not talking about NASA,

901
00:40:38.084 --> 00:40:40.132
and that rattle trap ole shuttle that they throw

902
00:40:40.132 --> 00:40:43.150
up every you know, which bless it's

903
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.145
has killed.

904
00:40:45.145 --> 00:40:47.097
<v Woman>You don't mean NASA, the cover organization.</v>

905
00:40:47.097 --> 00:40:49.229
<v ->NASA, you know, it's a front,</v>

906
00:40:49.229 --> 00:40:51.459
like the old blue book used to be

907
00:40:51.459 --> 00:40:52.696
the Air Force had it.

908
00:40:52.696 --> 00:40:54.392
It was only a public relations front.

909
00:40:54.392 --> 00:40:57.826
We've got a space program full fledged

910
00:40:57.826 --> 00:41:01.677
that is so far beyond NASA.

911
00:41:01.677 --> 00:41:04.903
They're giving us technology.

912
00:41:04.908 --> 00:41:06.647
They're nudging us, encouraging us,

913
00:41:06.647 --> 00:41:07.964
providing us.

914
00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:12.311
Many of the crashes were not crashes.

915
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:15.052
They gave us the hardware

916
00:41:15.052 --> 00:41:17.495
and made it look like a crash,

917
00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:20.342
and the poor little dudes that were inside were not

918
00:41:20.342 --> 00:41:23.297
a species, they were laboratory products.

919
00:41:23.297 --> 00:41:26.006
The little greys that are so

920
00:41:26.006 --> 00:41:27.841
famous and infamous
<v Woman>What are they called</v>

921
00:41:29.661 --> 00:41:31.722
extraterrestrial something,

922
00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.483
EBEs, biological

923
00:41:33.483 --> 00:41:36.246
<v ->Extraterrestrial biological entities</v>

924
00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:37.899
ha ha ha yeah well

925
00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:41.578
the Anunnaki make them like you and I make

926
00:41:41.578 --> 00:41:43.545
whatever.

927
00:41:45.248 --> 00:41:48.149
They're intelligent and they're capable,

928
00:41:48.149 --> 00:41:52.303
and they've been designed to accomplish a great deal,

929
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:57.944
and they use them, and we see them all over the place,

930
00:41:58.154 --> 00:42:01.247
and they grab us and study us.

931
00:42:01.247 --> 00:42:02.751
They evaluate us.

932
00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:04.936
They take samples from us.

933
00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:06.580
Scares the hell out of people.

934
00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.073
Anybody whose been abducted

935
00:42:09.983 --> 00:42:11.763
who can remember it at all,

936
00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:13.336
most people don't remember,

937
00:42:15.251 --> 00:42:16.845
are in a state of shock.

938
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.707
It's not malevolent.

939
00:42:18.707 --> 00:42:20.424
It's not intended to be malevolent.

940
00:42:20.424 --> 00:42:25.346
It's like you grab a wild animal out of the forest.

941
00:42:25.437 --> 00:42:26.877
You give him a shot.

942
00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:29.181
You stun him;

943
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:32.029
You put a collar around his neck,

944
00:42:32.029 --> 00:42:34.194
take blood samples.

945
00:42:34.194 --> 00:42:35.698
We do that to

946
00:42:35.698 --> 00:42:37.468
<v Woman>Other species and you're</v>

947
00:42:37.468 --> 00:42:39.346
saying it's being done to us.
<v ->Other species all the time,</v>

948
00:42:39.346 --> 00:42:41.292
yes, and

949
00:42:41.298 --> 00:42:45.084
we're a basic fundamental

950
00:42:45.084 --> 00:42:48.374
primitive species, and they do it to us,

951
00:42:48.518 --> 00:42:50.886
because biologically they're monitoring our growth and

952
00:42:50.886 --> 00:42:53.393
our development, and in many ways they may

953
00:42:53.393 --> 00:42:57.394
be tinkering with our gene pool.

954
00:42:59.927 --> 00:43:02.162
<v Woman>And obviously this is no concern for alarm</v>

955
00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:04.508
in how,

956
00:43:04.508 --> 00:43:07.361
in your perception, right?

957
00:43:07.762 --> 00:43:10.081
<v ->I have gone beyond alarm.</v>

958
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.756
Forgive me, I am not alarmed and troubled by anything

959
00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:15.041
much anymore.

960
00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:19.366
When I, I may have jokingly told you earlier

961
00:43:19.366 --> 00:43:22.737
that I've just come out of five years of seclusion

962
00:43:22.737 --> 00:43:23.936
so to speak.

963
00:43:24.358 --> 00:43:25.062
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

964
00:43:25.062 --> 00:43:26.619
<v ->I spoke here publicly five years ago,</v>

965
00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:28.731
and I said this is my last public presentation.

966
00:43:28.731 --> 00:43:30.784
I'm not doing this anymore.

967
00:43:30.928 --> 00:43:32.112
I went back to Phoenix, and I

968
00:43:32.112 --> 00:43:35.483
turned myself into a recluse,

969
00:43:35.483 --> 00:43:39.152
and in the process I ended up meditating ,

970
00:43:39.152 --> 00:43:42.213
having a couple of out of body experiences

971
00:43:42.213 --> 00:43:46.228
doing some remote viewing, and

972
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.620
spiritually I've matured somewhat.

973
00:43:50.255 --> 00:43:51.972
<v Woman>Do you care to share what happened in</v>

974
00:43:51.972 --> 00:43:54.223
your remote viewing and out of body experiences

975
00:43:54.223 --> 00:43:56.431
that changed you so radically,

976
00:43:56.431 --> 00:43:58.233
not only helped you recover your health, but

977
00:43:58.233 --> 00:44:00.601
has you here speaking again today?

978
00:44:00.601 --> 00:44:01.582
Why are you here?

979
00:44:01.582 --> 00:44:02.233
What did you see?

980
00:44:04.366 --> 00:44:05.960
<v ->There is no way</v>

981
00:44:06.318 --> 00:44:08.755
there are not words

982
00:44:08.825 --> 00:44:13.731
to describe in human terms what happens

983
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:15.976
to you when you step out

984
00:44:18.147 --> 00:44:22.386
and your conscious intelligence which survives death

985
00:44:22.744 --> 00:44:27.744
looks back and sees not only the planet and the human race

986
00:44:29.037 --> 00:44:33.510
but it sees it all, and you begin to grasp

987
00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:37.186
something about the meaning of it all,

988
00:44:37.186 --> 00:44:38.854
the purpose of it all.

989
00:44:40.737 --> 00:44:43.543
That's when you really begin to discover

990
00:44:43.543 --> 00:44:45.328
that there is a God,

991
00:44:46.262 --> 00:44:50.326
and don't ask me to define for you what God is.

992
00:44:50.326 --> 00:44:53.110
I can tell you that there is a conscious intelligence

993
00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:56.150
that permeates the universe that is literally

994
00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:00.047
outside of time and space,

995
00:45:00.384 --> 00:45:02.324
and when you grasp that,

996
00:45:02.324 --> 00:45:06.089
and you can grasp that in your spiritual sense when you're

997
00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:07.322
out.

998
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:12.127
It's so overwhelming that it's almost

999
00:45:12.127 --> 00:45:14.881
like a religious transformation.

1000
00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:18.957
It's almost like a transfiguration,

1001
00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:21.667
because you're never the same,

1002
00:45:22.377 --> 00:45:26.836
and you cannot put in human terms what you've seen

1003
00:45:26.836 --> 00:45:29.731
what you sensed, and what you learned to feel.

1004
00:45:30.078 --> 00:45:34.398
<v Woman>Why from that perspective of our infinite nature</v>

1005
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.094
that has access to all, knows all,

1006
00:45:36.094 --> 00:45:38.579
is part of all, would we continue to incarnate

1007
00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:39.763
into this game?

1008
00:45:39.763 --> 00:45:41.965
<v ->That's a good question.</v>

1009
00:45:42.525 --> 00:45:45.267
I've jokingly said that they grabbed me

1010
00:45:45.267 --> 00:45:49.906
kicking and screaming and forced me to reincarnate here,

1011
00:45:49.906 --> 00:45:51.692
because I still had a lesson or two to learn.

1012
00:45:52.701 --> 00:45:54.482
A lot of kind friends who've said that they

1013
00:45:54.482 --> 00:45:57.964
forced me to come back so to speak,

1014
00:45:58.642 --> 00:46:01.003
because I had a few things to share.

1015
00:46:01.426 --> 00:46:05.372
I had an idea or two to impart or share to people.

1016
00:46:05.372 --> 00:46:09.233
I'm not presuming that I'm an old philosopher

1017
00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:11.526
who I know all the answers to everything,

1018
00:46:11.526 --> 00:46:14.268
but I will tell you in all honesty that I've learned

1019
00:46:14.268 --> 00:46:16.561
a few answers to a few things.

1020
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:18.054
<v Woman>What's the most important</v>

1021
00:46:18.054 --> 00:46:20.070
<v ->And I've shared them with you here in this interview.</v>

1022
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.189
<v Woman>Okay.</v>

1023
00:46:21.189 --> 00:46:24.384
<v ->Is it we have nothing to fear,</v>

1024
00:46:25.691 --> 00:46:27.797
that you are an immortal being,

1025
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:32.400
that the essential you, the self that you really are

1026
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.210
is immortal and will live forever,

1027
00:46:35.696 --> 00:46:38.437
and that you are a spark of divinity,

1028
00:46:38.437 --> 00:46:40.943
because you're apart of that universal

1029
00:46:40.943 --> 00:46:44.890
intelligent consciousness which a lot of fundamentalists

1030
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.257
call God, and

1031
00:46:47.257 --> 00:46:50.884
if I could leave you with this remark

1032
00:46:50.884 --> 00:46:53.764
this little tiny piece of work,

1033
00:46:53.764 --> 00:46:55.731
nothing to fear.

1034
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.144
Stop being afraid.

1035
00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.955
Look into yourself and learn who you are

1036
00:47:01.955 --> 00:47:03.352
and what you are,

1037
00:47:03.352 --> 00:47:06.781
and grow and live,

1038
00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:11.660
and when this particular sojourn is complete

1039
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.426
I'll see you on the other side, and we will play

1040
00:47:15.426 --> 00:47:18.285
in the fields of the Lord so to speak.

1041
00:47:18.285 --> 00:47:19.885
<v Woman>And may come back and do this all again.</v>

1042
00:47:19.885 --> 00:47:22.157
<v ->Well, I'm not
<v Woman>Are you saying no?</v>

1043
00:47:22.157 --> 00:47:24.502
You said you'd never be back five years ago

1044
00:47:24.502 --> 00:47:25.868
to this conference.

1045
00:47:25.868 --> 00:47:27.383
Are you saying you'll never be back?

1046
00:47:27.383 --> 00:47:29.100
Will I never see you here again?

1047
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:33.164
<v ->Look, I know when you incarnate you incarnate</v>

1048
00:47:33.164 --> 00:47:36.204
not merely on planet earth as a human being.

1049
00:47:36.204 --> 00:47:40.033
Your spirit can incarnate on any planet in the universe,

1050
00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:42.608
and there are billions of them out there

1051
00:47:42.678 --> 00:47:47.678
that you're free to go and incarnate in any physical level

1052
00:47:47.819 --> 00:47:49.674
you might want to you.

1053
00:47:49.674 --> 00:47:52.021
If you feel that you need a couple of more lessons,

1054
00:47:52.021 --> 00:47:54.917
lessons in humility.

1055
00:47:58.453 --> 00:48:01.919
When you finally learn a couple of things along the way

1056
00:48:01.919 --> 00:48:03.556
you eliminate pride.

1057
00:48:04.127 --> 00:48:06.947
One of our biggest vices.

1058
00:48:07.252 --> 00:48:09.550
You eliminate most of your ego.

1059
00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:15.346
You eliminate vanity, and when you get rid of that garbage

1060
00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:16.959
you're coming along.

1061
00:48:16.959 --> 00:48:19.000
You're making some progress.

1062
00:48:19.006 --> 00:48:21.443
When you learn to love,

1063
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.173
and I'm not talking about sex.

1064
00:48:24.317 --> 00:48:27.987
I'm talking about that human feeling

1065
00:48:27.987 --> 00:48:30.686
where we care about each other

1066
00:48:30.686 --> 00:48:35.371
as much as we care about ourselves, that's love.

1067
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:37.828
<v Woman>And you've learned a lot, because the one</v>

1068
00:48:37.828 --> 00:48:40.466
thing that every single person here including all

1069
00:48:40.466 --> 00:48:43.282
the other presenters will say about you is you're

1070
00:48:43.282 --> 00:48:45.650
one walking heart.

1071
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.231
<v ->I'm sorry.</v>

1072
00:48:48.231 --> 00:48:50.396
<v Woman>They'll say you're a walking heart.</v>

1073
00:48:50.396 --> 00:48:51.900
You've obviously learned

1074
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.532
this part of the lesson.
<v ->I'm an old gnostic.</v>

1075
00:48:53.532 --> 00:48:55.847
I really am a gnostic.

1076
00:48:55.847 --> 00:48:58.055
I mean, that's not a religious sense.

1077
00:48:58.055 --> 00:48:59.942
The Greeks use the word gnostic as

1078
00:48:59.942 --> 00:49:03.377
the knowledge of the heart, and you see,

1079
00:49:03.377 --> 00:49:05.574
I think that's probably the center of where our

1080
00:49:05.574 --> 00:49:09.926
real being is.

1081
00:49:09.926 --> 00:49:13.819
If our spirit and if our spark of divinity resides within

1082
00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:15.744
us anywhere it's in the heart,

1083
00:49:16.858 --> 00:49:19.888
and if I have been able to communicate even

1084
00:49:19.888 --> 00:49:23.141
a tiny bit of that while I've been here,

1085
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:26.394
and what I've been doing over the years.

1086
00:49:26.394 --> 00:49:28.921
The analogy I like using is

1087
00:49:28.921 --> 00:49:33.921
if each of us can light one small candle.

1088
00:49:34.383 --> 00:49:37.651
You, I, everybody,

1089
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:40.814
if we can each light one small candle

1090
00:49:40.814 --> 00:49:43.897
can you imagine what a glorious corrugation

1091
00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:45.060
that would be?

1092
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.009
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

1093
00:49:46.009 --> 00:49:49.049
<v ->The light would illuminate the world.</v>

1094
00:49:49.049 --> 00:49:52.718
I would say to you affectionately and lovingly,

1095
00:49:52.718 --> 00:49:57.571
light a candle, and I wanna thank you for this interview.

1096
00:49:57.571 --> 00:49:58.573
I've enjoyed it.

1097
00:49:58.573 --> 00:49:59.362
<v Woman>Thank you so much.</v>

1098
00:49:59.362 --> 00:50:01.176
I've so much been looking forward to meeting

1099
00:50:01.176 --> 00:50:02.519
you though the last few years,

1100
00:50:02.519 --> 00:50:05.325
and I feel it's completely our honor

1101
00:50:05.325 --> 00:50:06.328
to have done so.

1102
00:50:06.328 --> 00:50:06.936
<v ->You know it's</v>

1103
00:50:06.936 --> 00:50:07.810
my pleasure.
<v Woman>Thank you for</v>

1104
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:08.696
sharing your heart.

1105
00:50:08.696 --> 00:50:10.455
<v ->I thank you, and what I have been saying</v>

1106
00:50:10.455 --> 00:50:11.693
comes from my heart.

1107
00:50:11.693 --> 00:50:12.407
<v Woman>Yes, absolutely</v>

1108
00:50:12.407 --> 00:50:13.431
I can feel it.
<v ->Not from here,</v>

1109
00:50:13.431 --> 00:50:14.914
this is not particularly good.

1110
00:50:14.914 --> 00:50:18.636
This is an unfinished

1111
00:50:18.636 --> 00:50:22.252
incomplete tool up here,

1112
00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:25.857
and I use it to get by, because I'm here

1113
00:50:25.857 --> 00:50:29.612
in a material form, but what I've been speaking to you,

1114
00:50:29.612 --> 00:50:32.630
the spark within me is in the heart.

1115
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.771
<v Woman>I can feel that, that's where you're</v>

1116
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:34.720
radiating.

1117
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.046
Bob, thank you so much for taking the time.

1118
00:50:37.046 --> 00:50:39.130
<v ->It's been my pleasure.</v>

1119
00:50:40.598 --> 00:50:42.752
<v ->I hope you've enjoyed this interview as much as I</v>

1120
00:50:42.752 --> 00:50:44.234
enjoyed conducting it.

1121
