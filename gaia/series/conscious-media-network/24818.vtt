00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:02.314
<v ->About a year and a half has passed</v>

2
00:00:02.314 --> 00:00:05.033
since our last interview with Dr. Harvey Bigelsen,

3
00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.996
and much has occurred in that time.

4
00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.118
Since then, Harvey has made some discoveries

5
00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:11.679
concerning the deadly Hepatits C.

6
00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.675
His observations and clinical work is suggesting

7
00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:18.578
that Hepatitis C is not necessarily contracted via IV's,

8
00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:20.498
and other external contact,

9
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.155
instead, he is saying that the human body

10
00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.737
actually creates Hepatitis C

11
00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:29.469
as a result of traumatic inflammation, such as surgery.

12
00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.136
Harvey also gives us a history of how the medical industry

13
00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.361
we have today was originally conceived.

14
00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:41.121 line:15% 
(gentle music)

15
00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:45.221
Okay, Harvey, so we're picking it up

16
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:46.723
from a couple of years ago,

17
00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:49.988
and you have made some incredible findings since then.

18
00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:53.580
Let's start this entire interview out with talking about

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.046
homotoxicology because it seems like that's the beginning

20
00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.106
of the path of everything else

21
00:00:58.106 --> 00:00:59.706
you're going to be telling us.

22
00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:03.183
<v ->Homotoxicology came up in the '30's and '40's</v>

23
00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:05.272
in Europe by a Professor Hans Reckeweg.

24
00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:07.331
One of his associates that worked with him

25
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:08.868
was Otto Warburg.

26
00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.328
Otto Warburg, the only man in history

27
00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:12.173
to win two Nobel prizes in medicine.

28
00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:14.379
Very few people have ever heard of him.

29
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:15.932
This has been stuff I've been studying

30
00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:18.342
for about 25, 30 years.

31
00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:21.441
It's a pattern of disease, there are six steps to disease,

32
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.297
according to homotoxicology.

33
00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:26.155
I've been trying to prove this pattern.

34
00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:29.085
Examples of that is, basically,

35
00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:30.840
what homotoxicology says,

36
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.861
the body gets a noxious agent.

37
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.008
Well, the first thing it does, it tries to excrete it.

38
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:36.809
You have a diarrhea, you throw it up, whatever,

39
00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:39.135
as your nose runs, that tries to come out.

40
00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:41.877
Now, if the body can't excrete it,

41
00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:44.340
it then creates an inflammation to heal it.

42
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.644
Very, very, very, very important.

43
00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:49.642
If it can't heal it, the problem gets deposited,

44
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.187
gets impregnated into the tissue,

45
00:01:51.187 --> 00:01:53.170
the tissue then starts to break down,

46
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.962
and the tissue dies.

47
00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:57.469
Inflammation is the real key.

48
00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.722
If you cut your leg, and I'm a surgeon, and I sew it up,

49
00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:03.249
that just aligns it, it's the body healing it

50
00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.724
by an inflammatory process.

51
00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:09.020
So what's gone on, though, is inflammation a key?

52
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.359
So I'm trying to, with 25, 30 years,

53
00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.580
trying to put that together, how are we proving that.

54
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.101
Well, what comes on in the past couple of years

55
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:21.577
is finally the proof to the pudding of what goes on.

56
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.396
I've been studying the blood, as you know, okay?

57
00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:28.012
And in the blood you can see inflammation by the platelets.

58
00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:29.217
You can actually see different things.

59
00:02:29.217 --> 00:02:30.475
Platelets, were taught in medicine,

60
00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:32.194
have to do with blood clotting.

61
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.899
However, we're never taught that platelets

62
00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.571
have no animal DNA in them, it's a plant, okay?

63
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:41.392
A plant, now, and man have an instinct symbiosis.

64
00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:43.418
What happens with the platelets as we get acutely ill

65
00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:45.051
they become larger and more numerous.

66
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:47.094
Chronically ill, weaker and weaker.

67
00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:50.656
There a major key to our immune system what's going on.

68
00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:51.777
I could show you a picture of platelets,

69
00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:54.005
very large platelets, and very small platelets,

70
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.542
different stage of disease,

71
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.784
but the medical standard will still count them as one.

72
00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:00.939
The size of it, no one has ever looked at.

73
00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.640
But by following the platelets you can see the inflammation.

74
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.742
Now, inflammation, again, the key.

75
00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:09.141
So I've been following this for years and years.

76
00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:12.488
But what goes on, now how can I prove that I'm right?

77
00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:15.168
The key comes in about two years ago,

78
00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:17.973
just almost right after our last interview

79
00:03:17.973 --> 00:03:20.414
when a friend of my daughters calls me up,

80
00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:23.626
and she just got a diagnosis of Hepatitis C.

81
00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:26.665
30 year old gal, she is petrified.

82
00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.909
Scripps wants to give her Interferon, chemotherapy,

83
00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.553
they got her on a transplant list,

84
00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:33.898
the woman is shook to the bones.

85
00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:37.258
She comes up to see me, and I start to examine her,

86
00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:40.074
and her blood is just a mess.

87
00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:41.269
But low and behold,

88
00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.071
and you can get the picture on the screen,

89
00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:45.471
but the holograph blood may be a little too difficult.

90
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:50.089
That picture is an actual, shows a picture of an IUD.

91
00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:53.928
This woman had an IUD, these intrauterine devices.

92
00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:56.871
Now, the purpose of an IUD is to create an inflammation,

93
00:03:56.871 --> 00:04:00.044
to swell the tissue so the egg can't implant.

94
00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:03.570
She's been uncomfortable since she had the IUD in,

95
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.618
this is June, in January she had it put in,

96
00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:07.728
we take the IUD out.

97
00:04:07.728 --> 00:04:09.567
No other treatment was done,

98
00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:14.199
a year later her viral load is down 70%.

99
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:15.709
Wow.

100
00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:16.862
<v Regina>Amazing, 70%, not doing anything,</v>

101
00:04:16.862 --> 00:04:18.942
but just taking the IUD out.

102
00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:22.636
<v ->Just taking the IUD out, wow.</v>

103
00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:25.130
<v Regina>Wow, I mean, this has to have implications</v>

104
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.263
for millions upon millions of women.

105
00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:29.961
<v ->That's what starts to totally shake me up.</v>

106
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:32.117
First of all, I start to do more IUD studies

107
00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:33.876
besides Hepatitis studies.

108
00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:38.027
I now have five women with ovarian cancers that had IUD's.

109
00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:40.176
One goes to her support group,

110
00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:43.189
five out of the nine had IUD's.

111
00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:48.003
Every woman that has had an IUD has had sequelling.

112
00:04:48.003 --> 00:04:49.773
Some have had miscarriages afterwards,

113
00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:51.874
they can't hold the baby afterwards.

114
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:55.569
My wife ended up with a bad hysterectomy

115
00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.226
that was almost an emergency because of what it did to her.

116
00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:01.327
These things just almost eat away at the system,

117
00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:03.822
and then the inflammation leaches out,

118
00:05:03.822 --> 00:05:06.091
the inflammation leaches out into the pelvis,

119
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:08.544
and they have problems with them.

120
00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:10.540
I have IUD's, women with IUD's,

121
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.947
that have created blood diseases like leukemias.

122
00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:17.239
Again, Hepatitis C, very common.

123
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:19.861
Most IUD ones have had chronic problems

124
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.836
even to the Lyme disease, I have several with that

125
00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:24.673
depending on how bad the inflammation was.

126
00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:28.182
Doctors are giving IUD's to create an inflammation.

127
00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:29.621
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

128
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.476
<v ->Frightening.</v>

129
00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:32.395
<v Regina>Right, it is frightening.</v>

130
00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.280
At this point, is it fair to ask, okay,

131
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.903
that's scary for anyone who's just heard that

132
00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:37.820
and has an IUD.

133
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.047
Other than taking them out,

134
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.380
is that all that needs to be done,

135
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.282
or can something be done?

136
00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:43.575
What if you end up with ovarian cancer as a result

137
00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:44.993
of the IUD?
<v Harvey>Well, we've done,</v>

138
00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:46.774
ovarian cancer, number one cancer's

139
00:05:46.774 --> 00:05:48.236
not one cell that goes wild.

140
00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:49.963
We've talked about that before.

141
00:05:49.963 --> 00:05:51.159
It's a bowl.

142
00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.654
What goes on in ovarian cancer is

143
00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.552
the whole lower pelvic area,

144
00:05:55.552 --> 00:05:58.773
and the uterus, gets really inflamed, gets congested.

145
00:05:58.773 --> 00:06:00.172
That backs up through the tubes,

146
00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:02.348
which drop into the peritoneum,

147
00:06:02.348 --> 00:06:06.043
and ovarian cancer starts its seeds throughout the belly.

148
00:06:06.528 --> 00:06:07.894
And that's what it is, it's the bowl,

149
00:06:07.894 --> 00:06:09.514
the whole belly area.

150
00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:10.731
And when that gets overwhelmed

151
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:13.237
it finally starts to spread in different ways.

152
00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:15.531
But ovarian cancer, I'm convinced,

153
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:18.356
which by the way is one of the cancers on the rise now.

154
00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:19.509
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v Harvey>Okay?</v>

155
00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.769
<v Harvey>I'm convinced it has to do with what's gone on</v>

156
00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:23.552
and put into women's pelvises.

157
00:06:23.552 --> 00:06:25.632
<v ->Okay, let's extend it from there</v>

158
00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:27.914
while we're on this subject, what about tampons?

159
00:06:27.914 --> 00:06:28.874
<v ->I think all of that.</v>

160
00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:30.613
Women, for the first time in history,

161
00:06:30.613 --> 00:06:32.670
their lifespans are going down.

162
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.687
Most women over the age of 51, half now,

163
00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.330
are getting hysterectomies.

164
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.366
C-sections, probably up to 50% of women

165
00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:40.372
have gone through C-sections.

166
00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:44.449
In the 1960's, women wanted all their equal rights

167
00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.566
and freedoms, so men ran the system and said,

168
00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:50.105
"Great, we'll give them the pill, we'll give them the IUD,

169
00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:52.025
"we'll cut their tubes, we'll give them the abortion."

170
00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.702
Because the man didn't want to wear the condom, okay?

171
00:06:54.702 --> 00:06:55.225
<v Regina>Right.</v>

172
00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:57.060
<v ->I tell my patients,</v>

173
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.563
"If the guy doesn't want to wear a condom,

174
00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.303
"get rid of him, 'cause 100 others will line up

175
00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:02.202
"around the corner wanting to wear one."

176
00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:03.375
<v Regina>Right, there you go,</v>

177
00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.241
some good, practical advice on all of us.

178
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:06.563
<v ->That's just basic and simple.</v>

179
00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:07.215
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

180
00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:08.721
<v ->Don't mess with Mother Nature.</v>

181
00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:11.343
The tampons are causing a congestion.

182
00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:14.789
HPV, Human Papillomavirus is skyrocketing.

183
00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.860
I've now got several people where they come in,

184
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.442
they have a problem and they go in and get a pap smear,

185
00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:22.041
they have problems with the cervix.

186
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.400
Cervical cancer's rare, but they're all pre-cancerous.

187
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.342
They then do something to the cervix.

188
00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:29.814
I now have several people with Hepatitis C's

189
00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:31.829
after cauterizing the cervix.

190
00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:33.535
<v Regina>After cauterizing, after the procedure</v>

191
00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:35.050
cauterizing the cervix?
<v Harvey>Right.</v>

192
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.848
<v Harvey>Right, cervix is very inflammatory.</v>

193
00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:41.450
The surface, or the opening of any tissue,

194
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.754
you break the surface or the opening of any tissue,

195
00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:46.612
inflammation happens very fast.

196
00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:49.130
The cervix, you start to mess around with that,

197
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.571
a lot of sequelling can go on over there.

198
00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.535
Doctors say, "No big deal."

199
00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:57.173
<v Regina>But now, the conventional wisdom has been</v>

200
00:07:57.173 --> 00:07:59.850
this is something you catch through,

201
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.210
whether usually a transfusion or something, the Hepatitis C,

202
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.671
so you're saying this is not the case.

203
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:06.875
Tell us how this happens.

204
00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:08.817
<v ->Well, number one, it's never been proven.</v>

205
00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:10.715
Years ago when I went to medical school,

206
00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:13.413
we used to have what's called Koch's postulates.

207
00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:14.767
The only way to prove--

208
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:15.334
<v Regina>Say that again.</v>

209
00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:17.807
<v ->Koch's postulates, K-O-C-H postulates.</v>

210
00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:18.649
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

211
00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:20.611
<v ->What it is, you had laws on it.</v>

212
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:22.926
You had to find, to prove a germ-caused disease,

213
00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:25.791
you had to find the germ in every patient.

214
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:27.668
You then had to be able to isolate the germ,

215
00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:30.781
and grow it in an aug jar, a petri plate, or something.

216
00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:32.509
And then you take that germ and you have to

217
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:35.442
transfer the disease to a laboratory animal.

218
00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:36.969
They stopped doing that.

219
00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:39.968
Now all they do is do an antibody test.

220
00:08:39.968 --> 00:08:42.319
Well, what does that really mean?

221
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:44.117
What does that really mean?

222
00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:47.520
How does this, I got one patient, which is a great case,

223
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.178
she came in in January,

224
00:08:51.258 --> 00:08:53.588
bad Hepatitis C, okay?

225
00:08:53.588 --> 00:08:56.235
Again, on a transplant list.

226
00:08:56.235 --> 00:09:00.608
1974, violently raped, beaten up,

227
00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:03.232
transfusions in the hospital, okay?

228
00:09:03.232 --> 00:09:04.790
That really started it.

229
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.677
She came in, in January her viral load

230
00:09:06.677 --> 00:09:08.395
was 12 and a half million.

231
00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:11.690
Her viral load is now over 400,000 only.

232
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.436
<v Regina>Wow, huge.</v>

233
00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:15.029
<v ->No treatment on the virus.</v>

234
00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:19.461
Not one antiviral treatment, okay?

235
00:09:19.461 --> 00:09:22.671
How can medical science explain the viral loads

236
00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:24.933
decreasing in my patients

237
00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:27.759
without doing any antiviral treatments?

238
00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:30.884
And, they don't have any treatments

239
00:09:30.884 --> 00:09:32.943
that will lower a viral load.

240
00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:34.246
They just wait for you to get the transplant.

241
00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:35.572
<v Regina>Well Hepatitis C is sort of,</v>

242
00:09:35.572 --> 00:09:36.969
there's a death warrant on that one.

243
00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:38.624
<v ->Totally, totally.</v>

244
00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:40.084
<v Regina>But that's not your experience?</v>

245
00:09:40.084 --> 00:09:42.206
<v ->No, I've now got six patients,</v>

246
00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:44.446
and every single one of them is getting better.

247
00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:46.964
Every single one of them, the viral load is dropping,

248
00:09:46.964 --> 00:09:48.009
and every single one of them

249
00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:49.865
the lab tests are getting better.

250
00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:52.744
It is a massive, rapid inflammation.

251
00:09:52.744 --> 00:09:54.483
What I think that goes on,

252
00:09:54.483 --> 00:09:57.023
the inflammation is so strong and so hard at the beginning

253
00:09:57.023 --> 00:09:59.368
it almost burns the protein in liver.

254
00:09:59.368 --> 00:09:59.827
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

255
00:09:59.827 --> 00:10:02.828
<v ->I think the liver RNA Protein actually gets burnt</v>

256
00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:05.547
and becomes quote, the Hepatitis C virus.

257
00:10:05.547 --> 00:10:07.489
<v Regina>Oh, interesting.</v>

258
00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:08.054
<v ->Danny Kaye says--</v>

259
00:10:08.054 --> 00:10:10.864
<v Regina>So the burnt protein becomes</v>

260
00:10:10.864 --> 00:10:11.955
the Hepatitis C?
<v Harvey>Actually.</v>

261
00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:14.039
RNA Protein is just pieces of protein

262
00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.500
that are stuck together.

263
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.839
Well, in the body, those little guys that move in the blood?

264
00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:20.140
They're just pieces of protein,

265
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.839
they can form RNA and DNA chains.

266
00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:24.086
What you've got in Hepatitis C,

267
00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:28.005
it's an RNA Protein, you know, that's what it is.

268
00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:31.451
Once that happened in the liver protein chains,

269
00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:33.812
that's why we have that protein.

270
00:10:33.812 --> 00:10:36.701
Was that liver protein so burnt

271
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:39.929
that it just sort of morphed, and the molecule changed,

272
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:41.294
and now it's a virus?

273
00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:42.628
<v Regina>Well now let's talk about</v>

274
00:10:42.628 --> 00:10:45.412
not just the incidents we've already spoken of,

275
00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:47.449
and IUD's and so forth, and brutal rapes,

276
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:51.530
but what are other means which could cause

277
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.816
that kind of effect in the other situations?

278
00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:57.857
<v ->I have a guy that lives in a ski country,</v>

279
00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.662
20 some odd years, 30 years ago, he goes off a cliff

280
00:11:00.662 --> 00:11:03.336
on a toboggan, crashes down, unconscious,

281
00:11:03.336 --> 00:11:04.765
brought into the hospital.

282
00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.198
But he's got some tears of blood vessels in his chest,

283
00:11:07.198 --> 00:11:09.181
so they go, it's called the hemothorax,

284
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:10.660
they put a tube in to drain the blood,

285
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.358
and they give him a transfusion, he gets Hepatitis C.

286
00:11:13.358 --> 00:11:14.883
They say it's from the transfusion.

287
00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.080
No, it was from the tearing in the blood vessels

288
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.660
and the inflammation.

289
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.964
He's getting better rapidly.

290
00:11:20.964 --> 00:11:24.899
I've now got several cases of pilonidal cysts.

291
00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:28.483
A pilonidal cyst is a little cyst at the base of the spine.

292
00:11:28.483 --> 00:11:30.467
Now what happens is, we know a hair lip

293
00:11:30.467 --> 00:11:33.325
is an incomplete closure up in the mouth.

294
00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:36.344
Well a pilonidal cyst is the spinal cord column

295
00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:37.880
and the bones don't close completely,

296
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.601
and you get a microhole.

297
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:40.344
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

298
00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:41.480
<v ->The fluid leaks out of that.</v>

299
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.124
When they go after an infected cyst,

300
00:11:44.124 --> 00:11:46.247
they stir up the pus and put it right back

301
00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.199
into the cerebral spinal fluid.

302
00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:50.142
I have one guy, six months afterwards,

303
00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.186
starts to get weak.

304
00:11:51.186 --> 00:11:53.298
He's now got total paralysis.

305
00:11:53.298 --> 00:11:55.366
He's a quadriplegic and muscular dystrophy.

306
00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:58.524
His whole spinal cord melted away.

307
00:11:58.524 --> 00:12:02.780
I have a relative of mine who is probably

308
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.582
one of the cleanest people you will ever meet.

309
00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:07.046
A major chiropractic man,

310
00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:09.425
a big shot in the association and everything.

311
00:12:09.425 --> 00:12:11.580
Has a pilonidal cyst surgery, six months later,

312
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.457
positive Hepatitis C.

313
00:12:13.457 --> 00:12:16.464
This guy would never touch anything, okay?

314
00:12:16.464 --> 00:12:19.105
Pilonidal cyst surgeries,

315
00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.568
I have two Hepatitis C from that.

316
00:12:21.568 --> 00:12:23.616
I have one leukemia from that,

317
00:12:23.616 --> 00:12:25.238
and another lymphoma from that.

318
00:12:25.238 --> 00:12:27.692
That's another one, blood diseases.

319
00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:29.697
I have blood diseases from pilonidal cysts.

320
00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:32.053
I've got lists over there of people

321
00:12:32.053 --> 00:12:34.500
that are due bunion surgery.

322
00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:36.810
I got two people with bunion surgery

323
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.724
that get leukemias.

324
00:12:39.088 --> 00:12:40.933
And you treat the bunion,

325
00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:42.854
the blood count starts to change.

326
00:12:42.854 --> 00:12:45.797
Surgery, the more surgeries involving wet tissue,

327
00:12:45.797 --> 00:12:48.399
the more inflammation there is, okay?

328
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:50.106
And bunions, there are a lot of tendons in the feet,

329
00:12:50.106 --> 00:12:52.068
and stuff like that, as soon as they do that,

330
00:12:52.068 --> 00:12:54.036
massive inflammation.

331
00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:56.111
They blow off surgery, no big deal.

332
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:58.554
Doctors today, what's going on with doctors today,

333
00:12:58.554 --> 00:13:01.412
is they're doing more surgeries ever in history,

334
00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:03.663
because the only way a doctor can make money now,

335
00:13:03.663 --> 00:13:06.361
with insurances the way they are, is to do surgery.

336
00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:08.843
<v Regina>Okay, yeah, it's obvious--</v>

337
00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:09.842
<v ->It's, I mean,</v>

338
00:13:09.842 --> 00:13:12.322
I was on a plane recently,
<v Regina>Criminal.</v>

339
00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:14.104
and there on the plane, you look at a magazine,

340
00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:16.213
and the top ten doctors in New York City.

341
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:17.720
The top one does hair transplants,

342
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.942
the next one liposuction, the next one botox,

343
00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:23.256
this is not healthcare, folks.

344
00:13:23.256 --> 00:13:25.495
This is barbaric cosmetology.

345
00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:26.157
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

346
00:13:26.157 --> 00:13:28.397
<v ->The nerve and the arrogance of the system</v>

347
00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:31.852
to say we can make God's creation better

348
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:33.708
by doing this and doing that to it.

349
00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:36.897
And whether you believe in God, or evolution,

350
00:13:36.897 --> 00:13:38.349
this is a wonderful creation.

351
00:13:38.349 --> 00:13:39.853
<v Regina>Millions of people are buying into it</v>

352
00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:42.753
and having all these elective surgeries, you know?

353
00:13:42.753 --> 00:13:44.513
Whether you need your eyebrows heightened,

354
00:13:44.513 --> 00:13:49.078
or the fat sucked off of your rear end, or whatever.

355
00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.275
<v ->The reason they're doing those is they can't make money</v>

356
00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:53.120
and they're failures at everything else.

357
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.904
And now they're taken out appendixes just willy-nilly.

358
00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:57.621
"While we're there we'll take out the uterus,

359
00:13:57.621 --> 00:13:59.189
"while we're there we'll take out the gallbladder,

360
00:13:59.189 --> 00:14:00.821
"you don't need these things."

361
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.157
Well, if you didn't need the gallbladder

362
00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:04.056
the Creator wouldn't have put it in there.

363
00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:07.374
How pompous and arrogant are you?

364
00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:10.008
And it's since 1910 that traditional medicine

365
00:14:10.008 --> 00:14:11.352
has taken over.

366
00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:12.589
Do you know they haven't found the cause

367
00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:14.476
of one chronic disease since 1910,

368
00:14:14.476 --> 00:14:16.589
nor the cure of one chronic disease?

369
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.108
What makes them the experts?

370
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:19.132
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

371
00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:22.107
Let's go back a bit again to the liver,

372
00:14:22.107 --> 00:14:23.664
and how the cycle works.

373
00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:27.088
So you have a surgery, you have inflammation in the body.

374
00:14:27.088 --> 00:14:29.350
How does that trigger this burning

375
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.815
of the RNA Protein in the liver?

376
00:14:32.825 --> 00:14:34.093
Do you have any idea how that happens?

377
00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:36.033
<v ->That's my theoretical thing,</v>

378
00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:37.514
'cause first, what is inflammation?

379
00:14:37.514 --> 00:14:39.188
It's fire.
<v Regina>Fire, yeah.</v>

380
00:14:39.188 --> 00:14:40.830
<v Harvey>Okay, in acupuncture philosophy</v>

381
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.038
we have five elements, fire, air, water, earth, and wood.

382
00:14:44.038 --> 00:14:48.037
Well fire, whatever it is, that body's on fire, okay?

383
00:14:48.037 --> 00:14:51.919
So something happened, but it was an acute, heavy hit.

384
00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:55.866
The inflammation of a Hepatitis C is a heavy fire.

385
00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.664
Hepatitis A, mild surgery, mild injury,

386
00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:02.066
may cause a Hepatitis A, it doesn't give you much symptoms.

387
00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:04.864
But it's the bigger ones, the really intense hits.

388
00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:06.475
<v Regina>The bigger traumas and such.</v>

389
00:15:06.475 --> 00:15:08.235
<v ->Right, right, and it's usually,</v>

390
00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:10.783
you can almost tell it from the case, by the history,

391
00:15:10.783 --> 00:15:13.196
six months to a year before they were diagnosed

392
00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:15.538
you can almost find that trauma right on the history.

393
00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:19.518
<v Regina>So, the example you gave of the women with IUD's,</v>

394
00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:23.016
and the one in particular, your daughter's friend,

395
00:15:23.016 --> 00:15:26.717
she took the IUD out, immediately her blood starts clearing.

396
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:27.272
<v ->Right.</v>

397
00:15:27.272 --> 00:15:30.673
<v Regina>Okay, how are the others getting reversals</v>

398
00:15:30.673 --> 00:15:32.093
of this that you're talking about?

399
00:15:32.093 --> 00:15:34.450
You said you're having no problem working

400
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.911
with people with Hepatitis C.

401
00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:38.375
<v ->First you got to find where the inflammation is.</v>

402
00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:40.476
If it's a surgery, like a pilonidal cyst,

403
00:15:40.476 --> 00:15:43.933
you go treat the surgical area and start to neutralize it.

404
00:15:43.933 --> 00:15:45.937
If it's an IUD, you gotta go treat that,

405
00:15:45.937 --> 00:15:47.173
that's called neural therapy,

406
00:15:47.173 --> 00:15:49.591
there's ways you actually gotta go in to the tissue

407
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:52.021
and start, again, you gotta treat it like a car.

408
00:15:52.021 --> 00:15:53.696
You just can't pray on it,

409
00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:55.091
you got to physically change some of

410
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:57.098
that structure of the tissue.

411
00:15:57.098 --> 00:16:00.332
What we have is, we have electrical flows and fluid flows

412
00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:02.507
that are going through the entire body.

413
00:16:02.507 --> 00:16:04.907
To me, the greatest American physician of all time

414
00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:08.267
was the founder of Osteopathy, Andrew Taylor Still,

415
00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.368
who stated, "Disease cannot exist

416
00:16:10.368 --> 00:16:12.694
"when there are no obstructions."

417
00:16:12.694 --> 00:16:14.975
In the obstruction, you got a stagnant pond,

418
00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:17.738
in the stagnant pond, everything grows.

419
00:16:18.368 --> 00:16:20.421
Find the obstruction.

420
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:23.542
Most commonly it's a surgical area.

421
00:16:23.542 --> 00:16:25.803
Nothing goes through the surgery.

422
00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:29.088
The whole body expands and contracts like a water balloon.

423
00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:31.210
Surgeries tie it up, and tie it into knots.

424
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.970
As soon as you release the surgical area,

425
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.581
the body can open up the circulation,

426
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:38.048
and get at the area that's been knotted up.

427
00:16:38.048 --> 00:16:39.903
<v Regina>And even if it's just something like</v>

428
00:16:39.903 --> 00:16:43.061
surgery on the shoulder, it doesn't have to be a cesarean,

429
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:44.383
or anything that dramatic.

430
00:16:44.383 --> 00:16:45.705
Even something small like that?

431
00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:48.266
<v ->Joint surgery is very inflammatory.</v>

432
00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:49.826
I said the wet tissue.

433
00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:50.566
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

434
00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:52.286
<v ->You're gonna watch these baby boomers</v>

435
00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:54.718
go through knee surgeries, and hip surgeries,

436
00:16:54.718 --> 00:16:57.341
'cause all it is jogging, which is crazy.

437
00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:59.232
And as they did that,

438
00:16:59.232 --> 00:17:01.850
I have a gal there who's a Christian Scientist,

439
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.306
90 years old, very athletic, okay?

440
00:17:05.306 --> 00:17:07.631
Knee surgery, Hepatitis C.

441
00:17:07.981 --> 00:17:12.459
Never taken a drug in 90 years, okay?

442
00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:14.892
Surgeries can be very inflammatory.

443
00:17:14.892 --> 00:17:17.196
Every person that's had a knee surgery,

444
00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:20.907
the knee may feel better, but the body's weaker

445
00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:22.625
because of what's gone on.

446
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.481
As soon as you treat the knee surgery

447
00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:27.264
you start to see, "Do I feel that much better?"

448
00:17:27.264 --> 00:17:29.866
Yes, as soon as you start to clear up the inflammation.

449
00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.403
<v Regina>But clearing the inflammation</v>

450
00:17:31.403 --> 00:17:34.420
is not necessarily readily available in the way

451
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.445
in which you do it.

452
00:17:35.445 --> 00:17:36.352
<v ->No.</v>

453
00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.286
<v Regina>See, that's our problem here.</v>

454
00:17:38.286 --> 00:17:40.622
It's great that this has been identified.

455
00:17:41.912 --> 00:17:44.461
What do you see down the road in terms of

456
00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:47.181
other people expanding into this knowledge base

457
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:49.442
that you have and offering these therapies

458
00:17:49.442 --> 00:17:50.519
that will actually medicate this.

459
00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:51.780
<v ->Well there's two things.</v>

460
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.893
First thing I want to do is stop people,

461
00:17:53.893 --> 00:17:56.411
start to question this doctor, this expert,

462
00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:58.466
who hasn't fixed a thing in a hundred years.

463
00:17:58.466 --> 00:17:59.203
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

464
00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.283
<v ->You're being brainwashed, and you gotta do this,</v>

465
00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:02.563
you gotta do that.

466
00:18:02.563 --> 00:18:04.546
Orthodontia, I mean, they're cutting our teeth,

467
00:18:04.546 --> 00:18:06.597
they're throwing teeth away 'cause they say

468
00:18:06.597 --> 00:18:08.315
the Creator put too many teeth in your mouth

469
00:18:08.315 --> 00:18:09.499
when you're a little child and--

470
00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:11.152
<v Regina>And what kind of problems does this cause?</v>

471
00:18:11.152 --> 00:18:13.434
<v ->Oh, it collapses the whole cranial mechanism,</v>

472
00:18:13.434 --> 00:18:15.397
it just shuts everything down, you know?

473
00:18:15.397 --> 00:18:16.815
This cranial osteopathy,

474
00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:18.874
the tailbone moves about a millimeter,

475
00:18:18.874 --> 00:18:20.336
eight to 10 times a minute.

476
00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:22.138
You got waves of cerebral spinal fluid are coming

477
00:18:22.138 --> 00:18:24.272
up and down the spinal canal,

478
00:18:24.272 --> 00:18:26.159
and there's 22 bones that make up the skull

479
00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:28.313
that are actually hinged and moving.

480
00:18:28.313 --> 00:18:30.319
As soon as you cut the mouth down

481
00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:31.630
and pull those teeth out,

482
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.612
you collapse the base of the skull.

483
00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.425
My friend, my dental friend says,

484
00:18:35.425 --> 00:18:37.388
"You collapse the base to the temple,

485
00:18:37.388 --> 00:18:38.720
"and now the brain is working on five

486
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.288
"out of eight cylinders."

487
00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:42.187
And you see these people just walking around

488
00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.606
like deers in headlights.

489
00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:44.683
<v Regina>And a lot of people have this done</v>

490
00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:47.328
with their kids in order to get this perfect mouth.

491
00:18:47.328 --> 00:18:48.523
<v ->This is the new thing.</v>

492
00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:51.104
Everyone is doing that, putting the kids on botox,

493
00:18:51.104 --> 00:18:52.501
cutting the kids on their mouth.

494
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:54.757
The United States is the only dental country

495
00:18:54.757 --> 00:18:56.538
that takes the teeth out.

496
00:18:56.538 --> 00:18:58.618
If braces can straighten the teeth out,

497
00:18:58.618 --> 00:19:00.580
like my dear friend in Canada,

498
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.500
he uses braces to expand the mouth,

499
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.378
and the crowded mouth all of a sudden opens up

500
00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:05.842
and the teeth come in straight.

501
00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:07.101
<v Regina>Well that makes more sense.</v>

502
00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:08.403
<v ->It totally makes more sense.</v>

503
00:19:08.403 --> 00:19:09.959
The concept of throwing away stuff

504
00:19:09.959 --> 00:19:11.708
that we were created with is crazy.

505
00:19:11.708 --> 00:19:13.564
<v Regina>So have there been any studies or links</v>

506
00:19:13.564 --> 00:19:18.162
between the removal of teeth and say, if not IQ,

507
00:19:18.162 --> 00:19:20.828
but functionality any way of kids?

508
00:19:20.828 --> 00:19:22.644
<v ->Not yet at the moment.</v>

509
00:19:22.644 --> 00:19:24.042
This is the things that I want to do.

510
00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:27.561
I find about almost 30% of my Lyme disease

511
00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:29.685
have had orthodontia with braces.

512
00:19:29.685 --> 00:19:31.294
<v Regina>Oh, let's get into Lyme disease then.</v>

513
00:19:31.294 --> 00:19:31.871
<v ->Okay.</v>

514
00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:33.406
<v Regina>Okay, there's one start.</v>

515
00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:34.587
Go ahead and talk about that.

516
00:19:34.587 --> 00:19:36.198
<v ->Lyme disease is a phenomenon more</v>

517
00:19:36.198 --> 00:19:37.894
in the past two decades.

518
00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:39.995
And what's going on is because there are so many more

519
00:19:39.995 --> 00:19:42.651
elective surgeries, okay?

520
00:19:42.651 --> 00:19:44.447
There are minor elective surgeries.

521
00:19:44.447 --> 00:19:46.840
Let's straighten the teeth out, okay?

522
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.279
While we're there, let's do this,

523
00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:50.936
you don't need your appendix, we don't need the uterus,

524
00:19:50.936 --> 00:19:53.464
let's do this little cosmetic surgery.

525
00:19:53.464 --> 00:19:56.524
I have a list over there from dental surgeries,

526
00:19:56.524 --> 00:20:00.844
to vasectomies, which are elective, to IUD's,

527
00:20:00.844 --> 00:20:05.261
to hysterectomies, auto accidents, carpal tunnel surgeries,

528
00:20:05.261 --> 00:20:07.319
all of these have weakened the body.

529
00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:10.700
You cannot cut the body and expect it to get better.

530
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.863
It's weakened the body,

531
00:20:11.863 --> 00:20:14.380
and the germ just grows in the weakened body.

532
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.257
And the more surgeries you have,

533
00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.516
the more weakened bodies we have,

534
00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:19.500
and the United States is now the capital

535
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.302
of Lyme disease in the world.

536
00:20:21.302 --> 00:20:23.147
<v Regina>Now let's talk about Lyme disease.</v>

537
00:20:23.147 --> 00:20:25.460
Conventional wisdom, you go out for a nice little hike

538
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.161
in the woods, a tick gets ya, and you have Lyme disease.

539
00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:32.563
<v ->Well, only about 50 to 70% of the Lyme disease people</v>

540
00:20:32.563 --> 00:20:34.398
even remember a tick.

541
00:20:34.398 --> 00:20:35.784
They're blaming it on a tick.

542
00:20:35.784 --> 00:20:37.555
We like to blame everything on something else.

543
00:20:37.555 --> 00:20:38.558
<v Regina>Right, right. (laughing)</v>

544
00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.434
<v ->You know, Hepatitis C is from the transfusion,</v>

545
00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:41.939
this is from a tick.

546
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:43.357
Our emotions never have to do anything.

547
00:20:43.357 --> 00:20:46.986
You accidentally got cancer, you accidentally got an ulcer.

548
00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:49.184
No, there is no accidents in nature.

549
00:20:49.184 --> 00:20:51.520
There's a law and order to nature.

550
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.163
But according to American medicine,

551
00:20:53.163 --> 00:20:56.245
cancer's one cell that goes wild, for no reason.

552
00:20:56.245 --> 00:20:59.818
Grows into a tumor, which erodes into a blood vessel,

553
00:20:59.818 --> 00:21:01.759
cells break off and they scatter around,

554
00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.902
and that's called matastities.

555
00:21:03.902 --> 00:21:05.205
Totally wrong.

556
00:21:05.205 --> 00:21:07.636
For example, prostate cancer only goes to the bones.

557
00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:08.938
It'll go to 100 spots in the bones

558
00:21:08.938 --> 00:21:10.900
before it goes anyplace else.

559
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.510
Their theories are random.

560
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.731
There's no randomness in nature,

561
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:18.368
randomness in nature is arrogance.

562
00:21:18.368 --> 00:21:19.669
<v Regina>Yes, yes, absolutely.</v>

563
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:21.823
<v ->It's total arrogance, the nerve of you.</v>

564
00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.509
<v Regina>Yes, they don't understand consciousness</v>

565
00:21:23.509 --> 00:21:24.949
at the base of all things.

566
00:21:24.949 --> 00:21:26.548
<v ->Yeah, you don't understand harmony</v>

567
00:21:26.548 --> 00:21:27.994
with man and nature.

568
00:21:27.994 --> 00:21:30.277
You don't respect this body that you're cutting it up

569
00:21:30.277 --> 00:21:31.620
and throwing it away?

570
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.119
And then blaming it on someone else or something else.

571
00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:37.199
<v Regina>So talk about the symptoms of Lyme disease.</v>

572
00:21:37.199 --> 00:21:40.100
Let's get into it and find out where some of the other

573
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.202
cases of Lyme disease have popped up.

574
00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:43.780
<v ->Well, the beauty of Lyme disease is</v>

575
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.727
there's 1,000 patients who have 1,000 different symptoms.

576
00:21:46.727 --> 00:21:47.315
It's totally--

577
00:21:47.315 --> 00:21:49.564
<v Regina>Is it one of those kind of garbage diagnosis?</v>

578
00:21:49.564 --> 00:21:51.228
<v ->If you have surgery in your belly,</v>

579
00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:52.743
your symptoms will be in the abdomen.

580
00:21:52.743 --> 00:21:54.225
If you have surgery up in your shoulder,

581
00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:55.942
your symptoms will be up there.

582
00:21:55.942 --> 00:21:57.084
Depending on where your--

583
00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:58.470
<v Regina>And what are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</v>

584
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.942
<v ->Well most of them have chronic pain.</v>

585
00:21:59.942 --> 00:22:02.609
If I cut your nerves you're gonna have pain down there.

586
00:22:02.609 --> 00:22:04.276
Most of them have fatigue.

587
00:22:04.276 --> 00:22:05.631
So these pains are wandering,

588
00:22:05.631 --> 00:22:07.218
no one knows where the pain's coming from.

589
00:22:07.218 --> 00:22:08.851
They're fatigued because now they're only working

590
00:22:08.851 --> 00:22:10.269
on five out of eight cylinders.

591
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:12.456
<v Regina>So you're saying it's not a pathogen</v>

592
00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:13.950
of some kind.
<v Harvey>No.</v>

593
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.213
<v Regina>So how do they even come up with this diagnosis?</v>

594
00:22:17.213 --> 00:22:20.475
<v ->Um, I don't know, to tell you honestly.</v>

595
00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:21.743
You look on the internet showing

596
00:22:21.743 --> 00:22:23.378
all these spirochetes in the blood?

597
00:22:23.378 --> 00:22:24.658
That's a lot of bologna.

598
00:22:24.658 --> 00:22:26.563
I can show you the lies in the blood.

599
00:22:26.563 --> 00:22:28.504
How do they come up with, and a lot of the internet,

600
00:22:28.504 --> 00:22:30.967
all this stuff travels around the internet,

601
00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:34.381
and some people guess and make up stories.

602
00:22:34.381 --> 00:22:37.623
All I can tell you, germ theory disease doesn't work,

603
00:22:37.623 --> 00:22:41.048
and now on these diseases, Lyme disease, Hepatitis C,

604
00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:43.390
I've now got leukemias and lymphomas

605
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.442
that we're reversing, okay?

606
00:22:46.442 --> 00:22:49.431
Those blood diseases we're reversing.

607
00:22:49.431 --> 00:22:50.712
<v Regina>And it's by the same methods?</v>

608
00:22:50.712 --> 00:22:51.490
<v ->Same method.</v>

609
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.855
<v Regina>Again, and you're saying this is as a result</v>

610
00:22:53.855 --> 00:22:56.667
of trauma and scarring from the surgery and so forth?

611
00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:59.896
<v ->Totally, from bunion, again, coming back to the chart,</v>

612
00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:03.445
inflammation's the key, it's trapped inflammation.

613
00:23:04.274 --> 00:23:08.509
All chronic disease starts with trapped inflammation.

614
00:23:08.509 --> 00:23:09.255
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

615
00:23:09.255 --> 00:23:11.549
<v ->I had patients actually go get human stem cells,</v>

616
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:13.373
you gotta get them out of the country.

617
00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:16.327
The theory is stem cells go to the inflamed area to heal it.

618
00:23:16.327 --> 00:23:17.991
No, they go to the weakened area

619
00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:20.689
and create the inflammation to heal it.

620
00:23:20.689 --> 00:23:22.428
Inflammation's the way the body heals,

621
00:23:22.428 --> 00:23:24.315
trapped inflammation deteriorates.

622
00:23:24.315 --> 00:23:26.769
<v Regina>Uh-huh. Let's talk about cholesterol.</v>

623
00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:28.529
You and I talked about this off camera a bit.

624
00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:30.993
Kind of moving on to that whole myth.

625
00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:32.635
This is a big one, really.

626
00:23:32.635 --> 00:23:35.035
<v ->This is a classic example of the lies</v>

627
00:23:35.035 --> 00:23:36.368
of the establishment.

628
00:23:36.368 --> 00:23:38.416
And I call it the oh welling and brainwashing

629
00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.397
needs to happen.

630
00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:42.828
First of all, about two months ago, it was a two year study.

631
00:23:42.828 --> 00:23:45.144
The Metropolitan Diet, the Atkins Diet,

632
00:23:45.144 --> 00:23:47.223
and the Heart Association Diet.

633
00:23:47.223 --> 00:23:48.983
I knew Bob Atkins, he was brilliant.

634
00:23:48.983 --> 00:23:50.562
He was right on the money.

635
00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:53.484
His diet proved, it was the longest diet study ever,

636
00:23:53.484 --> 00:23:55.159
the most controlled diet study ever.

637
00:23:55.159 --> 00:23:57.120
His diet beat the American Heart Association

638
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.940
in cholesterols, weight loss, every parameter there was.

639
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.084
Within 24 hours everyone was still advertising

640
00:24:03.084 --> 00:24:05.762
lean foods on TV again, okay?

641
00:24:05.762 --> 00:24:10.762
And yet the fatty foods, so Atkins proved right.

642
00:24:11.003 --> 00:24:13.971
But what cholesterol is, let's talk about cholesterol.

643
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:18.971
Cholesterol is the, oh, it's the big evil right now, okay?

644
00:24:19.188 --> 00:24:21.449
Everyone is against cholesterol.

645
00:24:21.449 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Regina>Oh yeah, you can tell by watching the ads on TV.</v>

646
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.927
Lipitor and so forth.

647
00:24:25.927 --> 00:24:27.930
<v ->First of all, they've now shown Lipitor and Vytorin,</v>

648
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.286
after five years of study,

649
00:24:29.286 --> 00:24:30.758
have not helped one heart case yet.

650
00:24:30.758 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Regina>Okay, I didn't mean to interrupt you,</v>

651
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.757
but yes, let's go through all of that.

652
00:24:33.757 --> 00:24:35.976
<v ->Why are they still promoting it when they're showing</v>

653
00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:38.621
it has not helped heart disease, okay?

654
00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:41.778
What cholesterol is, when I went to medical school,

655
00:24:41.778 --> 00:24:44.007
the normal cholesterol was 180 to 240.

656
00:24:44.007 --> 00:24:45.842
Now they say it's under 200,

657
00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:46.962
and the lower they get the better,

658
00:24:46.962 --> 00:24:48.743
because cholesterol is just evil.

659
00:24:48.743 --> 00:24:49.498
No.

660
00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:52.930
First of all, the body, inflammation's the key.

661
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.370
What goes on in the blood vessels,

662
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.027
there's two keys to all vessel disease.

663
00:24:57.027 --> 00:24:58.765
It is the cholesterol, they say,

664
00:24:58.765 --> 00:25:02.082
and the C-reactive protein, or the inflammation.

665
00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:04.232
When there's a lot of inflammation,

666
00:25:04.232 --> 00:25:07.156
the blood vessels get very inflamed and irritated,

667
00:25:07.156 --> 00:25:09.512
cholesterol's the body's own putty,

668
00:25:09.512 --> 00:25:12.178
and their own steroids to calm the inflammation

669
00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:14.578
and smooth it down, okay?

670
00:25:14.578 --> 00:25:16.935
It's produced by the adrenal gland.

671
00:25:16.935 --> 00:25:20.476
It is our body's major protector for our nerves,

672
00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:22.930
and our brains, okay?

673
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.617
So when you take away the cholesterol,

674
00:25:25.617 --> 00:25:29.777
the inflammation goes higher, heart disease becomes worse.

675
00:25:29.777 --> 00:25:33.464
If you lower the inflammation, the C-reactive protein,

676
00:25:33.894 --> 00:25:35.516
cholesterol will just come down normally

677
00:25:35.516 --> 00:25:37.588
because it doesn't have to be that high,

678
00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:39.001
and heart disease changes around,

679
00:25:39.001 --> 00:25:41.113
and I've got a number of cases on that.

680
00:25:41.113 --> 00:25:43.758
Cholesterol is, first of all, number one,

681
00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:46.335
it's the brain's most important substance.

682
00:25:46.835 --> 00:25:50.067
I had a case recently, they called me up in Chicago,

683
00:25:50.067 --> 00:25:52.979
that he had, he goes to his doctor for his routine checkup

684
00:25:52.979 --> 00:25:55.546
at the age of 50, he's got a 229 cholesterol,

685
00:25:55.546 --> 00:25:57.424
the doctor puts him on Lipitor.

686
00:25:57.424 --> 00:25:59.989
Now I run a 280 cholesterol, okay?

687
00:25:59.989 --> 00:26:02.677
Most people that are very bright run 280 to 300.

688
00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:04.693
The brain is very, very active and doesn't sit still.

689
00:26:04.693 --> 00:26:06.448
<v Regina>Very rich in cholesterol, yes, it needs it.</v>

690
00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:08.049
<v ->Very rich in cholesterol.</v>

691
00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:10.060
Well, he comes three years later to the doctor,

692
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.928
and the guy's got now an 82 cholesterol,

693
00:26:11.928 --> 00:26:14.093
the doctor says, "That's great."

694
00:26:14.093 --> 00:26:16.835
Now he's got a fatal disease called amyloidosis.

695
00:26:16.835 --> 00:26:18.349
<v Regina>Okay, now how's that linked?</v>

696
00:26:18.349 --> 00:26:23.234
<v ->Well, type in amyloid and cholesterol into the internet.</v>

697
00:26:23.234 --> 00:26:26.001
<v Regina>A-M-Y-L-O-I-D?</v>
<v Harvey>A-M-Y</v>

698
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:27.919
<v Harvey>L-O-I-D, it's a protein,</v>

699
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:31.042
and what happens is, as the cholesterol lowers,

700
00:26:31.042 --> 00:26:35.236
amyloid increases, and the brain becomes like jelly.

701
00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:36.735
Our nerves start to deteriorate,

702
00:26:36.735 --> 00:26:39.103
they become more amyloid inflammation,

703
00:26:39.103 --> 00:26:41.121
now you look at the cholesterol,

704
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:44.587
the Lipitor advertisements, a rare and unusual side effect

705
00:26:44.587 --> 00:26:46.784
is this strange muscular pain.

706
00:26:46.784 --> 00:26:50.388
No, it's your nerves dying and the muscle's starting to rot

707
00:26:50.388 --> 00:26:52.043
because your cholesterol's too low,

708
00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:54.442
and the nerves are not feeding the tissue.

709
00:26:54.442 --> 00:26:57.962
Cholesterol, even the studies, have proven it wrong,

710
00:26:57.962 --> 00:27:01.248
but yet it's a multi-billion dollar thing,

711
00:27:01.248 --> 00:27:02.718
and everyone, they're now talking about,

712
00:27:02.718 --> 00:27:05.268
the American Academy of Pediatrics wants to put

713
00:27:05.268 --> 00:27:06.826
six year old children on it.
(Regina laughing)

714
00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:10.351
On Statins right now, on Lipitor now, okay?

715
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:12.697
They also want to put them on mood elevators

716
00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:14.318
at the age of two.

717
00:27:14.318 --> 00:27:15.555
<v Regina>This is criminal.</v>

718
00:27:15.555 --> 00:27:18.169
<v ->It's so criminal what's going on out there,</v>

719
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:21.400
and insurances will only pay for doctors to do that,

720
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.238
and everyone's gotta take their kid to a doctor

721
00:27:24.238 --> 00:27:25.644
to get all of these things done,

722
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.042
or else they're a bad parent.

723
00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:29.509
<v Regina>Well, like one of the doctors we interviewed,</v>

724
00:27:29.509 --> 00:27:33.401
they said they have about five to six calls a day

725
00:27:33.401 --> 00:27:37.144
from drug reps, and the idea is really simple.

726
00:27:37.144 --> 00:27:40.824
You get people on drugs from the cradle to the grave,

727
00:27:40.824 --> 00:27:42.562
that's the only agenda.

728
00:27:42.562 --> 00:27:44.684
However you can do it, but get 'em on from cradle to grave.

729
00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:45.600
That's sick.
<v Harvey>It's the only,</v>

730
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.658
<v Harvey>It's the only agenda.</v>

731
00:27:46.658 --> 00:27:48.951
And you know how the drug system started?

732
00:27:48.951 --> 00:27:50.072
The pharmaceutical system?

733
00:27:50.072 --> 00:27:51.992
It's a great, great story.

734
00:27:51.992 --> 00:27:54.483
In 1910, John Rockefeller gets together

735
00:27:54.483 --> 00:27:58.089
with Andrew Carnegie, where should they put their fortunes?

736
00:27:58.089 --> 00:28:01.268
They decide to put it into pharmaceutical medicine

737
00:28:01.268 --> 00:28:03.145
'cause that's the future.

738
00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:07.112
43% of the medical schools at that time are homeopathic.

739
00:28:07.112 --> 00:28:09.747
By the mid-1940's, Flower 5th Avenue New York

740
00:28:09.747 --> 00:28:11.688
loses its charter, becomes allopathic.

741
00:28:11.688 --> 00:28:13.587
So does Hahnemann Medical School in Philadelphia.

742
00:28:13.587 --> 00:28:14.269
<v Regina>Hahnemann?</v>

743
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:16.152
<v ->Hahnemann is totally now allopathic.</v>

744
00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:18.104
<v Regina>That's the famous homeopathic school.</v>

745
00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:20.502
<v ->Samuel Hahnemann's the founder of homeopathy,</v>

746
00:28:20.502 --> 00:28:22.805
is now an allopathic school.

747
00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:25.302
John Rockefeller, who started the whole ball game,

748
00:28:25.302 --> 00:28:27.958
dies at the age of 94, never taken a drug in his mouth,

749
00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:30.965
and a homeopathic physician in attendance.

750
00:28:30.965 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

751
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.525
<v ->He makes his fortune from standard oil,</v>

752
00:28:33.525 --> 00:28:35.264
and then pharmaceutical industry,

753
00:28:35.264 --> 00:28:37.204
and doesn't touch it himself.

754
00:28:37.204 --> 00:28:38.976
Does that tell you something?

755
00:28:38.976 --> 00:28:40.618
<v Regina>Yes, it speaks volumes.</v>

756
00:28:40.618 --> 00:28:43.764
<v ->Okay, and what we got right now, in medicine,</v>

757
00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:46.122
coming back to originally on Hepatitis C

758
00:28:46.122 --> 00:28:48.340
and the germ theory disease is actually picked up

759
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.602
by the system for a reason.

760
00:28:50.602 --> 00:28:53.893
In the 1880's, Pasteur comes up with a germ theory disease.

761
00:28:54.503 --> 00:28:57.069
His rival, Bechamp, says, "Germs don't cause disease,

762
00:28:57.069 --> 00:28:58.807
"they live in a diseased train."

763
00:28:58.807 --> 00:29:00.603
The germ theory's picked up because if you have

764
00:29:00.603 --> 00:29:01.670
the germ theory disease,

765
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.063
you can have the magic bullet philosophy of therapy.

766
00:29:04.063 --> 00:29:05.083
<v Regina>Right.</v>

767
00:29:05.083 --> 00:29:07.090
<v ->Now, watch every commercial.</v>

768
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.069
You have ADD, you have ED, you have PTSD--

769
00:29:11.069 --> 00:29:12.883
<v Regina>What's that, restless leg syndrome.</v>

770
00:29:12.883 --> 00:29:14.843
<v ->Rest, I have restless leg syndrome,</v>

771
00:29:14.843 --> 00:29:16.295
I have restless body syndrome,

772
00:29:16.295 --> 00:29:17.395
I have restless mind syndrome.

773
00:29:17.395 --> 00:29:18.179
(both laughing)

774
00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:18.780
But they--

775
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.599
<v Regina>Ants in your pants syndrome.</v>

776
00:29:20.599 --> 00:29:22.978
<v ->And what, erectile dysfunction came out,</v>

777
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:25.795
they started purposely changing it to initials,

778
00:29:25.795 --> 00:29:27.631
'cause you couldn't say ED anymore.

779
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:28.495
You couldn't say erectile,

780
00:29:28.495 --> 00:29:29.745
so now everything's got an initial.

781
00:29:29.745 --> 00:29:30.456
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

782
00:29:30.456 --> 00:29:31.471
<v ->And if it's got an initial,</v>

783
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:33.749
you now have the drug of choice.

784
00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:34.283
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

785
00:29:34.283 --> 00:29:36.001
<v ->And if you watch the TV,</v>

786
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:38.304
they're not allowed to use the word cure.

787
00:29:38.304 --> 00:29:40.907
They will always say this drug treats it,

788
00:29:40.907 --> 00:29:42.881
they can't use the word cure because since they've never

789
00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.464
cured a thing in 100 years, if a doctor uses the word cure,

790
00:29:45.464 --> 00:29:47.825
they will take his license away.

791
00:29:48.408 --> 00:29:51.011
I once had charges against me that I brought,

792
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:54.669
I cured a person with an illegal means.

793
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:56.473
The head of the medical board stated,

794
00:29:56.473 --> 00:29:58.447
"We do not care if your patients are getting

795
00:29:58.447 --> 00:30:00.570
"better or worse, only if you're doing the work

796
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.877
"in our way scientifically."

797
00:30:03.384 --> 00:30:06.004
Die in our hands, but don't you dare get better

798
00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.473
in a way we don't know.

799
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:09.265
<v Regina>And tell us about that, what happened?</v>

800
00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:11.986
<v ->Well, I ended up with that one, that was,</v>

801
00:30:11.986 --> 00:30:13.169
they couldn't figure out what I did.

802
00:30:13.169 --> 00:30:16.827
That was the one that they eventually censured me,

803
00:30:16.827 --> 00:30:19.994
put me on lifetime probation for illegible handwriting.

804
00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:21.455
<v Regina>For illegible handwriting.</v>

805
00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:22.529
<v ->It cost me $25,000--</v>

806
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.149
<v Regina>You and every other doctor out there</v>

807
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:26.093
should be on permanent probation then.

808
00:30:26.093 --> 00:30:27.030
<v ->That's what the judge said.</v>

809
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.052
<v Regina>But what actually happened?</v>

810
00:30:28.052 --> 00:30:29.514
What was the case?

811
00:30:30.064 --> 00:30:32.783
<v ->The case was actually a woman that comes in to me,</v>

812
00:30:32.783 --> 00:30:34.724
that had a severe eye problem,

813
00:30:34.724 --> 00:30:37.306
and I'm an opthalmologist by trade.

814
00:30:37.306 --> 00:30:38.766
This opthalmologist had been treating this guy

815
00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:41.888
for four months, this woman, for four months with no help.

816
00:30:41.888 --> 00:30:44.853
I figured out from my blood it was a kidney problem,

817
00:30:44.853 --> 00:30:46.143
in the back of the eye there was a problem,

818
00:30:46.143 --> 00:30:47.370
as to why it manifested there,

819
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.906
there was many different reasons.

820
00:30:48.906 --> 00:30:50.570
I did what's called neural therapy,

821
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.702
I injected her in back of the eye.

822
00:30:52.702 --> 00:30:57.031
Within 24 hours that eye was about 90% cleared up.

823
00:30:57.031 --> 00:30:58.471
I sent back to the opthalmologist,

824
00:30:58.471 --> 00:31:00.508
and the opthalmologist then went crazy,

825
00:31:00.508 --> 00:31:02.034
and wrote a complaint in

826
00:31:02.034 --> 00:31:04.466
that I messed around with his patient.

827
00:31:04.466 --> 00:31:07.132
Now he hadn't cured the case, but I fixed that case,

828
00:31:07.132 --> 00:31:10.290
it actually took 48 hours to completely fix that case.

829
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.270
But again--

830
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.306
<v Regina>And you paid for it.</v>

831
00:31:12.306 --> 00:31:16.368
<v ->I got censured, lifetime probation, and not only that,</v>

832
00:31:16.368 --> 00:31:19.525
because I was then put into a computer mill,

833
00:31:19.525 --> 00:31:21.606
and two states lifted my license for that.

834
00:31:21.606 --> 00:31:23.094
Two other states lifted my license

835
00:31:23.094 --> 00:31:25.429
for curing a person illegally.

836
00:31:25.429 --> 00:31:26.817
<v Regina>Yeah, isn't that amazing.</v>

837
00:31:26.817 --> 00:31:31.212
<v ->I mean, the system is do it our way, that's it,</v>

838
00:31:31.212 --> 00:31:34.411
and it's all drugs, drugs, drugs, or surgery,

839
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:36.192
and they haven't cured a thing in 100 years.

840
00:31:36.192 --> 00:31:38.091
And what's gone on now in medical school?

841
00:31:38.091 --> 00:31:40.192
If someone was on one pill, that's a lot.

842
00:31:40.192 --> 00:31:43.286
Now the average person's on four and a half medications.

843
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:45.192
I have one patient on high blood pressure

844
00:31:45.192 --> 00:31:46.578
and low blood pressure medicine,

845
00:31:46.578 --> 00:31:47.794
who's got a cardiologist.

846
00:31:47.794 --> 00:31:49.710
(Regina laughing)

847
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.996
It's all, and it's all the pharmacy salesmen.

848
00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:54.819
It just like the lobbyists.

849
00:31:54.819 --> 00:31:56.217
<v Regina>Yeah, it's the same, it's the same,</v>

850
00:31:56.217 --> 00:31:57.391
it's a very corrupt industry,

851
00:31:57.391 --> 00:31:59.439
and I think almost everybody watching this

852
00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:01.572
is well aware of the corruption that exists there.

853
00:32:01.572 --> 00:32:04.142
<v ->In fact, I wrote the only law in the United States</v>

854
00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:05.177
to break the monopoly.

855
00:32:05.177 --> 00:32:08.078
I wrote the Arizona Homeopathic Medical Practice Act.

856
00:32:08.078 --> 00:32:09.178
And the way I wrote the law,

857
00:32:09.178 --> 00:32:10.659
I did it the American way.

858
00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:12.792
I formed a political action committee,

859
00:32:12.792 --> 00:32:15.320
and I gave money to every legislator.

860
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.315
I went from the Republican fundraising party

861
00:32:17.315 --> 00:32:19.181
to the Democratic fundraising party,

862
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:22.072
there were 60 legislators, I gave them all a check.

863
00:32:22.072 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Regina>That's how you get things done around here.</v>

864
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.977
<v ->That's the American way to get things done.</v>

865
00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:29.260
I got face to face with the system, and paid them off.

866
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.618
And that's what's done with the pharmaceutical industry,

867
00:32:31.618 --> 00:32:33.260
that's what's done with the lobbyists,

868
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.095
that's what's done in Washington,

869
00:32:35.095 --> 00:32:36.300
it's the whole ball game.

870
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.992
It's all industry brainwashing, brainwashing,

871
00:32:39.992 --> 00:32:41.879
brainwashing where ever you go.

872
00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:43.533
<v Regina>At least you were wise enough, smart enough,</v>

873
00:32:43.533 --> 00:32:46.050
to play the game in the way they play it.

874
00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.031
<v ->Yeah, that's.</v>

875
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:48.892
<v Regina>Someone in here?</v>

876
00:32:48.892 --> 00:32:50.423
<v ->Yeah, someone just came back.</v>

877
00:32:50.423 --> 00:32:53.825
The real key is, though, it's the brainwashing.

878
00:32:53.825 --> 00:32:55.830
You look at, everything's cholesterol now.

879
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.773
<v Regina>Yes, I was going to ask you on that.</v>

880
00:32:57.773 --> 00:33:00.886
Okay, so you have someone who is considerably,

881
00:33:00.886 --> 00:33:03.510
say overweight, or, for whatever reason,

882
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.208
they've got genuinely clogged up arteries.

883
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:08.150
How do you avoid that to begin with?

884
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.070
Rather than some of the suggestions

885
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.243
that are being given today

886
00:33:11.243 --> 00:33:13.589
with this whole lean cuisine thing?

887
00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:16.281
<v ->Well first of all, lean cuisine, this whole ball game,</v>

888
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:16.878
recently I was--

889
00:33:16.878 --> 00:33:19.142
<v Regina>And I don't mean that, by the way, as a brand.</v>

890
00:33:19.142 --> 00:33:22.129
<v ->No, that's not Lean Cuisine brand.</v>

891
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:24.503
I like what Deepak Chopra says,

892
00:33:24.503 --> 00:33:26.604
He says, basically, if it's got a label on it,

893
00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.566
it's in a can, it's not human food.

894
00:33:28.566 --> 00:33:29.047
<v Regina>Right.</v>

895
00:33:29.047 --> 00:33:30.465
<v ->Okay, what we have in the United States,</v>

896
00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:33.559
recently I was on vacation in San Francisco,

897
00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:36.218
and because of the dollar situation,

898
00:33:36.218 --> 00:33:38.425
many, many, many European tourists.

899
00:33:38.425 --> 00:33:40.244
There were no fat people.

900
00:33:41.408 --> 00:33:42.120
It was Americans that were fat people.

901
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.633
<v Regina>They know how to cook, they eat,</v>

902
00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:44.447
healthy, fresh food.
<v Harvey>They eat</v>

903
00:33:44.447 --> 00:33:45.661
<v Harvey>fresh foods.</v>

904
00:33:45.661 --> 00:33:46.534
They eat fresh foods.

905
00:33:46.534 --> 00:33:49.059
Go into a supermarket, go into a Safeway,

906
00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:52.227
and you see this person, 300 pounds, pushing a cart,

907
00:33:52.227 --> 00:33:54.540
90% of the packaged foods.

908
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.759
Read the labels on the packaged foods.

909
00:33:56.759 --> 00:33:59.224
The Americans are the fattest people in the world.

910
00:33:59.224 --> 00:34:01.011
It's because of all the chemicals we're eating,

911
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:03.804
which is acupuncture philosophy is earth,

912
00:34:03.804 --> 00:34:06.044
so how does the body try to get rid of earth,

913
00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.515
it pipes in water and water,

914
00:34:07.515 --> 00:34:09.533
and all these people are bloated and huge

915
00:34:09.533 --> 00:34:13.917
trying to wash out the chemical crap that they've ingested.

916
00:34:13.917 --> 00:34:16.754
Europeans, they get their food fresh every day,

917
00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.439
they eat their food fresh every day.

918
00:34:18.439 --> 00:34:21.639
We go to McDonalds, we go and get packaged food,

919
00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.909
we inhale it.

920
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.643
A frozen dinner, okay?

921
00:34:24.643 --> 00:34:27.556
That's all chemicals, that's what's causing much of it.

922
00:34:27.556 --> 00:34:30.894
Americans, their diet is unbelievable.

923
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:33.198
I eat, look at my size.

924
00:34:33.198 --> 00:34:37.518
I am a double libran, I love food, watch me eat, okay?

925
00:34:37.518 --> 00:34:39.666
<v Regina>But I see you have little cans of nuts here,</v>

926
00:34:39.666 --> 00:34:41.426
and all natural things.

927
00:34:41.426 --> 00:34:44.338
<v ->I eat only, there are no chemicals in my body.</v>

928
00:34:44.338 --> 00:34:47.239
I eat fresh foods, I shop at co-ops, okay?

929
00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.583
We have farms out here,

930
00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:50.205
I grow some of my own vegetables.

931
00:34:50.205 --> 00:34:52.625
I get free range animals.

932
00:34:52.625 --> 00:34:55.922
I keep every label out of my food, and it's that simple,

933
00:34:55.922 --> 00:34:58.225
it's not hard to do, you know.

934
00:34:58.225 --> 00:35:00.263
<v Regina>And in fact I've noticed one big change,</v>

935
00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:02.438
I go back and forth to Britain fairly often

936
00:35:02.438 --> 00:35:06.063
because Scott is British, and a change that I saw,

937
00:35:06.063 --> 00:35:07.654
I had been away for several years,

938
00:35:07.654 --> 00:35:09.126
and went back a few years ago.

939
00:35:09.126 --> 00:35:11.162
The change that I saw in the population

940
00:35:11.162 --> 00:35:14.309
was just astronomical, in the obesity.

941
00:35:14.309 --> 00:35:17.007
And again, you go now, and the same American corporations

942
00:35:17.007 --> 00:35:19.866
have the same large chains of grocery stores,

943
00:35:19.866 --> 00:35:23.269
the same kind of large wholesale type suppliers,

944
00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:25.449
the shopping carts are looking like

945
00:35:25.449 --> 00:35:28.308
the American shopping carts, and the obesity followed.

946
00:35:28.308 --> 00:35:32.745
They've had huge campaigns regarding the obesity.

947
00:35:32.745 --> 00:35:34.655
Same thing in Australia now.

948
00:35:34.655 --> 00:35:37.350
So we're starting to see where ever that kind of

949
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.293
branded lifestyle goes, the obesity,

950
00:35:40.293 --> 00:35:43.398
and then morbid obesity, and the lack of health follows.

951
00:35:43.398 --> 00:35:45.541
<v ->And it's all the system's brainwashing.</v>

952
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:48.170
Lean this, no cholesterol that.

953
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.760
Leave it the way nature created it.

954
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.839
They have so interrupted nature,

955
00:35:52.839 --> 00:35:55.879
and they've so chemicalized us, and cut us apart.

956
00:35:55.879 --> 00:35:57.543
The United States, we used to be the top country

957
00:35:57.543 --> 00:35:58.301
in the world.

958
00:35:58.301 --> 00:36:01.905
We are mediocre in everything, in everything.

959
00:36:01.905 --> 00:36:03.142
And it's because of the system.

960
00:36:03.142 --> 00:36:05.820
We're creating mediocre people.

961
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.446
Our education system is now down to mediocre

962
00:36:09.446 --> 00:36:11.622
because no one can even get it anymore.

963
00:36:11.622 --> 00:36:13.905
Our minds are becoming mediocre.

964
00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:16.401
This has become in generation after generation

965
00:36:16.401 --> 00:36:19.256
we are getting weaker and weaker civilization.

966
00:36:19.256 --> 00:36:21.518
That's why we're falling apart.

967
00:36:22.328 --> 00:36:25.302
We are so controlled by the chemical industries.

968
00:36:25.302 --> 00:36:27.832
Always remember, it's the petrol chemical.

969
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.892
One leads to the other, that's it also,

970
00:36:30.892 --> 00:36:34.517
we all know what the oil conspiracies are, okay?

971
00:36:34.517 --> 00:36:37.343
No one believes that pharmaceutical system

972
00:36:37.343 --> 00:36:39.185
it is absolutely a horror.

973
00:36:39.185 --> 00:36:41.244
And now, what I've proven, which the reason I wanted

974
00:36:41.244 --> 00:36:44.073
this thing, the book will be out next year,

975
00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:46.134
all these elective surgeries.

976
00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:46.772
<v Regina>Right.</v>

977
00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:48.586
<v ->That's killing people.</v>

978
00:36:48.586 --> 00:36:52.372
Face-lifts, how barbaric can you get, okay?

979
00:36:52.372 --> 00:36:55.369
And botox, they're giving it to kids now

980
00:36:55.369 --> 00:36:57.407
to prevent wrinkles.

981
00:36:57.407 --> 00:36:59.326
It's making freaks out of human beings,

982
00:36:59.326 --> 00:37:01.391
and this is called medicine.

983
00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:04.512
This is called medicine today, okay?

984
00:37:05.102 --> 00:37:06.986
So, you know, it's one reason I had to tell you,

985
00:37:06.986 --> 00:37:08.850
this is, the turnaround of Hepatitis C.

986
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:09.830
<v Regina>Yeah, it's very interesting.</v>

987
00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.211
<v ->And I will wager my statistics with anyone else around,</v>

988
00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:16.175
and you give me any Hepatitis C case, you look at them,

989
00:37:16.175 --> 00:37:17.791
and any one that's listing with Hepatitis C,

990
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:19.644
what went on in your life six months,

991
00:37:19.644 --> 00:37:21.500
two years beforehand?

992
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.707
What trauma went on, what physical trauma?

993
00:37:23.707 --> 00:37:27.259
And I'll bet 95% come up, "Oh my God, that did it."

994
00:37:27.259 --> 00:37:29.111
<v Regina>Your phone may be jingling pretty soon.</v>

995
00:37:29.111 --> 00:37:31.797
<v ->That's one of the reasons, because Hepatitis C,</v>

996
00:37:31.797 --> 00:37:34.139
is people are lepers, okay?

997
00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:36.758
People are afraid to touch them, okay?

998
00:37:36.758 --> 00:37:38.763
Even their husbands and wives, or whatever it is,

999
00:37:38.763 --> 00:37:41.271
they're not allowed to have sex, they can't touch them.

1000
00:37:41.271 --> 00:37:42.231
They're treated that way,

1001
00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:43.339
and everyone's afraid to die.

1002
00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:45.681
No, we are changing that around.

1003
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:48.838
You change that inflammation, we are fixing those people.

1004
00:37:48.838 --> 00:37:52.545
I'll state straightforward, curing them, okay?

1005
00:37:52.545 --> 00:37:56.722
That's what, the news I wanted to get out, badly.

1006
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.489
<v ->If you're intrigued by Harvey's take</v>

1007
00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:03.088
on healing and medicine,

1008
00:38:03.088 --> 00:38:05.596
much of what he has to say is validated in our interviews

1009
00:38:05.596 --> 00:38:06.766
with Dr. Lorraine Day,

1010
00:38:06.766 --> 00:38:08.752
so you might want to check those out as well.

1011
00:38:08.752 --> 00:38:11.999
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1012
00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:18.059
(gentle music)
