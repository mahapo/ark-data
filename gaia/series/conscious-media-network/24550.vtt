00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.018
<v ->Some people call her the new Caroline Myss,</v>

2
00:00:03.018 --> 00:00:06.005
but Carol Ritberger is an original.

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.498
As happened with two of our other

4
00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:09.013
featured interviewees, it was a

5
00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:10.985
near-death-experience that allowed Carol

6
00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:14.259
to open her eyes and see life as it truly is.

7
00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.436
Unlike some in this situation, however,

8
00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.260
her eyes never closed.

9
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.553
A beautiful, abulient woman, Carol

10
00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.071
reinforces the innate beauty of humanity

11
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.128
via her ability to see the life force

12
00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:27.220
of every living thing on the planet,

13
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.968
most notably humans.

14
00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.430
Her message has many layers, but

15
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.816
one of the most important parts

16
00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:34.089
is to let us know that we must begin

17
00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.743
listening to our intuitive voice.

18
00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:41.633 line:15% 
(peaceful music)

19
00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:44.467
I think everybody wants to know,

20
00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:45.703
how does this happen?

21
00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:47.474
Everyone thinks oh my God, I would

22
00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:49.832
love to be able to see everything.

23
00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.327
But that is a blessing, but at other

24
00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:54.119
times, it can complicate life.

25
00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.964
How did this happen to you?

26
00:00:55.964 --> 00:00:57.308
<v ->Well, I died.</v>

27
00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:58.993
I actually had a near-death-experience

28
00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:01.531
that the best doctor said is that I had

29
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.387
an allergic reaction to food, but I don't

30
00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:05.105
have food allergies.

31
00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.078
And so I just went into convulsions

32
00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:09.009
and then my heart stopped, and

33
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.470
then I traveled to this beautiful

34
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.529
surreal place and learned a lot

35
00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:13.829
about life and me.

36
00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:14.939
<v woman>Can you talk about the place</v>

37
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:15.675
you went to and what you learned?

38
00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:16.913
<v ->I can.</v>

39
00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:19.782
I was raised in a very structured religion,

40
00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:22.427
and so I expected when somebody died,

41
00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:24.379
that you would have angels come,

42
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:26.576
and you'd see the white light, the tunnel.

43
00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:28.912
I was more like in a waiting room.

44
00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:30.170
Kind of like at a car wash, watching

45
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.933
everything go by, and I had three

46
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.542
light beams, that's the best way to

47
00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:37.061
describe them, balls of light come up, and

48
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:39.354
they were able to communicate without talking.

49
00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:40.815
And they taught me a lot about myself

50
00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:43.076
that I've always taken life like brain surgery,

51
00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:46.340
and too serious, and that our society is

52
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.915
too serious, so just kind of an insight to me,

53
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:54.392
and in insight to who we are, and why we're here.

54
00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:57.785
And it was a beautiful place, fun.

55
00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:59.309
The things they told me, several things,

56
00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:01.880
is they said life is like a candy store, we can

57
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.835
have anything we want, we just have to ask.

58
00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:06.338
And then the most profound thing they told

59
00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:08.707
me is it's okay to color outside the lines.

60
00:02:08.707 --> 00:02:11.213
And I had no idea what that meant.

61
00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:13.570
And then when I came back into my body,

62
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.724
my sight had been altered, to where I can

63
00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:17.933
see that glow of light around everything

64
00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:20.269
that has atoms, and molecules, and motions.

65
00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.988
Plants, animals, people.

66
00:02:22.988 --> 00:02:25.452
So and the doctor said oh not a problem,

67
00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:27.745
it will go away, it's probably from the medication

68
00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:29.815
and having to restore your heart beat back.

69
00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.447
And I said oh good, how long?

70
00:02:31.447 --> 00:02:34.998
Two weeks, well it's been 26 years.

71
00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:36.364
Not to say that medicine doesn't know

72
00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:37.942
what they're talking about, but in this case,

73
00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:39.265
it was a little bit different.

74
00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:40.385
<v woman>What a wonderful gift.</v>

75
00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:41.526
We have talked to other people

76
00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:43.371
who have had this happen after their

77
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.966
near-death-experiences, and it did go away.

78
00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.387
And so for you, it sounds like it must

79
00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:50.912
have been your dharma to have this

80
00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:52.875
near-death-experience and to be able to

81
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:56.800
now carry this knowledge and work forward.

82
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.442
<v ->Absolutely, and again I think that</v>

83
00:02:58.442 --> 00:03:00.010
the most profound thing is, the fact

84
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.983
that I always take life too seriously.

85
00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:03.690
And being a researcher and a scientist

86
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.844
by nature, I guess I had to have something

87
00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:07.327
that never goes away, so I'll remember

88
00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:08.831
what I'm supposed to do.

89
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.780
<v woman>Let's talk about the researcher</v>

90
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.284
and scientist, just for a little bit.

91
00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:12.383
About how you were conditioned

92
00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:15.006
prior to this, and well your life prior to this.

93
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:16.510
<v ->My education's in personality behavioral</v>

94
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.664
psychology, and ever since I've been

95
00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.019
a little girl, I've been wanting to know

96
00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.929
what makes people tick.

97
00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.243
And I thought how interesting we are,

98
00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:26.376
we're so different but we're so alike.

99
00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:27.432
And so that's what got me into

100
00:03:27.432 --> 00:03:29.448
the field of personality.

101
00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:31.475
And so I started looking at the parts

102
00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:33.651
of us that are so predictable,

103
00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:35.400
our neurology, how do we gather

104
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.128
information, make decisions, and

105
00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:38.770
that never seems to change, no matter

106
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.786
how much conditioning we have.

107
00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:42.471
So that's really the foundation,

108
00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:43.815
and prior to the near death, I was

109
00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:45.554
doing corporate training, and corporate

110
00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:47.324
work shops, and talk about an absolute

111
00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:50.492
opposite, oh my gosh, an adjustment.

112
00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:51.943
Then I go to my corporate training

113
00:03:51.943 --> 00:03:53.180
and I'm thinking oh my gosh, I hope

114
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.321
nobody in here can notice that I can

115
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:56.433
see what's going on in colors.

116
00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:58.236
It was very interesting.

117
00:03:58.236 --> 00:03:59.740
Kind of a one foot in one world,

118
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.894
and one foot in the other world.

119
00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:03.077
<v woman>Just to digress into your</v>

120
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:04.742
near-death-experience one moment,

121
00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:05.915
when you were shown about how you

122
00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:07.601
take things too seriously, and our culture

123
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.254
does, can you expand on that just a little

124
00:04:09.254 --> 00:04:12.358
bit more, of what you were shown, that moment.

125
00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:13.776
<v ->Well I can.</v>

126
00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:15.504
The thing that we forget, is that we're all

127
00:04:15.504 --> 00:04:18.394
intuitive, we all have this extra ability

128
00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:21.765
to be able to kinda see the world differently.

129
00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:23.983
And that intuition gives us a lot of possibilities,

130
00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:26.554
and is part of the creation of ideas

131
00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:28.303
and alternative solutions.

132
00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:30.948
But in our conditioning we lose that,

133
00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:33.242
and we start losing it very early on,

134
00:04:33.242 --> 00:04:35.556
about three years old, and we try to

135
00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:37.753
fit in this world that covets only logical

136
00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:41.028
linear thinking, and we forsake that part of us.

137
00:04:41.028 --> 00:04:43.865
And as a result we miss a part of the specialness

138
00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.062
of who we are, and that was one of the

139
00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:48.014
things that they shared, is that there's

140
00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:49.539
going to come a time that we are going

141
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.726
to survive on our intuition more so

142
00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:54.936
than our logic, in the very near future.

143
00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:57.112
<v woman>I keep getting the same thing,</v>

144
00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:59.021
and it seems like we really need to start

145
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.818
looking at this whole area of our own beings

146
00:05:02.818 --> 00:05:06.145
as a top priority in development, really.

147
00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:08.098
<v ->Absolutely, and a lot of people say well</v>

148
00:05:08.098 --> 00:05:10.509
gosh we're really regressing, we're going

149
00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.567
back to the hunter/gatherer part of us,

150
00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:14.818
where we relied on our intuition in order

151
00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:17.516
to survive, but it's much more than that

152
00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:20.097
because now we have the ability to really

153
00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:22.476
integrate both into our thinking, which is

154
00:05:22.476 --> 00:05:24.022
the best of both worlds.

155
00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:25.910
You can deal with what's obvious, but you

156
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.491
can also learn how to tap into the wisdom

157
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:30.785
that we hold inside, that's type of intuition.

158
00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:32.449
And if you combine those two, I mean the

159
00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.435
whole world expands, as does your thinking.

160
00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.619
<v woman>Absolutely.</v>

161
00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.243
So you got out of the hospital, obviously,

162
00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:42.325
after your food poisoning, so to speak.

163
00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.885
And you were able to see, what was your

164
00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:47.605
life like in those immediate days following?

165
00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:49.290
<v ->It was terrible, it was terrible.</v>

166
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.445
<v woman>I know Mel Gibson in the movie</v>

167
00:05:51.445 --> 00:05:54.111
What Women Want, oh I don't need to hear that.

168
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:55.103
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>

169
00:05:55.103 --> 00:05:56.244
<v woman>So how was it?</v>

170
00:05:56.244 --> 00:05:58.719
<v ->Well here I am, I mean this occurred in January</v>

171
00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.631
and living in this area that's foggy,

172
00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:03.369
and damp, and cold, and you couldn't

173
00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:04.937
even see across the street because of the fog.

174
00:06:04.937 --> 00:06:07.764
And I'm wearing sunglasses, and trying

175
00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:09.758
to figure out what this light is, because

176
00:06:09.758 --> 00:06:11.379
my sight had been altered to where I'm

177
00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.875
always just letting in too much light.

178
00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:15.241
And for me it was like the brightest

179
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.395
sunny day, and here I am in sunglasses,

180
00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:18.696
and people are going oh my gosh,

181
00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:20.606
what's wrong with this lady?

182
00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:24.567
But I really had hoped that it would go away.

183
00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:28.690
And I just kind of everyday that was my mantra.

184
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.173
Okay I'm gonna wake up today, and it's

185
00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:32.935
not gonna be there, and I didn't know what it was.

186
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:35.613
I had never studied any of the metaphysical

187
00:06:35.613 --> 00:06:38.706
sciences at all, and I'm walking around

188
00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:41.329
trying to explain to my family, gee

189
00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:42.993
there's a glow of light around you,

190
00:06:42.993 --> 00:06:44.593
and it's changing all the time, and they're

191
00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:48.497
going oh my gosh, so it was really a tumultuous

192
00:06:48.497 --> 00:06:52.806
time, and a time of a lot of fear truthfully.

193
00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:54.107
What is it?

194
00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:55.569
Will it go away?

195
00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.171
And will I get back to what I considered normal?

196
00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:02.016
How do I do it?

197
00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:02.874
What if it doesn't?

198
00:07:02.874 --> 00:07:03.973
That was my biggest thing, what if it doesn't?

199
00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:05.125
And I'd wake up in the morning, okay,

200
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.917
it's still there, so.

201
00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:08.282
<v woman>Well when did you start</v>

202
00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:11.492
actually seeing definable things in a person,

203
00:07:11.492 --> 00:07:13.402
so you realize you're able to tell if someone

204
00:07:13.402 --> 00:07:17.241
was off balance, becoming ill, or what not?

205
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.066
<v ->That really didn't happen until about</v>

206
00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:20.911
four or five years into it.

207
00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:23.940
The aura is exquisite, meaning that it's just

208
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.404
dancing color, and every time a person

209
00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.719
thinks it's like a new color and a sunburst

210
00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.542
that just comes off of them.

211
00:07:30.542 --> 00:07:32.132
So for the first few years, I was just

212
00:07:32.132 --> 00:07:34.307
fascinated to learn what it was, and

213
00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:37.187
why did it change, and did food have

214
00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:38.585
anything to do with it, and thought,

215
00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:41.006
and personality, so it was a real kind of

216
00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:44.035
curious, inquisitive time for me.

217
00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:44.952
<v woman>What were some of your</v>

218
00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:46.062
very early discoveries, just watching

219
00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:48.728
different types of people?

220
00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:50.776
<v ->Probably the most profound part</v>

221
00:07:50.776 --> 00:07:54.093
of it was that I could notice that when

222
00:07:54.093 --> 00:07:57.175
people appeared to me to being stressed,

223
00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:59.276
understanding personalities, pretty easy to read,

224
00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:02.689
that their aura would change so significantly.

225
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:05.730
It would pull close to their body and if someone

226
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.745
was under prolonged stress and you talked

227
00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:10.103
to them, then their aura would actually

228
00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:12.215
develop like holes in it.

229
00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:14.241
So that was really my first connection

230
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:17.270
with trying to understand what really

231
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.865
impacts who we are in this aura,

232
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.711
and so I started making the connection

233
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.321
more with stress than anything.

234
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:24.782
And then when somebody would laugh,

235
00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:26.158
the aura would get fluffy, and it would

236
00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:28.132
just kind of reach out, and it's like hello

237
00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:31.853
I'm here and so it was just about four years

238
00:08:31.853 --> 00:08:34.936
of intense learning and observation.

239
00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:35.928
<v woman>Let's take that thread.</v>

240
00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:37.336
So you started noticing when there

241
00:08:37.336 --> 00:08:38.840
was a lot of stress, for example,

242
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.568
then you have holes in the aura.

243
00:08:40.568 --> 00:08:41.827
And as your knowledge became more

244
00:08:41.827 --> 00:08:44.141
sophisticated, what did you start

245
00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:46.370
learning that to mean?

246
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.919
<v ->Well I took it from just watching</v>

247
00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:51.213
the aura and how people deal with

248
00:08:51.213 --> 00:08:52.941
situations and stress, and then I

249
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:54.402
overlaid that with my education

250
00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:56.898
with personality, and one of the things

251
00:08:56.898 --> 00:08:58.242
I learned with personality and the

252
00:08:58.242 --> 00:08:59.660
neurology, the way that I work with

253
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.431
it is, that any time you step outside

254
00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:04.151
of your hard wiring in your brain,

255
00:09:04.151 --> 00:09:05.719
you're gonna have stress.

256
00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:07.020
And what causes that, and how does

257
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.886
it affect you, and how does it change

258
00:09:08.886 --> 00:09:10.230
the chemistry of the body?

259
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.139
So that kind of is where it went.

260
00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:13.974
And then I started studying the body,

261
00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:16.150
physiology, anatomy, and connecting

262
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.934
the holes or the protrusions, or the

263
00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:20.704
hot spots I call them, where there's

264
00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:22.282
a tremendous amount of maybe a

265
00:09:22.282 --> 00:09:24.981
red hot spot, or then also why would I

266
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.688
see patterns, and colors, and start

267
00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:28.842
connecting that with diabetes and

268
00:09:28.842 --> 00:09:31.125
cancer, and just kind of putting together

269
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:35.146
my own I don't know probably pre-med

270
00:09:35.146 --> 00:09:37.749
book, if you can call it that.

271
00:09:37.749 --> 00:09:39.978
<v woman>Okay we are both laughing</v>

272
00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:41.930
because the question I'm about to ask

273
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.425
you, I have already asked you three times.

274
00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:46.377
And every time I ask this question,

275
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.385
something, some major noise comes along.

276
00:09:49.385 --> 00:09:50.665
Someone comes in the room, the vacuum

277
00:09:50.665 --> 00:09:53.449
cleaner starts, a baby cries.

278
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:55.315
So we'll talk about why in a minute.

279
00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.107
But let me ask the question one more time.

280
00:09:57.107 --> 00:09:57.982
<v ->Right.</v>

281
00:09:57.982 --> 00:09:58.953
(laughing)

282
00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:00.009
<v woman>And that is, getting to</v>

283
00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:02.387
the bone of things, our emotions,

284
00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:04.627
our emotional field, and the magnitude

285
00:10:04.627 --> 00:10:07.283
of the importance of our emotions

286
00:10:07.283 --> 00:10:09.767
in our evolution, as a species, and also

287
00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:12.157
in our own personal evolution, and

288
00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.397
where we find ourselves right now.

289
00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:16.199
And I know you have a lot to say about it.

290
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.941
And this time, the fourth time's a charm.

291
00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:20.242
<v ->Well I think we finally got to where</v>

292
00:10:20.242 --> 00:10:21.724
we were supposed to, because the first

293
00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:23.090
time you asked me, we were kind of

294
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.482
in that logical part of it, that pragmatic

295
00:10:26.482 --> 00:10:28.295
scientific part of it, and then we went

296
00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:29.671
to the next one, and we kind of filtered

297
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.902
through, and down to where we should be.

298
00:10:32.902 --> 00:10:35.100
There are really only two kinds of emotions.

299
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.401
There's fear and love.

300
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:38.406
And when we really look at who we are,

301
00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:41.051
as this soul, this energetic being,

302
00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:43.078
we are really pure love.

303
00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:44.912
But in our conditioning, we are conditioned

304
00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.941
in fear, we are never born in fear.

305
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:49.871
And it's just something that's gifted

306
00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:53.072
from our interaction with other people,

307
00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:54.704
and their opinions, and well it may be

308
00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:57.530
that the opinions are a value.

309
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.257
They really do condition us to

310
00:10:59.257 --> 00:11:02.586
be in fear, fear of survival, fear of unknown,

311
00:11:02.586 --> 00:11:04.740
fear of abandonment, fear of betrayal.

312
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.628
All the ones that the primary fears

313
00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:08.655
that we have that run our life.

314
00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:11.641
But emotions from the soul's perspective

315
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:13.977
are how we gauge whether we're

316
00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:16.484
in alignment with our purpose,

317
00:11:16.484 --> 00:11:18.862
our soul work, or we're out of alignment.

318
00:11:18.862 --> 00:11:20.099
And when I even say that, we're never

319
00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:22.681
really out of alignment, it's just kind of

320
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.429
the metaphor I use is we're going

321
00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:26.350
from California to New York.

322
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.715
And every so often we just kind of

323
00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:29.582
decide we want to go see the Grand Canyon,

324
00:11:29.582 --> 00:11:32.269
and we see that as a detour, and our emotions

325
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:33.869
let us know that the thought that we're

326
00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:37.304
engaging in, the story, the repetition,

327
00:11:37.304 --> 00:11:39.501
isn't in our best interest.

328
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:41.389
So our emotions really are very important.

329
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:43.810
And emotions are energy.

330
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.370
So when we feel anger or hatred,

331
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.879
that is leaving us in great waves,

332
00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:51.266
and it's reaching out there and saying

333
00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:52.599
to anybody else, is there anybody else

334
00:11:52.599 --> 00:11:55.265
out there that's angry, and then it dances

335
00:11:55.265 --> 00:11:57.335
and intermingles, and it becomes more,

336
00:11:57.335 --> 00:11:58.678
and is there anybody else?

337
00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:01.420
And as a result, then we find that

338
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.203
it's very difficult for us to be able

339
00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:06.240
to shift our thinking, and it needs

340
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.811
to come back to looking at our emotions.

341
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.464
The stronger the emotion, the further

342
00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:13.387
we are away from ourselves.

343
00:12:13.387 --> 00:12:16.128
The closer to love, and most importantly

344
00:12:16.128 --> 00:12:18.592
self love, then we're back in our own body,

345
00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:20.704
back in our own life, doing our own work.

346
00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:22.485
Speaking our truth.

347
00:12:22.485 --> 00:12:24.543
<v woman>You have watched the auras</v>

348
00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:26.719
of people change, you're watching us

349
00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:29.716
evolve as a species, you're watching

350
00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:32.894
the role that emotion is playing in this.

351
00:12:32.894 --> 00:12:34.879
Can you talk about that for a bit?

352
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:35.796
<v ->Oh I can.</v>

353
00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:38.452
I think that with being a medical intuitive,

354
00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:41.140
a lot of my focus has been on the effects

355
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.267
of emotions and thoughts in the physical body,

356
00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:48.798
and how it causes a pre-illness in the field.

357
00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:51.037
But I think that this is a lot more than

358
00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:53.448
just our own body, and our own survival.

359
00:12:53.448 --> 00:12:56.359
I think it's the survival of our entire species.

360
00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.290
And I think we're getting closer to realizing

361
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.499
if we really want to heal ourselves,

362
00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:02.632
instead of just curing, meaning putting

363
00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:04.200
band-aids on a boo-boo, we really gotta

364
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.402
go inside and the old mantra, know thyself,

365
00:13:08.402 --> 00:13:10.578
is really important.

366
00:13:10.578 --> 00:13:13.276
And I think emotions let us know our self and

367
00:13:13.276 --> 00:13:17.074
who we are, and we need to start expressing them.

368
00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:19.484
The indigos are a perfect expression of that.

369
00:13:19.484 --> 00:13:21.041
Everything about them is truth.

370
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:23.302
Whether we like it or not, it's truth.

371
00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.233
<v woman>Let's talk about them.</v>

372
00:13:25.233 --> 00:13:27.366
Because you have dealt with some.

373
00:13:27.366 --> 00:13:28.987
You have had the pleasure of dealing

374
00:13:28.987 --> 00:13:31.526
with some of the indigo kids.

375
00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:34.107
And first of all, let's have your definition of

376
00:13:34.107 --> 00:13:38.086
what the indigo children are, in the broadest sense.

377
00:13:38.086 --> 00:13:41.627
<v ->The broadest sense scientifically if I can</v>

378
00:13:41.627 --> 00:13:44.229
kind of combined the two, which sounds

379
00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:45.914
a little strange when I talk to scientists

380
00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:48.964
about it, indigo refers to the sixth chakra.

381
00:13:48.964 --> 00:13:51.546
Kind of the windows of the soul,

382
00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:52.986
that intuitive part of us that we

383
00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:55.268
associate with the pre-frontal lobes.

384
00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:57.198
So that's why they're called indigos,

385
00:13:57.198 --> 00:13:58.980
is just because that particular part

386
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.679
of our body actually resonates the

387
00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:04.143
vibration in color when you add the

388
00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.011
color and light to it, it becomes indigo.

389
00:14:07.011 --> 00:14:08.078
These children were written about

390
00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:10.809
a long time ago, in a lot of the ancient texts,

391
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:13.369
and they were called blue children.

392
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:16.088
And blue is the color of truth,

393
00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:19.171
and these children are truth.

394
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:21.453
And again we as parents or grandparents

395
00:14:21.453 --> 00:14:23.971
may not necessarily like what they

396
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:26.637
have to say, but they do speak their truth,

397
00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:28.237
and they do remind us when we're not

398
00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:30.573
speaking ours.

399
00:14:30.573 --> 00:14:32.887
And that old cliche it's better to be seen

400
00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:34.316
and not heard, doesn't work for these

401
00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:35.981
children at all.

402
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:37.058
<v woman>Give us some examples of</v>

403
00:14:37.058 --> 00:14:38.903
some of the kids you've met and some

404
00:14:38.903 --> 00:14:40.492
of what you've learned from them,

405
00:14:40.492 --> 00:14:42.434
and some of what their parents and

406
00:14:42.434 --> 00:14:44.428
others have learned from them as well.

407
00:14:44.428 --> 00:14:46.156
And how you identify someone that you

408
00:14:46.156 --> 00:14:48.961
would say is an indigo child.

409
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:50.540
<v ->Well we can use the cliche these</v>

410
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.332
children have more energy, which

411
00:14:52.332 --> 00:14:53.878
all children have energy, but they

412
00:14:53.878 --> 00:14:56.054
literally do, their field is much more

413
00:14:56.054 --> 00:14:58.390
dynamic meaning that it doesn't

414
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.768
seem to have this constrain that

415
00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:03.563
we in our logic and mature whatever

416
00:15:03.563 --> 00:15:05.557
that means, puts on ourselves, that

417
00:15:05.557 --> 00:15:08.139
limitation either in thinking or in our

418
00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:09.930
activities, or in aura.

419
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.298
They're very expansive.

420
00:15:12.298 --> 00:15:15.029
They interact with everything in a very

421
00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:18.399
pure way, there's few limitations in their

422
00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.076
thinking, they believe they can do anything.

423
00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:24.170
I had a mother bring a young girl in to me.

424
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.764
And she came in, and she walked into my

425
00:15:27.764 --> 00:15:30.141
office, and she just started looking around

426
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.265
and just observing, this is another quality

427
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.900
about the children is they're great observers.

428
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.585
And when they look at you, they look into

429
00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:38.153
your soul, they look into your eyes and

430
00:15:38.153 --> 00:15:41.054
you know they are sizing you up.

431
00:15:41.054 --> 00:15:43.966
Is she who she says she is, does she.

432
00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:45.854
And again not with judgement, it's just

433
00:15:45.854 --> 00:15:47.763
the way that they connect with us.

434
00:15:47.763 --> 00:15:49.107
And she walked into my office and

435
00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:50.813
she was looking around, and she

436
00:15:50.813 --> 00:15:52.658
just very seriously sat down because

437
00:15:52.658 --> 00:15:54.952
I color, and I thought oh my gosh

438
00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:56.701
is there a cosmic sense of humor.

439
00:15:56.701 --> 00:15:58.226
Here I am at this age walking around

440
00:15:58.226 --> 00:16:00.157
with my crayon box.

441
00:16:00.157 --> 00:16:01.521
But she sat down very seriously

442
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:03.858
and she said to me, "you like angels."

443
00:16:03.858 --> 00:16:06.919
And I said I do, and she said "so do I."

444
00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:09.031
And she said, "and I touch them.

445
00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:11.025
I touch these baby angles all the time."

446
00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:12.871
And she moved her hand, and she went

447
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.452
"touch it like this", and she would open it up.

448
00:16:15.452 --> 00:16:17.713
And I watched her mother's aura just

449
00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:21.062
pull in and cringe, and the child was

450
00:16:21.062 --> 00:16:22.886
so sensitive to that.

451
00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:24.656
So I said well let's color.

452
00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:26.118
And I said do you know why you're here?

453
00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.355
And she said, "well my mom wants you

454
00:16:27.355 --> 00:16:30.139
to color me, and to explain why I'm

455
00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:32.923
having some of these seizures that I'm having.

456
00:16:32.923 --> 00:16:34.352
And why I'm having some of this

457
00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:37.392
behavior that appears to be like autistic.

458
00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:40.442
This repetitive pattern of expression.

459
00:16:40.442 --> 00:16:43.407
This touching, releasing, touching."

460
00:16:43.407 --> 00:16:45.892
And so we colored.

461
00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:49.284
And she said, "that pattern is that I

462
00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:51.918
touch the angels, the baby angels.

463
00:16:51.918 --> 00:16:53.551
They want to come forward."

464
00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:54.649
And she says, "I put my hand out

465
00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.102
and I allow them to do that."

466
00:16:57.102 --> 00:16:58.340
And she looked at me and she said,

467
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.804
"and you believe me."

468
00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:02.382
And I said, I do, because I know

469
00:17:02.382 --> 00:17:04.089
that they're real, she said, "can you see them?"

470
00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.315
I said no.

471
00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:07.139
She said, "would you like me to color one?"

472
00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:08.963
And you would think this child was a

473
00:17:08.963 --> 00:17:11.160
Michelangelo with this angel that was

474
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.616
just exquisite, and but it wasn't kind of

475
00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:17.645
the angels that maybe you or I would think.

476
00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:19.896
They were free, they were fun, they were

477
00:17:19.896 --> 00:17:23.490
sloppy in their appearance, the halos weren't

478
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.178
there, the wings were and so forth.

479
00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:28.108
But it was just beautiful.

480
00:17:28.108 --> 00:17:30.199
And I talked to her about the seizures,

481
00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:31.799
and I asked her about them, and she said,

482
00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:34.487
I asked her if they make her afraid.

483
00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:36.268
And she said, "oh no."

484
00:17:36.268 --> 00:17:39.254
She says, "because in them, I get to talk to God.

485
00:17:39.254 --> 00:17:41.697
I get to talk to this place that I get

486
00:17:41.697 --> 00:17:43.724
to go home to."

487
00:17:43.724 --> 00:17:47.041
And she said, "but it scares my mom."

488
00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:50.144
And I looked at her mom and she said,

489
00:17:50.144 --> 00:17:53.622
"but you know when you're alive", she says,

490
00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:56.534
"you don't get a chance to do this, Carol.

491
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.881
And mom doesn't get a chance, but I get

492
00:17:58.881 --> 00:18:00.480
to do this."

493
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.144
And she says, and she kind of sat there

494
00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:04.277
and she set herself and she goes,

495
00:18:04.277 --> 00:18:07.551
"but I wouldn't want you to have

496
00:18:07.551 --> 00:18:09.951
seizures in order to do that."

497
00:18:09.951 --> 00:18:13.414
And she said, "you died once."

498
00:18:13.414 --> 00:18:16.196
And she said, "and you don't need to die again.

499
00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:20.340
All you need to do is to just go in the quietness."

500
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.452
And then she asked her mother,

501
00:18:22.452 --> 00:18:24.478
"would you like me to stop touching the angels

502
00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:26.515
because it concerns you so much?

503
00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:28.947
If you would, I will stop."

504
00:18:28.947 --> 00:18:29.907
Well of course the mother and I are

505
00:18:29.907 --> 00:18:31.934
blubbering all over everywhere.

506
00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:35.902
Oh my God, the truth and purity of this child.

507
00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:38.280
And that's what they do, they transform you.

508
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.378
<v woman>How old was that little girl?</v>

509
00:18:39.378 --> 00:18:40.819
<v ->She was four years old at the time.</v>

510
00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.077
<v woman>Oh my, four.</v>

511
00:18:42.077 --> 00:18:46.188
And now are the indigo children

512
00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:50.528
do they often show themselves as

513
00:18:50.528 --> 00:18:53.472
what is known as autistic, or is

514
00:18:53.472 --> 00:18:54.922
that just some of the time?

515
00:18:54.922 --> 00:18:56.425
<v ->That's just some of the time.</v>

516
00:18:56.425 --> 00:18:58.985
And again, we do have more autism

517
00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:02.474
in our society than we have ever had.

518
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:06.111
And for some of us who kind of look

519
00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.404
at the world through the eyes of energy,

520
00:19:08.404 --> 00:19:10.825
and look through the eyes of where we

521
00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:14.505
evolve to, some of us believe that maybe

522
00:19:14.505 --> 00:19:16.755
through autism, we're learning that we

523
00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:19.113
don't have to speak everything.

524
00:19:19.113 --> 00:19:20.841
Maybe we just have to feel.

525
00:19:20.841 --> 00:19:24.947
Maybe we have to engage in the purity of what is.

526
00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.109
<v woman>Interesting.</v>

527
00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:27.571
We interviewed Ron Davis of the Davis

528
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:31.368
Dyslexia Institute, and Ron is autistic.

529
00:19:31.368 --> 00:19:33.320
He didn't speak until he was 17.

530
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.423
By 19, the military industrial complex

531
00:19:36.423 --> 00:19:38.663
was using his brain to detect flaws

532
00:19:38.663 --> 00:19:40.893
in the Polaris missile system.

533
00:19:40.893 --> 00:19:43.719
And he described to us what it was like.

534
00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:46.588
as an autistic person, one foot in one world,

535
00:19:46.588 --> 00:19:47.922
one foot in the other, and he said,

536
00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:49.873
"I can feel myself in three dimensions.

537
00:19:49.873 --> 00:19:52.583
I'm aware of being in three dimensions at once."

538
00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:54.854
And he said, as an autistic baby, they don't

539
00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:57.841
crawl forward to explore, because they've

540
00:19:57.841 --> 00:19:59.345
already been there and back.

541
00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:00.773
<v ->Exactly.</v>

542
00:20:00.773 --> 00:20:01.787
<v woman>Now have you heard these</v>

543
00:20:01.787 --> 00:20:02.662
same kinds of stories?

544
00:20:02.662 --> 00:20:03.675
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

545
00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:07.536
And again, I think that part of their

546
00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:12.187
gift to us is to cause us to think.

547
00:20:12.187 --> 00:20:14.501
And to cause us to evaluate our life,

548
00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:17.456
and to be aware when we compromise

549
00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:19.792
our self, and be aware when we suppress

550
00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:23.204
an emotion, that really needs to be spoken.

551
00:20:23.204 --> 00:20:25.935
And again, we're so concerned and our

552
00:20:25.935 --> 00:20:28.878
conditioning is that we don't say anything

553
00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:31.736
to hurt someone's feelings, or we just

554
00:20:31.736 --> 00:20:34.383
kind of sit quietly and we suffer in silence

555
00:20:34.383 --> 00:20:35.865
and so forth.

556
00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:37.572
And I can tell you as a medical intuitive,

557
00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:40.110
that many of the illnesses we have

558
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.830
that are chronic in nature, is the chronic

559
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.531
nature that we don't express our emotions.

560
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:48.195
And it will surface in different places,

561
00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:50.083
different ways, and the indigos been

562
00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.344
around for a long time, this is something

563
00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:53.751
that we're hearing that we're getting

564
00:20:53.751 --> 00:20:55.821
more of them, that's true.

565
00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.571
We know that scientifically there are more

566
00:20:57.571 --> 00:21:01.634
being born, but by the same token,

567
00:21:01.634 --> 00:21:04.439
we also know that there have been

568
00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:06.199
indigos born for a long time.

569
00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:07.852
Those are the people who have always

570
00:21:07.852 --> 00:21:09.334
been the different thinkers, and march

571
00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:11.244
to their own drummers, and been willing

572
00:21:11.244 --> 00:21:14.939
to do it long before the new children came along.

573
00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:18.007
<v woman>So with the new children,</v>

574
00:21:18.007 --> 00:21:20.684
obviously is coming a new age.

575
00:21:20.684 --> 00:21:22.945
And you must be seeing differences

576
00:21:22.945 --> 00:21:27.776
in the aura, even now, from 20 years plus

577
00:21:27.776 --> 00:21:30.666
when you began all of this, that there

578
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:32.288
are two different tracks I want to take here.

579
00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:35.254
So I think they can merge.

580
00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:37.227
One has to do, I want to know how you're

581
00:21:37.227 --> 00:21:39.520
perceiving these changes within the aura

582
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.589
and what we are becoming, and this

583
00:21:41.589 --> 00:21:44.661
whole notion of transparency IE truth.

584
00:21:44.661 --> 00:21:45.738
<v ->Okay.</v>

585
00:21:45.738 --> 00:21:46.911
<v woman>So take off on either one</v>

586
00:21:46.911 --> 00:21:48.138
and then we'll pick it up.

587
00:21:48.138 --> 00:21:50.773
<v ->Okay well from the aura standpoint</v>

588
00:21:50.773 --> 00:21:53.642
their mental area of their body,

589
00:21:53.642 --> 00:21:55.284
their head, their shoulders, that halo

590
00:21:55.284 --> 00:21:57.769
around them, is much more active.

591
00:21:57.769 --> 00:22:00.383
And part of the reason is that we

592
00:22:00.383 --> 00:22:01.865
actually have chakras around the

593
00:22:01.865 --> 00:22:04.404
crowns of our head, that's tied to our soul.

594
00:22:04.404 --> 00:22:06.110
So instead of just the seven in the body

595
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.795
that we talk about, we have five that are

596
00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:11.006
really the expression of the soul part of who we are.

597
00:22:11.006 --> 00:22:14.952
And with these children, their mental acuity,

598
00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:18.035
their level of comprehension, their ability

599
00:22:18.035 --> 00:22:22.344
to multi-task, their ability to we kind of call it

600
00:22:22.344 --> 00:22:25.640
sometimes label it with ADD, from the

601
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.282
standpoint that they don't appear to be

602
00:22:27.282 --> 00:22:29.031
as focused as we would like.

603
00:22:29.031 --> 00:22:31.026
But these children can actually be

604
00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:32.647
doing something with their hands,

605
00:22:32.647 --> 00:22:34.535
hearing everything that's being said,

606
00:22:34.535 --> 00:22:36.914
and being visually engaged in something.

607
00:22:36.914 --> 00:22:38.300
And somebody will say, oh well you're not

608
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.041
paying attention, they say oh no they are.

609
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:43.195
So neurologically there's some major changes

610
00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:45.755
in the structure of the brain itself.

611
00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:47.868
And there's some other changes in the

612
00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:51.099
anatomy of the body, their liver's different.

613
00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:54.993
It actually is denser in its matter.

614
00:22:54.993 --> 00:22:57.274
It's able to deal with the environmental

615
00:22:57.274 --> 00:23:00.485
contaminants, it doesn't seem to be

616
00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:04.848
as prone to a lot of the lack of cleansing,

617
00:23:04.848 --> 00:23:09.317
or the harboring of the yeast, and the fungus

618
00:23:09.317 --> 00:23:12.037
and all the things that we have, the bacteria.

619
00:23:12.037 --> 00:23:16.410
And then also their spleens are more able to

620
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:20.090
transmute a lot of the autoimmune disorders

621
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.823
we have, for example there's a wonderful

622
00:23:23.823 --> 00:23:26.180
study out of UCLA where a child was able

623
00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.124
to literally transmute AIDS out of his body,

624
00:23:29.124 --> 00:23:31.342
between birth and five.

625
00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:34.915
But they fall victim to a common cold.

626
00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:37.006
And so I always say that they're

627
00:23:37.006 --> 00:23:39.854
the new improved model of a new vehicle.

628
00:23:39.854 --> 00:23:43.351
They still have a few bugs, per se, but that's

629
00:23:43.351 --> 00:23:45.624
changing as more children are being born.

630
00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:47.905
We're really on the brink of a whole new

631
00:23:47.905 --> 00:23:51.544
evolution of both consciousness and our species.

632
00:23:51.544 --> 00:23:53.144
<v woman>Absolutely.</v>

633
00:23:53.144 --> 00:23:56.375
How are you seeing this extend itself into us?

634
00:23:56.375 --> 00:23:59.404
I mean we all chose to incarnate at this time,

635
00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:02.124
while the earth and the cosmos is going

636
00:24:02.124 --> 00:24:04.908
through all these changes, whether you want

637
00:24:04.908 --> 00:24:07.126
to look at it through the lens of the Mayan calendar.

638
00:24:07.126 --> 00:24:09.640
It doesn't really matter, i think everybody

639
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.874
every sentient thing knows things are changing

640
00:24:11.874 --> 00:24:12.930
around here.

641
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.900
<v ->Oh absolutely.</v>

642
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.839
<v woman>How are you seeing it</v>

643
00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:16.770
express itself in our auras as adults,

644
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.391
who have chosen to make this transition

645
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:21.825
across time, space, and energy fields?

646
00:24:21.825 --> 00:24:23.777
<v ->Well I think for the first thing</v>

647
00:24:23.777 --> 00:24:26.464
to answer that question is I think

648
00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:28.651
we've really come and kind of greased

649
00:24:28.651 --> 00:24:31.183
the skids for these kids.

650
00:24:31.183 --> 00:24:33.515
That we are really that generation

651
00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.915
of shape shifting, and the consciousness,

652
00:24:35.915 --> 00:24:37.600
in the way that we look at the world,

653
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.637
and the way that we value earth,

654
00:24:39.637 --> 00:24:42.219
and the way that we live our life.

655
00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:44.426
So I think that there's a major gift

656
00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:46.986
that we've brought to these children.

657
00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:48.800
Working with the children, I find that

658
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.793
they're a little bit frustrated because

659
00:24:50.793 --> 00:24:52.255
they really thought this was going to be

660
00:24:52.255 --> 00:24:56.187
probably more evolved than it really is.

661
00:24:56.187 --> 00:25:00.611
But again, I think that that's a learning in itself.

662
00:25:01.544 --> 00:25:05.886
But for us, it's to really get to know ourselves.

663
00:25:07.066 --> 00:25:09.630
It's to be truthful with ourselves,

664
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.549
even if we're not truthful with other people,

665
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:13.214
at least be truthful with ourselves.

666
00:25:13.214 --> 00:25:14.312
<v woman>My dad has said that since</v>

667
00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:16.467
I was a little child, that was his mantra.

668
00:25:16.467 --> 00:25:18.472
<v ->And to look in the mirror and to see the beauty.</v>

669
00:25:18.472 --> 00:25:20.158
I always say to people, if you could

670
00:25:20.158 --> 00:25:22.376
see yourself through my eyes, there's

671
00:25:22.376 --> 00:25:25.276
only magnificence, meaning there's no

672
00:25:25.276 --> 00:25:28.168
imperfections, you're never stuck,

673
00:25:28.168 --> 00:25:30.343
you're only stuck in your thinking.

674
00:25:30.343 --> 00:25:32.551
But we aren't truthful with ourselves.

675
00:25:32.551 --> 00:25:34.098
We don't look in the mirror and go,

676
00:25:34.098 --> 00:25:35.783
wow that's a nice smile, Carol.

677
00:25:35.783 --> 00:25:37.799
Or look at the sparkle in the eye.

678
00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:39.079
Because then it's like oh my gosh

679
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:42.086
that's from the ego, and as a result,

680
00:25:42.086 --> 00:25:44.988
we don't praise ourselves or build

681
00:25:44.988 --> 00:25:47.260
ourselves up, because we're so afraid

682
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.966
that other people are gonna see us

683
00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:50.982
as being too egotistical.

684
00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:52.156
Now those are generalities.

685
00:25:52.156 --> 00:25:54.310
<v woman>Yeah but that's a huge flaw.</v>

686
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.365
That's a huge flaw in our thinking.

687
00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:02.875
There's a notion of modesty and humility

688
00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:06.511
that has a lot of baggage with it.

689
00:26:06.511 --> 00:26:11.141
<v ->Absolutely because we have downplayed</v>

690
00:26:11.141 --> 00:26:13.242
the importance of our human ego.

691
00:26:13.242 --> 00:26:15.909
It's what helps us survive in our physical body

692
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:18.447
and we've associated a lot of the negative

693
00:26:18.447 --> 00:26:22.266
to that human ego, so it's like we've

694
00:26:22.266 --> 00:26:25.007
separated our self from our self.

695
00:26:25.007 --> 00:26:26.468
That physical part of us that needs

696
00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:28.665
to survive through ego, and that

697
00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:30.723
learns our lessons, and does our work,

698
00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:33.198
and makes a change in this world,

699
00:26:33.198 --> 00:26:35.022
is very important.

700
00:26:35.022 --> 00:26:37.081
But we have become changed in our

701
00:26:37.081 --> 00:26:39.826
perception of humility.

702
00:26:39.826 --> 00:26:41.902
I always say that the greatest gift

703
00:26:41.902 --> 00:26:44.119
of who we are is when we can look

704
00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:45.539
in the mirror and we can fall in love

705
00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:48.195
with our self everyday, and to do it

706
00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:50.275
without wondering what are people

707
00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.301
going to think or oh, Carol, you shouldn't

708
00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:54.594
think that because my gosh then people

709
00:26:54.594 --> 00:26:56.770
are going to imply, you're going to

710
00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.253
imply that your'e more special.

711
00:26:58.253 --> 00:26:59.917
I'm not at all.

712
00:26:59.917 --> 00:27:02.519
So I think that's part of the shift.

713
00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:04.695
And as we're looking at all of this,

714
00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:07.906
the shift isn't just in one area.

715
00:27:07.906 --> 00:27:10.828
It's touching every aspect of our being.

716
00:27:10.828 --> 00:27:13.164
Our earth, our selves, our emotions,

717
00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:17.221
our consciousness, our truth, just everything.

718
00:27:18.262 --> 00:27:20.235
Our political system.

719
00:27:20.235 --> 00:27:21.761
There's not a part of our society

720
00:27:21.761 --> 00:27:25.386
that isn't being challenged and

721
00:27:25.386 --> 00:27:27.103
challenge always brings change.

722
00:27:27.103 --> 00:27:28.971
And if you don't like change, it's a problem.

723
00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:31.008
If you do, then it's a good thing.

724
00:27:31.008 --> 00:27:32.267
<v woman>It's a good thing.</v>

725
00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:36.360
Well going back to more our generation,

726
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.869
that came here when you had one set

727
00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:41.290
of frequencies in place that have shifted

728
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:46.037
rather dramatically, there's also a lot of

729
00:27:46.037 --> 00:27:48.543
energy behind the information that our

730
00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:50.026
DNA is changing.

731
00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:51.039
<v ->Oh absolutely.</v>

732
00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.116
<v woman>And can you talk about</v>

733
00:27:52.116 --> 00:27:53.663
we're works in progress ourselves.

734
00:27:53.663 --> 00:27:55.305
They're coming in with the new DNA,

735
00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:58.493
but our DNA is changing, what does that mean?

736
00:27:58.493 --> 00:28:00.916
<v ->Well the truth is, is that people that</v>

737
00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:03.539
I've worked with that study the molecular

738
00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:05.747
biology of who we are, the bottom line

739
00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:09.288
of it is, we have the same capability

740
00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:11.720
as these children do in our DNA.

741
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.408
We have aspects of the DNA that

742
00:28:14.408 --> 00:28:16.360
have never been turned on.

743
00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.416
<v woman>The codons for example.</v>

744
00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:19.144
<v ->The codons, they've never been turned on.</v>

745
00:28:19.144 --> 00:28:21.297
And we're learning that children are coming

746
00:28:21.297 --> 00:28:23.965
in with more active codons than we have.

747
00:28:23.965 --> 00:28:27.137
So as a result, their immune system is

748
00:28:27.137 --> 00:28:29.318
able to deal with things differently.

749
00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:30.962
But you and I can do that.

750
00:28:30.962 --> 00:28:32.124
<v woman>So let's talk about that.</v>

751
00:28:32.124 --> 00:28:33.927
How do we take our bodies that are

752
00:28:33.927 --> 00:28:36.103
a work in progress, and start evolving

753
00:28:36.103 --> 00:28:38.801
them to the next level that these kids

754
00:28:38.801 --> 00:28:42.438
are already demonstrating, we're becoming?

755
00:28:42.438 --> 00:28:45.649
<v ->It sounds almost trite, but we literally</v>

756
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:48.049
change our thought.

757
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:50.608
Thought is energy, and any thought

758
00:28:50.608 --> 00:28:52.944
that we create in our mind, all of the

759
00:28:52.944 --> 00:28:54.694
sudden when it becomes fixed, gets

760
00:28:54.694 --> 00:28:56.880
an emotional charge, in the world of energy,

761
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.629
it leaves you.

762
00:28:58.629 --> 00:29:00.378
And it's going to go out there and

763
00:29:00.378 --> 00:29:02.554
it's going to find those who are like minded

764
00:29:02.554 --> 00:29:05.296
that are going to support this thought.

765
00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:08.122
And if we can change one thought about

766
00:29:08.122 --> 00:29:10.191
our self, or one thought about how we

767
00:29:10.191 --> 00:29:12.570
live our quality of life, or one thought

768
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.863
about how we interact with people,

769
00:29:14.863 --> 00:29:16.879
just merely one thought, is kind of

770
00:29:16.879 --> 00:29:19.887
like dropping a pebble in the pond.

771
00:29:19.887 --> 00:29:21.689
And it becomes larger and larger,

772
00:29:21.689 --> 00:29:23.684
the more that it becomes the same

773
00:29:23.684 --> 00:29:25.188
with like minded people, and pretty soon

774
00:29:25.188 --> 00:29:28.601
we have a change that's going to shift.

775
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:31.406
And so that's our work.

776
00:29:31.406 --> 00:29:34.263
<v woman>Right, and even staying</v>

777
00:29:34.263 --> 00:29:36.579
in the physical realm of it alone,

778
00:29:36.579 --> 00:29:39.448
to not buy into the concepts, the mythology

779
00:29:39.448 --> 00:29:43.981
that our society lives to be 73.2 years old,

780
00:29:43.981 --> 00:29:46.050
ectetera, ectetera, and we just start

781
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.674
having degenerative processes set in

782
00:29:48.674 --> 00:29:51.373
after the age of 50, we need to really unplug

783
00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:54.242
from all of that, it's now old information.

784
00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:55.660
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

785
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.102
And the thing is, is that we buy into it.

786
00:29:58.102 --> 00:30:01.324
I work a lot with doctors and I work

787
00:30:01.324 --> 00:30:03.297
a lot with their patients, and doctors

788
00:30:03.297 --> 00:30:06.614
are mandated to say that this is stage

789
00:30:06.614 --> 00:30:10.081
four cancer, this is the likely livelihood of it.

790
00:30:10.081 --> 00:30:11.894
And it could be anywhere from 15 days

791
00:30:11.894 --> 00:30:15.286
to 3 years, I mean that's what they have to do.

792
00:30:15.286 --> 00:30:19.328
But they're not God, or this supreme being,

793
00:30:19.328 --> 00:30:21.579
or what anybody would like to call it.

794
00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:24.693
That person doesn't have to buy into that.

795
00:30:24.693 --> 00:30:28.512
And if they do, then the law of manifestation

796
00:30:28.512 --> 00:30:31.925
is then they will transition within that time.

797
00:30:31.925 --> 00:30:33.247
Or they come out of there, and they go,

798
00:30:33.247 --> 00:30:35.722
you know what, I'm just not gonna buy into that.

799
00:30:35.722 --> 00:30:37.268
I'm gonna try some things, and if I only am

800
00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.178
gonna live 15 days, they're gonna be the best

801
00:30:39.178 --> 00:30:42.079
15 days of my life.

802
00:30:42.079 --> 00:30:43.913
And that in itself is healing because

803
00:30:43.913 --> 00:30:45.375
now you're not gonna do all the things

804
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:47.017
that you did before.

805
00:30:47.017 --> 00:30:48.446
<v woman>Exactly, and you're going to live it</v>

806
00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.718
with more hopefully gusto, passion, and joy.

807
00:30:50.718 --> 00:30:51.668
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

808
00:30:51.668 --> 00:30:53.235
And integrity, and the truth of who we are,

809
00:30:53.235 --> 00:30:56.178
instead of sitting around and aunt Jemaine

810
00:30:56.178 --> 00:30:57.907
comes in and she just bugs the daylight

811
00:30:57.907 --> 00:30:59.272
out of you, and you don't say anything.

812
00:30:59.272 --> 00:31:00.488
All the sudden comes in and goes

813
00:31:00.488 --> 00:31:02.536
you know you really bug me and it's

814
00:31:02.536 --> 00:31:05.000
like oh, that was really good.

815
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.790
<v woman>That felt good.</v>

816
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.146
Well we're here at the heart of healing

817
00:31:08.146 --> 00:31:11.240
conference, and the whole theme of

818
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.373
energy medicine, which is you're under

819
00:31:13.373 --> 00:31:15.602
the category of energy medicine,

820
00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:17.245
is what's dominating this theme.

821
00:31:17.245 --> 00:31:18.972
And the whole subject of the heart

822
00:31:18.972 --> 00:31:21.884
of healing, what about the actual,

823
00:31:21.884 --> 00:31:24.465
how do you see the heart?

824
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:25.766
What does the heart mean?

825
00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:27.676
<v ->There's actually two hearts</v>

826
00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:29.340
in how I see the field.

827
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.516
There's of course the physical heart

828
00:31:31.516 --> 00:31:33.361
that is literally the pump that moves

829
00:31:33.361 --> 00:31:35.376
the blood and all that, yaddi, yaddi, yaddi.

830
00:31:35.376 --> 00:31:37.179
But the bottom line of it is, that's the heart

831
00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:40.368
that we use to interact with our outer world.

832
00:31:40.368 --> 00:31:42.523
It's where we look for love outside of

833
00:31:42.523 --> 00:31:45.488
ourselves, we share love outside of ourselves.

834
00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:46.971
But there's another heart called

835
00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:49.083
the ethereal, that's the soul heart.

836
00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:50.992
And between where the heart is located

837
00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:53.904
right here, and between our voice

838
00:31:53.904 --> 00:31:55.097
and speaking our truth, there's

839
00:31:55.097 --> 00:31:57.658
this void, or this abyss that it's called,

840
00:31:57.658 --> 00:32:00.421
and that's where our soul, and our love,

841
00:32:00.421 --> 00:32:02.191
and our love for self.

842
00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:03.364
So there's a heart for loving others,

843
00:32:03.364 --> 00:32:05.924
and there's a heart for loving ourselves.

844
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.367
And when we love ourselves, again

845
00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:10.563
that's a comment that a lot of people go,

846
00:32:10.563 --> 00:32:12.025
well, Carol, what does that mean?

847
00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:13.774
It means again broken record.

848
00:32:13.774 --> 00:32:15.065
Look in the mirror and find something

849
00:32:15.065 --> 00:32:17.017
beautiful about yourself and fall in love

850
00:32:17.017 --> 00:32:18.627
with yourself.

851
00:32:18.627 --> 00:32:20.430
<v woman>Hmm, that's so hard for</v>

852
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.542
people in probably all over the world

853
00:32:22.542 --> 00:32:24.718
but certainly in Western culture.

854
00:32:24.718 --> 00:32:26.264
All we can see is our flaws, what needs

855
00:32:26.264 --> 00:32:28.824
to be covered up, or altered, or colored.

856
00:32:28.824 --> 00:32:30.552
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

857
00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:33.155
And again, the gift of that is, is that

858
00:32:33.155 --> 00:32:34.776
you and I could make a difference,

859
00:32:34.776 --> 00:32:36.173
and we could look in the mirror

860
00:32:36.173 --> 00:32:38.637
and we could see something different.

861
00:32:38.637 --> 00:32:39.383
<v woman>Well let's go beyond</v>

862
00:32:39.383 --> 00:32:41.090
the physical, into the chakras.

863
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.315
Now a wise being that I respect

864
00:32:45.315 --> 00:32:49.256
told me a few years ago that with

865
00:32:49.256 --> 00:32:51.869
some of the people, it's no longer

866
00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.255
necessary to be putting a lot of

867
00:32:53.255 --> 00:32:55.325
attention and energy into the lower

868
00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:56.668
three chakras.

869
00:32:56.668 --> 00:32:57.863
Those have been over-developed

870
00:32:57.863 --> 00:32:59.878
in the human species and now that

871
00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:02.215
the base chakra starts with the heart,

872
00:33:02.215 --> 00:33:03.996
and we start looking at the system

873
00:33:03.996 --> 00:33:06.908
as it moves into the chakras above the head.

874
00:33:06.908 --> 00:33:08.006
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

875
00:33:08.006 --> 00:33:09.180
<v woman>Now can you tell me your</v>

876
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.481
truth of that, or experience with that.

877
00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:12.753
<v ->Exactly the same truth with that,</v>

878
00:33:12.753 --> 00:33:14.907
is that again the lower chakras

879
00:33:14.907 --> 00:33:17.242
is really where all illness begins

880
00:33:17.242 --> 00:33:19.376
in the physical body.

881
00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:21.510
While it may begin in the thought,

882
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.771
in the chemistry change, in the brain,

883
00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:25.979
around that thought, it's really tied

884
00:33:25.979 --> 00:33:27.525
to the lower three chakras that

885
00:33:27.525 --> 00:33:29.989
we really manifest our ilnesses.

886
00:33:29.989 --> 00:33:32.848
And what we're doing is we've moved

887
00:33:32.848 --> 00:33:34.778
from curing to wanting to heal.

888
00:33:34.778 --> 00:33:36.717
And that means that we have to look

889
00:33:36.717 --> 00:33:38.436
at things differently.

890
00:33:38.436 --> 00:33:42.180
So we have choices, and I think

891
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.740
that that's really the pivotal key

892
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.852
as far as whether we heal or whether

893
00:33:46.852 --> 00:33:49.945
we stay in the thinking that we were,

894
00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:51.705
that somebody else needs to heal us,

895
00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:53.817
instead of us participating.

896
00:33:53.817 --> 00:33:56.441
But when you touch that heart,

897
00:33:56.441 --> 00:33:59.511
the physical human heart, and you

898
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:01.827
realize how precious love is, and how

899
00:34:01.827 --> 00:34:05.240
precious the sharing of exchange

900
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.947
of information, excuse me, I'm gonna

901
00:34:06.947 --> 00:34:09.304
tell you a quick story on this.

902
00:34:09.304 --> 00:34:11.564
One of the things that I learned

903
00:34:11.564 --> 00:34:12.824
when I was in this transitional

904
00:34:12.824 --> 00:34:15.181
time and my death time is the most

905
00:34:15.181 --> 00:34:16.802
precious gift we have in our physical

906
00:34:16.802 --> 00:34:19.362
body, are our five sense.

907
00:34:19.362 --> 00:34:20.823
To be able to look in someone's eyes

908
00:34:20.823 --> 00:34:22.615
and truly see them, or to smell them,

909
00:34:22.615 --> 00:34:25.399
or to taste that mocha at 3:00 in the afternoon,

910
00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:27.777
those are really precious things.

911
00:34:27.777 --> 00:34:29.665
But we don't place a lot of value

912
00:34:29.665 --> 00:34:32.183
on what they bring to us.

913
00:34:32.183 --> 00:34:34.657
And so as we kind of get into this

914
00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:37.323
shift of consciousness in our self,

915
00:34:37.323 --> 00:34:39.233
then what we realize is that we

916
00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:42.955
don't negate that specialness of us.

917
00:34:42.955 --> 00:34:45.099
And we use the five physical senses

918
00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:47.424
to not just see the obvious.

919
00:34:47.424 --> 00:34:49.408
And it changes.

920
00:34:49.408 --> 00:34:51.263
And you can only touch your soul

921
00:34:51.263 --> 00:34:53.408
through your heart.

922
00:34:53.408 --> 00:34:56.565
Through self love, through doing things

923
00:34:56.565 --> 00:34:58.186
that are important to you, rather

924
00:34:58.186 --> 00:35:00.725
than doing things that are urgent to others.

925
00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:01.929
Self care.

926
00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:03.039
<v woman>Let's talk about how</v>

927
00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:04.405
we do that through our senses.

928
00:35:04.405 --> 00:35:05.780
The ways in which we can nurture that

929
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.714
through the physical senses even.

930
00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:10.111
<v ->We can do it through the sense</v>

931
00:35:10.111 --> 00:35:12.511
of smell through aromatherapy.

932
00:35:12.511 --> 00:35:14.099
Or we can do something as simple as

933
00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:16.286
walking past a rose and bending over

934
00:35:16.286 --> 00:35:18.708
and smelling it, or we can look at

935
00:35:18.708 --> 00:35:22.569
the face of a pansy, or we can look

936
00:35:22.569 --> 00:35:24.051
at the blue of the sky.

937
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:26.632
We can just appreciate the things

938
00:35:26.632 --> 00:35:30.611
that are so obvious that we really don't see.

939
00:35:30.611 --> 00:35:31.752
The formation of clouds.

940
00:35:31.752 --> 00:35:32.904
Do you remember as a child you

941
00:35:32.904 --> 00:35:34.684
look at the clouds and you'd go, oh do you

942
00:35:34.684 --> 00:35:36.370
see that elephant up there in that cloud?

943
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.340
<v woman>Yeah or the bunny.</v>

944
00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.783
<v ->The bunny or the things, we don't do that.</v>

945
00:35:39.783 --> 00:35:41.245
So those are the ways that we can use

946
00:35:41.245 --> 00:35:42.865
our physical senses.

947
00:35:42.865 --> 00:35:46.427
The ability to taste food, and to enjoy

948
00:35:46.427 --> 00:35:49.627
the flavors, and to just savor it,

949
00:35:49.627 --> 00:35:52.114
instead of going no I really should't eat that.

950
00:35:52.114 --> 00:35:54.577
Instead of not eating it, why don't you

951
00:35:54.577 --> 00:35:56.838
just take a little tiny bite of it, and just

952
00:35:56.838 --> 00:35:58.459
let it melt in your mouth?

953
00:35:58.459 --> 00:35:59.601
<v woman>I'm big on that, I'm a taster.</v>

954
00:35:59.601 --> 00:36:00.997
I want to taste everything.

955
00:36:00.997 --> 00:36:03.312
<v ->Absolutely, and even through taste,</v>

956
00:36:03.312 --> 00:36:05.169
you have the bitter and you have the sweet.

957
00:36:05.169 --> 00:36:08.176
I mean that's kind of what life is all about.

958
00:36:08.176 --> 00:36:09.659
The bitter isn't that it's bad,

959
00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:11.707
it's just a different taste, a different

960
00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:13.607
way to look at it.

961
00:36:13.607 --> 00:36:15.855
<v woman>So then if we begin this</v>

962
00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:18.159
journey of refinement as it were.

963
00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:19.396
<v ->Good word.</v>

964
00:36:19.396 --> 00:36:21.647
<v woman>Being childlike, and utilizing</v>

965
00:36:21.647 --> 00:36:24.740
our senses with our conscious awareness,

966
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.490
which is childlike.

967
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.587
<v ->It is, absolutely.</v>

968
00:36:27.587 --> 00:36:28.741
<v woman>Kids usually use their senses</v>

969
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:30.041
full on, and get lost in the feeling,

970
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:32.067
or the touch, the feel, the color.

971
00:36:32.067 --> 00:36:33.540
<v ->Right.</v>

972
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.371
<v woman>Would you say that's</v>

973
00:36:34.371 --> 00:36:36.036
a good place to begin our journey?

974
00:36:36.036 --> 00:36:38.553
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

975
00:36:38.553 --> 00:36:40.121
One of the things I'll say to people

976
00:36:40.121 --> 00:36:43.758
when was the last time you picked up a crayon?

977
00:36:43.758 --> 00:36:46.925
You can't sit down and color, and not

978
00:36:46.925 --> 00:36:48.857
become a child.

979
00:36:48.857 --> 00:36:50.457
Not only the vibrations, the color,

980
00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:53.282
the activity, the fun.

981
00:36:53.282 --> 00:36:55.330
We start out, I've done work shops on this,

982
00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.592
we start out, and art therapy does

983
00:36:57.592 --> 00:36:58.828
a lot of this, but we start out kind of

984
00:36:58.828 --> 00:37:00.579
coloring in the lines and it's like well

985
00:37:00.579 --> 00:37:02.711
I think I'm just gonna color, oh my gosh,

986
00:37:02.711 --> 00:37:04.097
I colored outside the lines.

987
00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:05.761
Well I'll color a little more, a little more.

988
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:07.628
So absolutely.

989
00:37:07.628 --> 00:37:11.374
And just laughing.

990
00:37:11.374 --> 00:37:12.962
Again this is one of the probably

991
00:37:12.962 --> 00:37:17.067
more it effects everyone but it's

992
00:37:17.067 --> 00:37:21.355
for me, is that you need to laugh everyday.

993
00:37:21.355 --> 00:37:23.222
This isn't brain surgery.

994
00:37:23.222 --> 00:37:24.598
You wake up and you should be like

995
00:37:24.598 --> 00:37:26.389
that little kid on Christmas morning,

996
00:37:26.389 --> 00:37:27.872
you just can't wait to get out of bed

997
00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:29.654
and get going.

998
00:37:29.654 --> 00:37:32.725
And just find out whatever life's gonna give you.

999
00:37:32.725 --> 00:37:34.400
<v woman>What about the animal kingdom?</v>

1000
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.743
Because they're going through the shifts

1001
00:37:35.743 --> 00:37:37.461
right alongside us.

1002
00:37:37.461 --> 00:37:39.637
Can you talk a little bit about your

1003
00:37:39.637 --> 00:37:42.260
view, your vision of what you see

1004
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.679
in the animal kingdom?

1005
00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.024
<v ->Oh there's a tremendous shift</v>

1006
00:37:45.024 --> 00:37:47.092
in their fields also, because they

1007
00:37:47.092 --> 00:37:49.822
really are great healers to us.

1008
00:37:49.822 --> 00:37:53.150
And the greatest gift is, they're able

1009
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.487
to take those emotional charges

1010
00:37:55.487 --> 00:37:57.759
that we keep pent up, and they

1011
00:37:57.759 --> 00:38:00.426
actually will take it on in their field.

1012
00:38:00.426 --> 00:38:02.783
They're unlike humans that we tend

1013
00:38:02.783 --> 00:38:05.181
to try to contain our self, animals

1014
00:38:05.181 --> 00:38:07.817
are very fluid, and so they can

1015
00:38:07.817 --> 00:38:09.502
take on emotions, they can take on

1016
00:38:09.502 --> 00:38:12.637
actual physical ailments of their owners.

1017
00:38:12.637 --> 00:38:14.483
And they'll transmute it.

1018
00:38:14.483 --> 00:38:16.072
It's just like it just kind of goes

1019
00:38:16.072 --> 00:38:17.470
from you, goes into their field,

1020
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.645
and just kind of goes away.

1021
00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:22.045
And just filters out.

1022
00:38:22.045 --> 00:38:23.261
Great healers.

1023
00:38:23.261 --> 00:38:25.309
But because the emotions are so strong

1024
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:28.231
right now and the fear is so strong right now,

1025
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:32.520
the animals, their fields are being used up.

1026
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.815
They're not able to stay as fluid.

1027
00:38:35.815 --> 00:38:38.919
It's almost like we're bombarding them

1028
00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:41.788
with this mother of all fear, and I'm not

1029
00:38:41.788 --> 00:38:44.262
even sure what that is cause it's so different.

1030
00:38:44.262 --> 00:38:46.343
And they too don't know how to deal with this.

1031
00:38:46.343 --> 00:38:49.201
So they're in an evolutionary cycle.

1032
00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.460
And I believe that we are having

1033
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.190
more animals that are checking out.

1034
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.333
<v woman>Having human-like health problems.</v>

1035
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.945
Dying at a much younger age.

1036
00:38:56.945 --> 00:38:57.936
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1037
00:38:57.936 --> 00:38:59.846
I had a woman come in for a reading

1038
00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:02.832
that brought this cat, Jeremiah was its name.

1039
00:39:02.832 --> 00:39:04.891
And so she came in, and she kinda

1040
00:39:04.891 --> 00:39:06.308
hung around, and Jeremiah's walking

1041
00:39:06.308 --> 00:39:08.805
around my office, and gets up in my chair,

1042
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:10.842
and I said okay, are we ready to start the work

1043
00:39:10.842 --> 00:39:12.079
and the reading?

1044
00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.498
She said yes, well Jeremiah wouldn't get

1045
00:39:13.498 --> 00:39:15.556
out of my chair, so Carols' on the floor.

1046
00:39:15.556 --> 00:39:17.401
(laughing)

1047
00:39:17.401 --> 00:39:18.841
And I looked at Jeremiah and I thought

1048
00:39:18.841 --> 00:39:22.543
oh my gosh, you have a urinary tract issue.

1049
00:39:22.543 --> 00:39:24.346
And I turned my head to the owner,

1050
00:39:24.346 --> 00:39:25.892
and I thought, oh my gosh, you have

1051
00:39:25.892 --> 00:39:28.153
a urinary tract issue.

1052
00:39:28.153 --> 00:39:29.912
And I looked at Jeremiah, and as

1053
00:39:29.912 --> 00:39:32.516
quick as I saw that, as woo-woo

1054
00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:35.140
as it sounds, it was gone.

1055
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.377
It was like Jeremiah just said

1056
00:39:36.377 --> 00:39:38.798
I'm in your chair, you're on the floor,

1057
00:39:38.798 --> 00:39:42.264
this is what it is, do your work, now it's done.

1058
00:39:42.264 --> 00:39:43.320
<v woman>So they can transmute it</v>

1059
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.750
really quickly because they don't have

1060
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.071
those same belief systems.

1061
00:39:46.071 --> 00:39:47.148
<v ->They don't believe they have to</v>

1062
00:39:47.148 --> 00:39:49.079
protect themselves, we as humans

1063
00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:51.618
spend a lot of time trying to protect ourselves.

1064
00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:53.282
And what that really does is it pulls

1065
00:39:53.282 --> 00:39:56.567
our field in close to us, and we're not

1066
00:39:56.567 --> 00:39:59.681
designed to be in that protection.

1067
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:02.039
We're designed to be expansive.

1068
00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:04.226
So this belief that we have to protect

1069
00:40:04.226 --> 00:40:07.052
ourselves, in a lot of ways is causing

1070
00:40:07.052 --> 00:40:10.016
a lot of our problems in our body.

1071
00:40:10.016 --> 00:40:11.244
<v woman>I want to come back where</v>

1072
00:40:11.244 --> 00:40:12.619
we were when we were interrupted

1073
00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:15.041
all those times, you just mentioned emotions.

1074
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.238
You were just mentioning the emotions again.

1075
00:40:17.238 --> 00:40:19.606
And you were saying that they are so

1076
00:40:19.606 --> 00:40:21.377
much more pronounced and dramatic

1077
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:25.302
now than ever, because of the fear factor.

1078
00:40:26.822 --> 00:40:29.590
How can we begin taking this one on

1079
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.287
and working with it?

1080
00:40:32.287 --> 00:40:35.696
How do we get past the fear?

1081
00:40:35.696 --> 00:40:37.027
<v ->Mmm.</v>

1082
00:40:37.027 --> 00:40:38.039
<v woman>I know that's a big question</v>

1083
00:40:38.039 --> 00:40:39.661
and it's not fair to ask on one level.

1084
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:40.886
<v ->No, no, not at all.</v>

1085
00:40:40.886 --> 00:40:42.572
<v woman>I would like your opinion.</v>

1086
00:40:42.572 --> 00:40:45.782
<v ->I think the first thing is, and this</v>

1087
00:40:45.782 --> 00:40:48.909
is my own perception of it is,

1088
00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:50.082
I think that we need to have more

1089
00:40:50.082 --> 00:40:52.589
time leisure, leisure time, we have to

1090
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:53.868
have more time to play.

1091
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.628
We need to disconnect from the

1092
00:40:55.628 --> 00:40:57.282
cell phones, and the blackberries,

1093
00:40:57.282 --> 00:40:59.617
and the TV, and the media, and the

1094
00:40:59.617 --> 00:41:01.420
different things, and not that all

1095
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.609
of that is negative, because it's really

1096
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:06.603
expanded our world to be global.

1097
00:41:06.603 --> 00:41:08.428
So there's some benefits.

1098
00:41:08.428 --> 00:41:09.772
But gosh how many times have you

1099
00:41:09.772 --> 00:41:12.801
been somewhere and seen someone

1100
00:41:12.801 --> 00:41:14.955
in this beautiful place in nature,

1101
00:41:14.955 --> 00:41:16.960
and all of the sudden their darn phone rings

1102
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.080
and they're on the phone, and their kids

1103
00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.767
are jumping around, all they want to do is play.

1104
00:41:20.767 --> 00:41:23.488
We lost the ability to be able to do that,

1105
00:41:23.488 --> 00:41:26.250
and I think we need to be able to unplug ourselves.

1106
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.859
And when we do, then we're not going

1107
00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:31.711
to be as visually or auditory in the

1108
00:41:31.711 --> 00:41:35.454
constant bombardment of fear, paranoia,

1109
00:41:35.454 --> 00:41:38.793
panic, stock market, all the things

1110
00:41:38.793 --> 00:41:40.126
that we do.

1111
00:41:40.126 --> 00:41:42.302
Again don't put your head in the sand.

1112
00:41:42.302 --> 00:41:45.288
But unplug.

1113
00:41:45.288 --> 00:41:47.198
And just have a little time to maybe

1114
00:41:47.198 --> 00:41:49.577
have some free thinking.

1115
00:41:49.577 --> 00:41:51.304
Maybe not really do any kind of

1116
00:41:51.304 --> 00:41:53.032
critical thinking at all, maybe just

1117
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:56.585
enjoy the scenery, enjoy where you are.

1118
00:41:56.585 --> 00:42:00.126
20 minutes a day of relaxing thoughts

1119
00:42:00.126 --> 00:42:03.272
can reduce hypertension so quickly.

1120
00:42:03.272 --> 00:42:05.064
And it's a wonderful pain management

1121
00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:07.580
for chronic fatigue and a lot of chronic

1122
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.280
ailments that we have now in our society.

1123
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.191
20 minutes of just allowing the mind

1124
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:15.730
to just wander and not worry.

1125
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:16.882
<v woman>Hmm.</v>

1126
00:42:16.882 --> 00:42:18.226
What about being outdoors.

1127
00:42:18.226 --> 00:42:19.890
Just simple elements such as nature,

1128
00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.001
because of course the fear tactics

1129
00:42:22.001 --> 00:42:23.954
have made their way deep into the

1130
00:42:23.954 --> 00:42:26.288
psyche where oh I can't go out

1131
00:42:26.288 --> 00:42:28.871
without 30 block sunscreen, I hear

1132
00:42:28.871 --> 00:42:31.333
women and men say these things.

1133
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:34.300
And afraid of cancer, afraid of the sun.

1134
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.676
<v ->Well and absolutely.</v>

1135
00:42:35.676 --> 00:42:38.097
In many ways from the standpoint

1136
00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:41.104
of where we are in the atmosphere

1137
00:42:41.104 --> 00:42:43.803
itself, there's truth to that.

1138
00:42:43.803 --> 00:42:46.363
But the other thing is, we have to have

1139
00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:49.348
the sun to create the vitamin D that

1140
00:42:49.348 --> 00:42:51.600
we need in order for our skin to replenish,

1141
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.041
and our cells to rejuvenate and everything.

1142
00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:56.442
And I think what we've done is we've

1143
00:42:56.442 --> 00:43:00.101
gone to extremes, we used to back when

1144
00:43:00.101 --> 00:43:03.247
I was younger, I'd lay in the sun for four

1145
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:04.548
and five hours.

1146
00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:05.626
<v woman>Me too.</v>

1147
00:43:05.626 --> 00:43:07.897
<v ->The more golden the tan, the better it was.</v>

1148
00:43:07.897 --> 00:43:09.304
To now, where we don't want to be

1149
00:43:09.304 --> 00:43:11.535
in the sun five minutes without something.

1150
00:43:11.535 --> 00:43:14.456
Somewhere there's gotta be some common sense.

1151
00:43:14.456 --> 00:43:15.501
And I think that that--

1152
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:17.613
<v woman>Put sunscreen on, but got out in it, right?</v>

1153
00:43:17.613 --> 00:43:19.704
<v ->Well and the truth is, I mean dermatologists</v>

1154
00:43:19.704 --> 00:43:21.913
are gonna probably scream, but the bottom

1155
00:43:21.913 --> 00:43:23.842
line of it is, go outside and sit in the sun

1156
00:43:23.842 --> 00:43:26.605
for five minutes.

1157
00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:28.951
Just allow the warmth of the sun,

1158
00:43:28.951 --> 00:43:31.811
the feeling how it loosens the muscles.

1159
00:43:31.811 --> 00:43:34.274
How it just relaxes you, how it changes

1160
00:43:34.274 --> 00:43:36.407
your breathing, how you absorb it

1161
00:43:36.407 --> 00:43:38.338
through the pores of your skin.

1162
00:43:38.338 --> 00:43:41.239
Gee just five minutes can start the process.

1163
00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:42.701
What we're doing now is we're looking

1164
00:43:42.701 --> 00:43:44.950
for supplements, which certainly is

1165
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.211
going to give us what we need, but gosh

1166
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:49.548
it takes away the pleasure of the five senses.

1167
00:43:49.548 --> 00:43:52.556
I mean getting vitamin D 3 in a capsule

1168
00:43:52.556 --> 00:43:55.415
is I don't know, I don't get very much

1169
00:43:55.415 --> 00:43:57.227
enjoyment out of that, how about you?

1170
00:43:57.227 --> 00:43:59.019
<v woman>No, no.</v>

1171
00:43:59.019 --> 00:44:02.081
So what does the sun do to the aura as well?

1172
00:44:02.081 --> 00:44:05.024
<v ->Oh it makes us fluffy.</v>

1173
00:44:05.024 --> 00:44:06.432
It makes us fluffy.

1174
00:44:06.432 --> 00:44:09.440
The truth is you can't be out in nature

1175
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.384
and you can't be with a tree, and not

1176
00:44:12.384 --> 00:44:14.453
become the tree, you can't be with

1177
00:44:14.453 --> 00:44:16.672
a flower, and not become the flower.

1178
00:44:16.672 --> 00:44:19.104
You can't be with the sun and if we

1179
00:44:19.104 --> 00:44:21.630
go back into a lot of the ancient

1180
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:24.799
writings, as far as the ways to heal

1181
00:44:24.799 --> 00:44:27.945
ourselves back in the Egyptian meta-physicians,

1182
00:44:27.945 --> 00:44:29.960
one of the things that they said is

1183
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.806
that you go out and you sit in the sun,

1184
00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:34.015
and you allow the sun god of Ra to be

1185
00:44:34.015 --> 00:44:36.212
able to heal what ails you and so forth.

1186
00:44:36.212 --> 00:44:39.444
I mean that's one of the basic parts of who we are.

1187
00:44:39.444 --> 00:44:41.757
Now there are things that you need to do,

1188
00:44:41.757 --> 00:44:43.229
as far as protecting, if you're gonna be

1189
00:44:43.229 --> 00:44:45.277
out for a long time but gosh we've

1190
00:44:45.277 --> 00:44:48.370
kind of taken away a lot of our spontaneity.

1191
00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.608
All the things that were really--

1192
00:44:49.608 --> 00:44:51.453
<v woman>What's happened to us?</v>

1193
00:44:51.453 --> 00:44:53.107
<v ->Well this is your job and my job</v>

1194
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:54.973
is to bring back those things and

1195
00:44:54.973 --> 00:44:57.148
start at moderation, and maybe

1196
00:44:57.148 --> 00:44:59.303
we'll change from the fact that

1197
00:44:59.303 --> 00:45:00.722
we go out five minute a day, and

1198
00:45:00.722 --> 00:45:02.086
we don't get melanoma.

1199
00:45:02.086 --> 00:45:05.085
Maybe that's the--I don't know.

1200
00:45:05.085 --> 00:45:07.345
<v woman>Well you're certainly</v>

1201
00:45:07.345 --> 00:45:10.633
doing your part, and you're radiating

1202
00:45:10.633 --> 00:45:13.362
your talk, so obviously you've taken

1203
00:45:13.362 --> 00:45:15.334
these principals onboard yourself.

1204
00:45:15.334 --> 00:45:17.350
Any other last thoughts or along

1205
00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.846
the way, along this journey of re-awakening

1206
00:45:19.846 --> 00:45:22.139
into our senses, unplugging from the information

1207
00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:25.189
sources that aren't supporting us anymore?

1208
00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.141
<v ->Be kind to yourself when you don't,</v>

1209
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.869
because as you said with radiating

1210
00:45:28.869 --> 00:45:32.447
in my field, absolutely, but very, very human.

1211
00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:36.358
The deadlines get me, the sitting in the

1212
00:45:36.358 --> 00:45:39.567
chair for 14 hours writing a book will get me.

1213
00:45:39.567 --> 00:45:41.828
My body is saying get up and just walk, Carol.

1214
00:45:41.828 --> 00:45:43.781
No I'm negotiating with it.

1215
00:45:43.781 --> 00:45:46.458
So when you fall into places, don't go

1216
00:45:46.458 --> 00:45:48.069
into the criticalness, don't go into the

1217
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:50.831
negative self talk and the anger.

1218
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.955
As a medical intuitive, I know that

1219
00:45:53.955 --> 00:45:56.270
all self-directed anger is housed

1220
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:58.362
in your spleen, and that's the most

1221
00:45:58.362 --> 00:46:00.473
important part of your immune system.

1222
00:46:00.473 --> 00:46:02.649
And we can't stay angry with our self.

1223
00:46:02.649 --> 00:46:04.548
And Edgar Cayce said also, you can't

1224
00:46:04.548 --> 00:46:06.350
stay angry with yourself and stay

1225
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:08.462
healthy in your body.

1226
00:46:08.462 --> 00:46:09.721
So when you start that negative

1227
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:12.099
self talk, I don't know, come up

1228
00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:13.507
with something.

1229
00:46:13.507 --> 00:46:15.150
Mine is I have a little diddy that i

1230
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.955
put in my mind and I just say that

1231
00:46:17.955 --> 00:46:19.288
little mantra, and it makes me

1232
00:46:19.288 --> 00:46:20.472
giggle and laugh and--

1233
00:46:20.472 --> 00:46:21.421
<v woman>Can you give us an idea</v>

1234
00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:22.360
of some matras that people might

1235
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.725
be able to use if they don't have

1236
00:46:23.725 --> 00:46:25.186
a diddy in their mind already?

1237
00:46:25.186 --> 00:46:29.516
<v ->Show time or go to the crown, or</v>

1238
00:46:29.516 --> 00:46:32.443
laugh a little, just something that

1239
00:46:32.443 --> 00:46:33.634
I'll say to people when I'm doing

1240
00:46:33.634 --> 00:46:35.948
my work shops, a song title is

1241
00:46:35.948 --> 00:46:38.978
a wonderful way, you are my sunshine

1242
00:46:38.978 --> 00:46:40.727
and things, so it's a wonderful way

1243
00:46:40.727 --> 00:46:42.049
to remind us.

1244
00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:44.055
And what it does is when we say that

1245
00:46:44.055 --> 00:46:47.329
to ourselves, we actually release endorphins

1246
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:50.678
and neuro transmitters, and all of those

1247
00:46:50.678 --> 00:46:52.587
tell our body everything's fine.

1248
00:46:52.587 --> 00:46:55.094
Just chill out, it's good, it's gonna all work.

1249
00:46:55.094 --> 00:46:57.302
And that's how we heal.

1250
00:46:57.302 --> 00:46:59.382
<v woman>On that note, zipp-a-dee doo-dah.</v>

1251
00:46:59.382 --> 00:47:01.024
(laughing)

1252
00:47:01.024 --> 00:47:02.613
<v ->Show time.</v>

1253
00:47:02.613 --> 00:47:03.872
<v woman>Thank you so much, Carol.</v>

1254
00:47:03.872 --> 00:47:05.675
You're absolutely delightful.

1255
00:47:05.675 --> 00:47:07.179
And everybody will be able to find you

1256
00:47:07.179 --> 00:47:09.984
on the little link below this window right now.

1257
00:47:09.984 --> 00:47:10.976
Thank you so much.

1258
00:47:10.976 --> 00:47:14.228
<v ->Oh it was my pleasure, thank you.</v>

1259
00:47:14.228 --> 00:47:16.137
<v ->Carol has an institute that assists</v>

1260
00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:17.886
people to recover the use of their

1261
00:47:17.886 --> 00:47:19.977
innate intuitive skills, just click

1262
00:47:19.977 --> 00:47:22.174
on the link to her website below.

1263
00:47:22.174 --> 00:47:23.411
You can also purcahse her books

1264
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:24.894
through that link, meanwhile, our

1265
00:47:24.894 --> 00:47:26.195
interviews with Hazel Courtney

1266
00:47:26.195 --> 00:47:28.126
and Daniel Brinkley also tell of

1267
00:47:28.126 --> 00:47:29.630
what they learned while in the

1268
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:31.251
other dimensions beyond the physical

1269
00:47:31.251 --> 00:47:34.002
world in their near-death-experiences.

1270
00:47:34.002 --> 00:47:36.232
Each story gives us hope, encouragement,

1271
00:47:36.232 --> 00:47:38.973
and a nudge to make a difference in our own lives.

1272
00:47:38.973 --> 00:47:42.114
Until next time, thanks for watching.
