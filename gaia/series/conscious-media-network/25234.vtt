00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:08.562
<v ->If you were raised a Christian, did you ever sit in church</v>

2
00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:11.673
and wonder about the Adam and Eve story as a child?

3
00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:12.730
I did.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.274
How about the theory of evolution?

5
00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:16.434
It made no more sense to me than creationism.

6
00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:17.711
I always felt there was something

7
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:19.742
that made much more sense out there.

8
00:00:19.742 --> 00:00:22.645
Michael Cremo felt the same and has spent 40 plus years

9
00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:25.849
ferreting out missing pieces of our ancient past,

10
00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.103
which he has documented in

11
00:00:27.103 --> 00:00:30.818
Forbidden Archaeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race.

12
00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:33.125
We had a fascinating conversation recently

13
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:34.789
in which he shared his views on why the

14
00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.489
Darwinian theory of evolution has become,

15
00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.694
essentially, state sponsored in spite of a great deal

16
00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:43.517
of scientific evidence to the contrary.

17
00:00:43.517 --> 00:00:45.803
Well, Michael, not to flatter you right out of the shoot,

18
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:47.695
but you have been called in some circles

19
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.271
a dangerous mind, which I absolutely love.

20
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:55.102
The reason for that is because you refuse to

21
00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:58.074
stay inside the box from a very early point in your career.

22
00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:00.385
You jumped right out there into sacred ground

23
00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.322
and started questioning the origins of mankind.

24
00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:05.853
Just to give the viewers who are not already well familiar

25
00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:09.725
with your work an idea of what we're talking about

26
00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:13.935
in terms of the ancient histories of mankind,

27
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.131
go back as far as you care to,

28
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:21.131
and throw in a little evidence for it, as well.

29
00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:23.608
<v ->When I was growing up,</v>

30
00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:26.173
when I was in high school and university,

31
00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:30.748
I accepted the standard ideas about human origins,

32
00:01:30.748 --> 00:01:34.080
and those are the Darwinian evolutionary ideas.

33
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.492
From my teachers I learned that human beings like us

34
00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:43.492
first appeared on Earth about 100 or 200 thousand years ago.

35
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.758
Before that, my teachers told me there were

36
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:48.662
no human beings like us,

37
00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:50.548
there were simply more

38
00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:55.548
primitive, ape-like human ancestors.

39
00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:59.442
Those are the ideas about human origins that I accepted

40
00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.010
for the first part of my life,

41
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.267
but as I grew older and I was searching for

42
00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:09.267
my own path to truth, I was exploring different world views,

43
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:14.291
I looked at the ancient Sanskrit writings of India.

44
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:19.121
I found in them accounts of a human presence on this planet

45
00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:22.326
going back millions and millions of years,

46
00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:24.067
right back to the very beginnings

47
00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:27.562
of the history of life on Earth.

48
00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:31.579
I found such accounts not just in the ancient Sanskrit

49
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.748
writings of Inda, it seemed to be a common feature

50
00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:39.748
of many ancient wisdom traditions that the human species

51
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.990
has a very long presence on this planet,

52
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.380
going back many, many millions of years,

53
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.233
tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of years.

54
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.833
I thought, well that's very interesting.

55
00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:56.029
<v Regina>Significant.</v>

56
00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.911
<v ->Could it be that this is actually true,</v>

57
00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:03.605
or is it simply mythology, fictional,

58
00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:08.249
a kind of invention by the authors of these ancient texts.

59
00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.614
That's what got me questioning what I'd learned

60
00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:17.614
from my teachers in high school and university.

61
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.659
I decided, well, let me look at

62
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.490
the whole history of archaelogy,

63
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.265
because that's where this evidence should be.

64
00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:31.666
It should be something that archaeologists have uncovered,

65
00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:35.173
or other earth scientists, like geologists,

66
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:38.273
or paleontologists, people who are digging into the earth.

67
00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:43.044
They should be finding evidence for a human presence

68
00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:45.587
going back many, many millions of years

69
00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:50.587
if what these ancient writings are saying is true.

70
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.110
I decided to look.

71
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.489
The first place I looked was in text books.

72
00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.726
In the text books, I didn't see any evidence

73
00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:03.095
for extreme human antiquity.

74
00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:07.472
I saw only the discoveries that support

75
00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:11.268
the currently dominant evolutionary theories

76
00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:13.811
about human origins,

77
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.548
but I decided, let me look beyond the text books.

78
00:04:18.548 --> 00:04:22.518
Let me look at the original scientific reports,

79
00:04:22.518 --> 00:04:26.291
published in the professional scientific journals

80
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:31.291
by archaeologists, geologists, and other earth scientists.

81
00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:36.160
Let me see what I find there.

82
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
When I started doing that, I found dozens of reports

83
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.930
of scientists finding human bones, human artifacts,

84
00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:52.108
and human footprints many millions of years old.

85
00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:55.850
That was a surprise to me.

86
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.615
I didn't know I was gonna find that.

87
00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:00.421
I had a suspicion such evidence might be there,

88
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:03.938
but I was really shocked to see just how much

89
00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:07.788
such evidence there was.

90
00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:11.871
Then I had to ask myself a question.

91
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:16.840
If this evidence is there in the original scientific report,

92
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.915
why isn't it in the text books?

93
00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:25.915
That lead me to see there's a process of

94
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.650
knowledge filtration that goes on in the world of science.

95
00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:35.625
It's something that philosophers of science

96
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:39.027
and historians of science have understood for a long time,

97
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:43.903
mainly that theories will sometimes govern

98
00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:47.595
how scientists treat evidence.

99
00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:50.532
If there is a dominant theory

100
00:05:50.532 --> 00:05:53.307
at some particular point in time,

101
00:05:53.307 --> 00:05:58.307
it's quite possible that scientists who are supporters

102
00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:03.918
of that very dominant theory will look at evidence

103
00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:08.295
that supports their theory in a very lenient way.

104
00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:10.498
In other words, this evidence will pass through

105
00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:12.565
their knowledge filter very easily

106
00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.792
and that means students will read about

107
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.662
this evidence in text books,

108
00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:20.506
people will see scientists talking about it

109
00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:23.234
on television specials.

110
00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:25.278
If they go to the local museum,

111
00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:27.878
they'll see these things on display,

112
00:06:27.878 --> 00:06:32.878
but, if there's evidence that radically contradicts

113
00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:37.224
the dominant ideas, it tends to get filtered out.

114
00:06:37.224 --> 00:06:40.719
Not because it's bad evidence, but because it

115
00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.761
contradicts a dominant theory.

116
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:45.526
<v Regina>This goes to the highest levels of science.</v>

117
00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:48.800
Some of the people who have found you to be adversarial

118
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.354
to their work are very high profile names.

119
00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:53.405
<v ->Yes, that's true.</v>

120
00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:55.202
<v Regina>The highest profile names in archaeology,</v>

121
00:06:55.202 --> 00:06:56.209
as a matter of fact.

122
00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.109
<v ->Well, for example, I collected all this evidence</v>

123
00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:04.718
in a book called Forbidden Archaeology.

124
00:07:04.718 --> 00:07:07.980
A lot of different scientists responded to the book,

125
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.218
some high profile archaeologists like Richard Leakey,

126
00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:16.757
for example, said this is just nonsense.

127
00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:20.161
Nobody should take it seriously at all.

128
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:23.029
Whereas there were others who were saying,

129
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.874
well, this is something

130
00:07:26.874 --> 00:07:30.624
that needs to be looked at.

131
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:33.304
For example, there was a prominent

132
00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:36.949
historian of science named David Oldroyd.

133
00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:41.949
He and another author wrote a 23 page review article

134
00:07:41.972 --> 00:07:44.983
about my book Forbidden Archaeology

135
00:07:44.983 --> 00:07:48.766
and it was published in an academic journal

136
00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:51.990
called Social Studies of Science.

137
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.194
He said, well, does this book, Forbidden Archaeology,

138
00:07:55.194 --> 00:08:00.194
make a contribution to the literature on paleoanthropology?

139
00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:04.343
Paleoanthropology is the science of human origins,

140
00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:07.478
and he and his co-author said yes, it does.

141
00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:11.634
First of all, nobody's gone into the history of archaeology

142
00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:15.187
in such depth before.

143
00:08:15.187 --> 00:08:19.119
I was documenting cases that simply aren't mentioned in the

144
00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:24.119
standard text books, the standard histories of science.

145
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:28.361
David Oldroyd and his co-author, Joe Waldeck,

146
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:32.900
also said it's also an important book because

147
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.407
the authors in Michael Cremo and Richard Thompson,

148
00:08:36.407 --> 00:08:40.447
my co-author, raise important questions

149
00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:44.278
about the nature of scientific truth claims.

150
00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:46.983
In other words, sometimes scientists will propose

151
00:08:46.983 --> 00:08:50.487
that a certain idea that they have, or theory that they have

152
00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:55.487
is just established beyond all doubts.

153
00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:57.662
It just has to be accepted.

154
00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.566
It can't be questioned.

155
00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:04.566
The theory of evolution is one of those scientific ideas

156
00:09:04.802 --> 00:09:08.343
or scientific theories that a lot of scientists

157
00:09:08.343 --> 00:09:13.343
today say no reasonable person could possibly question.

158
00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:17.108
These authors thought we had done a good job

159
00:09:17.108 --> 00:09:21.276
in raising some questions about the certainty

160
00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:24.457
of such scientific truth claims.

161
00:09:24.457 --> 00:09:26.791
There was a lot of reaction,

162
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.995
both positive and negative.

163
00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:32.097
<v Regina>What I found kind of intriguing here is that</v>

164
00:09:32.097 --> 00:09:35.963
even a bit of Leakey's own research,

165
00:09:35.963 --> 00:09:38.099
I think it was regarding footprints if I'm correct,

166
00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:39.666
correct me on that,

167
00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:43.567
would have put human beings way further back within the

168
00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:47.712
historical scope than what he adheres to himself publicly.

169
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.477
But, it was just a piece of evidence

170
00:09:49.477 --> 00:09:52.716
before it was spun into anything larger.

171
00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:57.360
<v ->Yes, if we're talking about footprints evidence</v>

172
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.158
and Leakey, we're probably talking about

173
00:10:00.158 --> 00:10:04.129
his mother, Mary Leakey.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

174
00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:06.523
<v ->Richard Leakey is part of a</v>

175
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.066
prominent family in archaeology.

176
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:15.066
His father, Lewis Leakey, was a prominent archaeologist

177
00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:17.276
early in the 20th century.

178
00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:22.276
His mother, Mary Leakey, was a prominent archaeologist.

179
00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.680
His wife, Meave Leakey, is a prominent archaeologist.

180
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.185
He himself is a prominent archaeologist.

181
00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:36.185
In 1979, Mary Leakey found dozens of footprints

182
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.592
at a place called Laetoli

183
00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:42.632
in the country of Tanzania in east Africa.

184
00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:45.465
In her original report which was published

185
00:10:45.465 --> 00:10:48.437
in National Geographic Magazine, she said,

186
00:10:48.437 --> 00:10:52.141
"These footprints are indistinguishable

187
00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:55.473
"from modern human footprints,"

188
00:10:55.473 --> 00:11:00.473
but they're found in layers of solidified volcanic ash

189
00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:04.819
that are 3,700,000 years old.

190
00:11:04.819 --> 00:11:08.244
Now, Mary Leakey, being an evolutionist

191
00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:12.424
didn't believe that human beings like us

192
00:11:12.424 --> 00:11:17.424
were present 3,700,000 years ago to make those footprints.

193
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.901
How did she explain the footprints?

194
00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:23.267
She proposed, well there must of been some variety

195
00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:26.611
of ape man existing at that time

196
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:31.611
who had feet exactly like modern human feet.

197
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.645
That's an interesting idea,

198
00:11:34.645 --> 00:11:39.645
but there isn't any physical evidence to support it.

199
00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:42.644
We have the skeletons of the ape men

200
00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:44.781
who existed at the time.

201
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:48.031
They're called Australopithecus.

202
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:52.954
The foot of Australopithecus is not exactly like that of a

203
00:11:52.954 --> 00:11:55.067
modern human being, it tends to resemble

204
00:11:55.067 --> 00:11:56.693
the foot of a chimpanzee.

205
00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:59.676
For example, it has very long toes,

206
00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:01.940
sort of like short human fingers,

207
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.377
it has an opposable first toe,

208
00:12:05.377 --> 00:12:09.220
that means the first toe can move out to the side

209
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.739
like a human thumb can.

210
00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:14.491
Mostly our feet aren't like that.

211
00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:15.721
<v Regina>Right, very distinguishable</v>

212
00:12:15.721 --> 00:12:18.717
from a human footprint.

213
00:12:18.717 --> 00:12:21.526
<v ->Actually, the only creature known to science today</v>

214
00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:25.834
that has a foot exactly like a modern human foot

215
00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:28.806
is a human being like ourselves.

216
00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:33.806
To me, Mary Leakey found evidence that humans like ourselves

217
00:12:33.972 --> 00:12:38.972
were walking around in east Africa 3,700,000 years ago.

218
00:12:40.381 --> 00:12:41.783
We have to keep in mind that according

219
00:12:41.783 --> 00:12:44.151
to the current theories,

220
00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:49.151
most scientists believe that the first human beings like us

221
00:12:49.655 --> 00:12:54.655
only came into existence 100 or 200 thousand years ago.

222
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.400
This is an example of what I call knowledge filtering.

223
00:13:01.497 --> 00:13:04.074
Scientists are confronted with evidence

224
00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:05.641
for extreme human antiquity,

225
00:13:05.641 --> 00:13:08.277
but to explain it away, to make it fit their theories,

226
00:13:08.277 --> 00:13:13.062
they invent imaginary ape men with feet exactly like

227
00:13:13.062 --> 00:13:16.287
modern human feet and that's accepted as science.

228
00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:18.217
<v Regina>Yet, they can easily accept the holes</v>

229
00:13:18.217 --> 00:13:21.991
in the science called, i.e. the missing link, for example.

230
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:24.498
Easy to accept that, but not to actually look at

231
00:13:24.498 --> 00:13:27.122
the existing evidence to take it a step further,

232
00:13:27.122 --> 00:13:29.235
which you have done.

233
00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:33.032
Before we go off onto, there are many avenues

234
00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:36.367
we can take here, but just to kind of wrap this filtration

235
00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:41.010
portion of science up, in terms of your understanding of it,

236
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.949
I understand the funding part.

237
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:45.886
If you have a reputation, a foundation, a university,

238
00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:48.673
a name, you're reliant on a certain amount of funding,

239
00:13:48.673 --> 00:13:50.356
you want to kind of stick with your story

240
00:13:50.356 --> 00:13:53.154
to be able to perpetuate the funding.

241
00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:55.511
Is there more to it than that?

242
00:13:55.511 --> 00:14:00.511
It can't just be about funding and reputation and ego.

243
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:04.161
<v ->There are several things that I think are involved.</v>

244
00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:06.564
One is, it is just human nature.

245
00:14:06.564 --> 00:14:09.606
For example, if I love somebody and somebody tells me

246
00:14:09.606 --> 00:14:11.405
something bad about the person I love,

247
00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:12.903
I don't wanna believe it.

248
00:14:12.903 --> 00:14:16.978
I may even become angry at the person who tells me.

249
00:14:16.978 --> 00:14:20.786
Today, many scientists are very much in love

250
00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:22.853
with the theory of evolution.

251
00:14:22.853 --> 00:14:24.954
They just absolutely love it.

252
00:14:24.954 --> 00:14:27.717
Last year, well, a couple years ago

253
00:14:27.717 --> 00:14:31.096
was Darwin's 200th anniversary

254
00:14:31.096 --> 00:14:34.695
and scientists were holding 200th anniversary celebrations

255
00:14:34.695 --> 00:14:36.727
of Darwin's birth all over the world

256
00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:40.430
because they love the man and his theory.

257
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.843
When they hear something that contradicts it

258
00:14:43.843 --> 00:14:46.711
it sets them on edge.

259
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:50.148
They don't want to believe that, that there could be

260
00:14:50.148 --> 00:14:52.420
something wrong with the theory that they've

261
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.175
invested so much of their

262
00:14:55.175 --> 00:14:56.666
own self into.
<v Regina>It's basic</v>

263
00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:58.171
resistance, human resistance

264
00:14:58.171 --> 00:15:01.591
on one level?
<v ->Another factor is</v>

265
00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:06.126
the process of knowledge filtration has been so effective

266
00:15:06.126 --> 00:15:11.126
that the supporters of the Darwinian theory of evolution

267
00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:16.006
now have a government enforced monopoly

268
00:15:16.006 --> 00:15:20.046
in the education system in most countries in the world,

269
00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:25.046
including the United States, that means only their ideas

270
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:30.286
can be taught to the new generation of scientists

271
00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:35.286
that is being educated in the high schools and universities.

272
00:15:35.488 --> 00:15:40.488
That means they're taught to see anything that contradicts

273
00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:43.835
or opposes the Darwinian theory of evolution

274
00:15:43.835 --> 00:15:46.471
is somehow illegitimate.

275
00:15:46.471 --> 00:15:50.128
It's effectively marginalized.

276
00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:53.576
That's another feature of how this

277
00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:55.701
knowledge filtering process works.

278
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:59.276
If you can arrange things so that all other ideas

279
00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:02.771
are excluded from the training of a new generation

280
00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:06.639
of scientists, you're ensuring that your ideas

281
00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:10.596
are perpetuated and that automatically,

282
00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:15.159
these scientists in training who are being educated

283
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:18.236
and moving into the scientific profession, are trained

284
00:16:18.236 --> 00:16:23.236
to regard anything that contradicts the Darwinian theory

285
00:16:23.472 --> 00:16:27.907
of evolution as illegitimate somehow or other.

286
00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:32.516
That's why I think one important thing that needs to be done

287
00:16:32.516 --> 00:16:36.080
is to allow alternatives to the

288
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.080
Darwinian theory of evolution into the official curriculum,

289
00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:46.688
so that students are free to make up their own minds

290
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.768
about these things.

291
00:16:49.768 --> 00:16:52.230
I think that's something that needs to be done.

292
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:57.230
Then there's one further point about this whole thing

293
00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.509
of knowledge filtering.

294
00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:01.680
It has something to do with power.

295
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.874
There are different sorts of power in the world.

296
00:17:03.874 --> 00:17:08.019
There's military power, there's economic power,

297
00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:10.814
there is political power, there's also

298
00:17:10.814 --> 00:17:13.717
intellectual power, which is a very subtle power,

299
00:17:13.717 --> 00:17:15.795
but a very real one.

300
00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:20.795
Those that possess this power are able to set a direction

301
00:17:21.054 --> 00:17:24.467
for our whole society, our whole worldwide

302
00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:27.532
human civilization, and it works like this.

303
00:17:27.532 --> 00:17:31.805
The goals that we set for ourselves individually

304
00:17:31.805 --> 00:17:35.543
and collectively depend on our sense of self,

305
00:17:35.543 --> 00:17:36.556
our sense of identity.

306
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.544
Who am I? Where did I come from?

307
00:17:38.544 --> 00:17:42.383
If I think I'm an American man, then I behave like that

308
00:17:42.383 --> 00:17:45.518
because that's my identity and that will

309
00:17:45.518 --> 00:17:49.692
have some influence on the goals that I set for myself,

310
00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:53.374
the values that I adopt.

311
00:17:53.374 --> 00:17:58.374
Through the monopoly they now have in the education system,

312
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.667
the supporters of the Darwinian theory of evolution

313
00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:04.547
are able to dictate to people

314
00:18:04.547 --> 00:18:06.904
the answers to these important questions.

315
00:18:06.904 --> 00:18:08.959
Who am I and where did I come from?

316
00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:12.260
<v Regina>In other words, don't look any further, no need.</v>

317
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.618
<v ->This has some very powerful effects because</v>

318
00:18:14.618 --> 00:18:17.881
the answers their giving are very materialistic.

319
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:21.294
They're saying basically, you're an evolved ape.

320
00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:22.954
You're another type of animal.

321
00:18:22.954 --> 00:18:25.299
You're a chemical machine.

322
00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:27.064
This is what you are.

323
00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.933
<v Regina>You're a mutation.</v>

324
00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:33.206
<v ->As Richard Dawkins said, "We are survival machines,</v>

325
00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:35.876
"robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve

326
00:18:35.876 --> 00:18:38.175
"the selfish molecules known as genes."

327
00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:41.902
These are the ideas that are being promoted.

328
00:18:41.902 --> 00:18:46.902
If you are able to define people's identity in that way,

329
00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.390
in a very materialistic way,

330
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.390
It's natural that the goals that they will set individually

331
00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:57.354
and collectively will tend to be very materialistic.

332
00:18:57.354 --> 00:19:00.628
They'll tend to think that to produce and consume

333
00:19:00.628 --> 00:19:03.194
more and more material things

334
00:19:03.194 --> 00:19:06.965
is the main purpose of human life.

335
00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:11.004
They're taught, not only are they molecular machines,

336
00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:13.547
molecular robots, they're molecular robots

337
00:19:13.547 --> 00:19:17.610
in competition with each other for survival.

338
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.269
What you get out of this

339
00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:25.269
is a society with an imbalance in its values,

340
00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:31.159
where the materialistic values and the values

341
00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:36.159
that support competition are dominant in society.

342
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.402
I think this is one of the root causes

343
00:19:39.402 --> 00:19:42.433
of our environmental crisis.

344
00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:46.171
We are producing and consuming too much.

345
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:51.105
It's also at the root at the intense levels of conlflict

346
00:19:51.105 --> 00:19:53.984
that we see in the world today.

347
00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.214
We see conflict among individuals,

348
00:19:56.214 --> 00:20:00.022
conflict among classes, conflict among nations,

349
00:20:00.022 --> 00:20:02.820
conflict among religions even.

350
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.188
It's not that there wasn't any conflict

351
00:20:05.188 --> 00:20:07.858
before the Darwinian theory of evolution,

352
00:20:07.858 --> 00:20:11.504
but I think this particular theory

353
00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:14.964
and the way that it's being promoted

354
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.841
in a monopoly way in the education system is not

355
00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:22.034
doing anything to really help make things that much better.

356
00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:24.445
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

357
00:20:24.445 --> 00:20:28.916
<v ->If we had different answers to the questions</v>

358
00:20:28.916 --> 00:20:31.888
who am I and where did I come from,

359
00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:35.987
then that might result in some change in values,

360
00:20:35.987 --> 00:20:39.261
some change in goals, some change in the direction

361
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:42.198
that our worldwide human civilization is taking

362
00:20:42.198 --> 00:20:45.066
and the important thing to realize is that

363
00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:47.399
most of the alternatives involve something

364
00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:49.303
non-material or spiritual,

365
00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:51.053
and they want to avoid that

366
00:20:51.053 --> 00:20:53.076
like anything.
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

367
00:20:53.076 --> 00:20:54.412
This is the point in the conversation,

368
00:20:54.412 --> 00:20:57.546
this is why I wanted to talk to you specifically,

369
00:20:57.546 --> 00:21:02.252
because you understand the depth of this problem.

370
00:21:02.252 --> 00:21:06.483
As you said, it's not just the materialistic aspect

371
00:21:06.483 --> 00:21:11.348
of this programming, it's highly predictable.

372
00:21:11.348 --> 00:21:14.993
Being programmed with this belief of what we are,

373
00:21:14.993 --> 00:21:17.931
it's advantageous to anyone who chooses to

374
00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:21.832
control impressions or human movement and behavior

375
00:21:21.832 --> 00:21:24.978
know what a very predictable response would be.

376
00:21:24.978 --> 00:21:28.078
<v ->Yes.</v>

377
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.980
<v Regina>And what you're talking about goes beyond that.</v>

378
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.980
<v ->Yes, because there's a lot at stake.</v>

379
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.024
There are a lot of forces in society

380
00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:44.262
that would like to see everybody keeping their nose

381
00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:49.262
to the grindstone and being quiet producers and consumers

382
00:21:49.568 --> 00:21:53.306
of material products, financial products,

383
00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:55.593
entertainment products.

384
00:21:55.593 --> 00:21:59.076
If everybody's doing that,

385
00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:02.676
it's in the interest of a lot of groups

386
00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:04.948
in our human society today

387
00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:09.185
because that process generates huge amounts of wealth.

388
00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:12.552
Some of the wealth flows into the pockets

389
00:22:12.552 --> 00:22:17.552
of scientists who are helping invent consumer products,

390
00:22:18.055 --> 00:22:20.935
weapons, pharmaceuticals.

391
00:22:20.935 --> 00:22:23.802
They're organized like that.

392
00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:25.602
A century or two ago, most scientists

393
00:22:25.602 --> 00:22:28.435
were working individually or in small groups,

394
00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:31.070
now they're working in huge labs.

395
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.510
Hundreds of them working together to

396
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.510
produce consumer products, pharmaceuticals, weapons.

397
00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:44.953
There are corporate interests

398
00:22:44.953 --> 00:22:48.320
that want to see this continue.

399
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.663
The governments that tax all this economic activity,

400
00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:54.531
they want to see this continue.

401
00:22:54.531 --> 00:22:56.159
We're complicit ourselves.

402
00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:58.294
<v Regina>Yes, we are.</v>

403
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.588
We also are part of--
<v Regina>We're playing our</v>

404
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:01.633
part of the program well.

405
00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:05.012
<v ->We're playing our part in the program as well.</v>

406
00:23:05.012 --> 00:23:08.739
If this gets disturbed in the least way

407
00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:13.046
so that the process of material production and consumption

408
00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:16.204
gets disturbed, that means economic activity

409
00:23:16.204 --> 00:23:17.690
goes down a little bit,

410
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.385
and when that happens,

411
00:23:19.385 --> 00:23:23.228
alarm bells go off all over the world among the

412
00:23:23.228 --> 00:23:27.514
financial elites, political elites, cultural elites.

413
00:23:30.024 --> 00:23:34.251
One thing that keeps this whole

414
00:23:34.251 --> 00:23:37.511
engine going is

415
00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:41.906
the concept of the self that's being dictated to people.

416
00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:43.543
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

417
00:23:43.543 --> 00:23:46.944
<v ->It's a very materialistic concept of self.</v>

418
00:23:46.944 --> 00:23:50.648
They would say, okay, if you want to believe

419
00:23:50.648 --> 00:23:53.992
in God and the soul privately, you can do that

420
00:23:53.992 --> 00:23:58.480
if it makes you feel good, but this can have no part

421
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.359
in the way that we organize society,

422
00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:04.867
the way that we organize our education system,

423
00:24:04.867 --> 00:24:06.968
the way that we set up our politics,

424
00:24:06.968 --> 00:24:09.464
the way that we set up our culture.

425
00:24:09.464 --> 00:24:13.911
You can do those things on your own

426
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:16.941
but it's not part of the real life.

427
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:19.182
<v Regina>Right. That's your little spiritual belief</v>

428
00:24:19.182 --> 00:24:22.421
and it's between you and you.

429
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:24.678
<v ->That's all.</v>

430
00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:28.592
That's what I think is really at stake.

431
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:30.390
<v Regina>That's what's at stake, yes.</v>

432
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.223
<v ->That's what's really at stake here.</v>

433
00:24:33.223 --> 00:24:37.728
I think that's why there's so much resistance

434
00:24:37.728 --> 00:24:41.946
to any challenge to

435
00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:45.066
the Darwinian theory of evolution.

436
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:48.339
I think it occupies a central role

437
00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:52.516
in our modern worldwide human civilization,

438
00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:55.813
and a lot depends on keeping it in place.

439
00:24:55.813 --> 00:25:00.353
Which I think explains the huge level of resistance

440
00:25:00.353 --> 00:25:05.032
to, for example, including any mention of alternatives

441
00:25:05.032 --> 00:25:07.226
to the Darwinian theory of evolution

442
00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:09.269
in the education system.

443
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:12.439
Scientists like to talk a lot about Galileo.

444
00:25:12.439 --> 00:25:14.471
They say, okay, a few hundred years ago

445
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:17.071
there was this scientist named Galileo

446
00:25:17.071 --> 00:25:20.903
who had some different ideas about the solar system,

447
00:25:20.903 --> 00:25:23.712
but because the church opposed his ideas,

448
00:25:23.712 --> 00:25:26.243
and the church had influence with government,

449
00:25:26.243 --> 00:25:29.378
the church was able to have him put under house arrest,

450
00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:34.378
and have his ideas effectively suppressed for sometime.

451
00:25:34.393 --> 00:25:36.622
They bring that up.

452
00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:39.130
<v Regina>Yeah, like a faux poster boy for progress.</v>

453
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:44.061
<v ->Right, and now it's the scientists who support the</v>

454
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:47.405
theory of evolution who have the influence from government

455
00:25:47.405 --> 00:25:48.120
and they're doing the

456
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.025
exact same thing.
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

457
00:25:49.025 --> 00:25:51.695
Exact same thing.
<v ->That they criticize</v>

458
00:25:51.695 --> 00:25:54.944
the church for having done with Galileo.

459
00:25:54.944 --> 00:25:58.183
In other words, they're gonna try to maintain

460
00:25:58.183 --> 00:26:00.749
a government enforced monopoly

461
00:26:00.749 --> 00:26:05.149
in the public-tax supported education system,

462
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:07.424
and they've done it very effectively.

463
00:26:07.424 --> 00:26:11.290
I'm not even saying that alternative ideas should be given

464
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.630
equal time or that the Darwinian theory of evolution

465
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.731
should be thrown out of the education system.

466
00:26:17.731 --> 00:26:19.600
I believe in academic freedom.

467
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.600
I believe in the right of anyone to make up their own mind

468
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:26.706
about these questions.

469
00:26:26.706 --> 00:26:29.411
If someone, a scientist or an ordinary person,

470
00:26:29.411 --> 00:26:33.950
honestly believes that the Darwinian theory of evolution

471
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.783
is the best explanation for the origin of life,

472
00:26:36.783 --> 00:26:39.248
the origin of species,

473
00:26:39.248 --> 00:26:43.998
I'm happy to accept that.

474
00:26:43.998 --> 00:26:47.000
What I don't accept is their right to use the government

475
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.228
to exclude every other idea from

476
00:26:50.228 --> 00:26:52.805
the public-tax supported education system.

477
00:26:52.805 --> 00:26:54.570
I don't think they have a right to do that.

478
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.509
I don't think they have a right to hijack

479
00:26:56.509 --> 00:26:58.993
the entire education system

480
00:26:58.993 --> 00:27:02.941
to impose their ideas on everyone.

481
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:04.415
<v Regina>Especially, as you say, when you put it</v>

482
00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:07.039
in the context of what's at stake here.

483
00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:09.848
<v ->Yes.</v>

484
00:27:09.848 --> 00:27:14.848
I would say the proper solution is to allow alternatives

485
00:27:15.294 --> 00:27:18.765
to the Darwinian theory of evolution

486
00:27:18.765 --> 00:27:23.765
as part of the official science curriculum.

487
00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:25.429
I would say, okay, let's admit today

488
00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:28.375
most scientist accept the Darwinian theory of evolution.

489
00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:31.867
Okay, give them most of the pages in the Biology text book,

490
00:27:31.867 --> 00:27:35.640
but in some percentage of those textbook pages,

491
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.914
let's say 5%, there should be some mention,

492
00:27:38.914 --> 00:27:43.221
well there are other scientists who don't accept that theory

493
00:27:43.221 --> 00:27:46.960
who accept alternative theories that may involve

494
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.348
non-material principles or some kind of intelligence

495
00:27:51.348 --> 00:27:55.680
in the cosmos that's designing things.

496
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.501
That should be there.

497
00:27:57.501 --> 00:28:02.501
In a democratic society that values academic freedom,

498
00:28:03.663 --> 00:28:06.438
I think that is the proper solution.

499
00:28:06.438 --> 00:28:10.478
Not to give the majority group an absolute monopoly

500
00:28:10.478 --> 00:28:12.475
in the education system.

501
00:28:12.475 --> 00:28:15.853
I think if people wanna set up their own private schools

502
00:28:15.853 --> 00:28:19.348
and teach only their ideas, that's another question.

503
00:28:19.348 --> 00:28:22.216
But, if you're taking tax money from all the people,

504
00:28:22.216 --> 00:28:25.780
I think there's some obligation on the part of government

505
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.528
to ensure that the diversity that's actually there

506
00:28:30.528 --> 00:28:34.267
in the scientific community and in the general public

507
00:28:34.267 --> 00:28:36.798
is recognized.

508
00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:41.709
For example, we wouldn't think we should allow,

509
00:28:41.709 --> 00:28:45.981
okay, say maybe there's some racial group in the country

510
00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:47.282
that has a majority.

511
00:28:47.282 --> 00:28:51.891
We wouldn't allow them to pose their values on everyone.

512
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:56.430
We would respect there's some diversity.

513
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.202
In the intellectual field, I don't think we should

514
00:28:59.202 --> 00:29:03.266
allow one group, even if it's the majority

515
00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:05.704
to have a monopoly.

516
00:29:05.704 --> 00:29:07.027
<v Regina>To monopolize our perception</v>

517
00:29:07.027 --> 00:29:08.734
of what we are as humans.

518
00:29:08.734 --> 00:29:10.104
<v ->That's not fair.</v>

519
00:29:10.104 --> 00:29:12.848
<v Regina>It's so not fair.</v>

520
00:29:12.848 --> 00:29:17.848
<v ->Life can be unfair, but it's not right.</v>

521
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:20.518
<v Regina>It's not morally or ethically correct</v>

522
00:29:20.518 --> 00:29:24.908
to continue down that road, in my opinion.

523
00:29:24.908 --> 00:29:26.749
First of all, for the sake of time,

524
00:29:26.749 --> 00:29:29.222
because we could probably spend the rest of the afternoon

525
00:29:29.222 --> 00:29:32.833
talking here, first of all, people need to read the book

526
00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:35.125
so they can get into the understanding of some of the

527
00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:39.932
scientific supports for the extreme antiquity

528
00:29:39.932 --> 00:29:42.032
of the human species.

529
00:29:42.032 --> 00:29:46.059
So you don't have to regurgitate that as you have had to

530
00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:48.311
with many people over the last 20 or 30 years

531
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:50.517
of doing these interviews, what I'd like to do

532
00:29:50.517 --> 00:29:54.116
is now go to your own, the development of your own

533
00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:57.715
understanding of the species and what a human being is

534
00:29:57.715 --> 00:30:01.499
and go into that.

535
00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:05.328
<v ->In my book, Forbidden Archaeology, I presented</v>

536
00:30:05.328 --> 00:30:08.231
archaeological evidence that contradicts

537
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:12.770
the currently dominant evolutionary theory of human origins.

538
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.406
Gave evidence showing humans had existed

539
00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:17.704
for millions and millions of years

540
00:30:17.704 --> 00:30:22.012
alongside our so-called ape man ancestors,

541
00:30:22.012 --> 00:30:23.881
and primitive apes and monkeys.

542
00:30:23.881 --> 00:30:26.307
Then after reading that book,

543
00:30:26.307 --> 00:30:30.313
people began to ask me, well, if you've got evidence

544
00:30:30.313 --> 00:30:34.074
that contradicts the Darwinian theory of evolution,

545
00:30:34.074 --> 00:30:37.023
then what are you proposing to replace it?

546
00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:41.891
Do you have any alternative ideas about

547
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:44.491
where we came from?

548
00:30:44.491 --> 00:30:48.595
To answer that question, which is a legitimate one,

549
00:30:48.595 --> 00:30:52.168
I wrote another book called Human Devolution:

550
00:30:52.168 --> 00:30:55.813
A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory.

551
00:30:55.813 --> 00:31:00.713
In that book I propose that before we even ask the question

552
00:31:00.713 --> 00:31:03.221
where did human beings come from,

553
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:05.357
we should first of all ask the question,

554
00:31:05.357 --> 00:31:07.656
what is a human being?

555
00:31:07.656 --> 00:31:12.555
Today, many scientists are going to say that

556
00:31:12.555 --> 00:31:14.993
a human being, or any other living thing,

557
00:31:14.993 --> 00:31:19.602
is just a complex organization of molecules.

558
00:31:19.602 --> 00:31:22.075
That's what we are.

559
00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:24.978
We're molecular machines.

560
00:31:24.978 --> 00:31:29.842
If you organize these molecules in a sufficiently complex

561
00:31:29.842 --> 00:31:34.842
way in the brain, then we get mind and consciousness,

562
00:31:35.717 --> 00:31:39.490
but only temporarily, and only in association

563
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.324
with those chemicals in the brain.

564
00:31:41.324 --> 00:31:44.262
When those chemicals are disorganized,

565
00:31:44.262 --> 00:31:48.325
there's no more consciousness, no more mind,

566
00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:50.833
no more love, none of that.

567
00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:55.833
Under that view, it is matter that is primary.

568
00:31:56.743 --> 00:32:00.411
It is matter that defines our existence as human beings.

569
00:32:00.411 --> 00:32:05.411
It is matter that determines our goals and our values.

570
00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.278
I'm proposing something different.

571
00:32:09.278 --> 00:32:13.713
That if we look carefully at all of the evidence,

572
00:32:13.713 --> 00:32:18.713
we'll see that a human being is not just a combination

573
00:32:19.762 --> 00:32:21.898
of the chemical elements.

574
00:32:21.898 --> 00:32:26.898
There is a subtle mind element with some very unusual powers

575
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.942
that's associated with a human organism.

576
00:32:30.942 --> 00:32:35.273
Beyond that, there is a conscious self that can exist

577
00:32:35.273 --> 00:32:37.943
apart from matter, apart from the body,

578
00:32:37.943 --> 00:32:42.088
apart from the brain.

579
00:32:42.088 --> 00:32:46.290
When I speak of mind and consciousness,

580
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:50.249
I don't mean temporary bi-products of bioelectrical

581
00:32:50.249 --> 00:32:53.721
activity in the brain, I mean real things

582
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:58.721
with their own independent existence.

583
00:32:59.804 --> 00:33:04.804
What I'm proposing is that the real essence of a human being

584
00:33:05.342 --> 00:33:10.114
is the conscious self, and that conscious self

585
00:33:10.114 --> 00:33:13.609
is not produced by matter.

586
00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:17.881
It has its own independent existence.

587
00:33:17.881 --> 00:33:22.223
It can become covered by matter,

588
00:33:22.223 --> 00:33:27.223
but it is not produced by matter.

589
00:33:27.517 --> 00:33:32.517
My idea is a consciousness based conception

590
00:33:32.637 --> 00:33:37.637
of what a human being is, not a matter based conception.

591
00:33:38.175 --> 00:33:41.577
I'm proposing that as conscious beings,

592
00:33:41.577 --> 00:33:44.514
we don't evolve up from matter,

593
00:33:44.514 --> 00:33:47.951
as many scientists now believe,

594
00:33:47.951 --> 00:33:52.491
rather we devolve, or come down from a level

595
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:57.053
of pure consciousness.

596
00:33:57.053 --> 00:34:00.792
When that happens, the conscious self can become

597
00:34:00.792 --> 00:34:04.600
covered by matter temporarily,

598
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.164
but it's a process that can be reversed.

599
00:34:08.164 --> 00:34:10.971
I call the process devolution.

600
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:14.407
We devolve from the level of pure consciousness.

601
00:34:14.407 --> 00:34:17.319
We don't evolve up from matter.

602
00:34:17.319 --> 00:34:21.417
That devolution is a process that can be reversed.

603
00:34:21.417 --> 00:34:25.550
Consciousness can be restored to its original pure state,

604
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.126
and that is the real purpose of human life.

605
00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:34.126
We're actually meant to satisfy our material necessities

606
00:34:34.362 --> 00:34:38.635
in the most simple, natural, and efficient way possible

607
00:34:38.635 --> 00:34:42.199
and put most of our human energy into developing

608
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.834
the resource of consciousness.

609
00:34:44.834 --> 00:34:48.608
If we do that, then we realize, yes, I am a being

610
00:34:48.608 --> 00:34:51.208
of pure consciousness, I have material needs,

611
00:34:51.208 --> 00:34:56.208
but I also have needs related to my conscious essence.

612
00:34:56.668 --> 00:35:00.322
We'll learn how to balance those needs appropriately

613
00:35:00.322 --> 00:35:04.722
so that we won't be over producing and over consuming

614
00:35:04.722 --> 00:35:07.494
material things in an unsustainable way,

615
00:35:07.494 --> 00:35:10.536
which as I said is the actual root

616
00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:12.939
of our environmental crisis.

617
00:35:12.939 --> 00:35:15.923
We'll learn to live with voluntary simplicity.

618
00:35:15.923 --> 00:35:19.777
Learn to live within our means on this planet.

619
00:35:19.777 --> 00:35:24.777
Not over exploiting the earth's resources.

620
00:35:24.923 --> 00:35:28.549
As beings of pure consciousness, we'll also recognize

621
00:35:28.549 --> 00:35:33.123
that others are also beings of pure consciousness.

622
00:35:33.123 --> 00:35:34.760
We're all in this together.

623
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.754
We're all part of the same conscious family.

624
00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:42.399
We're not meat to be fighting with each other

625
00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:47.399
on the basis of superficial externalities.

626
00:35:49.274 --> 00:35:52.300
It would be a different sort of world

627
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.575
that we'd be living in.

628
00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:57.675
<v Regina>The antithesis of what has been created.</v>

629
00:35:57.675 --> 00:36:02.675
<v ->Yes, and I think this is what's actually at stake.</v>

630
00:36:04.293 --> 00:36:07.154
Sometimes people ask me, well what difference does it make

631
00:36:07.154 --> 00:36:12.154
if human beings existed millions of years ago or not?

632
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:15.034
This is a very important question.

633
00:36:15.034 --> 00:36:18.204
It's not just something for a few scientists

634
00:36:18.204 --> 00:36:21.999
and philosophers to argue about in their ivory towers.

635
00:36:21.999 --> 00:36:26.945
These are questions that influence the lives of all of us.

636
00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:29.244
Our sense of identity is gonna determine

637
00:36:29.244 --> 00:36:31.636
the direction that we take.

638
00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:35.614
If we don't have a proper understanding of who we are,

639
00:36:35.614 --> 00:36:38.549
and where we are, then we're not gonna be able

640
00:36:38.549 --> 00:36:42.624
to act in our own best self-interest.

641
00:36:42.624 --> 00:36:46.525
In order to do that, first you have to understand

642
00:36:46.525 --> 00:36:51.401
who you are and today, we're being given the wrong answers

643
00:36:51.401 --> 00:36:56.033
and therefore, it's not a surprise that our world

644
00:36:56.033 --> 00:36:58.367
is in such a mess.

645
00:36:58.367 --> 00:37:01.838
The first step towards changing all that

646
00:37:01.838 --> 00:37:06.838
has to be a new concept of self.

647
00:37:07.144 --> 00:37:11.410
<v Regina>To know thy self, truly know thy self.</v>

648
00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:14.119
I was listening to you in another interview

649
00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:19.119
speaking about the origins or materializaion of the physical

650
00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:23.081
vehicle, so to speak, as coming from this state of

651
00:37:23.081 --> 00:37:25.102
pure consciousness.

652
00:37:25.102 --> 00:37:28.756
I think you referred to it as a parallel reality

653
00:37:28.756 --> 00:37:31.301
of some kind that exists.

654
00:37:31.301 --> 00:37:36.301
How do you perceive the coming into the material form

655
00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:41.375
and the objective of having done this

656
00:37:41.878 --> 00:37:46.046
to create this species.

657
00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:49.181
<v ->Originally, we all belong on the level</v>

658
00:37:49.181 --> 00:37:53.894
of pure consciousness where we exist in loving harmony

659
00:37:53.894 --> 00:37:57.389
with all other conscious beings,

660
00:37:57.389 --> 00:38:01.336
and with the source of all conscious beings.

661
00:38:01.336 --> 00:38:05.342
If we become selfish or egotistical,

662
00:38:05.342 --> 00:38:10.342
we can no longer exist in that harmonious state,

663
00:38:12.286 --> 00:38:17.286
then we need some other place where we can act out

664
00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:20.850
our selfish desires, because it can't be done

665
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.893
on that level of pure consciousness.

666
00:38:22.893 --> 00:38:27.893
There the ruling principle is love, harmony.

667
00:38:28.292 --> 00:38:33.064
If we become egotistical, we need another place,

668
00:38:33.064 --> 00:38:37.533
and that is this level of reality.

669
00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:40.471
When we come to this level of reality,

670
00:38:40.471 --> 00:38:42.340
the material level of reality,

671
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.777
we need vehicles that will allow us to function here.

672
00:38:45.777 --> 00:38:49.152
For example, as human beings, we're normally meant

673
00:38:49.152 --> 00:38:50.313
to live on the land.

674
00:38:50.313 --> 00:38:51.556
We walk around on the land.

675
00:38:51.556 --> 00:38:54.017
We interact with each other on the land.

676
00:38:54.017 --> 00:38:59.017
If we want to live under the water in an alien element,

677
00:38:59.056 --> 00:39:01.900
then we're going to need some vehicle

678
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.466
that will allow us to function under the water.

679
00:39:04.466 --> 00:39:07.237
We need a diving suit, we need a submarine,

680
00:39:07.237 --> 00:39:12.237
we need some vehicles that will allow us to function there.

681
00:39:13.074 --> 00:39:15.408
Where do those vehicles come from?

682
00:39:15.408 --> 00:39:18.798
They come from engineers who understand that

683
00:39:18.798 --> 00:39:22.583
if a human being is going to live under the water

684
00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:25.277
in an alien element, it's going to need a vehicle

685
00:39:25.277 --> 00:39:29.479
that will allow such a human being to function there,

686
00:39:29.479 --> 00:39:33.380
so these vehicles are designed and built.

687
00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.631
In the same way, when a conscious self

688
00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:40.172
comes into the world of matter,

689
00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:45.172
it needs a vehicle made of matter in which it can function

690
00:39:45.524 --> 00:39:47.243
on this level of reality,

691
00:39:47.243 --> 00:39:50.308
and where do those vehicles come from?

692
00:39:50.308 --> 00:39:51.725
The way I see it,

693
00:39:51.725 --> 00:39:55.086
there's a higher intelligence in the cosmos that

694
00:39:55.086 --> 00:40:00.086
designs and builds those vehicles.

695
00:40:01.106 --> 00:40:04.890
There's a difference, however, between the vehicles

696
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.491
that are built by that higher intelligence

697
00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:12.065
and the kinds of vehicles that human engineers might make.

698
00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:16.941
The difference is that these vehicles, these human vehicles

699
00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:21.941
or fish vehicles or other animal vehicles,

700
00:40:22.905 --> 00:40:24.577
or bird vehicles,

701
00:40:24.577 --> 00:40:27.453
once the original ones are produced,

702
00:40:27.453 --> 00:40:32.453
they can go on to reproduce themselves.

703
00:40:32.655 --> 00:40:34.756
The kinds of machines and vehicles

704
00:40:34.756 --> 00:40:38.785
that our human engineers build can't do that.

705
00:40:38.785 --> 00:40:41.025
You can't put two cars together in the garage

706
00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:44.032
and come back sometime later and have--

707
00:40:44.032 --> 00:40:47.068
<v Regina>A baby car.</v>
<v ->A baby car.</v>

708
00:40:47.068 --> 00:40:50.975
That's where I think these vehicles come from,

709
00:40:50.975 --> 00:40:55.248
but really, in the state of pure consciousness,

710
00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:57.686
there's no need for them.

711
00:40:57.686 --> 00:41:00.054
Just like if you're on the land,

712
00:41:00.054 --> 00:41:03.607
you don't need a submarine to get around in.

713
00:41:03.607 --> 00:41:05.842
<v Regina>This begs the question,</v>

714
00:41:05.842 --> 00:41:10.730
about the engineering of the vehicles, as you said,

715
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:14.245
from a higher form of consciousness intelligence,

716
00:41:14.245 --> 00:41:16.761
from a high form of consciousness intelligence,

717
00:41:16.761 --> 00:41:21.301
were there intermediaries who helped in the design

718
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:24.134
of the vehicles that may have been non-human?

719
00:41:24.134 --> 00:41:26.874
Now we get into the whole notion of other people's work

720
00:41:26.874 --> 00:41:29.347
and alien species that helped engineer vehicles

721
00:41:29.347 --> 00:41:31.483
for the human species and such.

722
00:41:31.483 --> 00:41:33.143
Where does your thinking come into this?

723
00:41:33.143 --> 00:41:34.919
<v ->I believe we're part of a whole</v>

724
00:41:34.919 --> 00:41:37.404
cosmic hierarchy of beings.

725
00:41:37.404 --> 00:41:41.653
We live in a multi-level cosmos.

726
00:41:41.653 --> 00:41:44.197
On one level,

727
00:41:44.197 --> 00:41:49.197
the cosmos is pure consciousness and

728
00:41:49.427 --> 00:41:54.006
it's inhabited by beings adapted to the conditions there.

729
00:41:54.006 --> 00:41:57.002
There's another level of the cosmos

730
00:41:57.002 --> 00:42:02.002
that's dominated by subtle mental energies,

731
00:42:02.835 --> 00:42:06.481
and it's inhabited by beings that are

732
00:42:06.481 --> 00:42:09.116
adapted to the conditions there.

733
00:42:09.116 --> 00:42:12.820
People have different names for such beings.

734
00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.328
They may call them astral beings,

735
00:42:15.328 --> 00:42:17.775
they may call them angels,

736
00:42:17.775 --> 00:42:22.775
or daevas, or extraterrestrials.

737
00:42:23.385 --> 00:42:27.565
There are different names that people have

738
00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:31.268
for these beings who exist on that more subtle

739
00:42:31.268 --> 00:42:35.769
material level of reality.

740
00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:39.078
Then there's the level of ordinary matter

741
00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:43.618
which is the level that we're now inhabiting.

742
00:42:43.618 --> 00:42:47.391
One of the principles of this cosmic hierarchy of beings

743
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:50.619
is that beings on the higher levels are able to

744
00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:55.619
influence those on the lower levels.

745
00:42:56.029 --> 00:43:01.029
One of the ways that they do that is by

746
00:43:02.356 --> 00:43:06.977
this process of producing bodies or vehicles

747
00:43:06.977 --> 00:43:10.716
for them to inhabit.

748
00:43:10.716 --> 00:43:13.653
So, yes, these intermediate beings that exist

749
00:43:13.653 --> 00:43:16.846
on that intermediate level of the cosmos

750
00:43:16.846 --> 00:43:20.094
do play a role

751
00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:23.554
in the designing and building

752
00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:26.760
of the vehicles that we call bodies

753
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.202
that conscious selves inhabit on this

754
00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:34.902
level of reality.

755
00:43:34.902 --> 00:43:39.902
People tend to want simple explanations.

756
00:43:40.042 --> 00:43:44.210
They prefer either a simple creation account,

757
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.847
that there's a god somewhere

758
00:43:45.847 --> 00:43:49.748
who created all these things instantaneously,

759
00:43:49.748 --> 00:43:53.626
or they prefer a simple evolutionary account,

760
00:43:53.626 --> 00:43:56.285
all the chemicals in the ocean got together

761
00:43:56.285 --> 00:43:58.189
and formed the first living thing

762
00:43:58.189 --> 00:44:03.135
and it evolved to produce all the other forms of life,

763
00:44:03.135 --> 00:44:07.825
or they prefer a simple extraterrestrial account

764
00:44:07.825 --> 00:44:12.039
that the ET's came and manipulated the genes

765
00:44:12.039 --> 00:44:16.045
of some ape man and produced human beings.

766
00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:18.611
People tend to want simple accounts.

767
00:44:18.611 --> 00:44:23.487
I think the actual picture may be a little more complex.

768
00:44:23.487 --> 00:44:27.454
It may involve elements of all three of these things.

769
00:44:27.454 --> 00:44:31.556
I think there is some over all guiding intelligence

770
00:44:31.556 --> 00:44:34.749
that's behind the whole process.

771
00:44:34.749 --> 00:44:39.749
I think it is also an extraterrestrial process

772
00:44:40.832 --> 00:44:44.571
in the sense that yes, there are life forms

773
00:44:44.571 --> 00:44:48.228
on other levels of reality, other dimensions of reality,

774
00:44:48.228 --> 00:44:52.245
that have something to do with our presence here.

775
00:44:52.245 --> 00:44:57.245
Exactly what it is, maybe we need to study that.

776
00:44:57.318 --> 00:45:02.318
There is a kind of evolutionary process that's involved,

777
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.359
but it's not the kind that Darwin talked about,

778
00:45:08.359 --> 00:45:11.599
which involves going from the more simple

779
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:13.967
to the more complex forms.

780
00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:17.903
I think the more complex forms are there

781
00:45:17.903 --> 00:45:20.445
in the beginning.

782
00:45:20.445 --> 00:45:22.315
<v Regina>You say humans have been here all along.</v>

783
00:45:22.315 --> 00:45:23.380
<v ->Yes.</v>

784
00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.645
<v Regina>Period.</v>

785
00:45:24.645 --> 00:45:26.375
This kind of cuts to the heart of what you're saying.

786
00:45:26.375 --> 00:45:27.478
<v ->Yes.</v>

787
00:45:27.478 --> 00:45:29.278
<v Regina>We've always been part of this earth experience</v>

788
00:45:29.278 --> 00:45:32.180
along with other species that we consider

789
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.560
to have been extinct well before we ever came here.

790
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.884
Not necessarily true.

791
00:45:35.884 --> 00:45:38.391
<v ->And we're not alone in the cosmos.</v>

792
00:45:38.391 --> 00:45:40.086
That's something.
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

793
00:45:40.086 --> 00:45:43.860
<v ->We're beginning to accept, even mainstream scientists</v>

794
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.832
are beginning to accept this and

795
00:45:46.832 --> 00:45:50.001
I think that's one of the reasons why

796
00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:53.403
there's so much interest among scientists,

797
00:45:53.403 --> 00:45:56.607
among astrophysicists, in trying to find

798
00:45:56.607 --> 00:46:01.607
other life supporting planets outside our solar system

799
00:46:02.354 --> 00:46:06.859
in this galaxy and other galaxies.

800
00:46:06.859 --> 00:46:09.413
Stephen Hawking, for example,

801
00:46:09.413 --> 00:46:13.430
a world famous astrophysicist, recently said yes,

802
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.099
there's extraterrestrial life but it may not be friendly.

803
00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:20.662
<v Regina>There are always interpretations.</v>

804
00:46:20.662 --> 00:46:23.466
<v ->Had a rather dark vision.</v>

805
00:46:23.466 --> 00:46:28.466
The main thing is that we're not alone in the cosmos,

806
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.779
and many scientists themselves

807
00:46:31.779 --> 00:46:35.784
are beginning to understand that.

808
00:46:35.784 --> 00:46:39.917
<v Regina>If we now take this back to, really to me,</v>

809
00:46:39.917 --> 00:46:44.352
the most critical element, which is the understanding,

810
00:46:44.352 --> 00:46:47.256
as we spoke about, of what we are,

811
00:46:47.256 --> 00:46:49.765
what a human being is, where we came from.

812
00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:51.297
We talked a little bit about the engineering

813
00:46:51.297 --> 00:46:54.873
of the vehicles, why would we have chosen this experience,

814
00:46:54.873 --> 00:46:57.822
and as you say, we can choose to go back into a state

815
00:46:57.822 --> 00:46:58.925
of pure consciousness.

816
00:46:58.925 --> 00:47:03.337
We do have that innate to our being, to do this.

817
00:47:03.337 --> 00:47:08.337
Would you then, that said, were you saying earlier

818
00:47:09.014 --> 00:47:14.014
that the need for a human vehicles was a need that was,

819
00:47:14.889 --> 00:47:17.757
it was more of a necessity created out of,

820
00:47:17.757 --> 00:47:20.694
you were talking about selfishness for example.

821
00:47:20.694 --> 00:47:23.794
Was that somehow a corruption of our truest essence

822
00:47:23.794 --> 00:47:27.567
that needed a form of expression in this realm

823
00:47:27.567 --> 00:47:29.471
where it could be played out?

824
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:34.471
<v ->On the level of pure consciousness, we have a form</v>

825
00:47:36.433 --> 00:47:38.814
made of pure consciousness.

826
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:43.814
There is a body up there.

827
00:47:44.015 --> 00:47:48.485
It's not that form is something that

828
00:47:48.485 --> 00:47:52.827
just comes because of our selfishness,

829
00:47:52.827 --> 00:47:57.332
but the problem is when we become selfish

830
00:47:57.332 --> 00:47:59.933
that form of pure consciousness

831
00:47:59.933 --> 00:48:03.369
cannot be made to function in that way.

832
00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:08.369
We need another type of vehicle that we can use

833
00:48:09.511 --> 00:48:11.508
to act out our selfish desires,

834
00:48:11.508 --> 00:48:14.619
because the original body of pure consciousness,

835
00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:17.487
it wont operate like that.

836
00:48:17.487 --> 00:48:18.857
<v Regina>So, there was a need to explore</v>

837
00:48:18.857 --> 00:48:22.777
this individual aspect of self on some level?

838
00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:27.777
<v ->It's not something that's required.</v>

839
00:48:28.678 --> 00:48:32.701
Different people will have different opinions about this.

840
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:35.603
The way I look at it is, we could have remained

841
00:48:35.603 --> 00:48:38.506
on that level of pure consciousness

842
00:48:38.506 --> 00:48:40.212
and just continued to function

843
00:48:40.212 --> 00:48:42.674
in loving harmony with each other.

844
00:48:42.674 --> 00:48:45.507
That's a distinct possibility.

845
00:48:45.507 --> 00:48:47.678
We would have functioned in forms

846
00:48:47.678 --> 00:48:49.349
made of pure consciousness.

847
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:52.914
It's not that everything would be all merged into oneness,

848
00:48:52.914 --> 00:48:56.385
we would have a form of pure consciousness

849
00:48:56.385 --> 00:48:59.822
that is deathless, not subject to old age, disease,

850
00:48:59.822 --> 00:49:02.898
or any of these other defects,

851
00:49:02.898 --> 00:49:07.496
but if we disturb that harmony,

852
00:49:07.496 --> 00:49:09.168
the ruling principle there is love

853
00:49:09.168 --> 00:49:11.943
and love has to be freely given,

854
00:49:11.943 --> 00:49:15.344
which means it has to be a choice that's made

855
00:49:15.344 --> 00:49:18.142
from moment to moment.

856
00:49:18.142 --> 00:49:21.439
Because it's a choice that has to be made

857
00:49:21.439 --> 00:49:23.146
from moment to moment,

858
00:49:23.146 --> 00:49:27.019
that means

859
00:49:27.019 --> 00:49:30.549
you can not do that.

860
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:32.260
You can make another decision.

861
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.484
If it were forced, that you had to love,

862
00:49:35.484 --> 00:49:38.706
that's not real love.

863
00:49:41.156 --> 00:49:45.141
The way I look at it is, our having to accept

864
00:49:45.141 --> 00:49:48.566
a material vehicle on this level of reality

865
00:49:48.566 --> 00:49:53.547
is a consequence of a decision that we made

866
00:49:53.547 --> 00:49:57.622
on some higher level of reality to become selfish,

867
00:49:57.622 --> 00:50:01.012
put ourselves as number one.

868
00:50:01.012 --> 00:50:05.415
Then we're put in a position where we have to act out

869
00:50:05.415 --> 00:50:07.928
our desire to be number one

870
00:50:07.928 --> 00:50:09.728
in association with others

871
00:50:09.728 --> 00:50:14.337
who have also made a similar decision.

872
00:50:14.337 --> 00:50:15.428
That explains a lot.

873
00:50:15.428 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Regina>That explains a lot.</v>

874
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:20.676
(laughing)

875
00:50:20.676 --> 00:50:22.034
<v ->About this level of reality.</v>

876
00:50:22.034 --> 00:50:24.577
<v Regina>Reversing that and going back into</v>

877
00:50:24.577 --> 00:50:27.212
an understanding of our field of pure consciousness,

878
00:50:27.212 --> 00:50:29.616
of course, has a lot of consequences for the way things

879
00:50:29.616 --> 00:50:32.390
are done around this planet right now.

880
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:37.127
I would say, in summary, the movie The Day the Earth

881
00:50:37.127 --> 00:50:40.459
Stood Still, if you were the guy on the screen

882
00:50:40.459 --> 00:50:43.745
that came to give the human species

883
00:50:43.745 --> 00:50:46.566
a message at this time as to why it is,

884
00:50:46.566 --> 00:50:49.956
the need to understand our origins,

885
00:50:49.956 --> 00:50:52.778
what would that message be?

886
00:50:52.778 --> 00:50:55.239
<v ->We did not evolve up from matter.</v>

887
00:50:55.239 --> 00:50:59.140
We have devolved or come down from pure consciousness

888
00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.253
and we're meant to go back.

889
00:51:01.253 --> 00:51:06.253
That is the basic message that I would give.

890
00:51:06.582 --> 00:51:08.881
Now, I could elaborate on that.

891
00:51:08.881 --> 00:51:10.169
<v Regina>We got a few minutes, elaborate a</v>

892
00:51:10.169 --> 00:51:12.539
little bit more.

893
00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:21.339
<v ->We see two kinds of people in the world today.</v>

894
00:51:22.235 --> 00:51:27.204
One type of person is becoming more and more involved

895
00:51:27.204 --> 00:51:31.279
in trying to dominate and control and exploit

896
00:51:31.279 --> 00:51:34.709
matter and other people

897
00:51:34.709 --> 00:51:38.279
and other life forms.

898
00:51:38.279 --> 00:51:42.352
Another type of person is trying to understand

899
00:51:42.352 --> 00:51:44.756
I'm a being of pure consciousness.

900
00:51:44.756 --> 00:51:48.726
I'm not some molecular robot in competition

901
00:51:48.726 --> 00:51:51.594
with other molecular robots.

902
00:51:51.594 --> 00:51:53.939
I'm a being of pure consciousness.

903
00:51:53.939 --> 00:51:56.830
Others are beings of pure consciousness.

904
00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.610
We're all in this together, let's live as simply

905
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.380
and naturally as we can on this planet,

906
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.380
just taking what we need for our material necessities.

907
00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:09.578
I think it was Gandhi who once said,

908
00:52:09.578 --> 00:52:12.689
"On this earth, there's enough for everyone's need,

909
00:52:12.689 --> 00:52:14.628
"there's not enough for everyone's greed,"

910
00:52:14.628 --> 00:52:18.762
because that greed is unlimited.

911
00:52:18.762 --> 00:52:20.152
<v Regina>Profound and true.</v>

912
00:52:20.152 --> 00:52:21.696
<v ->I think that's at the root of</v>

913
00:52:21.696 --> 00:52:23.495
the world's financial crisis.

914
00:52:23.495 --> 00:52:28.104
Some people were trying to exploit others

915
00:52:28.104 --> 00:52:31.204
in that financial system in such a way that

916
00:52:31.204 --> 00:52:34.803
their greed would be satisfied at the expense of others,

917
00:52:34.803 --> 00:52:38.740
so, it wasn't a nice situation.

918
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:46.250
The key is to engage in the techniques

919
00:52:46.358 --> 00:52:51.358
that will allow us to uncover the real essence

920
00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:56.029
of the human self, which is that being of pure consciousness

921
00:52:56.029 --> 00:52:58.827
that we all are.

922
00:52:58.827 --> 00:53:01.033
There are techniques for doing that.

923
00:53:01.033 --> 00:53:05.967
Just like a geologist could tell us how to extract

924
00:53:05.967 --> 00:53:08.870
the element gold from its ore

925
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:12.074
where it's mixed with other less valuable elements.

926
00:53:12.074 --> 00:53:15.569
Once you've extracted the gold,

927
00:53:15.569 --> 00:53:18.123
you could form it into coins.

928
00:53:18.123 --> 00:53:20.248
Then you could stamp the coins with the symbols

929
00:53:20.248 --> 00:53:22.187
of different nations.

930
00:53:22.187 --> 00:53:26.831
But, if it's really gold, it doesn't matter what symbol

931
00:53:26.831 --> 00:53:28.433
you stamped on it.

932
00:53:28.433 --> 00:53:31.927
Gold has its own value apart from

933
00:53:31.927 --> 00:53:34.365
the symbol that's stamped on it.

934
00:53:34.365 --> 00:53:39.365
Similarly, if by some technique of meditation,

935
00:53:40.577 --> 00:53:44.013
contemplation, yoga, or whatever,

936
00:53:44.013 --> 00:53:48.309
we're able to extract the element of pure consciousness

937
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:53.081
from our being and recognize it in others,

938
00:53:53.081 --> 00:53:57.957
then it doesn't matter what you call it.

939
00:53:57.957 --> 00:54:01.123
You could call it Christianity, or Hinduism, or Judaism,

940
00:54:01.123 --> 00:54:05.361
or Buddhism, or whatever.

941
00:54:05.361 --> 00:54:07.137
The name isn't important.

942
00:54:07.137 --> 00:54:11.108
What's important is that you've gotten the result.

943
00:54:11.108 --> 00:54:15.113
You recognize yourself as a being of pure consciousness.

944
00:54:15.113 --> 00:54:19.908
You recognize others as beings of pure consciousness.

945
00:54:19.908 --> 00:54:24.274
Then you've begun to structure your life in such a way

946
00:54:24.274 --> 00:54:28.047
as to live out that principle.

947
00:54:28.047 --> 00:54:31.228
The more people that are doing that,

948
00:54:31.228 --> 00:54:35.733
the better the condition of the world is going to be.

949
00:54:35.733 --> 00:54:40.733
The more people who are getting more deeply involved

950
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:44.858
in trying to dominate, control, and exploit matter

951
00:54:44.858 --> 00:54:49.858
in competition with others, then,

952
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:57.107
it's just going to get worse.

953
00:54:57.107 --> 00:55:02.107
The decisions about these things lie in our hands.

954
00:55:03.051 --> 00:55:07.962
We can individually try to make the choices

955
00:55:07.962 --> 00:55:11.131
that are going to lead us individually and collectively

956
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:12.966
in the right path.

957
00:55:12.966 --> 00:55:16.437
Eventually, it would be nice, if whole societies

958
00:55:16.437 --> 00:55:20.106
could be structured in such a way as to encourage this.

959
00:55:20.106 --> 00:55:23.030
Now, you have to do it on your own.

960
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:26.848
As far as the education system goes,

961
00:55:26.848 --> 00:55:28.543
and the governmental structures,

962
00:55:28.543 --> 00:55:30.412
and the economic structures,

963
00:55:30.412 --> 00:55:33.118
they're encouraging the wrong understandings

964
00:55:33.118 --> 00:55:35.722
and values at this point.

965
00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:37.994
<v Regina>Yes, it's up to us individually</v>

966
00:55:37.994 --> 00:55:40.722
to have to take it on until it becomes more collective.

967
00:55:40.722 --> 00:55:42.359
<v ->That's right.</v>

968
00:55:42.359 --> 00:55:43.857
<v Regina>Well, you could not have said that</v>

969
00:55:43.857 --> 00:55:45.285
more beautifully, and I'm so glad

970
00:55:45.285 --> 00:55:46.829
we finally had a chance to meet.

971
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:48.768
Thank you for your time.

972
00:55:48.768 --> 00:55:51.266
<v ->Well, thank you, Regina.</v>

973
00:55:52.936 --> 00:55:54.538
<v ->You can pick up a copy of Michael's book</v>

974
00:55:54.538 --> 00:55:56.744
Forbidden Archaeology at his website at

975
00:55:56.744 --> 00:55:58.416
MCremo.com

976
00:55:58.416 --> 00:56:01.144
It's time to open up conversation on this critical subject

977
00:56:01.144 --> 00:56:04.256
and not just march forward without asking why any longer.

978
00:56:04.256 --> 00:56:05.846
Meanwhile, we touched on some of this

979
00:56:05.846 --> 00:56:07.924
in our recent conversation with Gregg Braden,

980
00:56:07.924 --> 00:56:09.991
which you can also see here on CMN.

981
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:13.840
Until next time, thanks for watching.
