00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.669
<v ->Most of us have no idea how devastating a life lived</v>

2
00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.544
indoors in front of our computers and televisions

3
00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:09.344
has affected our well-being, mentally, physically,

4
00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:10.705
and emotionally.

5
00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:13.884
In fact, we were born to be bathed in light and color.

6
00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:16.704
Fortunately, Brian Breiling and others have begun bringing

7
00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.664
light and color therapy to the forefront of healing.

8
00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.763
A favorite healing modality of mine for over

9
00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:24.352
20 years now, color and light are profound

10
00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:26.172
and immediate in their effects.

11
00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.273
Brian began his journey with colors nearly

12
00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:29.794
20 years ago.

13
00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:34.531 line:15% 
(lively piano and light drumming)

14
00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.453
So, well first of all,

15
00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:44.893
it's starting to appear that an awful lot of our chronic

16
00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:47.491
disorders, not just with children but with adults,

17
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.116
are stemming from a lack of contact with light.

18
00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:54.677
And also a living in a world where we're not getting

19
00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:58.638
true color, light and color, and these ancient, ancient

20
00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:01.676
forms of healing, thank God, are being remembered,

21
00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:03.537
and people like yourself are bringing them back.

22
00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:06.597
But what is happening when you live a life

23
00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:09.297
sitting in a drab office, or driving on a freeway

24
00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:12.998
looking at gray tar, you know overcast skies,

25
00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:15.478
and you're deprived of real light?

26
00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:16.776
What happens to the being?

27
00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.435
<v ->Well it's kind of a brain toxic</v>

28
00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.415
and certainly an emotionally toxic lifestyle.

29
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.715
And we've forgotten that we are creatures

30
00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:28.035
of nature, that we were designed to live

31
00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:31.075
and work outdoors, and since the industrial

32
00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:33.443
revolution we've moved inside

33
00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:36.804
under artificial light that is great for reading,

34
00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:38.466
but not so great for our health.

35
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.166
And the ultimate source of light and healthy light

36
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:45.305
is sunlight, and being without an adequate

37
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.885
amount of sunlight or the color distribution

38
00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:50.245
of sunlight would make someone mentally

39
00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:54.184
dull, foggy, perhaps increase anxiety,

40
00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:56.965
and even in our common language

41
00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:59.284
we have ideas like someone is dull

42
00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:02.164
or dim-witted, versus if someone is having

43
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:05.585
enough light they're bright, they're illuminated,

44
00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.165
or to the ultimate extreme, even enlightened.

45
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:08.965
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

46
00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:12.203
<v ->Light has such a profound effect</v>

47
00:02:12.203 --> 00:02:14.747
on our health and I think it's the most

48
00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:16.706
underrated aspect of our health.

49
00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:18.685
<v Regina>Mhmm, I agree with you.</v>

50
00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:20.905
I mean we're seeing evidence of it.

51
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.185
Look at all the kids and people that are putting on,

52
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.365
as they say, vitamin P, Prozac.

53
00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:27.207
How much of that do you think is actually

54
00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:30.525
related to the fact that their beings are light deprived?

55
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.067
<v ->Quite a lot.</v>

56
00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:35.525
You know, our, if you look at circadian rhythms,

57
00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:38.506
our 24 hour biochemistry,

58
00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:41.586
our sleep, we have a sleep chemistry that comes on at night

59
00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:44.026
if we're lucky, and we have a daytime chemistry

60
00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:47.227
that gears us for alertness and energy and action.

61
00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:49.507
If someone stays up too late or is involved

62
00:02:49.507 --> 00:02:52.647
in an artifically lit environment, that is not

63
00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:55.928
healthy for them, it can throw off their circadian rhythms,

64
00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:58.645
and indeed in very conservative medical circles

65
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.086
they're looking at all psychiatric illness,

66
00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:04.645
not only depression, winter depression, bipolar illness,

67
00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:08.745
things like schizophrenia, even Alzheimer's disease

68
00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:12.025
being related to a circadian rhythm disturbance

69
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.686
which has do do,

70
00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:16.166
essentially with our rhythms being out of balance

71
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.677
because we're not exposed

72
00:03:17.677 --> 00:03:20.237
to the natural frequencies of sunlight.

73
00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:24.257
And using artificial light sources that mimic sunlight,

74
00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:27.077
you can put people back in rhythm

75
00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:30.097
with their 24 hour biochemistry, and really help them

76
00:03:30.097 --> 00:03:32.597
profoundly, mentally and emotionally.

77
00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:35.197
Even someone as far gone as in the early

78
00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.457
or middle stages of Alzheimer's will respond to artificial

79
00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:41.692
bright, white light to help balance

80
00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:43.933
their brain chemistry and also put them

81
00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:46.074
in sync with their 24 hour rhythm.

82
00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.133
<v Regina>Yes and often that makes sense,</v>

83
00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.334
because people with Alzheimer's are often elderly,

84
00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.195
and they're often shut-ins.

85
00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:52.995
<v ->That's right</v>

86
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:55.014
<v Regina>And so they're getting almost no natural light.</v>

87
00:03:55.014 --> 00:03:56.135
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

88
00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.253
<v Regina>That's very interesting.</v>

89
00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.173
<v ->And they have what's called free-running</v>

90
00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.075
circadian clocks, the sundowner syndrome,

91
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.514
where they'll go to bed at a different time every night,

92
00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:08.054
which is really a problem for caregivers,

93
00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:09.453
especially if they get out in the middle of the night

94
00:04:09.453 --> 00:04:10.855
and wander the streets.

95
00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:11.424
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

96
00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:14.101
<v ->What they're finding now is putting very bright light</v>

97
00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:16.381
that's diffuse, 20 times brighter than our normal

98
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.380
indoor light, but it's diffuse, it's like looking through

99
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.042
a rice paper, like a shoji screen,

100
00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:23.842
but if you put that in the day room

101
00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:26.002
where these Alzheimer's patients are,

102
00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.121
it'll normalize their circadian rhythm.

103
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.781
It'll quiet their agitation

104
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:33.762
and help them sleep through the night,

105
00:04:33.762 --> 00:04:36.542
and it's such a great help for the caregivers

106
00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.201
in even a hospital situation,

107
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:41.445
but I imagine even for those who are caring

108
00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:44.146
for Alzheimer's patients at home.

109
00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:46.286
<v Regina>Mhmm, and when you got into it,</v>

110
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.186
it was the other end of the spectrum,

111
00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:50.926
you were actually interested in children who were displaying

112
00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:53.107
a lot of hyperactive behaviors and so forth.

113
00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:53.817
<v ->Exactly.</v>

114
00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:55.796
<v Regina>So tell us how you got into this,</v>

115
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.958
and where your original discoveries were.

116
00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.167
<v ->In the late 1970s, I was a school psychologist</v>

117
00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:05.686
and a lot of the special-ed students,

118
00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:08.865
50% of 'em, and some of the classes were on medication.

119
00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:10.125
These were young kids, these were--

120
00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.027
<v Regina>What percent?</v>

121
00:05:11.027 --> 00:05:13.688
<v ->50%, this was in the early 70s,</v>

122
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:14.905
and it went through a dip.

123
00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.827
And now we're seeing in the last several years,

124
00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:19.229
kids going through more medication,

125
00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.148
and I can talk about medication as a consumer.

126
00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:24.305
I'm a psychologist, I'm not a medical doctor,

127
00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:27.185
but I thought, there had to be a way naturally,

128
00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.857
that we can provide the children's brains

129
00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:31.177
and nervous systems with what they

130
00:05:31.177 --> 00:05:33.757
would need to either focus and concentrate,

131
00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:34.857
or slow down,

132
00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:37.737
whatever their particular biochemistry needed.

133
00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:40.577
Could we do this with non-drug alternatives?

134
00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:43.638
And I started to explore biofeedback training,

135
00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:46.157
EEG biofeedback and temperature warming,

136
00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:48.637
and muscle relaxation, essentially teaching kids

137
00:05:48.637 --> 00:05:50.499
how to be better yogis, how to control

138
00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.557
their biochemistry by self-regulation techniques.

139
00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:56.657
A friend of mine who's an optometrist taught

140
00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.715
me that everything I was doing with brain wave

141
00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:01.015
biofeedback I could do better with light,

142
00:06:01.015 --> 00:06:03.095
and that started me on a journey that's been

143
00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:05.755
about 20 years now, using bright, white light,

144
00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:08.555
and then alternatively, specific colors of light

145
00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.075
through the eyes, not only working with children

146
00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:12.995
with learning problems, but more recently

147
00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:15.615
using different colors of strobing light

148
00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:19.255
or solid light to help people unravel their traumas

149
00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:24.173
that long-time held emotional difficulties in psychotherapy.

150
00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:26.973
And that's my real passion, is working,

151
00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:29.753
using colored light as a tool to help awaken

152
00:06:29.753 --> 00:06:30.783
consciousness.

153
00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:31.541
<v Regina>Right.</v>

154
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.988
<v ->Help people be the very best they can be</v>

155
00:06:32.988 --> 00:06:36.185
emotionally, mentally, using light as a performance tool

156
00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:38.586
and helping people let go of chronically held

157
00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:41.325
physical tensions, emotional tensions,

158
00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:42.605
and light does that.

159
00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:45.511
It's for me, like the ultimate power tool.

160
00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:48.411
<v Regina>Mhmm, absolutely, and one of the most</v>

161
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.231
available power tools out there.

162
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:50.951
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

163
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:52.319
<v Regina>And inexpensive power tools.</v>

164
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.039
<v ->That's right.</v>

165
00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.387
<v Regina>Now in the 1970s, that was before</v>

166
00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:56.125
we even had video games, so you weren't getting

167
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.326
that whole interface going on with the kids,

168
00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:01.285
but people were eating a lot of sugared cereals

169
00:07:01.285 --> 00:07:02.665
for breakfast and the like,

170
00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:04.506
and so you had that type of thing.

171
00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:06.926
What does it look like now with kids who

172
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.505
basically are shut in?

173
00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:10.825
<v ->Shut in, video game addicitions,</v>

174
00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:14.528
iPods tuning out, all kinds of attention problems

175
00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:17.788
and mood disorders from kids essentially being

176
00:07:17.788 --> 00:07:19.707
indoors too much, and adults.

177
00:07:19.707 --> 00:07:23.147
I mean I think this obesity epidemic that we're seeing

178
00:07:23.147 --> 00:07:25.465
is partly because of our indoor light style,

179
00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:26.846
lifestyle, light style too.

180
00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:27.406
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

181
00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:29.806
<v ->And also because of our diet--</v>

182
00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:30.603
<v Regina>Right.</v>

183
00:07:30.603 --> 00:07:33.386
<v ->And if we can use both of those, diet, exercise,</v>

184
00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:36.104
herbs, as well as natural things as light,

185
00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:37.704
we might be able to titrate down

186
00:07:37.704 --> 00:07:40.464
some of the medications, at least that was my hope.

187
00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:43.564
<v Regina>Yeah, so let's look at that about,</v>

188
00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:46.387
well you just talked about the subject of obesity,

189
00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:50.424
for example, have you used color at all

190
00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:52.764
when it comes to various types of addictions,

191
00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.906
and like you say, mood-altering, certainly,

192
00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:58.297
but even to help break addictive patterns and the like?

193
00:07:58.297 --> 00:07:59.355
<v ->Yes.</v>

194
00:07:59.355 --> 00:08:02.834
Just the mainstream medical research the last 20 years

195
00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:06.017
has looked at bright, white light for winter depression,

196
00:08:06.017 --> 00:08:09.414
and the things that we used to treat, that I still treat

197
00:08:09.414 --> 00:08:13.074
with things, the class of drugs, selective serotonin

198
00:08:13.074 --> 00:08:15.677
reuptake inhibitors like Prozac,

199
00:08:15.677 --> 00:08:17.234
and one of the light research studies

200
00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:18.554
that was fascinating to me

201
00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:21.875
was that there's a type of bulimia, an eating disorder

202
00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:24.756
that has to do with people craving carbohydrates

203
00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:28.134
and putting on an extra 15, 20 pounds in the winter.

204
00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:29.793
<v Regina>That's very light associated, isn't it--</v>

205
00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:30.913
<v ->It's very light associated.</v>

206
00:08:30.913 --> 00:08:32.115
<v Regina>Serotonin cycles, yeah.</v>

207
00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:33.436
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

208
00:08:33.436 --> 00:08:35.096
So during the dark, winter months,

209
00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:37.555
people try to replace that fall in serotonin

210
00:08:37.555 --> 00:08:39.315
from a lack of light,

211
00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:41.937
so light balances, increases serotonin,

212
00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:44.975
and also norepinephrine, which means that bright light,

213
00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.676
sun light, or even some very conscious use

214
00:08:47.676 --> 00:08:50.739
of wonderful, artificial, broad-spectrum light

215
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.435
in your work situation or in your home

216
00:08:53.435 --> 00:08:56.898
can help really balance your brain chemistry profoundly.

217
00:08:56.898 --> 00:09:00.755
And that has, obviously upshots, for things like obesity.

218
00:09:00.755 --> 00:09:01.575
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

219
00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.235
<v ->Now behind every addiction,</v>

220
00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:06.214
there is a wall of chronic pain.

221
00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:09.014
And people use their addictions to run from something

222
00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:10.575
that's traumatic, something that happened

223
00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:14.275
in childhood, maybe the loss of a current relationship,

224
00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:16.876
a disappointment at work, what have you.

225
00:09:16.876 --> 00:09:20.318
And using colored light, we can go into those

226
00:09:20.318 --> 00:09:24.015
areas that they have shut down their emotional processing

227
00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:25.576
and then help give them back

228
00:09:25.576 --> 00:09:27.738
more control of their emotional life.

229
00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:28.935
<v Regina>And it is interesting</v>

230
00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:31.638
because of the very strong responses,

231
00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:33.878
and we were talking off camera a little bit

232
00:09:33.878 --> 00:09:37.417
about watching people turn around so rapidly

233
00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:40.277
by infusing the color they're repulsed by.

234
00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:41.029
<v ->Right.</v>

235
00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:43.927
<v Regina>Talk about an emotional landmine waiting there.</v>

236
00:09:43.927 --> 00:09:45.608
Can you talk about what happens?

237
00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:48.465
<v ->Yeah, we have comfort colors</v>

238
00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:51.925
and we have colors that I jokingly say we're allergic to.

239
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.465
There's colors that we go, "Oh I just want more of that,

240
00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:55.525
"I really love that."

241
00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:57.405
Then there's colors we want to push away,

242
00:09:57.405 --> 00:09:59.165
and I can even show this

243
00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:02.025
like taking people through 20 pieces of colored paper.

244
00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:04.085
There will be colors that people will immediately

245
00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:07.127
gravitate towards and others they'll be repulsed by.

246
00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:10.025
But by slowly and very compassionately learning

247
00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:13.595
to sit with what we feel and what we think

248
00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:16.028
when we're looking at a particular color of light,

249
00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:18.122
you can also do it with reflected colors,

250
00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:20.942
like wall colors or I was mentioning, colored paper.

251
00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:23.860
But colored light gives the quickest result.

252
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.540
Things come up emotionally that they may not have

253
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.439
been aware of.

254
00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:30.274
They may have not have thought about for years,

255
00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:32.874
and it just helps 'em with breathing

256
00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:34.872
and bringing awareness and all the things

257
00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:38.272
we do in psychotherapy to keep them present in their body

258
00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:40.456
to help them go through that in a quicker way

259
00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:42.974
than they would have without it,

260
00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:47.054
so the rejected colors are very significant,

261
00:10:47.054 --> 00:10:49.134
and I think the goal--

262
00:10:49.134 --> 00:10:50.552
<v Regina>Everybody needs to take a little moment</v>

263
00:10:50.552 --> 00:10:51.830
and think about that right now.

264
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.270
What colors do I really, really hate you know and--

265
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.140
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

266
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.528
<v Regina>Versus which ones do I find,</v>

267
00:10:56.528 --> 00:10:58.738
'cause for a lot of men, for example,

268
00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:02.344
they live in a world of say blue and red.

269
00:11:02.344 --> 00:11:03.004
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

270
00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:04.961
<v Regina>Those are the dominant male colors as I recall,</v>

271
00:11:04.961 --> 00:11:05.399
right?

272
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.279
<v ->Right, right.</v>

273
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.599
The power of colors in business.

274
00:11:07.599 --> 00:11:09.115
The blue suit, the red tie.

275
00:11:09.115 --> 00:11:09.915
That, for example--

276
00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:11.834
<v Regina>And blue being very mental, very analytical,</v>

277
00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:15.485
and manifestation, power of the blood red and so forth--

278
00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:16.225
<v ->Exactly.</v>

279
00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:17.705
<v Regina>But look at all those colors that are missing</v>

280
00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:18.403
in between.

281
00:11:18.403 --> 00:11:19.423
What would happen?

282
00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:21.245
I love to see a man in a pink shirt.

283
00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:21.923
<v ->Yeah.</v>

284
00:11:21.923 --> 00:11:23.325
<v Regina>I just think it's a beautiful resonance.</v>

285
00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:24.943
So what happens, you take a guy like that

286
00:11:24.943 --> 00:11:26.364
and you put him in pink?

287
00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:27.881
<v ->Well, if he's manly...</v>

288
00:11:27.881 --> 00:11:28.899
(laughing)

289
00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:30.700
And he's big enough to accept that.

290
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.301
When I work with people,

291
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:35.440
to have them get more comfortable with the colors

292
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.999
they push away, they become more full spectrum humans,

293
00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.239
that the colors they previously rejected,

294
00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:44.199
they start wearing and start experimenting more

295
00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:45.340
with their life.

296
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.581
And some of this is constitutional

297
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:49.560
and some of it's seasonal related too.

298
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.240
It's like, in the middle of summer,

299
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.481
when it's a hundred degrees in Sacramento,

300
00:11:53.481 --> 00:11:56.439
we're not gonna want huge amounts of artificial light

301
00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:58.159
or even huge amounts of sunlight.

302
00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:00.039
We're trying to run away from the heat.

303
00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:01.779
And in the summer, we'll gravitate towards

304
00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:04.077
the cooler colors, the greens, the blues,

305
00:12:04.077 --> 00:12:05.709
that type of thing.

306
00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:06.517
<v Regina>Pastels, yellow.</v>

307
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:07.414
<v ->Pastels, exactly.</v>

308
00:12:07.414 --> 00:12:10.871
But in everyday life, I think if a man,

309
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.350
our archetypal business man were to become comfortable

310
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.057
with all his colors that he pushed away,

311
00:12:17.057 --> 00:12:19.996
he'd be a better father, he'd be a better husband.

312
00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:21.775
He'd be more emotionally responsive.

313
00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:24.376
And, I believe it would have greater access

314
00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:26.617
to the creative potential in parts of his brain

315
00:12:26.617 --> 00:12:28.715
that he may have been shutting away,

316
00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:31.685
so he would be I think a fuller human,

317
00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.332
which is the goal for all of us.

318
00:12:33.332 --> 00:12:34.372
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

319
00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:35.539
And would you mind going into,

320
00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:36.859
without names of course,

321
00:12:36.859 --> 00:12:38.618
a couple of case studies that you found

322
00:12:38.618 --> 00:12:41.618
particularly fascinating and maybe even profound

323
00:12:41.618 --> 00:12:42.759
in their effects?

324
00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:43.959
<v ->This is great.</v>

325
00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:45.958
There's a woman, I'll call her Louise.

326
00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.299
She was a very conservative computer programmer.

327
00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:50.619
And, she came to my office.

328
00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:53.758
I had seen her in talk therapy for about five years,

329
00:12:53.758 --> 00:12:57.236
and she had a severe migraine, and she said,

330
00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.546
"I have a very bad migraine."

331
00:12:58.546 --> 00:12:59.504
I said, "Oh, I'm so sorry."

332
00:12:59.504 --> 00:13:02.340
We were talking about something stressful related to her

333
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.237
relationship with her mother, and she said,

334
00:13:05.237 --> 00:13:07.476
"Oh my God, I don't have my medication."

335
00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:08.499
And I said, "Oh, that's OK.

336
00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:08.997
"We can take--"

337
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:09.999
She says, "You don't understand.

338
00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:12.777
"I always go to the hospital and I start throwing up.

339
00:13:12.777 --> 00:13:15.415
"These migraines come on very intensely."

340
00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:18.135
So, this was at a time that I didn't

341
00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:22.035
incorporate light into my psychotherapy practice,

342
00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:23.837
and I had nothing to lose

343
00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.373
so I put this woman under a colored light,

344
00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:28.552
violet, associated where she was experiencing

345
00:13:28.552 --> 00:13:31.294
the migraine in the top of her head,

346
00:13:31.294 --> 00:13:32.674
and I just had her talk.

347
00:13:32.674 --> 00:13:33.874
Tell me what's going on in your mind.

348
00:13:33.874 --> 00:13:35.993
Let's talk about your mother, where you left off.

349
00:13:35.993 --> 00:13:38.172
And she felt increased blood flow

350
00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:42.252
into her head, and then the tears would come,

351
00:13:42.252 --> 00:13:46.735
that she saw the difficulty she had connecting

352
00:13:46.735 --> 00:13:48.553
with this man that she ultimately married,

353
00:13:48.553 --> 00:13:50.052
and how she was pushing him away

354
00:13:50.052 --> 00:13:52.252
because she didn't trust him.

355
00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:55.231
And as the tears came, the headache started to break,

356
00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:59.231
and the migraine dissipated within about ten minutes.

357
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:02.993
And that was big enough for me as my first

358
00:14:02.993 --> 00:14:06.844
kind of like, I had to think on my feet to use light,

359
00:14:06.844 --> 00:14:09.693
to see that it could be used psycho therapeutically

360
00:14:09.693 --> 00:14:10.791
at the same time.

361
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:13.411
I mean you can use light as a drug,

362
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:17.591
which light will have drug-like effects on our biochemistry,

363
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:19.291
and certainly our hormones.

364
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.933
But you can use it to help open consciousness.

365
00:14:21.933 --> 00:14:24.571
And the other thing that was extraordinary about this case,

366
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.820
'cause here's a woman who's very conservative,

367
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.379
it wasn't somebody that indeed,

368
00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:30.801
and at a time in my practice 20 years ago,

369
00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:34.319
that I would be hesitant to talk about things spiritual.

370
00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:35.069
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

371
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:37.160
<v ->But as she started releasing this headache,</v>

372
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.720
she started going into this full body energetic release,

373
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.382
and I just encouraged her to breathe

374
00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.442
and go into it as she was looking at this violet

375
00:14:44.442 --> 00:14:45.520
light talking.

376
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.159
And in a period of 15-20 minutes,

377
00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:50.302
she had a full blown,

378
00:14:50.302 --> 00:14:51.901
what I would say, a surrendering,

379
00:14:51.901 --> 00:14:54.979
an opening, a spiritual opening experience.

380
00:14:54.979 --> 00:14:56.660
And we can put other words on it,

381
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.339
maybe it was a Kundalini opening

382
00:14:58.339 --> 00:14:59.278
or opening of her heart,

383
00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:00.718
but her heart did open,

384
00:15:00.718 --> 00:15:02.998
and tears of joy started coming through.

385
00:15:02.998 --> 00:15:06.258
And she said, "As a young girl I really had a mystical

386
00:15:06.258 --> 00:15:07.977
"connection with Mother Mary,

387
00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:09.237
"and I yearn for this.

388
00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:10.937
"I've had my fight with the church."

389
00:15:10.937 --> 00:15:12.978
I won't say which church she was involved in.

390
00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:17.137
"And I really yearn for that spiritual quality in my life."

391
00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:19.037
"And this is bringing it back."

392
00:15:19.037 --> 00:15:21.957
So, that was the beginning,

393
00:15:21.957 --> 00:15:24.397
that was the first time I had seen somebody

394
00:15:24.397 --> 00:15:26.960
go into a spiritual experience in my office

395
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.097
just using light through the eyes.

396
00:15:29.097 --> 00:15:29.778
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

397
00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:30.796
<v ->And from there and on,</v>

398
00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:33.138
she used to have migraines even with medications

399
00:15:33.138 --> 00:15:34.377
several times of week,

400
00:15:34.377 --> 00:15:36.096
and the medication was doing a good job

401
00:15:36.096 --> 00:15:37.936
that she could you know, make her salary

402
00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:39.436
as a computer programmer,

403
00:15:39.436 --> 00:15:44.405
but the headaches went to once every three months,

404
00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:45.795
and once every six months

405
00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:48.708
as she started working her consciousness with light.

406
00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:49.339
<v Regina>Right.</v>

407
00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:50.916
<v ->And then, you know, we terminated.</v>

408
00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:54.915
But that one experience with light was such a profound

409
00:15:54.915 --> 00:15:58.337
gift for me, because it showed me what was possible

410
00:15:58.337 --> 00:16:01.154
emotionally, what was possible physically,

411
00:16:01.154 --> 00:16:03.814
and what's possible certainly spiritually.

412
00:16:03.814 --> 00:16:06.292
My wife Jennifer over here is a chiropractor.

413
00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:08.252
She'll see people in chronic pain.

414
00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:10.512
We'll work with people psychologically

415
00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.412
with light through the eyes and often times

416
00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:14.732
in a short period of time, chronically held pain

417
00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:17.292
for 10-15 years can be dissipated

418
00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:20.252
in a matter of just a few office sessions.

419
00:16:20.252 --> 00:16:21.452
And people are amazed by it

420
00:16:21.452 --> 00:16:24.085
'cause I think that somehow we get used to pain

421
00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:25.686
and think it's our birthright that--

422
00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:26.437
(laughing)

423
00:16:26.437 --> 00:16:26.914
<v Regina>Right.</v>

424
00:16:26.914 --> 00:16:28.135
<v ->You know, we confuse our identity</v>

425
00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:29.675
that you know, my pain, myself,

426
00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:32.955
and when they can release it and open up to

427
00:16:32.955 --> 00:16:34.955
indeed the emotional pain that often

428
00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:37.952
is you know chronically held in the musculature.

429
00:16:37.952 --> 00:16:39.111
When that lets go,

430
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:41.551
their lives can be profoundly transformed,

431
00:16:41.551 --> 00:16:44.711
and I'm not into seeing people for 20 years

432
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:47.351
and you know, being their mommy or their best friend.

433
00:16:47.351 --> 00:16:48.251
<v Regina>Right.</v>

434
00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:50.191
<v ->But to help people just using light</v>

435
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:53.131
as a stimulus to help them transform

436
00:16:53.131 --> 00:16:56.331
and leave their life a lot better than when they came in.

437
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.071
<v Regina>So it would seem that as you're working</v>

438
00:16:58.071 --> 00:16:59.211
with people with color,

439
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.856
you are working with consciousness.

440
00:17:00.856 --> 00:17:02.332
You're certainly working with the brain.

441
00:17:02.332 --> 00:17:02.992
<v ->Yes.</v>

442
00:17:02.992 --> 00:17:04.312
<v Regina>And all the glandular system.</v>

443
00:17:04.312 --> 00:17:04.838
<v ->Yes.</v>

444
00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:06.388
<v Regina>And it would be that those signals</v>

445
00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:09.028
are essentially balanced or altered

446
00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.909
as a results of this very natural phenomena,

447
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:13.768
back what it should have been and was all along

448
00:17:13.768 --> 00:17:15.889
until we started cloistering ourselves

449
00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:17.448
in our little cubbies at the office.

450
00:17:17.448 --> 00:17:18.209
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

451
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.668
<v Regina>And so the brain chemistry changes.</v>

452
00:17:19.668 --> 00:17:21.068
It sends different different signals,

453
00:17:21.068 --> 00:17:22.432
the inflammation starts going away.

454
00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:24.612
I mean it really is a cascading effect.

455
00:17:24.612 --> 00:17:26.992
<v ->Absolutely, our lives have profoundly changed</v>

456
00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:29.232
because of indoor light in the 1880s.

457
00:17:29.232 --> 00:17:32.452
I mean, 95% of us worked outdoors.

458
00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:37.052
We were agrarian, and we didn't live inside.

459
00:17:37.052 --> 00:17:40.662
And until the 1930s, when electric lights

460
00:17:40.662 --> 00:17:43.283
started to become widely available in the US,

461
00:17:43.283 --> 00:17:45.881
people slept an average of 10 hours a night.

462
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:46.521
<v Regina>Right.</v>

463
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.121
<v ->Now you and I don't know anybody in our lives</v>

464
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:50.021
who sleeps more than probably seven

465
00:17:50.021 --> 00:17:51.241
or eight hours a night.

466
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:51.862
<v Regina>Right.</v>

467
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.126
<v ->So think about, where's that three hours?</v>

468
00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:55.345
And before that, even in the Middle Ages,

469
00:17:55.345 --> 00:17:57.386
there's some documents that said the quote,

470
00:17:57.386 --> 00:17:59.913
"average person" used to sleep in two shifts

471
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.194
but about 14 hours a night.

472
00:18:02.194 --> 00:18:02.893
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

473
00:18:02.893 --> 00:18:03.894
<v ->And because of indoor light,</v>

474
00:18:03.894 --> 00:18:05.455
things like internet,

475
00:18:05.455 --> 00:18:07.774
you know 500 channels of cable TV,

476
00:18:07.774 --> 00:18:09.534
which are wonderful modern conveniences.

477
00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:11.853
And the internet, I wouldn't like to be without those,

478
00:18:11.853 --> 00:18:14.453
but it's profoundly changed our lifestyle.

479
00:18:14.453 --> 00:18:17.424
And indeed, I think we're burning the candle at both ends.

480
00:18:17.424 --> 00:18:19.865
I mean you see adrenal burnout, exhaustion.

481
00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.263
We call it depression.

482
00:18:21.263 --> 00:18:24.664
We're treating it with Prozac and SSRIs,

483
00:18:24.664 --> 00:18:25.900
which are very helpful.

484
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.081
People should not, you know have to go through

485
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:29.529
a suicidal crisis,

486
00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:32.451
and should have any help they can to get through that.

487
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:35.491
But, it's a matter of lifestyles have gone so far

488
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:38.291
out of balance because of our using indoor light,

489
00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:41.176
and not knowing how to maintain our connection

490
00:18:41.176 --> 00:18:42.536
with nature and sunlight,

491
00:18:42.536 --> 00:18:44.777
which drives every single biochemical reaction

492
00:18:44.777 --> 00:18:45.976
in our body.

493
00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:48.356
<v Regina>With all of that,</v>

494
00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:51.377
if you go to your doctor,

495
00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:54.456
first of all they're gonna warn you off of sun.

496
00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:55.197
<v ->Sure.</v>

497
00:18:55.197 --> 00:18:57.058
<v Regina>Now something's really frighteningly</v>

498
00:18:57.058 --> 00:18:58.076
wrong with that.

499
00:18:58.076 --> 00:18:58.757
<v ->Sure.</v>

500
00:18:58.757 --> 00:19:00.657
<v Regina>The very nutrients that feed our brains</v>

501
00:19:00.657 --> 00:19:02.436
and allow us to be vital human beings

502
00:19:02.436 --> 00:19:04.696
are the very things that we're frightened of now.

503
00:19:04.696 --> 00:19:05.358
<v ->Right.</v>

504
00:19:05.358 --> 00:19:06.915
<v Regina>Oh, you'll get you know skin cancer</v>

505
00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:07.913
and all of that.

506
00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:08.515
<v ->Right.</v>

507
00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:10.554
<v Regina>So can you address that a little bit?</v>

508
00:19:10.554 --> 00:19:12.773
<v ->Yeah, we've thrown the baby out with bathwater.</v>

509
00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:14.909
Use an analogy, it's like we're saying,

510
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:17.070
"Oh, because you can drowned in water,

511
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.291
"you've got to avoid water."

512
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:19.809
Well we need water for health

513
00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:21.746
and we've forgotten we need a certain amount

514
00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.266
of sunlight for health.

515
00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:24.866
And depending where we live,

516
00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:26.046
how north we live,

517
00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:28.907
our requirements for sunlight increase.

518
00:19:28.907 --> 00:19:30.707
There's been a lot of interest recently

519
00:19:30.707 --> 00:19:32.226
in Vitamin D, D3.

520
00:19:32.226 --> 00:19:32.846
<v Regina>Right.</v>

521
00:19:32.846 --> 00:19:34.806
<v ->The sunlight vitamin produced by</v>

522
00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:36.286
when sunlight hits the skin.

523
00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:38.646
It produces Vitamin D which is essential

524
00:19:38.646 --> 00:19:40.307
for the immune system.

525
00:19:40.307 --> 00:19:43.646
It's also essential for osteoporosis,

526
00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:45.627
mineralization of the bones.

527
00:19:45.627 --> 00:19:47.670
You need Vitamin D to mineralize your bones

528
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.252
and feel vital, so I'm running aside.

529
00:19:51.252 --> 00:19:52.591
So remind me what I was talking about.

530
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.232
<v Regina>Oh yeah.</v>

531
00:19:53.232 --> 00:19:54.060
<v ->This is a huge topic.</v>

532
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.659
<v Regina>The doctors basically are warning us off it.</v>

533
00:19:55.659 --> 00:19:56.440
"Oh no, it's scary.

534
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.979
"Skin cancers."

535
00:19:57.979 --> 00:19:58.700
<v ->Yeah.</v>

536
00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.900
<v Regina>And the reality is,</v>

537
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.639
even putting the sunblock on,

538
00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:04.059
you're blocking the absorption of the Vitamin D.

539
00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:04.998
<v ->Yes.</v>

540
00:20:04.998 --> 00:20:07.459
<v Regina>So, where's the truth lie in all of this</v>

541
00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:09.989
about going out and enjoying the sunshine?

542
00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:10.871
<v ->Well, the scary truth.</v>

543
00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:11.911
I mean we need sunshine.

544
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:12.762
I mean that's obvious.

545
00:20:12.762 --> 00:20:15.101
And our environment as The 11th Hour

546
00:20:15.101 --> 00:20:17.161
and all these wonderful films by Al Gore

547
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:20.261
have shown is really changing dramatically.

548
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.663
The Ozone layer is thinning dramatically

549
00:20:22.663 --> 00:20:25.202
in areas close to the equator

550
00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:27.869
so the quantity of the ultraviolet light,

551
00:20:27.869 --> 00:20:29.369
while we need ultraviolet light,

552
00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:31.761
a certain amount of it to produce Vitamin D,

553
00:20:31.761 --> 00:20:33.420
too much of it has been implicated

554
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.800
in certain skin cancers.

555
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.518
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

556
00:20:35.518 --> 00:20:38.500
<v ->And, so I think as a conscious health consumer,</v>

557
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.399
we have to become aware of our skin type.

558
00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:43.019
You know, are we like,

559
00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:45.341
are our eyes dark, you know full of melanin?

560
00:20:45.341 --> 00:20:46.190
Is are skin dark?

561
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.868
Or are we some of these people who really do better

562
00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:49.950
avoiding as much light.

563
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.611
You know like the Northern European people.

564
00:20:52.611 --> 00:20:54.920
<v Regina>Pale blue eyes, blond hair, pale, pale skin.</v>

565
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.249
<v ->Pale blue eyes, super white skin.</v>

566
00:20:56.249 --> 00:20:57.369
Exactly.

567
00:20:57.369 --> 00:20:59.631
But during the winter, places like Norway,

568
00:20:59.631 --> 00:21:01.010
there's certain places in Norway

569
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.989
and Northern England, they don't see the sunlight

570
00:21:02.989 --> 00:21:04.470
for 40 days a year.

571
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.191
<v Regina>Right.</v>

572
00:21:05.191 --> 00:21:06.241
<v ->It doesn't come over the horizon.</v>

573
00:21:06.241 --> 00:21:06.982
<v Regina>Right.</v>

574
00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:08.822
<v ->So there's all these, not only</v>

575
00:21:08.822 --> 00:21:11.622
you know increase alcoholism in places

576
00:21:11.622 --> 00:21:14.596
that are dark 'cause they're craving the serotonin.

577
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:17.544
But there's all these immune disorders that have to do

578
00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:21.542
with a lack of sunlight, and we need Vitamin D3,

579
00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:22.983
the sunlight vitamin,

580
00:21:22.983 --> 00:21:24.643
to keep our immune system up.

581
00:21:24.643 --> 00:21:27.515
And yeah, I'm concerned about you know the geometric rise

582
00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:30.295
in skin cancers, and I think part of it

583
00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:33.293
has to do with unconscious sun exposure.

584
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.434
<v Regina>Well, and also,</v>

585
00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:36.673
I remember reading a book.

586
00:21:36.673 --> 00:21:38.993
Oh gosh, I think it was in the early 80s

587
00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:40.133
called the Sugar Blues.

588
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:40.775
<v ->Yes.</v>

589
00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:42.133
<v Regina>And basically they were saying</v>

590
00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:45.294
in that book it was saying that a lot of the skin cancers

591
00:21:45.294 --> 00:21:47.693
are because we have poor dietary habits,

592
00:21:47.693 --> 00:21:50.793
especially sugar, and if you eat a lot of that,

593
00:21:50.793 --> 00:21:54.233
that interaction with whatever that creates in your skin,

594
00:21:54.233 --> 00:21:55.474
those chemicals with the sun,

595
00:21:55.474 --> 00:21:56.981
is actually what's creating the problem.

596
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:58.021
If you have a healthy diet,

597
00:21:58.021 --> 00:21:59.882
you shouldn't be experiencing those kinds of,

598
00:21:59.882 --> 00:22:03.141
in general, now granted the Ozone layer has depleted some

599
00:22:03.141 --> 00:22:05.610
since then, but still they say it's often a function

600
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.431
of diet.

601
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:09.090
<v ->Sure, acid diet with sugar,</v>

602
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.392
a lack of antioxidants, Vitamin A, E, D.

603
00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:14.570
All those things will help the sun,

604
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.050
you know basically protect itself.

605
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.751
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

606
00:22:17.751 --> 00:22:19.305
<v ->But we should know our skin type</v>

607
00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:22.664
and what is our minimum daily requirement for light.

608
00:22:22.664 --> 00:22:23.264
<v Regina>Right.</v>

609
00:22:23.264 --> 00:22:25.524
<v ->And that minimum daily requirement's gonna change</v>

610
00:22:25.524 --> 00:22:28.104
based on your skin color, your eye color,

611
00:22:28.104 --> 00:22:29.933
where you're living.

612
00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:32.233
Obviously, you know case in point,

613
00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:34.235
that when we go on vacations,

614
00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:36.313
most of us go to places that are sunny.

615
00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:37.014
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

616
00:22:37.014 --> 00:22:38.950
<v ->And we'll be completely white, unprepared,</v>

617
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.206
and go lie on Waikiki Beach, for example,

618
00:22:41.206 --> 00:22:43.797
and you walk by Waikiki and see everybody's--

619
00:22:43.797 --> 00:22:44.628
<v Regina>Lobster.</v>

620
00:22:44.628 --> 00:22:45.907
<v ->Blood lobsters.</v>

621
00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:47.588
Exactly, with like blisters on their back,

622
00:22:47.588 --> 00:22:48.869
and we're going, "Oh my God."

623
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:50.208
<v Regina>Yeah, that's obviously unwise.</v>

624
00:22:50.208 --> 00:22:51.068
<v ->Protest these people.</v>

625
00:22:51.068 --> 00:22:52.847
But you know, we crave this thing

626
00:22:52.847 --> 00:22:55.409
that we've gotten so far away from, sunlight.

627
00:22:55.409 --> 00:22:58.709
And it's a matter of learning what's the right balance

628
00:22:58.709 --> 00:23:00.989
for our unique, constitutional type?

629
00:23:00.989 --> 00:23:02.919
And skin type, and eye color type.

630
00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:04.458
<v Regina>And they often say going out in the morning,</v>

631
00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:06.718
for example, going out at eight, nine o'clock

632
00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.889
in the morning and just going for a nice, little walk.

633
00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:09.499
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

634
00:23:09.499 --> 00:23:10.717
<v Regina>Or even to just sit in the sun</v>

635
00:23:10.717 --> 00:23:11.416
and read the paper--

636
00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:11.951
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

637
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:12.521
<v Regina>Is a good way to do it.</v>

638
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:14.690
You're not in the intense rays of the day,

639
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.329
and after four in the afternoon even.

640
00:23:16.329 --> 00:23:17.207
<v ->Exactly.</v>

641
00:23:17.207 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Regina>So I mean there are ways we can do this</v>

642
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.448
if we make it a priority--

643
00:23:19.448 --> 00:23:19.989
<v ->Right.</v>

644
00:23:19.989 --> 00:23:22.250
<v Regina>At no risk to ourselves and all gain, right?</v>

645
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.470
<v ->Absolutely, all gain.</v>

646
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:24.389
<v Regina>Well now what about the subject</v>

647
00:23:24.389 --> 00:23:27.909
of solar gazing, because that's actually starting to

648
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:30.189
rise up again, another ancient technology

649
00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:31.510
and ancient knowledge.

650
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.710
<v ->Well I think that piggy backs on what you're saying</v>

651
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.748
that if we can get the sunlight just as the sun

652
00:23:37.748 --> 00:23:39.147
comes over the horizon,

653
00:23:39.147 --> 00:23:41.688
when it can be filtered through the most atmosphere

654
00:23:41.688 --> 00:23:45.868
we'll get the benefits without the detriments of sunlight.

655
00:23:45.868 --> 00:23:48.270
And solar gazing, what little I've read about it,

656
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.848
has to do with eyes open, looking at the horizon

657
00:23:51.848 --> 00:23:53.487
just as the sun is coming up.

658
00:23:53.487 --> 00:23:55.408
Now, when the sun is up like

659
00:23:55.408 --> 00:23:57.968
10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in the morning,

660
00:23:57.968 --> 00:24:00.247
that same quantity of light would actually burn the retina

661
00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:02.486
and would be dangerous and people would be blind.

662
00:24:02.486 --> 00:24:05.507
But, you know, that amount of brightness of light

663
00:24:05.507 --> 00:24:09.007
is actually the brightness of light that we use in a,

664
00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:11.727
I have a box behind me here that we use to treat

665
00:24:11.727 --> 00:24:12.882
winter depression.

666
00:24:12.882 --> 00:24:14.503
It's 10,000 lux of light.

667
00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:17.385
It's a certain brightness of light that has to do with

668
00:24:17.385 --> 00:24:20.645
the brightness of light as it comes over the horizon

669
00:24:20.645 --> 00:24:22.045
in the morning.

670
00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:24.745
So there's actually some really great studies to show,

671
00:24:24.745 --> 00:24:26.043
talking about depression,

672
00:24:26.043 --> 00:24:29.445
that people who get out for a half hour of exercise a day

673
00:24:29.445 --> 00:24:31.005
who are deeply depressed,

674
00:24:31.005 --> 00:24:35.147
their mood will increase as much or actually greater

675
00:24:35.147 --> 00:24:38.196
than working with an anti-depressant.

676
00:24:38.196 --> 00:24:40.177
Now some people may need anti-depressants,

677
00:24:40.177 --> 00:24:42.937
but if you're not having the great therapeutic effect

678
00:24:42.937 --> 00:24:44.377
with an anti-depressant,

679
00:24:44.377 --> 00:24:46.576
why not try exercise and sunlight?

680
00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:48.975
If you're living in a place where you can't get out

681
00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:51.717
because of the coldness or maybe it's too dark,

682
00:24:51.717 --> 00:24:54.334
you can supplement the indoor lighting you have

683
00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:57.275
with what we call a bright light or broad spectrum

684
00:24:57.275 --> 00:24:58.635
light box.

685
00:24:58.635 --> 00:24:59.857
Exercise in front of it.

686
00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:01.396
Eat your breakfast in front of it.

687
00:25:01.396 --> 00:25:04.257
Just to get a little Vitamin L as I call it.

688
00:25:04.257 --> 00:25:04.893
<v Regina>Right.</v>

689
00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:06.655
<v ->Light through the eyes, which will jump start</v>

690
00:25:06.655 --> 00:25:07.615
the brain chemistry,

691
00:25:07.615 --> 00:25:10.495
make you feel a lot more alert, more positive,

692
00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:13.933
and actually synchronize your 24 hour rhythm

693
00:25:13.933 --> 00:25:16.974
to be alert during the day and falling asleep

694
00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:19.834
at the appropriate time at night so--

695
00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:20.695
<v Regina>Right.</v>

696
00:25:20.695 --> 00:25:21.774
Well, that makes total sense.

697
00:25:21.774 --> 00:25:25.734
How about, are the units now made small enough

698
00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:27.270
and portable enough where you can even have them

699
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.411
in your work space?

700
00:25:28.411 --> 00:25:29.070
<v ->Yes.</v>

701
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.391
<v Regina>In terms of the broad spectrum?</v>

702
00:25:30.391 --> 00:25:31.212
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

703
00:25:31.212 --> 00:25:32.072
<v Regina>Mhmm, full spectrum light.</v>

704
00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:33.570
<v ->Yeah, there's many, many companies</v>

705
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.848
that make these real portable, probably six inches

706
00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:40.590
wide by maybe a foot, foot and a half tall.

707
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.049
And they're a nice supplement if you have to be indoors

708
00:25:43.049 --> 00:25:44.730
in a dark cubby, God forbid,

709
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.628
but we all have to make money.

710
00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:47.529
<v Regina>Right, exactly.</v>

711
00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:49.430
But that seems like a wonderful antidote to it.

712
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.089
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

713
00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:51.748
And there's actually light visors,

714
00:25:51.748 --> 00:25:53.149
which look like baseball caps

715
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:55.889
that they're using a particular color of light.

716
00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.769
It's very interesting now, Regina,

717
00:25:57.769 --> 00:26:00.288
that they're using a particular color of blue

718
00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:02.810
to blue green, I can show you that device

719
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.649
if you're interested--

720
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:04.287
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

721
00:26:04.287 --> 00:26:08.369
<v ->But the color that seems to suppress Melatonin</v>

722
00:26:08.369 --> 00:26:10.870
and Melatonin's the sleep hormone,

723
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.347
and essentially people who have winter depression

724
00:26:13.347 --> 00:26:16.579
are a little foggy or chronically depressed in the winter.

725
00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:19.519
This particular frequency of blue switches off

726
00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:22.137
the brain chemistry or the sleep chemistry

727
00:26:22.137 --> 00:26:24.077
so they can feel more alert.

728
00:26:24.077 --> 00:26:26.797
So there's experimenting instead of using white,

729
00:26:26.797 --> 00:26:29.098
bright light, they're using a dimmer quantity

730
00:26:29.098 --> 00:26:30.277
of this blue-green light

731
00:26:30.277 --> 00:26:33.370
that seems to drive the whole circadian rhythm.

732
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.210
Fascinating.

733
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:34.951
<v Regina>Very interesting.</v>

734
00:26:34.951 --> 00:26:35.520
<v ->Yeah.</v>

735
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.066
<v Regina>So many cool devices out there right now.</v>

736
00:26:37.066 --> 00:26:37.666
<v ->Yeah.</v>

737
00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:38.974
<v Regina>I saw another one a friend of mine has,</v>

738
00:26:38.974 --> 00:26:41.494
I think they call it the mind spa.

739
00:26:41.494 --> 00:26:42.053
<v ->Wow.</v>

740
00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:44.313
<v Regina>It's the little device that has both tone</v>

741
00:26:44.313 --> 00:26:46.853
and it also comes across the eyes like a visor,

742
00:26:46.853 --> 00:26:48.653
and you can set it on programs for different

743
00:26:48.653 --> 00:26:50.193
strobing rhythms and colors.

744
00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:54.053
And I mean, the technology has become much more

745
00:26:54.053 --> 00:26:55.253
affordable.

746
00:26:55.253 --> 00:26:56.114
<v ->And user friendly.</v>

747
00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:56.851
<v Regina>And more sophisticated,</v>

748
00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:58.991
and user friendly, and personally,

749
00:26:58.991 --> 00:27:02.092
in fact I think to myself,

750
00:27:02.092 --> 00:27:04.390
"I knew about all this and was you know

751
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.169
"very involved in the color therapy 20 years ago,

752
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:07.968
"so why haven't I been doing it?"

753
00:27:07.968 --> 00:27:08.628
<v ->Right.</v>

754
00:27:08.628 --> 00:27:10.489
<v Regina>I mean I go out for walks in the morning</v>

755
00:27:10.489 --> 00:27:11.827
and that so I get the sunlight,

756
00:27:11.827 --> 00:27:14.508
but the joy of working with these colors

757
00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:16.868
is really profound I find.

758
00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:17.437
<v ->Profound.</v>

759
00:27:17.437 --> 00:27:18.706
<v Regina>I mean you can literally switch your mood</v>

760
00:27:18.706 --> 00:27:19.706
like that, right?

761
00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:20.665
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

762
00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:21.784
<v Regina>So are there more color devices</v>

763
00:27:21.784 --> 00:27:23.345
where you can do your own little gels

764
00:27:23.345 --> 00:27:26.051
and kind of regulate your own experience

765
00:27:26.051 --> 00:27:27.650
at home more these days?

766
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.430
<v ->I think they're coming.</v>

767
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.649
The devices that you talk about,

768
00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:32.449
just to go back, the brain wave entrainment.

769
00:27:32.449 --> 00:27:34.709
You can take someone who hasn't meditated

770
00:27:34.709 --> 00:27:37.110
a day in their life and put on a pair of goggles

771
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.299
and headphones that will slow their brain waves down

772
00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:42.245
from their normal chattery brain wave

773
00:27:42.245 --> 00:27:44.505
down to deep levels of meditation.

774
00:27:44.505 --> 00:27:47.985
Or this other client I had who was an Iraq War

775
00:27:47.985 --> 00:27:49.085
Colonel.

776
00:27:49.085 --> 00:27:51.303
He was over there and you know in a place

777
00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:53.843
where jets were landing every two hours,

778
00:27:53.843 --> 00:27:56.043
and he had a sleep problem.

779
00:27:56.043 --> 00:27:58.003
But he took this light and sound device,

780
00:27:58.003 --> 00:27:59.283
put it on a sleep program,

781
00:27:59.283 --> 00:28:01.944
and was able to sleep his four hours a night.

782
00:28:01.944 --> 00:28:04.382
You know his night shift and go deep.

783
00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:08.323
So these things can really profoundly override

784
00:28:08.323 --> 00:28:10.404
a lot of our, you know trauma.

785
00:28:10.404 --> 00:28:12.784
God forbid, you know there's Iraq War veterans

786
00:28:12.784 --> 00:28:13.864
that are gonna come back,

787
00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:16.062
there's 200,000 people I believe

788
00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:18.325
who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan,

789
00:28:18.325 --> 00:28:21.357
will have various levels of post-traumatic stress disorder

790
00:28:21.357 --> 00:28:22.716
and they can be helped.

791
00:28:22.716 --> 00:28:23.356
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

792
00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:24.715
<v ->And their families can be helped</v>

793
00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:26.875
using these strobing colored light devices.

794
00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:29.216
There are growing,

795
00:28:29.216 --> 00:28:31.396
there's a revolution in colored lighting,

796
00:28:31.396 --> 00:28:32.855
with light emitting diodes.

797
00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:35.796
Before we had to use an incandescent bulb

798
00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:38.196
that would mimic sunlight.

799
00:28:38.196 --> 00:28:40.176
And light emitting diodes now

800
00:28:40.176 --> 00:28:42.137
will probably replace fluorescents.

801
00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:43.514
I imagine in about five years.

802
00:28:43.514 --> 00:28:44.295
<v Regina>OK.</v>

803
00:28:44.295 --> 00:28:45.313
<v ->They're energy efficient.</v>

804
00:28:45.313 --> 00:28:49.116
<v ->Probably as great in energy efficiency as compact</v>

805
00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:50.455
fluorescents.

806
00:28:50.455 --> 00:28:54.674
But you can produce any color of the visible spectrum,

807
00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:56.856
and actually in very narrow slices.

808
00:28:56.856 --> 00:28:59.282
And what we've found about these very narrow

809
00:28:59.282 --> 00:29:01.641
or very monochromatic slices of light,

810
00:29:01.641 --> 00:29:03.002
about ten nano-meters,

811
00:29:03.002 --> 00:29:04.781
they have profound effects,

812
00:29:04.781 --> 00:29:06.022
actually quicker effects,

813
00:29:06.022 --> 00:29:09.841
more bodily-oriented effects,

814
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:11.362
more emotional effects,

815
00:29:11.362 --> 00:29:14.521
faster and deeper than broader spectrum.

816
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:16.681
For example, with green there might be

817
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:18.381
70 different greens.

818
00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:19.081
<v Regina>Right.</v>

819
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:21.102
<v ->Whereas, if you take a particular, narrow slice,</v>

820
00:29:21.102 --> 00:29:23.882
you can go quite a bit deeper faster.

821
00:29:23.882 --> 00:29:25.802
And green is a color I use a lot

822
00:29:25.802 --> 00:29:28.242
for people who have grief issues.

823
00:29:28.242 --> 00:29:31.456
They feel sadness or abandonment issues.

824
00:29:31.456 --> 00:29:32.636
Issues of the heart.

825
00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:33.277
<v Regina>Right.</v>

826
00:29:33.277 --> 00:29:34.815
<v ->And it helps them get in touch with that,</v>

827
00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:36.275
to grieve the losses,

828
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:39.616
and essentially open their heart to themselves

829
00:29:39.616 --> 00:29:40.535
and life again.

830
00:29:40.535 --> 00:29:41.235
<v Regina>Right.</v>

831
00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:42.215
<v ->So that's really gratifying.</v>

832
00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:44.154
And they're coming slowly.

833
00:29:44.154 --> 00:29:47.077
But people, I think because it's light,

834
00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:48.897
we're like fish looking at water.

835
00:29:48.897 --> 00:29:49.817
You know, we think,

836
00:29:49.817 --> 00:29:51.617
we take light and color for granted.

837
00:29:51.617 --> 00:29:53.117
And we think, "Oh, that's new age

838
00:29:53.117 --> 00:29:54.140
"or it's not very powerful."

839
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:54.959
<v Regina>It's too subtle.</v>

840
00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:55.642
<v ->It's too subtle.</v>

841
00:29:55.642 --> 00:29:58.303
But actually, it's very physiological.

842
00:29:58.303 --> 00:29:59.162
<v Regina>Right.</v>

843
00:29:59.162 --> 00:30:00.283
<v ->When you're using a bright light source</v>

844
00:30:00.283 --> 00:30:03.503
or even a color, I can show you on an EEG

845
00:30:03.503 --> 00:30:05.922
just by putting on a pair of colored glasses,

846
00:30:05.922 --> 00:30:08.343
your brain waves will change like that.

847
00:30:08.343 --> 00:30:11.483
And the first time I saw this, I was astounded.

848
00:30:11.483 --> 00:30:13.683
You know I've been working with color for almost 20 years

849
00:30:13.683 --> 00:30:16.583
and a friend of ours has a EEG device,

850
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:19.303
and we were playing with different colored glasses

851
00:30:19.303 --> 00:30:20.263
through the spectrum.

852
00:30:20.263 --> 00:30:22.964
And you saw the brain waves change instantly.

853
00:30:22.964 --> 00:30:25.183
The lenses were shifted.

854
00:30:25.183 --> 00:30:25.724
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

855
00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:28.744
<v ->So, you can create states of mental clarity</v>

856
00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:30.504
or states of relaxation,

857
00:30:30.504 --> 00:30:34.105
and this works great for people with anxiety disorders

858
00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:37.105
or people like myself, we have trouble concentrating

859
00:30:37.105 --> 00:30:39.185
after too many dark days in the winter.

860
00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:39.865
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

861
00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:42.454
<v ->So we wear the yellow glasses to give me that sort of</v>

862
00:30:42.454 --> 00:30:45.454
visual caffeine, that visual cappuccino.

863
00:30:45.454 --> 00:30:46.194
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

864
00:30:46.194 --> 00:30:47.194
<v ->Or, you know,</v>

865
00:30:47.194 --> 00:30:49.993
the other side to slow down, calm down.

866
00:30:49.993 --> 00:30:53.633
If someone is like terrified of having like dental surgery

867
00:30:53.633 --> 00:30:56.774
or dental anxiety, you can put on a pair

868
00:30:56.774 --> 00:31:00.214
of very dark blue glasses that cut down the amount of light

869
00:31:00.214 --> 00:31:02.294
but the blue is so calming and relaxing,

870
00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:04.175
that they can go through the procedure

871
00:31:04.175 --> 00:31:06.615
with a fraction of the Novocain that they would typically

872
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:07.773
use without it.

873
00:31:07.773 --> 00:31:08.575
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

874
00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:11.954
<v ->So I like sending my clients home with colored glasses</v>

875
00:31:11.954 --> 00:31:12.814
to play with.

876
00:31:12.814 --> 00:31:15.794
Not only their comfort color but also their issue color

877
00:31:15.794 --> 00:31:17.814
that they don't want to deal with,

878
00:31:17.814 --> 00:31:21.314
and help them gradually get exposed

879
00:31:21.314 --> 00:31:24.034
to those aspects of their life

880
00:31:24.034 --> 00:31:25.454
that they're pushing away,

881
00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:27.535
become more comfortable with sitting with it

882
00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:28.594
and talking about it,

883
00:31:28.594 --> 00:31:31.135
journal writing about it, for example.

884
00:31:31.135 --> 00:31:34.253
<v Regina>Any other interesting studies or breakthroughs</v>

885
00:31:34.253 --> 00:31:36.793
that have come about as of late?

886
00:31:36.793 --> 00:31:39.333
<v ->Huge, you know we're still thinking</v>

887
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:41.554
even mainstream psychiatrists, doctors,

888
00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:43.516
psychologists, mental health workers,

889
00:31:43.516 --> 00:31:45.554
that light is something new.

890
00:31:45.554 --> 00:31:48.936
You know, and there's been 25 really great years

891
00:31:48.936 --> 00:31:51.836
of the most highly controlled research on light,

892
00:31:51.836 --> 00:31:53.954
and when you compare light, for example,

893
00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:57.315
let's take one class of drugs, the anti-depressants.

894
00:31:57.315 --> 00:32:00.674
Light will give you a faster anti-depressant response

895
00:32:00.674 --> 00:32:02.993
and a greater magnitude of response

896
00:32:02.993 --> 00:32:04.855
without medication.

897
00:32:04.855 --> 00:32:06.395
But you can use it even for people

898
00:32:06.395 --> 00:32:09.274
who are taking medication and aren't responsive,

899
00:32:09.274 --> 00:32:11.714
because light is sort of natural Prozac,

900
00:32:11.714 --> 00:32:13.534
and increases the same brain chemistry

901
00:32:13.534 --> 00:32:15.454
as the anti-depressants.

902
00:32:15.454 --> 00:32:17.234
You can get a synergistic effect

903
00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:19.894
so I'm very much into empowering people

904
00:32:19.894 --> 00:32:23.374
to explore what they can do to make themselves

905
00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:25.694
feel and function better.

906
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:27.654
'Cause life is a performance sport.

907
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:30.155
<v Regina>Oh, we've gotta winter ahead here.</v>

908
00:32:30.155 --> 00:32:32.434
So, what would you say for people who are living

909
00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:35.274
in cold, dank, dark climates then

910
00:32:35.274 --> 00:32:37.534
instead of just espresso and baked goods?

911
00:32:37.534 --> 00:32:38.314
(laughing)

912
00:32:38.314 --> 00:32:39.113
And Prozac?

913
00:32:39.113 --> 00:32:40.974
<v ->Reaching for that extra cookie at four in the afternoon,</v>

914
00:32:40.974 --> 00:32:42.005
and the double cappuccino.

915
00:32:42.005 --> 00:32:43.005
<v Regina>Exactly, get that serotonin up.</v>

916
00:32:43.005 --> 00:32:43.573
<v ->Yeah.</v>

917
00:32:43.573 --> 00:32:44.856
<v Regina>How would you do it?</v>

918
00:32:44.856 --> 00:32:46.176
How would you have 'em manage it at home?

919
00:32:46.176 --> 00:32:48.716
Well, you know exposure,

920
00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.616
your advice about exposure.

921
00:32:50.616 --> 00:32:52.804
Your early morning light, if that's possible.

922
00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.524
You know through exercise, getting out.

923
00:32:54.524 --> 00:32:57.844
If not, people can have these bright white light boxes

924
00:32:57.844 --> 00:33:00.044
in front of their favorite exercise,

925
00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:03.125
you know, getting on the stationary bicycle

926
00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:04.964
or the cross country machine.

927
00:33:04.964 --> 00:33:06.224
That's very helpful.

928
00:33:06.224 --> 00:33:07.704
Or even eating your cereal,

929
00:33:07.704 --> 00:33:10.644
if you can't exercise, eating your cereal or reading

930
00:33:10.644 --> 00:33:13.364
a book with having the bright light box in front of you

931
00:33:13.364 --> 00:33:15.983
and just, see, you don't have to look directly

932
00:33:15.983 --> 00:33:16.883
at the light.

933
00:33:16.883 --> 00:33:19.163
Just taking it in through the periphery

934
00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:21.664
is enough to profoundly change your brain chemistry.

935
00:33:21.664 --> 00:33:22.463
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

936
00:33:22.463 --> 00:33:24.303
<v ->And there's another thing that's very cool</v>

937
00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:27.143
for those people that have to get up on these dark, cold

938
00:33:27.143 --> 00:33:28.983
winter mornings and may not,

939
00:33:28.983 --> 00:33:30.842
you know they're great in the spring and summer

940
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.582
when the sun's coming up at six o'clock,

941
00:33:32.582 --> 00:33:34.762
but in the winter when the sun doesn't come up

942
00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:36.923
until like eight o'clock, if it does,

943
00:33:36.923 --> 00:33:39.982
you can have these light alarm clocks.

944
00:33:39.982 --> 00:33:42.122
It's called dawn simulation--

945
00:33:42.122 --> 00:33:43.242
<v Regina>Oh interesting,</v>

946
00:33:43.242 --> 00:33:44.123
I haven't heard of these.

947
00:33:44.123 --> 00:33:44.822
<v ->It's great.</v>

948
00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:45.778
It's very powerful.

949
00:33:45.778 --> 00:33:48.816
That our eyelids are opaque when we close them,

950
00:33:48.816 --> 00:33:51.618
we actually take in a certain amount of light

951
00:33:51.618 --> 00:33:53.179
through our closed eyelids.

952
00:33:53.179 --> 00:33:55.505
And you can take your favorite bedside lamp

953
00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:58.443
and essentially a little computer called the dawn simulator

954
00:33:58.443 --> 00:34:00.845
will ramp up an hour or two hours before

955
00:34:00.845 --> 00:34:02.567
you're to get up in the morning.

956
00:34:02.567 --> 00:34:03.386
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

957
00:34:03.386 --> 00:34:04.847
<v ->And gradually get brighter and brighter.</v>

958
00:34:04.847 --> 00:34:06.646
It just sort of mimics sunrise.

959
00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:08.927
And just that little bit of light through your closed

960
00:34:08.927 --> 00:34:10.867
eyelid is enough to suppress your brain,

961
00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:12.808
excuse me, your sleep chemistry,

962
00:34:12.808 --> 00:34:15.368
so you wake up feeling alert and refreshed.

963
00:34:15.368 --> 00:34:17.646
Now I'm one of these people that used to need

964
00:34:17.646 --> 00:34:19.008
like two cups of coffee in the morning

965
00:34:19.008 --> 00:34:21.447
before I could even hold a conversation.

966
00:34:21.447 --> 00:34:23.678
But the first time I tried the dawn simulator,

967
00:34:23.678 --> 00:34:27.375
I woke up right on time without any auditory alarm,

968
00:34:27.375 --> 00:34:30.959
feeling alert, like it was two or three hours later.

969
00:34:30.959 --> 00:34:33.577
'Cause my brain chemistry was in sync,

970
00:34:33.577 --> 00:34:36.436
and the thing about today is that we have sort of

971
00:34:36.436 --> 00:34:37.777
chronic jet lag.

972
00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:40.936
We're out of sync with our circadian rhythms

973
00:34:40.936 --> 00:34:44.153
and their current demands of our culture.

974
00:34:44.153 --> 00:34:46.872
And part of it is by watching TV too late at night,

975
00:34:46.872 --> 00:34:48.833
too much internet stimulation,

976
00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:51.333
too much indoor light at night,

977
00:34:51.333 --> 00:34:54.353
which may be suppressing your immune system.

978
00:34:54.353 --> 00:34:56.492
That's one of the things that they're looking at

979
00:34:56.492 --> 00:34:58.572
in this Harvard nurses study

980
00:34:58.572 --> 00:35:01.293
with nurses who've had breast cancer.

981
00:35:01.293 --> 00:35:04.234
I think it was a 20 year study and they're looking at

982
00:35:04.234 --> 00:35:07.416
exposure to bright, artificial light.

983
00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:08.775
Is it fluorescent?

984
00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:09.935
We don't know,

985
00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:13.334
but it's bright light at night suppressing Melatonin.

986
00:35:13.334 --> 00:35:15.634
Melatonin is not only our sleep chemistry,

987
00:35:15.634 --> 00:35:18.315
it's also the most powerful antioxidant in the body.

988
00:35:18.315 --> 00:35:19.073
<v Regina>Right.</v>

989
00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:21.794
<v ->So, do we want to be suppressing it as much</v>

990
00:35:21.794 --> 00:35:22.835
as we're doing?

991
00:35:22.835 --> 00:35:25.475
You know, do we want our houses to be like Walmart?

992
00:35:25.475 --> 00:35:28.034
You can go into Walmart at any place in the country,

993
00:35:28.034 --> 00:35:31.435
two o'clock in the morning and it's lighted

994
00:35:31.435 --> 00:35:32.575
like a football field.

995
00:35:32.575 --> 00:35:33.235
<v Regina>Right.</v>

996
00:35:33.235 --> 00:35:36.054
<v ->Well that's not good for us who need down time.</v>

997
00:35:36.054 --> 00:35:38.514
You know we need to be alert and performing

998
00:35:38.514 --> 00:35:41.275
and full of vitality but we also need to go the other way

999
00:35:41.275 --> 00:35:44.974
to relax and go deeply, and to have that deep

1000
00:35:44.974 --> 00:35:47.495
delta wave sleep that is restorative.

1001
00:35:47.495 --> 00:35:49.656
<v Regina>So we have that dawn stimulator</v>

1002
00:35:49.656 --> 00:35:50.776
or whatever it's called,

1003
00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:53.796
give us maybe just two or three of your favorite devices

1004
00:35:53.796 --> 00:35:56.395
so people can start doing online searches too.

1005
00:35:56.395 --> 00:35:57.135
<v ->Good, yeah.</v>

1006
00:35:57.135 --> 00:35:59.377
Broad spectrum light boxes.

1007
00:35:59.377 --> 00:36:00.174
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:36:00.174 --> 00:36:02.595
<v ->I won't mention any brand names.</v>

1009
00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:03.756
<v Regina>Yeah, we don't have to talk about--</v>

1010
00:36:03.756 --> 00:36:04.315
Yeah.

1011
00:36:04.315 --> 00:36:06.393
<v ->That's very helpful.</v>

1012
00:36:06.393 --> 00:36:07.878
Color therapy eye ware.

1013
00:36:07.878 --> 00:36:08.938
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

1014
00:36:09.718 --> 00:36:11.125
<v ->'Cause you can do with color</v>

1015
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:14.044
what you can do with psychotherapy,

1016
00:36:14.044 --> 00:36:15.805
but it's more self care.

1017
00:36:15.805 --> 00:36:16.485
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1018
00:36:16.485 --> 00:36:18.442
<v ->To create states of relaxation or alertness</v>

1019
00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.982
just generally.

1020
00:36:22.922 --> 00:36:25.281
What's the, the dawn simulators.

1021
00:36:25.281 --> 00:36:26.521
<v Regina>Dawn simulator, OK.</v>

1022
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:28.682
<v ->There are several companies that make dawn simulators.</v>

1023
00:36:28.682 --> 00:36:32.102
And, the light visor.

1024
00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:33.022
<v Regina>The light visor.</v>

1025
00:36:33.022 --> 00:36:34.061
That's interesting, yeah.

1026
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:35.482
<v ->Yeah, so you can use either the blue-green</v>

1027
00:36:35.482 --> 00:36:37.823
which seems to suppress Melatonin

1028
00:36:37.823 --> 00:36:40.223
which is the sleep chemistry for winter depression.

1029
00:36:40.223 --> 00:36:42.573
It's seems to be very good for s-a-d.

1030
00:36:42.573 --> 00:36:46.134
Or a broader spectrum white bulb they use.

1031
00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:46.954
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1032
00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:48.854
Great, well the tools are there.

1033
00:36:48.854 --> 00:36:49.675
<v ->The tools are there.</v>

1034
00:36:49.675 --> 00:36:51.931
<v Regina>Just up to us now and a little bit of education</v>

1035
00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:53.652
and I thank you so much for your time.

1036
00:36:53.652 --> 00:36:55.871
I think this is a subject that has been

1037
00:36:55.871 --> 00:36:57.252
much, much overlooked.

1038
00:36:57.252 --> 00:36:58.672
Even by us.

1039
00:36:58.672 --> 00:36:59.149
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1040
00:36:59.149 --> 00:36:59.919
<v Regina>And I know better.</v>

1041
00:36:59.919 --> 00:37:00.339
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1042
00:37:00.339 --> 00:37:01.038
(laughing)

1043
00:37:01.038 --> 00:37:01.589
Thanks Regina.

1044
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:02.619
<v Regina>Thank you for your time, Brian.</v>

1045
00:37:02.619 --> 00:37:03.759
<v ->Yeah. Great.</v>

1046
00:37:05.399 --> 00:37:07.967
<v ->If the subject intrigues you as it did me,</v>

1047
00:37:07.967 --> 00:37:10.989
you can go to his website at lightyearsahead.net.

1048
00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:13.188
He has great information and tools to begin

1049
00:37:13.188 --> 00:37:15.067
your journey into the world of color,

1050
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:17.387
which I cannot recommend highly enough.

1051
00:37:17.387 --> 00:37:19.546
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1052
00:37:19.546 --> 00:37:23.937
(light drumming, slow orchestral music)
