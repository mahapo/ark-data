00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:03.371
<v ->The motto of Richard Hoaglund's website is</v>

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:06.121
to go boldly where someone has gone before.

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:08.808
This tongue-in-cheek slogan is referring to what appeared

4
00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.068
to be the remnants from an ancient civilization

5
00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:12.874
on the planet Mars.

6
00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:15.385
Richard also suggests that much of what we know as

7
00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:18.215
the US-Soviet accomplishments in space

8
00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:20.665
are simply a camouflage for much deeper

9
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:22.441
and more profound truths.

10
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.721
Truths that we need to take a look at today

11
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.906
to avoid a potentially similar fate as those civilizations

12
00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:29.963
that he says have disappeared.

13
00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.592 line:15% 
(gentle music)

14
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.696
<v Voiceover>For the last couple of decades,</v>

15
00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:42.006
you've been spending a good amount of time

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.992
looking at the planet Mars

17
00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:46.297
and looking at the structures on Mars,

18
00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:49.547
and deciphering through scientific process

19
00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:51.537
what this could mean, and not only that,

20
00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:54.367
the geometry between the famous face

21
00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.957
and other structures that are there as well.

22
00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.248
So, let's just launch in.

23
00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:03.098
What are you coming to now on this?

24
00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:06.289
<v ->In terms of this conference,</v>

25
00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.919
and we're at a processional conference,

26
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:09.521
ancient wisdom.

27
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.056
To me, the elegance is how the work I started

28
00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:14.359
25, 30 years ago,

29
00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.261
trying to figure out A, were the ruins real?

30
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:18.964
And then B, once we figured out there was

31
00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:21.132
a geometry and a mathematics,

32
00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:24.268
that they were real and there was a message.

33
00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:25.737
And then trying to figure out what the message

34
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:29.240
was supposed to tell us, is to see the conversions

35
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.743
between that mathematical message

36
00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:33.945
and the whole theme of procession.

37
00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:36.982
Because it turns out that the guys who were on Mars,

38
00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:37.682
whoever they were.

39
00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:40.618
In some of my models, I say it was probably us,

40
00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:42.253
but I'm not stuck on that.

41
00:01:42.253 --> 00:01:44.924
It could easily be dissuaded that it's not us

42
00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:47.109
or our great, great, great, great grandmothers.

43
00:01:48.227 --> 00:01:50.295
They had something profound to say

44
00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:52.614
in the form of this exquisite physics.

45
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:57.702
It turns out that that physics is central,

46
00:01:57.702 --> 00:01:59.771
is absolutely central,

47
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:02.975
to figuring out the reasons for the processional

48
00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:04.876
slash Yuga cycle,

49
00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:07.478
and the drivers, how it works.

50
00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:11.750
Why consciousness appears to rise and fall in this 26,000,

51
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.752
24,000 year period.

52
00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:17.288
And why we're here.

53
00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:20.057
When I started this almost 30 years ago,

54
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:22.227
I would never have imagined that we would get

55
00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:24.628
to that place where we actually can make

56
00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:28.165
coherent dot connections

57
00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:31.970
between very disparate scientific disciplines.

58
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.373
From ethnology, archaeology,

59
00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:37.675
physics, torsion physics

60
00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:39.076
which is the cutting edge of some of the work

61
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.846
I talk about now,

62
00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:42.313
that it will all come together.

63
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:43.983
The only way that can happen is if you start

64
00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:46.151
from a place of realism.

65
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:47.220
In other words,

66
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.654
there had to really be ruins all along

67
00:02:49.654 --> 00:02:52.256
for the mathematics that we've learned from the ruins

68
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:55.126
to turn out to have real world connections

69
00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:56.761
in the here and now.

70
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:57.896
<v Voicover>And what you talked about,</v>

71
00:02:57.896 --> 00:02:59.831
you never thought we'd get here.

72
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.989
Another point you made is

73
00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.835
but where did they go? (laughs)

74
00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:04.803
What happened to them?

75
00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:06.972
Now, that's a whole other story, right?

76
00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:08.063
You have ruins.

77
00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:12.177
<v ->Starting with this planet,</v>

78
00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:14.412
we're looking at a history of cultures

79
00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:18.282
that rise and fall, create magnificent stuff,

80
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:20.586
and then leave stage right.

81
00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:22.654
And we have very little evidence of who they were,

82
00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:24.590
what they thought, what they believed,

83
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.658
why they disappeared.

84
00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:30.496
And it now looks like we can extend that set of mysteries

85
00:03:30.496 --> 00:03:32.163
to other worlds.

86
00:03:32.163 --> 00:03:34.567
The first thing I noticed in looking at the Mars data

87
00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:37.469
is those guys are no longer here.

88
00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.504
When I'm looking at stuff we found on the moon,

89
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:40.772
and we've found some pretty amazing,

90
00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:42.741
astonishing stuff recently,

91
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:45.242
they're no longer there, why?

92
00:03:45.242 --> 00:03:48.681
Why does there seem to be this finite lifetime

93
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.417
for even the most extraodinary civilizations and cultures?

94
00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:54.084
Possible answer:

95
00:03:54.084 --> 00:03:58.255
They're driven by the same processional Yugal cycle

96
00:03:58.255 --> 00:04:02.560
that caused cultures to appear and disappear on this planet.

97
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.497
And it behooves us, I would think, if we would like

98
00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:08.100
to maintain our longevity and get better

99
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.569
and get rid of things like wars and strife and conflict

100
00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.240
and live on Earth the way someone intended we should live.

101
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.443
It would behoove us, I think, to learn the lessons

102
00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:21.812
of why even these incredibly advanced cultures,

103
00:04:21.812 --> 00:04:25.382
the progenitors of whoever we're seeing

104
00:04:25.382 --> 00:04:29.288
in this set of ruins on Mars and the moon and other places,

105
00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:30.756
are no longer here.

106
00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:33.492
If we don't learn that lesson and learn it soon

107
00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:35.961
as we have this run-up to a very important date

108
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:40.065
called 2012, then maybe we won't survive

109
00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.932
much longer either.

110
00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:44.769
And if it's within our power to figure out

111
00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.506
what we can do different, then it would be tragic

112
00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:52.459
if we did nothing and we stayed doing the same old thing.

113
00:04:53.378 --> 00:04:55.747
<v Voiceover>Well, not to pick an argument here,</v>

114
00:04:55.747 --> 00:04:58.782
but I did see on the internet a photo of Mars

115
00:04:58.782 --> 00:05:00.352
that had a Starbucks on it. (laughs)

116
00:05:00.352 --> 00:05:01.787
I don't know if you saw that one.

117
00:05:01.787 --> 00:05:03.655
<v ->I missed that, I missed that.</v>

118
00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:05.024
<v Voiceover>It was going around about a year ago,</v>

119
00:05:05.024 --> 00:05:07.225
but anyways speaking of great structures,

120
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:08.426
one of the things you were talking about

121
00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:11.628
is this particular 19.5 degrees north

122
00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:15.234
and how many great structures geometrically

123
00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:18.636
are laid out at 19.5 degrees north.

124
00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:20.105
What is the significance of that?

125
00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:22.090
Can go into that a little bit more.

126
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:24.543
<v ->Without the diagrams, it's hard for people</v>

127
00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:26.310
to envision this.

128
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.315
But in essence, we have, like the DaVinci Code,

129
00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:33.417
we found at Cydonia, a Cydonia code

130
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:35.020
which is not in language.

131
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.554
It's in mathematics and geometry.

132
00:05:36.554 --> 00:05:38.696
<v Voiceover>Cydonia Mars, not Sedona, Arizona.</v>

133
00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:40.024
<v ->Not Sedona, Arizona.</v>

134
00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:41.927
It's Cydonia on Mars.

135
00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:45.731
That code resolves down to basically

136
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.666
look to your tetrahedron.

137
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:50.302
A tetrahedron is a four-cornered, four-sided

138
00:05:50.302 --> 00:05:52.171
geometric figure,

139
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.673
and that kind of four structure, a standing wave pattern,

140
00:05:55.673 --> 00:05:57.509
not an actual tetrahedron,

141
00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.445
but an energy pattern that would look like that

142
00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:03.832
appears to be in every spinning object we can see.

143
00:06:04.784 --> 00:06:07.719
And what that model predicts is that energy should come up

144
00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.823
at certain key positions on stars or planets

145
00:06:11.823 --> 00:06:15.276
or other spinning bodies that embody this geometry.

146
00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:18.362
And when we look at the solar system,

147
00:06:18.362 --> 00:06:22.434
we find these energy upwellings all over the solar system.

148
00:06:22.434 --> 00:06:24.402
We find them on Earth, we find them on Venus,

149
00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:25.704
we find them on Mars.

150
00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:28.440
We find them on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

151
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.310
Whenever there is a fluid, gaseous dynamic situation

152
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.712
with energy churning around inside a rotating ball,

153
00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:36.942
a planet or a star,

154
00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:41.852
the peak latitude in sunspots is 19.5 degrees.

155
00:06:41.852 --> 00:06:45.222
So that says to me early on, and we're talking now

156
00:06:45.222 --> 00:06:47.825
in a decade or two, that this energy

157
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.293
that's appearing in these worlds,

158
00:06:49.293 --> 00:06:51.662
and we know that the outerworlds of the solar system

159
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.898
are actually radiating more energy into space

160
00:06:53.898 --> 00:06:56.101
that they're getting from the sun,

161
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:59.556
so the energy has to be appearing from some other place.

162
00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:03.108
In our model, that place is hyperspace.

163
00:07:03.108 --> 00:07:04.842
It's another dimension.

164
00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:07.379
It then turns out there's a body of literature going back

165
00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.646
something like a hundred years.

166
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:13.652
The founding fathers of all the great physics that we think

167
00:07:13.652 --> 00:07:17.188
we know, people like Maxwell and others,

168
00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:20.891
were looking at these hyperdimensional models

169
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.827
until something went wrong,

170
00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:24.862
and we went in a wrong direction.

171
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.697
So I've always maintained that what we're doing

172
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:29.066
is rediscovering these sciences.

173
00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:30.869
We're not discovering them.

174
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:34.172
And hooks into a lot of even more ancient texts

175
00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:37.275
and scriptures and archives and cuneiform

176
00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:39.343
and cylinder seals,

177
00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:42.213
that speak about this kind of energies

178
00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:44.998
and how they affect not only the planet,

179
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.485
but including consciousness itself.

180
00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:48.853
<v Voiceover>Well, that's the interest part.</v>

181
00:07:48.853 --> 00:07:51.422
I mean you have in India the tradition and the symbols

182
00:07:51.422 --> 00:07:54.058
of Sri Yantra which is one star tetrahedron

183
00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:55.628
buried into another into another.

184
00:07:55.628 --> 00:07:58.629
You have the work in modern times

185
00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:00.797
Drunvalo Melchizedek who talks about

186
00:08:00.797 --> 00:08:03.434
the star tetrahedrons and also the Sri Yantra,

187
00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:04.268
and flower of life,

188
00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:08.656
and so these images are being somehow recalled in math

189
00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:13.777
and being injected back into the spiritual sciences now?

190
00:08:13.777 --> 00:08:16.547
<v ->Well, they never really left.</v>

191
00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:19.817
It's just our Western tradition, our Western culture,

192
00:08:19.817 --> 00:08:21.852
has really divorced itself from any

193
00:08:21.852 --> 00:08:24.722
of that archival heritage material.

194
00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:27.559
As we're learning more at the physics level,

195
00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:29.460
as we're actually developing experiments

196
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.997
that can prove some of these concepts,

197
00:08:32.997 --> 00:08:34.599
can test them,

198
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:36.033
such as the accutron experiment

199
00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:37.198
I talk about it at Coral Castle.

200
00:08:37.198 --> 00:08:38.696
<v Voiceover>That is fascinating.</v>

201
00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:43.607
<v ->We're rediscovering the old maxim that it's all one.</v>

202
00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:46.510
There is no religion versus science.

203
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.581
It's all a gradation and, in the ideal world,

204
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:53.118
we never would have lost track of those connections.

205
00:08:53.118 --> 00:08:56.034
We wouldn't look with downcast eyes upon

206
00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:01.126
mainstream scientists or spiritually-inclined people.

207
00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:02.894
They are part of the continuum

208
00:09:02.894 --> 00:09:05.713
and you need both sets of eyes to understand the world.

209
00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:11.069
That's one of the extraordinary serendipitous benefits

210
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:13.704
of tripping over a set of ruins on another planet

211
00:09:13.704 --> 00:09:16.240
and then finding that they actually have practical

212
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.608
real world uses.

213
00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:19.143
<v Voiceover>And tripping over ruins here</v>

214
00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:22.847
where it appears we also forgot how to make helicopters

215
00:09:22.847 --> 00:09:25.349
and spaceships and tanks.

216
00:09:25.349 --> 00:09:27.519
Can you talk about that because I love that one.

217
00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:32.490
<v ->On the top lintel, a support lintel inside</v>

218
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.125
the Seti I Temple at Abydos,

219
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:39.531
there is this freeze which looks like a tableau

220
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:42.199
depicting very technological things,

221
00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:44.835
helicopters, submarines, tanks, stuff like that.

222
00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:46.071
<v Voiceover>And they're literal, they're exact.</v>

223
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:47.972
<v ->They appear to be exact analogs.</v>

224
00:09:47.972 --> 00:09:51.826
Now, the critics say that they're what's called a palimpsest

225
00:09:52.643 --> 00:09:56.880
meaning that they were hieroglyphs that were plastered over

226
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.551
and parts of the plaster has fallen off,

227
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:04.021
giving us the illusion that they encode these things.

228
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.957
<v Voiceover>Yeah, but they look so intact.</v>

229
00:10:05.957 --> 00:10:08.460
<v ->Well, they do and I've had close up pictures taken</v>

230
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.795
and they don't look like palimpsest to me.

231
00:10:10.795 --> 00:10:13.497
John West came up to me after my talk and he said,

232
00:10:13.497 --> 00:10:15.600
"You know, Dick, it was all great expect

233
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.845
"you gotta get rid of those slides.

234
00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:20.838
"Explain it's just a trick of light and shadow."

235
00:10:20.838 --> 00:10:24.475
And I'm kind of amused because he was quoting to me

236
00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:27.111
very uptight mainstream Egyptologists.

237
00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:27.978
<v Voiceover>Which he's not.</v>

238
00:10:27.978 --> 00:10:31.582
<v ->Which he's not, and John has been the object</v>

239
00:10:31.582 --> 00:10:34.652
of a lot of scorn from those very same people.

240
00:10:34.652 --> 00:10:38.355
And what it shows me is that everyone has their limits.

241
00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:42.127
John cannot believe, given all that he knows about Egypt,

242
00:10:42.127 --> 00:10:45.997
that Seti the First would have immortalized

243
00:10:45.997 --> 00:10:50.434
and made sacred artifacts from a time that came before.

244
00:10:50.434 --> 00:10:53.671
I'm not obviously claiming that Seti the First

245
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.474
in the old kingdom had tanks and helicopters

246
00:10:56.474 --> 00:10:58.943
and all that hidden in some tomb.

247
00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:01.480
What I'm claiming is that when he built that temple

248
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.748
which is right up against the Assyrian,

249
00:11:03.748 --> 00:11:07.484
which is this incredibly much more ancient structure,

250
00:11:07.484 --> 00:11:09.520
the purpose is totally unknown,

251
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.457
that appears to come from maybe 13,000 years ago,

252
00:11:13.457 --> 00:11:17.127
that he was trying to record

253
00:11:17.127 --> 00:11:21.099
and immortalize things which were secretly sacred

254
00:11:21.099 --> 00:11:23.868
to the priesthood of his time,

255
00:11:23.868 --> 00:11:27.188
almost like the remembrance of a Renaissance.

256
00:11:28.972 --> 00:11:31.209
Exactly when those things were functioning on Earth,

257
00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:32.743
I have no idea.

258
00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:34.711
We just have like a snapshot.

259
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:37.549
The artisans, I believe, carved those things

260
00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:39.082
for a specific reason.

261
00:11:39.082 --> 00:11:41.586
I do not think they're palimpsests,

262
00:11:41.586 --> 00:11:43.621
which is the way that word is described,

263
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:45.990
meaning an accidental image created

264
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.619
when the plaster falls off.

265
00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:48.625
<v Voiceover>No, because every one of them</v>

266
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.295
is a technological machine that exists today.

267
00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:52.464
<v ->And can be identified.</v>

268
00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:54.231
And then, of course, I said to John,

269
00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:56.835
"Is it not possible that because of this physics-driven

270
00:11:56.835 --> 00:11:59.736
"cycle, the concept of the Yuga cycle,

271
00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:01.272
"there being golden ages,

272
00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:04.341
"and then shorter bronze ages, and silver ages,

273
00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:07.478
"and finally the Kali Yuga which is the lowest age,

274
00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:11.382
"that if we reincarnate, we reincarnate again and again

275
00:12:11.382 --> 00:12:13.051
"in specific ages,

276
00:12:13.051 --> 00:12:16.921
"and the same designers and architects and technicians

277
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:20.291
"who built that stuff, a long, long time ago,

278
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:24.127
"are with us now doing it again and again."

279
00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:26.296
Now again you can't prove this,

280
00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:29.100
but it seems to me that one should be open

281
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.268
when you found a physics and you found evidence

282
00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:33.337
of extraterrestrials on other worlds,

283
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:37.595
you should be open to any idea that can be tested,

284
00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:39.242
and this can be tested.

285
00:12:39.242 --> 00:12:41.079
<v Voiceover>So we're talking about taking the information</v>

286
00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:43.446
that may have originated from here

287
00:12:43.446 --> 00:12:46.150
in ancient and higher civilizations.

288
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.254
We leave into other dimensions after death.

289
00:12:49.254 --> 00:12:52.390
We bring information back into this dimension.

290
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.891
What about this whole trance

291
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:56.027
and then reproduce it again at a later time

292
00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.227
when we start waking up again

293
00:12:57.227 --> 00:12:58.763
according to procession?

294
00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:01.699
What do you call this traversing between dimensions

295
00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:04.235
and back now, from more of a scientific point of view

296
00:13:04.235 --> 00:13:05.586
what is it showing up as?

297
00:13:06.704 --> 00:13:09.173
<v ->Well, if we can establish that there's a psychics</v>

298
00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:10.725
to a hyperdimensional link,

299
00:13:13.107 --> 00:13:14.912
during this weekend, during this conference,

300
00:13:14.912 --> 00:13:16.781
there were several speakers who talked about

301
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:20.651
that mind and consciousness are not merely resident

302
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:21.701
between our ears.

303
00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:26.590
Graham Hancock talked about DNA as an antenna.

304
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.891
I thought of it for quite a while

305
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.894
as a hyperdimensional antenna

306
00:13:29.894 --> 00:13:33.397
to where we are a tuned resident structure,

307
00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:37.769
matter in 3D, designed to be receivers

308
00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:39.936
for consciousness from higher dimensions.

309
00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:43.307
So that this whole experience, television notwithstanding

310
00:13:43.307 --> 00:13:46.677
and the internet, is kinda like a VR reality.

311
00:13:46.677 --> 00:13:48.312
And we really are not here.

312
00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:49.579
We're somewhere up the line,

313
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.948
and we're having this experience

314
00:13:50.948 --> 00:13:52.349
with a two-way communication.

315
00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:53.718
<v Voiceover>This is one projection.</v>

316
00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:55.854
<v ->Yeah, well the reason we're here</v>

317
00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:58.823
is to have the experience and send it back up the line

318
00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:00.925
to say two-way communication.

319
00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:03.894
What the physics underlying the Yuga cycle

320
00:14:03.894 --> 00:14:05.663
may be trying to tell us,

321
00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:09.219
is that that communications channel ebbs and flows.

322
00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:14.338
It gets wider and smaller, wider and smaller.

323
00:14:14.338 --> 00:14:17.741
And when it's small, like in our current era,

324
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:20.449
people mostly perceive just this stuff.

325
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:21.212
(tapping)

326
00:14:21.212 --> 00:14:23.882
They're not aware or don't wanna be aware

327
00:14:23.882 --> 00:14:25.616
that there are higher level of connections

328
00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:27.918
to their quote, higher self,

329
00:14:27.918 --> 00:14:30.955
that that concept itself has a physical meaning

330
00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:34.324
because it's a self in a higher set of dimensions.

331
00:14:34.324 --> 00:14:37.862
When the gate opens, when the physics allows

332
00:14:37.862 --> 00:14:40.898
better communication, bigger bandwidth

333
00:14:40.898 --> 00:14:43.099
in the idiom of the 21st Century,

334
00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:45.502
then you do have your golden age.

335
00:14:45.502 --> 00:14:48.639
When the communications channel is wide open,

336
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:52.609
whatever drives that, whatever turns up the rheostat,

337
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:54.144
then you have your golden age.

338
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.413
You have people living as one.

339
00:14:55.413 --> 00:14:58.648
They don't see themselves as separate, in opposition,

340
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.885
in conflict, in competition,

341
00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:04.554
and then however this physics is modulated

342
00:15:04.554 --> 00:15:07.125
be it the binary orbit, being the changing angles

343
00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:09.793
of the Galactic Center, which is my favorite

344
00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:11.429
because we've seen in the solar system

345
00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:12.963
that angles are everything.

346
00:15:12.963 --> 00:15:14.798
The physics of those angular relationships

347
00:15:14.798 --> 00:15:16.200
and how they change.

348
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.168
When Claude, for instance,

349
00:15:17.168 --> 00:15:18.986
talks about the work of John Nelson,

350
00:15:20.104 --> 00:15:22.139
who discovered back in the 1950s

351
00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:24.041
that the changing angular relationships

352
00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:27.278
of the planets around the sun basically modulate

353
00:15:27.278 --> 00:15:30.048
the sunspots cycle, and modulates the ability

354
00:15:30.048 --> 00:15:31.982
to communicate by means of radio,

355
00:15:31.982 --> 00:15:34.452
kind of a metaphor for what we're talking about,

356
00:15:34.452 --> 00:15:38.155
that was the cornerstone of a hyperdimensional astrology

357
00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:41.091
that we have now put a lot of effort to

358
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:43.327
and had lots of confirming data.

359
00:15:43.327 --> 00:15:47.431
So the idea is metamodel that the Yuga cycle

360
00:15:47.431 --> 00:15:52.431
is a reflection of this increasing and decreasing connection

361
00:15:52.434 --> 00:15:56.807
to source that is based in a real physics.

362
00:15:56.807 --> 00:15:58.243
It's not a paranormal thing.

363
00:15:58.243 --> 00:15:59.843
It's not a supernatural thing.

364
00:15:59.843 --> 00:16:02.913
It's just an unknown thing because we're too damn dumb

365
00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:05.983
to remember this is how it works.

366
00:16:05.983 --> 00:16:09.320
And by the time we fully get it, we won't need it.

367
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.620
<v Voiceover>Well, I was going to say when you're talking</v>

368
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.524
about this cyclical age and the golden age,

369
00:16:13.524 --> 00:16:16.193
it sounds to me as though just the sheer remembrance

370
00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:19.062
of a lot of this and bearing it out scientifically

371
00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:23.200
is creating a golden age for those who are already aware.

372
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.634
<v ->That's the other important thing.</v>

373
00:16:24.634 --> 00:16:26.470
When we look at the Yuga cycle and you look at that

374
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.439
very neat diagram showing the 4800 years

375
00:16:29.439 --> 00:16:31.442
from the Seti Yuga, which is the golden age,

376
00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:35.212
and then 3600 years for the, what is it,

377
00:16:35.212 --> 00:16:37.581
the Dwapara Yuga, I think that's the next one.

378
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:39.316
Then Treta Yuga's the third one.

379
00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:40.968
And then Kali Yuga's the shortest one.

380
00:16:42.352 --> 00:16:45.555
You're looking at a snapshot of

381
00:16:45.555 --> 00:16:50.394
all of society, of everybody, the so-called bell curve.

382
00:16:50.394 --> 00:16:54.465
But in the darkest eras, you have geniuses.

383
00:16:54.465 --> 00:16:56.067
In the darkest eras, you have people

384
00:16:56.067 --> 00:16:57.701
who are super conscious.

385
00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:00.838
In the darkest eras, you have people who somehow

386
00:17:00.838 --> 00:17:03.941
have been able, either through genetics or meditation

387
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:08.028
or the right diet or, God knows what it depends on,

388
00:17:09.013 --> 00:17:11.316
are able to keep their personal gate open.

389
00:17:11.316 --> 00:17:13.750
They maintain their connection to source.

390
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.086
<v Voiceover>They maintain their golden age.</v>

391
00:17:15.086 --> 00:17:19.224
<v ->Like you have difference of receivers</v>

392
00:17:19.224 --> 00:17:20.957
in a radio regime

393
00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.860
where you'll have some radios that pick up signals

394
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.228
really well, you know distant stations,

395
00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:28.132
and others can't pick up the station down the street.

396
00:17:28.132 --> 00:17:32.769
So it isn't a monolithic description of the age.

397
00:17:32.769 --> 00:17:35.105
In each age there are exceptions,

398
00:17:35.105 --> 00:17:38.543
and our goal should be to create a critical mass

399
00:17:38.543 --> 00:17:40.512
of conscious beings

400
00:17:40.512 --> 00:17:45.215
and thereby we can change the age in which we live.

401
00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:46.483
And that's what I'm calling

402
00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.920
the global consciousness project two,

403
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.987
where using facilities like the Coast,

404
00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.423
like the Coast audience,

405
00:17:52.423 --> 00:17:55.426
and Art and George's consciousness experiments.

406
00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:58.495
I intend as we make the run up to 2012

407
00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:01.199
to try to do more and more coherent experiments

408
00:18:01.199 --> 00:18:05.536
where a small percentage of people who are together

409
00:18:05.536 --> 00:18:08.772
can outweigh the vast majority of people

410
00:18:08.772 --> 00:18:10.340
who are unconscious,

411
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.945
but some which are seeking to become more conscious.

412
00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:18.548
And by that process, I think we can actually advance

413
00:18:18.548 --> 00:18:20.084
the age in which we live.

414
00:18:20.084 --> 00:18:23.054
And that's a testable, physical thing,

415
00:18:23.054 --> 00:18:24.588
and there's no down side.

416
00:18:24.588 --> 00:18:26.223
I mean if it works, fantastic.

417
00:18:26.223 --> 00:18:28.293
If it doesn't, we tried.

418
00:18:28.293 --> 00:18:29.759
<v Voiceover>I'm leaving it on that note because</v>

419
00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:30.894
that's absolutely perfect,

420
00:18:30.894 --> 00:18:32.929
and thank you for bringing your super genius

421
00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:35.599
into what some think is still pretty darn spirited

422
00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:37.335
because I have faith that we're all going

423
00:18:37.335 --> 00:18:38.368
to do this together.

424
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.604
<v ->You're very kind.</v>

425
00:18:39.604 --> 00:18:40.588
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

426
00:18:42.607 --> 00:18:44.275
<v ->For more information on the big picture,</v>

427
00:18:44.275 --> 00:18:46.211
meaning the procession of the equinox

428
00:18:46.211 --> 00:18:47.945
and all of its implications,

429
00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:49.580
you may also want to watch our interviews

430
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.016
with Roger Crittenden, John Major Jenkins,

431
00:18:52.016 --> 00:18:53.684
and John Anthony West.

432
00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:55.435
Until next time, thanks for watching.
