00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Ron Davis was born as an
autistic and dyslexic in a time

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.840 align:middle line:84%
when there was little compassion
for those who were different.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.510 align:middle line:84%
This heart rending
story takes us

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.510 align:middle line:84%
into the mind of someone who was
unable to communicate and tell

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.130 align:middle line:90%
the age of 17.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.600 align:middle line:90%
By 19 he was teaching calculus.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:84%
At 36 he was a millionaire,
but still ashamed

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%
that he couldn't read.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
That's when the lights went on
and he discovered that dyslexia

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:84%
is a gift that can be
turned off and on that will.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>So Ron, let's start
at the beginning.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Your story is not
only unique, it's

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
very heart rending as well.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
You had a pretty bumpy
start to this life.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us how
you journey began.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>As an infant, my mother was
told I was a Kanners baby.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Leo Kanner
coined the word "autism"

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But I was actually born the
year before it was published.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So I was never actually
called artistic,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I was only called
a Kanners baby.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what my mother
was told about Kanners babies.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she was
told of the probability

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that I would have
grandma epilepsy.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Or the possibility that I would
never develop enough language

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:90%
skills to even talk to her.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.895 align:middle line:84%
Or that I would never allow
her to hold me, or cuddle me,

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:90%
or treat me like a normal child.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And that I might only have the
intelligence of the chimpanzee.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.165 align:middle line:84%
My mother was very good hearing
only what you wanted to hear.

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And what my mother heard
was, I was going to be slow.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
Second World War,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
when my father came
home from the war,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
he was very surprised
to find that he

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
had a three year old,
mentally deficient child.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.865 align:middle line:84%
That surprise very
quickly turned into anger,

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:55.416 align:middle line:90%
and then hatred.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And when the time came for
me to start into school,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the school put
pressure on my parents

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.350 align:middle line:84%
to have me put into
an institution.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
My mother was in
denial, and my father

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
would have been very
happy to have me go away.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.512 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, my
mom told the school,

00:02:14.512 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
he's going to be slow
but you have to take him.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The school really
didn't know what

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:90%
to do with someone like me.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So I wound up sitting in
the corner of the room

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:90%
with a handkerchief on my head.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm often asked,
why the handkerchief?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And tell you the
truth, I don't know.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I was a person
wearing it, I wasn't

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.985 align:middle line:90%
the person that put it there.

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, you were labeled
with the handkerchief.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.068 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do it to yourself?

00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no, no, no.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my back to the room
and my nose was in the corner.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And if that handkerchief
ever fell off, boy, I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
would get a good hard whack,
they'd put it back on,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and stick my nose
tight into the corner.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>May I ask you a
question at this point,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
because I want to hear where
this story goes from here.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.185 align:middle line:84%
>>But as you were sitting
there with your nose

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:01.935 align:middle line:84%
pointed into the corner
and a handkerchief

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
on you head, what was
going on in your world?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, for most of the time
I was oblivious to everything.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Developmentally, I didn't
begin to actually develop

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
at all until around
the age of nine.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, emotionally
and psychologically,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I did between the
ages of nine and 12,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
what a normal child does between
birth and the age of two.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And I did between
the ages of 12 and 15

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
what a normal child does between
the ages of two and four.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
six years or so I

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
was totally oblivious
to everything

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:90%
that was going on around me.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But as I began to develop out
of the autism, I became aware.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I became aware that
I was different

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and that I was being
treated differently.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And literally, by the
time I was 12 years old,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a sin or a crime
I wouldn't have committed

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:84%
with a great big grin on my face
if it would have gotten me out

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:90%
of the corner of the room.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But what they wanted
me to do I couldn't do.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't learn.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.012 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12 years old I
didn't even know my own name.

00:04:13.012 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew where
to go to go home,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.761 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know the name
of the street or the number.

00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't
have been any value

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to know those things
anyway, because when

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I was 12 I still hadn't
learn how to talk.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what happened.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of
every school year

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
there was pressure
put on my parents

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.124 align:middle line:84%
to have me taken away
or labeled something.

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning
of every year

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure my mother
told them, he's slow,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:90%
but you have to keep him.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So the year I was 12
something happened.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the laws
changed and the school could

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
act without my mother,
or if my mother finally

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
gave in to their pressure.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But the year I was 12, the words
uneducatable mental retardation

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:90%
were put into my school records.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And that labeling, for me,
was both something wonderful

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:90%
and something that was terrible.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It was wonderful because
with that labeling,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I no longer had to sit in
the corner of the room.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I even changed schools.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't put
into a school that

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
was for mentally retarded
children, that labeling was

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
both a blessing
and a curse for me.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a blessing
because I no longer had

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to sit in the
corner of the room.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I also got to change
schools, but I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
wasn't put into a school for
mentally retarded children,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I was just put it into a school
where the other children didn't

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:90%
know about me or who I was.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I like magic,
I start stopped

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
wetting my pants
every day in school.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other children
stopped teasing me.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But I still was referred to
by the teachers as the MR kid,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:90%
or an idiot, or an imbecile.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And that word imbecile is one
that I particularly don't like.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Only name than I ever had a
home from my father was dummy.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that was
the best of all of them,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
because dummy
means the inability

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:90%
to speak and not very bright.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I think I fit
into both of those categories.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But later, that
labeling was a curse.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Later in my life,
if my colleagues

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
would have discovered that
those words were attached to me,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
I would've simply died of shame.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
the embarrassment

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
that a person would experience?

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm faking it, pretending
to be a real human being.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And then other people
find out that actually I

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
was mentally retarded.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it goes a
little deeper than that.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12 my
mom was told that I

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
had the intelligence
of the chimpanzee.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:84%
My mother was told
that I had an IQ of 40,

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.169 align:middle line:84%
and a chimpanzee
has an IQ of 40.

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And that I would
never learn any more

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
than what you'd
teach a chimpanzee.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, my older
brother-- when you

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
have a family that has a
member of the family like me,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
essentially the whole family
becomes dysfunctional.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was especially
bad for my older brother

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
because he was the one that
had to take care of me.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So he harbored a great deal
is animosity towards me,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and I can understand why
he did a lot of the things

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:90%
that he did now.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, back then
I didn't understand.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:90%
But he would tease me.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways
he would tease me

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
is see he would say
that I was supposed

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
to be a monkey in a jungle, but
I wound up being his brother

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
instead.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
really got to me

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
was he would say I was
a mistake God made,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and that my older brother
was being tortured by that.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have sophisticated
enough thought ability to know

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
that I was being teased, or I
wasn;t being told the truth.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So literally, during most
of that period of time

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
after I began having the
ability to understand,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
my conception was that I was a
mistake, I was an abomination,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I was something that
shouldn't exist.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%
But I did exist.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
much later than that,

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
when I was 17 years old,
I actually had an IQ test.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
they stopped calling me

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
idiot, imbecile,
and words like that.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
>>What did you test out to?

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>The first testing we did
I scored 137 points on an IQ

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.844 align:middle line:90%
tests.

00:08:41.844 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh my,
we made a mistake.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:90%
He's got a IQ.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Big mistake.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>And at that
point, the decision

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
was made that I would
get speech therapy

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and I would learn how
to talk in sentences.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And they also wanted educate me,
so they were going to teach me

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
how to read, and
write, and spell,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and all of the normal things

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.298 align:middle line:90%
>>Beginning at age 17.

00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And the speech therapy worked.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely wonderful.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.685 align:middle line:84%
I had a fantastic
speech therapist.

00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Her name was Doctor
Meredith Evans.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I wish she could have
lived to the point where

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
she could see what
I'm doing today.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:90%
She would be impressed, I think.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you're at all
aware of our organization,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
there's a great deal
of her influence

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and the essence of who she is.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Her spirit very
much is a reflection

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:90%
of many of the things we do.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Without her I would
still be hiding

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the closet
behind the clothes.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.378 align:middle line:84%
>>But with her help, you were
able to make magnificent leaps

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:90%
between the ages of 17 and 19.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, actually, the speech
therapy, in the beginning,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
was a very painful thing
for me to experience.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I ran
away from it twice.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And the third time, when I came
back, she told me the truth.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
She told me that she
wasn't able to fix me.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
The only person that
could do that was myself.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, she was willing
to help me get there.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But if I was going
to make it, I was

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
do it by myself.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And that little
piece of information

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:90%
is what made all work actually.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I got involved
in the reading training.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
would think that there's

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
been a great deal of improvement
over the years in the way

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:84%
they were treating
dyslexic individuals,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
but to tell you
the truth, not so.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I had to do is

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to crawl around on the
floor for an hour every day.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I had to balance
on a teeter board

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and on a balance board for
a little while every day.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I was subjected
to a great deal of phonics.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you that I was
pretty good at crawling around.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:90%
That was easy.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I was also very
good at the balance.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But the phonics for me
was absolute torture.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Within the first five minutes
of every one of those sessions

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
it would literally become
emotional and physical pain

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:90%
for me to try to endure it.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And after almost a year of
being subjected to that,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:90%
everybody gave up.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Now I had given up
long before that,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:90%
but then everybody else did.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the medical doctor
that was on the staff

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
there told me that I
was never ever going

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to read and write.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
for it was, when I

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
was being born the
doctor used instruments,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:84%
he pinched my head, and he
ruined that part of my brain

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.772 align:middle line:84%
that I would need to use
to learn how to read.

00:11:48.772 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>They didn't know much
about dyslexia at this time?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, they still don't.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.171 align:middle line:84%
When I told my mom
what the doctor said,

00:11:57.171 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
my mom said, no,
that didn't happen.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
She said that my
birth happened so fast

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't time
for instruments.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But also my mom didn't
always tell me the truth.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But it did make my
life a little easier.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It was easier at
that point for me

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
to believe that it
was a mistake that

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
was made by a doctor, a
man, and not a mistake

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:90%
that God had made.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And that I was or I had
justification for existing.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.572 align:middle line:84%
Now in spite of all this,
I became an engineer.

00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:33.155 align:middle line:84%
Even though I couldn't
read and write.

00:12:33.155 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Were you self taught?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.035 align:middle line:84%
>>Everything for me
has been self taught.

00:12:36.035 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s we were in a race
to get to the moon with Russia.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And our government
realized that there

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
was a lack of good engineers
in the United States.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
you could actually

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
be certified as an
engineer without having

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.947 align:middle line:90%
graduated from a University.

00:12:56.947 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you had to
be a engineer already,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:84%
but that's the kind
of engineer I am.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.404 align:middle line:84%
I'm a certified
mechanical engineer.

00:13:05.404 --> 00:13:07.153 align:middle line:84%
>>How did you end up
choosing engineering?

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:90%
How did this develop?

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Well I had been an engineer.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I think I was born that way.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a great love
of mathematics.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, way
before it ever speak.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was doing math before
I had the ability to remember.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
When I was eight years old
I was doing trigonometry.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Now savantism usually
doesn't bridge over

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:90%
into formula type mathematics.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's adding, subtracting,
multiplying, and dividing.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Yet, for some reason,
I made the bridge.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've only had
two formal classes

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics in my life.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.366 align:middle line:84%
The first one was when I was
in ninth grade in school.

00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I was allowed to take an
algebra class that I failed.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I failed because I
never wrote down anything

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:90%
but answers.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I took trigonometry
at a university.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And at that time I was
also taking English.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So I never, ever went to math
class, I just went on the first

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:90%
and then days of tests.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think in that
class I got a B.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But I could do
trigonometry for 10 years

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:90%
before I ever took the class.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me it was
a part of who I was.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It was more a part of me than my
hands and feet were to do math.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've always had a great
love for mathematics.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Do autism and savant
usually got hand in hand?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, now that there's a
great deal more understood

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:90%
about what autism is.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
The words savant,
of idiot savant,

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
it was coined for
people like me.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are other areas
that it can bridge over into;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:90%
music, art, many other things.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.535 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you have other
areas besides mathematics

00:15:06.535 --> 00:15:08.105 align:middle line:90%
that it did bridge over into?

00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I could play
any musical instrument

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:90%
that I could get my hands on.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
My mother's mother was
a classical pianist.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
That, in her own
right, was considered

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
a bit of a child protege.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:84%
When she was 16, before they
came to the United States,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
she toured Europe performing
with Albert Schweitzer.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The Scheitzer family
made pianos and organs

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and they would do tours.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, my grandmother
had a grand piano

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.122 align:middle line:84%
that only she was
allowed to touch.

00:15:44.122 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And then she had an
upright that everybody else

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:90%
but me could touch.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't allowed
to get close to it.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.530 align:middle line:84%
If I got too close, I
would get shooed away.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:90%
But math and, to a agree, art--

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you finally get
to play that piano?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
out of the autism,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I left my music
appreciation behind.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But I did bring my
art appreciation,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and what was most
important, the math.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.975 align:middle line:84%
>>So going back to the
story then in the 1960s

00:16:20.975 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
we had a race to the moon
with the Russians and Nigeria.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>I was certified
as an engineer,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
but before that I
was a technician.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I discovered going too
technical institutes.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was always sent
by employers to these,

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and I did graduate from five
different technical institutes.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.553 align:middle line:84%
And then was later
certified as an engineer.

00:16:43.553 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But soon after being
certified as an engineer,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I turned my back on all of it.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Dallas,
Texas at the time.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.104 align:middle line:84%
And I came to San
Fransisco to be a hippy.

00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:05.645 align:middle line:84%
>>We were talking off-camera a
little bit ago about something

00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
that happened when you
were 19 years old, where

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
some entities were tapping
into your engineering ability.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.825 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, at that point in time,
I was the only a technician.

00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They were taking
advantage of my ability

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:90%
to think mathematically.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And the logic that comes
with mathematical thinking.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And how were they
trying to utilize it?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.082 align:middle line:84%
>>I could figure out
how to make things work.

00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:42.145 align:middle line:84%
>>Things the government needed
to provide some answers to?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>It wasn't the
government, per se,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
it was through the industry
that was providing weaponry,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and missiles, and things
for the American government.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.106 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that--

00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>The defense industry.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>I worked on the
Polaris missile system,

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I work on the Minutemen
missile system.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.219 align:middle line:84%
And then later, the air to
air missiles and surface

00:18:08.219 --> 00:18:08.885 align:middle line:90%
to air missiles.

00:18:08.885 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that was part
of the whole impetus

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to pursue being a hippy.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, let's go into that.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>I realized that
everything I was doing

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.072 align:middle line:84%
was intended to hurt
or to kill people.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to do that anymore.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just essentially
one day decided,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and I just turned around and
walked away from everything.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>So what happened
after you ended up

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of all
the flower power?

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I actually failed
at being a hippy.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And of all the things
that I have failed at,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.007 align:middle line:90%
that was probably the worst.

00:18:49.007 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you really
think about it--

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>How can you fail
at being a hippy?

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We weren't laid back enough,
or [INAUDIBLE], or what?

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>The reason I failed
was because of the drugs.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that I had a
moral or an ethical issue

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
against the drugs,
it's that I simply

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:90%
didn't like what they did to me.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
it at the time,

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:90%
but I fully understand it now.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The drugs caused me to be
disoriented, and actually

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
disorientation-- the
state of disorientation,

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:84%
has been at the root of all my
problems for all of my life.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And to deliberately
do that to myself,

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:90%
I found it to be very offensive.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>After you just worked
your way out of it.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it actually
is still a factor.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But I have turned
it to my advantage

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:90%
and not my disadvantage.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself faking
it, being a hippy.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Faking it being
stoned when you weren't?

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So I just decided,
well, I might as well

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
fake being an ordinary
person, the same as this.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself in
a bit of a quandary.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't continue in that
lifestyle, being a hippy.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't go back to the
lifestyle I had come from,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
which is designing and building
weapons for killing people.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So I had to find a job.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So I got a job as a driving
instructor in San Fransisco.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And that actually was not my
first experience teaching.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
When I was 19, one of
the jobs that I had to do

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
was I had to teach calculus
to the technicians that

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:84%
were working with me at
[INAUDIBLE] Corporation.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I
love mathematics,

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
teaching mathematics
that way, I hated it,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:84%
because I was going to
a classroom every day

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
with the chalkboard
and all of that.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And I myself have never learned
anything in a classroom.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So even though I
love mathematics,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I hated teaching it that way.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But when I was working
as a driving instructor,

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in a classroom, I
was in a car with someone.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was working one with
one with the individual.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And if the person made a mistake
we would catch it immediately.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We would figure out a
solution for the error,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.400 align:middle line:84%
implement the solution, and
the error would disappear.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was a feeling
of instant gratification.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And I really like that feeling
so I really liked that job.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And to tell you the truth, I'd
probably still be doing it,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
but I caught the company
that I was working

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
for-- I cause them
cheating my students.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And I confronted them with that
and, of course, they denied it,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
so the only thing I
could do was quit.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>So what happened
between that point

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
were you were having some real
gratification in the workforce

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
to beginning your
understanding with working

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
with a dyslexic mind?

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>There were a lot of different
condentations between then

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and now.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
When I stopped being a hippy,
I started to Volkswagen repair

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.435 align:middle line:90%
shop in San Francisco.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not a bad thing
for an ex-engineer to do.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:09.436 align:middle line:84%
Not long after that, I created
a metals brokerage company.

00:22:09.436 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And not long after that,
I started my career

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:90%
in real estate.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And not long after
that, I realized

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:84%
the great American dream for
the second time in my life,

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and that was to
be a millionaire.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the late 1960s,
the real estate market

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
started to slow down and
my wife and I retired.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, I misstated.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1970s,
the real estate market

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
started to slow down, my
wife and I retired out

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:90%
of real estate.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And we had more
than enough money

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of our lives, no
matter what we wanted to do.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was 36 years old
and I was retired.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
things I did is I

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
hid my shame behind
being successful.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I was hiding
my low self esteem behind work.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.952 align:middle line:84%
And when you're hiding
the fact that you're

00:23:24.952 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
a mistake that God made, or
a mistake that some man made,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and that you're not a real human
being, what better way to hid

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:90%
it then behind being successful.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So I was being successful.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, I didn't

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:90%
work like a normal human being.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I worked between 12
and 20 hours every day,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and I did work every day.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So I never went to
the movies, I worked.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I never went to church,
never went to weddings

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:84%
or funerals because
I was working.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I never want to parties, I
never went to the theater

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
because I worked.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
successful at work

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
because no one ever discovered
that I couldn't read.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>During all of that--

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>During all of that.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely amazing.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>But then we
looked at retiring,

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and retirement means
that you don't work.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of retiring
wasn't a bad idea.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But what was a bad
idea was not working,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:84%
because I lost my
ability to hide.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, it isn't just that I
was hiding my inadequacy

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:84%
from other people, I was
also hiding it from myself.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening
is, with every day,

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.653 align:middle line:84%
I was getting more
and more depressed.

00:24:41.653 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't realize
that's what it was at the time.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the kind of person
that will go to a doctor.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of them, I
just don't like them.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>They didn't serve you well
in childhood, it sounds like.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I'm not going to
get very deep into that,

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
because I could
get into trouble.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.224 align:middle line:84%
But I came to a point
where I realized

00:25:05.224 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
have to do something

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:84%
about the way I was feeling
or I was going to die.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And for me, all of my life art
has been the real narcotic.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
If I get involved
with something--

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
even if it's simply drawing
something, or sketching

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
something, or chipping
a piece of stone,

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
or carving a piece of wood, or
making something out of clay,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:84%
or painting-- literally,
the rest of world

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
goes away until I finished
doing what I was doing.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that if I couldn't
hide my problem behind work,

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I could be oblivious
to it with art.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't feel that
I had enough talent

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:84%
to earn a living as an artist,
but I was in a position

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to earn a living,
so I started to play with it.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.922 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, I was
working as a portrait sculptor

00:25:53.922 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and I discovered that I
could make a wonderful living

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:90%
as an artist.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
To the point that, if I ever
have the misfortune again

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
of retiring, I'm going to go
back and be an artist again.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it was like
dying and doing to heaven.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was when I was
working as an artist I began

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to notice things that
didn't make sense

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:90%
to the engineering in me.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed was that when
I was at my artistic best,

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I was at my dyslexic worst.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had believed
that my problem

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:90%
was a structural problem.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I believed the reason I couldn't
learn how to read and write

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
was because I had
brain damage, which

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:84%
means it is a
structural problem.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
about a structural problem

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the characteristics
of the problem

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:90%
has to remain the same.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was noticing that it
wasn't remaining the same.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And my thinking
was, I can't have

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
brain damage this afternoon
and tomorrow morning it's

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:84%
going to go away
for a little while,

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow afternoon it's
going to come back again.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:90%
That cannot work.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Then the thinking was,
well, if the problem is not

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.621 align:middle line:84%
a structural problem,
then what can it be?

00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, the only
other thing that it can be

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a
functional problem.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
If it is a functional
problem that means

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I am either doing
something that causes it,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
or I'm failing to do something
and that's what causes it.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And with that thinking,
I became a researcher

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:90%
in the field of dyslexia.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And within 36 hours
after starting looking,

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I discovered something
that I could do inside

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:84%
of my head that made all of
the symptoms simply go away.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And that day, I
went to a library

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and I read a book from
cover to cover in one day.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you share in this
moment, or do we need to--

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.921 align:middle line:90%
>>What book it was?

00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.211 align:middle line:84%
What it was that you
could go in your hear.

00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I discovered what we
now call orientation.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I discovered was
a very rudimentary form.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It was just the beginning of it.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.622 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in
an oriented state,

00:27:52.622 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:84%
the words on the
bottom of the page

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
were just as big as the
words on the top of the page.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
There were spaces
between the letters,

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
there was actually
punctuation marks.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the letters didn't
run together with the words,

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
there were spaces
between the words,

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:90%
you could clearly see them.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had been struggling
to learn how to read,

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
or struggling with
reading, my whole life.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, prior to that day it isn't
that I couldn't read at all--

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I would say that what
the average person could

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
reading maybe five minutes,
I could get through it

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.230 align:middle line:84%
in maybe an hour, maybe
a little more than that.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But I would never be really
certain if I got it all

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:90%
or if I got it correctly.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But what I discovered was
this very rudimentary form

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:90%
of orientation.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And I read a whole
book in one day.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, I never dreamed of the
ability to read a whole book.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
For me, that dream would
have been a nightmare.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.554 align:middle line:84%
I never prayed for the
ability to read a whole book.

00:28:49.554 --> 00:28:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think that's
the kind of prayer

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.030 align:middle line:90%
that God would answer.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So one day in my life,
I had an experience

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that was beyond my
ability to dream

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and beyond my ability to pray.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that experience,

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:90%
two things occurred.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing that occurred

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:84%
was that it was the
first day of my life

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.650 align:middle line:84%
that I considered myself
as a real human being.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I considered myself as not being
a mistake that anyone had made,

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and that I had just as much
right as any other human

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.705 align:middle line:90%
to be alive.

00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Now you're getting at the real
heart of the issue of dyslexia

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is this sense of being less
than that each of these people

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:90%
carry with them.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.573 align:middle line:90%
>>Indeed.

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.835 align:middle line:84%
>>And so what did this
do to inspire you then

00:29:39.835 --> 00:29:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to launch into this
as a life path?

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.957 align:middle line:90%
>>Several things.

00:29:44.957 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
happened that day

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is, I made a mistake in thinking
that I cured myself of dyslexia

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Now prior to then, I
had never told anyone

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:90%
that I had dyslexia.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
I was ashamed of.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want anyone to know.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I went to great
lengths to hide it from people.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But after I thought
I was cured, I

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't waste any time
telling people I was cured.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.952 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly,
a lot of people

00:30:08.952 --> 00:30:10.410 align:middle line:84%
came out of the
woodwork, it seemed

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:84%
like, that asked me
if I would help them.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that
point in time, I

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anyone
else that had dyslexia.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I thought I was a
lot more rare than I really was.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know any other
people that were dyslexic.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out,
there were a lot of us

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that were hiding
it from each other.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing
with them the same kind

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:90%
of torture I put myself through.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And literally, we started
to see tremendous change.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But I also, along
the way, realized

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't actually
cured myself of dyslexia.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I realized at the very
most all I had found

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
was a piece to a
puzzle, and there

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
were other puzzle pieces
that had to be found.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Was the beginning
point you're were

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:84%
talking about, about
finding this orientation?

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what I was
doing, I didn't even

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
understand at the time
that's what it was.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So this actually occurred--
the break through actually

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.580 align:middle line:90%
occurred in December of 1980.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:84%
By April of 1981, I
realized I wasn't cured.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after that,
I and two other people

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:84%
created the Reading
Research Council.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And we had two
basic goals in mind.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:90%
And I had a hidden agenda.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
The first goal was to
see if we could find out

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.522 align:middle line:90%
what dyslexia really was.

00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:84%
To see if we could find the
rest of the puzzle pieces

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:90%
that it was composed of.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
The second goal was, if
we find the puzzle pieces,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could figure out
how to put that puzzle together

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:84%
so we could actually
cure dyslexia.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.485 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at that time,
we didn't understand it

00:31:55.485 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
to the point to realize that
we wouldn't want to cure it.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And my hidden agenda
was, I'm paying for this

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:84%
so I get to be the
first person in line.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So by December of
1981, we had enough

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of a rudimentary understanding
of the puzzle pieces

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that we could start
to put them together.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And by April of 1982, we
knew what would actually

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:84%
have to be done in
order to correct it.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't done it
yet, but we knew

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:84%
what we would have to do in
order to make that happen.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And in April of 1982,
we started working

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.220 align:middle line:90%
with individuals in the public.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And the first year that
we were in operation,

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:90%
we had a 93% success rate.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Did you have them crawling?

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>No, absolutely not.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:84%
That just shows the
ignorance the people.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
When we first started
looking at dyslexia,

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
there were two prevailing
beliefs-- actually,

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.925 align:middle line:84%
there were three-- prevailing
beliefs about what dyslexia was

00:33:05.925 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and what caused it.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:84%
The first one goes
clear back to 1896,

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and it was the original
definition of dyslexia.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.545 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
controversy over exactly who

00:33:15.545 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:90%
it is that coined the word.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the British camp.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I think the word was coined by
a physician in the Glasgow Eye

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Infirmary in Scotland.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:90%
His name was James Hinshelwood.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And he defined dyslexia
as a form aphasia marked

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
by the inability to
develop cyphering skills,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
probable location of
the aphasiac lesion

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:90%
left angular gyrus.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:90%
He was a medical doctor.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:84%
He's talking so that
we can't understand.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:84%
The word "aphasia" means the
loss or the lack of the ability

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to use or understand language,
caused brain damage or nerve

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
damage from either
illness or injury.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:90%
So it is a form of brain damage.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes on to say the
probable location of the brain

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:84%
damage is the left angular
gyrus of the brain.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
That, oddly enough, is
still the medical definition

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:90%
of the word dyslexia.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1920s, 30s, there
was an American physician,

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
his name was Doctor
Samuel Torrey Orton,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:90%
who tried to redefine dyslexia.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And his first attempt
at redefining it

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
was, he said that dyslexia is a
product of cross lateralization

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
the left side of the brain

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:84%
does what the right side
should do, and vice versa.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:84%
And even though he
authored that theory,

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:43.470 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't very long
after it was published

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.400 align:middle line:90%
that he changed his mind.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But even though he
changed his mind,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of people
that still followed it.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And he watered it
down some and said

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.319 align:middle line:84%
that it was mixed
hemispheric dominance.

00:34:57.319 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that sometimes
the left side of the brain

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.740 align:middle line:84%
is doing what the right side
should do, and vice versa.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.115 align:middle line:84%
And that is the primary
psychological belief

00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:90%
of what dyslexia is.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So both of these go back to
either our brains are miswired,

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:84%
or there's actual
brain damage that

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is there that is preventing
something from occurring.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
out is that, even

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.280 align:middle line:84%
though both of these theories
sound good, sound reasonable,

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
they're incorrect.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Dyslexia is actually a
product of three things.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It is a product of thought,
it as a product of talent,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and it is product
of a low tolerance

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:43.550 align:middle line:84%
or a low threshold
for confusion.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we started
working with dyslexia,

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:84%
we thought we were
looking for a cure.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you consider
that a part of dyslexia

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.760 align:middle line:84%
comes from talent, the only
cure for a talent that I know of

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:90%
is death.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think we really
want to have a cure for it.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So we will settle
for the next best

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
thing, which is a
correction for it.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And the basic philosophy
behind everything that I do

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is that, if you eliminate the
reason why a problem exists,

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:28.000 align:middle line:84%
the problem will stop
existing or causing someone

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:90%
to be oriented.

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:84%
All of the symptoms
of dyslexia are

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:84%
symptoms of the
disorientated state.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.750 align:middle line:84%
If the person to simply
turn off being disoriented,

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:90%
they can turn off the symptoms.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was doing
that I mistook for a cure.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
When I realized that I wasn't
cured, that all I had done

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was found a piece
to a puzzle, we

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:84%
had to then dig a little
bit deeper into the puzzle

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and find out what it
is that was actually

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.490 align:middle line:84%
causing it to be there
in the first place.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered that it was
the feeling of confusion that

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
was stimulating
the disorientation.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So we isolated where the
sources of that confusion were.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And by mastering the
sources of the confusion,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:84%
we're eliminating the reason
why the problem exists

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.860 align:middle line:90%
as a problem.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not
curing the dyslexia.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not causing people who are
primarily thinking with images

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.960 align:middle line:84%
to suddenly think
with sounds of words.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They may or may not
ever develop that skill

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.830 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't matter.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I think most people to
think primarily with images

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:84%
or feel that they're
very much slowed down

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
by this cumbersome
slow word thinking

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:84%
process-- the other
kind of thinking

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.605 align:middle line:84%
is so much faster and
so much more accurate.

00:37:48.605 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>From that point,
you ended up even

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
expressing dyslexia
as a gift and writing

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
a book called "The
Gift of Dyslexia".

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.652 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you talk
about this as a gift?

00:38:03.652 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to go
back to this point you're

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:84%
talking about, about the
brain having to slow down

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:84%
to assimilate information
in black and white digits.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we can read a
lot faster than-- it

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to go slow.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.520 align:middle line:84%
As long as you
understand the mechanics

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of what it is it that
you're wanting to do.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The verbal communication
cannot be speeded up.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.160 align:middle line:84%
An awful lot of
dyslexic children

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.040 align:middle line:84%
will have difficulty
with learning how to talk

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and their speech
patterns sometimes

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.270 align:middle line:90%
might even be a bit garbled.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Those things are corrected
along with correcting

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the other problems that
are related to dyslexia.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that
dyslexia is a reading problem.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Dyslexia affects, or can affect,
reading, writing, speaking,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:84%
spelling, mathematics,
physical coordination, and also

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:59.876 align:middle line:90%
our perception of time.

00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.334 align:middle line:84%
>>Dyslexia then
doesn't necessarily

00:39:01.334 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
mean that a person simply
has a reading disability?

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Well the word
dyslexia, we use it

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:90%
because it is the parent term.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The different aspects
of dyslexia-- and there

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
are more than 80 different
words that they use now

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:84%
for different
aspects of dyslexia.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And the current,
most popular one,

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:24.970 align:middle line:90%
is attention deficit disorder.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.860 align:middle line:84%
We consider it just another
one of the aspects of dyslexia.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of it is correctable,
we can correct every form of it.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's go to the next higher
octave, how is this a gift?

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>In evaluating
how a person would

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.530 align:middle line:84%
go about developing
dyslexia, there

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.770 align:middle line:84%
are certain characteristics
that we have.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is, we are
born with the genetic code that

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:84%
allows us to do things that
a normal person would not

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:90%
be able to do.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And what it allows
us to do is, it

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
allows us to cause a
disorientation to occur.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, all human beings disorient.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:90%
It is a normal, natural thing.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this
disorientation is one

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of the things you have to do in
order to go to sleep at night.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:84%
If you ever have a sudden
feeling like you're falling,

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
or your body suddenly jerks
just before you go to sleep,

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that's the moment when
the disorientation occurs.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever
had the experience

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of riding in a vehicle or
sitting in a vehicle that's

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:30.780 align:middle line:84%
stationary, something
outside the vehicle

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.510 align:middle line:84%
moves and you have the
sensation that you're moving,

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
that fall sensation, or
that false perception,

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.970 align:middle line:90%
is coming from disorientation.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It happens to everyone.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But some of us are born
with the genetic code that

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
allows us to do it without
an outside stimuli.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we discover this
ability very early in life,

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:84%
probably before
we're six months old.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:84%
We discover that by using
that part of our anatomy,

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:84%
we can actually perceive things
that other people wouldn't

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.220 align:middle line:90%
be able to perceive.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We can hear maybe
10 times better

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:90%
than a normal human being.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to detect smells
and odors can be much enhanced.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Literally, is like being able
to see around corners or see

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:90%
through walls.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So probably the very
first time any of us

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:84%
ever use our ability
to disorient,

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.570 align:middle line:84%
we use it to recognize our
mother, the person that

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.070 align:middle line:90%
feeds us.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And we then expand
the use of that

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to other things in
the environment.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, we
will become very environmentally

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:90%
aware.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Much more so than a
normal human being.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can explore the
environment mentally much more

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.880 align:middle line:84%
thoroughly than a normal human
being would be able to do.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.960 align:middle line:84%
But in doing this, we also
create a crossroads for us.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Our early childhood
development isn't

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.000 align:middle line:84%
going to go straight down the
way it does for other children.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.940 align:middle line:84%
You look at the early
childhood development books

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that most expectant
mothers will look at,

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and they read about what they
can expect from their child.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do that.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's take just one of these.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:84%
An individual who is exploring
the environment mentally

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:84%
will either be very
motivated to become mobile.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're very
motivated now to get out

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.059 align:middle line:84%
there and not just
explore it mentally,

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:84%
but to get their hands on
it, to get it in their mouth,

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.400 align:middle line:90%
to explore it physically.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So a person like
this is going to be

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:84%
very motivated to
control movement.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.734 align:middle line:84%
So they will start crawling very
early, and by the time they're

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:84%
supposed to start crawling,
they're already up

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and running around.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.567 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, the
person has already explored it.

00:42:57.567 --> 00:42:59.150 align:middle line:84%
They already know
where it is and what

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
it is, they don't
need to be mobile.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So they aren't motivated
to become mobile.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So the time to start crawling
comes and goes, they don't.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It's time for them
to start walking,

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're still not
even crawling very well.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks that there's
something wrong with the child.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's wrong
is they're not motivated.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens
with talking and language.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:84%
On one route, you can be very
motivated to communicate.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:84%
On the other route, you have
no need to communicate at all.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you go down the route
where it happens quickly,

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:84%
everybody thinks
that you're advanced.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Parents are very
happy with that.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you go down the
road where it's delayed,

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.610 align:middle line:84%
it's quite the
opposite reaction.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It is seen as something
wrong with the individual

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
as a developmental
delay, there's

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.730 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with the
child, do therapy to fix it.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's really
missing is the motivation.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have this going
on in the background,

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and it would look like this
is something that is negative.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we are
also primarily thinking only

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.100 align:middle line:90%
with images.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Now all infants, all
human beings, this

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is our native way of
thinking, with images.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't even do
verbal thinking

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.070 align:middle line:90%
until you've learned language.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have to know the language
before you can do verbal.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So it is the nonverbal thinking
that is native to all people.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>This is one thing I've
always been curious about.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.040 align:middle line:84%
If as a species the
masses have not really

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:38.330 align:middle line:84%
read until the last
150 years, what

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.200 align:middle line:84%
a huge paradigm shift, what
a huge shift for the brain

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.000 align:middle line:84%
to have to go through from
this other conceptual thinking

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:84%
through images and such, and
the verbal word verses written.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:90%
What has this done to us?

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Well it has brought
us to another crossroads

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:90%
in being humans.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're either going
to kill ourselves

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.910 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to figure out
a way to survive through it.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you go through
Europe and you

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.850 align:middle line:84%
visit the cathedrals
of Europe, you walk in.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, I was very
surprised because they all

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:84%
look like comic books on the
inside with all that art work.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Until you realize that that
was the only way that they had

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
of communicating with
the masses of people,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.710 align:middle line:84%
because the masses of people
couldn't read written language.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So they tried to show it to
them in the form of paintings

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and murals inside the churches
and the religious centers.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>And now we're at a
period again to such a

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.530 align:middle line:84%
really short time after we
began reading as a species,

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.570 align:middle line:84%
to where we're going
to back into a world

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:84%
of graphic imagery, of voice
recognition, et cetera.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.500 align:middle line:84%
How soon before we've
actually blown past the need

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to have to simulate
information in this way?

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.687 align:middle line:84%
>>Well I think that's
for the next generation.

00:45:57.687 --> 00:45:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Seems like a hard
thing to adapt to.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>I think as for the next
evolutionary stage of mankind--

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to have
to deal with that

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:11.204 align:middle line:84%
and they will probably see
not as a problem at all,

00:46:11.204 --> 00:46:13.120 align:middle line:84%
as just something that
they'll just blow past.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Because they will look back at
us as being rather redundant.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>And doesn't that
seem natural in that

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.830 align:middle line:84%
what we appear to be
evolving into via graphics

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.704 align:middle line:84%
through the internet,
computers, et cetera?

00:46:26.704 --> 00:46:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It's really our native way
of processing information

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.770 align:middle line:84%
anyway, through
images and sound.

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Now see, the whole
thing about human beings

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.810 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
a greater ability

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:84%
to adapt than the other
creatures on the planet Earth.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can make these
adaptions, we can grow.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of doing that,

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:84%
we are pushing the
limits and the need

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.660 align:middle line:90%
for us to change genetically.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.867 align:middle line:84%
Mankind goes-- I mean,
we'll make a big change

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll stay that
way for a period of time,

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll make
another big change.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.090 align:middle line:90%
And we have been making changes.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to look at an
indication or an indicator

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.860 align:middle line:84%
of when there is a major
revolutionary change, what

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.769 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at
is the intelligence

00:47:16.769 --> 00:47:17.560 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.430 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I see four earlier times
within the last 400 years

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.140 align:middle line:84%
where attempts to be
made for human beings

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to get more intelligent.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And each time you will
see a pocket or pockets

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.902 align:middle line:90%
of greater intelligence.

00:47:38.902 --> 00:47:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Like right at the
end of the Dark Ages

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:49.380 align:middle line:84%
we see people like Leonardo
da Vinci and that whole group.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't catch
on, it didn't stick.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Then we come a
little further along

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and we see the
Keplers, that era.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And again, it didn't stick.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we come
almost to modern times

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and we see people like Albert
Einstein, and Thomas Edison,

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and Henry Ford, and that group.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:90%
And again, it didn't stick.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But about 70 years ago,
there was the beginning

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.710 align:middle line:90%
of what we're into right now.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Can you explain that?

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>I have at home a document
that I got from the government,

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.410 align:middle line:84%
from the Government
Accounting Office.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was published in
January of this year that

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.340 align:middle line:84%
says that the number of
children entering the education

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:53.270 align:middle line:84%
system with autism has increased
500% in the last 10 years.

00:48:53.270 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, part of that 500% is a
change in awareness of autism.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And two, a change in the
diagnostic criteria for autism.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But that would only account
for maybe 20% to 50%,

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.945 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
a 500% increase.

00:49:10.945 --> 00:49:12.945 align:middle line:84%
>>So we're talking about
an evolutionary change?

00:49:12.945 --> 00:49:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>We are talking about
an evolutionary change.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And this evolutionary change
didn't start 10 years ago,

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:22.210 align:middle line:84%
it started 70 years ago, and
it just barely now at the point

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:24.590 align:middle line:84%
where it is
attracting attention.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And we've got maybe
four more generations

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.300 align:middle line:84%
before the incidences
of autism is 100%.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Does this spill
over into the area

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that's lesser known,
which has to do

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:38.430 align:middle line:84%
these pockets of
extremely gifted children

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.431 align:middle line:90%
around the planet?

00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>That's exactly what
we're talking about.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.751 align:middle line:84%
>>Being able to know
everything at once.

00:49:44.751 --> 00:49:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>That is exactly what it
is that we're talking about.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It is happening in all
cultures, every place in a world

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.760 align:middle line:84%
where there are human
beings, all of the races.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.170 align:middle line:84%
We're all going through
this evolutionary change

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:00.250 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:90%
This one isn't going to die.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:84%
This one is not going to die
out, it's not going to stop.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.530 align:middle line:84%
When you get a 500% increase
in a 10 year period of time,

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:84%
realize that goes from 22,020
to 11 million in 10 years.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>And there are no
systems to accommodate

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:19.553 align:middle line:90%
this kind of intelligence?

00:50:19.553 --> 00:50:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>There is no understanding.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the higher functioning
form of autism we

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.090 align:middle line:84%
know how to correct
that, we know

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.000 align:middle line:84%
what it is that has
to be done to fix it.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't advertise it,
we don't talk about it.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the more severe
forms, the Kanners syndrome,

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:39.090 align:middle line:84%
is something that we haven't
been able to address.

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The research project that I am
been embarking on right now--

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.850 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago I
left this research,

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm now getting back into it.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And it is very important.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It is crucial to
my way of thinking.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:58.470 align:middle line:84%
When the incidence
of autism is 100%,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.580 align:middle line:84%
who is going to care for
the autistic children?

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.285 align:middle line:84%
Who is going to
control government?

00:51:07.285 --> 00:51:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Autistic individuals.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Especially when we really
are not clear on what it is.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Other people are not
clear on what it is.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.440 align:middle line:84%
For me, it is very
clear of what it is.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.356 align:middle line:90%
>>For you, it's clear.

00:51:21.356 --> 00:51:24.690 align:middle line:84%
You are one of the-- yes, the
brilliants locked up in this--

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>The new ones.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:30.170 align:middle line:84%
These people are called
a lot of different names

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.630 align:middle line:84%
by a lot of different people
that have looked into it.

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Star children and
indigo children.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.765 align:middle line:90%
I know them simply as new ones.

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>The new ones.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>The new ones.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>And in the past, when we have
corrected a high functioning

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:53.730 align:middle line:84%
autistic individual,
the IQ range

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:59.490 align:middle line:84%
settles out between
about 130 and 180.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I've only worked successfully
with two Kanners syndrome

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:03.450 align:middle line:90%
individuals.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Their IQs settle out above 180.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Amazing.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Now we're not talking about
a 15% increase in intelligence,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
probably about 100% increase

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:18.320 align:middle line:90%
in intellect intelligence.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:24.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, right now there's bit
of a research thing going on

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in New Zealand where a person
is following my instructions

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and working with an autistic
boy that at this stage as an IQ

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that is probably beyond
the ability to be measured.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
a 200 or a 250 IQ,

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.644 align:middle line:84%
it's mind boggling the
intellect that we're

00:52:49.644 --> 00:52:50.935 align:middle line:90%
going to be seeing in 10 years.

00:52:50.935 --> 00:52:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's no coincidence
that these people

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.540 align:middle line:84%
are being born into
this period of history?

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>What is this showing you?

00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.785 align:middle line:90%
What is this saying to you?

00:52:59.785 --> 00:53:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>It's our evolutionary change.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.600 align:middle line:84%
We will either adapt to
the evolutionary change

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.720 align:middle line:90%
or we will succumb to it.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I feel a part of
my future, in fact, I

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:84%
know that the purpose that I
am alive, the reason that I

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:15.500 align:middle line:84%
am here is to be
involved in making

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.813 align:middle line:84%
it possible for this
occurrence to happen.

00:53:19.813 --> 00:53:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, as human
beings, as we evolve,

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.730 align:middle line:84%
you can't make a
gain in one area

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.640 align:middle line:84%
without making a sacrifice
in some other area.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're already at the
very top of this chain.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we have always
sacrificed in order

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to be here-- and
it's not just us,

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.540 align:middle line:84%
it's the other
animal forms as well.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.780 align:middle line:84%
When we make it a
gain, what we sacrifice

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:90%
is usually our basic instincts.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're told,
medically, that we

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:84%
don't have very
many to being with.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.630 align:middle line:84%
That a human baby is born with
the fewest natural instincts

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:middle line:90%
of any animal that is born.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the goal for this
next evolutionary change

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is taking, again, away
from a natural instinct.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And part of the natural
instinct that is taken away

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.515 align:middle line:84%
is what is causing the
sudden rise in dyslexia.

00:54:18.515 --> 00:54:21.180 align:middle line:90%


00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, in autism.

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Because this interview is too
long to put into one download,

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.960 align:middle line:84%
we have a second part
that continues his journey

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.230 align:middle line:84%
through the process of
discovering the sudden 500

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.470 align:middle line:84%
fold increase in autism
over the last decade.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Our evolution as a species
and how our education system

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.770 align:middle line:90%
is going to need to respond.

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Just click on Ron
Davis Part Two.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:56.000 align:middle line:90%
