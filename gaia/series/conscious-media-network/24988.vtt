00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:03.820
<v ->We continue our conversation with Dr. Steven Hairfield,</v>

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.328
author of A Metaphysical Interpretation of the Bible.

3
00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:09.088
In this interview, Steven talks about

4
00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.873
the tyranny of the Jesuit order throughout history

5
00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:13.941
and the unified story of these times

6
00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:16.235
as laid out in a myriad of religious texts

7
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:17.770
and historical texts.

8
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.864
He tells us that this is the time of self-mastery

9
00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.821
and the time of self-healing.

10
00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:28.786 line:15% 
(soft music)

11
00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:34.506
Most everybody watching this has already seen

12
00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:37.718
our first interview with you from the previous month

13
00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:40.736
and we did get a little bit into

14
00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:41.888
what we're going to talk about now,

15
00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:43.723
which is the book that you've written called,

16
00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:46.229
Metaphysical Interpretations to the Bible.

17
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.960
As a little bit of background, you collect bibles.

18
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.941
<v ->Yes.</v>

19
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.863
<v Regina>And off camera we were having a conversation,</v>

20
00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:54.581
it's very interesting, as you say,

21
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.737
some of the bibles you have from times past

22
00:00:57.737 --> 00:00:59.999
are massive tomes, I mean,

23
00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.761
15 by 10 by five inches thick.

24
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.737
And then you look at what's in your Motel 6 drawer.

25
00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:09.481
You've got to think, something's been removed. (laughs)

26
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.710
<v ->A lot has actually been removed.</v>

27
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.564
<v Regina>And we want to talk,</v>

28
00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:14.845
you talk a lot abut what's been removed

29
00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.352
and what's been respun and why

30
00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:18.002
<v Steven>Yes.</v>
<v Regina>these things</v>

31
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.830
have been removed in the metaphysical interpretations.

32
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.198
I hardly even know where to begin,

33
00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:25.916
because this is a massive tome in itself.

34
00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:27.009
Beautiful.

35
00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.004
Let's start with, can I just toss out one subject?

36
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:32.359
And then we'll go into,

37
00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.215
you can structure the rest of the conversation.

38
00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:35.345
Help me with that.

39
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.182
One of the subjects is reincarnation.

40
00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:42.385
Which was in earlier editions of the Bible.

41
00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:44.496
I think there's some misinformation,

42
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:46.289
or misunderstanding as to when that was

43
00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.793
stricken from the Bible.

44
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.653
Can you talk about that subject alone as an example?

45
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.551
And why it was stricken?

46
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:57.434
<v ->Well, if it wasn't stricken the early churches</v>

47
00:01:57.434 --> 00:02:00.868
would not have had the level of power they desired to wield,

48
00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:03.045
because if all the humans had been taught,

49
00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.370
in fact, Christianity is the only people that are

50
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.134
really taught that you're born and you die and that's it.

51
00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:12.292
And if people really took a moment in time

52
00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:17.241
to consider that what creator would create life

53
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.337
to give it a glimmer or moment in time

54
00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:24.474
and then throw it in a black box forever?

55
00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:26.372
That would be cruel and unusual punishment

56
00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:30.143
and I'm sure the ACLU would have an issue with that.

57
00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:34.116
But it was originally removed so it would

58
00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:35.535
give the church some clout.

59
00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.486
They had to have clout because

60
00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:40.644
they created the notion of the idea of God and the devil,

61
00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:43.518
so we had to have a punishment spectrum.

62
00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.001
And that if there was reincarnation,

63
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.284
who would give two hoots and a wind to either?

64
00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:52.569
And interestingly enough, the greater faction of the world

65
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.639
believes in reincarnation.

66
00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.027
And the smaller faction doesn't.

67
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.564
When we look at older bibles,

68
00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:00.931
my oldest being 1817,

69
00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:06.023
there are no less than 178 references to reincarnation.

70
00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Regina>And that was just a short time ago,</v>

71
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.807
less than 200 years ago.

72
00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:09.873
<v ->That is correct.</v>

73
00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:12.113
In fact, a lot of people don't realize it,

74
00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:13.852
we didn't get an American version of the Bible

75
00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:15.526
until 1901.

76
00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:18.033
Just a little over 100 years ago.

77
00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:19.259
And when you look at that version

78
00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.353
versus the original types, King James,

79
00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:25.531
and King James, by the way, has its basis in,

80
00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:28.741
and all religious texts are based on King James,

81
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.851
He's the only one that wasn't killed

82
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:32.635
because he was a king and the other two prior to that,

83
00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:34.448
one was burned as a heretic.

84
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:39.448
He was interpreting the Latin text into a German text

85
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.348
so Germans could read it,

86
00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:43.546
he was literally burned at the stake as a heretic.

87
00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:46.895
The second one had his entire research library destroyed

88
00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:50.564
and he was defamed and ended up dying as a pauper.

89
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.612
The third one was King James.

90
00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:57.612
His was based on known texts and renegade texts,

91
00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:01.112
which now gives us the modern-day version of the Bible.

92
00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:03.394
But when the text was originally formed,

93
00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:05.486
they wanted to reword,

94
00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:09.261
which is why only the priests could have a Bible,

95
00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:11.448
the lay people couldn't.

96
00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:14.285
The priests knew that reincarnation was there

97
00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.696
and what they ultimately did was weed it out

98
00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:19.789
until today, in the 1901 version of the Bible,

99
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.366
there are only three references

100
00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.057
to reincarnation.

101
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.632
Two of them uttered by Christ.

102
00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:29.697
The other one was when King Nebuchadnezzar

103
00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.971
was turned, because of his cruelty to his people,

104
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:35.776
was turned into a, as though a cow grazing

105
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:39.424
off the grasses of the land for seven lifetimes.

106
00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:40.821
<v Regina>Mm-hmm, seven life times.</v>

107
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:42.027
<v ->So he was pretty special, I guess.</v>

108
00:04:42.027 --> 00:04:44.490
He got to be a cow for seven times.

109
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.139
But there's one of the references right there.

110
00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:50.975
Again, the church was after power.

111
00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:52.393
And that's what they're all about anyway.

112
00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:54.366
I mean, if people really stopped and thought about it,

113
00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:56.627
and I talk about it in the history portion,

114
00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:59.551
is that if you look at the top five wealthiest organizations

115
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.322
in the entire Earth,

116
00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:03.359
guess who's in the top five?

117
00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:05.407
<v Regina>Well, I assume the Catholic Church has got to be</v>

118
00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:07.102
number one or two, right?
<v Steven>It's one of them.</v>

119
00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:09.096
It's actually number four.

120
00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Regina>Number four, who are the--</v>

121
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.136
<v ->The Baptists are in there and the Mormons are in there.</v>

122
00:05:12.136 --> 00:05:13.160
<v Regina>Mormons are number one?</v>

123
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.906
<v ->No.</v>

124
00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:15.090
<v Regina>Who's number one?</v>

125
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.178
Can't be the Lutherans.

126
00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:19.297
<v ->No, it's actually an American corporation.</v>

127
00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:24.221
But one and two, or one, last I looked is,

128
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:25.640
when I was doing the research,

129
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.058
number one was an American corporation,

130
00:05:27.058 --> 00:05:28.936
number two was a German corporation,

131
00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:31.719
and then the other three rounding out the top five

132
00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.234
were religious organizations.

133
00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:34.599
<v Regina>That's very interesting.</v>

134
00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.966
<v ->Mormons were number three, Catholics number four,</v>

135
00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:38.012
and Baptists were number five.

136
00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Regina>That surprises me.</v>

137
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.942
I wouldn't have guessed that.

138
00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:41.543
I would have thought the Catholics were--

139
00:05:41.543 --> 00:05:43.451
<v ->Well, they probably were until all of the lawsuits.</v>

140
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.908
<v Regina>Well, that has diminished their value</v>

141
00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:48.668
on the stock market.

142
00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:50.737
But, I was going to say,

143
00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:55.103
it was our understanding that the Vatican,

144
00:05:57.338 --> 00:06:00.117
they own American Express.

145
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.886
<v ->You'd be amazed at what they own.</v>

146
00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:07.066
<v Regina>Yes, it's a very interesting kind of spin</v>

147
00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.389
it all puts on it.

148
00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:09.317
What's interesting though,

149
00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:12.154
looking at it from a business point of view,

150
00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:15.472
paying your bill off each month so you don't incur interest,

151
00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:18.650
which originally American Express was the only card

152
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.710
that insisted that you pay it off and not incur interest,

153
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.439
then it started moving into the normal system

154
00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.084
where it incurs interest and debt

155
00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:28.175
and so forth, like the others.

156
00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:29.871
I thought about it a little.

157
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.423
<v ->Now they have your soul indebted to the church</v>

158
00:06:33.423 --> 00:06:36.366
and now your pocketbook and your physical self.

159
00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:38.596
So hey, they're gaining ground, but whatever.

160
00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:39.661
<v Regina>Most people don't know that.</v>

161
00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:40.866
I found that interesting.

162
00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:43.385
So let's go back on that.

163
00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:47.096
So we're talking about, it takes a good deal

164
00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:49.346
of the heaping on of guilt

165
00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:52.600
in order to be able to accrue that amount of wealth.

166
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.453
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

167
00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:54.691
<v Regina>You have to keep people paying</v>

168
00:06:54.691 --> 00:06:56.013
for their salvation.

169
00:06:56.013 --> 00:06:57.474
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

170
00:06:57.474 --> 00:06:59.682
But you've got to ask yourself a question.

171
00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:01.346
Saving you from what?

172
00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:02.114
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

173
00:07:02.114 --> 00:07:02.860
<v ->Yourself?</v>

174
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.214
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Steven>Hmm.</v>

175
00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:06.487
<v Regina>Hell and damnation.</v>

176
00:07:06.487 --> 00:07:07.511
<v ->Ah.</v>

177
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:09.111
You know what's really funny about that?

178
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:10.039
<v Regina>And Satan.</v>

179
00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.692
Would you give the definition of Satan?

180
00:07:11.692 --> 00:07:13.504
I find this really interesting.

181
00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:14.433
<v ->Yes, I will.</v>

182
00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.406
If we look into ancient Sanskrit, and Satan as

183
00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:19.265
a very viable word in Sanskrit,

184
00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:21.334
it actually interprets into ego.

185
00:07:21.334 --> 00:07:22.207
The Tempter
<v Regina>Isn't that</v>

186
00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:23.232
interesting?

187
00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:24.702
<v ->And you can actually see that written in a Biblical text.</v>

188
00:07:24.702 --> 00:07:27.576
The Tempter or the Taunter.

189
00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:32.339
And when you find it in ancient Sanskrit,

190
00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:33.854
and even in ancient Aramaic,

191
00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.517
it actually represents,

192
00:07:35.517 --> 00:07:38.355
you get a definition very literally, the ego.

193
00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:39.890
So what the Catholic Church and any church

194
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.160
is attempting to say to you is

195
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.463
they want to save you from your own ego.

196
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.605
Well, that's not possible either.

197
00:07:46.498 --> 00:07:48.075
Either way they lose.

198
00:07:48.075 --> 00:07:50.379
And even if people really considered it,

199
00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:52.112
even Christians, bless their hearts,

200
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.882
Christ himself says that a house divided

201
00:07:55.882 --> 00:07:58.016
cannot stand against itself.

202
00:07:58.016 --> 00:08:00.500
But when we look at what religion does,

203
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.922
it teaches in division right off the bat,

204
00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:05.216
because you have God and you have the devil.

205
00:08:05.216 --> 00:08:07.979
And people also have to ask themselves another question.

206
00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:10.346
Why would this thing that we term as the creator

207
00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:12.309
create its own archenemy that's so great

208
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:14.005
it's not even sure it can beat it.

209
00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:16.628
And then it's gonna play a game with the human

210
00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:17.833
as a ping pong ball.

211
00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:21.941
And here these two are having fun.

212
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:22.825
No.

213
00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:23.870
And the other thing is,

214
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.844
is I can ask the creator to show up

215
00:08:25.844 --> 00:08:28.276
and it does every single second of every single day.

216
00:08:28.276 --> 00:08:32.255
And right here in this interview I say this,

217
00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:34.270
Devil, if you're out there, come on

218
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.892
big, red guy with your pitchfork,

219
00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:36.756
I'll take you on.

220
00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:37.802
You leave everybody else alone.

221
00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:38.686
And you know what?

222
00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:40.467
It never shows up.

223
00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:42.842
It never has and it never will.

224
00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:45.161
<v Regina>But for some people,</v>

225
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.626
it shows up every day.

226
00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:49.204
of their own creation.

227
00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:51.370
<v ->By their own creation and their own choosing, absolutely.</v>

228
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.275
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

229
00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:54.548
And that's what it's really all about.

230
00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:56.051
<v ->We're actually told,</v>

231
00:08:56.051 --> 00:08:57.960
my teachers taught me in the monasteries,

232
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.397
and we're actually told in every single text,

233
00:09:01.397 --> 00:09:03.306
not just the Bible alone,

234
00:09:03.306 --> 00:09:06.762
that you will get whatever you give your power to.

235
00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:09.107
And if we go back, and we have to understand,

236
00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:11.849
what we're dealing with in today's modern world

237
00:09:11.849 --> 00:09:15.710
is 1,600 years of conditioning,

238
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.758
fear-based conditioning,

239
00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.400
and ridicule.

240
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.816
A lot of people don't realize it, but,

241
00:09:23.422 --> 00:09:26.205
I believe it was 1837 in Spain

242
00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:28.946
was when the last torture and death occurred

243
00:09:28.946 --> 00:09:31.563
because of the Inquisitions.

244
00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:36.497
So from 900 ACE to 1835,

245
00:09:36.497 --> 00:09:39.164
at the hands of the Catholic Church,

246
00:09:39.164 --> 00:09:41.666
there were 10 million plus people

247
00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:44.364
that were tortured, dismembered, disfigured,

248
00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:47.307
and killed for being heretics.

249
00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:49.333
Do you realize that Galileo himself

250
00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.862
was almost burned at the stake for being a heretic,

251
00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.837
because he was the one that realized that the sun

252
00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:57.185
actually did not go around the Earth,

253
00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.582
that the Earth went around the sun.

254
00:09:58.582 --> 00:10:00.714
And here's a man that's now considered

255
00:10:00.714 --> 00:10:02.923
one of the fathers of astronomy

256
00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:05.365
that died as a heretical pauper,

257
00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:06.794
beggar on the streets,

258
00:10:06.794 --> 00:10:08.837
at the hands of the Catholic Church.

259
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:11.764
The original Catholic Church.

260
00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:15.360
And the thing that gave them the greatest grip

261
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.270
is every king and fiefdom,

262
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.309
and I have the book in my office,

263
00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:21.535
I can show it to you.

264
00:10:21.535 --> 00:10:24.606
It's the Loyal Order of the Jesuits.

265
00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:27.721
They are the internal affairs and CIA

266
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:28.712
of the Catholic Church.

267
00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.641
<v Regina>I've read their oath.</v>

268
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:31.326
It's frightening.
<v Steven>Absolutely.</v>

269
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:34.217
But they would go to a king and say,

270
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.773
would you like to become wealthy?

271
00:10:35.773 --> 00:10:37.746
And the king, of course, would say yes.

272
00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:40.093
And then what they did is they used their fear tactics

273
00:10:40.093 --> 00:10:42.270
of the devil, going to Hell, and the Catholic Church

274
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.196
could save them.

275
00:10:43.196 --> 00:10:44.530
Then they started levying taxes,

276
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.589
threatening them to lose their land and property.

277
00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:48.886
What are these people in the Dark Ages gonna do?

278
00:10:49.777 --> 00:10:51.472
They either had to go along with the Church

279
00:10:51.472 --> 00:10:53.723
or lose their family,

280
00:10:53.723 --> 00:10:54.908
their livelihoods,

281
00:10:54.908 --> 00:10:59.014
their farms, their money, and their lives.

282
00:10:59.014 --> 00:11:02.641
So for basically 900 plus years,

283
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:06.491
that's the tactic that the early Catholic Church utilized.

284
00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:09.642
And it was only the Catholic Church until Martin Luther,

285
00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:11.899
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Steven>in the late 1400s,</v>

286
00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:16.752
when he literally nailed his treatise

287
00:11:16.752 --> 00:11:21.370
on the door of a Catholic Church in France.

288
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.322
And then the Lutherans were born,

289
00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:25.061
Protestants came about.

290
00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:29.657
But all of them have their basis in the exact same book,

291
00:11:29.657 --> 00:11:31.982
which is used to guilt-trip everybody.

292
00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:34.136
In fact, in India Sri Ramakrishna says

293
00:11:34.136 --> 00:11:37.135
that if you say it to yourself enough that you're a sinner

294
00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:38.531
then you soon will be.

295
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.533
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

296
00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:40.484
Exactly.

297
00:11:40.484 --> 00:11:43.012
Very powerful words.

298
00:11:43.012 --> 00:11:46.265
And so the Catholic Church really,

299
00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:47.823
their bedfellows were all the power structures

300
00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:49.582
that they could possible permeate.

301
00:11:49.582 --> 00:11:50.628
<v ->Totally.</v>

302
00:11:50.628 --> 00:11:52.696
Only at the sake of money.

303
00:11:52.696 --> 00:11:53.368
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

304
00:11:53.368 --> 00:11:55.129
<v ->Chapter four in that one book</v>

305
00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:56.152
that I just mentioned to you,

306
00:11:56.152 --> 00:11:59.007
the Order of the Jesuit Priests.

307
00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:02.276
And if people really thought about it in a historical sense,

308
00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:06.233
every time an explorer ship came to the New World,

309
00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:07.951
it always had a priest on board.

310
00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:09.433
Guess who he was.

311
00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:10.435
A Jesuit.

312
00:12:10.435 --> 00:12:11.151
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

313
00:12:11.151 --> 00:12:13.316
<v ->To establish the wealth and the belief system</v>

314
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.651
of the country that were invading.

315
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:17.977
<v Regina>Invading is the right word, as a matter of fact.</v>

316
00:12:17.977 --> 00:12:20.871
We just posted the

317
00:12:22.732 --> 00:12:23.800
oath.

318
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.661
We got ahold of one of the original documents

319
00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:31.490
of the Jesuit oath from the early 1900s.

320
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.645
And I believe that the main constituents of that

321
00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:36.204
still exist to this day when taking the oath.

322
00:12:36.204 --> 00:12:39.895
And we posted it to the site recently for people to

323
00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:43.287
peruse and begin an understanding what's actually happened.

324
00:12:43.287 --> 00:12:46.444
How does this, in the broadest terms,

325
00:12:46.444 --> 00:12:49.941
reflect itself in our world today.

326
00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:53.942
Even today in the state that we find the United States in,

327
00:12:53.942 --> 00:12:58.294
in terms of having given away any authentic power

328
00:12:58.294 --> 00:13:01.429
to all externals, not just the church,

329
00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:04.427
in fear of Hell and damnation,

330
00:13:04.427 --> 00:13:07.051
but in terms of the corporate world.

331
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:10.560
Giving ourselves to the notion that

332
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.756
we're not enough in every single way.

333
00:13:12.756 --> 00:13:14.816
I mean, there's almost no way in which we are enough

334
00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:17.101
if you're to watch a day of television.

335
00:13:18.835 --> 00:13:20.084
<v ->Um.</v>

336
00:13:20.084 --> 00:13:22.311
<v Regina>How far does it go?</v>

337
00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:27.266
<v ->(laughing) You can not go anywhere</v>

338
00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:29.879
where it isn't there first.

339
00:13:31.507 --> 00:13:33.042
Unless you go to a monastery.

340
00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:35.272
And it saddens me a great deal,

341
00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:38.055
because if we were to finger anything in our world

342
00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:40.940
that has created illusion,

343
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.193
it would be the idea and notion of religion.

344
00:13:44.193 --> 00:13:45.931
That even feeds business.

345
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:48.673
You would be amazed at what the Catholic Church

346
00:13:48.673 --> 00:13:51.873
and religions have their fingers in.

347
00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.568
Do you know that the majority of the orange groves

348
00:13:53.568 --> 00:13:57.610
in the state of Florida are owned by the Mormon church?

349
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.753
<v Regina>I had no idea.</v>

350
00:13:58.753 --> 00:14:00.074
<v ->Totally.</v>

351
00:14:00.074 --> 00:14:01.184
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

352
00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:03.947
<v ->And these are all not-for-profit organizations,</v>

353
00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:06.432
and yet you'd be amazed at the businesses

354
00:14:06.432 --> 00:14:08.340
and the real estate that they wield.

355
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.824
<v Regina>I've seen a little bit of that.</v>

356
00:14:09.824 --> 00:14:12.149
<v ->Why do you think most of our politicians</v>

357
00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:14.991
belly-up to the religions the way that they do?

358
00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:18.016
The control that it actually has.

359
00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:18.996
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

360
00:14:18.996 --> 00:14:19.851
Financial control.

361
00:14:19.851 --> 00:14:21.525
Contributions, really simply put.

362
00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:23.541
<v ->Still control of the wealth,</v>

363
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:26.399
control of the minds, the hearts, the bodies and souls

364
00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.861
of humankind.

365
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:31.070
<v Regina>How does this relate to to say India for example?</v>

366
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.386
You go into the larger cities of India now

367
00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:35.455
and you're looking at the same patterns

368
00:14:35.455 --> 00:14:38.591
starting to occur in the younger generations.

369
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:42.207
Bars and discos and consumption and Gap

370
00:14:42.207 --> 00:14:43.167
and you name it,

371
00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:44.973
every franchise on the street.

372
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:47.223
Now how did this happen?

373
00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.963
<v ->It's just taken centuries.</v>

374
00:14:50.963 --> 00:14:52.424
for it to all catch up.

375
00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.120
But one of the things that people don't realize is

376
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.264
is this is no coincidence in any of this, Regina.

377
00:14:56.264 --> 00:14:57.555
<v Regina>Right, and I'd like you to explain</v>

378
00:14:57.555 --> 00:14:58.785
why there's not.

379
00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:01.318
<v ->Well, everything happens for a reason.</v>

380
00:15:01.318 --> 00:15:02.737
And what we don't understand is

381
00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:05.522
we tend to think governments are in control.

382
00:15:05.522 --> 00:15:08.785
Let me maybe seemingly drift off the subject,

383
00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:09.831
but not really.

384
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:12.987
Let's look at the metaphor behind the idea of Katrina.

385
00:15:12.987 --> 00:15:14.630
What really happened there?

386
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.950
Other than a hurricane wiping out a city?

387
00:15:17.638 --> 00:15:20.464
That was the universe's way of saying,

388
00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:23.227
you're relying on the wrong things.

389
00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:26.597
What you're trusting that will take care of you cannot.

390
00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:27.526
Let's take another one.

391
00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:28.624
Sumatra.

392
00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:29.456
You've got to ask yourself,

393
00:15:29.456 --> 00:15:31.781
out of all of those people that lost their lives

394
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:33.819
in that massive tsunami and earthquake,

395
00:15:33.819 --> 00:15:36.932
why were they predominantly the children?

396
00:15:36.932 --> 00:15:39.184
Simple, metaphorically,

397
00:15:39.184 --> 00:15:40.742
it was the universe's way of saying,

398
00:15:40.742 --> 00:15:43.142
"Wake up, your innocence is being taken."

399
00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:45.787
Now let's go back to your question of India and China.

400
00:15:45.787 --> 00:15:47.973
The same thing is taking place and yet

401
00:15:47.973 --> 00:15:50.267
we're so caught up in physical nature

402
00:15:50.267 --> 00:15:51.706
that we're not paying attention to what

403
00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:54.405
the metaphorical language is being shown to us.

404
00:15:54.405 --> 00:15:57.028
If Mother Nature or the Creator is going to speak,

405
00:15:57.028 --> 00:15:58.606
it's not going to say, "Hello Regina,

406
00:15:58.606 --> 00:16:01.274
"you'd better duck because here comes the cannon ball."

407
00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:04.942
It's gonna knock you down, so that you don't become hurt.

408
00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:07.055
That's just the way it operates.

409
00:16:07.055 --> 00:16:08.590
It doesn't use linguistics.

410
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.703
So we're being shown all over the place

411
00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:13.369
that what we're trusting is very erroneous.

412
00:16:13.369 --> 00:16:15.641
Because we've been led away from our true selves.

413
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.294
Even if you look at the idea of religion.

414
00:16:17.294 --> 00:16:19.939
We're taught this concept.

415
00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:21.401
God created our world,

416
00:16:21.401 --> 00:16:22.659
it created humankind,

417
00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:24.952
and then it went, "Oh gross, I made a mistake,

418
00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:26.136
"I'm outta here, I'm going to

419
00:16:26.136 --> 00:16:27.811
"somewhere else in the universe."

420
00:16:27.811 --> 00:16:29.155
Excuse me.

421
00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.103
You as a parent, you wouldn't do that to your children.

422
00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:33.784
Neither would it to us.

423
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:35.149
And it didn't.

424
00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:36.567
Which is why Christ said what he said

425
00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:38.872
in the book of Matthew.

426
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.589
When we look at any of the Biblical texts,

427
00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:44.344
and our taping in our last--

428
00:16:44.344 --> 00:16:47.057
<v Regina>Please refer again to Matthew.</v>

429
00:16:48.343 --> 00:16:50.060
You were just a moment ago.

430
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.404
<v ->Oh, okay.</v>

431
00:16:51.404 --> 00:16:52.865
In the book of Matthew Christ says,

432
00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:55.104
you look here and you look there for the kingdom of heaven.

433
00:16:55.104 --> 00:16:57.920
Do you yet not realize that it is within you?

434
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.289
And as indicated in our last taping,

435
00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:03.232
if God is in heaven, then that means it's within us,

436
00:17:03.232 --> 00:17:06.762
and every ancient teaching tells us that very idea.

437
00:17:06.762 --> 00:17:08.928
And one of the things that I've done in a metaphysical

438
00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:10.315
interpretation of the Bible is

439
00:17:10.315 --> 00:17:15.029
I've taken the metaphorical language and have laid it out

440
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:17.311
and said this is what he's telling you.

441
00:17:17.311 --> 00:17:18.954
Even if you look at just something as simple

442
00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:21.696
as the seven points of the Sermon on the Mount.

443
00:17:21.696 --> 00:17:23.317
I don't care what religion says,

444
00:17:23.317 --> 00:17:24.852
you can find it in the Nag Hammadi,

445
00:17:24.852 --> 00:17:28.030
there are only seven parables quoted by Christ.

446
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.357
There are seven meditations of Christ.

447
00:17:30.357 --> 00:17:33.257
There are seven letters to the seven churches.

448
00:17:34.294 --> 00:17:36.961
There's the seven angels, the seven trumpets.

449
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:38.497
What does all of that mean?

450
00:17:38.497 --> 00:17:39.999
In a nutshell,

451
00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:44.437
he's saying if you wish to be as I,

452
00:17:44.437 --> 00:17:48.267
then clean your energy centers.

453
00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.402
The seven points of the Sermon on the Mount,

454
00:17:51.402 --> 00:17:53.653
they're related in a metaphysical interpretation

455
00:17:53.653 --> 00:17:55.339
of the Bible, this is the chakra.

456
00:17:55.339 --> 00:17:56.160
Here's what he said,

457
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.013
here's what he's saying,

458
00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:58.037
here's what it relates to,

459
00:17:58.037 --> 00:17:59.061
and here's why.

460
00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:01.033
You take a translation as example,

461
00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:04.628
"They that seek righteousness shall see the kingdom."

462
00:18:04.628 --> 00:18:07.272
Interestingly enough, the ancient Aramaic word

463
00:18:07.272 --> 00:18:09.226
has two translations.

464
00:18:09.226 --> 00:18:11.630
Righteous or truth.

465
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.817
Those that seek truth will see the kingdom.

466
00:18:15.817 --> 00:18:16.744
That was his message.

467
00:18:16.744 --> 00:18:19.250
And interestingly enough, that's the fourth,

468
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.298
and he's relating that to the heart.

469
00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:24.082
Seek truth in what you feel

470
00:18:24.082 --> 00:18:25.875
and you will find the kingdom.

471
00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:27.943
Because if the kingdom is within you,

472
00:18:27.943 --> 00:18:29.096
what's the heart of the human?

473
00:18:29.096 --> 00:18:30.099
That's God.

474
00:18:30.099 --> 00:18:32.232
Once more, he's leading us right to it.

475
00:18:32.232 --> 00:18:35.388
But what the early churches and the early translations did,

476
00:18:35.388 --> 00:18:37.873
is they exerted everything through the idea

477
00:18:37.873 --> 00:18:40.913
of power and control and led us away.

478
00:18:40.913 --> 00:18:42.801
Let's see, that same great individual,

479
00:18:42.801 --> 00:18:45.958
that Christ said, if the blind follow the blind,

480
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.905
should they both not fall in the ditch?

481
00:18:48.902 --> 00:18:49.926
And what have we done?

482
00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:52.560
We've fallen in a huge crevice.

483
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.203
<v Regina>Absolutely, and is this a part</v>

484
00:18:54.203 --> 00:18:55.301
of a larger hand?

485
00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:58.373
This certainly has moved beyond

486
00:18:58.373 --> 00:19:00.464
the original priests and kings.

487
00:19:00.464 --> 00:19:02.843
Now it permeates all lands, all cultures,

488
00:19:02.843 --> 00:19:03.909
all things.

489
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.298
How does this continue perpetuating itself?

490
00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:09.040
Is this by design or by default?

491
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.816
<v ->By design.</v>

492
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.012
And I'm gonna say creator driven

493
00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:15.019
and creator design.

494
00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:16.794
Us humans are interesting.

495
00:19:17.728 --> 00:19:20.565
We can learn things in a very simple context.

496
00:19:20.565 --> 00:19:22.144
Or not.

497
00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:25.635
We seem to choose to learn things the difficult way.

498
00:19:27.294 --> 00:19:30.058
People kind of wig out when they hear me say

499
00:19:30.058 --> 00:19:31.892
what I'm about to.

500
00:19:31.892 --> 00:19:33.748
You're the creator once again, Regina,

501
00:19:33.748 --> 00:19:35.859
and you sent us, as religion puts it,

502
00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:37.000
your only begotten.

503
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.374
Which is balderdash, so to speak.

504
00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:41.470
And what happened?

505
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.836
Known as the Prince of Peace.

506
00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:44.308
Well, he got killed.

507
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:45.236
Right?

508
00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.419
Okay, well, let's see.

509
00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:47.838
You as the creator, "Well, that didn't work.

510
00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:48.733
"Now what do I do?

511
00:19:48.733 --> 00:19:49.874
"Oh, I know.

512
00:19:49.874 --> 00:19:52.332
"Let's give them Hitler, see what he does."

513
00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:54.957
Well, that didn't work.

514
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:56.990
Okay.

515
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.003
You showed peace.

516
00:19:58.003 --> 00:20:00.052
You showed implicit destruction.

517
00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:02.258
Implicit cruelty, and that didn't work.

518
00:20:02.258 --> 00:20:04.018
"Okay, you'll figure it out

519
00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:06.121
"and I'm gonna watch.

520
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:07.390
"I've got eternity

521
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.576
"and I know you're gonna catch up to me sooner or later

522
00:20:09.576 --> 00:20:11.923
"so I'm just gonna let you do that on your own."

523
00:20:11.923 --> 00:20:13.385
So what we're seeing in our world,

524
00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:16.424
I do in January of every year,

525
00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.998
I do a thing, predictions for the year.

526
00:20:19.998 --> 00:20:21.927
And every year, the person doing the interviewing

527
00:20:21.927 --> 00:20:25.992
will ask me, "If you were to put this in one word,

528
00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:28.637
"what would you call 2008?"

529
00:20:28.637 --> 00:20:31.026
The year of exposure.

530
00:20:31.026 --> 00:20:32.914
And we're seeing it everywhere.

531
00:20:32.914 --> 00:20:34.214
<v Regina>Everywhere.</v>
<v Steven>Alright.</v>

532
00:20:34.214 --> 00:20:35.655
So what comes next?

533
00:20:35.655 --> 00:20:37.533
The realization of truth.

534
00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:39.782
Ah, now we're getting somewhere.

535
00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:41.851
You see, to me what we're actually witnessing

536
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:44.678
in the world today is precisely what Revelations says,

537
00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:46.215
but it's not the end times.

538
00:20:46.215 --> 00:20:48.881
What we're seeing is the awakening of human

539
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:50.278
into its true nature,

540
00:20:50.278 --> 00:20:52.156
its own divine nature.

541
00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:53.990
What we're seeing is the divine feminine

542
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.761
re-exerting herself.

543
00:20:55.761 --> 00:20:58.193
You see, when the Catholic Church founded,

544
00:20:58.193 --> 00:20:59.513
it cut the creator in half.

545
00:20:59.513 --> 00:21:00.837
How do we know that?

546
00:21:00.837 --> 00:21:03.599
Something that was suggested to at our last meeting.

547
00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:07.299
They let us create human in our image and in our likeness,

548
00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.135
both male and female.

549
00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:12.174
Alright, that says that the creator is both.

550
00:21:12.174 --> 00:21:13.871
So, it's basically androgynous.

551
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:15.012
It doesn't have either.

552
00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:19.171
So what it did, it split itself into two segments

553
00:21:19.171 --> 00:21:21.837
so it could reunify itself at some future point

554
00:21:21.837 --> 00:21:24.835
through the experience of the epitome of feel

555
00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:26.754
and the epitome of mind.

556
00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:27.875
Alright?

557
00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:29.219
Even if you look anywhere in our world,

558
00:21:29.219 --> 00:21:30.423
there are only two energies.

559
00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:32.259
There's a feminine and there's a masculine.

560
00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:34.028
Night's feminine, day is masculine.

561
00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:36.120
Moon is feminine, sun is masculine.

562
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.530
Air is feminine, ground is masculine.

563
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.313
Water is feminine, land is masculine.

564
00:21:41.313 --> 00:21:44.013
Earth is masculine, space is feminine.

565
00:21:44.013 --> 00:21:45.399
That's all there is.

566
00:21:45.399 --> 00:21:47.073
So what we're seeing is the reassertion,

567
00:21:47.073 --> 00:21:48.930
or the reunification.

568
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.095
Ancient prophecy tells us that society

569
00:21:51.095 --> 00:21:54.854
will go from patriarchal to matriarchal in context.

570
00:21:54.854 --> 00:21:58.148
And what we're seeing is the matriarchal part.

571
00:21:58.148 --> 00:21:58.959
Now,

572
00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:01.605
ancients used to write in matriarchal linguistics,

573
00:22:01.605 --> 00:22:03.600
right-brained metaphor.

574
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.437
What is the average human gonna do

575
00:22:06.437 --> 00:22:08.388
when it wakes up one morning and finds out

576
00:22:08.388 --> 00:22:10.335
its left-brain logic doesn't work?

577
00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:12.335
<v Regina>Celebrate?</v>

578
00:22:12.335 --> 00:22:13.914
<v ->Hopefully.
(Regina laughs)

579
00:22:13.914 --> 00:22:15.119
<v Regina>That would be good,</v>

580
00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.143
but I don't think so,

581
00:22:16.143 --> 00:22:17.050
I think it'll freak out.

582
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.371
<v ->Absolutely, in Revelation it says</v>

583
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:20.399
there will be three days of darkness.

584
00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:22.927
What Hollywood does is they portray that

585
00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:24.900
as gloom and doom.

586
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.595
Death, destruction.

587
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.889
Well, we overlooked something.

588
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:31.652
And what we overlooked was is in psychology

589
00:22:31.652 --> 00:22:34.050
they term insanity as darkness.

590
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.459
The point in Revelation is

591
00:22:35.459 --> 00:22:38.958
there's gonna be a period of three days of adjustment

592
00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.653
to where the mind and the human

593
00:22:40.653 --> 00:22:42.531
isn't going to function the way that we're

594
00:22:42.531 --> 00:22:44.578
accustomed to functioning.

595
00:22:44.578 --> 00:22:47.757
Because what it's gonna do is in the twinkling of an eye,

596
00:22:47.757 --> 00:22:50.658
is it's going to shift from left-brain schools of thought

597
00:22:50.658 --> 00:22:54.209
to right-brain, matriarchal taking place.

598
00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:56.279
<v Regina>Now that gets into a whole other area,</v>

599
00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:58.572
because you're talking about a shift in polarities.

600
00:22:58.572 --> 00:23:02.112
And there's much talk about a literal shift in polarities

601
00:23:02.112 --> 00:23:04.128
as through Edgar Cayce, for example,

602
00:23:04.128 --> 00:23:05.409
and others.

603
00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:07.637
The Mayans are now saying this is quite literal

604
00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:10.518
and impending, imminent.

605
00:23:10.518 --> 00:23:11.169
<v ->It is.</v>

606
00:23:11.169 --> 00:23:13.547
<v Regina>Possibly before 2012 even.</v>

607
00:23:13.547 --> 00:23:14.848
<v ->I've got news for you.</v>

608
00:23:14.848 --> 00:23:15.564
<v Regina>Let's talk about it.</v>

609
00:23:15.564 --> 00:23:16.194
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

610
00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:18.839
The modern Julian calendar is six years off.

611
00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:20.375
<v Regina>Okay, so.</v>

612
00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:21.485
<v ->Christ was actually born,</v>

613
00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:22.902
you gotta remember, the Julian calendar

614
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.694
was based on the birth of Christ.

615
00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:26.274
He was actually born six BC.

616
00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:27.499
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

617
00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:29.335
<v ->And here's an easy one.</v>

618
00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:33.269
They went from one BC to one AD.

619
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:34.710
Excuse me.

620
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.936
You dropped a year.

621
00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.451
So we know of one.

622
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:39.029
Well forensic archeologists determined

623
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:40.982
that there are five others.

624
00:23:40.982 --> 00:23:43.775
So we're actually in the cycle and phase of 2012.

625
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:45.471
In answer to your question,

626
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:49.397
there is a metaphorical and a literal representation.

627
00:23:49.397 --> 00:23:52.223
We already know, according to geophysics,

628
00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:56.404
that Earth's magnetic fields are shifting as we speak.

629
00:23:56.404 --> 00:23:59.615
And there's one thing everybody overlooks.

630
00:23:59.615 --> 00:24:04.297
The epiphany of an electromagnetic field is the human.

631
00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:05.599
Well, it would stand to reason

632
00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:08.916
if the poles do shift, as all prophecy,

633
00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:10.589
including the Mayans, indicate.

634
00:24:11.625 --> 00:24:14.291
And by the way, it has occurred 171 times

635
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:15.778
in the history of the Earth.

636
00:24:16.616 --> 00:24:17.725
Then that would stand to reason

637
00:24:17.725 --> 00:24:19.122
that the living, thinking, breathing thing

638
00:24:19.122 --> 00:24:22.600
that can realize at all is going to make a shift also.

639
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.955
And by the way,

640
00:24:23.955 --> 00:24:26.407
that occurs every 25,000 years.

641
00:24:26.407 --> 00:24:28.241
<v Regina>Precession of the equinox.</v>

642
00:24:28.241 --> 00:24:32.072
<v ->Did a radio show earlier in the year,</v>

643
00:24:32.072 --> 00:24:33.182
I believe in March, it was called,

644
00:24:33.182 --> 00:24:35.230
Global Warning.

645
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.106
Not global warming.

646
00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:39.869
Even ancient prophecy says that the Earth

647
00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:41.959
will become so hot that you will not

648
00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:44.178
be able to walk on it with your bare feet.

649
00:24:44.178 --> 00:24:45.800
Well, look around.

650
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.058
What's the cause?

651
00:24:47.058 --> 00:24:49.629
What's the highest, visual, seeable vibration

652
00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:51.347
that you can think of?

653
00:24:53.006 --> 00:24:54.724
<v Regina>I don't know what context to even put it in.</v>

654
00:24:54.724 --> 00:24:55.512
<v ->Fire.</v>

655
00:24:55.512 --> 00:24:56.420
<v Regina>Yes. Yes, okay.</v>

656
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.679
<v ->Heat.</v>

657
00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:58.863
Noah's flood.

658
00:24:58.863 --> 00:24:59.738
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

659
00:24:59.738 --> 00:25:00.835
<v ->Never existed.</v>

660
00:25:00.835 --> 00:25:02.066
Never happened.

661
00:25:02.926 --> 00:25:04.040
At all.

662
00:25:04.995 --> 00:25:06.637
There's no geological proof.

663
00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:07.576
<v Regina>No deluge.</v>

664
00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:08.621
<v ->No.</v>

665
00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:11.523
There's not enough water on planet Earth

666
00:25:11.523 --> 00:25:14.115
to create a global inundation.

667
00:25:14.115 --> 00:25:15.843
Period, end of story.

668
00:25:15.843 --> 00:25:17.345
Science, geology,

669
00:25:17.345 --> 00:25:18.903
has verified that.

670
00:25:18.903 --> 00:25:20.440
So what occurred?

671
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.474
Simple.

672
00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:22.668
Metaphorically,

673
00:25:22.668 --> 00:25:24.615
water represents spirit.

674
00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:27.330
The idea of spirit.

675
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.906
So there was a spiritual inundation.

676
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.676
So the metaphor says that during periods

677
00:25:33.676 --> 00:25:35.970
of spiritual inundation,

678
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.293
you must rise above.

679
00:25:37.293 --> 00:25:38.593
Jesus walking on water.

680
00:25:38.593 --> 00:25:39.479
He rose,

681
00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:42.102
he allowed spirit to lift his physical self.

682
00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.564
Just as Noah did.

683
00:25:43.564 --> 00:25:45.122
Now let's go back into the dynamics

684
00:25:45.122 --> 00:25:46.466
that are going on today.

685
00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:49.121
We're going through the same spiritual inundation.

686
00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:52.054
We're matching what the Maya say.

687
00:25:52.054 --> 00:25:54.518
There's only one difference this individual has

688
00:25:54.518 --> 00:25:56.842
than what archeology says.

689
00:25:56.842 --> 00:25:57.930
And I'm not an archeologist,

690
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.210
I fully admit that.

691
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.672
When we look at the Mayan calendar,

692
00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:03.748
it shows Quetzalcoatl descending into darkness.

693
00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:07.872
What people are saying is that's what we're gonna do

694
00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.301
in our modern era.

695
00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:10.123
No.

696
00:26:10.123 --> 00:26:11.818
I believe the thing that they've missed

697
00:26:11.818 --> 00:26:14.976
is that's that Quetzalcoatl and his generations did.

698
00:26:14.976 --> 00:26:17.066
They descended into darkness.

699
00:26:17.066 --> 00:26:19.508
This is all of birth, of rising us back

700
00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:21.716
into our own true divine nature.

701
00:26:21.716 --> 00:26:24.479
What's now, if we go through the entire Biblical text,

702
00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:26.825
that's exactly what Revelations is telling us.

703
00:26:26.825 --> 00:26:28.777
This is your experience.

704
00:26:28.777 --> 00:26:31.039
This is what you're gonna go through.

705
00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.819
And this is what it's going to give you.

706
00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:34.077
I challenge any human out there

707
00:26:34.077 --> 00:26:36.584
to read the very last chapter of the book of Revelation.

708
00:26:36.584 --> 00:26:38.857
And it flat says that there will never, ever be

709
00:26:38.857 --> 00:26:40.434
darkness.

710
00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:42.430
That you will all live in the light.

711
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.691
The light of understanding.

712
00:26:44.691 --> 00:26:47.026
The true divine sense of human.

713
00:26:47.026 --> 00:26:49.213
You see, we go through cycles of living

714
00:26:49.213 --> 00:26:50.888
in the idea of limitation.

715
00:26:50.888 --> 00:26:52.626
Thus the idea of religion.

716
00:26:52.626 --> 00:26:54.599
Here's your limitation.

717
00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:56.017
And then what it's going to do

718
00:26:56.017 --> 00:26:57.640
is release you and free you.

719
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.502
And to your true, infinite, divine self.

720
00:27:01.894 --> 00:27:04.215
Why do we live in limitation in the first place?

721
00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:06.434
We have a point of reference.

722
00:27:07.986 --> 00:27:09.149
When people come to me and they say,

723
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:12.721
"Steven, I would like to learn as a monk."

724
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:15.068
I ask them one question,

725
00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:16.806
"If you were a drop of water

726
00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:18.641
"and you landed into the ocean,

727
00:27:18.641 --> 00:27:20.427
"could you pull yourself out?"

728
00:27:22.193 --> 00:27:24.380
And if they say anything other than yes,

729
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.470
I will not assist them.

730
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.760
Here's why.

731
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.115
More times than not people say to me,

732
00:27:29.115 --> 00:27:30.534
"Well, why would you want to?"

733
00:27:30.534 --> 00:27:31.973
Can't work with that person.

734
00:27:31.973 --> 00:27:34.240
Secondly, "No, I cannot."

735
00:27:35.729 --> 00:27:37.542
So why ask that?

736
00:27:37.542 --> 00:27:40.182
If you cannot understand your own self

737
00:27:41.394 --> 00:27:44.945
as who you are, then you have no point of reference.

738
00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:48.268
Most people, when this cycle finally

739
00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:52.080
goes full impact,

740
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.288
they will have no point of reference.

741
00:27:54.288 --> 00:27:56.357
Thus the three days of insanity.

742
00:27:56.357 --> 00:27:57.489
Yet there are many people,

743
00:27:57.489 --> 00:28:00.161
every monk in this world will have a point of reference.

744
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.115
<v Regina>Care to share?</v>

745
00:28:04.092 --> 00:28:05.072
<v ->Self.</v>

746
00:28:05.072 --> 00:28:05.979
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

747
00:28:05.979 --> 00:28:07.121
<v ->Their fingerprint.</v>

748
00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:07.889
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

749
00:28:07.889 --> 00:28:09.812
<v ->Their own identity of being.</v>

750
00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.836
But they don't identify with bank account,

751
00:28:12.836 --> 00:28:15.375
clothes, hair, cars, house.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

752
00:28:15.375 --> 00:28:16.771
<v ->Those are lost.</v>

753
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:18.212
<v Regina>You know, as you were speaking,</v>

754
00:28:18.212 --> 00:28:19.396
what was occurring to me,

755
00:28:19.396 --> 00:28:21.432
is the people that would be seeking your help,

756
00:28:21.432 --> 00:28:25.198
because they want to go on another path, another journey,

757
00:28:25.198 --> 00:28:26.425
that of the monk,

758
00:28:26.425 --> 00:28:28.909
and you ask this question about the drop of water,

759
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:31.917
can you separate yourself from the sea?

760
00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:34.307
What is occurring to me is where now,

761
00:28:34.307 --> 00:28:37.816
there's almost a misunderstanding the other direction.

762
00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:40.184
That we are in a unified field.

763
00:28:40.184 --> 00:28:42.339
We're in a field of collective conciousness,

764
00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:43.778
that this is the right way,

765
00:28:43.778 --> 00:28:45.923
this is the only way and what's happened,

766
00:28:45.923 --> 00:28:50.540
in my mind, is that the whole aspect of self

767
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.226
is now being, again, sort of buried.

768
00:28:55.096 --> 00:28:57.996
But for a different reason and a different way.

769
00:28:57.996 --> 00:28:58.818
You see what I'm--

770
00:28:58.818 --> 00:29:00.416
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

771
00:29:00.416 --> 00:29:01.686
<v Regina>And so people would actually believe,</v>

772
00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:03.414
"No, I'm not supposed to separate myself

773
00:29:03.414 --> 00:29:06.773
"from the body of water, I am one with that sea.

774
00:29:06.773 --> 00:29:08.118
"We're all one."

775
00:29:08.118 --> 00:29:09.729
So that could have been a question that would be

776
00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:11.670
challenging for someone if they had already

777
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.551
bought in part way part way to that concept.

778
00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:17.600
<v ->It was Richard Bach, I believe, puts it best.</v>

779
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.362
That the human experience is though

780
00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:21.568
a wave cresting.

781
00:29:21.568 --> 00:29:24.287
And as a drop of water falls away from the wave,

782
00:29:24.287 --> 00:29:26.677
it ultimately lands back in the sea.

783
00:29:26.677 --> 00:29:28.042
And in a moment in time,

784
00:29:28.042 --> 00:29:29.694
they have individual experience,

785
00:29:29.694 --> 00:29:32.297
to never recognize itself again.

786
00:29:32.297 --> 00:29:34.015
The idea of divine nature,

787
00:29:34.015 --> 00:29:36.244
and the idea of individuality,

788
00:29:36.244 --> 00:29:38.516
is recognizing individual nature

789
00:29:38.516 --> 00:29:40.628
in the full consciousness of being.

790
00:29:40.628 --> 00:29:42.644
My teachers could not have contacted me

791
00:29:42.644 --> 00:29:45.970
directly from India had they not

792
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.550
had individual recognition.

793
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.056
Understand that when we talk about individual nature,

794
00:29:50.056 --> 00:29:52.584
it's not about separation.

795
00:29:52.584 --> 00:29:55.282
It's about unification with a whole,

796
00:29:55.282 --> 00:29:59.741
but realizing you are in a divine context,

797
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:01.757
part of the collective,

798
00:30:01.757 --> 00:30:04.168
and empowering the entire dynamic

799
00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:04.871
of the collective.
<v Regina>You have your</v>

800
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:06.256
fingerprint.
<v Steven>Yes, ma'am.</v>

801
00:30:06.256 --> 00:30:08.145
And that's exactly where

802
00:30:08.145 --> 00:30:09.275
Steven's coming from.
<v Regina>And not to forget</v>

803
00:30:09.275 --> 00:30:10.556
that we each have our fingerprint.

804
00:30:10.556 --> 00:30:12.646
This is not to lose ourself in the whole.

805
00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:14.321
<v ->That is correct.</v>

806
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:16.219
So when people say that this is,

807
00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:18.982
whoa, we're gonna ll lose it,

808
00:30:18.982 --> 00:30:20.095
good luck.

809
00:30:21.508 --> 00:30:23.397
Is my idea.

810
00:30:23.397 --> 00:30:26.075
When you look at monks in a monastery,

811
00:30:26.075 --> 00:30:27.408
they all shave their heads,

812
00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:28.913
and they all wear the same clothing.

813
00:30:28.913 --> 00:30:29.937
Why?

814
00:30:29.937 --> 00:30:31.792
It's to recognize individual nature

815
00:30:31.792 --> 00:30:34.257
in the idea of mass consciousness.

816
00:30:34.257 --> 00:30:35.857
Because they all have individuality,

817
00:30:35.857 --> 00:30:38.129
from the external sense they all look alike,

818
00:30:38.129 --> 00:30:40.337
but they are totally different.

819
00:30:40.337 --> 00:30:42.843
Within the context of their own selves.

820
00:30:42.843 --> 00:30:44.912
You see, the creator wouldn't have given us

821
00:30:44.912 --> 00:30:49.488
independent, individual idea of individual consciousness

822
00:30:49.488 --> 00:30:52.154
to put it into a big pool.

823
00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:54.265
To where it would not be able to--

824
00:30:54.265 --> 00:30:55.833
<v Regina>Indistinguishable.</v>

825
00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:56.942
How can you work on something that's

826
00:30:56.942 --> 00:30:58.927
indistinguishable from the rest?

827
00:30:58.927 --> 00:31:00.462
<v ->That is correct.</v>

828
00:31:00.462 --> 00:31:03.481
But as we get linked fully in the consciousness,

829
00:31:03.481 --> 00:31:06.051
and we're seeing that today,

830
00:31:06.051 --> 00:31:07.976
it's to lift it

831
00:31:08.985 --> 00:31:10.766
as individuals.

832
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:12.345
When you look at the Parthenon,

833
00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:16.205
one of the oldest still-standing buildings in our world,

834
00:31:16.205 --> 00:31:18.318
the pillars are individual,

835
00:31:18.318 --> 00:31:21.219
but collectively they've withstood the test of time.

836
00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:22.359
<v Regina>It's amazing.</v>

837
00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:24.835
<v ->And that's also part of it.</v>

838
00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:28.892
It's not to live in antagonistic nature with each other.

839
00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:32.526
If we really look at the idea of wholeness,

840
00:31:32.526 --> 00:31:35.330
you and I are implicitly equal,

841
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.165
along with every individual.

842
00:31:37.165 --> 00:31:38.424
The only difference is

843
00:31:38.424 --> 00:31:40.600
is how we're shaped and our paint job.

844
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.618
But internally, we're all exactly identical.

845
00:31:43.618 --> 00:31:46.178
And that's the only attribute of us that is.

846
00:31:46.178 --> 00:31:47.682
Is the organs.

847
00:31:47.682 --> 00:31:49.281
And we're all that special.

848
00:31:49.281 --> 00:31:51.489
And we're coming to that realization.

849
00:31:51.489 --> 00:31:52.866
In fact, one of the things presented

850
00:31:52.866 --> 00:31:54.838
in a metaphysical interpretation

851
00:31:54.838 --> 00:31:57.687
is my understanding of the four Gospels.

852
00:31:57.687 --> 00:32:00.481
Matthew represents physical self.

853
00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:02.753
Mark represents mental self.

854
00:32:02.753 --> 00:32:04.940
Luke represents emotional self.

855
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.673
And John is the representation of spiritual self.

856
00:32:08.673 --> 00:32:12.459
Those four represent the idea of Holy Trinity

857
00:32:12.459 --> 00:32:13.760
in union.

858
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.494
Father is the soul.

859
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:20.908
Excuse me, Holy Ghost is the soul.

860
00:32:20.908 --> 00:32:25.185
Father is the guiding input of the mind and emotions.

861
00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:26.689
And the Son is the body.

862
00:32:26.689 --> 00:32:28.620
That's actually what it is.

863
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.944
It's not this other amazing mumbo jumbo

864
00:32:30.944 --> 00:32:32.641
that the religions have thrown out there.

865
00:32:32.641 --> 00:32:34.027
At all.

866
00:32:34.027 --> 00:32:37.653
<v Regina>So you wrote this book as a document to empower.</v>

867
00:32:37.653 --> 00:32:40.832
I mean, obviously this is to help people break free

868
00:32:40.832 --> 00:32:42.688
of their chains of dogma.

869
00:32:42.688 --> 00:32:43.787
<v ->Yes, ma'am.</v>

870
00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:44.948
Yes, ma'am.

871
00:32:44.948 --> 00:32:46.133
<v Regina>And. I'm sorry, go ahead.</v>

872
00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:48.426
<v ->It's also to let you know who you are.</v>

873
00:32:48.426 --> 00:32:51.466
Once you realize your true nature,

874
00:32:51.466 --> 00:32:54.004
and you operate in that context,

875
00:32:54.004 --> 00:32:56.526
Regina, there's nothing you cannot do.

876
00:32:57.118 --> 00:32:59.827
Nothing can bind you, nothing can hold you.

877
00:32:59.827 --> 00:33:01.498
You become as air.

878
00:33:02.592 --> 00:33:04.895
And my challenge would be is allow me to see

879
00:33:04.895 --> 00:33:07.322
anyone that can grab air and hold it.

880
00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:11.786
Nothing will ever control that individual again.

881
00:33:11.786 --> 00:33:13.343
And you see, that's what the churches

882
00:33:13.343 --> 00:33:15.156
and the governmental entities of our world

883
00:33:15.156 --> 00:33:17.759
do not want us to know.

884
00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:20.051
<v Regina>And it seems to be ratcheting up by the day.</v>

885
00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:23.188
On the ground, in the trenches, as people start

886
00:33:23.188 --> 00:33:24.787
asking greater questions.

887
00:33:24.787 --> 00:33:25.885
Better questions.

888
00:33:25.885 --> 00:33:28.078
<v ->Better questions.
<v Regina>Better questions.</v>

889
00:33:29.972 --> 00:33:34.610
It seems as though the authorities of various kinds

890
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.321
come down even harder.

891
00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:38.749
<v ->They are coming down.</v>

892
00:33:38.749 --> 00:33:40.392
And we're seeing that everywhere.

893
00:33:40.392 --> 00:33:41.804
I did a documentary

894
00:33:43.186 --> 00:33:46.066
a while back, it's supposed to be released this fall.

895
00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:49.340
And one of the things that was posed by myself

896
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.732
in September 2006,

897
00:33:52.732 --> 00:33:54.396
were these things.

898
00:33:54.396 --> 00:33:56.801
What in our world is actually working?

899
00:33:57.948 --> 00:34:00.530
Are our governments working?

900
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.751
Are our corporations of the world working?

901
00:34:03.751 --> 00:34:06.395
Are our monetary systems working?

902
00:34:06.395 --> 00:34:08.401
Are our medical professions working?

903
00:34:08.401 --> 00:34:10.161
Our educational systems working?

904
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:11.975
Are our religions working?

905
00:34:11.975 --> 00:34:12.999
<v Regina>No.</v>

906
00:34:12.999 --> 00:34:13.991
<v ->To all of those.</v>

907
00:34:13.991 --> 00:34:15.783
<v Regina>Right.</v>

908
00:34:15.783 --> 00:34:17.169
<v ->And that's not to put fear into people,</v>

909
00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:19.633
it's to get them to realize that there's an absolutely

910
00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:23.121
wonderful awakening going on in our world.

911
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:25.766
Awakening to the truth of who we are.

912
00:34:25.766 --> 00:34:28.507
The reason for the book was to maybe put it in warp drive,

913
00:34:28.507 --> 00:34:30.128
to help it along.

914
00:34:30.128 --> 00:34:34.235
To say, this is what the ancients wanted us to know.

915
00:34:34.235 --> 00:34:36.613
This is what Christ himself wanted you

916
00:34:36.613 --> 00:34:38.864
as an individual to know.

917
00:34:38.864 --> 00:34:40.368
And what I've heard from people is

918
00:34:40.368 --> 00:34:43.321
they can pick up that book and they can open it

919
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:46.501
on any page and there's an answer

920
00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:48.612
to a question that they have.

921
00:34:48.612 --> 00:34:49.562
Was that a fluke?

922
00:34:49.562 --> 00:34:50.842
No.

923
00:34:50.842 --> 00:34:51.747
Did I plan that?

924
00:34:51.747 --> 00:34:52.628
No.

925
00:34:53.723 --> 00:34:54.714
<v Regina>You brought it through.</v>

926
00:34:54.714 --> 00:34:55.717
<v ->Yes.</v>

927
00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:57.113
<v Regina>And it's unifying.</v>

928
00:34:57.113 --> 00:34:57.850
<v ->Yes.</v>

929
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.760
<v Regina>It's unifying on many levels.</v>

930
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.688
<v ->All levels.</v>

931
00:35:00.688 --> 00:35:01.733
<v Regina>Yes, on all levels.</v>

932
00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:03.408
It's a work of unification.

933
00:35:03.408 --> 00:35:05.349
<v ->Which is why in that book,</v>

934
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:08.421
the idea of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

935
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:11.717
were broken down into the four factions that we did.

936
00:35:11.717 --> 00:35:12.733
And by the way,

937
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:17.326
the task offered to the early people

938
00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:19.576
formalizing the Bible

939
00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:21.564
was to select four males.

940
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.069
It had to be four direct disciples to Jesus.

941
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:26.808
Interestingly enough,

942
00:35:26.808 --> 00:35:28.166
two of them aren't.

943
00:35:29.196 --> 00:35:31.404
Matthew and John are the only two that were.

944
00:35:31.404 --> 00:35:34.076
Mark and Luke were apostles to Paul.

945
00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:36.727
So how did they end up in there?

946
00:35:36.727 --> 00:35:37.995
Hmm, who knows.

947
00:35:37.995 --> 00:35:39.948
But, no accident.

948
00:35:39.948 --> 00:35:42.945
They were chosen with purpose to address

949
00:35:42.945 --> 00:35:44.897
your physical experience, your mental experience,

950
00:35:44.897 --> 00:35:47.477
your emotional experience, and your spiritual experience.

951
00:35:47.477 --> 00:35:49.334
And how to unify them.

952
00:35:49.334 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Regina>What is the significance of the Gospel of Thomas?</v>

953
00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:55.787
<v ->Probably one of the greatest gospels of all time.</v>

954
00:35:55.787 --> 00:35:56.555
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

955
00:35:56.555 --> 00:36:00.181
And we don't find that, again, in the Gideon version.

956
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:01.364
<v ->No, of course not.</v>

957
00:36:01.364 --> 00:36:03.488
<v Regina>So let's talk about Gospel of Thomas</v>

958
00:36:03.488 --> 00:36:04.810
for a moment.

959
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.293
<v ->There were actually four people that originally</v>

960
00:36:06.293 --> 00:36:07.653
journeyed to India.

961
00:36:08.352 --> 00:36:09.770
There was Christ.

962
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.536
And by the way, Joseph of Arimathea was his uncle.

963
00:36:13.536 --> 00:36:15.295
And it was well known that he was trader

964
00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:17.129
and travelled to the Middle East all the time.

965
00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:18.473
And even when we look at the notion

966
00:36:18.473 --> 00:36:20.543
of the three wise men,

967
00:36:20.543 --> 00:36:22.964
they came from the Far East.

968
00:36:22.964 --> 00:36:25.609
Whoa, so there's already an eastern connection.

969
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:27.876
So Joseph of Arimathea took

970
00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:31.374
Jesus,

971
00:36:32.979 --> 00:36:36.387
Jesus' second cousin, John the Baptist,

972
00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:39.604
Thomas, one of his childhood friends,

973
00:36:39.604 --> 00:36:42.804
and his promised betrothed, Mary,

974
00:36:42.804 --> 00:36:45.486
they all went to India together.

975
00:36:46.248 --> 00:36:47.971
They're all written about over there.

976
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.896
And the reason Thomas got the name of Doubting Thomas

977
00:36:53.896 --> 00:36:57.469
is because he questioned his teachers more than anybody did.

978
00:36:57.469 --> 00:36:59.399
'Cause he wanted to know.

979
00:36:59.399 --> 00:37:01.095
And in fact, there's not much written about him,

980
00:37:01.095 --> 00:37:02.653
Thomas himself, in the Bible.

981
00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:05.224
But the Gospel of Thomas,

982
00:37:05.224 --> 00:37:06.872
when Christ was

983
00:37:09.106 --> 00:37:10.354
crucified, so to speak,

984
00:37:10.354 --> 00:37:12.285
and that's a story in itself,

985
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:16.068
all of the apostles were hunted down

986
00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:17.880
with the exception of a few.

987
00:37:19.054 --> 00:37:22.883
Thomas, Mary, and Peter went into Egypt

988
00:37:22.883 --> 00:37:24.643
and founded the Gnogstic sect.

989
00:37:24.643 --> 00:37:27.406
And the Gospel of Thomas is found in the Nag Hammadi,

990
00:37:27.406 --> 00:37:29.293
or Gnostic text.

991
00:37:29.293 --> 00:37:31.288
Along with the Gospel of Mary.

992
00:37:31.288 --> 00:37:33.422
And of course, Peter having a big ego,

993
00:37:33.422 --> 00:37:36.626
decided to take off and create his own thing.

994
00:37:37.304 --> 00:37:39.598
The Catholic Church, which we now know.

995
00:37:39.598 --> 00:37:41.177
But in the Gospel of Thomas,

996
00:37:41.177 --> 00:37:42.574
in fact, almost everything that you read

997
00:37:42.574 --> 00:37:46.562
how Jesus spoke in the Bible

998
00:37:46.562 --> 00:37:48.514
comes out of the Gospel of Thomas.

999
00:37:48.514 --> 00:37:50.203
'Cause that's how he spoke.

1000
00:37:51.213 --> 00:37:52.555
But in the Gospel of Thomas you'll find

1001
00:37:52.555 --> 00:37:55.435
more truth in that than you will

1002
00:37:55.435 --> 00:37:57.644
in modern day Bible.

1003
00:37:57.644 --> 00:37:58.432
Why?

1004
00:37:58.432 --> 00:38:00.747
Because it was never interpretted

1005
00:38:00.747 --> 00:38:02.379
the way that the Bible was.

1006
00:38:02.379 --> 00:38:03.980
In fact,

1007
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.113
coincidentally,

1008
00:38:06.113 --> 00:38:08.161
it was hidden in the Nag Hammadi Valley

1009
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:10.325
in Egypt until 1947 and somebody went,

1010
00:38:10.325 --> 00:38:11.335
hey , what's this?

1011
00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:13.835
After the Bible had been formed.

1012
00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:15.287
So fortunately, it got saved.

1013
00:38:15.287 --> 00:38:18.187
Same with the Dead Sea Scrolls, 1945.

1014
00:38:19.138 --> 00:38:21.207
But those books are literal.

1015
00:38:21.207 --> 00:38:22.551
But in the Gospel of Thomas, you have

1016
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:26.050
a literal interpretation of events and what happened.

1017
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.450
But you'll also find the Gospel of Philip,

1018
00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.393
the Gospel of James, Jesus' brother,

1019
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:33.527
they're all in the Nag Hammadi text.

1020
00:38:33.527 --> 00:38:34.881
And interestingly enough,

1021
00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:36.364
they don't dispute each other

1022
00:38:36.364 --> 00:38:38.336
like the biblical texts do.

1023
00:38:38.336 --> 00:38:40.774
They just don't support what the Bible says.

1024
00:38:42.337 --> 00:38:43.350
<v Regina>That's why those Bibles</v>

1025
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:44.512
are so skinny.

1026
00:38:44.512 --> 00:38:45.558
<v ->Yes, ma'am.</v>

1027
00:38:45.558 --> 00:38:46.561
<v Regina>And it's interesting,</v>

1028
00:38:46.561 --> 00:38:48.789
because you put a totally different

1029
00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:52.011
right-brain understanding to

1030
00:38:52.011 --> 00:38:54.752
all of the things we're taught, even in Sunday school,

1031
00:38:54.752 --> 00:38:55.637
for example.

1032
00:38:55.637 --> 00:38:58.517
All of the stories that have been used to keep us in line,

1033
00:38:59.499 --> 00:39:01.792
to help us to conform more,

1034
00:39:01.792 --> 00:39:03.168
to become good citizens.

1035
00:39:05.056 --> 00:39:07.124
<v ->It's actually designed to keep you away</v>

1036
00:39:07.124 --> 00:39:08.565
from your birthright.

1037
00:39:08.565 --> 00:39:09.535
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

1038
00:39:09.535 --> 00:39:10.837
That's a very good way to put it.

1039
00:39:10.837 --> 00:39:11.680
<v ->Yes, ma'am.</v>

1040
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.163
And it's no longer working.

1041
00:39:13.933 --> 00:39:15.051
Which is the truth.

1042
00:39:15.051 --> 00:39:16.215
<v Regina>So this is something,</v>

1043
00:39:16.215 --> 00:39:18.561
obviously a great value for people to dive into.

1044
00:39:18.561 --> 00:39:20.044
Especially if they've been indoctrinated

1045
00:39:20.044 --> 00:39:22.966
at any point in their life into the Christian church

1046
00:39:22.966 --> 00:39:24.492
and its modern definition,

1047
00:39:24.492 --> 00:39:26.978
and the enslavement that that brings with it.

1048
00:39:26.978 --> 00:39:28.162
And meanwhile, you haven't just,

1049
00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:30.114
it's not as though you've only studied

1050
00:39:30.114 --> 00:39:31.265
this particular lineage.

1051
00:39:31.265 --> 00:39:33.494
You have histories with a lot of people.

1052
00:39:33.494 --> 00:39:34.968
You have histories with the Cree,

1053
00:39:34.968 --> 00:39:35.799
with the Blackfoot,

1054
00:39:35.799 --> 00:39:37.197
with the Mayan.

1055
00:39:37.197 --> 00:39:38.935
And how does this,

1056
00:39:38.935 --> 00:39:41.954
well I would like to, even though we've already been there,

1057
00:39:41.954 --> 00:39:44.161
talking about Revelations a bit,

1058
00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:46.231
take all of this together,

1059
00:39:46.231 --> 00:39:47.478
all of their takes on it,

1060
00:39:47.478 --> 00:39:48.823
and the Hopi,

1061
00:39:48.823 --> 00:39:50.434
and bring this together

1062
00:39:50.434 --> 00:39:54.465
as what you're seeing as a unified understanding

1063
00:39:54.465 --> 00:39:55.680
of the time we're in.

1064
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.564
And the time we're bridging into.

1065
00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:01.526
(Steven sighs)

1066
00:40:01.526 --> 00:40:02.614
That's a big question.

1067
00:40:02.614 --> 00:40:05.473
<v ->Well, actually, it's a very intriguing one.</v>

1068
00:40:05.473 --> 00:40:07.471
So here we go.

1069
00:40:08.267 --> 00:40:10.027
We're born in this world to become masters

1070
00:40:10.027 --> 00:40:11.115
of our own ship.

1071
00:40:11.115 --> 00:40:12.278
We're all coming to,

1072
00:40:12.278 --> 00:40:14.070
the only reason we

1073
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.392
inhabit a body,

1074
00:40:16.277 --> 00:40:18.505
is so that we can

1075
00:40:18.505 --> 00:40:20.544
be god in the flesh.

1076
00:40:20.544 --> 00:40:22.357
And I believe all ancient texts,

1077
00:40:22.357 --> 00:40:25.333
and the reason we go through the cycles of 25,000 years,

1078
00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:27.626
and even when we look at the Hopi Prophecies

1079
00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:30.858
of the Legend of the Two Suns and the Blue Sun,

1080
00:40:30.858 --> 00:40:33.779
what they're talking about is a growth process

1081
00:40:33.779 --> 00:40:36.799
that each individual will do

1082
00:40:36.799 --> 00:40:39.252
throughout eternity until they become

1083
00:40:39.252 --> 00:40:40.916
like the Christ or like the Buddha.

1084
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:45.235
Until the become a living god in the flesh.

1085
00:40:45.235 --> 00:40:46.749
And when we look at all of those texts,

1086
00:40:46.749 --> 00:40:48.350
they share with us the journey

1087
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.227
and what's going to occur.

1088
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:53.074
We could literally say in the period we're in,

1089
00:40:53.074 --> 00:40:55.603
looking at it through the Mayan prism

1090
00:40:55.603 --> 00:40:59.667
of the idea of 2012 and literally say

1091
00:40:59.667 --> 00:41:01.311
this is graduation time.

1092
00:41:01.311 --> 00:41:03.700
Who has achieved, who has not?

1093
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.184
And Christians are gonna be really surprised

1094
00:41:06.184 --> 00:41:08.809
when they, after reading the Left Behind series,

1095
00:41:08.809 --> 00:41:10.744
at who's gonna be left behind.

1096
00:41:11.508 --> 00:41:13.517
But what does that in itself mean?

1097
00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:16.680
It's not like some are dumber than others.

1098
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.815
It just means some people break the bonds of birth and death

1099
00:41:19.815 --> 00:41:22.301
as all ancient text shares with us.

1100
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:25.831
It even says that in Mark 13 in the biblical text.

1101
00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:27.782
That once you attain that godhood,

1102
00:41:27.782 --> 00:41:30.545
then the idea of birth and death is no longer

1103
00:41:30.545 --> 00:41:32.379
a thing of relevance.

1104
00:41:32.379 --> 00:41:34.215
One of the things I love to share with people is

1105
00:41:34.215 --> 00:41:36.465
would you like to spend all eternity

1106
00:41:36.465 --> 00:41:38.491
in the skin that you have now?

1107
00:41:38.491 --> 00:41:40.412
If they say no, they have their answer.

1108
00:41:40.412 --> 00:41:42.993
If they say yes, they also have their answer.

1109
00:41:42.993 --> 00:41:46.524
And interestingly and intriguingly enough,

1110
00:41:46.524 --> 00:41:49.797
that's what all the traditions teach.

1111
00:41:49.797 --> 00:41:53.254
That we can overcome, not the body,

1112
00:41:53.254 --> 00:41:56.038
but we can overcome the pull of what

1113
00:41:56.038 --> 00:41:58.085
the body creates for us.

1114
00:41:58.085 --> 00:42:00.080
The body today is in dominance.

1115
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.595
What we're told all the texts is

1116
00:42:01.595 --> 00:42:04.613
there becomes a point where the soul is in dominance.

1117
00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:06.192
Now here's the intriguing part.

1118
00:42:06.192 --> 00:42:08.207
A soul always is in dominance,

1119
00:42:08.207 --> 00:42:10.757
it just allows us to think we are.

1120
00:42:10.757 --> 00:42:13.690
'Cause, you see, it's gonna live forever.

1121
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.471
<v Regina>Yes, we can have the illusion of separation</v>

1122
00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:16.591
as long as we wish.

1123
00:42:16.591 --> 00:42:18.051
<v ->As long as we choose.</v>

1124
00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:19.470
And interestingly enough also,

1125
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.956
medical science says the body regenerates itself

1126
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:23.161
every 18 months.

1127
00:42:23.161 --> 00:42:25.337
There's no reason for it to age.

1128
00:42:25.337 --> 00:42:27.364
Once we bring it all into unification

1129
00:42:27.364 --> 00:42:29.316
as all the texts tells us,

1130
00:42:29.316 --> 00:42:31.353
but making the journey is not an easy one

1131
00:42:31.353 --> 00:42:33.698
'cause there's many things that...

1132
00:42:33.698 --> 00:42:36.206
Myself, lived in a monastery.

1133
00:42:36.206 --> 00:42:37.069
No desire.

1134
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:38.712
Got into the world of desire.

1135
00:42:38.712 --> 00:42:40.643
Ended up overcoming that.

1136
00:42:40.643 --> 00:42:42.178
And because of that,

1137
00:42:42.178 --> 00:42:44.856
I attained a mastership over my own self,

1138
00:42:44.856 --> 00:42:47.779
because that's only as far as mastership can go.

1139
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:52.246
Once we achieve that, now our journey is free.

1140
00:42:52.246 --> 00:42:53.548
And it is about freedom,

1141
00:42:53.548 --> 00:42:56.312
it's about realizing completely who we are

1142
00:42:56.312 --> 00:42:57.848
and always have been.

1143
00:42:57.848 --> 00:43:00.216
As far as birth and death and my own sense goes?

1144
00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:01.613
We'll know when that time comes,

1145
00:43:01.613 --> 00:43:03.329
whenever that is if it ever is.

1146
00:43:03.329 --> 00:43:05.090
And that's the only way we'll ever know,

1147
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.743
but I can certainly assure you of this,

1148
00:43:06.743 --> 00:43:09.782
but for the most part, time is totally irrelevant to me.

1149
00:43:09.782 --> 00:43:12.225
So I know that unification is already there.

1150
00:43:12.225 --> 00:43:14.955
So if we look at the idea of the monastic teachings.

1151
00:43:14.955 --> 00:43:17.537
If we look at the Upanishads, the Vadas,

1152
00:43:17.537 --> 00:43:18.997
the Buddha Sutras.

1153
00:43:18.997 --> 00:43:21.089
If we look at the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi

1154
00:43:21.089 --> 00:43:24.129
and if we look at the Cree and Blackfoot and Maya

1155
00:43:24.129 --> 00:43:25.387
and Hopi traditions.

1156
00:43:25.387 --> 00:43:28.150
They're all pointing us at the same direction.

1157
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.285
There's a point in time that occurs every 25,000 years

1158
00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:33.883
where there's a real awakening for those that choose.

1159
00:43:34.752 --> 00:43:36.660
When you choose, you have a journey,

1160
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.464
and that's what Revelations in the Bible

1161
00:43:38.464 --> 00:43:39.744
actually relates to us.

1162
00:43:39.744 --> 00:43:41.812
Here's what's going to be your experience

1163
00:43:41.812 --> 00:43:44.928
as you release these charges from yourself.

1164
00:43:44.928 --> 00:43:47.732
And when you release these charges from yourself,

1165
00:43:47.732 --> 00:43:49.801
then you have the culmination of the legend

1166
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:51.178
of the Hopi Blue Sun.

1167
00:43:51.178 --> 00:43:54.462
Tthat's the full healing of every aspect of self.

1168
00:43:54.462 --> 00:43:56.499
When we look at the idea of the pole shifts

1169
00:43:56.499 --> 00:43:57.896
offered by prophets.

1170
00:43:57.896 --> 00:43:59.965
Sure it affects the Earth, but more importantly

1171
00:43:59.965 --> 00:44:01.108
it affects the human.

1172
00:44:01.108 --> 00:44:02.984
And I believe all those texts share with us

1173
00:44:02.984 --> 00:44:04.445
the same idea.

1174
00:44:04.445 --> 00:44:06.932
So in a world that we're looking at today,

1175
00:44:06.932 --> 00:44:09.277
you may see conflict.

1176
00:44:09.277 --> 00:44:11.369
You may see global war.

1177
00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:12.967
But with these I see

1178
00:44:12.967 --> 00:44:15.154
is the birthing of a new human

1179
00:44:15.154 --> 00:44:17.170
coming into existence.

1180
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.538
And that's what all texts tells us.

1181
00:44:19.538 --> 00:44:21.528
That's my understanding.

1182
00:44:22.675 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Regina>And who are we?</v>

1183
00:44:25.065 --> 00:44:27.091
<v ->God. We're all divine.</v>

1184
00:44:27.091 --> 00:44:30.334
We're awakening to that higher nature.

1185
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.595
It doesn't mean we forgo the body.

1186
00:44:32.595 --> 00:44:35.635
It means we live it in our reality through the body.

1187
00:44:35.635 --> 00:44:37.469
That's who we are.

1188
00:44:37.469 --> 00:44:39.208
We're time immemorial.

1189
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:40.531
We've been on every planet

1190
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:42.183
and every star system that anybody

1191
00:44:42.183 --> 00:44:44.241
could ever conceive of.

1192
00:44:44.241 --> 00:44:46.802
We're just another seed that's awakening

1193
00:44:46.802 --> 00:44:48.775
to that higher nature,

1194
00:44:48.775 --> 00:44:52.306
so that we ourselves can travel beyond here

1195
00:44:52.306 --> 00:44:54.279
through all eternity once more.

1196
00:44:54.279 --> 00:44:55.388
<v Regina>And you're not saying this as a</v>

1197
00:44:55.388 --> 00:44:59.089
result of a one, single insight into meditation,

1198
00:44:59.089 --> 00:45:01.478
but as a body of understanding

1199
00:45:01.478 --> 00:45:04.113
after 37 years, as you say, of turning over

1200
00:45:04.113 --> 00:45:07.658
every stone and leaf and your own insights.

1201
00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:10.641
<v ->One of the fascinating things to me</v>

1202
00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:13.606
is when you do that and you study prophecy

1203
00:45:13.606 --> 00:45:14.982
for all of that period of time

1204
00:45:14.982 --> 00:45:17.488
and you've studied from different parts of the world.

1205
00:45:18.399 --> 00:45:20.555
There can be no coincidence that the Hopi, the Cree,

1206
00:45:20.555 --> 00:45:22.837
the Blackfoot, the Maya, the Middle Eastern text,

1207
00:45:22.837 --> 00:45:25.243
Far Eastern text all say the same thing.

1208
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.302
And they're leading us to one point.

1209
00:45:29.172 --> 00:45:34.143
And that point, we all that can hear or see this, today,

1210
00:45:34.143 --> 00:45:37.141
have the honor and privilege of seeing where we stand

1211
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:39.337
in the spectrum of time.

1212
00:45:39.337 --> 00:45:41.780
Are you, or are you not,

1213
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.842
living through your own divine nature?

1214
00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:47.124
If you are, bless you.

1215
00:45:47.124 --> 00:45:48.904
If not, bless you.

1216
00:45:48.904 --> 00:45:52.173
Your journey's just a little longer, that's all.

1217
00:45:54.526 --> 00:45:55.529
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1218
00:45:55.529 --> 00:45:56.771
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

1219
00:45:57.875 --> 00:46:00.307
<v ->To delve much deeper into Dr. Hairfield's work,</v>

1220
00:46:00.307 --> 00:46:02.078
you can purchase a copy of his work,

1221
00:46:02.078 --> 00:46:04.627
A Metaphysical Interpretation of the Bible.

1222
00:46:04.627 --> 00:46:07.324
In addition, he conducts tours to India each year

1223
00:46:07.324 --> 00:46:09.992
for those who wish to have a personal experience.

1224
00:46:09.992 --> 00:46:12.168
I find him to have an unusually broad

1225
00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:14.728
and accurate grasp on the human condition.

1226
00:46:14.728 --> 00:46:16.232
Until next time, thanks for watching

1227
00:46:16.232 --> 00:46:17.879
Conscious Media Network.

1228
00:46:19.186 --> 00:46:24.186
