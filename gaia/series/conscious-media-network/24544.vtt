00:00:01.186 --> 00:00:03.988
<v ->By now many if not most of you have heard of the book</v>

2
00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:06.724
and now the film "The Way of the Peaceful Warrior".

3
00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:09.293
It's a somewhat fictionalized portrayal of the journey

4
00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:12.330
of a young man from his material success in life

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.565
turn to tragedy and then his rebirth

6
00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:16.267
into a wiser way of living

7
00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:18.403
learned from a mystical old man.

8
00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:21.028
This was in fact the personal of odyssey of Dan Millman.

9
00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:23.074
Since then he has written more than a dozen books

10
00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.176
based on the principles of his teacher

11
00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.245
known to him as Socrates.

12
00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:29.514
We met with Dan and talked about everything from the path

13
00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:31.482
to becoming a peaceful warrior

14
00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.318
to the beauty of the small moment

15
00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:34.982
as taught to him by Socrates

16
00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:37.705
while he was practicing for a gymnastic competition.

17
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.768
I think the big question for myself and a lot of viewers

18
00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:52.637
having read your book many years ago, the original book,

19
00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:56.241
is where was this weaving the truth in

20
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:57.542
who is Socrates

21
00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:01.495
and where was artistic license taken?

22
00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.749
Just in the points that you would find

23
00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.700
to be particularly relevant?

24
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.052
And I'll just let you go on that one

25
00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:09.704
because I know you've heard these questions many times.

26
00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:11.356
<v ->Well, it's never quite the same,</v>

27
00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.424
and every answer is slightly different too

28
00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:17.228
in the sense that there is a very long story

29
00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:20.098
about how the book developed into a movie,

30
00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:21.499
adapting a book to film

31
00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.668
is like turning painting into a sculpture,

32
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.337
changes have to be made.

33
00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:28.839
So people would ask me over time, you know,

34
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:31.142
was there really a Socrates, the old man you met

35
00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:34.061
at the gas station, played by Nick Nolte in the film,

36
00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:37.148
and how much of the book was true.

37
00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:38.617
So let's deal with that first, just the book.

38
00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:39.552
<v Voiceover>That's what I would prefer to deal with, yes.</v>

39
00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:40.803
<v ->Sure.</v>

40
00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:44.622
Well, the book is a blend of fact and fiction,

41
00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:45.991
that's the simplest way to put it.

42
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.259
Socrates was absolutely real,

43
00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.294
Dan Millman, however, is a fictional character.

44
00:01:50.294 --> 00:01:51.896
(both laugh)

45
00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:54.331
No, I really did meet an old man about three in the morning

46
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.669
in a gas station, and he didn't jump up on a roof top

47
00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:59.170
that wasn't really what kept me there,

48
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.873
it was a good literary device to get my attention,

49
00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:03.841
to get my readers' attention.

50
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.675
But actually it was more like a wander in the forest

51
00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:10.141
in India centuries ago came upon the Buddha.

52
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.983
And he didn't know who was

53
00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.218
but the wanderer was fascinated by this personage

54
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:16.554
and he kept following him, and finally got the nerve

55
00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:18.556
to walk up and approach him, and he said,

56
00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.258
to the Buddha and he said, "Are you a wizard?"

57
00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:22.760
And the Buddha said, "No."

58
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.597
And he said, "Well, are you a king or a warrior?"

59
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:27.031
And the Buddha said, "No."

60
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.733
And he said, "Well, what is it that makes you different

61
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.968
"from anyone I've ever met?"

62
00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.521
And the Buddha smiled and said, "Oh, I am awake."

63
00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:35.940
And that's what struck me about this old guy,

64
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.942
there was something about him, a twinkle in the eye,

65
00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:40.011
the way he carried himself, the way he breathed.

66
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:43.715
He had something that I wanted that I didn't have

67
00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:46.483
and I didn't know what it was, I couldn't articulate it,

68
00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:47.986
like so many of us.

69
00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:49.454
There's something we're looking for

70
00:02:49.454 --> 00:02:51.589
more that news, weather and sports,

71
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:52.891
but we can't articulate it.

72
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:54.960
A bigger picture of life, the transcendant

73
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.661
is what the yearning is for,

74
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.229
but how many people would articulate that

75
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.830
before they discover it.

76
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.134
So he kept me around the gas station,

77
00:03:02.134 --> 00:03:04.836
and so I did meet a real old man,

78
00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:07.838
I did shatter my leg in a motorcycle accident,

79
00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:10.974
much of the story, the structure of it is autobiographical.

80
00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:13.578
But I wove in with elements of imagination,

81
00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:15.513
the journey, the inner journeys and so on,

82
00:03:15.513 --> 00:03:17.915
to convey some remiders for living

83
00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:20.934
we all know deeper levels but we tend to forget.

84
00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:23.688
<v Voiceover>And did your relationship then continue</v>

85
00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:26.424
with this man that you met?

86
00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:29.227
<v ->Our relationship with Socrates was not as long</v>

87
00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:31.129
as it indicated in the book.

88
00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.299
From the time I met him in 1966, winter of 1966,

89
00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.136
to the time I wrote the book 14 years passed,

90
00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.407
and so during that time I met other mentors,

91
00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:45.110
I traveled around the world, had other experiences,

92
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.648
so I conveyed he was a voice for all that I learned in my life

93
00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:50.698
to that time

94
00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:51.917
but he was a cosmical guy, he wasn't just based

95
00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:54.018
on an old mechanic.

96
00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:56.787
When I met him he really had something.

97
00:03:56.787 --> 00:04:00.892
<v Voiceover>So in your real life what was it</v>

98
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:02.761
that he was able to impart with you,

99
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:04.728
your first infusion from,

100
00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.931
Well, first of all, the character in the book,

101
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:10.902
the character in the movie was a rather cocky young man

102
00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:13.171
who had the world in the palm of his hands,

103
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.807
who was going to the Nationals, Internationals

104
00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:18.209
and really had it made okay.

105
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.379
So from that position as a young man

106
00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.414
what was it he infused into you

107
00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:26.084
however brief the time was together

108
00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:27.969
that really started the journey?

109
00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.022
<v ->Well, I can answer that in two separate parts.</v>

110
00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:34.258
The first part is yes, I was indeed successful

111
00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:36.694
in the context of a college career:

112
00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:40.264
top athlete, had a girlfriend, grades were good.

113
00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:43.668
So life was good, and yet despite that

114
00:04:43.668 --> 00:04:46.471
something felt missing, and I think that's why so many people

115
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.539
related to the story

116
00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.075
because some people who are successful in business,

117
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:52.978
relationships and many other areas of life,

118
00:04:52.978 --> 00:04:55.379
they had money, whatever, and they go,

119
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.182
they still feel that yearning, that missing piece.

120
00:04:58.182 --> 00:04:59.284
<v Voiveover>Is that all there is?</v>

121
00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:00.318
<v ->Is that all there is.</v>

122
00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:00.852
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

123
00:05:00.852 --> 00:05:03.355
<v ->And so I think that opened me up.</v>

124
00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:06.457
When I met this old guy, because I'd passed that station

125
00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.160
hundreds of times and so many people had,

126
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.862
and all they saw was this old guy,

127
00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:12.830
thanks for the gas, and left.

128
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.232
But at that moment I was open to something.

129
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.701
and there's a saying in the spiritual traditions

130
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:19.870
that even a glimpse at a spiritual master,

131
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.774
I'm not saying Socrates was a spiritual master,

132
00:05:22.774 --> 00:05:26.645
but even a glimpse one can carry the rest of one's life

133
00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:28.012
because things are communicated

134
00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:30.664
at a subconscious level, body to body,

135
00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:33.318
spirit to spirit.

136
00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:36.287
That even though you may have a brief contact

137
00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:37.555
certain things are communicated,

138
00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.792
it's like they quicken seeds inside of us

139
00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.860
and they sprout in their own time.

140
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.362
So that's, I know it sounds a bit cosmic but that's,

141
00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:47.598
I can't give you anything more concrete

142
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:50.202
other than conveyed in the book in the conversations

143
00:05:50.202 --> 00:05:52.316
where he would poke fun at me

144
00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:53.771
he had to shake me up a little bit.

145
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.939
<v Voiceover>Did he do that for real?</v>

146
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.474
<v ->Yeah, yeah, that first night even.</v>

147
00:05:58.142 --> 00:06:01.479
You know, he just didn't act like anybody I'd known,

148
00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.282
and so that I was looking for unconventional people,

149
00:06:04.282 --> 00:06:06.400
I've always gravitated towards the weirdos of the world

150
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.152
because I felt like one myself.

151
00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:12.423
even though I look very conventional, still do and did then.

152
00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:16.777
I'm pretty wild inside, not a conventional mind,

153
00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:19.563
and in my new book "Wisdom of the Peaceful Warrior"

154
00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:22.399
I wrote after 25 years after "Way of the Peaceful Warrior"

155
00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.003
to really clarify the lessons in that first book

156
00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:27.739
from a viewpoint of some evolution and maturation

157
00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:29.006
25 years later.

158
00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:29.640
<v Voiceover>so important.</v>

159
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.510
<v ->So I do cover that arena as well</v>

160
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.611
and other questions like that

161
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:37.181
but that's why he impressed me.

162
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:39.284
<v Voiceover>And you wrote a book following that</v>

163
00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:41.586
some time later, we have right in front of this,

164
00:06:41.586 --> 00:06:42.820
The Journey of Socrates.

165
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.654
<v ->Yes.</v>

166
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:46.958
<v Voiceover>And this is maybe loosely, or not so loosely,</v>

167
00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.294
based on his life as you came to know him?

168
00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:53.397
<v ->Well, it was generated by questions over the years</v>

169
00:06:53.397 --> 00:06:55.966
about, "Dan, you never mentioned in your book,

170
00:06:55.966 --> 00:06:58.069
"in your first book, in "Way of the Peaceful Warrior"

171
00:06:58.069 --> 00:06:59.805
"about this old guy, was he married?

172
00:06:59.805 --> 00:07:01.305
"Did he have kids?

173
00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:02.373
"Who were his teachers?

174
00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:05.676
"How did he become this cosmic, powerful, enigmatical man?"

175
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:09.079
And I didn't really have all the details

176
00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.914
so it does say "fiction" on the back

177
00:07:10.914 --> 00:07:12.683
of the Journeys of Socrates

178
00:07:12.683 --> 00:07:14.284
which I gave by the way in manuscript form

179
00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:16.287
to Nick Nolte before he played the role

180
00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:18.190
so he could have a sense of back story.

181
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.326
the depth, the pains he'd gone through

182
00:07:21.326 --> 00:07:22.626
in growing up in his ordeal,

183
00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:23.862
his Odyssey.

184
00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:27.131
Nick said it was really helpful for playing that role.

185
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:31.535
So I wrote the book to explain,

186
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:32.736
to tell his story,

187
00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:35.474
a very different life than mine, you know, middle class,

188
00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:38.042
upbringing, relatively easy life.

189
00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:40.478
We all have traumas, emotionally we've all had physical,

190
00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:42.413
emotional and mental pain in our life,

191
00:07:42.413 --> 00:07:44.582
we've all grown wiser and stronger and more compassionate

192
00:07:44.582 --> 00:07:45.716
because of it.

193
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:48.818
That's why I say we're all peaceful warriors in training.

194
00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:52.396
But his life was extraordinary in its difficulty,

195
00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:53.891
in its adversity.

196
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:57.979
He grew up Russia, born 1872, his name was Sergey Ivanov,

197
00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:01.132
and the story tells how a boy became a man,

198
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:03.201
why a man became a warrior,

199
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.470
but also how warrior found peace

200
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.271
which is I think the most important part of the book

201
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.108
because it explains how to finally break those cycles

202
00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:13.377
of retribution and revenge, even when one is justified

203
00:08:13.377 --> 00:08:15.713
in taking revenge to stop the tribalism

204
00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:17.114
we have in the world today

205
00:08:17.114 --> 00:08:18.850
one group fighting another group,

206
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.652
and as soon as one person is killed on one side

207
00:08:20.652 --> 00:08:23.054
two get killed on the other side in revenge.

208
00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:26.223
And so the book has a larger theme

209
00:08:26.223 --> 00:08:28.192
in terms of how we can break that

210
00:08:28.192 --> 00:08:30.378
and finally say "Enough".

211
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:33.296
<v Voiceover>I was going to say the same thing</v>

212
00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:36.068
you just said it so relevant at this very moment in time.

213
00:08:36.068 --> 00:08:38.535
It's always relevant but it seems as though we're

214
00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:40.872
on the brink of something and that story

215
00:08:40.872 --> 00:08:43.207
is particularly relevant right now.

216
00:08:43.207 --> 00:08:46.878
<v ->Yeah, and it will be, I mean, I,</v>

217
00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:48.979
my goal, subconscious goal really,

218
00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:51.915
I never strategically set out to write the books I did.

219
00:08:51.915 --> 00:08:54.685
If I had, if I wanted to be a successful author,

220
00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.088
I would have found some good characters

221
00:08:57.088 --> 00:08:58.723
and done mystery novels.

222
00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:01.059
Everyone would be like the last yet different,

223
00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:03.394
and the readers who read one would read the next

224
00:09:03.394 --> 00:09:07.931
and the next, but every one of my books suprised me.

225
00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:10.235
It made no sense, the first one I wrote, Peaceful Warrior,

226
00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:12.370
10 years later, I didn't write a book for 10 years,

227
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.171
because I had nothing new to say,

228
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:15.440
which I think is rather refreshing.

229
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

230
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.843
<v ->And then 10 years later, a new mentor, new teacher,</v>

231
00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:21.213
new influence in my life and I had all this information

232
00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:22.380
pouring in.

233
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.416
So I wrote Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior.

234
00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:26.850
Which wasn't a sequel, it doesn't start after,

235
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.052
it takes place within the original story.

236
00:09:29.052 --> 00:09:29.686
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

237
00:09:29.686 --> 00:09:31.823
<v ->And then 20 years later I wrote Journeys of Socrates</v>

238
00:09:31.823 --> 00:09:34.993
which is the prequal, takes place many many years

239
00:09:34.993 --> 00:09:37.895
before the story and explains about my mentor.

240
00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:40.731
And meanwhile, I wrote books with many titles,

241
00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:43.534
A Life You Were Born To Live, No Ordinary Moments,

242
00:09:43.534 --> 00:09:45.936
The Laws of Spirit, each one very different

243
00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:48.873
from the other books because it's another piece

244
00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:51.309
of the puzzle, another part of the map.

245
00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:53.078
So I don't write books just to write a book,

246
00:09:53.078 --> 00:09:55.113
or just to clone the book I did before.

247
00:09:55.113 --> 00:09:56.080
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

248
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.849
Just really briefly, going back to when you started

249
00:09:58.849 --> 00:09:59.817
this whole journey--

250
00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:00.485
<v ->Mhm.</v>

251
00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:02.452
<v Voiceover>As you said, you were rather brash</v>

252
00:10:02.452 --> 00:10:04.354
and successful and you had your view of the world

253
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.590
as a young man has--

254
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.524
<v ->Sure.</v>

255
00:10:06.524 --> 00:10:07.691
<v Voiceover>Looking back on that,</v>

256
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:10.227
or even at the time when you started really undertsanding

257
00:10:10.227 --> 00:10:13.864
who this other man was, what his journey had been,

258
00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:16.333
did it make you almost cringe to think

259
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:18.570
of how you had been earlier, even though of course

260
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.339
we are all what we are until we have an influence to change.

261
00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:22.640
<v ->Oh absolutely, Regina.</v>

262
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.478
When I write a draft of a book, my first draft,

263
00:10:27.645 --> 00:10:30.982
Ernest Hemingway said the first draft of anything is crap.

264
00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:34.484
And when I write a draft, there's that creative process,

265
00:10:34.484 --> 00:10:35.986
you fall in love with your own words,

266
00:10:35.986 --> 00:10:37.656
you love the creativity that's coming out,

267
00:10:37.656 --> 00:10:39.491
characters appearing and whatever.

268
00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:41.860
But if you're a good writer, if you're fortunate,

269
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.028
you put it aside for a while and when you look at it again,

270
00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:47.030
you go oh my god, that's awful,

271
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.999
and that's good.

272
00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:51.602
Because you made a jump of awareness

273
00:10:51.602 --> 00:10:52.770
and you can begin to rewrite.

274
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.306
That's what I love doing is rewriting and improving.

275
00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:57.408
And the third draft is better, and the fourth draft

276
00:10:57.408 --> 00:10:58.976
is better and polished.

277
00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:01.212
So it's the same way looking back on our lives,

278
00:11:01.212 --> 00:11:03.181
of course if we look back on our teenage years

279
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:06.118
how kind we were and respectful to our parents,

280
00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:08.152
bit of irony there,

281
00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:10.622
we can look back and go oh, what was I thinking.

282
00:11:10.622 --> 00:11:12.089
<v Voiceover>How little we knew.</v>

283
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:14.425
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

284
00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:16.460
And maybe there are people who say,

285
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.295
no it was all fine, they're either enlightened

286
00:11:18.295 --> 00:11:19.996
or unconscious.

287
00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:22.766
So of course we look back on our lives

288
00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:25.435
and mistakes and I couldn't count the number

289
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.506
of mistakes I've made but because I was a gymnast,

290
00:11:28.506 --> 00:11:30.141
all I did was made mistakes until I learned

291
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:31.443
what I was going to learn.

292
00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:33.377
So it was a natural process for me,

293
00:11:33.377 --> 00:11:35.913
of making errors, learning from them and moving on.

294
00:11:35.913 --> 00:11:36.647
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

295
00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:38.248
And you were so lucky to have this guide.

296
00:11:38.248 --> 00:11:41.219
And what's wonderful is that you've shared your journey,

297
00:11:41.219 --> 00:11:43.386
obviously though all of these various books

298
00:11:43.386 --> 00:11:47.091
and one that I picked up recently, because I wanted to look

299
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:52.563
at your take on a scientific, hands-on version,

300
00:11:52.563 --> 00:11:55.099
since we don't all have a Socrates appearing

301
00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:57.168
in the middle of the night at a gas station,

302
00:11:57.168 --> 00:12:00.905
nor an extraordinary life where these incredible events

303
00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:04.157
occurred and you overcame these incredible obstacles,

304
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:09.212
yourself, physically and finding your way on your path.

305
00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:12.283
We don't all have that, so we all need guidence

306
00:12:12.283 --> 00:12:14.952
and even if we only need a reminder, we still need guidence

307
00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:18.489
but many of us need flat out, how do we start from A

308
00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:19.723
and figure ourselves out--

309
00:12:19.723 --> 00:12:21.225
<v ->Sure, where do we start from here?</v>

310
00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:22.659
<v Voiceover>Where do we start from here?</v>

311
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:26.264
And it seems like you've... first you tell me

312
00:12:26.264 --> 00:12:27.699
before I ask you about this one book,

313
00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:29.467
which of the books that you've written

314
00:12:29.467 --> 00:12:32.036
do you feel is the wonderful, lets start here.

315
00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:35.639
<v ->Most people read Way of the Peaceful Warrior first</v>

316
00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:37.774
because it's an introduction to my work.

317
00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:39.977
And it's the one that people get inspired by

318
00:12:39.977 --> 00:12:42.313
and get that feeling, a flavor,

319
00:12:42.313 --> 00:12:43.947
for the Peaceful Warrior's way.

320
00:12:43.947 --> 00:12:45.482
But to really understand what does it mean

321
00:12:45.482 --> 00:12:47.250
to live as a Peaceful Warrior, what is that term,

322
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.785
how can you be peaceful and a warrior,

323
00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:51.021
all those question, I explain,

324
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.858
well after Sacred Journey, people started saying,

325
00:12:53.858 --> 00:12:55.760
well I was inspired by your first two books Dan,

326
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.028
but how do you apply this stuff to daily life?

327
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.630
So I wrote No Ordinary Moments,

328
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.432
a Peaceful Warrior's guide to daily life.

329
00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:04.368
And then I explained the three selves, how that works,

330
00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:06.404
how we're made up of these three,

331
00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:09.206
it's a model of reality to understand ourselves

332
00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:12.309
and went into more explanation of what a Peaceful Warrior is

333
00:13:12.309 --> 00:13:14.378
which I might as well share now,

334
00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:16.381
for those who aren't familiar with my work.

335
00:13:16.381 --> 00:13:18.182
The best way I can put it is,

336
00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:20.484
all of us are Peaceful Warriors in training.

337
00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:22.687
Because planet Earth is not necessarily

338
00:13:22.687 --> 00:13:24.088
the easiest realm.

339
00:13:24.088 --> 00:13:26.390
We have gravity, friction and death here.

340
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.859
We lose all we love eventually.

341
00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:31.561
Every one of us have had pain in our lives

342
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.263
and we've grown for it.

343
00:13:33.263 --> 00:13:35.266
Every adversity has a hidden gift.

344
00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:37.301
In fact the adversities of our lives I see

345
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.836
as a form of spiritual weight lifting,

346
00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:40.170
to strengthen our spirits.

347
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.638
We don't have to pretend to like it,

348
00:13:41.638 --> 00:13:43.440
but when it happens, it's good to have that thread

349
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.409
of understanding.

350
00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:49.080
So all of us are Peaceful Warriors striving to live

351
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.649
with a peaceful heart but a warrior spirit.

352
00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:53.717
Because it takes courage to live in this world,

353
00:13:53.717 --> 00:13:55.886
it takes courage to love in this world,

354
00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:58.422
because when you love someone, when you have children,

355
00:13:58.422 --> 00:14:00.157
your nerve endings are out there

356
00:14:00.157 --> 00:14:01.392
and you're gonna suffer loss.

357
00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:03.760
Every time they skin their knee, for children.

358
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.697
Or if a loved one dies or has a difficulty.

359
00:14:06.697 --> 00:14:08.732
So it takes courage to do that,

360
00:14:08.732 --> 00:14:11.001
and those who don't want to suffer any of that

361
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:13.071
they can just live alone in a little trailer somewhere

362
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:14.171
and never have to go through that

363
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:16.222
but they miss an aspect of life.

364
00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:17.541
Now I'm not saying everyone should have children

365
00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:19.243
or everyone should get married.

366
00:14:19.243 --> 00:14:21.712
But everything we do in life takes courage

367
00:14:21.712 --> 00:14:23.380
and if we look at our lives, many of us say

368
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.616
oh I lived a middle class life, my life's been easy,

369
00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:27.785
it's not like Dan I didn't shatter my leg

370
00:14:27.785 --> 00:14:30.688
or Socrates, I won't even go into what he had to deal

371
00:14:30.688 --> 00:14:32.489
with in his life
<v Voiceover>Well we'll find out</v>

372
00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:34.725
in a little bit, yes.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

373
00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:37.327
But still, all of us, if we can appreciate

374
00:14:37.327 --> 00:14:39.363
what we've gone through, the emotional pain

375
00:14:39.363 --> 00:14:40.797
the mental pain.

376
00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.967
You know Mark Twain once said, I've had many troubles

377
00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:44.969
in my life, most of which never happened.

378
00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:46.337
<v Vocieover>Right, I love that quote.</v>

379
00:14:46.337 --> 00:14:48.739
<v ->Yeah because most of it's in the past and future</v>

380
00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:50.907
and our imagination and our memory.

381
00:14:50.907 --> 00:14:52.843
But in the present moment, we can deal

382
00:14:52.843 --> 00:14:54.478
with the present moment.

383
00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:58.048
So every one of us is a Peaceful Warrior in training.

384
00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:00.752
And I'll go into that more later when I talk

385
00:15:00.752 --> 00:15:02.453
about A Warrior's Spirit.

386
00:15:02.453 --> 00:15:04.955
<v Voiceover>Okay, and also, the whole notion</v>

387
00:15:04.955 --> 00:15:06.656
of the small moments.

388
00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.792
Off camera before we began the interview,

389
00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:12.462
I was talking about so many years ago having read

390
00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:15.766
the first book, I remember this one little scene

391
00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:18.302
about a simple little meal preparation,

392
00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:20.905
the way the vegetables were perfectly sliced

393
00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:24.241
and perfectly presented and that stuck with me,

394
00:15:24.241 --> 00:15:26.676
is the artistry of the small moment.

395
00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:30.313
Where does the beauty in each small moment

396
00:15:30.313 --> 00:15:33.433
feed into, The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.

397
00:15:33.818 --> 00:15:36.020
<v ->Well the book and the movie made much</v>

398
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.388
about living in the present moment.

399
00:15:37.388 --> 00:15:40.924
Though many people aren't terribly clear on how to do that.

400
00:15:40.924 --> 00:15:43.693
In my longer seminars, we go into how to do that

401
00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.262
because there's time to develop that

402
00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.965
but simply put, let me just tell you a story

403
00:15:47.965 --> 00:15:51.068
because all we have is a little moment,

404
00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:54.037
this one and the next one, life is a series of moments.

405
00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.373
And I often say, I've never met an intelligent person,

406
00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:59.042
I've only met people who have more intelligent moments.

407
00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:01.211
There are moments of enlightenment,

408
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.481
moments of callousness, moments of ignorance,

409
00:16:03.481 --> 00:16:05.248
moments of awakeness,

410
00:16:05.248 --> 00:16:09.085
and what we can do as individuals is to number

411
00:16:09.085 --> 00:16:11.255
those moments in our lives through practice.

412
00:16:11.255 --> 00:16:15.259
And speaking of practice, I was in the gymnasium one night,

413
00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:17.794
and Socrates came in and was watching me

414
00:16:17.794 --> 00:16:21.064
and I did some big dismount off the high bar,

415
00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.666
full twisting double summersalt, whatever,

416
00:16:22.666 --> 00:16:24.768
but I stuck my landing, which is a good thing

417
00:16:24.768 --> 00:16:25.602
in gymnastics.

418
00:16:25.602 --> 00:16:27.651
And I went yes!

419
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.742
Then the workout was over, so I ripped off my sweatshirt

420
00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:33.943
and threw it in my bag and we were waling down the hallway

421
00:16:33.943 --> 00:16:36.580
afterwards and he said you know Dan,

422
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.349
that last move you did was really sloppy.

423
00:16:39.349 --> 00:16:40.918
And I went, I don't get it,

424
00:16:40.918 --> 00:16:43.453
like so many of the things he said, I didn't get it.

425
00:16:43.453 --> 00:16:45.088
It just stopped my mind and he said

426
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.491
oh I'm not talking about the dismount you did,

427
00:16:47.491 --> 00:16:49.960
I'm talking about the way you ripped off your sweatshirt

428
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.562
and threw it in your bag.

429
00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:54.765
And his point was that I was treating one moment as special

430
00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:56.733
going around the horizontal bar,

431
00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:57.934
I was treating another moment

432
00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:01.071
as ordinary, taking off my sweatshirt.

433
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:03.374
And that's when he said, and I got this line into the movie

434
00:17:03.374 --> 00:17:04.908
at the last minute, that's when he said Dan,

435
00:17:04.908 --> 00:17:07.611
the difference between us is you practice gymnastics

436
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:09.846
I practice everything.

437
00:17:09.846 --> 00:17:12.615
And there's a difference between doing something

438
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.484
and practicing something.

439
00:17:14.484 --> 00:17:16.886
Most of us are doing things all day.

440
00:17:16.886 --> 00:17:19.323
But the moment we change that, to rather than just

441
00:17:19.323 --> 00:17:21.692
doing it, just doing the dishes,

442
00:17:21.692 --> 00:17:23.660
instead of practicing doing the dishes.

443
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.830
Practice is doing something consciously to improve,

444
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.066
each time you do it, over time, to improve.

445
00:17:29.066 --> 00:17:31.634
Breathing, refinement of movement,

446
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.637
improve the quality,

447
00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:38.075
and to me if there's one essential practice

448
00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:41.411
of a Peaceful Warrior, it's practicing each moment.

449
00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:43.246
Every time we sign our name, to see if we can do it

450
00:17:43.246 --> 00:17:45.348
a little more smoothly and gracefully.

451
00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:47.851
Every time we walk into the supermarket,

452
00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:50.088
pick up something, see if we can do it more gracefully.

453
00:17:50.088 --> 00:17:52.556
Like doing Tai Chi all through life.

454
00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:55.459
And that practice changes the quality of the moment,

455
00:17:55.459 --> 00:17:58.529
it immerses us, it brings us back to the present.

456
00:17:58.529 --> 00:17:59.396
So...

457
00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:01.464
<v Voiceover>And just being mindful in the moment,</v>

458
00:18:01.464 --> 00:18:04.168
actually even in the film, I thought it was done quite well.

459
00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:05.202
<v ->Mhm.</v>

460
00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:09.706
<v Voiceover>When you had to utilize that</v>

461
00:18:09.706 --> 00:18:12.075
in your practice on the rings, right?

462
00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:13.943
Oh no it was on the vault--

463
00:18:13.943 --> 00:18:15.578
<v ->On the pommel horse.
<v Voiceover>On the pommel horse.</v>

464
00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:18.581
I thought that was absolutely beautiful.

465
00:18:20.741 --> 00:18:23.486
In the film, the expression of all those around you,

466
00:18:23.486 --> 00:18:26.807
and how it inspired them not knowing why,

467
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:32.662
and so have you been able to in essence,

468
00:18:32.662 --> 00:18:36.299
make your life a practice as Socrates did?

469
00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:38.134
<v ->Yes. Absolutely.</v>

470
00:18:38.134 --> 00:18:39.603
Now, do I forget a lot?

471
00:18:39.603 --> 00:18:40.938
Yes, I do.

472
00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:42.573
People have asked me Dan, you wrote a book called

473
00:18:42.573 --> 00:18:43.607
Everyday Enlightenment,

474
00:18:43.607 --> 00:18:45.175
the Twelve Gateways to Personal Growth,

475
00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:47.611
have you mastered all those gateways yourself?

476
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:49.212
And the answer is no,

477
00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:52.115
but I'm sincerely practicing in all those areas.

478
00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:54.417
If I weren't, I'd have no business writing about it.

479
00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:57.221
And if someone watched me, it might be a little boring

480
00:18:57.221 --> 00:18:59.857
watching me morning til night, they'd probably see

481
00:18:59.857 --> 00:19:02.726
I'm not a perfect example, but I think a good example

482
00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.394
of all that I teach.

483
00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:08.164
And so it gets better over time, like any practice.

484
00:19:08.164 --> 00:19:09.666
<v Voiceover>There is a,</v>

485
00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:11.701
excuse me, I have a little frog in my throat,

486
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:15.171
there is a really gentle,

487
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:17.106
loving focus you feel

488
00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:18.942
in your presence.

489
00:19:20.543 --> 00:19:22.278
I think it really exemplifies all the practice

490
00:19:22.278 --> 00:19:24.014
you've done throughout your life.

491
00:19:24.014 --> 00:19:26.649
You walk very softly, you're very clear,

492
00:19:26.649 --> 00:19:30.087
you're very considerate, you hear other people out,

493
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:33.323
whether we're saying something, particularly intriguing

494
00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:37.460
or not but I really feel that sense of attention

495
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.763
to the moment that awareness that you've developed,

496
00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.098
I just wanted to say that on camera, it's very evident,

497
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.300
being around you that you've developed this.

498
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.770
<v ->And I have to say in my sense of authenticity,</v>

499
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.039
anyone can do it for a camera interview

500
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.141
or for a few minutes if you have guests over.

501
00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:54.778
And yes more of the time I do live this way,

502
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.247
from practice, but I forget to.

503
00:19:57.247 --> 00:19:59.282
So people need to be gentle with themselves.

504
00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.618
So many people beat themselves up because

505
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.588
they measure themselves against some idealized image.

506
00:20:05.468 --> 00:20:07.325
There's so many idealized notions

507
00:20:07.325 --> 00:20:09.226
in the spiritual realm today.

508
00:20:09.226 --> 00:20:11.327
I often ask people when I'm in a seminar,

509
00:20:11.327 --> 00:20:13.263
would ya'll raise your hand if you've read a book

510
00:20:13.263 --> 00:20:14.865
on positive thinking.

511
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:16.900
And lots of hands go up.

512
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.401
And then I say please keep your hands up

513
00:20:18.401 --> 00:20:21.138
if you've only had positive thoughts for say the last week,

514
00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:22.706
all the hands go down.

515
00:20:22.706 --> 00:20:24.708
And of course those people assume,

516
00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:27.777
well if I'd read the book twice, if I highlighted it

517
00:20:27.777 --> 00:20:30.146
and really done all the exercises, then I too

518
00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.015
could be thinking positively.

519
00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:34.051
But they think it's their failure.

520
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:36.120
People teach the most outrageous things

521
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.788
in spiritual teachings today.

522
00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:40.457
Just focus and visualize and you can manifest anything

523
00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:43.493
you wish, well I found I have to work for it.

524
00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:45.261
That's what I found.

525
00:20:45.261 --> 00:20:47.530
Thomas Edison said most people miss opportunity

526
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.666
because it's dressed in overalls and looks like work.

527
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.204
Now I found work is an action, taking action is

528
00:20:53.204 --> 00:20:55.172
an important step in the process,

529
00:20:55.172 --> 00:20:56.506
rather than magical thinking.

530
00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.310
But it's very appealing to people because so many

531
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.046
of us and I say this with great compassion, really,

532
00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:05.915
but so many of us who say I'm interested in enlightenment,

533
00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:08.718
in spiritual growth, what we really are looking for

534
00:21:08.718 --> 00:21:11.187
is a way to feel good more of the time and feel bad

535
00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.156
less of the time.

536
00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:15.726
And so we find whatever we can to do that,

537
00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:19.130
and spirituality for many, the fascinations represent

538
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.197
a way to do that.

539
00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:24.067
I don't know, I've heard enlightenment described many

540
00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:26.937
different ways and I have a variety of ways myself

541
00:21:26.937 --> 00:21:29.172
because it's only something you can point to,

542
00:21:29.172 --> 00:21:30.940
it can't be described in words.

543
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.343
It's much simpler than people imagine.

544
00:21:33.343 --> 00:21:35.344
And deeper and wilder,

545
00:21:35.344 --> 00:21:38.281
but the most interesting definition I've heard is,

546
00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:41.885
it is having the psyche alternate between

547
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:45.188
being the heights of ecstasy and the depths of despair

548
00:21:45.188 --> 00:21:47.090
alternating at the speed of light.

549
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.591
<v Voiceover>Mmm.</v>

550
00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:53.213
<v ->It's a deep human state, it's not above human.</v>

551
00:21:53.797 --> 00:21:55.465
It's not beyond them, it's not a way to escape

552
00:21:55.465 --> 00:21:58.602
from the world, it's a way to enter the world completely,

553
00:21:58.602 --> 00:22:01.571
reality as it is, rather than all the extras we place

554
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:02.939
on top of it.

555
00:22:02.939 --> 00:22:04.874
Because we all look at the life through a window,

556
00:22:04.874 --> 00:22:07.110
a dirty window, a muddy window of our associations,

557
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.812
beliefs, opinions...

558
00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.347
<v Voiceover>All those filters.</v>

559
00:22:11.347 --> 00:22:12.415
<v ->Yeah the filters.</v>

560
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:14.551
So some people are extreme in that way

561
00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:15.986
and you say hello to them and they go,

562
00:22:15.986 --> 00:22:17.187
what did you mean by that?

563
00:22:17.187 --> 00:22:18.889
Because they're not hearing what you're saying.

564
00:22:18.889 --> 00:22:21.158
All those meanings they attach to it.

565
00:22:21.158 --> 00:22:24.460
So once one gets clear that the zen term of suchness

566
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.530
or isness, it's simplicity, directness,

567
00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.734
and Barbara Rasp, a write once said,

568
00:22:30.734 --> 00:22:33.637
the lesson is simple, the student is complicated.

569
00:22:33.637 --> 00:22:34.838
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

570
00:22:34.838 --> 00:22:37.007
<v ->And so simplifying our psyches can simplify</v>

571
00:22:37.007 --> 00:22:38.842
the way we approach life.

572
00:22:38.842 --> 00:22:40.777
<v Voiceover>So as you're speaking about these extremes,</v>

573
00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:44.647
where does the notion of the more Buddhist middle path

574
00:22:44.647 --> 00:22:47.584
come in, is that more or less what you're saying

575
00:22:47.584 --> 00:22:50.654
or you're saying it's a place we pass through or a place

576
00:22:50.654 --> 00:22:55.374
we more or less should look toward spending our time?

577
00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.827
<v ->Yeah, interesting question.</v>

578
00:22:57.827 --> 00:22:59.796
I deal with it in a number of different sources.

579
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:01.632
In my little book, The Laws of Spirit,

580
00:23:01.632 --> 00:23:04.601
the first law in the book, that this ageless woman sage

581
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.336
teaches me in the mountains

582
00:23:06.336 --> 00:23:08.404
is the law of balance.

583
00:23:08.404 --> 00:23:10.740
Now in Way of the Peaceful Warrior,

584
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.960
Socrates got up on his chair and railed against moderation.

585
00:23:16.046 --> 00:23:18.782
He said it's lukewarm tea, the Devil's own brew.

586
00:23:18.782 --> 00:23:20.750
And many people didn't get that because

587
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.218
of the Middle Way, the Buddhist teachings,

588
00:23:22.218 --> 00:23:23.987
all that wisdom, what is he saying?

589
00:23:23.987 --> 00:23:25.755
And that's why, one of the reasons I wrote

590
00:23:25.755 --> 00:23:27.823
Wisdom in the Peaceful Warrior was to explain

591
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:30.694
all that more thoroughly, and in brief.

592
00:23:30.694 --> 00:23:33.930
He wasn't saying that it's good to be all over the place

593
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.799
and out of balance, of course not.

594
00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:37.600
It's all about balance.

595
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.369
But it's also living a life of passion.

596
00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:42.706
So for example, it's not about always having

597
00:23:42.706 --> 00:23:44.675
the shower water just comfortable.

598
00:23:44.675 --> 00:23:47.210
Sometimes it's good to take a really hot shower

599
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.112
and sometimes a cold shower.

600
00:23:49.112 --> 00:23:51.748
And in that way, it's still a form of balance.

601
00:23:51.748 --> 00:23:53.316
Now if you always took super hot showers,

602
00:23:53.316 --> 00:23:55.918
or always took cold, maybe that's not so balanced.

603
00:23:55.918 --> 00:23:59.556
In the same way it's good to explore being really tired

604
00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:03.059
sometimes and also really resting at other times.

605
00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:06.129
But if people wanna be in the comfort zone all the time,

606
00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:08.131
they live a narrower and narrower life,

607
00:24:08.131 --> 00:24:10.033
pretty soon they don't wanna leave their house,

608
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:11.667
and everything has to be just so.

609
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:13.336
By going out and roughing it a little bit,

610
00:24:13.336 --> 00:24:16.039
camping's a wonderful way to remember the difference

611
00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.174
between wants and needs.

612
00:24:17.174 --> 00:24:18.341
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

613
00:24:18.341 --> 00:24:19.342
<v ->Find out what you need.</v>

614
00:24:19.342 --> 00:24:22.779
Shelter, clothing, if I'm cold and food when you're hungry.

615
00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:25.815
The rest is extras, just wants, which is okay.

616
00:24:25.815 --> 00:24:28.618
It's okay to want things, it's part of our human nature.

617
00:24:28.618 --> 00:24:30.519
<v Voiceover>Yeah, into a real good answer,</v>

618
00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.589
thank you for that, because that's one I tend to be

619
00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:35.392
a person more of extremes, it swings a bit

620
00:24:35.392 --> 00:24:37.761
from one side to the other and every now and then

621
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:39.395
rest in the middle and I've always thought

622
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:41.364
gee, I need to be more temperate in general

623
00:24:41.364 --> 00:24:43.032
which is probably still true,

624
00:24:43.032 --> 00:24:46.469
but what you say about the Middle Path,

625
00:24:46.469 --> 00:24:50.240
that would seem that it wouldn't give you much impetus

626
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.309
to bounce off of, to grow off of if you're always

627
00:24:53.309 --> 00:24:57.929
in that one predictably steady flow of comfort.

628
00:24:58.848 --> 00:25:00.550
<v ->Yeah, not to be there all the time.</v>

629
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.852
And we're not, everybody gets knocked

630
00:25:02.852 --> 00:25:04.220
out of their comfort zone at times.

631
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.591
If they catch a cold, get the flu or have a deadline

632
00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:09.392
at work, whatever it is.

633
00:25:09.392 --> 00:25:11.895
And that's okay, and then we come back

634
00:25:11.895 --> 00:25:13.196
to that balanced place.

635
00:25:13.196 --> 00:25:15.231
Because look the body has homeostatic mechanisms.

636
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:17.500
If it gets out of balance, we can die.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

637
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.069
<v ->So balance is a principle of nature.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

638
00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:21.404
<v ->But as human beings,</v>

639
00:25:21.404 --> 00:25:25.242
it's passionate to explore extremes now and then

640
00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.678
to come back.
<v Voiceover>For our own growth.</v>

641
00:25:28.678 --> 00:25:29.712
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

642
00:25:29.712 --> 00:25:30.813
<v Voiceover>For our own growth and understanding,</v>

643
00:25:30.813 --> 00:25:31.881
and experience.

644
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:34.383
<v ->I taught a knife fighting training for 14 years,</v>

645
00:25:34.383 --> 00:25:36.887
called the Courage Training, using knives

646
00:25:36.887 --> 00:25:38.822
as a method, a metaphor.

647
00:25:38.822 --> 00:25:40.824
We taught people off the street who'd never

648
00:25:40.824 --> 00:25:42.826
done martial arts, in three and a half days,

649
00:25:42.826 --> 00:25:44.594
they learned the equivalent of probably six months

650
00:25:44.594 --> 00:25:46.996
to a year training in most martial arts schools.

651
00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:49.198
In terms of being able to move without thinking,

652
00:25:49.198 --> 00:25:50.866
to think with the whole body,

653
00:25:50.866 --> 00:25:55.338
as Taisen Deshimaru, a Japanese sword master once said,

654
00:25:55.338 --> 00:25:57.540
to think with the whole body and to trust that

655
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.409
rather than just the left brain.

656
00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:01.277
The reason I mention this, it may sound like a tangent,

657
00:26:01.277 --> 00:26:04.146
but in this training, even learning a stance,

658
00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:06.515
even learning a basic stance in the martial arts,

659
00:26:06.515 --> 00:26:08.284
you apply balance.

660
00:26:08.284 --> 00:26:10.920
You don't wanna have the stance too long or too short,

661
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.556
too wide or too narrow, kind of the Goldilocks principle

662
00:26:13.556 --> 00:26:15.124
of martial arts.
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

663
00:26:15.124 --> 00:26:17.493
<v ->So balance certainly is an important thing in life,</v>

664
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:21.230
the Middle Way, but also to explore

665
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.966
the ranges of human experience.

666
00:26:22.966 --> 00:26:24.334
<v Voiceover>It makes perfect sense.</v>

667
00:26:24.334 --> 00:26:26.169
One of the books that I was drawn to

668
00:26:26.169 --> 00:26:28.872
and I wanted to ask you about and how you became

669
00:26:28.872 --> 00:26:31.941
aware of that particular science,

670
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:35.044
is the book The Life You Were Born to Live,

671
00:26:35.044 --> 00:26:37.378
which I thought would be a really good hands on place

672
00:26:37.378 --> 00:26:41.184
for people to go, to look at your typeology so to speak.

673
00:26:41.184 --> 00:26:44.320
And you have it based in the science of numerology.

674
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.789
How were you exposed to numerology initially

675
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:48.991
and became intrigued with and ultimately convinced

676
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.826
that this has real value.

677
00:26:52.186 --> 00:26:55.331
<v ->Well I only mention the word numerology one time</v>

678
00:26:55.331 --> 00:26:56.266
in the book.

679
00:26:56.266 --> 00:26:57.967
Because I am not a numerologist,

680
00:26:57.967 --> 00:26:59.736
and not to disparage numerology,

681
00:26:59.736 --> 00:27:01.437
there are many experts in the field.

682
00:27:01.437 --> 00:27:04.240
But the books I glanced at over the years,

683
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.609
just picked up briefly, looked through,

684
00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:09.079
checked out my numbers and all that,

685
00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:11.314
they seemed a little vague to me.

686
00:27:11.314 --> 00:27:13.617
The soul path, the destiny path, this path, that path,

687
00:27:13.617 --> 00:27:16.619
change your name and change your numbers, but--

688
00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:17.653
<v Voiceover>Change your name, change your life.</v>

689
00:27:17.653 --> 00:27:21.524
<v ->Yeah, right and it seemed like about 40% accurate</v>

690
00:27:21.524 --> 00:27:23.360
in my experience.

691
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.362
So I never had any interest in it,

692
00:27:25.362 --> 00:27:27.497
but then one day, and there's a longer story to this,

693
00:27:27.497 --> 00:27:30.233
I sometimes tell, I met an unusual teacher,

694
00:27:30.233 --> 00:27:32.535
one of the four primary mentors other than Socrates

695
00:27:32.535 --> 00:27:33.936
in my life.

696
00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:36.739
And he revealed in an advance training,

697
00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:38.607
me and about 19 other people,

698
00:27:38.607 --> 00:27:41.544
in Hawaii years ago,

699
00:27:41.544 --> 00:27:44.581
he revealed the essence, the basics, the fundamentals

700
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:47.517
of this approach, this interpretation of the numbers,

701
00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:49.986
that is different from other numerological systems.

702
00:27:49.986 --> 00:27:52.955
Many numerologists have used my book as a source

703
00:27:52.955 --> 00:27:55.792
because there are,

704
00:27:55.792 --> 00:27:57.427
well, I don't want to tell the long story,

705
00:27:57.427 --> 00:27:59.729
there's a martial arts analogy where people learn things,

706
00:27:59.729 --> 00:28:01.731
not quite right, almost right,

707
00:28:01.731 --> 00:28:04.900
and these interpretations and the way you add up the numbers

708
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.303
and work with them are just more accurate.

709
00:28:07.303 --> 00:28:10.307
So first of all,

710
00:28:10.307 --> 00:28:13.610
he gave me a reading, before I knew about any of this.

711
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.612
And it changed my life.

712
00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:17.280
What was hazy and fuzzy in my life all of the sudden

713
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.414
became clear.

714
00:28:18.414 --> 00:28:21.017
I saw the strengths I had, that I hadn't appreciated fully.

715
00:28:21.017 --> 00:28:23.652
I saw the hurdles I was here to overcome

716
00:28:23.652 --> 00:28:27.290
and he gave me the spiritual laws in order to do that.

717
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:28.491
It changed my life.

718
00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:31.628
That marks the moment I started teaching publicly.

719
00:28:31.628 --> 00:28:33.596
I was a couch, a gymnast before that,

720
00:28:33.596 --> 00:28:35.898
but I never was a teacher in this field

721
00:28:35.898 --> 00:28:37.199
until that time.

722
00:28:37.199 --> 00:28:39.635
So it really did have a massive influence on my life.

723
00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:41.538
Well when I learned he was teaching an advanced training

724
00:28:41.538 --> 00:28:43.540
and I could learn to do for other people

725
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.242
what he'd done for me, that was really exciting for me.

726
00:28:46.242 --> 00:28:49.312
And he revealed the system in a series of lectures

727
00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:53.616
and I only took twenty pages, small pages, of notes.

728
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.751
But I started working off the notes.

729
00:28:55.751 --> 00:28:57.787
The other people learned it just for themselves,

730
00:28:57.787 --> 00:28:59.556
but I always love to share whatever I learn,

731
00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:01.725
so I started doing readings for relatives and friends.

732
00:29:01.725 --> 00:29:03.660
And they were so amazed by it, you know.

733
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.528
Pretty soon I didn't need the notes anymore,

734
00:29:05.528 --> 00:29:07.196
I'd internalized the information.

735
00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:10.132
So after that I started doing readings for people in person

736
00:29:10.132 --> 00:29:13.002
when I went on travels, I'd make appointments with people.

737
00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:15.572
And it was so impactful for them, where I started I couldn't

738
00:29:15.572 --> 00:29:17.307
do individual readings for everybody,

739
00:29:17.307 --> 00:29:20.677
so I started making audio tapes and I eventually,

740
00:29:20.677 --> 00:29:23.513
the 37 life paths, made these tapes and people

741
00:29:23.513 --> 00:29:24.981
would get their date of birth and I'd send them

742
00:29:24.981 --> 00:29:28.284
the proper tape and I did that for some years.

743
00:29:28.284 --> 00:29:30.386
And it was only after about almost a decade

744
00:29:30.386 --> 00:29:32.588
that I decided it was time to teach other

745
00:29:32.588 --> 00:29:34.791
health professionals and they had to be either

746
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:38.194
a psychotherapist, a doctor, dentist, body worker,

747
00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:39.462
someone who works with other people,

748
00:29:39.462 --> 00:29:41.697
who can use it in the service of others.

749
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:43.866
And the training filled up immediately

750
00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:45.834
and I did a second one after that.

751
00:29:45.834 --> 00:29:48.171
But then I decided it was time to write a book,

752
00:29:48.171 --> 00:29:50.340
and that's when I wrote The Life You Were Born to Live.

753
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.809
Now people might say well wait a minute Dan,

754
00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:55.077
this makes no sense, how can you add up the numbers

755
00:29:55.077 --> 00:29:57.280
and your date of birth give you valid, reliable,

756
00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.582
accurate information about your core issues

757
00:29:59.582 --> 00:30:00.549
of your life.

758
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:03.753
Absolutely makes no sense, and yet it works.

759
00:30:03.753 --> 00:30:06.256
Anybody who's seen the book goes holy cow,

760
00:30:06.256 --> 00:30:07.557
<v Voiceover>It's good.</v>
<v ->it's a little scary,</v>

761
00:30:07.557 --> 00:30:09.625
and I did it for my friends, my parents,

762
00:30:09.625 --> 00:30:11.394
very interesting looking up one's parents

763
00:30:11.394 --> 00:30:13.896
or one's children because we don't know our parents

764
00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:17.067
in that way, we think they're just there for us.

765
00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:19.636
But to have lives of their own and life paths of their own,

766
00:30:19.636 --> 00:30:21.070
it's quite interesting.

767
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.306
And the reason I wrote the book was it helps us

768
00:30:23.306 --> 00:30:25.741
to have compassion for ourselves and for other people

769
00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.910
to really get insight.

770
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.845
And it's one of the most accessible tools.

771
00:30:29.845 --> 00:30:32.781
Astrology's great, the anagram stuff's interesting,

772
00:30:32.781 --> 00:30:35.051
I won't even get into that, I was trained

773
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:37.187
by the founder of the origin of all that

774
00:30:37.187 --> 00:30:39.288
before anybody ever heard of it.

775
00:30:39.288 --> 00:30:41.424
But this method, in the life purpose system,

776
00:30:41.424 --> 00:30:42.692
in The Life You Were Born to Live I think

777
00:30:42.692 --> 00:30:44.227
is the most accessible for most people

778
00:30:44.227 --> 00:30:47.330
to get some sudden insights and to validate

779
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.498
what they sort of knew in a funny way

780
00:30:49.498 --> 00:30:51.101
but becomes clear.

781
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.835
<v Voiceover>And you must have by now, at least,</v>

782
00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:58.841
10s of thousands of responses from people around the world

783
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:01.078
who've utilized this system.

784
00:31:01.078 --> 00:31:03.713
<v ->Yeah, probably almost a million people--</v>

785
00:31:03.713 --> 00:31:04.947
<v Voiceover>Almost a million people.</v>

786
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:06.315
<v ->worldwide by now, yeah.</v>

787
00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:07.250
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

788
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.352
<v ->And yeah it's quite, I get some good responses.</v>

789
00:31:09.352 --> 00:31:10.706
<v Voiceover>It really is because,</v>

790
00:31:11.156 --> 00:31:13.689
like you say in a lot of the numerology books,

791
00:31:13.689 --> 00:31:15.458
you look at yourself kind of broken down,

792
00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.927
a one through a nine and you get an archetype

793
00:31:17.927 --> 00:31:20.663
but this really does go into quite a bit more depth

794
00:31:20.663 --> 00:31:22.699
and you have 37 types.

795
00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:24.100
<v ->Right.</v>

796
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.735
<v Voiceover>Then can you explain that</v>

797
00:31:25.735 --> 00:31:27.370
because just because you're a type

798
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.572
doesn't mean you're a type.

799
00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:30.440
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

800
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.208
This isn't a personality test.
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

801
00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:33.943
<v ->This is really about our life purpose.</v>

802
00:31:33.943 --> 00:31:35.646
There are actually four purposes of life,

803
00:31:35.646 --> 00:31:38.313
I go into again, longer seminars, but this one,

804
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:41.884
the karmic purpose, the path we're to climb up the mountain

805
00:31:41.884 --> 00:31:43.086
that we're all climbing.

806
00:31:43.086 --> 00:31:44.887
We have different paths that we go up.

807
00:31:44.887 --> 00:31:47.723
Now why 37? Mathematically it just works out.

808
00:31:47.723 --> 00:31:49.125
You add up the numbers of people born

809
00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:52.494
in the 1900s and it comes out there are 37 combinations,

810
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:54.631
37 different numbers.

811
00:31:54.631 --> 00:31:58.734
But it doesn't mean we're all the same,

812
00:31:58.734 --> 00:32:01.070
because millions of people are working each life path.

813
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.406
If you divide 37 into the population of the planet.

814
00:32:03.406 --> 00:32:07.142
The analogy I draw is if I point to a tree outside,

815
00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:09.213
chances are there's not a single tree on the planet

816
00:32:09.213 --> 00:32:11.281
exactly like that tree,

817
00:32:11.281 --> 00:32:13.283
in the angle of every leaf, stem and branch.

818
00:32:14.784 --> 00:32:17.219
In the same way we're all unique as individuals.

819
00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:18.921
We've had our own genetic heritage,

820
00:32:18.921 --> 00:32:21.423
we have our own life experience.

821
00:32:21.423 --> 00:32:23.459
So every one of us is different and unique.

822
00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:26.763
And yet, I can say some things about regular trees

823
00:32:26.763 --> 00:32:28.631
that apply, that are different from birches,

824
00:32:28.631 --> 00:32:29.898
or aspens or oaks.

825
00:32:29.898 --> 00:32:32.702
In the same way we're working patterns in our life.

826
00:32:32.702 --> 00:32:35.438
And so I don't care how different someone's life looks,

827
00:32:35.438 --> 00:32:36.773
if they are the same birth number,

828
00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:38.275
same life path as someone else,

829
00:32:38.275 --> 00:32:40.277
they have a lot in common.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

830
00:32:40.277 --> 00:32:41.811
<v ->They work it out in different ways, however.</v>

831
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.245
<v Voiceover>Well it's interesting because</v>

832
00:32:43.245 --> 00:32:45.547
one of the prominent number in mine,

833
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:48.485
I had seen many, many times through the years

834
00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:50.820
and it's my least favorite number.

835
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.523
Of course, and you mention this because wherever

836
00:32:53.523 --> 00:32:56.726
our challenge is, that's not where we're going to resonate

837
00:32:56.726 --> 00:32:58.461
or be drawn to first.

838
00:32:58.461 --> 00:32:59.061
<v ->Right.</v>

839
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:00.196
<v Voiceover>Which is usually the area</v>

840
00:33:00.196 --> 00:33:02.031
that could use a better amount of attention

841
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:02.865
than other areas.

842
00:33:02.865 --> 00:33:03.866
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

843
00:33:03.866 --> 00:33:05.701
If I give the whole seminar, there's so much

844
00:33:05.701 --> 00:33:06.903
you can go into
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah.</v>

845
00:33:06.903 --> 00:33:08.438
<v ->in terms of what each number means and so on.</v>

846
00:33:08.438 --> 00:33:09.105
<v Voiceover>Yeah exactly.</v>

847
00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:12.408
<v ->But the purpose, we all know the story</v>

848
00:33:12.408 --> 00:33:14.276
about the six blind men that came on an elephant

849
00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:15.612
and one held the leg and one held the ear

850
00:33:15.612 --> 00:33:17.012
and one held the trunk and they all saw
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

851
00:33:17.012 --> 00:33:18.080
<v ->different creatures
<v Voiceover>Tried to describe</v>

852
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.616
the creature.
<v ->they felt a different creature.</v>

853
00:33:19.616 --> 00:33:21.217
Well in the same way, depending on which of my books

854
00:33:21.217 --> 00:33:22.218
somebody comes across,

855
00:33:22.218 --> 00:33:24.488
somebody discovers A Life You Were Born to Live first,

856
00:33:24.488 --> 00:33:26.823
they go on Dan Millman, he's a numerologist.

857
00:33:26.823 --> 00:33:27.556
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

858
00:33:27.556 --> 00:33:28.925
<v ->And somebody else, A Peaceful Warrior,</v>

859
00:33:28.925 --> 00:33:30.292
oh no no, he's an athlete who grew up

860
00:33:30.292 --> 00:33:31.895
and met this old guy,

861
00:33:31.895 --> 00:33:34.864
and No Ordinary Moments, the Laws of Spirit, very different.

862
00:33:34.864 --> 00:33:38.635
But all of them form a comprehensive course in living.

863
00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:43.706
And people who read just Peaceful Warrior,

864
00:33:43.706 --> 00:33:45.041
some of them read it six times.

865
00:33:45.041 --> 00:33:45.808
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

866
00:33:45.808 --> 00:33:47.343
<v ->And I really encourage them, look, you might</v>

867
00:33:47.343 --> 00:33:49.378
be better off reading six of my books once,

868
00:33:49.378 --> 00:33:52.047
because you're gonna get a much more

869
00:33:52.047 --> 00:33:53.849
broad scope of what it means to live

870
00:33:53.849 --> 00:33:55.496
as a Peaceful Warrior and how to do it.

871
00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:56.619
<v Voiceover>You mentioned Laws of the Spirit</v>

872
00:33:56.619 --> 00:33:58.487
a little bit ago and you said you'd go into that a bit.

873
00:33:58.487 --> 00:34:00.156
Can you do that, at this point?

874
00:34:00.156 --> 00:34:01.090
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

875
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.592
Well first of all, what is spiritual law mean?

876
00:34:03.592 --> 00:34:06.228
Many people use the terms, universal law,

877
00:34:06.228 --> 00:34:07.963
spiritual law, natural law.

878
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:11.101
The reason it's a law and not just a principle,

879
00:34:11.101 --> 00:34:15.037
an affirism, a saying, is I go into this again...

880
00:34:17.441 --> 00:34:19.475
When I was young, I was a pretty disoriented kid.

881
00:34:19.475 --> 00:34:21.811
If ignorance is bliss, I was ecstatic, you know?

882
00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:25.315
I was like what is this place, what are the rules here?

883
00:34:26.605 --> 00:34:28.751
So I started collecting quotations, it's been a hobby,

884
00:34:28.751 --> 00:34:30.186
a lifelong hobby of mine.

885
00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:33.389
And one day I came across one that said

886
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.258
a penny saved is a penny earned.

887
00:34:35.258 --> 00:34:36.792
That seemed true enough, common sense.

888
00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:38.294
But then I came across another quote that said

889
00:34:38.294 --> 00:34:40.496
nothing ventured, nothing gained.

890
00:34:40.496 --> 00:34:43.532
So you have to take risk too, it's not all about saving.

891
00:34:43.532 --> 00:34:45.801
And then I came across one, you can't teach an old dog

892
00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:48.805
new tricks, but you're never too old to learn.

893
00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:51.941
And other quotes that just contradicted one another.

894
00:34:51.941 --> 00:34:54.310
And so I was getting more confused than ever.

895
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.246
Then I came across a saying, a chain breaks

896
00:34:56.246 --> 00:34:58.147
at its weakest link, and I went yeah, yeah, yeah,

897
00:34:58.147 --> 00:34:59.314
everybody knows that.

898
00:34:59.314 --> 00:35:01.283
But then I thought about it and I went...

899
00:35:01.283 --> 00:35:03.086
I couldn't think of any contradiction.

900
00:35:03.086 --> 00:35:04.954
You take 10,000 chains, you break them,

901
00:35:04.954 --> 00:35:08.157
every one is going to break at its weakest link.

902
00:35:08.157 --> 00:35:10.526
It was the first time I got the idea of what it means

903
00:35:10.526 --> 00:35:14.430
to be a law, it's consistent, you can count on it every time

904
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.700
So also, it's not just chains we're talking about,

905
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.301
we're talking about us.

906
00:35:19.301 --> 00:35:21.970
And everything in the world, breaks at its weakest link.

907
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.555
I know because I've checked.

908
00:35:25.408 --> 00:35:28.378
So it's universal, it applies across every domain,

909
00:35:28.378 --> 00:35:30.412
not just to our relationships but also to our health,

910
00:35:30.412 --> 00:35:31.813
finances, everything.

911
00:35:31.813 --> 00:35:33.683
So by mastering and aligning ourselves

912
00:35:33.683 --> 00:35:37.320
with even one spiritual law which describes reality,

913
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.955
how it works, and the more realistic we get,

914
00:35:40.995 --> 00:35:43.560
the more aligned we are with the laws of nature,

915
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.795
the easier our life goes because we're not struggling

916
00:35:45.795 --> 00:35:47.330
upstream anymore.

917
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.531
We're starting to notice the current of life.

918
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:51.768
The Law of Surrender is one of the laws in the book,

919
00:35:51.768 --> 00:35:53.569
one of the 12 laws covered.

920
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:55.838
Which is really about, you know Byron Katie,

921
00:35:55.838 --> 00:35:57.807
wonderful teacher, she talks about that.

922
00:35:57.807 --> 00:35:59.909
Really all her work is about the Law of Surrender,

923
00:35:59.909 --> 00:36:03.379
not fighting reality and learning to make use of it.

924
00:36:04.319 --> 00:36:06.883
<v Voiceover>Very important point because a lot of people,</v>

925
00:36:06.883 --> 00:36:08.784
a lot of people watching this right now,

926
00:36:10.104 --> 00:36:14.323
a lot of us fight what is, trying to make something better.

927
00:36:14.323 --> 00:36:15.091
<v ->Right.</v>

928
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:16.192
<v Voiceover>And it doesn't work.</v>

929
00:36:16.192 --> 00:36:17.059
<v ->This should be,</v>

930
00:36:17.059 --> 00:36:17.993
that should be,
<v Voiceover>Instead of dealing</v>

931
00:36:17.993 --> 00:36:19.328
with what is.
<v ->my kids should be more mindful.</v>

932
00:36:19.328 --> 00:36:21.130
Right, yeah, dealing with what is.

933
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.666
One analogy I give is, I don't know if

934
00:36:24.666 --> 00:36:26.202
you've ever seen that bumper it says,

935
00:36:26.202 --> 00:36:28.604
if you don't like the way I drive, get off the sidewalk.

936
00:36:28.604 --> 00:36:30.072
<v Voiceover>Yeah I've seen that.</v>

937
00:36:30.072 --> 00:36:31.574
<v ->You know and some people, if a car comes at them</v>

938
00:36:31.574 --> 00:36:34.010
on the sidewalk they have an instant to see it coming

939
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.778
and the first thing in their mind is,

940
00:36:35.778 --> 00:36:37.413
they go, you shouldn't be on the sidewalk

941
00:36:37.413 --> 00:36:39.181
and boom, they get hit.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

942
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:41.183
<v ->Somebody else sees it and jumps out of the way.</v>

943
00:36:41.183 --> 00:36:43.018
The car whips by.

944
00:36:43.018 --> 00:36:45.387
That's making use, that's the Law of Surrender.

945
00:36:45.387 --> 00:36:48.024
It's real, it's happening, boom, let's deal with it.

946
00:36:48.024 --> 00:36:49.759
And just turning on a dime.

947
00:36:49.759 --> 00:36:51.394
If someone doesn't get their favorite dessert

948
00:36:51.394 --> 00:36:53.896
at a restaurant, oh well okay, it gives me a chance

949
00:36:53.896 --> 00:36:55.798
to order something new.

950
00:36:55.798 --> 00:36:58.101
Just like that, practicing that.

951
00:36:58.101 --> 00:37:00.702
And growing up, we've become stubborn, you know?

952
00:37:00.702 --> 00:37:02.338
People should be this way.

953
00:37:02.338 --> 00:37:05.775
Should is a big ones, for certain people especially.

954
00:37:05.775 --> 00:37:07.477
<v Voiceover>Yeah, what about staying flexible</v>

955
00:37:07.477 --> 00:37:08.637
through life?

956
00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.346
Just to finish on that
<v ->Sure.</v>

957
00:37:11.346 --> 00:37:12.648
<v Voiceover>those are incorporated</v>

958
00:37:12.648 --> 00:37:14.183
into the Life You Were Born to Live

959
00:37:14.183 --> 00:37:17.920
in with this typology so to speak, it gives you the laws

960
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.724
that you are best working with, basically to help,

961
00:37:21.724 --> 00:37:23.426
well you can say it better than I,

962
00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:26.061
but to help overcome whatever innate challenges

963
00:37:26.061 --> 00:37:28.363
there might be to live to your full potential, right?

964
00:37:28.363 --> 00:37:29.966
<v ->I thought you said it very well.
<v Voiceover>Oh.</v>

965
00:37:29.966 --> 00:37:31.968
<v ->Actually, but thank you for reminding me</v>

966
00:37:31.968 --> 00:37:33.736
because one of the most important parts

967
00:37:33.736 --> 00:37:36.438
of The Life You Were Born to Live, the reason it's so thick,

968
00:37:36.438 --> 00:37:39.041
it's a reference book, it has all 37 life paths.

969
00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:41.309
But many people get insight and they go,

970
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:43.113
oh yes, I'm this way and I'm that way

971
00:37:43.113 --> 00:37:44.913
and I always do this, I always wanna say,

972
00:37:44.913 --> 00:37:47.217
well now that you know that, what are you gonna do about it?

973
00:37:47.217 --> 00:37:50.586
And it gives spiritual laws that help overcome the hurdles

974
00:37:50.586 --> 00:37:52.188
in each individual life path.

975
00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:54.290
So different people have different key laws

976
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.427
that if they really pay attention to, can help

977
00:37:57.427 --> 00:37:59.861
exert the right leverage in their lives,

978
00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:01.230
to work more in the positive.

979
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.998
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

980
00:38:01.998 --> 00:38:03.699
<v ->And less in the negative attributes--</v>

981
00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:06.702
<v Voiceover>Mhm, I find it very well laid out that way,</v>

982
00:38:06.702 --> 00:38:07.937
very useful.

983
00:38:07.937 --> 00:38:10.006
<v ->It's said that a hard write makes an easy read,</v>

984
00:38:10.006 --> 00:38:11.874
and I put a lot of effort into it,

985
00:38:11.874 --> 00:38:13.108
it was a tough book to write.

986
00:38:13.108 --> 00:38:14.643
I don't even know how I did it sometimes.

987
00:38:14.643 --> 00:38:17.179
<v Voiceover>Yeah I bet, but you did it.</v>

988
00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:18.114
<v ->Yeah.</v>

989
00:38:18.114 --> 00:38:19.148
<v Voiceover>And I highly recommend anybody</v>

990
00:38:19.148 --> 00:38:20.449
watching this to pick up a copy.

991
00:38:20.449 --> 00:38:22.351
While certainly any one of them are wonderful,

992
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:24.253
my next one is the Journey of Socrates.

993
00:38:24.253 --> 00:38:26.655
I'm very excited to find out more about this man.

994
00:38:26.655 --> 00:38:30.625
And the journey in general through that.

995
00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:33.062
But I just brought up a moment ago,

996
00:38:33.062 --> 00:38:35.231
and you brought up the notion of flexibility

997
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:37.833
and life is an experiment.
<v ->Yes.</v>

998
00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:39.669
<v Voiceover>And not getting too locked into any one</v>

999
00:38:39.669 --> 00:38:40.703
of these things.

1000
00:38:40.703 --> 00:38:42.004
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1001
00:38:42.004 --> 00:38:44.573
Well the way I would express it,

1002
00:38:44.573 --> 00:38:47.542
somebody once said well Dan, there was another teacher

1003
00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:49.378
that I kind of resonate with more than you.

1004
00:38:49.378 --> 00:38:52.014
I said then you should be following that teacher.

1005
00:38:52.014 --> 00:38:54.918
Because there is no best teacher, no best writer,

1006
00:38:54.918 --> 00:38:58.955
no best religion, no best martial art, no best cooking style

1007
00:38:58.955 --> 00:39:03.560
only the best one for a given individual at a given time.

1008
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.195
And so we need to pay attention, what's best for us?

1009
00:39:06.195 --> 00:39:07.897
We don't have to find the highest master,

1010
00:39:07.897 --> 00:39:10.599
we have to find, not the one sitting on top of the mountain

1011
00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:12.035
but maybe the one a few feet ahead of us

1012
00:39:12.035 --> 00:39:14.269
who can reach back with a helping hand.

1013
00:39:14.269 --> 00:39:16.738
And that changes over time.

1014
00:39:16.738 --> 00:39:20.376
Our diet, what's appropriate for us may change over time.

1015
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.513
What martial art we enjoy may change over time.

1016
00:39:24.513 --> 00:39:26.783
But people get everything like a religion it becomes,

1017
00:39:26.783 --> 00:39:28.116
they become fundamentalists.

1018
00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:29.284
This is the way.

1019
00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:31.153
Because it was the way for them at a given time.

1020
00:39:31.153 --> 00:39:34.523
So that's why I haven't talked about my other mentors,

1021
00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:36.691
publicly.

1022
00:39:36.691 --> 00:39:38.928
And I may eventually write a book about it,

1023
00:39:38.928 --> 00:39:40.696
but it's not the time yet.

1024
00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:42.832
Because I don't want people thinking, oh wow,

1025
00:39:42.832 --> 00:39:45.468
that was Dan's teacher, that would be a great teacher for me

1026
00:39:45.468 --> 00:39:47.636
Not necessarily.

1027
00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:50.305
So we all have to find our own way and trust our instincts.

1028
00:39:50.305 --> 00:39:53.108
And that's why I remind people that I'm not here

1029
00:39:53.108 --> 00:39:55.011
for people to trust me, I'm here to help

1030
00:39:55.011 --> 00:39:56.712
them trust themselves.

1031
00:39:56.712 --> 00:40:00.949
That's really a key principle of the Peaceful Warrior's way.

1032
00:40:00.949 --> 00:40:02.818
Not giving away ourselves to someone else,

1033
00:40:02.818 --> 00:40:04.619
and I've had experience with that,

1034
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:07.056
again I'll tell that story some day.

1035
00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:10.526
But we're really here to, that spark inside of each of us

1036
00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:11.695
is guiding us.

1037
00:40:11.695 --> 00:40:13.530
And we're not here to become the Buddha,

1038
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.397
we're here to become ourselves fully

1039
00:40:15.397 --> 00:40:17.366
and therefore find that Buddha nature,

1040
00:40:17.366 --> 00:40:18.668
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>
<v ->in being ourselves.</v>

1041
00:40:18.668 --> 00:40:20.502
<v Voiceover>Mhm, absolutely.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1042
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:21.737
<v Voiceover>Beautifully put.</v>

1043
00:40:21.737 --> 00:40:24.907
And Joy, you and Joy, ultimately

1044
00:40:24.907 --> 00:40:26.343
<v ->Been married for 31 years
<v Voiceover>married 31 years</v>

1045
00:40:26.343 --> 00:40:27.243
<v ->Get's better all the time.</v>

1046
00:40:27.243 --> 00:40:28.277
<v Voiceover>Get's better all the time.</v>

1047
00:40:28.277 --> 00:40:30.346
How do you do that as a couple?

1048
00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:32.748
<v ->Well, let me answer in this way,</v>

1049
00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:35.317
on my website which is peacefulwarrior.com,

1050
00:40:35.317 --> 00:40:37.552
I have a blog I started a while ago,

1051
00:40:37.552 --> 00:40:39.821
and I said it would be a nice way to share ideas

1052
00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:40.523
that come up.

1053
00:40:40.523 --> 00:40:42.858
They're not a typical blog where I take a news item

1054
00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:44.460
and make some comments on it.

1055
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.162
They're little essays that I want to share with people.

1056
00:40:47.162 --> 00:40:49.365
And the first one I did was on The Secret,

1057
00:40:49.365 --> 00:40:52.234
and I'll move on from there, and other one

1058
00:40:52.234 --> 00:40:56.722
I did was on self-defense in the martial arts,

1059
00:40:57.373 --> 00:41:01.193
but the most recent one is on relationships.

1060
00:41:02.478 --> 00:41:03.779
<v Voiceover>Can you summarize that blog?</v>

1061
00:41:03.779 --> 00:41:07.616
<v ->Well, men are from Sears, women are from Nordstroms?</v>

1062
00:41:09.336 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Voiceover>That's pretty good.</v>

1063
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.022
My husband and I just had a talk about that,

1064
00:41:13.022 --> 00:41:16.191
he said we're really pretty simple, in a lot of ways,

1065
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:17.826
we're very direct.

1066
00:41:17.826 --> 00:41:20.196
<v ->Well I say at the start of the blog,</v>

1067
00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:23.833
that's why I haven't been on the media that much,

1068
00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:25.768
people haven't seen me on the national TV shows,

1069
00:41:25.768 --> 00:41:28.938
because TV shows, they like experts in a given field.

1070
00:41:28.938 --> 00:41:30.172
They like specialists.

1071
00:41:30.172 --> 00:41:32.174
They go well are you a relationships expert?

1072
00:41:32.174 --> 00:41:33.809
Are you a health expert?

1073
00:41:33.809 --> 00:41:35.977
Are you a money expert?

1074
00:41:35.977 --> 00:41:38.514
People you see a lot, they're experts in one of these areas.

1075
00:41:38.514 --> 00:41:40.916
I'm a very good generalist.

1076
00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:42.552
Because I understand spiritual laws

1077
00:41:42.552 --> 00:41:44.053
and how they apply to everything.

1078
00:41:44.053 --> 00:41:46.655
So I can wax forth and say moderately common sense,

1079
00:41:46.655 --> 00:41:50.058
hopefully intelligent things about almost any topic.

1080
00:41:50.058 --> 00:41:52.360
Not because I'm an expert on the topics,

1081
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.796
but I understand the principles underlying them.

1082
00:41:54.796 --> 00:41:56.432
And they don't know what to with that.

1083
00:41:56.432 --> 00:41:57.867
<v Voiceover>Well you're an expert on those principles.</v>

1084
00:41:57.867 --> 00:41:59.101
<v ->Well, on the principles yes.</v>

1085
00:41:59.101 --> 00:42:01.103
You wanna talk about spiritual law, I can talk about those.

1086
00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:02.838
<v Voiceover>Doesn't end up on the Today Show.</v>

1087
00:42:02.838 --> 00:42:04.306
<v ->No, it doesn't always work on Oprah, you know.</v>

1088
00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:09.078
So I wouldn't want to summarize the blog,

1089
00:42:09.078 --> 00:42:11.213
people can just access it anytime,

1090
00:42:11.213 --> 00:42:13.382
just go in, read about relationships.

1091
00:42:14.922 --> 00:42:16.518
<v Voiceover>A kernel that's worked for you.</v>

1092
00:42:16.518 --> 00:42:18.854
<v ->Okay well I will tell one story.</v>

1093
00:42:18.854 --> 00:42:22.024
I went to a wedding ceremony once, it was quite beautiful.

1094
00:42:22.024 --> 00:42:24.093
You see ritual is a way to reach the subconscious

1095
00:42:24.093 --> 00:42:27.396
so rituals happen in marriages and in transitions in life,

1096
00:42:27.396 --> 00:42:30.832
I value rituals, it's a shamanistic kind of idea.

1097
00:42:30.832 --> 00:42:33.335
And the religions use ritual a lot.

1098
00:42:33.335 --> 00:42:36.072
Well in this marriage ceremony, each couple walked

1099
00:42:36.072 --> 00:42:39.008
with a candle, beautiful, the flame, their own flame,

1100
00:42:39.008 --> 00:42:41.009
and then there was another candle there, a third one,

1101
00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:43.278
and with each of their flames, they merged their flames

1102
00:42:43.278 --> 00:42:46.615
and lit the other candle, which is beautiful.

1103
00:42:46.615 --> 00:42:48.383
But then you know what they did?

1104
00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:50.319
They blew out their own candle.

1105
00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:52.554
And I was like...

1106
00:42:52.554 --> 00:42:54.424
<v Voiceover>Isn't that interesting metaphorically.</v>

1107
00:42:54.424 --> 00:42:56.258
<v ->It was so sad, never blow out your own candle.</v>

1108
00:42:56.258 --> 00:42:57.926
We're here to be together and make that flame

1109
00:42:57.926 --> 00:43:00.629
that is we, but we are also individuals, we bring

1110
00:43:00.629 --> 00:43:02.364
our own selves into a relationship.

1111
00:43:02.364 --> 00:43:04.767
But to just become a we and give ourselves up

1112
00:43:04.767 --> 00:43:07.303
to a relationship, that doesn't enrich it

1113
00:43:07.303 --> 00:43:09.304
and we're here to become a whole greater than the sum

1114
00:43:09.304 --> 00:43:11.874
of the parts, that's what a relationship is.

1115
00:43:11.874 --> 00:43:13.208
That's only one of the things, I mean it's kind

1116
00:43:13.208 --> 00:43:15.811
of a long one because I had a lot to say on relationships.

1117
00:43:15.811 --> 00:43:18.580
But anyway, that was one story.

1118
00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.547
<v Voiceover>Well we'll check into it.</v>

1119
00:43:19.547 --> 00:43:22.484
Now that we all know it's there, we'll all check into that.

1120
00:43:22.484 --> 00:43:25.288
Anything else in summary, you've done so many

1121
00:43:25.288 --> 00:43:28.123
works and like you say, you are such a fabulous generalist

1122
00:43:28.123 --> 00:43:30.592
with an expertise in the laws underlying them.

1123
00:43:30.592 --> 00:43:34.881
Anything as sort of a wrap to this conversation?

1124
00:43:36.899 --> 00:43:38.067
<v ->The wraps are tough.</v>

1125
00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:40.035
<v Voiceover>You know, like the final thought or comment.</v>

1126
00:43:40.035 --> 00:43:41.837
If not, I've got a final question for you

1127
00:43:41.837 --> 00:43:43.605
of great importance.

1128
00:43:43.605 --> 00:43:47.176
<v ->Okay, well, I'd like to respond to your question</v>

1129
00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:48.276
of great importance.

1130
00:43:48.276 --> 00:43:49.979
<v Voiceover>Okay, the question of great importance</v>

1131
00:43:49.979 --> 00:43:52.248
is, is it true in the movie that you used to be able

1132
00:43:52.248 --> 00:43:55.050
to hold beers on your feet while you did handstands?

1133
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.953
<v ->Ah yes, that's a wonderful way to wrap up.</v>

1134
00:43:57.953 --> 00:44:02.090
No, in fact, the movIe only covers the first two thirds

1135
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.461
of the book, leaving out the most important part.

1136
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:06.862
But they managed to capture some of the spirit.

1137
00:44:06.862 --> 00:44:09.865
And they made gymnasts seem like regular guys,

1138
00:44:09.865 --> 00:44:11.500
like football players, you know?

1139
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.869
But really that wasn't too accurate and--

1140
00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:15.304
<v Voiceover>It didn't ring true.</v>

1141
00:44:15.304 --> 00:44:17.172
<v ->No, no, I mean maybe some teams.</v>

1142
00:44:17.172 --> 00:44:18.807
I know some teams probably do that.

1143
00:44:18.807 --> 00:44:20.276
<v Voiceover>It was a great stunt, I mean,</v>

1144
00:44:20.276 --> 00:44:21.610
but it didn't ring true.

1145
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.113
<v ->No, I mean we were in the 60's at Berkley, in the 60's.</v>

1146
00:44:25.113 --> 00:44:26.415
So we had some--
<v Voiceover>I know, I've seen--</v>

1147
00:44:26.415 --> 00:44:30.153
<v ->There were some wild times, but that was part of the times</v>

1148
00:44:30.153 --> 00:44:32.454
and mostly we were training and studying,

1149
00:44:32.454 --> 00:44:33.956
pretty much...

1150
00:44:33.956 --> 00:44:35.157
<v Voiceover>That's a pretty serious path,</v>

1151
00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:37.125
especially when you're trying to make the Nationals.

1152
00:44:38.294 --> 00:44:40.028
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and beyond.</v>

1153
00:44:40.028 --> 00:44:42.064
<v ->And training towards the Olympics.
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

1154
00:44:42.064 --> 00:44:44.065
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1155
00:44:44.065 --> 00:44:45.734
<v Voiceover>I would like to ask one question.</v>

1156
00:44:45.734 --> 00:44:46.568
<v ->Sure.</v>

1157
00:44:46.568 --> 00:44:48.637
<v Voiceover>Talking now, to you at your age,</v>

1158
00:44:48.637 --> 00:44:50.440
young people like you at your age,

1159
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.276
any final comments as to where they begin, right now?

1160
00:44:54.276 --> 00:44:55.977
<v ->Thank you for asking that, because I was trying</v>

1161
00:44:55.977 --> 00:44:58.079
to think of the other blog I wanted to mention.

1162
00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:00.349
I did one on the Trying Twenties.

1163
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:02.484
They call them the Trying Twenties because we try this,

1164
00:45:02.484 --> 00:45:05.188
then we try that, and that ties into that idea

1165
00:45:05.188 --> 00:45:06.788
that life is an experiment.

1166
00:45:06.788 --> 00:45:09.157
No one likes to hear it, but it can take 10 years

1167
00:45:09.157 --> 00:45:11.427
to really discover your calling.

1168
00:45:11.427 --> 00:45:13.595
People want to get out of college, become a consultant,

1169
00:45:13.595 --> 00:45:16.098
whatever, make lots of money right out of school

1170
00:45:16.098 --> 00:45:20.385
and it's a time of discovery and exploring who am I?

1171
00:45:20.736 --> 00:45:24.139
We have to find where our values, interests and talents

1172
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:26.975
intersect, to find our calling.

1173
00:45:26.975 --> 00:45:30.179
And people used to say about me, what's Dan doing this week?

1174
00:45:30.179 --> 00:45:32.915
So I think it's important for us to really respect our life

1175
00:45:32.915 --> 00:45:36.084
as an experiment, not just the way we eat or exercise,

1176
00:45:36.084 --> 00:45:38.253
but the way we live and our work in the world,

1177
00:45:38.253 --> 00:45:40.856
a form of service that matches our talents, interests

1178
00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:43.475
and values.

1179
00:45:44.026 --> 00:45:47.563
So that is what I would say to young people.

1180
00:45:47.563 --> 00:45:49.731
The advantage I have over anybody young now,

1181
00:45:49.731 --> 00:45:51.633
and they have lots of advantages over me,

1182
00:45:51.633 --> 00:45:54.703
but the one I have is, I've been 20, I've been 30,

1183
00:45:54.703 --> 00:45:56.972
and 40, and 50.

1184
00:45:56.972 --> 00:45:59.107
I can look back and have some perspective.

1185
00:45:59.107 --> 00:46:00.677
From a certain point on the mountain,

1186
00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:02.277
looking at the bigger picture,

1187
00:46:02.277 --> 00:46:05.113
whereas to them, life is right here, right now,

1188
00:46:05.113 --> 00:46:06.482
what do I need to do with my life?

1189
00:46:06.482 --> 00:46:09.117
And it's important to have patience,

1190
00:46:09.117 --> 00:46:13.221
to prepare well, to build a foundation of education.

1191
00:46:13.221 --> 00:46:15.257
Find out what you're good at, you know?

1192
00:46:15.257 --> 00:46:16.658
Find out what you're good at.

1193
00:46:16.658 --> 00:46:19.594
And remember there is more to life than you've been led

1194
00:46:19.594 --> 00:46:21.830
to believe and that's what I've hoped to do

1195
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.498
through my books, is to remind people

1196
00:46:23.498 --> 00:46:26.000
of life's bigger picture and higher promise.

1197
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.403
But while we function well in life as well.

1198
00:46:28.403 --> 00:46:31.840
Again, head in the clouds, feet on the ground,

1199
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.292
peaceful heart, warrior's spirit.

1200
00:46:35.944 --> 00:46:38.213
<v ->Dan is a real treasure and his books impart widsom</v>

1201
00:46:38.213 --> 00:46:41.316
that can truly guide us to a place of peace and power

1202
00:46:41.316 --> 00:46:42.684
in our own lives.

1203
00:46:42.684 --> 00:46:44.853
I found his book The Life You Were Born To Live
