00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Judith Orloff
walks in two worlds.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.400 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychiatrist who has
melded her practice in medicine

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.280 align:middle line:84%
with her work in the fields
of energy and intuition.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.110 align:middle line:84%
The combination of
these two skills

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.970 align:middle line:84%
allows her to take
her clients deep

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.000 align:middle line:84%
into their own transformation
and healing process.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:84%
As the author of books such as
"Second Sight" and "Positive

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Energy," Judith has been able
to help thousands understand

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:84%
why life can be such a drain
on our energies and emotions.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
She says for many
of us it has to do

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
with being overly empathic and
intuitive, and not knowing it.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
You've had an
interesting experience

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:90%
occur at a tender age.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about it,
and how it started shaping

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.395 align:middle line:90%
future events in your life?

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now I'm a psychiatrist,
and I work a lot with

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
intuition, but
when I was a child,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I would have all these intuitive
experiences that would happen

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that would scare me
a tremendous amount.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were
both physicians,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and I have 25
physicians in my family.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I have all of this
logical, linear, rational

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
family, and I was a little
girl who would predict things.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I would know if
someone was going

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to die, if someone was
going to get a divorce,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
if they were sick, if
someone was untrustworthy.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I finally had an
experience with my mother,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
where I had a dream
about her mentor

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
who was running for a
judgeship in Philadelphia.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:10%
Not only did he
lose the election,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:10%
but someone in the dream ran
up to him and bit his hand

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:10%
and really injured him.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And I told my mother about
this, and she said, oh,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.503 align:middle line:84%
why do you keep saying
these negative things

00:01:37.503 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%
about my friends.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And I felt horrible of course.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out the election
night he did lose the election,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and his daughter-in-law
had a psychotic break

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and ran up and bit his
hand at the polling place,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and was taken away to
a psychiatric hospital.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point
my mother forbade me

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to ever mention any of my
intuitions at home again,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up
believing that there

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:90%
was something wrong with me.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
That I was somehow knowing
about these things,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.350 align:middle line:84%
but I was causing them, at the
same time, which is not true.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Which is not true.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I went
through a long period

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of running from my
intuitions and feeling

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to escape it,
and I got very heavily involved

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
with drugs in the 60's
trying to numb myself out.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.945 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
feel your energy.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to know
what was inside of you.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to know anything.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want that sensitivity.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I had an
experience, around that time,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
where I went over
a cliff in a car

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:90%
one night, where I was partying.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I was out and I met this guy,
and we went up to Tuna Canyon--

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.096 align:middle line:90%
which is up near Malibu Canyon--

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.694 align:middle line:84%
We were talking,
and then the car--

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
we were not paying
much attention,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:90%
and the car went over the cliff.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And as we were turning--
we went over eight times,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I remember counting--

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I got catapulted to this
tunnel, where everything

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
was amazingly quiet
and blue green,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and just atoms whirling
at enormous speeds.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was in this
very quiet place

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:84%
as the car was going
over, and we landed.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Then I came back
from that place,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and I was unharmed, as he was.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:10%
So we climbed up the cliff,
and we went our separate ways.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It was the only time
I ever met this man.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing you went through--

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:90%
was he driving?

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he was.

00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So he just took you into
this experience, really?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we met that night,
we had the experience,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.696 align:middle line:84%
and then we left and
I never saw him again.

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So we were just meant to
go through that experience

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But after that
experience, my parents

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
forced me to go
see a psychiatrist,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
because they were so afraid
I was harming myself,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:90%
which I was.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And he-- the
psychiatrist that they

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
sent me to was the
first man who really

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
helped me to learn
about my intuitions,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and realized that I had
to embrace them in order

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:90%
to be whole and healthy.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So I began working through the
shame of having this ability.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And he got me started on
opening up to intuition,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.365 align:middle line:84%
and sent me over
to Thelma Moss, who

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
was a parapsychology
researcher at UCLA.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And while I was at Thelma's lab
working there as a volunteer,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream in which
a voice came to me

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and told me to-- that I
was going to get an MD

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and become a psychiatrist
to help legitimize intuition

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:90%
and medicine, very, very clear.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the
morning and I had--

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:90%
totally surprised.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I had no desire, conscious
desire, to do that.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I was more artistic, and living
in Venice Beach with my artist

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
boyfriend.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But because I was beginning
to trust my intuition,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I went and enrolled
at a junior college.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd been out of school, and
then one course became two,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
became 14 years of
medical training.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> How did that work for you,
going through the traditional

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
methodologies and
the root of medicine,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
knowing what you already knew
and what you were going to be

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:90%
bringing to it later?

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it took a lot
of patience and diligence

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.359 align:middle line:90%
on your part to go through this.

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Although you do have
a historical precedent

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.485 align:middle line:90%
in your family for it.

00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I do, but I had to learn
how to really exercise my left

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to learn science.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I was very artistic, and I never
learned how to really do that.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to learn,
and I had many angels

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
who came in my path
to help me to do that,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:90%
because I needed help.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I developed
a deep, deep love

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
for medicine and
the human body as I

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:90%
was going through my training.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And what was just really--

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, I fell in love when I
first started seeing patients,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
because I got to
sit by the bedside

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and listen to patients
tell their stories,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:90%
and it was-- it for me.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:90%
I always loved it.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I still-- it is what makes being
a physician so powerful for me.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I combine
traditional medicine.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I have a deep love for what I
learned in my medical school

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:90%
training about the body.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I was in surgeries seeing
the body exposed and holding

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
organs in my hand, and
seeing a heart pumping,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and holding the GI tract
in my hand, and the uterus,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:90%
and kidneys.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I saw everything, and
certainly from my intuition,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
touching these organs
really helped me,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.107 align:middle line:90%
because I remember things.

00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have the sense
memory in your hands,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and so, as working
with intuition,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that helps me tremendously
now because I remember.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I know the vibe of the body.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I know the energy in the body.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I continue to have a
deep love for medicine now,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and so I combine traditional
medicine with intuition.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a preference.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see them
as being interwoven.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just use the best
from traditional medicine

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and also intuition,
spirituality, subtle energies

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:90%
to help my patients.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Whatever will help, I will do.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any bias.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> So when someone--

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
when you first started
taking clients--

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
or patients, started
seeing patients,

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
did you immediately kick
in to the blend of both

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of your skills?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Or did you have to follow
protocols rather strictly,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
because you were
new at the game?

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.752 align:middle line:84%
Or how did this start
blossoming for you

00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning toward
what it is today?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I wrote--

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
this is my journey I wrote my
first book, "Second Sight,"

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and I really chronicled
everything that I went through.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But what was so
interesting is that, when

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I went into medical
school, I strayed very far

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
from the intuitive
realm, and I went

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
the exact opposite
direction for 12 years.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I would see patients come
in, rolling in on gurneys,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
claiming to be psychic.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And tied down, with the police
there, and saying, I'm psychic,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing the voice of God
and the FBI is out to get me,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:90%
and my food is poisoned.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we would take these
psychotic patients up

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to the inpatient wards
and medicate them

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
with Haldol, Thorazine,
and they would no longer

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
think they were psychic
or talking to God,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
or that their food was poisoned.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to
think that it was

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
dangerous and inappropriate to
use this ability in medicine,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because the only
example I saw were

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
these psychotic people
would come in, you know,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
who may or may not have
been intuitive and psychic.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's a mixed bag.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.049 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
take a person's history

00:07:53.049 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:90%
to find out what's going on.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So for 12 years, I went
the opposite direction,

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and my UCLA training program was
very heavily biologically based

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:84%
in that I learned how
to give out medication

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and learned about
the neurochemicals

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of human behavior, but very
little about anything else.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
That was my training.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating,
but limited.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Well let's talk about
psychosis for a moment.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Before we start going into
all the really juicy stuff

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that you've been writing
about in recent years and now,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:90%
what about psychosis?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
What did you begin to
understand over time?

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, it's
a mixed bag, and you

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:90%
go into personal history.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
You'll see someone
ranting on the street,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:90%
someone's talking to them.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
What do you have
to share with us,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
because that seems to
be increasing in nature.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot more people, the
lines are blurring.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And is it because
veils are blurring,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.810 align:middle line:84%
or because the mind is
actually having its own shift

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:90%
or breakdown?

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing
in that trend?

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Psychosis is so complex.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, it's a
biochemical imbalance

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that causes people
to suffer, and it has

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with psychic or--

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:90%
everything is spiritual.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So somebody is
schizophrenic, someone

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
having a psychotic
episode, there's

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
always a spiritual
component to it, always.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
The lesson that comes from
that, and why we experience

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:90%
anything in this world.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
However, when
people used to call

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
me having psychotic
episodes, they

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted to develop their
psychic abilities,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
but yet they couldn't take
care of their clothing,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:84%
or their food, or their
shelter, and they were just

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.579 align:middle line:84%
totally ungrounded, so it wasn't
the time or place to do it.

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:90%
And they used to get mad at me.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:84%
They said, but you're the
one we were told to come to.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
but first you have

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to take care of these
very basic life issues,

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll see.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.947 align:middle line:84%
When you're more grounded, we'll
deal with the intuitive issues.

00:09:34.947 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't never like that.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.636 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:09:37.636 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> They wanted something
a little more fun,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:90%
a little more quickly.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go into some of the
work that you've been doing,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because that
actually will lead us

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
into-- one of them I
wanted to get into which

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
has to be with energy vampires.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, they
told me to do it,

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
they've been trying
to make me do it.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's the
extreme psychosis end.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, a lot of people

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
do feel greatly impacted
by the energy of others.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
empathic, are intuitive,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
are actually hearing
things that are genuine.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
They're genuinely coming
to them for a reason.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Can we launch into that for--
is it appropriate at this time

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to go into that?

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wrote my
book positive energy

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the kind
of new psychiatry

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm pioneering called
energy psychiatry.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And what that is, is that
combines traditional psychiatry

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
with an appreciation of
spirituality and intuition,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and subtle energies,
and the unseen realm.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's so exciting to me to
bring all of those together.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at a
human being, not only as

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
flesh and blood, and the
material, which we all are,

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
but we have these subtle energy
fields that go through the body

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and expand way beyond the body,
the auras or the energy field.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And these interrelate
all the time,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and this affects health and
well-being, tremendously.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the ways that happens.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times people--

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
well, one thing that
you write about that

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
seems to be literally
an epidemic is fatigue.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.954 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's exhausted
and tired all the time.

00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are all the time--

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --if they haven't learned
to manage their energies,

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:90%
their biology, and so forth.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:90%
In terms of-- we can guess--

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.197 align:middle line:84%
we know a lot about the
biological realm of it,

00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and you have to feed your body,
exercise, fresh air, sunlight.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.446 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
energetic component

00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to that kind of an energy
drain that's happening in mass.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing that's really
important for people to know is

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
the concept that I discussed
called intuitive empathy.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And what intuitive
empathy is, is

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that some people, many people,
are very, very sensitive,

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and they can sense
energy at a distance,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
but they take on the energy
in their bodies like a sponge

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and become exhausted.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And so these walking energy
sponges, all around in life,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
not knowing how to work
with that or ground it,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:84%
not knowing at
all what happened.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
girl, I could not

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
go into shopping malls
or crowded places,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.124 align:middle line:84%
because I'd walk in feeling fine
and leave feeling exhausted,

00:12:02.124 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
or with some ache
or pain I didn't

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:84%
have before, or depressed or
anxious, or something not good.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That happens to me.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That happens to you?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It happens to a lot
of people, and they

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to make of it.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
language to describe

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:90%
what's happening to them.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And if they go to a
traditional doctor, who

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe in
these subtle energies,

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:90%
then they won't get any answers.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is they get sent

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
through a whole entire medical
work up, MRIs, blood tests,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
scans, and it usually
comes back pretty negative.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.664 align:middle line:84%
And then they get sent
to me, someone like me,

00:12:34.664 --> 00:12:35.955 align:middle line:90%
a psychiatrist to go on Prozac.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:36.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is not the
treatment for this.

00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:40.305 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:12:40.305 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk about what
the treatment for this actually

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just
say that, for people

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
who want to know if they're
an intuitive empath,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.279 align:middle line:84%
some of the telltale signs
to look for in themselves

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
are if you've been labeled as
overly sensitive all your life.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have a wonderful
little self-quiz on your site.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
On page 29 of "Positive
Energy," and on my website,

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I have a quiz.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Have you been labeled
as overly sensitive?

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you go home alone to refuel?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Are you very sensitive to noise,
sounds, or excessive talking?

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Do go to the refrigerator
to overeat when

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:90%
you're around negative energy?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you prefer being by
yourself a lot of the time?

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you take your own car places,
because you want to get out?

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Now those kinds of things.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:84%
They're telltale
signs of an empath.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.239 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
watching this

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
would probably fall
in that category.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh you have no idea how many
people email me and write me

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
about being an empath, and how
it was a huge revelation and no

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:90%
one has put a name to it before.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's really something
that needs to be

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
incorporated in the psychiatric
diagnostic criteria.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Rather than have your
family just shout out,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.237 align:middle line:90%
you need thicker skin.

00:13:47.237 --> 00:13:48.036 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't do it.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
You need a thicker skin,
or what's wrong with you,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:90%
toughen up.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, toughen up.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the point
is, if you want

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to experience spirituality
and intuition,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and go beyond the material,
sensitivity and empathy

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
is your way in.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
something you want.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But you have to learn how to
manage the downside of it,

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.335 align:middle line:84%
which is taking on the energy of
others or being so overwhelmed,

00:14:12.335 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
in our coarse world, that you
don't know how to function,

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
so you want to withdraw
and become a recluse.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:16.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:90%
So you don't want that.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But see, the problem
is most people don't

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
know how to manage their
energy, so they get diagnoses,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
such as fibromyalgia, or
chronic fatigue, or you know,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
various mystery symptoms
that nobody can ever explain,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but they're very debilitating,
or irritable bowel syndrome.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of
energetic disturbance

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
can aggravate or cause
those kinds of disorders,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and so it's very important
to take an energetic history

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself if you're
an intuitive empath.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And with all of my
patients, I talk to them

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
about how they process
energy in the world.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And some people
don't take on energy.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:90%
You know, I have--

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.287 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't-- one is
not better than the other.

00:14:59.287 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.953 align:middle line:84%
It's just I'm bringing
up intuitive empathy,

00:15:01.953 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's such an
issue for so many people,

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and it has been for myself.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.345 align:middle line:84%
But some people are very
solid earth-centered bodies,

00:15:08.345 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and they could be
around anything

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't come in.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> All right?

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That's not my body, and it's
not a lot of people's body,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:90%
but it's OK.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can still be
intuitive, and sensitive,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and open, with a body that
doesn't take on energy.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:84%
However, if you do have a
body that takes on energy,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and you have that
sensitivity, it

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
can really work
for you, because it

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
lets you probe into
the depths of things,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:84%
into the deep core
center of things.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to know about
the nature of the universe

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.479 align:middle line:84%
and life, because
you're able to sense it.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is good.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is good.

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you do about
the downsides, though?

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Just-- I know you can't reveal
everything in your books,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:90%
because we don't have time.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But just to give us a little
hint of some of the things

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
we can do, if we're
empathic by nature,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to keep our own
energies more intact.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of the first
symptoms and signs

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
you see, and some of the
quick fixes you can do.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
that everyone must do

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:84%
is use your intuition
when you're around people,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and ascertain if your
energy goes up around people

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:90%
or down around people.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a body intuition.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.082 align:middle line:84%
And not to have your
head talk you out of it.

00:16:19.082 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
be around somebody

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
who's smart and funny, and
successful and attractive,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
whatever they have, but yet
your energy is going down

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.149 align:middle line:84%
and you want to take a nap
after you're with them.

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:31.315 align:middle line:90%
You don't marry that person.

00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:32.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't go out
with that person.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.267 align:middle line:84%
It seems logical, but
people don't know that.

00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's just they have
everything on the list.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the list, but can't--
they don't have the vocabulary

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to say, that's fine, but also on
my list is that my energy needs

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to be compatible
with this person.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Very essential point.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.264 align:middle line:84%
>> No, that's not
on anybody's list.

00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:54.055 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully it will be
more on people's list.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not on our list
for people that we marry.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not on our list for
jobs that we take, friendships.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about how
indiscreet we are as a species,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
at this point, and really take
a little deeper look at that,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:90%
what we do to ourselves.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yes, I think to really
take good care of yourself,

00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
own positive energy,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
you need to ask
yourself that question,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:90%
and not talk yourself out of it.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:84%
And other people will try
and talk you out of it,

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know about energy.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
At least the ones that
don't know about energy

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:90%
will try to talk you out of it.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't about
getting a popular vote

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:90%
about how you feel.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
This is just simply about
how you experience somebody.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the criteria.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have to learn
how to trust yourself.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
gravitate towards people

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
who have positive
energy, and these people

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
will feel nurturing,
your energy will go up,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel better
around them, and you'll

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.672 align:middle line:90%
feel uplifted and brighter.

00:17:48.672 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And some days you
might want to hug them,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
or your body wants to
get closer to them.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
You're not crossing
your arms or going back,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.320 align:middle line:84%
or you know, all
those things where

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
you're not comfortable
with someone's energy.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So you need to find
people like that,

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and use your body
to tell you who

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:90%
it likes to go to, basically.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And then,
alternatively, you have

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to sense the energy
vampires, the people who

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:90%
suck your energy dry.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And how do you know you're
around one is that you're--

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
suddenly you feel like taking a
nap, or you start feeling sick,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
or you start feeling tired.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
times, empaths can

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
get actual physical symptoms
around an energy vampire.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.901 align:middle line:84%
You can get your
heart palpitating,

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.775 align:middle line:84%
you could start feeling
sick to your stomach,

00:18:31.775 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:90%
you know, all kinds of things.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
However your body reacts,
these are all signs.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to, first of
all, notice who you react to

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and how your energy is
doing around people.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you simply ask
yourself that question,

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that will give you a whole new
awareness of relationships,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:90%
and jobs, and--

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just
going to bring up--

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> --places.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --those are two
of the words I wrote.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's very true.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
People put themselves
in situations--

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's on the list,
it seems like a good thing,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:90%
there's job security--

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
when it's a complete mismatch
for their energy all the time.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you guide people
in this, when they've just

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
invested, say, 10 years of
education into something that

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:90%
really does not serve them?

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.865 align:middle line:90%
>> In terms of a job or--

00:19:12.865 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of their lives, how
do you tell someone that's done

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.824 align:middle line:84%
this, oh, I'm sorry, but what
you do is a total mismatch

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:18.623 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:19:18.623 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Look at the evidence
is right there.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.949 align:middle line:84%
Every time you-- every
day you go to work.

00:19:21.949 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, sometimes it's not
the actual field that you go

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.370 align:middle line:84%
into, but it could be the job
environment that's unhealthy

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
for you and not in energetic
sync with who you are.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And so for instance, if you
have a bully boss, or an energy

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:84%
vampire who criticizes you, and
judges you, and is rude to you

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
every day, day after
day, that's going

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to take a toll on
you, especially

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
if you're an intuitive
empath you're

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.140 align:middle line:90%
going into that environment.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make certain
choices in that environment.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
If possible, it's good not to
work with people like that.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.325 align:middle line:84%
If possible, if
you have a choice.

00:19:54.325 --> 00:19:55.324 align:middle line:90%
>> What if you don't?

00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
What if you're there,
you love your job,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
but this person is a real
pain to you, an energy suck?

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you correct that?

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends what kind of
energy vampire they are.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I go through a number
of energy vampires,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and one in a work environment
is very common is a drama queen.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody who wears
you out with off the chart

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.217 align:middle line:90%
dramas all the time at work.

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Where they can't get into
work because their car--

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
their tires are flat, or
they couldn't get a ride,

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
or they have the flu
and are about to die.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing after
another, after another.

00:20:26.197 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And they come up to you
at your lunch break,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
replenish yourself,

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're, yeah,
going on and on and on.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.369 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, what do you do
in situations like that?

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
The drama queen is actually
the easiest energy vampire

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to deal with, because the way
to deal with a drama queen

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
is not to ever ask him
or her how they're doing.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:90%
You never do that.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And you don't give
them any juice,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.009 align:middle line:90%
when they start revving up.

00:20:49.009 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay calm,
you have to breathe,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:90%
you have to stay centered.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.572 align:middle line:84%
And you have to say, God, I'm so
sorry that's happening to you.

00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, I hope you
really get it figured out.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.571 align:middle line:84%
I'm so sorry, I've got to
go back to my work now.

00:20:59.571 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And use the body
posture to move the body

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in the opposite direction,
instead of sitting like this

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.295 align:middle line:84%
and saying, oh my God,
tell me what happened.

00:21:06.295 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Go into that a
little bit more?

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> The body posture?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, if you're
talking to somebody

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're genuinely
concerned about them,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
but you realize you have to
set limits with this person,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:84%
you can cross your arms,
you could cross your legs.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.866 align:middle line:84%
You can turn towards the desk
and start looking at the paper,

00:21:21.866 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:90%
and then look back at them.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
You give them a message
through your body language

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
engaging with them.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
kind but firm tone.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't look at
them and say, I

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
am sick and tired of all this
drama, you've got to stop it.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you're kind of
buying into it there.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But you're feeding
that energy in a bit,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
even though they may
not come back to you.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't feel good
for either of you.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no they--

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:90%
they will-- they will amp it up.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> If that doesn't work.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the way to
approach an energy drain,

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
an energy vampire, is to
have a kind but firm tone,

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
be very consistent
and non-reactive.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Because energy vampires
feed off of your reactivity.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're getting
upset, you're getting angry,

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting frustrated,
they're getting what they want.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.983 align:middle line:84%
>> You've engaged, and they've
got some energy to feed off of.

00:22:08.983 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you're
not cold or disrespectful.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
What about-- OK, you say that's
the easiest to deal with.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
What about the control
freak in the office?

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the control
freak is your boss.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the boss is
the hardest example,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:84%
because they have power over
you in that they tell you what

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:90%
to do for your job.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
ways to get around it.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Number one, bullies,
bully bosses,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
only seem to pick workers
who are the victims,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and they go right to the victim.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't give off an
energy that you're a victim,

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and that you're cowering
or you are afraid,

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
they tend to not be
attracted to you.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.524 align:middle line:84%
So bullies don't
bully other people who

00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:90%
can stick up for themselves.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's just a fact.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're able to have
a certain amount of confidence,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and you set your energy
very centered and firm,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and not going to go into
it, as opposed to cowering

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or acting afraid,
then they're less

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:90%
likely to come back to you.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And also with a bully
boss or a controller,

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
you can never
control a controller.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the wrong approach.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really
pick your battles

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and be very concrete about
what you'd like to do.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to frame it in
terms of it being in their best

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.935 align:middle line:90%
interest.

00:23:26.935 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Give us an example of that.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.765 align:middle line:84%
So you have reframed
the situation.

00:23:31.765 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the energy
vampires who are controllers

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
are the narcissists, and
narcissists are everything

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:90%
about life is me, me, me.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.289 align:middle line:84%
And narcissists can be
charming and wonderful people,

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
but-- as long as you go
along with their program.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But when you get off
the program and you

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
do something that
doesn't agree with them,

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
then they can be very vicious
and cold, and withholding.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And narcissists are
energy vampires,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
because they lack
an empathy chip.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't have empathy
for other people.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge omission.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a crippling of
the heart that happens.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And so with a
narcissist, you always

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
have to frame it in terms
of their best interests.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
For instance, let's say you
wanted to work different hours.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say, I need
to work different hours,

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:84%
because I want to be
home with my children.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.232 align:middle line:90%
You can't put it that way.

00:24:19.232 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
You've got to say, I'm
working different hours,

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
because it will really help
financially help the company

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:90%
and help you.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to frame
it to be about them.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a little maneuver
and it's a hassle,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, you don't
going to keep doing that.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to have
successful communication

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
with a narcissist
or a controller,

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
you have to put it in
their best interests

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:90%
and not try and control them.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a
Zen dance with them.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> What if it's the kind of
controller that's operating out

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
of fear, fear that everything's
going to fall apart?

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not a
narcissist, per se,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
they just have to
stay hypervigilant

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
or the whole thing's going
to hell in a handbasket.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on fear.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So and-- you know, you
look at energy vampires,

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:84%
we all have the
tendencies in us.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have this, but the
great thing about positive

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:84%
energy and mindfulness is that
you can see when you're doing

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:90%
it, and make an effort to stop.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.184 align:middle line:90%
And we can correct ourselves.

00:25:11.184 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to
the fearful person,

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because I think most of us
have that within our spectrum

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
of friends, family members, that
just really have to stay on top

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
just in case everything is going
to go apart on them and they

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:90%
can't-- they can't handle it.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
They won't know what to do.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:23.785 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you deal with
that kind of controller?

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends how
it's affecting your life.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
If it's just
affecting their life,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
you let them do it and you
don't intervene at all.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But if it's affecting
your life, you

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
have to keep setting
defined limits with them

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.700 align:middle line:90%
about how to interact.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So that they don't
impose themselves on you.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And this happens a lot with
in-laws, where in-laws come in

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and they try and impose all
their attitudes, and needs,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and desires on the couple.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to just
tactfully, you know, say, no,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:84%
this isn't-- we'll do
this, but we won't do that,

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and just gradually
chip away at it.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.644 align:middle line:84%
>> What about-- you
alluded to this earlier,

00:26:00.644 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to get into it.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, when people are
super empathic, a lot of people

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:84%
that are psychic and intuitive,
head to the refrigerator.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.857 align:middle line:84%
What is this about the
pain of being that open

00:26:12.857 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and taking it on
that it makes us head

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
to the refrigerator for comfort,
and that whole spectrum,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people I
know that are really, really

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
psychically endowed often carry
a lot of extra weight too.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is such
an interesting topic

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:84%
to me, because around
the turn of the century,

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
the faith healers are typically
women who are very obese.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:84%
They were about 300 pounds,
250 pounds, really big.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And they claimed
they needed to have

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.080 align:middle line:84%
all that fat on them to do the
healing work, because when they

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
put their hands on
the patients, all

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
the pain and the negative
energy would come up

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and they would absorb
it into their own body,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and it would be too
painful unless they

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:84%
had all the mass
around them, simply

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
mass that buffered, you know,
the negativity from coming in.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have that
mass, you have a very thin body,

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.327 align:middle line:84%
you're more vulnerable
to feeling things.

00:27:06.327 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the prevailing
thought, you're saying,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Prevailing-- it's
not only at the time.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.406 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of healers
now who are overweight,

00:27:14.406 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and they claim they
need to be that way

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:90%
in order to do the work.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is true that fat buffers
negative energy, yes, it does,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's an unhealthy
coping mechanism.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
other ways of dealing

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
with negative energy and
other people's pain other

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:90%
than taking it on the body.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:84%
That's one method of healing is
taking it on in your own body

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:90%
and filtering it.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:90%
That is not my way.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.904 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any desire to
take on your pain in my body.

00:27:39.904 --> 00:27:40.703 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:40.703 --> 00:27:41.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:41.601 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Wise.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I said that's wise.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't do that.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, because you
can heal in other ways.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:84%
You can heal simply
by being a conduit

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and not taking something
on in your body.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But the old view of
healing was that you

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
need to shoulder it for another
person in order to purify it,

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:90%
and that's not--

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
need the weight--

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.730 align:middle line:84%
they feel they need
the weight to do that.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But another way to deal with
being open and sensitive

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and even
doing healing work,

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.585 align:middle line:84%
is to deal with the
energy differently.

00:28:14.585 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And number one-- I mean, this
sounds like a really simple

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.420 align:middle line:84%
solution, but whenever you
are around negative energy,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:90%
you have to breathe.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep
breathing it out,

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
because people
hold their breath,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:90%
their own negative energy.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They get scared and
they clamp down.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have-- when you're around
somebody who's criticizing,

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
who's angry at you,
is controlling you,

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever people do,
or irritating you,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:84%
frustrating you, annoying
you, start breathing.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You have to breathe,
breathe, breathe,

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:84%
so that the energy
gets filtered out.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You want the energy
filtered out.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
ask yourself, all right,

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:90%
how will I handle this?

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And you do it from a
calm and centered place.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.480 align:middle line:90%
You never react to the person.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Just reacting to them,
that will never work.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to
really center yourself.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And you might be able to
talk to them at a time,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:84%
or you might want to go away
and then come back again

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and readdress it, which
is really important.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Another quick way to get
rid of negative energy

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
is to get in water, to
either wash your hands,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
or get in the bathtub or in the
shower, anything with water.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And even drinking water helps,
because water is a purifier.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural purifier.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
to drink water.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're done
with the negative person,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:84%
it's very important to
meditate right away,

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and to center
yourself, to breathe,

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to bring yourself
back and solidify

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.470 align:middle line:84%
your inner core or your
heart, so that you're there

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't taken
anything from you.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're jangled and you
want to come back to center.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yes.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And so to meditate-- there's
a three minute meditation I

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
talk about in positive energy,
which I use all the time

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always bringing
myself back to center.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Just the world is
always throwing me off,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:90%
and I'm always coming back.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Happens all the time,
so it's very practical,

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and I'm dependent on it.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm used to it now.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So breathing, water,
and immediately going

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:90%
into meditation.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, utilizing water.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I found-- I used to find
if I go into a place,

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.510 align:middle line:84%
especially as I got
older and more sensitive,

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.961 align:middle line:84%
say to a place to dance where
there's really loud music,

00:30:21.961 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I would find I wouldn't
be able to even go

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to sleep that night if
I didn't take a shower,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and really just get the
jangly energy out of my field.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's not even
necessarily negativity,

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:90%
it's just too much.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.102 align:middle line:90%
It's an overload.

00:30:34.102 --> 00:30:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:84%
What happens in this
world, we have--

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:84%
where we have so
much sound pollution,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
people, noise,
talking pollution,

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:84%
every kind of
pollution going on.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.460 align:middle line:84%
How do you manage
that in your own life?

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you try to
minimize your contact,

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.950 align:middle line:84%
or do you just use the
techniques you know?

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it depends.

00:30:55.027 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:84%
If I'm out in the world, I do a
lot of traveling and teaching,

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:84%
so I have to go
in airports, which

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.168 align:middle line:90%
are the bane of my existence.

00:31:00.168 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
They're the hardest part for
me as being an empath, going

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
in airports, with
the loudspeakers,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and the masses of people,
and the lack of aesthetics.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's just they're
horrible places for me,

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of my
sensitivity, so I've

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.700 align:middle line:84%
had to learn to really
center myself in airports.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I go into the
bathroom in airports a lot

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and do the three
minute meditation,

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:84%
so that I can center
myself and go out again

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:90%
from a better place.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And also going through
security is very hard for me.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you mean when they're
roughing you up and have you

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:84%
take your clothing
off, and so forth?

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.091 align:middle line:90%
I get that one.

00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We're in airports
a fair amount too.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and they
put you through--

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.595 align:middle line:84%
some of these airports put
you in these horrible machines

00:31:41.595 --> 00:31:42.580 align:middle line:90%
called puffers.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.282 align:middle line:84%
And they don't tell you--
they close the door,

00:31:45.282 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
which to an empath, you don't
want to be in a closed space.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it makes
the horrible noise,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and this powder puffs up.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.842 align:middle line:90%
It's a horrible experience.

00:31:53.842 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I have never
been in the puffer.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.354 align:middle line:90%
>> It's some-- it's--

00:31:56.354 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
well, hopefully you will
never go through one.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- you
know, for an empath,

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.066 align:middle line:84%
it's a horrifying experience
to have to go through.

00:32:02.066 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
warn you about it,

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and then they just send
you on your way afterwards.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the most insensitive thing.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that going
through life, airport security,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of things,
a very noisy world,

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
we have to really
learn to work with it.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.618 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after that
experience, I'll

00:32:18.618 --> 00:32:21.100 align:middle line:84%
go in the bathroom and
meditate, instead of just

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:90%
being upset and jangled.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll meditate and I'll
come back to myself again.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the
subject of creativity.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Often we put that at the
very end of our list.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if I have any energy or
time left I'll get around

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.277 align:middle line:84%
to my dancing, or my drawing,
or whatever it is I love doing,

00:32:37.277 --> 00:32:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and then it drops off the
list, because we're too tired.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to use and
access our creativity don't we?

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> If you're moved to, yeah.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is all
about intuition.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.735 align:middle line:84%
It's about opening up
to the flow of life

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and letting it move you,
and whatever you do,

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.990 align:middle line:84%
it can be cutting a flower,
or it can be walking down

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the street creatively,
it could be dancing,

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
it could be writing, it could be
painting, it could be anything.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Creativity is anything.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But it-- what's so
wonderful about it

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.556 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to
open up to a larger flow

00:33:08.556 --> 00:33:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and let it flow
through you, and that's

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:84%
why it's so healthy,
because you get cleansed

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and you get purified through
the creative energies,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
because you're forced to open
and not just stay in your head.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't just be in your
head and be totally creative.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Certainly there's
intellectual creativity,

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.310 align:middle line:84%
but there's more than
intellectual creativity.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you open up and you're
a conduit for another force

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to flow through you,
then all kinds of things

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.410 align:middle line:84%
can happen that are
just totally amazing.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've devoted so much
of my life to my creative life,

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:90%
especially writing a book.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I could-- I just
finished a book,

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and I was basically writing
for four years for me

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to write a book.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means a
lot of alone time

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
in my interior world opening up
to whatever flows through me.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
expands my intuition,

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and my soul yearns for it,
that kind of expansion.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.175 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it's absolutely
essential, it's a criteria.

00:34:03.175 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's one kind of trepidation
I have about a relationship,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.020 align:middle line:84%
a romantic
relationship, because I

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
need to have my alone
time as an empath

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
and as a creative person to
write without intrusions,

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.171 align:middle line:84%
and I can feel if someone's
hovering by the door.

00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:18.971 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:34:18.971 --> 00:34:19.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:19.783 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's intrusive to me.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's worked before,
but somebody would really

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:84%
have to honor my creativity
in relationships for them

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy living
in the same space

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
or spending a lot of
time in the same space.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Someone would have to really
understand that about me,

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's not something I can
give up, nor would I want to.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going inward,
creativity, and connecting.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And for me this is my passion
is going inward and connecting

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
to myself, but
also to everything.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
It starts here and then it
expands to every single thing,

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and I love that.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and that kind of
creativity is the kind--

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.630 align:middle line:84%
as you say, there's a difference
between that and intellectual

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:84%
creativity in that that's the
time that moves beyond a time

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.580 align:middle line:90%
space continuum, for example.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind that
makes time stand still.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we each go inside
and ask ourselves,

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:84%
what is it that makes
time stand still for me,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.504 align:middle line:84%
might we be getting close
to the kernel of where

00:35:13.504 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:84%
we should be spending a
little bit more of our time?

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, time standing
still is good.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Quincy Jones
for "Positive Energy,"

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about creativity
is waiting for the goosebumps.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That he doesn't do anything
until the goosebumps come.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So that might be a little
bit more relatable than time

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:90%
stopping.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.200 align:middle line:84%
That time stopping is quite an
amazing experience, isn't it,

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:90%
when hours go by.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's how it is for
me in any creative endeavor.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea
where I am in time.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.424 align:middle line:90%
I do too.

00:35:43.424 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes I don't know
what day of the week it is.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask people.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it Thursday?

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it Monday?

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when I'm writing
because, I just don't--

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I surrender so much.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.365 align:middle line:84%
I lose that sense of time and
space, which is really nice.

00:35:55.365 --> 00:35:56.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:56.165 --> 00:35:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I enjoy it.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think for everyone
to experience creativity

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.189 align:middle line:84%
it's just letting something flow
through you, even if you wake

00:36:03.189 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning
before work and you

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:90%
feel like moving and dancing.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Just twirl.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Just twirl!

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Twirl, yeah.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's it.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.180 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You have life--

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.490 align:middle line:84%
you have kind of characteristic
personality types

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to energy and
how you relate to energy,

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and what you need to do
to rebalance yourself.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.405 align:middle line:84%
And I just jotted
down a few notes

00:36:23.405 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
on these, because they're
kind of simple archetypes

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:90%
that we usually fall into.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Would you say the majority
of us falls into one,

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
but we may have some
other smaller proportions

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.670 align:middle line:90%
of ourself that are in others?

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So you go with the
dominant archetype?

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So the dominant archetypes
here are the intellect,

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:84%
the empath, the rock, the
gusher, and the floater.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you care to talk
a little bit about that?

00:36:44.158 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Kind of our little news you can
use and take home right now,

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're just guidelines
to how you primarily relate

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to the world, and how others
primarily relate to the world,

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:84%
so you can better relate to
them by knowing their ways.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to honor their way,
and you have to honor your way.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people, for instance,
are primarily intellectual,

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:84%
where they like to
operate out of their head,

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:84%
they like linear thought,
they like abstract thinking,

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:90%
and they like to analyze.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is primarily the
place where they come from.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.569 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong with
that, but what I'm suggesting

00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:17.896 align:middle line:84%
is that people balance
it a little bit more.

00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they're in their
heads all the time, perhaps

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:84%
they want to be more
of an empath, which

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is the type I described before,
which is open and sensitive,

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and absorbing the
world, and taking on--

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:90%
feeling the vibes of the world.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's
an intellect, they

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:84%
might want to balance
that type with more

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:90%
of an intuitive expression.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And an empath, on
the other hand,

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:84%
who is very sensitive
and intuitive,

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual and
open, might want

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to analyze a little bit more,
have more linear thinking

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and ground themselves more
with linear activities,

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:84%
so that their intellect can
balance the empathy if it's out

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:90%
of whack.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a little
here, a little there.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the floater?

00:37:59.060 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:90%
What's a floater?

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the floater is somebody
who's not in their body.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>> One could guess.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Having been part
floater in my life,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm much more my body
than I used to be.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:84%
My tendency though
is to lift out.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:90%
During stress, I'll lift out.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.369 align:middle line:90%
I don't go in.

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:84%
People who are much more
Earth-centered than I am

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:84%
go into their bodies,
into the core.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:90%
They burrow in.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Me, I lift out.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.680 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:90%
It just depends.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So floaters need things that
are more grounding, in general.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Including food.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Food, yeah.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Chicken, fish, protein,
floaters usually can benefit

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot from that.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.435 align:middle line:90%
>> And the gusher?

00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And the gusher is
someone who just--

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.600 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything on their
mind comes out of their mouth.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
They are great at
expressing themselves,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:84%
great in knowing
what they're feeling,

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
but they get very anxious
when they can't share.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And so then what they need
to do to balance themselves

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
is to learn more
self-sufficiency

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
in going inward and asking
intuitive questions inward,

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.580 align:middle line:84%
instead of being totally
dependent on friends

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:84%
or outside forces to
make them feel better

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and relieve their anxiety
when something comes up.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The Gusher's always
on the phone.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.502 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:39:09.502 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm part gusher.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I really depend on my friends
to process things and talk,

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:90%
and I really do.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not someone to
keep something in.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good thing for me.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it, it's just
not my-- it's not my way.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But it may be good
for somebody else.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:84%
These are energetic
preferences, really.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But a gusher really
needs to balance that

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:84%
by learning self-sufficiency
and learning to go inside more

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.255 align:middle line:84%
and ask inner-- for inner
guidance for what feels right.

00:39:36.255 --> 00:39:37.055 align:middle line:90%
Not--

00:39:37.055 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Not just outer guidance.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the rock?

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the last one
we haven't touched on.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:90%
The rock.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the rock is somebody
who is very solid and there

00:39:47.105 --> 00:39:48.200 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Very earthbound, solid.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:84%
This person will always show up
if you have a birthday party,

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is always there
on your occasions.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:84%
A loyal devoted friend who
tends to listen very well,

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but does not express
themselves that well.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to be
couch potatoes, or maybe

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:84%
a little boring, or
not emotive, and out of

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:90%
touch with their passion a bit.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So to balance the other
wonderful qualities

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of the rock, you know, are
the more passionate aspects.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.990 align:middle line:84%
The rock could use
a little gusher.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The rock could use a little
sexual energy coming in,

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.730 align:middle line:84%
or movement, or
yoga, or something

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:84%
like that to balance the
good qualities of the rock.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.045 align:middle line:84%
So these are all energetic
propensities, let's say.

00:40:32.045 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Within all of
these different types,

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
it kind of leads into
your newest work.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would like to know
about the subject of "Emotional

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.747 align:middle line:84%
Freedom," and you've done
a lot of work in this area.

00:40:41.747 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Want to give us just a
little teaser on that

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.765 align:middle line:90%
before we wrap it up?

00:40:44.765 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'd be happy to.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm so passionate about
this "Emotional Freedom,"

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.720 align:middle line:84%
because what it
is is learning how

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:84%
to transform negative emotions
and not getting mired in them,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and transform them,
working with them to create

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.030 align:middle line:84%
more positive
emotions and learning

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:90%
how to balance yourself.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's really a skill.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And I go through all
the different emotions.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal
with frustration?

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with anger?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.611 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with depression?

00:41:08.611 --> 00:41:09.860 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with jealousy?

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And how do you transform it to
its positive counterpart by--

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
not by design, but by
working with the energies

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and the intuitions,
and the neurobiology

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and the psychology, and the
spirituality of emotions.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.170 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
aspects to emotions.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And once you get the
hang of it, each chapter

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:84%
is devoted to a
different emotion,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be prepared
for everything.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really important,
because it's amazing what

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.630 align:middle line:90%
the average human being--

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:84%
the percentage of
thoughts that go

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.750 align:middle line:84%
through their mind
that are negative

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:90%
versus supportive and positive.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a chronic
condition of humanity,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.280 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's why we're here.

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a very dark negative
place, along with the positive.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But once we learn how to
work with these emotions, aka

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.580 align:middle line:90%
energies--

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.310 align:middle line:84%
now they're called emotions and
energies are the same thing--

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.590 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to be
empowered to transform

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:90%
whatever comes our way.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point is
transformation, not denial.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Not trying to be too
nice, or too good,

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:84%
or too giving, but just
working with what you've got,

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
seeing where you get hooked,
and learning to transform it.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:90%
That's very powerful.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Doing it on a day by day basis.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.610 align:middle line:90%
then you could be free.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you are
bogged down by all kinds

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.720 align:middle line:84%
of negative thoughts
and feelings

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.178 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
what to do with

00:42:25.178 --> 00:42:27.140 align:middle line:90%
and they take over in your body.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And negativity, on
an intuitive level,

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.170 align:middle line:90%
has a very strong charge.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It really demands
your attention.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Whereas positive energy, and
calm, and peace, all of that,

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.770 align:middle line:84%
is not as showy and flashy
on an intuitive level.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:42.141 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't grab your attention.

00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:43.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to go after it.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
come after you.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Whereas negativity
comes after you,

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and you have to make
a decision to center

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and transform to get
to a better place.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
a heroic act that you

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.485 align:middle line:84%
could do every day, working
with this negative energy,

00:42:58.485 --> 00:43:01.200 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that on
an individual level when

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:84%
we do this it affects our lives,
and our loved ones, and also

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:84%
resonates out to
the greater world.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
secret for getting--

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.510 align:middle line:90%
not warring, not going to war.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you deal with the
personal issues inside that

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.650 align:middle line:84%
cause you to war with
yourself and cause you

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to war with others,
and you begin

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to gain some command
over that, then you're

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
not going to want to blow
somebody else up because

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of your repressed
anger from childhood.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.360 align:middle line:84%
What's the publication
date on that?

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>That's March '09.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> March '09.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I've got that down.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I want to read that one.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.150 align:middle line:90%
That just sounds--

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.041 align:middle line:84%
>> --it sounds like
a beautiful work.

00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, just to
kind of wrap it up,

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:84%
how does your family
deal with you today?

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:84%
They still don't want to-- they
don't want to still commit you

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:90%
now, do they?

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my parents are
both on the other side.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.126 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:43:53.126 --> 00:43:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they have a chance to see
how you blossomed before they

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.825 align:middle line:90%
passed over to the other side?

00:43:57.825 --> 00:44:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my father did
more than my mother.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:84%
My mother was dying when I was
writing my first book, "Second

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Sight," and she knew
I was writing the book

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and she was really
happy about it.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But she never knew the me, who
was the writer and the author,

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and the speaker.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:90%
She never knew that me.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I was-- she knew the doctor
who was in private practice,

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and you know, and hadn't
explored this sphere before.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But my father saw
this, and he used

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to come to my lectures
and sit-in the front row.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And when he was dying, he
used to ask his caregiver

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to read from my first
book, "Second Sight," which

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:90%
was the story of my life.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And she would read
from it, and he

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.220 align:middle line:84%
would be sitting there,
laying there, as he was dying,

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:84%
listening to the
words that I wrote.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:90%
It was so touching.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.405 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:44:42.405 --> 00:44:43.775 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:44:43.775 --> 00:44:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like maybe I
wrote it just for that.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe you did.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.610 align:middle line:84%
To go back and help them heal
their own belief systems,

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.410 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Or to pass over.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And to pass over.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you
so much for this.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.100 align:middle line:84%
This has just been so
helpful for so many people.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And we all look forward to
this release in March of '09.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.190 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, you have a
lot of other books out there,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're out there speaking,

So will people be able to go

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> --tune in with your work.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I look forward
to meeting everybody.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.115 align:middle line:90%
