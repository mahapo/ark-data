00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:02.566
<v ->What if you could be given a snapshot of your past</v>

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.963
and understand in an instant, your modus operandi?

3
00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:09.631
In his book Genius Mind: Activating Your Brilliance,

4
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:13.108
Paul Sheele assists us to take this single frame images

5
00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:14.168
from our past,

6
00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:16.808
and use them to move beyond our mind's filters,

7
00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.883
and connect with our own genius.

8
00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:21.151
In this interview, he is particularly passionate

9
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.201
about keeping the innate genius of our children alive.

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.238 line:15% 
(peaceful music)

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.663
I had the privilage of sitting in on your presentation

12
00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:38.502
on the subject of expanding our use of genius,

13
00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:39.986
which was just fascinating,

14
00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:42.372
and in addition to that you had some really wonderful,

15
00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:44.002
simple, playful exercises,

16
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.131
which we're going to roll into this.

17
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.411
Normally we don't do that,

18
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.202
but first of all, let's talk about your,

19
00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.449
the subject of the transformational power

20
00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:53.979
of single images,

21
00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.413
because this is something that,

22
00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:57.323
it's a concept I think, it's new to most of us.

23
00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:01.358
<v ->It's a remarkable concept when you realize</v>

24
00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:04.760
that for many years we've all been focused on the idea

25
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.706
of creating a vision of what we want in the future.

26
00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:11.890
This idea of creative visualization has been taught

27
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.936
for decades now.

28
00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:18.631
The concept that I'm bringing into the mass conciousness

29
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.202
is the work of a Dr. Ahsen,

30
00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:23.432
who was originally from Cashmere,

31
00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:26.180
came to United States in the early 60's,

32
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.818
and he's been working on this idea of eidetics

33
00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.920
since the 1950's.

34
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.621
The eidetic is the image or the idea

35
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:37.426
that's coming into form,

36
00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:39.364
it's an ancient Greek term.

37
00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:44.093
Our word for idea was the Greek term iden,

38
00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:48.187
and the ides were the messengers of the gods,

39
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.835
these messages of the gods is what we're here to receive.

40
00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:56.451
In the Aboriginal cultures they talk about the dreaming.

41
00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:59.914
That there is a reality that exists,

42
00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:04.219
that has a life, it's fixed in the world already,

43
00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.745
and mankind is attracted to those areas where

44
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.896
the dreaming is calling them to it,

45
00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.991
so for example, in Australia,

46
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.202
somebody said, wow, look at where that beautiful city is,

47
00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.433
that people have built here,

48
00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:21.801
and the Aborigine, Aboriginal Chiefs they say,

49
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:26.309
"Yeah, the dreaming has been in that place forever.

50
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.110
"Through all of the millennium."

51
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.977
And the men, the white men, think

52
00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:32.582
that what they've done is they've built this great thing,

53
00:02:32.582 --> 00:02:35.374
they've only just responded to the dream

54
00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:37.417
that's called them to build there.

55
00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:41.646
And so, an appreciation of an idea

56
00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:44.395
that is already pre-existant within us,

57
00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:45.986
or think of it this way,

58
00:02:45.986 --> 00:02:48.462
that the presence and power

59
00:02:48.462 --> 00:02:52.554
of a higher consciousness is trying to express itself

60
00:02:53.324 --> 00:02:55.274
through our lives.

61
00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.337
If you think about the sun and the rays

62
00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:58.472
coming out of the sun,

63
00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:01.375
we are emanations of that one source.

64
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:04.136
We're not here trying to have a spiritual experience,

65
00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:05.744
we're not the rays of the sun

66
00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:07.181
trying to get back to the sun,

67
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.078
we are the emanation, we are the expression,

68
00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:12.591
and so if we would go within ourselves,

69
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.090
and be still or be quiet,

70
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.662
and allow that idea to come forward,

71
00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:20.490
that's the eidetic,

72
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.564
and there are certain eidetics, certain images,

73
00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:26.506
that are actually very fixed within us,

74
00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:30.468
and if we would contact them and then watch

75
00:03:30.468 --> 00:03:33.244
where the eidetic takes us,

76
00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:35.844
in other words, be open to the idea,

77
00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:38.149
and then watch the idea and follow it

78
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.539
instead of forcing the world

79
00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.114
to be what we want it to be,

80
00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.984
allow it to unfold and allow it to express.

81
00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:45.805
<v Voiceover>And that is what the Western world does,</v>

82
00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:47.089
we take our analytical mind

83
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.457
and we try to conjure or construct an outcome.

84
00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:53.065
Or whatever that reality may be.

85
00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.294
<v ->Right and if we see that we're really,</v>

86
00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:58.367
we're really fulfilling a higher purpose,

87
00:03:58.367 --> 00:04:01.637
then our lives become more meaningful as well.

88
00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:03.940
See, the idea that's happening today,

89
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.811
and this is brought about in a

90
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.876
program called the Pachamama Alliance.

91
00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:16.663
The Achuar Indians in Central America, Ecuador,

92
00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:21.222
are the native custodians of the natural world.

93
00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:23.925
They're the custodians of the rain forest.

94
00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.331
And it seems that Mother Earth

95
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.448
communicates through the rain forest,

96
00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:30.598
then the rain forest communicates to the Achuar

97
00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:32.657
in the dream world.

98
00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:35.031
And the Achuar are a dream culture,

99
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:37.062
and they went into the dream world

100
00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:39.174
to contact the modern world.

101
00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:42.141
Not to become inculturated into the modern world,

102
00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:45.579
but to help the modern world awaken.

103
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:47.214
In their cosmology,

104
00:04:47.214 --> 00:04:50.918
they believe we are living in 500 year cycles.

105
00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:53.187
There's 12, 500 year cycles.

106
00:04:53.187 --> 00:04:57.042
The last 500 year cycle just ended.

107
00:04:57.042 --> 00:04:59.524
And it was predicted millennia ago

108
00:04:59.524 --> 00:05:03.189
to be a time of discovery and destruction.

109
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.698
And it started in 1492.

110
00:05:05.698 --> 00:05:06.934
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

111
00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:10.598
<v ->Now, we've just passed out of that 500 year cycle,</v>

112
00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:13.278
and this next 500 year cycle

113
00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:16.777
is the time in which the condor and the eagle

114
00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:19.807
will fly together in the same sky.

115
00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:23.457
Now, in this, in this mythology of theirs,

116
00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:26.815
the eagle is a people who live in their minds.

117
00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:31.526
They're a people who have high technology

118
00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:33.629
but they're stuck in a dream

119
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.298
and as a result of their dream,

120
00:05:35.298 --> 00:05:37.595
they're destroying the natural world.

121
00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:40.836
The condor are the people who are the natural custodians

122
00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:42.200
of the world,

123
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.403
and what they need to do is

124
00:05:43.403 --> 00:05:45.910
they need to help awaken the dreamer

125
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.803
and change the dream.

126
00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:49.970
And so the Pachamama Alliance,

127
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.075
Lynne Twist, who was the director of the Hunger Project

128
00:05:54.075 --> 00:05:55.442
for many years,

129
00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:57.750
wrote a book called the Soul of Money.

130
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.115
She was contacted in the dream world,

131
00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:03.790
found the Achuar Indians, traveled to the rain forest,

132
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.753
and now they've created this alliance

133
00:06:06.753 --> 00:06:10.798
to help do this, to help awaken humanity.

134
00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:12.398
You know, if you think about the eagle,

135
00:06:12.398 --> 00:06:15.101
well what people could be high technology people,

136
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:17.767
with eagle in their national symbols alright?

137
00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:18.239
<v Voiceover>Hello?</v>

138
00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:19.341
<v ->The Germans, the US, you know.</v>

139
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.805
<v Voiceover>The US, that's exactly what I was thinking.</v>

140
00:06:21.805 --> 00:06:23.842
<v ->And so the idea is,</v>

141
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:27.047
that we're, as a culture,

142
00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:29.642
we're trapped in a nightmare believing that

143
00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:32.089
the natural world is going to fulfill an emptiness

144
00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:33.648
that's within us.

145
00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.383
And so what we do is,

146
00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:37.889
we rape and destroy the natural world

147
00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.419
to try to consume it,

148
00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.293
to try to fill that emptiness,

149
00:06:41.293 --> 00:06:42.434
but what happens?

150
00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:43.929
We get to the end and we realize

151
00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:46.197
that the emptiness is still there.

152
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.007
In my work, when I was 19 years old,

153
00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:52.167
I was actually trained as a professional hypnotist.

154
00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:54.659
And one of the things that I recognize

155
00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.982
is that my job wasn't to place people into trances,

156
00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:01.550
because I realize so many people already are in trances,

157
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.690
but they're self limiting and they're self defeating.

158
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.626
What I realized I had to do

159
00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:09.854
was awaken people from their self limiting trances

160
00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:13.287
to awaken them to realize the full magnificence

161
00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:15.020
of who they are.

162
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.967
And if you go to the tradition of

163
00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:20.028
the Himalayan yoga meditations,

164
00:07:21.218 --> 00:07:23.674
you realize that their philosophy is,

165
00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:25.640
there's only one suffering.

166
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.348
And humanity, the only suffering that humanity has,

167
00:07:30.348 --> 00:07:32.609
is a result of ignorance.

168
00:07:32.609 --> 00:07:36.199
It's ignorance of their divine nature.

169
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.286
So you see, when we awaken to who we are,

170
00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:42.594
as spiritual beings here to have this human experience,

171
00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:45.557
we recognize that we're connected to the natural world,

172
00:07:45.557 --> 00:07:47.995
we can't destroy the natural world,

173
00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:51.424
in order to fulfill an emptiness we feel,

174
00:07:51.424 --> 00:07:54.839
we have to be able to live in harmony and balance with that.

175
00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.165
And so this concept of awakening from the trance,

176
00:07:58.165 --> 00:07:59.628
awakening from the nightmare,

177
00:07:59.628 --> 00:08:02.915
awakening the dreamer and changing the dream,

178
00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.479
if we think about what is the real dream,

179
00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.879
the dream is our divine nature attempting to express itself

180
00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:12.128
through our lives.

181
00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:16.823
And the eidetic, that true eidetic image,

182
00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:20.628
that pure idea from the realm of pure imagination

183
00:08:20.628 --> 00:08:23.283
from which we sprung,

184
00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.996
if we would make contact with that

185
00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:27.661
and then follow it,

186
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:30.519
we would have fulfillment in our lives.

187
00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:34.340
What happened is as we were born into the world,

188
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.182
we began interacting with the history of the world.

189
00:08:38.182 --> 00:08:39.680
The history of our parents,

190
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.849
the history of our culture and our religion,

191
00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.279
and we have to try to find our way through it,

192
00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:48.488
and it's separated our mind from our experience,

193
00:08:48.488 --> 00:08:50.860
our body and mind became separated,

194
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.391
and that, that separation is what we call

195
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:55.805
psychosematic illness.

196
00:08:56.164 --> 00:09:00.335
And if we look at what we're understanding about

197
00:09:00.335 --> 00:09:02.266
complementary and alternative medicine,

198
00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:03.698
we recognize that the source

199
00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:06.570
of virtually 100% of all illness,

200
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.708
is in the mind.

201
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:11.377
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

202
00:09:11.377 --> 00:09:15.187
<v ->Etiology, the causation, is at the mind first.</v>

203
00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:17.319
So if we could heal ourselves,

204
00:09:17.319 --> 00:09:20.580
if we could restore the psyche and the soma,

205
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.454
then what we have is this opportunity to live

206
00:09:23.454 --> 00:09:24.324
at our fullness.

207
00:09:24.324 --> 00:09:26.557
And so story is of working with Dr. Ahsen,

208
00:09:26.557 --> 00:09:29.162
the stories of paralysis disappearing,

209
00:09:29.162 --> 00:09:33.134
muscular sclerosis disappearing,

210
00:09:33.134 --> 00:09:36.808
all kinds of mental illnesses completely evaporating,

211
00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:39.865
it's a result of the work of this,

212
00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:44.776
concept of the eidetic and recontacting the realm

213
00:09:44.776 --> 00:09:47.060
of pure imagination,

214
00:09:47.849 --> 00:09:49.440
which is really where we come from.

215
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.590
<v Voiceover>So does that mean deconstructing</v>

216
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.384
what we have, essentially, learned

217
00:09:54.384 --> 00:09:56.053
since birth?

218
00:09:56.733 --> 00:09:58.821
<v ->I like the way you say that, deconstructing.</v>

219
00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:01.099
If we could understand the construction

220
00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:03.687
of our thoughts, of our memories,

221
00:10:04.627 --> 00:10:07.336
and realize that what we're doing constantly,

222
00:10:07.336 --> 00:10:10.628
is we're reconstructing an original experience.

223
00:10:10.628 --> 00:10:14.011
And if our original experience

224
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.606
was a distortion, a deletion, a generalization

225
00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:20.271
of what was really going on,

226
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:23.589
then what we have is a problem inside of us.

227
00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.121
That idea that we keep reconstructing

228
00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:28.273
is not an idea of our wholeness,

229
00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:32.456
it's an idea of our dysfunction, of our woundedness,

230
00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:33.495
of our brokenness,

231
00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:35.482
so think about this.

232
00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:39.224
The human mind, when it remembers anything,

233
00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:43.721
we can guide our reviewers to have this experience,

234
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:45.526
this is really kind of fun.

235
00:10:45.526 --> 00:10:46.671
<v Voiceover>Okay, now hold on, sit in a nice,</v>

236
00:10:46.671 --> 00:10:49.434
quiet position, and get ready for a little exercise, too.

237
00:10:49.434 --> 00:10:51.507
<v ->This is to help understand</v>

238
00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:54.953
that all memory is reconstructing

239
00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:57.452
of an original construction.

240
00:10:57.452 --> 00:11:00.214
Now, again, the point of this is,

241
00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:02.937
the human mind naturally deletes, distorts,

242
00:11:02.937 --> 00:11:03.883
and generalizes,

243
00:11:03.883 --> 00:11:05.497
because we wanna understand the world,

244
00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:07.284
and we wanna understand it quickly,

245
00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:09.656
but as a result of that speed,

246
00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:11.997
we actually lose some of the clarity

247
00:11:11.997 --> 00:11:15.762
and the objectivity of the truth of what was really

248
00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:17.628
there for us at the time.

249
00:11:17.628 --> 00:11:19.297
We have a meaning and then we try to

250
00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:22.073
create our understanding of that, you see.

251
00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:23.539
<v Voiceover>I think most people can relate to that,</v>

252
00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:25.042
when they start looking back on their lives,

253
00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:26.740
it's a massive distortion.

254
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.752
<v ->Exactly, most of what we recall</v>

255
00:11:28.752 --> 00:11:31.246
is highly distorted, so,

256
00:11:31.246 --> 00:11:33.524
what I'd like to share with everybody is

257
00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:37.252
this idea of how the mind remembers something.

258
00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:40.259
Because memory happens,

259
00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:43.163
the remembering of something happens 400

260
00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:46.679
to 2,000 times faster than we can consciously

261
00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:48.964
see it happening,

262
00:11:48.964 --> 00:11:52.839
we don't realize that what's happening is reconstruction.

263
00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:54.432
So I'm gonna give you an exercise.

264
00:11:54.432 --> 00:11:55.335
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

265
00:11:55.335 --> 00:11:56.834
<v ->When I say now, you have to do this,</v>

266
00:11:56.834 --> 00:11:58.502
as fast as you can.

267
00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:00.440
<v Voiceover>Are you speaking to me or everybody else</v>

268
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.020
or all of us?

269
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.813
<v ->Everybody that's listening.</v>

270
00:12:01.813 --> 00:12:02.947
But I'm gonna force you to do it.

271
00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:04.588
(laughing)

272
00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:05.618
<v Voiceover>Alright.</v>

273
00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:07.351
<v ->Okay, so as fast as you can,</v>

274
00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:09.047
and everybody does it at the same time,

275
00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:10.546
if there's somebody sitting next to you,

276
00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:11.717
you can do it with them,

277
00:12:11.717 --> 00:12:13.462
you know, talk as fast as you can

278
00:12:13.462 --> 00:12:14.492
and as loud as you can,

279
00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:16.795
just try to do the exercise as quickly as possible.

280
00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:18.334
<v Voiceover>Okay, we're all together on this one.</v>

281
00:12:18.334 --> 00:12:20.032
<v ->Okay, so first part, it's a three part exercise,</v>

282
00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:23.432
first part is say the months of the year in order now.

283
00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:25.010
<v Voiceover>January, February, March, April,</v>

284
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.863
May, June, July, August,

285
00:12:25.863 --> 00:12:27.772
September, October, November, December.

286
00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:29.034
<v ->Bingo.</v>

287
00:12:29.034 --> 00:12:29.610
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

288
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.111
We know that my mind has that construct, okay.

289
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.579
<v ->So that's in there, that's how we remember it.</v>

290
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:36.185
It comes very quickly.

291
00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:38.475
You don't really see the mind remembering it.

292
00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:39.849
It just happens.

293
00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:41.454
So now, what you're going to do,

294
00:12:41.454 --> 00:12:43.925
the second part of the exercise,

295
00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:46.618
months of the year, reverse order,

296
00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:48.428
starting with July, now.

297
00:12:48.428 --> 00:12:50.428
<v Voiceover>July, June, May, April,</v>

298
00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:53.563
March, February, January, December,

299
00:12:53.563 --> 00:12:56.103
November, October, September,

300
00:12:56.696 --> 00:12:58.944
August, and I think we're there.

301
00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.101
<v ->Excellent.</v>

302
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:03.281
So, you know, I could see your eyeballs move.

303
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:05.012
<v Voiceover>Having to really try to track</v>

304
00:13:05.012 --> 00:13:05.837
that information.

305
00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:09.755
<v ->Exactly, what you did, your eyes went up to the left</v>

306
00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.312
and if you study neurolinguistic programming,

307
00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:14.453
what that says is, you're trying to remember

308
00:13:14.453 --> 00:13:15.243
the visual picture,

309
00:13:15.243 --> 00:13:16.153
and that's exactly right.

310
00:13:16.153 --> 00:13:18.523
You have the calendar of the year

311
00:13:18.523 --> 00:13:21.130
there in front of you and you're trying to see it

312
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.391
and you're trying, okay, now (stammering),

313
00:13:23.391 --> 00:13:24.599
so this is reverse order, July--

314
00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:25.828
<v Voiceover>It's not natural, right.</v>

315
00:13:25.828 --> 00:13:29.493
<v ->Yeah, so you're actually starting to see your mind</v>

316
00:13:30.313 --> 00:13:32.029
reconstruct something.

317
00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:32.731
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

318
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:34.874
<v ->And that's actually what's happening all the time,</v>

319
00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:35.867
now we're gonna do the third part

320
00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:36.544
of the exercise.

321
00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:37.077
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

322
00:13:37.077 --> 00:13:39.283
<v ->Now you're really gonna get to see your mind</v>

323
00:13:39.283 --> 00:13:42.555
reconstructing (laughing).

324
00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.648
Okay, months of the year,

325
00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:46.722
alphabetical order, now.

326
00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:51.443
<v Voiceover>April, August, December,</v>

327
00:13:52.054 --> 00:13:53.580
February.

328
00:13:54.297 --> 00:13:56.061
February, March, April, May (laughing),

329
00:13:56.061 --> 00:13:57.902
okay, I know I can do this,

330
00:13:57.902 --> 00:14:00.195
M, m, m, m, m, is there anything before March?

331
00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:01.037
March --

332
00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:02.496
<v ->Well, there are a few other J's.</v>

333
00:14:02.496 --> 00:14:03.473
<v Voiceover>Oh, J's.</v>

334
00:14:03.473 --> 00:14:06.905
Oh there are January, July, and June.

335
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.588
Yeah, right?

336
00:14:08.588 --> 00:14:08.910
<v ->Excellent.</v>

337
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Voiceover>And then there's March.</v>

338
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.068
<v ->Okay, well we'll stop you there.</v>

339
00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:11.735
(laughing)

340
00:14:11.735 --> 00:14:12.707
<v Voiceover>You're torturing me.</v>

341
00:14:12.707 --> 00:14:13.749
That's hard.

342
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:15.752
<v ->It's hard, but you see what's happening,</v>

343
00:14:15.752 --> 00:14:17.883
is you've got alphabeticity, you know,

344
00:14:17.883 --> 00:14:19.021
what is the alphabetical order,

345
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:20.416
so there's A, there's B, there's C,

346
00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:21.113
and there's D.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

347
00:14:21.113 --> 00:14:22.859
<v ->And then there's the months of the year,</v>

348
00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:24.720
now you're trying to build that,

349
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.498
well that's exactly what the mind does

350
00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:29.599
when it tries to remember anything.

351
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:31.269
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

352
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:34.503
<v ->It takes these bits of information,</v>

353
00:14:34.503 --> 00:14:36.337
and according to research, it's not just

354
00:14:36.337 --> 00:14:37.129
from within the brain,

355
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:40.376
it's non-local and it converges in the brain

356
00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:41.778
in a certain area.

357
00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:43.678
They actually call it, researchers call this

358
00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:46.210
a convergence zone,

359
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.515
and we have different convergence zones

360
00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:50.518
for episodic memories, you know,

361
00:14:50.518 --> 00:14:52.188
episodes that have occurred in your life

362
00:14:52.188 --> 00:14:53.721
or semantic memories,

363
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.255
you know, words and thoughts and ideas

364
00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:56.574
and things like that.

365
00:14:56.574 --> 00:14:58.792
So, the point of all this,

366
00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:01.286
is when you're living your life,

367
00:15:01.286 --> 00:15:03.098
today you're referencing your history,

368
00:15:03.098 --> 00:15:05.795
you're reconstructing things,

369
00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:08.135
and if your original construction

370
00:15:08.135 --> 00:15:09.992
was a poor one,

371
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:13.927
then what you get later on is a poor reconstruction.

372
00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:18.712
Just as an aside, if anybody says I got a lousy memory,

373
00:15:18.712 --> 00:15:23.612
stop it, because everybody has less than a perfect memory,

374
00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:26.090
memory isn't a perfect thing,

375
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.416
but if there's a gap in trying to remember something,

376
00:15:28.416 --> 00:15:31.787
you can be sure that that gap is the result of

377
00:15:33.177 --> 00:15:36.530
a poor construction, original construction,

378
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.665
so the attempt to reconstruct it isn't coming together.

379
00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:42.372
What you need to do is what we call

380
00:15:42.372 --> 00:15:44.669
intelligent gap management.

381
00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:45.942
Manage the gap.

382
00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:48.065
Just don't claim you're a lousy,

383
00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:49.579
you know, you've got a lousy memory,

384
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:52.173
because that affirmation then works,

385
00:15:52.173 --> 00:15:53.244
you won't try.

386
00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:53.784
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

387
00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:54.514
<v ->Oh I've got a lousy memory,</v>

388
00:15:54.514 --> 00:15:55.446
I'll never remember that.

389
00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:56.321
And you don't even bother.

390
00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:57.149
<v Voiceover>And you check out, right.</v>

391
00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:57.986
<v ->You check out completely.</v>

392
00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:00.785
So that's an aside, just a side bar,

393
00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:02.757
and the point that I'm making about this

394
00:16:02.757 --> 00:16:05.519
is there's certain images within us,

395
00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:07.864
that are stored in our memory

396
00:16:07.864 --> 00:16:09.066
and we'll go through a couple of these

397
00:16:09.066 --> 00:16:10.366
and it's just to give people

398
00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:12.069
an experience of this

399
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:15.914
and those memories are actually fixed.

400
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:18.740
And as a result of those fixed memories

401
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.567
if they're significant distortions and they interrupt,

402
00:16:22.567 --> 00:16:24.272
the psyche and the soma,

403
00:16:24.272 --> 00:16:26.083
the mind and the body,

404
00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:27.236
then what we can do is

405
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.844
we can actually go back and

406
00:16:29.844 --> 00:16:33.478
reconstruct or play a negative memory

407
00:16:33.478 --> 00:16:36.505
and a positive memory next to each other.

408
00:16:36.924 --> 00:16:38.390
And by doing this over and over again,

409
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.262
and then reconstructing over and over again

410
00:16:40.262 --> 00:16:41.592
a positive memory,

411
00:16:41.592 --> 00:16:44.100
we actually override the negative memory.

412
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.128
Negative memory never really goes away.

413
00:16:47.128 --> 00:16:51.562
But by sorting for more images of greater

414
00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:54.807
wholeism, greater fulfillment,

415
00:16:54.807 --> 00:16:57.602
greater capacity, you begin to gain

416
00:16:57.602 --> 00:17:01.798
more access to the true resources that are within you.

417
00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:03.547
Remember I told you that

418
00:17:03.547 --> 00:17:06.819
I originally grew up in the field of hypnosis,

419
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.861
I was 19 years old, trained as a professional hypnotist,

420
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:11.361
well that gave me a window

421
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:14.733
into people's minds that was an amazing opportunity

422
00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:16.226
as a young man,

423
00:17:16.226 --> 00:17:18.737
and then studying neurolinguistic programming,

424
00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:21.501
I was one of the first few ever certified and credentialed

425
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:23.403
as a master practitioner,

426
00:17:23.403 --> 00:17:25.335
there are only 70 of us in the world

427
00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:27.104
when we are certified,

428
00:17:27.104 --> 00:17:29.380
and so I'm certifiable now,

429
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.194
so the idea is that this gave me an opportunity

430
00:17:34.194 --> 00:17:39.022
to see how the human mind is actually causing

431
00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:43.378
so much of the malaise that people live.

432
00:17:43.378 --> 00:17:45.760
So as a human development professional,

433
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.424
what I was always working with,

434
00:17:47.424 --> 00:17:50.914
is to help people contact the true resources within them.

435
00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:53.029
But more importantly, I see that

436
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:54.895
what we need to do is awaken from

437
00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:57.294
the trances that we've been living in.

438
00:17:57.294 --> 00:18:00.076
Recognize the magnificence of who we are

439
00:18:00.076 --> 00:18:02.444
and then start living from that.

440
00:18:02.444 --> 00:18:04.649
Well, when you get right down to it,

441
00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:07.210
that magnificence is attempting to be

442
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.719
communicated to us.

443
00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:09.844
And what we need to do is

444
00:18:09.844 --> 00:18:11.815
we need to go inside,

445
00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:14.112
be quiet enough to see where our mind

446
00:18:14.112 --> 00:18:15.360
is trying to lead us.

447
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.261
Emerson said find your soul and poke it with a stick

448
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:22.364
and see which way it moves and then follow it.

449
00:18:22.364 --> 00:18:24.097
<v Voiceover>Interesting, that's nicely put.</v>

450
00:18:24.097 --> 00:18:26.295
<v ->Yeah, and really I think that's what the science</v>

451
00:18:26.295 --> 00:18:29.152
of eidetics really gives us the opportunity

452
00:18:29.152 --> 00:18:29.938
to create.

453
00:18:29.938 --> 00:18:32.539
<v Voiceover>But instead, what we tend to do</v>

454
00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:35.844
is pull out the laundry list or the wish list,

455
00:18:35.844 --> 00:18:38.175
of how we want to construct our lives

456
00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:41.647
and if we have this meditation time available to us,

457
00:18:41.647 --> 00:18:43.817
a lot of people spend a lot of that time

458
00:18:43.817 --> 00:18:45.922
basically wishing, hoping, thinking,

459
00:18:45.922 --> 00:18:48.456
and trying to create or construct a new reality

460
00:18:48.456 --> 00:18:50.595
or better reality for themselves.

461
00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:52.528
Rather than, what you say,

462
00:18:52.528 --> 00:18:55.583
standing back and allowing the knowledge,

463
00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:58.235
the truth, the direction to surface.

464
00:18:58.235 --> 00:19:00.389
<v ->Right, and I also believe</v>

465
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:02.767
that it doesn't have to be an either or.

466
00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.774
So, for example, think of it this way,

467
00:19:05.614 --> 00:19:09.288
I have an idea of the life I would choose to live.

468
00:19:09.614 --> 00:19:14.280
A life of fulfillment, of success, of health,

469
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.582
of happiness, of spiritual growth,

470
00:19:16.582 --> 00:19:19.351
so if I think of those four areas

471
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:23.014
of my life, success, health,

472
00:19:23.014 --> 00:19:25.730
relationships, and spiritual growth,

473
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.821
and I think well, what is the life

474
00:19:27.821 --> 00:19:29.164
that I would choose to live?

475
00:19:29.164 --> 00:19:30.128
If it's three years from now,

476
00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.917
five years, seven years from now,

477
00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:34.532
what would my life experience be

478
00:19:34.532 --> 00:19:36.029
what I would choose?

479
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.164
If I'm quiet enough,

480
00:19:39.064 --> 00:19:42.542
then the thoughts and ideas that come to me

481
00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:45.573
occur to me because that's what is

482
00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:48.690
attempting to express in my life.

483
00:19:49.844 --> 00:19:52.791
So instead of forcing my mind

484
00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:56.056
to create a specific end result,

485
00:19:56.056 --> 00:19:58.690
particular year and make and model of a car

486
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.450
and leather interior and all that,

487
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.525
say that what I am choosing to create

488
00:20:02.525 --> 00:20:05.459
is the ideal transportation for me.

489
00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:09.267
And then be open, give that to my mind,

490
00:20:09.267 --> 00:20:11.301
and then be quiet,

491
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:13.636
and allow that intuitive sense,

492
00:20:13.636 --> 00:20:16.339
that realm of pure imagination,

493
00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:19.874
to then come up and say and Paul,

494
00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:22.372
here's how it can occur,

495
00:20:22.372 --> 00:20:24.479
try this, make this phone call,

496
00:20:24.479 --> 00:20:26.223
talk to that person,

497
00:20:26.223 --> 00:20:29.046
look into this particular type of vehicle,

498
00:20:29.046 --> 00:20:31.193
consider no vehicle at all.

499
00:20:31.193 --> 00:20:33.294
Try riding your bike instead,

500
00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:34.724
you need the exercise anyway,

501
00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:37.693
and so it's the idea, instead of driving,

502
00:20:37.693 --> 00:20:41.605
driving, driving, try pushing to get from the universe

503
00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:43.367
what I think I ought to have,

504
00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:47.095
be open, say what the ideal is I would choose to live,

505
00:20:47.095 --> 00:20:49.412
and then be open and let that intuitive side

506
00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:50.609
to express.

507
00:20:50.609 --> 00:20:54.681
To me, that's where that higher intelligence

508
00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:56.881
has the opportunity to guide.

509
00:20:56.881 --> 00:21:00.693
In other words, my job is to come up with what,

510
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:03.615
let the universe come up with the how,

511
00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:05.923
and in that coming up with the how,

512
00:21:05.923 --> 00:21:09.481
it's going to show me something greater.

513
00:21:09.964 --> 00:21:12.227
It's going to show me pathways that I might not

514
00:21:12.227 --> 00:21:14.866
have considered in my conscious, rational mind.

515
00:21:14.866 --> 00:21:15.629
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

516
00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:18.065
But this requires trust

517
00:21:18.065 --> 00:21:21.806
and patience and certainly many,

518
00:21:21.806 --> 00:21:23.306
many of us watching this,

519
00:21:23.306 --> 00:21:26.260
are in a world where goals and time

520
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.815
have been paramount,

521
00:21:27.815 --> 00:21:30.152
so you're now removing those factors

522
00:21:30.152 --> 00:21:33.084
to an extent and how do you teach a person,

523
00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:35.561
or how do you encourage a person

524
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.944
to know that it's okay to relax,

525
00:21:37.944 --> 00:21:41.361
to trust, to be patient with the outcomes?

526
00:21:41.361 --> 00:21:44.299
<v ->One of the great ways that I've heard</v>

527
00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:45.270
through the years,

528
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.761
which I've always added in any visualization,

529
00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:50.135
or any goal establishment that I would have,

530
00:21:50.135 --> 00:21:53.362
is I'd always add this or something even better.

531
00:21:54.072 --> 00:21:54.808
<v Voiceover>That's a good one.</v>

532
00:21:54.808 --> 00:21:57.539
<v ->So I'm open to allowing something greater to emerge</v>

533
00:21:57.539 --> 00:22:00.410
that I may not be able to see right now.

534
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.377
Another thing is to consider,

535
00:22:02.377 --> 00:22:04.714
Ellen Langers work on mindfulness.

536
00:22:04.714 --> 00:22:06.183
She says one of the worst things

537
00:22:06.183 --> 00:22:08.218
that we can do for our minds

538
00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:10.844
is to have an outcome.

539
00:22:10.844 --> 00:22:14.830
Is to specify an end result that we must get to.

540
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.334
And this speaks to something about education as well,

541
00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:18.465
if we can talk about that.

542
00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:19.637
<v Voiceover>Oh, I can't wait to go there.</v>

543
00:22:19.637 --> 00:22:21.397
<v ->James Ogilvy wrote a book called</v>

544
00:22:21.397 --> 00:22:23.473
Living Without A Goal.

545
00:22:23.473 --> 00:22:26.241
It's an intriguing idea where so many

546
00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:27.809
self-improvement experts are saying

547
00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:29.572
set a goal, set a goal, set an outcome--

548
00:22:29.572 --> 00:22:30.571
<v Voiceover>Well, the movie The Secret</v>

549
00:22:30.571 --> 00:22:31.538
has been tearing through,

550
00:22:31.538 --> 00:22:33.242
it's on the, it's at the check out stand

551
00:22:33.242 --> 00:22:34.643
of all the big book sellers.

552
00:22:34.643 --> 00:22:37.809
<v ->Yeah, and it's a brilliant idea of,</v>

553
00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:40.258
you know, we really need to ask for what it is

554
00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:41.616
that we want,

555
00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:44.720
and it's an important concept in The Secret,

556
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.793
and it says ask, receive, believe, you know,

557
00:22:47.793 --> 00:22:51.495
the idea of be really open to receiving

558
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:54.471
and believe that the universe has the opportunity

559
00:22:54.471 --> 00:22:58.094
it has the capacity to bring us to any of that,

560
00:22:58.094 --> 00:23:01.277
when we are willing to not establish the form

561
00:23:01.277 --> 00:23:03.177
in which it arrives,

562
00:23:03.177 --> 00:23:04.878
then we're open to something greater

563
00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:07.114
that can manifest itself,

564
00:23:07.114 --> 00:23:09.371
but when we get our hands around the throat

565
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:10.977
of the universe and says now,

566
00:23:10.977 --> 00:23:13.911
bring me exactly what I want or else,

567
00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:16.456
you know, then we're not living in harmony

568
00:23:16.456 --> 00:23:19.223
with our own part, the fullness of who we are,

569
00:23:19.223 --> 00:23:22.334
we're saying I have a lack, I have a need,

570
00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.331
now if I put that into the universe,

571
00:23:24.331 --> 00:23:26.860
the universe says yes to that.

572
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.470
So here's the way I've heard it,

573
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.305
is if you want to change the type of home you live in,

574
00:23:33.305 --> 00:23:36.034
somebody asks you, well, what kind of home do you want?

575
00:23:36.034 --> 00:23:39.715
You say, you describe the home you're living in today.

576
00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:42.452
And they say, well, wait, that's the home

577
00:23:42.452 --> 00:23:43.381
you're now living in.

578
00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:44.954
He says yeah, that's what I want.

579
00:23:44.954 --> 00:23:47.388
Now I'm also choosing to create something else,

580
00:23:47.388 --> 00:23:49.247
and here's what I'm going to choose to create.

581
00:23:49.247 --> 00:23:51.422
But I always want what I have,

582
00:23:51.422 --> 00:23:52.864
that way there's a sense--

583
00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:54.016
<v Voiceover>Mmm, now that's an important ingredient.</v>

584
00:23:54.016 --> 00:23:55.794
<v ->You see, because think energetically,</v>

585
00:23:55.794 --> 00:23:58.634
here we are at our current level,

586
00:23:58.634 --> 00:24:00.730
and if I say I want something,

587
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.893
I'm jumping into an energetic hole,

588
00:24:02.893 --> 00:24:04.828
and saying I'm in a place of lack,

589
00:24:04.828 --> 00:24:06.170
or limitation,

590
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.637
now I gotta crawl out of the hole

591
00:24:07.637 --> 00:24:10.210
to get to here to now create my life.

592
00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.121
Well, if I say I want what I have

593
00:24:13.121 --> 00:24:17.384
and appreciate it as my magnificent creation,

594
00:24:17.764 --> 00:24:19.443
I appreciate my illness,

595
00:24:19.443 --> 00:24:21.815
I appreciate my spouse that I'm arguing with,

596
00:24:21.815 --> 00:24:24.291
I appreciate my kids that I can't get along with,

597
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:27.089
and instead of focusing on what I don't like,

598
00:24:27.089 --> 00:24:29.396
I really focus on what I really love,

599
00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:31.129
by the way, I love my family.

600
00:24:31.569 --> 00:24:33.569
That was for anybody else that doesn't love their spouse

601
00:24:33.569 --> 00:24:35.132
or kids, you know,

602
00:24:35.132 --> 00:24:37.607
but it's always about appreciating.

603
00:24:38.257 --> 00:24:40.897
And the word appreciate is important, too,

604
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:42.472
because in a certain way,

605
00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:46.114
when you think about our income as appreciating in value,

606
00:24:46.114 --> 00:24:48.073
it's actually an increase.

607
00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:50.678
So what we appreciate increases.

608
00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:52.613
<v Voiceover>Yes, and that's where the whole gratitude--</v>

609
00:24:52.613 --> 00:24:54.312
<v ->Gratitude is so important,</v>

610
00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:56.155
that comes through in The Secret, I think,

611
00:24:56.155 --> 00:24:57.091
in a powerful way.

612
00:24:57.091 --> 00:24:57.654
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

613
00:24:57.654 --> 00:24:59.351
<v ->Many people watch The Secret,</v>

614
00:24:59.351 --> 00:25:02.132
they immediately say, well, its unrealistic,

615
00:25:02.132 --> 00:25:03.532
and it's all about money,

616
00:25:03.532 --> 00:25:04.330
it's really not.

617
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.104
Rhonda Burns, Rhonda Burn came to

618
00:25:07.104 --> 00:25:09.163
the Transformational Leadership Council

619
00:25:09.163 --> 00:25:12.005
to film most of the people that are part of it.

620
00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:14.406
I was actually filmed for The Secret as well,

621
00:25:14.406 --> 00:25:16.577
I didn't make the final cut.

622
00:25:16.577 --> 00:25:17.704
<v Voiceover>Oh darn.</v>

623
00:25:17.704 --> 00:25:19.841
You would have been so fabulous, too.

624
00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:23.068
<v ->You're very kind, but the idea is that,</v>

625
00:25:23.068 --> 00:25:27.453
the thing that people are criticizing about it,

626
00:25:28.143 --> 00:25:29.616
is understandable because something

627
00:25:29.616 --> 00:25:31.019
which has been on the periphery

628
00:25:31.019 --> 00:25:33.894
and kind of off the radar of the mass consciousness,

629
00:25:33.894 --> 00:25:35.825
those of us who are into new thought

630
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:38.321
and into the idea of self development,

631
00:25:38.321 --> 00:25:39.759
understood these principles,

632
00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:42.440
well suddenly now, it's in the public eye,

633
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.234
it's in the spotlight.

634
00:25:44.234 --> 00:25:47.404
And you know, here's all of this amazing attentions.

635
00:25:47.404 --> 00:25:49.429
What are people gonna focus on?

636
00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:51.112
The things that's wrong with The Secret,

637
00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:52.871
you know they're going to end up criticizing

638
00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:54.907
rather than appreciating the, you know,

639
00:25:54.907 --> 00:25:56.480
the purity of the intention.

640
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.420
<v Voiceover>We have a critical culture.</v>

641
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:57.947
<v ->Yes.</v>

642
00:25:57.947 --> 00:25:59.385
And the beauty of it,

643
00:25:59.385 --> 00:26:01.347
one of the things that Jack Hanfield said

644
00:26:01.347 --> 00:26:03.283
when he and I were talking about The Secret,

645
00:26:03.283 --> 00:26:05.954
he said probably the reason that

646
00:26:05.954 --> 00:26:07.524
it has been so successful,

647
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:10.849
is Rhonda had such a pure intention.

648
00:26:10.849 --> 00:26:13.836
She wanted this information to get into the hands

649
00:26:13.836 --> 00:26:17.135
of humanity 'cause she knew it would make a difference.

650
00:26:17.135 --> 00:26:18.541
And you know, the last--

651
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:19.604
<v Voiceover>And she's done it.</v>

652
00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:22.106
<v ->She really has, in the last six letters</v>

653
00:26:22.106 --> 00:26:25.202
of attraction are action.

654
00:26:25.202 --> 00:26:27.870
And the idea is that, yeah, we understand

655
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.679
there's probably not enough focus

656
00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:32.020
on what actions we need to take,

657
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.785
but it's okay, you know,

658
00:26:33.785 --> 00:26:35.347
that's, we've raised the level

659
00:26:35.347 --> 00:26:36.249
of conversation now.

660
00:26:36.249 --> 00:26:37.589
So that's the good news.

661
00:26:37.589 --> 00:26:38.849
<v Voiceover>The seeds have been planted.</v>

662
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:39.548
<v ->That's right.</v>

663
00:26:39.548 --> 00:26:41.952
<v Voiceover>Well, there's--</v>

664
00:26:41.952 --> 00:26:43.162
<v ->We're going to talk about--</v>

665
00:26:43.162 --> 00:26:44.355
<v Voiceover>I wanna talk about education.</v>

666
00:26:44.355 --> 00:26:45.995
<v ->Education and also the eidetics.</v>

667
00:26:45.995 --> 00:26:47.461
<v Voiceover>The eidetics, yes.</v>

668
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:48.894
So, would you like,

669
00:26:48.894 --> 00:26:50.469
let's talk about, do you mind talking about

670
00:26:50.469 --> 00:26:51.701
the education first?

671
00:26:51.701 --> 00:26:54.432
Because this is really where it's happening

672
00:26:54.432 --> 00:26:56.469
or not happening.

673
00:26:56.469 --> 00:26:59.678
The whole notion of taking the magic

674
00:26:59.678 --> 00:27:01.848
and the mystical and the creativity

675
00:27:01.848 --> 00:27:04.814
away from our children in the educational system.

676
00:27:04.814 --> 00:27:08.179
<v ->In the foreword of Maria Montessori's book,</v>

677
00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:10.151
Dr. Buckminister Fuller,

678
00:27:10.151 --> 00:27:12.329
great inventor and thinker,

679
00:27:12.329 --> 00:27:13.997
wrote the foreword,

680
00:27:13.997 --> 00:27:16.125
and he said out of 10,000 children

681
00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:17.898
that are born in the world,

682
00:27:17.898 --> 00:27:21.767
9,999 of them will have been systematically

683
00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:25.401
de-geniused by the time they get to the fifth grade,

684
00:27:25.401 --> 00:27:28.927
by well intentioned, well meaning adults.

685
00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:31.812
Now here's an interesting side bar to that,

686
00:27:31.812 --> 00:27:34.434
my kids, from the very get go,

687
00:27:34.434 --> 00:27:37.009
were all identified for the Gifted Pullout Program

688
00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:38.651
within our schools.

689
00:27:38.651 --> 00:27:41.285
We always had our kids in the public school system.

690
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:45.058
And there are two and then five years

691
00:27:46.088 --> 00:27:48.064
separating our three boys.

692
00:27:50.204 --> 00:27:52.233
Each one of them, when they were getting ready

693
00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:53.597
to go into the fifth grade,

694
00:27:53.597 --> 00:27:56.201
each one of them came to me

695
00:27:56.201 --> 00:27:58.369
and said, "Dad, I don't wanna go into

696
00:27:58.369 --> 00:28:00.163
"the Wings program this year."

697
00:28:00.163 --> 00:28:02.211
Which was their gifted program.

698
00:28:02.211 --> 00:28:05.273
And I said, "Oh, sweetheart, you know,

699
00:28:05.273 --> 00:28:07.614
"there aren't many things that I'm gonna insist on,

700
00:28:07.614 --> 00:28:10.814
"in your educational career, but I really am

701
00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:13.391
"going to ask you to please reconsider

702
00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:14.291
"and do this.

703
00:28:14.291 --> 00:28:18.627
"You are so bright, you have such a brilliant thinking mind,

704
00:28:18.627 --> 00:28:21.765
"you need the extra challenge that will be here.

705
00:28:21.765 --> 00:28:23.732
"If you go into the regular classroom,

706
00:28:23.732 --> 00:28:26.523
"you'll get dumbed down like everybody else does.

707
00:28:26.523 --> 00:28:29.593
"Now let me ask you, is the reason that you don't

708
00:28:29.593 --> 00:28:31.961
"wanna go into the Wing's program,

709
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:33.710
"because none of your friends wanna be there?"

710
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.343
Yeah, none of my friends wanna be in there,

711
00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:36.901
none of it.

712
00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:40.238
I said of course, 'cause none of them wanna do the work.

713
00:28:40.238 --> 00:28:42.348
But you love the work, don't you?

714
00:28:42.348 --> 00:28:43.641
Yeah, I do.

715
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:44.716
(laughing)

716
00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:46.480
So stay with it.

717
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.914
They all stayed with it and they were all glad

718
00:28:48.914 --> 00:28:50.895
that they did.

719
00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.387
Well, here's this idea.

720
00:28:52.387 --> 00:28:53.289
Why?

721
00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:55.829
Even though my wife and I had the commitment

722
00:28:55.829 --> 00:29:00.199
that our main job as parents is to prevent them

723
00:29:00.199 --> 00:29:02.504
from getting degeniused,

724
00:29:02.504 --> 00:29:04.887
why is it that naturally,

725
00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:06.544
they would reach that place

726
00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.244
where they were getting ready to check out.

727
00:29:09.244 --> 00:29:12.047
I mean, really, most of us by the second grade

728
00:29:12.047 --> 00:29:13.911
look at what's going on and say,

729
00:29:13.911 --> 00:29:16.746
oh no, it's not gonna get any better than this.

730
00:29:16.746 --> 00:29:20.522
My youngest son saw his two older brothers going to school

731
00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:22.091
and he was three and a half years old,

732
00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:25.062
and he said, "I'm going to go to school this year."

733
00:29:25.062 --> 00:29:28.087
I said, "Scotty, it's a little early.

734
00:29:28.087 --> 00:29:29.632
"School doesn't start for a few--"

735
00:29:29.632 --> 00:29:32.197
No, I'm going to go to school this year.

736
00:29:32.197 --> 00:29:34.672
So my wife scrambled around to get a preschool program

737
00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:35.996
he could go to.

738
00:29:35.996 --> 00:29:37.871
Got him all lined up, got him all set,

739
00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:39.303
he came back from his first day of school,

740
00:29:39.303 --> 00:29:42.236
I said, "Scotty, how did you like it, how was it?"

741
00:29:42.236 --> 00:29:45.278
He said, "They made me sit down."

742
00:29:45.278 --> 00:29:46.948
(laughing)

743
00:29:46.948 --> 00:29:48.648
<v Voiceover>Big draw back to a three and a half year old.</v>

744
00:29:48.648 --> 00:29:50.506
<v ->It's like, sit down, be quiet,</v>

745
00:29:50.506 --> 00:29:53.145
pay attention, I'm gonna put something meaningless

746
00:29:53.145 --> 00:29:55.623
on the board and you're gonna get tested.

747
00:29:55.623 --> 00:29:58.618
It's oh my gosh, so you know,

748
00:29:58.618 --> 00:30:02.329
the idea is that we have well intentioned adults

749
00:30:02.329 --> 00:30:04.919
that are trying to enculturate the kids,

750
00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:07.102
but what are they enculturating into?

751
00:30:07.102 --> 00:30:09.838
It's oppression military model,

752
00:30:09.838 --> 00:30:12.142
designed to take an Agrarian culture

753
00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:14.934
and make them good fighters in a war.

754
00:30:14.934 --> 00:30:19.741
That model became adopted in the English

755
00:30:19.741 --> 00:30:23.616
and in the United States as the ideal model

756
00:30:23.616 --> 00:30:25.877
to help take an Agrarian culture,

757
00:30:25.877 --> 00:30:28.388
and bring them into an industrial age

758
00:30:28.388 --> 00:30:31.792
where people need to be good factory workers.

759
00:30:31.792 --> 00:30:33.960
Perfect, so the Stanford Binet Test,

760
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.890
the IQ measure, was originally designed

761
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.623
to decide who was worthy of reproduction in our society.

762
00:30:40.623 --> 00:30:41.605
<v Voiceover>Truly, I didn't know that.</v>

763
00:30:41.605 --> 00:30:44.595
<v ->Those who were not going to be intelligent enough</v>

764
00:30:44.595 --> 00:30:46.701
they were going to be sterilized,

765
00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:48.276
and not allowed to reproduce.

766
00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:48.970
Yeah.

767
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.915
<v Voiceover>Where is this hidden piece of information</v>

768
00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.272
or is it hiding in plain sight?

769
00:30:52.272 --> 00:30:53.240
I never heard that.

770
00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.206
<v ->Yeah, if you go into the original history,</v>

771
00:30:55.206 --> 00:30:57.518
there was a whole group that were really supporting

772
00:30:57.518 --> 00:30:59.184
this idea of measurement.

773
00:30:59.184 --> 00:31:01.755
Now, those sorts of things got buried,

774
00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:06.188
and we ended up using the intelligence quotion,

775
00:31:06.188 --> 00:31:08.591
as a way to identify intelligence.

776
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:10.587
But what it really does,

777
00:31:10.587 --> 00:31:12.832
is it excludes and it marginalizes.

778
00:31:12.832 --> 00:31:13.502
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

779
00:31:13.502 --> 00:31:16.204
<v ->And so what we've got is a culture that's designed</v>

780
00:31:16.204 --> 00:31:18.060
to keep the culture in place,

781
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.538
and there is this exclusion and marginalization

782
00:31:21.538 --> 00:31:25.249
separation, according to ability, capacity,

783
00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:28.417
sometimes race, at least it was for many generations

784
00:31:28.417 --> 00:31:29.513
in our culture.

785
00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:31.021
And so what we ended up doing,

786
00:31:31.021 --> 00:31:32.185
is well, oh, you're the A student,

787
00:31:32.185 --> 00:31:33.379
well you can go on.

788
00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:36.380
Well, innovations in education are saying no.

789
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.022
The student has a willingness

790
00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:39.391
regardless of their performance

791
00:31:39.391 --> 00:31:40.593
up until now.

792
00:31:40.593 --> 00:31:42.598
They have a right to be in this program.

793
00:31:42.598 --> 00:31:44.960
Should no longer exclude and marginalize.

794
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.034
Just like we're, we don't see everyday racism.

795
00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:51.528
We don't see it in our culture and our jokes

796
00:31:51.528 --> 00:31:53.873
and when, you know, we saw somebody

797
00:31:53.873 --> 00:31:57.174
in the media losing his job as a result of

798
00:31:57.174 --> 00:32:00.345
a racist comment, it started awakening people

799
00:32:00.345 --> 00:32:04.586
to the recognition that we have this bias

800
00:32:04.586 --> 00:32:06.884
that we don't ever question.

801
00:32:06.884 --> 00:32:10.920
We don't question the bias of our educational systems.

802
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.322
And so our educators are being trained

803
00:32:13.322 --> 00:32:16.201
in a model that they were educated in.

804
00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:18.796
And as a result, it's like Carly Yung said,

805
00:32:18.796 --> 00:32:22.130
how can you know the dragon that swallowed you?

806
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.339
You're in it.

807
00:32:24.339 --> 00:32:28.430
If this is how we learned then we're going to reproduce

808
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.609
that as our default position.

809
00:32:31.609 --> 00:32:34.917
So when there is a big initiative here in this country to

810
00:32:34.917 --> 00:32:36.983
leave no child behind--

811
00:32:36.983 --> 00:32:38.822
<v Voiceover>I was just going to ask you.</v>

812
00:32:38.822 --> 00:32:40.418
<v ->This initiative--
<v Voiceover>What a disaster.</v>

813
00:32:40.418 --> 00:32:44.258
<v ->It's an initiative to test kids.</v>

814
00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:45.850
Now think about this.

815
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.723
I'm sure you always loved the opportunity to be tested

816
00:32:49.723 --> 00:32:50.935
when you were in school, right?

817
00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:51.902
It's like, oh good, I can't wait.

818
00:32:51.902 --> 00:32:52.731
<v Voiceover>It was my favorite thing.</v>

819
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:55.338
Forget that art class and music, test me.

820
00:32:55.338 --> 00:32:56.893
<v ->Let's get tested, ooh, a math test.</v>

821
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:58.127
Oh yay.

822
00:32:58.127 --> 00:33:01.376
No, I mean, the thing that created more stress

823
00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:04.276
in you as a child was getting tested, why?

824
00:33:04.276 --> 00:33:06.009
Because you're gonna be evaluated,

825
00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:07.679
you're gonna find out what you didn't know,

826
00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:09.551
and you're probably gonna be punished

827
00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:10.913
if you didn't do it well.

828
00:33:10.913 --> 00:33:11.453
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

829
00:33:11.453 --> 00:33:14.543
<v ->Now stress has an effect at every level</v>

830
00:33:14.543 --> 00:33:16.180
of our cognitive systems.

831
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.521
On our attention, our perception,

832
00:33:18.521 --> 00:33:20.657
our thinking, our decision making,

833
00:33:20.657 --> 00:33:21.796
and our memory.

834
00:33:21.796 --> 00:33:23.746
In fact, there are some kids

835
00:33:23.746 --> 00:33:25.969
that don't test well.

836
00:33:25.969 --> 00:33:27.592
I'll give you an example of a man

837
00:33:27.592 --> 00:33:31.135
who was in the World Health Organization,

838
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:35.143
medical doctor, epidemiologist,

839
00:33:35.673 --> 00:33:40.402
he had six graduate degrees, four post doctoral degrees,

840
00:33:41.202 --> 00:33:44.220
brilliant man, he failed every class he went to

841
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.089
in high school and by sophomore year

842
00:33:47.089 --> 00:33:48.943
he was such a behavior problem,

843
00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:52.252
he was either gonna get kicked out,

844
00:33:52.252 --> 00:33:53.067
or,

845
00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:58.199
he was going to leave

846
00:33:58.199 --> 00:33:59.589
and never come back.

847
00:33:59.589 --> 00:34:01.759
And one of the counselors said,

848
00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:03.539
"Why don't you go to college?"

849
00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:05.368
He looked at him and said, "Are you insane?

850
00:34:05.368 --> 00:34:06.834
"How can I go to college, I can't,

851
00:34:08.214 --> 00:34:09.985
I can't pass a test here."

852
00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:11.940
He said well go to college,

853
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.348
'cause some people just, they don't do well with high school

854
00:34:14.348 --> 00:34:15.182
don't worry about it.

855
00:34:15.182 --> 00:34:16.818
Go to college but tell them that

856
00:34:16.818 --> 00:34:19.587
the only way that you can be tested

857
00:34:19.587 --> 00:34:21.556
is orally.

858
00:34:21.556 --> 00:34:23.023
Skyrocketed.

859
00:34:23.023 --> 00:34:25.723
At every grade level that he went to

860
00:34:25.723 --> 00:34:27.798
in every class, he was at the top of his class,

861
00:34:27.798 --> 00:34:30.863
he graduated number one in his class

862
00:34:30.863 --> 00:34:33.195
in every post doctorate degree

863
00:34:33.195 --> 00:34:34.331
that he was in.

864
00:34:34.331 --> 00:34:36.299
Now here's this whole idea,

865
00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:37.963
now here we've got this initiative,

866
00:34:37.963 --> 00:34:39.372
the way we're gonna improve education

867
00:34:39.372 --> 00:34:40.976
is by testing everyone.

868
00:34:40.976 --> 00:34:44.259
Now that stresses the administration,

869
00:34:44.259 --> 00:34:46.576
they pass that stress to the teachers,

870
00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:50.246
the teachers now insist on teaching to the test,

871
00:34:50.246 --> 00:34:52.722
so forget about social studies,

872
00:34:52.722 --> 00:34:53.985
we don't have time for it,

873
00:34:53.985 --> 00:34:55.422
art, are you kidding?

874
00:34:55.422 --> 00:34:59.459
Even though art improves math performance,

875
00:34:59.459 --> 00:35:02.127
we're gonna drop art and music out.

876
00:35:02.127 --> 00:35:04.326
Even though physical education

877
00:35:04.326 --> 00:35:06.632
improves performance and memory,

878
00:35:06.632 --> 00:35:07.928
we're gonna drop it because we don't have time,

879
00:35:07.928 --> 00:35:09.833
we gotta focus on doing well on the test.

880
00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:11.163
Insane.

881
00:35:11.163 --> 00:35:12.235
Absolutely insane.

882
00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:13.233
<v Voiceover>It is insane.</v>

883
00:35:13.233 --> 00:35:15.675
<v ->Well, you see, but we don't see the insanity</v>

884
00:35:15.675 --> 00:35:18.879
because of course, if we're going to improve education

885
00:35:18.879 --> 00:35:20.205
we gotta know how we're doing

886
00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:21.749
and then find the bad areas

887
00:35:21.749 --> 00:35:26.565
and put our emphasis on overcoming the deficits within it.

888
00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:30.520
You see, if we always think in that way

889
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.447
we're always gonna try to reproduce,

890
00:35:32.447 --> 00:35:34.899
we're always gonna try to solve the problem,

891
00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.227
at the level of thinking that put the problem

892
00:35:37.227 --> 00:35:38.687
there to begin with.

893
00:35:38.687 --> 00:35:41.980
And you see, when we talk about a paradigm shift,

894
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.399
got a problem, we got a solution to it,

895
00:35:45.399 --> 00:35:47.470
the problem is kids aren't doing well,

896
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:49.042
well let's test them,

897
00:35:49.042 --> 00:35:51.011
that testing creates more problems.

898
00:35:51.011 --> 00:35:52.749
And so we've got the solution, problem,

899
00:35:52.749 --> 00:35:56.176
solution, problem, this back and forth thing,

900
00:35:56.176 --> 00:36:00.113
well, sure, but it's all within a paradigm that says

901
00:36:00.113 --> 00:36:01.682
this is what education is,

902
00:36:01.682 --> 00:36:04.459
let's go to a different place.

903
00:36:04.459 --> 00:36:06.862
Let's solve the way we're solving the problem.

904
00:36:06.862 --> 00:36:07.927
Think of it this way.

905
00:36:07.927 --> 00:36:10.860
You ever heard about being graded on a bell curve?

906
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.429
So 20% are gonna pass whether they do anything or not,

907
00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:15.401
they're gonna be fine,

908
00:36:15.401 --> 00:36:16.567
60% in the middle,

909
00:36:16.567 --> 00:36:19.375
20% are gonna fail no matter what you do for them.

910
00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:22.277
Well, a bell curve actually represents

911
00:36:22.277 --> 00:36:24.668
a random distribution of events.

912
00:36:25.708 --> 00:36:26.601
That's what it is, it's a,

913
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:27.879
that's what a bell curve is,

914
00:36:27.879 --> 00:36:30.152
it's a random distribution of events.

915
00:36:30.152 --> 00:36:32.109
Well, if we grade on a bell curve,

916
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:33.252
what we're saying is,

917
00:36:33.252 --> 00:36:35.384
education is a random event.

918
00:36:36.304 --> 00:36:37.427
In a way it is,

919
00:36:37.427 --> 00:36:40.623
if I have one teacher with one teaching style

920
00:36:40.623 --> 00:36:44.478
and 30 students with 30 learning styles,

921
00:36:45.401 --> 00:36:46.430
what am I gonna get?

922
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.035
<v Voiceover>Random.</v>

923
00:36:47.035 --> 00:36:49.063
<v ->A bell curve of random distribution event.</v>

924
00:36:49.063 --> 00:36:50.436
20 of them are gonna do great

925
00:36:50.436 --> 00:36:52.573
'cause they learn just like the teacher teaches.

926
00:36:52.573 --> 00:36:53.307
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

927
00:36:53.307 --> 00:36:54.199
<v ->You see?</v>

928
00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:57.238
And then 20% are gonna fail no matter what

929
00:36:57.238 --> 00:36:59.313
and the teacher's going to point at you

930
00:36:59.313 --> 00:37:01.607
and say, "You're learning disabled."

931
00:37:01.607 --> 00:37:03.212
They're not gonna see the three fingers

932
00:37:03.212 --> 00:37:06.547
pointing back at them and say I'm teaching disabled.

933
00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:09.316
Because we don't question the teaching model,

934
00:37:09.316 --> 00:37:11.238
everybody else does well,

935
00:37:11.238 --> 00:37:12.924
I had to go through it, you have to go through it,

936
00:37:12.924 --> 00:37:14.520
everybody's gotta go through this.

937
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.235
We never question that the academic hierarchy

938
00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:21.223
is in position to keep creativity

939
00:37:21.223 --> 00:37:24.922
in the academic hierarchy limited.

940
00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.608
You see, and we're gonna exclude anything that doesn't

941
00:37:27.608 --> 00:37:30.939
really fulfill our model of what teaching and learning is.

942
00:37:30.939 --> 00:37:32.539
<v Voiceover>And then, immediately, what's removed</v>

943
00:37:32.539 --> 00:37:34.083
from the equation is,

944
00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:35.943
once the stress increases,

945
00:37:35.943 --> 00:37:39.779
you have removed the joy of learning and of teaching.

946
00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:41.686
<v ->Beautifully put, beautifully put.</v>

947
00:37:41.686 --> 00:37:45.208
The degeniusing is really a shock to the system.

948
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:49.031
Because if we're all naturally genius level thinkers

949
00:37:49.031 --> 00:37:52.696
and potential and then suddenly we go into failure,

950
00:37:53.826 --> 00:37:57.366
then we start framing everything as I am a failure,

951
00:37:57.366 --> 00:37:59.265
not that I have failed to learn this,

952
00:37:59.265 --> 00:38:02.432
I wonder how I might learn it in some other way,

953
00:38:03.242 --> 00:38:04.646
I think I am a failure.

954
00:38:04.646 --> 00:38:06.842
Well, that's the devastation and you know,

955
00:38:06.842 --> 00:38:07.943
I've got examples of this,

956
00:38:07.943 --> 00:38:10.649
because I teach teachers all over the world,

957
00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:14.875
to teach using a more holistic brain based accelerative,

958
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:18.260
teaching and learning that engages the whole person,

959
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.618
engages the whole mind,

960
00:38:20.618 --> 00:38:25.213
engages the conscious and the non-conscious capacities

961
00:38:25.213 --> 00:38:28.419
these brilliant hidden resources,

962
00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:31.171
that are within each individual,

963
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:33.899
so by teaching and learning in these other ways,

964
00:38:33.899 --> 00:38:37.644
we're actually able to recover so many of the kids

965
00:38:37.644 --> 00:38:39.764
that would normally have fallen off

966
00:38:39.764 --> 00:38:43.166
the conveyor belt that education is running.

967
00:38:44.076 --> 00:38:45.685
<v Voiceover>And when you're talking about,</v>

968
00:38:45.685 --> 00:38:46.920
I don't know if this is the right time

969
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.147
to go into it or not,

970
00:38:48.147 --> 00:38:49.584
because we wanna get to the eidetics,

971
00:38:49.584 --> 00:38:52.455
but you're speaking about this genius,

972
00:38:53.325 --> 00:38:56.956
is not only from within but it's from without.

973
00:38:56.956 --> 00:38:59.296
In that we are in a quantum field

974
00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:02.698
and if we are in this receptive place and state of mind

975
00:39:02.698 --> 00:39:04.134
that you speak of,

976
00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:07.235
we're actually being fed information constantly,

977
00:39:07.235 --> 00:39:09.500
it's not just what we're, we personally possess

978
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.046
from our own experience,

979
00:39:11.046 --> 00:39:14.311
and that seems to be tossed out of the equation as well,

980
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:16.715
there's no way to access it under these conditions.

981
00:39:16.715 --> 00:39:18.180
<v ->Excellent, if all we're doing is</v>

982
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.053
teaching to the conscious mind,

983
00:39:20.053 --> 00:39:23.779
you're right, so much of this vast, non-conscious ability

984
00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:26.618
which remains really marginalized

985
00:39:26.618 --> 00:39:28.618
and really off line for most of us,

986
00:39:28.618 --> 00:39:30.565
like, intuition, creativity,

987
00:39:30.565 --> 00:39:32.531
oh, she's too creative,

988
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:33.903
no she doesn't follow the rules,

989
00:39:33.903 --> 00:39:35.228
she's too creative.

990
00:39:35.228 --> 00:39:39.205
And so we end up forcing our creativity

991
00:39:39.205 --> 00:39:42.401
into this long black bag we drag behind us,

992
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:45.279
and this is what we call our shadow script.

993
00:39:45.279 --> 00:39:49.375
Now, it's gotta come out in really bizarre ways, you see,

994
00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:53.300
because our darker side needs to express itself.

995
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.117
<v Voiceover>And how is it coming out,</v>

996
00:39:54.117 --> 00:39:55.587
how do we compensate as a species

997
00:39:55.587 --> 00:39:56.642
for this oppression?

998
00:39:56.642 --> 00:39:58.554
<v ->Well, what happens is, you know,</v>

999
00:39:58.554 --> 00:40:01.427
creativity has to find a way.

1000
00:40:01.822 --> 00:40:04.031
So if you look at the state of our society,

1001
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:06.602
you see it as a natural progression.

1002
00:40:06.602 --> 00:40:09.062
How many kids are dropping out of school?

1003
00:40:09.062 --> 00:40:10.434
How many kids don't do well,

1004
00:40:10.434 --> 00:40:11.761
don't do the work?

1005
00:40:11.761 --> 00:40:14.161
Asian kids coming into the United States,

1006
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:16.504
realize that they get good grades

1007
00:40:16.504 --> 00:40:18.710
because they work really hard at it.

1008
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.974
Kids in the United States look at the Asian kids

1009
00:40:21.974 --> 00:40:25.126
and they say well they do well 'cause they're smart.

1010
00:40:25.308 --> 00:40:27.642
They don't get that it's the work, you know,

1011
00:40:27.642 --> 00:40:30.256
work building the dendrites of the brain

1012
00:40:30.256 --> 00:40:32.153
and work of engaging the mind,

1013
00:40:32.153 --> 00:40:34.421
work of overcoming the failures

1014
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:37.864
of early learning trials to get to

1015
00:40:37.864 --> 00:40:40.703
the success that is possible for them.

1016
00:40:40.703 --> 00:40:44.269
And so we end up giving up way too easily

1017
00:40:44.269 --> 00:40:46.169
and adult learners are classics of this.

1018
00:40:46.169 --> 00:40:47.367
We try something three times,

1019
00:40:47.367 --> 00:40:48.411
if we don't get it,

1020
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:49.804
I'm never gonna be able to do that.

1021
00:40:49.804 --> 00:40:50.876
(laughing)

1022
00:40:50.876 --> 00:40:52.345
But that's really the minefield,

1023
00:40:52.345 --> 00:40:53.348
that's the idea,

1024
00:40:53.348 --> 00:40:56.181
of adult learning and human development.

1025
00:40:57.131 --> 00:40:59.708
Well, when we come back to this idea

1026
00:40:59.708 --> 00:41:03.218
the word genius, the origin of the word genius,

1027
00:41:03.218 --> 00:41:05.637
is from the Greek.

1028
00:41:05.748 --> 00:41:10.493
And the term represented an angelic presence

1029
00:41:10.493 --> 00:41:14.193
that's born into your life with you,

1030
00:41:14.193 --> 00:41:17.099
that's there to guide and assist you.

1031
00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:19.874
In the cultures of the Middle East

1032
00:41:19.874 --> 00:41:21.977
they had the concept of the genie.

1033
00:41:21.977 --> 00:41:22.842
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1034
00:41:22.842 --> 00:41:25.501
<v ->The jinn, J-I-N-N,</v>

1035
00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:26.843
that's the same origin,

1036
00:41:26.843 --> 00:41:29.715
it's the same, there is a higher power

1037
00:41:29.715 --> 00:41:31.320
that's able to guide us.

1038
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.084
But if we exclude that from the equation

1039
00:41:34.084 --> 00:41:36.023
of teaching and learning,

1040
00:41:36.023 --> 00:41:38.657
kids never get an opportunity to contact that

1041
00:41:38.657 --> 00:41:40.823
and allow it to express itself.

1042
00:41:40.823 --> 00:41:44.081
Really, we are left degeniused.

1043
00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:45.798
It's as if that genius capacity

1044
00:41:45.798 --> 00:41:49.230
it's not just from within, it is from without,

1045
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.734
there's an interaction.

1046
00:41:50.734 --> 00:41:53.337
We feed forward into the world,

1047
00:41:53.337 --> 00:41:56.474
we receive feedback that informs us

1048
00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:58.704
and so we become more skilled.

1049
00:41:58.704 --> 00:42:01.686
We do need to build skill sets

1050
00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:05.494
that assist us in succeeding in the world.

1051
00:42:06.211 --> 00:42:07.454
But some of us,

1052
00:42:07.454 --> 00:42:09.585
in failing to pass a test,

1053
00:42:09.585 --> 00:42:12.685
we just decide, I'm no good at math.

1054
00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:15.587
I'm no good at art, whatever it might be.

1055
00:42:15.587 --> 00:42:18.426
I'm great at my career but I'm lousy in relationships.

1056
00:42:18.426 --> 00:42:21.359
I'm great in relationships but I'm lousy in my career.

1057
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:23.728
At some point we switched off and so

1058
00:42:23.728 --> 00:42:26.275
a model that I created called Natural Brilliance,

1059
00:42:26.275 --> 00:42:29.938
re-initializes that natural genius level,

1060
00:42:31.088 --> 00:42:32.679
creative ability,

1061
00:42:32.679 --> 00:42:34.583
and allows you to learn whatever it is

1062
00:42:34.583 --> 00:42:35.413
you need to learn.

1063
00:42:35.413 --> 00:42:37.313
<v Voiceover>Does this stuff deal with the eidetics?</v>

1064
00:42:38.103 --> 00:42:38.721
<v ->No.</v>

1065
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:40.022
<v Voiceover>They're two separate things,</v>

1066
00:42:40.022 --> 00:42:41.754
which way do you want to go?

1067
00:42:41.754 --> 00:42:43.691
They're both intriguing.

1068
00:42:43.691 --> 00:42:44.440
You choose.

1069
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.422
<v ->You need a couple more shows.</v>

1070
00:42:45.422 --> 00:42:46.249
<v Voiceover>We sure do.</v>

1071
00:42:46.249 --> 00:42:47.997
Well, tell me, which one,

1072
00:42:47.997 --> 00:42:50.092
we have some, a little bit of time left here,

1073
00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:51.196
which way would you like to go?

1074
00:42:51.196 --> 00:42:52.460
<v ->Well, let me just say,</v>

1075
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.799
in terms of this natural brilliance,

1076
00:42:54.799 --> 00:42:56.561
because we're really on this topic of

1077
00:42:56.561 --> 00:42:58.559
teaching and learning.

1078
00:42:58.559 --> 00:43:00.371
If you realize, there are areas of your life

1079
00:43:00.371 --> 00:43:01.335
where you succeed.

1080
00:43:01.335 --> 00:43:02.897
You've always succeeded in it,

1081
00:43:02.897 --> 00:43:04.034
you've always done well in it,

1082
00:43:04.034 --> 00:43:06.611
and there's areas of your life where no matter what you do,

1083
00:43:06.611 --> 00:43:09.344
you keep getting the same failures over and over again.

1084
00:43:09.344 --> 00:43:12.148
Try something new and still, you know,

1085
00:43:12.148 --> 00:43:14.258
get the same result three months later,

1086
00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:16.053
you're at the same place you were before.

1087
00:43:16.053 --> 00:43:18.989
And that's okay, it's what we call a stuck state.

1088
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:20.527
There's an oscillation going on.

1089
00:43:20.527 --> 00:43:22.092
You wanna do well, you can't do well.

1090
00:43:22.092 --> 00:43:23.428
You wanna try it, you don't wanna try it.

1091
00:43:23.428 --> 00:43:25.460
Because you're afraid you're gonna fail.

1092
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.000
And as long as that oscillation is going on,

1093
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.235
you stay stuck.

1094
00:43:29.235 --> 00:43:32.009
Think of the oscillation as being your comfort zone.

1095
00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:34.036
From here to here there is a stop sign

1096
00:43:34.036 --> 00:43:35.452
on each end.

1097
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.877
As a result of our conditioning in the world

1098
00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:40.613
the stop sign got put in place

1099
00:43:40.613 --> 00:43:42.473
that said don't go past here.

1100
00:43:42.473 --> 00:43:44.112
If you do, you're in trouble.

1101
00:43:44.112 --> 00:43:48.107
And so we end up living within a narrow margin.

1102
00:43:48.107 --> 00:43:50.992
Some people who are contemplating suicide,

1103
00:43:50.992 --> 00:43:53.821
believe there are only two choices in life.

1104
00:43:53.821 --> 00:43:58.213
It's like, end it now, with a blast of pain,

1105
00:43:58.565 --> 00:44:00.764
or live in this pain forever.

1106
00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:02.136
We don't see, you know,

1107
00:44:02.136 --> 00:44:04.429
literally billions of other choices,

1108
00:44:04.429 --> 00:44:07.176
our world has narrowed to this little space.

1109
00:44:07.176 --> 00:44:09.535
Well, let's pull the stop signs out and say,

1110
00:44:09.535 --> 00:44:11.515
well, hang on just a moment.

1111
00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:14.311
What is true about your life?

1112
00:44:14.311 --> 00:44:18.120
What are the real gifts and resources that you have?

1113
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.984
And this is where the eidetics come in, you see.

1114
00:44:20.984 --> 00:44:23.822
Because once we tap into the truth about

1115
00:44:23.822 --> 00:44:26.128
who you are, the magnificence about who you are,

1116
00:44:26.128 --> 00:44:29.265
you see you have millions of choices

1117
00:44:29.265 --> 00:44:31.231
that you could engage in.

1118
00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:32.744
And so what I've seen is,

1119
00:44:32.744 --> 00:44:35.368
people who have been a failure in school

1120
00:44:35.368 --> 00:44:37.625
be able to achieve great success

1121
00:44:37.625 --> 00:44:40.374
and by using the non-conscious mind,

1122
00:44:40.374 --> 00:44:43.167
engaging those further resources,

1123
00:44:43.167 --> 00:44:47.076
really discovering how much is really possible for them.

1124
00:44:47.076 --> 00:44:49.173
So they give up those ideas of what they can

1125
00:44:49.173 --> 00:44:50.050
or cannot do,

1126
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.513
they break the trance.

1127
00:44:51.513 --> 00:44:53.420
They stop the oscillation.

1128
00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.453
They reinitialize that genius capacity

1129
00:44:56.453 --> 00:44:58.754
for learning that we're born into the world.

1130
00:44:58.754 --> 00:45:00.421
<v Voiceover>Let's take a concrete example,</v>

1131
00:45:00.421 --> 00:45:02.826
just one example of how eidetics works

1132
00:45:02.826 --> 00:45:04.964
to change somebody's experience around.

1133
00:45:04.964 --> 00:45:07.634
<v ->Well, let me start with</v>

1134
00:45:08.714 --> 00:45:10.570
the concept of learning.

1135
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.267
Let's just take the idea of learning

1136
00:45:12.267 --> 00:45:13.640
and think back,

1137
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.772
just allow an image to come into your mind,

1138
00:45:16.772 --> 00:45:17.909
if you would,

1139
00:45:17.909 --> 00:45:21.450
sit back, relax, and allow any image

1140
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.072
to come from your childhood

1141
00:45:24.072 --> 00:45:25.982
when you learned something,

1142
00:45:25.982 --> 00:45:27.913
and you learned it well,

1143
00:45:27.913 --> 00:45:29.222
you learned it easily,

1144
00:45:29.222 --> 00:45:31.717
and you really enjoyed learning it.

1145
00:45:32.617 --> 00:45:34.807
And it may or may not be in school,

1146
00:45:34.807 --> 00:45:37.892
I mean, often times, those kinds of learning experiences

1147
00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:40.512
come from something outside of school.

1148
00:45:41.293 --> 00:45:43.633
And just remember what that felt like.

1149
00:45:43.633 --> 00:45:45.571
What it looked like.

1150
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.674
Who you were at the time.

1151
00:45:47.674 --> 00:45:49.968
And actually go into that you

1152
00:45:49.968 --> 00:45:52.699
that you were at that age.

1153
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:56.475
And remembering how you felt at the time,

1154
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:58.784
and what you believed to be true about yourself

1155
00:45:58.784 --> 00:46:02.201
as a learner in this area of life, right?

1156
00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:07.072
Now remember a time where you failed to learn something.

1157
00:46:08.113 --> 00:46:10.680
And remember what that felt like.

1158
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.591
And remember who was involved with it

1159
00:46:12.591 --> 00:46:13.666
and what that looked like

1160
00:46:13.666 --> 00:46:16.838
and when you are in your body having that experience

1161
00:46:16.838 --> 00:46:19.142
notice where in your body you feel it.

1162
00:46:19.142 --> 00:46:22.271
The meaning that you assign to it.

1163
00:46:22.271 --> 00:46:24.605
See and you carried that with you,

1164
00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:28.816
and if you continue to replay that image of failure

1165
00:46:28.816 --> 00:46:32.481
you can continue to experience that image

1166
00:46:32.481 --> 00:46:34.622
or that feeling and that meaning about

1167
00:46:34.622 --> 00:46:35.883
who you are,

1168
00:46:35.883 --> 00:46:40.376
now try this, this is where the eidetics comes in.

1169
00:46:41.155 --> 00:46:44.382
Go into that feeling of you as someone who

1170
00:46:44.382 --> 00:46:47.258
learned easily in that subject,

1171
00:46:47.258 --> 00:46:49.629
now holding this feeling,

1172
00:46:51.029 --> 00:46:54.635
remember the subject area in which you didn't learn well.

1173
00:46:55.995 --> 00:46:59.242
And how does that image change for you?

1174
00:46:59.242 --> 00:47:00.646
<v Voiceover>Greatly.</v>

1175
00:47:00.646 --> 00:47:02.349
<v ->Describe, what are some of the changes</v>

1176
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:03.551
that occur?

1177
00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:05.154
<v Voiceover>Well, in the first image,</v>

1178
00:47:05.154 --> 00:47:08.632
was learning, because I had, I was essentially blind,

1179
00:47:08.632 --> 00:47:10.891
2400 vision and no one knew it,

1180
00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:13.324
I couldn't see anything 'till about, age of 11.

1181
00:47:13.324 --> 00:47:17.381
So all of my work was done within a foot of my face.

1182
00:47:17.755 --> 00:47:19.736
So for me to be able to use art

1183
00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:21.625
to draw the anatomy,

1184
00:47:21.625 --> 00:47:25.008
I loved physiology, anatomy, and science courses,

1185
00:47:25.748 --> 00:47:27.976
to be able to draw it helped me learn

1186
00:47:27.976 --> 00:47:29.511
and made me very happy.

1187
00:47:29.511 --> 00:47:31.243
Because I could see something,

1188
00:47:31.243 --> 00:47:32.477
because I couldn't see the chalkboard.

1189
00:47:32.477 --> 00:47:33.540
<v Voiceover>Wonderful, so you know what those</v>

1190
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.537
happy feelings are like.

1191
00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:35.674
<v Voiceover>Yes, it's from the chest,</v>

1192
00:47:35.674 --> 00:47:38.835
it flows up into the head and behind the eyes

1193
00:47:38.835 --> 00:47:42.573
and it floats around and it feels wonderful and expansive.

1194
00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:44.850
<v ->So there's an image and there's a feeling,</v>

1195
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.486
so it's the image, the soma,

1196
00:47:47.486 --> 00:47:49.562
the feeling, but then there's also a meaning

1197
00:47:49.562 --> 00:47:50.852
that's attached to that.

1198
00:47:50.852 --> 00:47:52.696
What meaning did that have for you?

1199
00:47:54.276 --> 00:47:55.605
<v Voiceover>I don't know,</v>

1200
00:47:55.605 --> 00:47:57.048
I don't know exactly how to describe,

1201
00:47:57.048 --> 00:47:58.960
to ascribe a meaning to it,

1202
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.705
other than that for me,

1203
00:48:00.705 --> 00:48:02.794
I understood very clearly,

1204
00:48:02.794 --> 00:48:05.775
that creativity was my path to learning.

1205
00:48:05.775 --> 00:48:06.845
<v ->Excellent.</v>

1206
00:48:06.845 --> 00:48:08.083
Excellent, that's the meaning.

1207
00:48:08.083 --> 00:48:09.568
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it always was.</v>

1208
00:48:09.568 --> 00:48:11.117
Creativity was my path to learning.

1209
00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:13.289
The opposite of it was,

1210
00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:15.988
now I had some glasses and I'm sitting in algebra

1211
00:48:15.988 --> 00:48:17.251
in seventh grade,

1212
00:48:17.251 --> 00:48:18.687
and it's very dry,

1213
00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:22.494
and I cannot understand why this is important

1214
00:48:22.494 --> 00:48:23.632
to my life.

1215
00:48:23.632 --> 00:48:24.990
It has no relevance,

1216
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.859
and so I check out and I start drawing.

1217
00:48:29.499 --> 00:48:30.566
I'm doodling and drawing

1218
00:48:30.566 --> 00:48:31.926
all through the classes

1219
00:48:31.926 --> 00:48:33.140
so I failed the class,

1220
00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.090
well I got a D minus,

1221
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:35.340
'cause he said I was so terrible

1222
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.432
he never wanted to see me in his class again.

1223
00:48:37.432 --> 00:48:38.245
<v ->Oh nice.</v>

1224
00:48:38.245 --> 00:48:40.046
<v Voiceover>That was a way, because I didn't do the work,</v>

1225
00:48:40.046 --> 00:48:42.485
because I didn't get, I didn't get it.

1226
00:48:42.485 --> 00:48:43.515
<v ->It wasn't relevant.</v>

1227
00:48:43.515 --> 00:48:44.552
<v Voiceover>Yet.</v>

1228
00:48:44.552 --> 00:48:47.086
Knowing I have a good mind for that sort of thing,

1229
00:48:47.086 --> 00:48:51.582
now taking them and overlaying that feeling of

1230
00:48:51.582 --> 00:48:54.395
the artwork and the gathering of knowledge

1231
00:48:54.395 --> 00:48:55.292
through creativity,

1232
00:48:55.292 --> 00:48:57.464
and now trying to listen to the teacher,

1233
00:48:57.464 --> 00:49:00.160
teaching the algebra from that lens,

1234
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.896
it felt like it was logical and possible

1235
00:49:03.896 --> 00:49:08.008
to understand algebra from the first day,

1236
00:49:08.008 --> 00:49:11.274
because maybe I could hear it in a different way.

1237
00:49:11.274 --> 00:49:13.500
<v ->And when you think about it,</v>

1238
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.351
there's so many ways that could play out.

1239
00:49:16.351 --> 00:49:18.319
For example, did you do better in geometry

1240
00:49:18.319 --> 00:49:19.145
than algebra?

1241
00:49:19.145 --> 00:49:20.206
<v Voiceover>Yeah, definitely.</v>

1242
00:49:20.206 --> 00:49:21.953
<v ->You see, and geometry has, you know,</v>

1243
00:49:21.953 --> 00:49:23.188
it's a different part of the brain

1244
00:49:23.188 --> 00:49:24.792
that you start engaging.

1245
00:49:24.792 --> 00:49:27.180
So you could say well I'm dumb at math

1246
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.520
or you can say well, I didn't do well in that class,

1247
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.987
I'm not dumb at math.

1248
00:49:31.987 --> 00:49:34.872
You see, so you begin to bring that creativity

1249
00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:36.431
and that image and that feeling--

1250
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:38.041
<v Voiceover>And oddly as an adult,</v>

1251
00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.599
because I was always embarrassed

1252
00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.905
because I never understood algebra.

1253
00:49:41.905 --> 00:49:42.868
I never did.

1254
00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:44.690
I shunned it.

1255
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.312
My son, taking algebra, I said honey,

1256
00:49:47.312 --> 00:49:49.182
why don't you teach me algebra?

1257
00:49:49.182 --> 00:49:52.351
When he was at that place in his younger years,

1258
00:49:52.351 --> 00:49:55.285
and so as he taught me because he was,

1259
00:49:55.285 --> 00:49:56.890
he went to the Waldorf schools,

1260
00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.655
it was all made fun and everything,

1261
00:49:58.655 --> 00:50:00.729
they had much more creativity at the base of it,

1262
00:50:00.729 --> 00:50:03.814
he was teaching me in the way he had learned algebra,

1263
00:50:04.594 --> 00:50:06.531
and all of a sudden, within two seconds,

1264
00:50:06.531 --> 00:50:07.732
I understood algebra.

1265
00:50:07.732 --> 00:50:08.795
<v ->Yay!</v>

1266
00:50:08.795 --> 00:50:09.835
<v Voiceover>That's all there was to it,</v>

1267
00:50:09.835 --> 00:50:12.156
it was the way in which it was introduced.

1268
00:50:12.156 --> 00:50:14.569
<v ->And here's such a beautiful opportunity,</v>

1269
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:17.480
you know, when we realize that we can recover a part

1270
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.416
of ourselves that had been lost,

1271
00:50:20.416 --> 00:50:22.410
as a result of an image that we continue

1272
00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.888
to replay about math and algebra and all that,

1273
00:50:25.888 --> 00:50:29.650
and we can begin to focus on those images

1274
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:32.693
and those feelings that really store

1275
00:50:32.693 --> 00:50:34.893
the true resource that we are,

1276
00:50:34.893 --> 00:50:37.231
the true capacity that we have.

1277
00:50:37.231 --> 00:50:39.998
That expands, then it can generalize.

1278
00:50:39.998 --> 00:50:42.470
It can distort and generalize in positive ways

1279
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.503
throughout our lives.

1280
00:50:43.503 --> 00:50:44.367
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1281
00:50:44.367 --> 00:50:45.326
<v ->Well, I'll give you a,</v>

1282
00:50:45.326 --> 00:50:47.369
let's talk about eidetics for just a minute.

1283
00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:49.943
This is an example of the use of eidetics,

1284
00:50:49.943 --> 00:50:51.644
in teaching and learning,

1285
00:50:51.644 --> 00:50:54.081
and there are a lot of other actual specific images

1286
00:50:54.081 --> 00:50:55.815
that can be helpful,

1287
00:50:55.815 --> 00:50:58.618
but let me just, for those who are watching

1288
00:50:58.618 --> 00:51:01.690
to understand a bit about Dr. Ahsen's work--

1289
00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:02.455
<v Voiceover>How do you spell his name</v>

1290
00:51:02.455 --> 00:51:03.858
so people can look him up online?

1291
00:51:03.858 --> 00:51:07.326
<v ->It's A-H-S-E-N, Ahsen.</v>

1292
00:51:07.326 --> 00:51:08.460
<v Voiceover>Okay, alright.</v>

1293
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.225
<v ->And his first name is Akhter,</v>

1294
00:51:10.225 --> 00:51:13.225
A-K-H-T-E-R.

1295
00:51:13.225 --> 00:51:14.936
<v Voiceover>Okay, Akhter Ahsen.</v>

1296
00:51:14.936 --> 00:51:16.824
<v ->Dr. Akhter.</v>

1297
00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:17.967
<v Voiceover>Dr. Akhter.</v>

1298
00:51:17.967 --> 00:51:19.576
<v ->Dr. Akhter Ahsen.</v>

1299
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.567
Brilliant, brilliant thinker,

1300
00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:23.269
if you get a chance to study with him

1301
00:51:23.269 --> 00:51:24.033
he's fabulous.

1302
00:51:24.033 --> 00:51:25.312
You should get him on your show.

1303
00:51:25.312 --> 00:51:25.967
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1304
00:51:25.967 --> 00:51:27.948
Well, I'm circling it right now.

1305
00:51:27.948 --> 00:51:30.947
<v ->So, let me just give you something</v>

1306
00:51:30.947 --> 00:51:33.816
from what he calls the eidetics parents test,

1307
00:51:33.816 --> 00:51:35.955
which is quite an interesting image.

1308
00:51:35.955 --> 00:51:38.028
Imagine yourself as a child,

1309
00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.425
seven, eight, or nine years old,

1310
00:51:39.425 --> 00:51:42.191
in the home of your parents where you grew up,

1311
00:51:42.191 --> 00:51:45.343
and see your parents standing in front of you.

1312
00:51:46.498 --> 00:51:48.436
If you need to close your eyes to do this that's great,

1313
00:51:48.436 --> 00:51:51.329
because it takes out extraneous visual information,

1314
00:51:52.379 --> 00:51:54.634
but as you look at this image,

1315
00:51:54.634 --> 00:51:57.610
see your parents standing there in front of you,

1316
00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.809
which of your parents is on the left?

1317
00:51:59.809 --> 00:52:01.544
And which is on the right?

1318
00:52:01.544 --> 00:52:03.521
So just notice that, for you.

1319
00:52:05.311 --> 00:52:09.130
Now, switch their positions.

1320
00:52:09.658 --> 00:52:12.285
And notice what happens to the image.

1321
00:52:14.535 --> 00:52:16.230
So in your case, what happened?

1322
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.697
<v Voiceover>My mother was on the left</v>

1323
00:52:17.697 --> 00:52:19.085
in the initial one.

1324
00:52:19.085 --> 00:52:22.924
And then my father was more of a shadow on the right

1325
00:52:22.924 --> 00:52:25.169
and when they switched positions,

1326
00:52:25.169 --> 00:52:27.738
and my father was on the left,

1327
00:52:27.738 --> 00:52:32.673
then he was, it was a full image of light and brilliance

1328
00:52:32.673 --> 00:52:34.078
of both of them.

1329
00:52:34.078 --> 00:52:35.640
A vividness on the left,

1330
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.254
but in both cases, no vividness on the right.

1331
00:52:39.254 --> 00:52:40.383
When they switched.

1332
00:52:40.383 --> 00:52:44.123
<v ->Very interesting, okay, so there's this principle</v>

1333
00:52:44.123 --> 00:52:45.821
that Dr. Ahsen points out,

1334
00:52:45.821 --> 00:52:47.723
it's called the unvividness.

1335
00:52:47.723 --> 00:52:51.725
And it has a significant role to play

1336
00:52:51.725 --> 00:52:53.667
in our imagery.

1337
00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:56.632
It's not that I, I have trouble visualizing,

1338
00:52:56.632 --> 00:52:58.066
you know a lot of people do that to themselves,

1339
00:52:58.066 --> 00:53:00.141
that's not it, I mean obviously you can see your parents

1340
00:53:00.141 --> 00:53:01.201
in front of you,

1341
00:53:01.201 --> 00:53:02.698
and when you make that switch,

1342
00:53:02.698 --> 00:53:04.977
you see there is a natural postion

1343
00:53:04.977 --> 00:53:06.647
that you have them in,

1344
00:53:06.647 --> 00:53:11.544
and that image has a reality and a life to it.

1345
00:53:11.544 --> 00:53:15.071
And we can actually analyze that image

1346
00:53:15.071 --> 00:53:17.721
relative to who, in your childhood,

1347
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:20.154
had the prominent position,

1348
00:53:20.154 --> 00:53:23.030
and when you switch them, all of a sudden, yeah,

1349
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.432
your father could take on a more clear,

1350
00:53:25.432 --> 00:53:27.288
more prominent position.

1351
00:53:28.158 --> 00:53:30.371
So if we, let's try another one,

1352
00:53:30.371 --> 00:53:32.164
it's just quite interesting.

1353
00:53:32.954 --> 00:53:34.585
The idea of,

1354
00:53:35.674 --> 00:53:37.944
smelling the air in the house.

1355
00:53:37.944 --> 00:53:42.002
Imagine your parents smelling the air in the house,

1356
00:53:42.002 --> 00:53:45.253
it might be a sniffing, (sniffing the air)

1357
00:53:46.253 --> 00:53:50.345
or it might be a (deep inhale) long breath in.

1358
00:53:50.955 --> 00:53:52.223
Look at your parents,

1359
00:53:52.223 --> 00:53:53.458
your father smelling the air

1360
00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:54.751
and your mother smelling the air

1361
00:53:54.751 --> 00:53:55.827
and what do you notice?

1362
00:53:55.827 --> 00:53:56.659
<v Voiceover>Mom's sniffing,</v>

1363
00:53:56.659 --> 00:53:58.496
Dad's taking a deeper breath in.

1364
00:53:58.496 --> 00:54:00.431
<v ->Okay, what this image,</v>

1365
00:54:00.431 --> 00:54:02.051
this eidetic is,

1366
00:54:02.051 --> 00:54:04.266
has to do with the general atmosphere

1367
00:54:04.266 --> 00:54:05.705
within the home life.

1368
00:54:05.705 --> 00:54:07.807
Like, the family situation, the atmosphere,

1369
00:54:07.807 --> 00:54:09.438
if your mother is (light sniffing)

1370
00:54:09.438 --> 00:54:10.741
there's something wrong here,

1371
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:12.144
you know, she's trying to find it,

1372
00:54:12.144 --> 00:54:13.348
something is going on.

1373
00:54:13.348 --> 00:54:14.472
<v Voiceover>That would be appropriate,</v>

1374
00:54:14.472 --> 00:54:15.843
my dad was much more relaxed.

1375
00:54:15.843 --> 00:54:18.307
<v ->Yeah, exactly, the father taking a deep breath in</v>

1376
00:54:18.307 --> 00:54:19.279
shows more relaxed.

1377
00:54:19.279 --> 00:54:22.881
Now, a child having that eidetic,

1378
00:54:22.881 --> 00:54:23.986
having that image,

1379
00:54:23.986 --> 00:54:26.357
understands, and it's an intuitive,

1380
00:54:26.357 --> 00:54:28.921
it's a body sensation,

1381
00:54:28.921 --> 00:54:30.429
there's a meaning to that

1382
00:54:30.429 --> 00:54:31.699
that we carry with us,

1383
00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:34.625
and this is a result of the child interacting

1384
00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:36.733
with the parent's histories.

1385
00:54:36.733 --> 00:54:38.635
With who the parents are.

1386
00:54:38.635 --> 00:54:41.660
It's not you coming from the primordial realmless realm

1387
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.311
of pure imagination where anything is possible,

1388
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:46.979
it's like these become fixed images

1389
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:49.782
and understandings about how your world works.

1390
00:54:49.782 --> 00:54:51.684
And ends up informing you,

1391
00:54:51.684 --> 00:54:53.017
for years to come.

1392
00:54:53.017 --> 00:54:56.980
So the real invitation is to come to an awareness

1393
00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.125
of the images that we have.

1394
00:54:59.125 --> 00:55:01.287
To be able to contact that realm

1395
00:55:01.287 --> 00:55:03.161
where the pure imagination is,

1396
00:55:03.161 --> 00:55:06.094
in a quiet place within you,

1397
00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:08.835
allow the image to emerge,

1398
00:55:08.835 --> 00:55:11.230
that you can then follow.

1399
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.860
Allow yourself to follow it,

1400
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.341
it will instruct you in all that you need

1401
00:55:15.341 --> 00:55:17.838
to live the life of fullness

1402
00:55:17.838 --> 00:55:20.478
that's possible for you in this life.

1403
00:55:20.478 --> 00:55:21.616
<v Voiceover>So much more organic,</v>

1404
00:55:21.616 --> 00:55:23.418
so much more beautiful and flowing

1405
00:55:23.418 --> 00:55:25.168
and responsive.

1406
00:55:25.483 --> 00:55:27.880
Well, everybody can get to your website

1407
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.688
by clicking on the link below your face right now,

1408
00:55:30.688 --> 00:55:33.057
and we will, I will suggest to everybody

1409
00:55:33.057 --> 00:55:34.694
that you watch this one a couple of times,

1410
00:55:34.694 --> 00:55:37.363
because there's an awful lot of information embedded here.

1411
00:55:37.363 --> 00:55:39.239
And thank you so much for your time.
