00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.100
<v ->Imagine a place where you could see illness</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.829
in the body and its electrical field before it became

3
00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:08.427
a serious threat to your life or well-being.

4
00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:09.717
That's what Dr. Harry Oldfield

5
00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:12.247
brings to the world of medicine and healing.

6
00:00:12.247 --> 00:00:15.207
His polycontrast interference photography device,

7
00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:18.597
known as PIP, has aided healers and medical doctors alike

8
00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:22.127
in diagnosing illness, mental imbalances, and more.

9
00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:26.287
PIP also allows us to look into an otherwise invisible world

10
00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:28.647
of vibrant, living, dynamic energy

11
00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:31.777
surrounding people, places, plants and animals,

12
00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:34.837
even the mysterious subject of crystal healing.

13
00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:45.955
You were not

14
00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:48.935
your average little bear as a child.

15
00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:50.845
You were asking Grandma some questions

16
00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:53.155
kids at three years old don't normally ask.

17
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:54.355
<v ->That's correct, yes.</v>

18
00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:55.985
<v woman>Can you talk a little bit about how it began,</v>

19
00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:57.395
how your journey began.

20
00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:02.375
<v ->Well, my recollection was of my grandma.</v>

21
00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:05.225
She always thought I was a little bit special.

22
00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.865
I mean, I had two brothers.

23
00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.345
She also thought they were special too.

24
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:12.375
They have gone on to do some great things.

25
00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:20.036
One day she was babysitting, for me.

26
00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:23.177
Actually, I think it's really cruel to sit on babies.

27
00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:24.337
There should be a law against it.

28
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:25.037
<v woman>(laughs) There should be.</v>

29
00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:26.215
<v ->But I survived the sitting.</v>

30
00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:30.615
And she's watching me play in her drawing room.

31
00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:35.985
Through a gap in the curtains, a sunbeam is coming in.

32
00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:37.635
She was explaining.

33
00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:39.345
I can't recollect any of this.

34
00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:41.165
It's her recollection I'm going by.

35
00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.145
And the sunbeam's coming through the curtains,

36
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.845
hitting a spot on the carpet.

37
00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:47.655
I'm putting my finger in the carpet,

38
00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:49.945
looking at the light, crawling around,

39
00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:51.835
all directions around the beam.

40
00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:54.975
And then I stand up and I walk towards the window,

41
00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.195
looking very curious.

42
00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.025
And I start tapping the window.

43
00:01:58.025 --> 00:01:59.825
And then she got concerned,

44
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:03.315
because I started to tap the window quite hard.

45
00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:04.875
She said, "Now, Harold."

46
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.725
She always called me "Harold" if I'd done anything naughty.

47
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:09.245
Because it's normally "Harry," you see.

48
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.745
"Harold, what do you think you're doing, young man."

49
00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:14.335
And apparently I turned to her and said to her,

50
00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:18.915
"Nana, why is it when the light comes through the glass,

51
00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:20.515
"it doesn't break."

52
00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:23.565
<v woman>Good question from a three-year-old.</v>

53
00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:25.615
And I bet she didn't have the answer, did she?

54
00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:26.976
<v ->Apparently, a week or so before,</v>

55
00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:29.476
I'd been playing in the garden with little stones.

56
00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:31.156
And I'd broken a window pane

57
00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:34.056
by watching a stone go through, obviously, glass.

58
00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:36.946
I remembered the experience of the stone

59
00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:38.926
going through the glass and breaking it.

60
00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:41.676
But seeing this beam of light coming through,

61
00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:45.487
and to have that kind of thought process.

62
00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:47.445
She thought it was rather special for a three-year-old.

63
00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:48.645
<v woman>Yes. Well I would say.</v>

64
00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:50.675
<v ->Then she started to nurture me.</v>

65
00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.095
<v woman>She started nurturing you, and you were nurtured,</v>

66
00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:55.935
and your curiosity was fostered.

67
00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:57.505
And by the way, we're out here among

68
00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:59.605
the clearing of the breakfast crowd.

69
00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:01.975
And just in case anyone sees it, it's a beautiful day.

70
00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:04.015
And there's a little squirrel that's in love with you.

71
00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.705
And you're not even bribing him with sunflower seeds.

72
00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:08.515
<v ->No. No. It could be a female squirrel.</v>

73
00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:09.795
<v woman>It could be! (laughs)</v>

74
00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.555
If any of you see a busy little tail

75
00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:13.155
popping up over the shoulder.

76
00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:15.255
<v ->She's taken, or he's taken a liking to me.</v>

77
00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:17.245
And I've got nothing here to bribe him with.

78
00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:18.535
<v woman>No, you don't. (laughs)</v>

79
00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:22.185
Okay. So as you move through into your curiosity,

80
00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.685
you end up in the world of science, hard-core science.

81
00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:26.055
<v ->I did indeed.</v>

82
00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:27.805
Before that, though, there was an incident

83
00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:31.515
when I was 11, 12 years old,

84
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:36.265
where my parents suddenly got through a 100-pound check.

85
00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:40.975
Now we are talking like early '60s.

86
00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:43.265
Yeah, early '60s.

87
00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:48.265
And that is like, equivalent of what would be $1,000 today.

88
00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:49.695
A thousand pounds, or something like this.

89
00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:53.445
Made out to Harry Oldfield, you know.

90
00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:54.955
And my father and mother are astonished.

91
00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:56.595
"What have you been doing, Harry?"

92
00:03:56.595 --> 00:04:00.885
This is where from? A fish food company

93
00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:03.975
that make goldfish flakes, that kind of thing.

94
00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:06.775
In the letter, they said,

95
00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:10.365
"Thank you very much for your presentation of your research.

96
00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:12.745
"We are very interested.

97
00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:14.915
"And here is a hundred pounds

98
00:04:14.915 --> 00:04:17.455
"for your time and trouble, young man.

99
00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:18.995
"Thank you very much."

100
00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:22.505
Now, I was able to take my family on a holiday

101
00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:24.925
that summer with that money and everything.

102
00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:26.355
They opened up a little bank account for me.

103
00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:27.515
I'm 12 years old.

104
00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:29.095
Barclays, I remember it very well.

105
00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:30.205
Why shouldn't I advertise?

106
00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:32.756
I've still stuck with Barclays all these years, actually.

107
00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:34.336
From that incident.

108
00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:39.336
The thing was, that company went on to make shrimps

109
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.246
into freeze-dried.

110
00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:45.796
I had invented a way of growing these shrimps

111
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.637
to full size in captivity,

112
00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:51.707
with a special formula.

113
00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:55.637
In my first microscope, I looked at their mouth size,

114
00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:58.965
and I knew they ate algae, green little plants.

115
00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.165
And I found a substitute for their mouth size

116
00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:03.675
that they could possibly eat,

117
00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:05.485
which was yeast, Brugge yeast.

118
00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:07.895
And I put this in their growing water.

119
00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:11.105
And they grew to full-size shrimps.

120
00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:13.465
On a byproduct of beer.

121
00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:15.325
And some of them looked very happy indeed.

122
00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:17.285
We're Brits, you know.

123
00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:19.045
<v woman>Brits, of course.</v>

124
00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:20.035
<v ->Quite, from the beer.</v>

125
00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:22.515
Ours is a little bit warmer than yours.

126
00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:24.165
<v woman>Well, that's your social structure, isn't it?</v>

127
00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:25.825
<v ->It is a social structure.</v>

128
00:05:26.405 --> 00:05:29.485
<v woman>Did your parents know about this experiment?</v>

129
00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.455
<v ->Well, they noticed a lot of jars</v>

130
00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:33.175
on their window sills, as usual.

131
00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:36.335
There was an incident where

132
00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:39.895
I was hatching out stick insects.

133
00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:41.185
And I had all these eggs.

134
00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:45.645
As the stick insects laid the eggs,

135
00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.665
I was putting them in there and covered the hatch.

136
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.205
And I spilled some of the eggs

137
00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:52.395
and they went down in the cracks.

138
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:53.635
And I forgot about them.

139
00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:56.335
Three months later, there's screams from my mother.

140
00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:57.945
And she's pulling stick insects

141
00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:00.275
out of her laundered underwear.

142
00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:03.305
<v woman>Oh no! Okay, so they were used to you.</v>

143
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:05.755
They were used to you by this time.

144
00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:07.985
And now it's paying off.

145
00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:09.605
<v ->I was looked upon even eccentric by my parents.</v>

146
00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:13.355
<v woman>(laughs) I bet you were. And today? Okay?</v>

147
00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:20.015
<v ->Probably looked upon in the same way by my family members,</v>

148
00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:22.305
but in a nice respectful way.

149
00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:26.515
<v woman>Yes. As you moved into your studies</v>

150
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:28.335
and then decided to pursue biology,

151
00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:29.165
which is not a surprise

152
00:06:29.165 --> 00:06:30.885
considering the things you've already told us,

153
00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:34.195
how was your mind structured at that time?

154
00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:36.445
Were you always trying to go outside of the box?

155
00:06:36.445 --> 00:06:38.215
Or were you trying to discipline it

156
00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:41.416
in the classic sciences moreso.

157
00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:45.105
<v ->I was always, shall we say, respectful</v>

158
00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.445
of the discipline of science, you know,

159
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:51.675
and the protocols that you followed.

160
00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:54.695
And how to evaluate information.

161
00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.925
How to structure your ideas.

162
00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:00.495
And this was an absolute fantastic way

163
00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:05.036
of disciplining what was a very very active young mind.

164
00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:06.945
I'm speaking to me in the third person.

165
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:07.665
As a child.

166
00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:08.927
I don't know if I would have wanted

167
00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.977
to have been my father. (laughs)

168
00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:13.617
Because, you know, he had infinite patience.

169
00:07:14.817 --> 00:07:16.867
He was a London bus driver.

170
00:07:18.947 --> 00:07:23.239
And I was the first of his family to ever go to university.

171
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.748
Later, my brothers followed, of course.

172
00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:31.878
It was a very special responsibility, so I did a good job.

173
00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:34.278
To make him proud. And my mother, of course.

174
00:07:34.658 --> 00:07:36.598
<v woman>And how long after that did you start</v>

175
00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:39.127
splititng away from what you had traditionally been taught,

176
00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:40.707
and going into these realms you're in now,

177
00:07:40.707 --> 00:07:41.817
which are so profound?

178
00:07:41.817 --> 00:07:44.657
<v ->I went into science teaching after my degree</v>

179
00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:47.848
for a short time period.

180
00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.844
I was always, in the equivalent of your high school,

181
00:07:53.844 --> 00:07:57.132
I was even called the "mad prof," even in them days,

182
00:07:57.132 --> 00:07:59.192
by the students.

183
00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:02.794
There was a little incident

184
00:08:02.794 --> 00:08:05.304
where I blew up a science laboratory one day.

185
00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:08.484
Which, actually, the local school and government

186
00:08:08.484 --> 00:08:10.384
forgave me for, because it was a total accident.

187
00:08:10.384 --> 00:08:12.455
But I did blow up the laboratory.

188
00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:15.265
My reputation was set with these young kids.

189
00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:16.635
They were fighting to

190
00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:17.895
<v Harry>get on my course.</v>
<v ->I bet they were!</v>

191
00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:21.215
<v ->for their studies in science.</v>

192
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:24.745
I tried to make science alive for them.

193
00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:28.385
And for them to love it as much as I loved it.

194
00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:31.075
And I think I managed for quite a while.

195
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:32.935
And I was always trying to do

196
00:08:32.935 --> 00:08:35.255
these extracurricular activities after school.

197
00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.345
I formed a science club.

198
00:08:37.345 --> 00:08:40.255
Where children who would normally

199
00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:41.475
wait for their parents to come home

200
00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:43.785
or they're gonna take me away me in something led,

201
00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:47.435
they'd come to the science club.

202
00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:49.475
And I would not only

203
00:08:49.475 --> 00:08:51.215
just help them with their science homework,

204
00:08:51.215 --> 00:08:53.948
but also introduce them to things that were a little bit

205
00:08:53.948 --> 00:08:55.457
off the curriculum.

206
00:08:55.457 --> 00:08:57.237
And I introduced them to a subject called

207
00:08:57.237 --> 00:08:59.267
Kirlian photography.

208
00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:01.877
And it was, shall we say, opening for me

209
00:09:01.877 --> 00:09:04.559
that has brought me to here today, really.

210
00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:07.227
And it started with Kirlian photography.

211
00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:08.431
And I must give credit

212
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:10.351
to Semyon and Valentina Kirlian,

213
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:11.641
from the Ukraine,

214
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:13.281
who were the inventors of the system.

215
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.191
Now some people say that before them,

216
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:17.361
Tesla had noticed the effect,

217
00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:19.041
and we must give credit there too.

218
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:22.741
But anyway, Kirlian photography is a high-voltage,

219
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.221
high-frequency system

220
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:29.901
which can take electrical pictures of any object.

221
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:32.822
And you can see a field around it.

222
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:37.132
In fact, Semyon Kirlian was an electrical engineer.

223
00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:39.442
And he was asked to service

224
00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:41.822
some high-voltage electricity in Russia.

225
00:09:41.822 --> 00:09:46.102
And his hands strayed into the field of a transformer

226
00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:47.662
that should have been switched off.

227
00:09:47.662 --> 00:09:50.162
And he noticed a glow around his hands.

228
00:09:50.162 --> 00:09:53.212
And he was just fascinated by this effect.

229
00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:57.212
And he made a home device.

230
00:09:57.212 --> 00:10:00.592
And from that time, their legend was set in motion.

231
00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:02.602
And I made a little device.

232
00:10:03.952 --> 00:10:05.262
I must mention a book.

233
00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:09.512
It can still be got, I believe, on the Internet.

234
00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:13.622
It's called Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain.

235
00:10:13.622 --> 00:10:16.122
By Ostrander and Schroeder. A classic.

236
00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:18.872
And it brought Kirlian photography

237
00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:20.572
for the first time to the West.

238
00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:23.032
There were schematic diagrams in the back of the book

239
00:10:23.032 --> 00:10:24.342
that any scientist

240
00:10:24.342 --> 00:10:27.252
or someone with engineering skills could follow.

241
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.363
I set up a Kirlian camera

242
00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:32.762
for the kids' curiosity, mainly, and mine.

243
00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:34.992
And we started with a phantom-leaf effect.

244
00:10:35.982 --> 00:10:37.969
There's a phenomenal effect.

245
00:10:37.969 --> 00:10:40.168
I showed them in my presentation yesterday.

246
00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:43.640
Where you can remove leaves from a plant

247
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.799
I've discovered that should be organically grown.

248
00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:51.031
You can see, where you've removed the leaves,

249
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:55.747
the phantom image of where the physical leaf was.

250
00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:59.215
And I believe, and the Kirlians believed,

251
00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:02.914
that there was some kind of subatomic energy field matrix

252
00:11:02.914 --> 00:11:06.214
on which the physical molecules were formed.

253
00:11:06.214 --> 00:11:10.854
I later took it further, with my PIP system.

254
00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:14.115
Which is the development, all those years ago,

255
00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:15.105
of Kirlian photography.

256
00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:16.565
But now it's computer-based.

257
00:11:16.565 --> 00:11:19.605
Instead of using electrons and electric fields,

258
00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:25.675
it uses light, photons, to show the effect.

259
00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:28.385
But basically, I've even been able to show phantom limbs.

260
00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:29.885
<v woman>I was just going to ask you about phantom limbs.</v>

261
00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:32.945
<v ->Arms and things, of human beings, of course.</v>

262
00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:34.755
<v woman>Well, in fact, some of what you show</v>

263
00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.495
is truly stunning.

264
00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:37.246
<v ->Thank you.</v>

265
00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:40.865
<v woman>I'm so grateful to be sitting here with you,</v>

266
00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:44.644
because this is the real bridge between the worlds.

267
00:11:44.644 --> 00:11:46.375
The people that say "Show me."

268
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.784
Seeing is believing.

269
00:11:47.784 --> 00:11:49.984
The world of energy, the world of thought.

270
00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:51.904
<v ->I've been through a stage in my development</v>

271
00:11:51.904 --> 00:11:54.225
when I was at university,

272
00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:58.765
shall we say, embracing the scientific logic,

273
00:11:58.765 --> 00:12:00.445
of going through that phase.

274
00:12:00.445 --> 00:12:04.465
Where I dismissed things that were interesting,

275
00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:06.185
like the psyche and the paranormal.

276
00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:10.845
Because the reproducability was a problem.

277
00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:18.084
That little squirrel that was here eariler.

278
00:12:18.084 --> 00:12:21.203
If you put him in a Faraday cage,

279
00:12:21.203 --> 00:12:24.433
all screened and wired up to electrodes and things,

280
00:12:24.433 --> 00:12:27.174
and asked him, like he's just normal,

281
00:12:27.174 --> 00:12:30.504
to repeat his behavior, repeat the experiment,

282
00:12:30.504 --> 00:12:32.680
it would be impossible for him to do.

283
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.460
And that is a characteristic of nature. You know?

284
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.740
And we human beings are putting things

285
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.360
into test tubes and Petri dishes

286
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.500
for reproducability and everything.

287
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.350
But that's not how nature does it.

288
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.010
And this has taken me all these years to get back

289
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.890
to the way nature thinks.

290
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.440
God created nature, in my opinion, of course.

291
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.710
<v woman>Yes. And so you're now showing all of the elements</v>

292
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.962
of nature that are normally veiled from the human eye.

293
00:13:00.962 --> 00:13:03.452
Because we're not able yet to see into these subtle realms.

294
00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:07.532
Can you personally see into this other realm?

295
00:13:07.532 --> 00:13:08.462
<v ->No. No, I can't.</v>

296
00:13:08.462 --> 00:13:09.522
<v woman>Just your equipment sees.</v>

297
00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:11.492
<v ->I have been blessed with that,</v>

298
00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:13.762
as one clairvoyant mystic told me.

299
00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:15.312
She said, "Do you know, Harry,

300
00:13:15.312 --> 00:13:16.725
"if you'd been given my gift,

301
00:13:16.725 --> 00:13:18.393
"you probably wouldn't have made

302
00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:20.313
"any kind of apparatus at all."

303
00:13:20.313 --> 00:13:20.863
<v woman>So true.</v>

304
00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:22.793
<v ->I would have sat back on my laurels</v>

305
00:13:22.793 --> 00:13:24.183
and been quite satisfied with the auras

306
00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.433
I'd see around people.

307
00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:28.282
And the energy from my food

308
00:13:29.182 --> 00:13:33.872
and the specter walking down the castle wall or whatever.

309
00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:35.713
And I would have been happy with and satisfied,

310
00:13:35.713 --> 00:13:36.773
because I've got that ability.

311
00:13:36.773 --> 00:13:37.744
<v woman>How true.</v>

312
00:13:37.744 --> 00:13:39.962
<v ->But I haven't. But I knew other people had.</v>

313
00:13:40.432 --> 00:13:44.172
So I got modern technology to a state

314
00:13:44.172 --> 00:13:46.892
where it could photograph that.

315
00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.582
It could record it.

316
00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:56.222
I was in Gettysburg last year.

317
00:13:56.612 --> 00:13:58.442
Probably if I went back to Gettysburg again,

318
00:13:58.442 --> 00:14:01.362
I wouldn't be able to record exactly the same phenomena.

319
00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:04.162
But it will record phenomena.

320
00:14:04.162 --> 00:14:05.982
<v woman>And will you talk about Gettysburg for a moment?</v>

321
00:14:05.982 --> 00:14:07.382
<v ->I would be delighted.</v>

322
00:14:07.382 --> 00:14:08.812
In fact, I'm hoping

323
00:14:08.812 --> 00:14:12.102
I went, by the way, with the invite of Dr. Brian Dailey

324
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.412
who I believe you might be speaking to later,

325
00:14:14.412 --> 00:14:17.362
who was my co-presenter here at ISIMS.

326
00:14:17.362 --> 00:14:21.222
And Dr. Dailey is the most wonderful physican.

327
00:14:21.222 --> 00:14:26.172
In fact, he won the top physician award

328
00:14:26.172 --> 00:14:29.232
of the United States, two years running, I believe.

329
00:14:29.232 --> 00:14:32.392
And that's the caliber of scientist I'm working with

330
00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:34.302
here in the United States,

331
00:14:34.302 --> 00:14:36.782
which I'm greatly privileged to be doing.

332
00:14:36.782 --> 00:14:37.752
<v woman>Talk about what happened</v>

333
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.342
when you went to Gettysburg.

334
00:14:39.342 --> 00:14:40.242
<v ->Certainly.</v>

335
00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:44.885
Well, we decided that we would

336
00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.535
go to some of the old battlefield sites, obviously.

337
00:14:49.415 --> 00:14:51.625
We were panning around with our equipment.

338
00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:54.405
And I caught on film

339
00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:58.635
what looks like a soldier holding a rifle,

340
00:14:58.635 --> 00:15:03.245
in what looks like a uniform of that time period.

341
00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:05.595
We also got near a barn,

342
00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:09.135
which was supposed to have been a Union hospital

343
00:15:09.135 --> 00:15:13.255
at the time of Gettysburg's battle,

344
00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:16.895
used as an emergency hospital.

345
00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:20.715
And we saw two soldier figures in their hats

346
00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.495
near that particular structure.

347
00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:28.155
And it was quite fascinating.

348
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:29.565
<v woman>Absolutely.</v>

349
00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:32.425
In fact, this is another area that

350
00:15:32.425 --> 00:15:35.304
has always been a great mystery to humankind.

351
00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:36.704
Well, it has been in more recent times,

352
00:15:36.704 --> 00:15:38.763
where we've become more disconnected with the truth.

353
00:15:38.763 --> 00:15:41.033
And that is the whole subject of life after life

354
00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:42.903
and what are we?

355
00:15:42.903 --> 00:15:44.830
And the notion of a soul

356
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.670
or an astral body or a subtle field.

357
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.400
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

358
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.560
If we're going back to Kirlian and PIP

359
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.530
and everything else that shows up energy.

360
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.390
If we are energy beings, you know,

361
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.630
and energy can neither be created nor destroyed,

362
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.237
when this mortal coil is shed,

363
00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:05.437
the physical mortal coils go,

364
00:16:05.437 --> 00:16:07.237
there is energy that is left.

365
00:16:07.857 --> 00:16:11.697
And if we have something called conscious coherence,

366
00:16:11.697 --> 00:16:14.218
which most of us have, hopefully, in life,

367
00:16:14.218 --> 00:16:16.318
that should continue.

368
00:16:16.318 --> 00:16:18.607
I'm of the vein of scientists

369
00:16:18.607 --> 00:16:19.668
who believe in something called

370
00:16:19.668 --> 00:16:23.138
the mind-brain non-locality theory.

371
00:16:23.138 --> 00:16:27.288
In which, although mind does work through the brain,

372
00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:31.428
it sometimes works when the brain is shut off,

373
00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:34.328
like with an anesthetic or near-death experiences,

374
00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:36.498
when the brain was not physically functioning.

375
00:16:36.498 --> 00:16:40.958
Yet consciousness was there and recalled later

376
00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:45.118
on recovery of that said human being from their experience.

377
00:16:45.118 --> 00:16:46.868
<v woman>And with your equipment, you're able</v>

378
00:16:46.868 --> 00:16:48.668
to substantiate or validate this,

379
00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:50.888
because you can actually see the energy flows.

380
00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.598
<v ->Very much so.</v>

381
00:16:52.598 --> 00:16:53.968
<v woman>Around the body.</v>

382
00:16:53.968 --> 00:16:57.148
<v ->Perhaps I should cite here the most mysterious of this,</v>

383
00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:59.208
was when I did work in a morgue,

384
00:16:59.698 --> 00:17:01.388
in the Mediterranean.

385
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:04.178
And I was called in by the chief pathologist.

386
00:17:04.178 --> 00:17:05.498
And I thought it was most unusual.

387
00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:07.028
Heard of my work, I was in the country.

388
00:17:07.028 --> 00:17:09.908
And he said, "Would you mind coming

389
00:17:09.908 --> 00:17:13.168
"to my establishment and using your apparatus

390
00:17:13.168 --> 00:17:15.428
"to scan round and look for anomalies?"

391
00:17:15.428 --> 00:17:17.590
I said, well this is a very open-minded scientist.

392
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.470
I asked him on the phone, I said,

393
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.111
"Thank you, professor.

394
00:17:21.111 --> 00:17:24.790
"But may I say, what made you think of this?

395
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.162
"Why am I to do it?"

396
00:17:26.162 --> 00:17:27.970
He said, "Because of an experience I had

397
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:28.940
"some years ago."

398
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.400
He was working on an autopsy of a young girl,

399
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.200
an unfortunate victim of a road traffic accident.

400
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.680
And he worked to the early hours of the morning,

401
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.840
so that the report could be in for the coroner the next day.

402
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.030
I do believe that pathologists do it here

403
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.190
in America too, unfortunately.

404
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.240
Young people who don't wear motorcycle helmets,

405
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.600
please do.

406
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.050
Because there's so many premature deaths

407
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.060
that happen because of it.

408
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.490
I've seen it here in Colorado.

409
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.240
Young people going around with no helmets.

410
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.680
I'm a father, I like to see young people safe.

411
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.660
But anyway, they're very precious.

412
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.800
And this girl, unfortunately, came to an unnatural end.

413
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.100
And he's doing what he's supposed to do with the autopsy.

414
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.200
And suddenly he gets a feeling of being watched.

415
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.010
He knew he was alone in the autopsy room.

416
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.490
He'd sent all his staff home, much earlier.

417
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.529
Because he was the one that works the early hours.

418
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:20.490
And he looked up from what he was doing,

419
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.910
at the foot of the bench.

420
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.170
And there stood a girl, looking horrified.

421
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.740
With a look of horror on her face,

422
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.800
all dressed in white.

423
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.830
And he said, "Your face is familiar."

424
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.470
He thought she had escaped

425
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:33.820
from the adjacent wing of the hospital.

426
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.031
It was a psychiatric wing.

427
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.810
And he thought she was a psych patient,

428
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.910
and that he'd have to call security.

429
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.890
And he suddenly realized,

430
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.500
he looked down at the mortuary table,

431
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.070
and it was the same face.

432
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.680
As he realized that in horror himself,

433
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.170
the girl manifestation disappeared.

434
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.740
<v woman>On the subject of the beingness of our beings,</v>

435
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.570
and being able to validate this with your technology.

436
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.970
You and Dr. Dailey are headed right after this interview

437
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.070
by request of a family to, I assume, take images?

438
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.030
<v ->A comatose patient, yes.</v>

439
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.510
<v woman>Images of the comatose patient</v>

440
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.180
to see whether they've really departed or not.

441
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.840
Can you talk about that phenomenon?

442
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.990
<v ->Obviously, not personally about this particular case.</v>

443
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.850
But in general, with comatose victims,

444
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.771
they are either in a persistent vegetative state,

445
00:19:18.771 --> 00:19:20.311
deep coma,

446
00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:25.052
or they are coming in and out of consciousness.

447
00:19:25.052 --> 00:19:27.531
Now, sometimes, that is the body's way

448
00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:30.431
of recovering from a very deep trauma.

449
00:19:30.431 --> 00:19:34.791
And the mind takes a vacation from the brain and the body

450
00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:37.421
because there's been so much trauma.

451
00:19:37.421 --> 00:19:39.741
There's so much it can take, the nervous system.

452
00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:41.551
So it shuts down for a while.

453
00:19:41.551 --> 00:19:42.491
And then comes back.

454
00:19:42.491 --> 00:19:43.591
And consciousness returns.

455
00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:46.111
And people return, hopefully with all their functions.

456
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:48.941
However, when there has been a lot of damage,

457
00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:53.752
like a very deep stroke or a cardiovascular incident,

458
00:19:55.342 --> 00:19:59.282
or many other things, diabetic shock or whatever,

459
00:20:00.342 --> 00:20:05.042
then the persistence of the coma can go on for months

460
00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:06.442
and sometimes years.

461
00:20:06.442 --> 00:20:08.382
Now, it's been well-recorded

462
00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:11.662
that people have returned from such states

463
00:20:11.662 --> 00:20:14.352
with being played their favorite music,

464
00:20:14.352 --> 00:20:16.062
hearing a loved one's voice

465
00:20:16.062 --> 00:20:18.032
that's brought them back from the brink of death.

466
00:20:18.032 --> 00:20:19.722
And they've come back.

467
00:20:19.732 --> 00:20:22.382
But there's also cases where

468
00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:26.392
such people have been kept alive by machines

469
00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.736
and artificial means

470
00:20:28.736 --> 00:20:33.246
that when the family had to make that terrible decision

471
00:20:33.246 --> 00:20:34.736
of turning off the machine,

472
00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:37.036
and autopsies have been done,

473
00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:40.936
that there is nothing there left of the brain function.

474
00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:46.396
There is now something called brain stem testing,

475
00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:48.936
which is internationally recognized, I believe.

476
00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:51.866
If there's no electrical force coming from there,

477
00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:54.556
there's been no cases ever of anyone recovering

478
00:20:54.556 --> 00:20:58.076
where their brain stem has stopped functioning.

479
00:20:58.076 --> 00:21:00.696
Now, I don't know.

480
00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:02.836
I think the question is,

481
00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:06.188
if the energy is looking more and more

482
00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:09.488
like it's in a quiescent, dead state.

483
00:21:09.488 --> 00:21:12.450
And there's no energy around the proximity

484
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.968
of a comatose victim, then there's a likelihood

485
00:21:16.968 --> 00:21:20.178
that we're only keeping the body functions alive,

486
00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:22.688
and the person is no longer with us.

487
00:21:23.058 --> 00:21:24.938
<v woman>And you can see this</v>

488
00:21:24.938 --> 00:21:26.328
through your technology as well?

489
00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:29.658
<v ->I have observed it before, in previous cases.</v>

490
00:21:29.658 --> 00:21:34.258
But it is not a tried-and-tested means, by any means,

491
00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:35.448
for this kind of thing.

492
00:21:35.448 --> 00:21:39.178
But people with other means,

493
00:21:39.178 --> 00:21:42.398
obviously with medical tests as well,

494
00:21:42.398 --> 00:21:44.588
and my test,

495
00:21:44.588 --> 00:21:46.788
have been helped to formulate,

496
00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:49.138
to help make decisions, difficult decisions.

497
00:21:49.138 --> 00:21:49.998
<v woman>So what would it have looked like?</v>

498
00:21:49.998 --> 00:21:52.168
If the person is still there?

499
00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:53.878
What does that look like?

500
00:21:53.878 --> 00:21:56.971
<v ->Well. The chakra still function, for example.</v>

501
00:21:56.971 --> 00:21:58.901
The meridians are flowing.

502
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:01.421
All this we can actually see.

503
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:05.301
We can look for active acupuncture points.

504
00:22:05.301 --> 00:22:10.241
This I was able to do in mainland China, 2001.

505
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.241
When I was out there.

506
00:22:11.241 --> 00:22:12.181
<v woman>Yes, I wanted to get to that.</v>

507
00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:13.821
<v ->I have visiting professor of medicine status</v>

508
00:22:13.821 --> 00:22:15.771
for that wonderful country.

509
00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:17.911
And it was wonderful in China,

510
00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:21.391
because we both had traditional doctors

511
00:22:21.391 --> 00:22:23.206
and doctors that were also trained

512
00:22:23.206 --> 00:22:25.636
in their traditional medicine,

513
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:28.968
who were coming up to congratulate me

514
00:22:28.968 --> 00:22:31.106
and saying they were seeing for the first time

515
00:22:31.106 --> 00:22:33.726
things they'd only seen in their books

516
00:22:34.346 --> 00:22:37.856
of acupuncture, meridians,

517
00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:42.426
and the flow of what they called the qi or the life force,

518
00:22:42.426 --> 00:22:44.966
through these points.

519
00:22:44.966 --> 00:22:46.828
<v woman>Your images are absolutely amazing,</v>

520
00:22:46.828 --> 00:22:48.556
showing the energy flowing.

521
00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:49.506
<v ->Yes indeed.</v>

522
00:22:50.216 --> 00:22:54.907
I feel that we have validated the understandings

523
00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:57.107
and the knowledge of these ancient peoples

524
00:22:57.107 --> 00:22:58.847
from China and India.

525
00:22:59.397 --> 00:23:00.927
Because we see the chakras too.

526
00:23:01.407 --> 00:23:03.567
They work together in this.

527
00:23:03.567 --> 00:23:06.387
And with those two ancient peoples,

528
00:23:06.997 --> 00:23:09.177
who thousands of years ago discovered,

529
00:23:09.177 --> 00:23:11.468
observed these forces within us.

530
00:23:11.468 --> 00:23:13.798
Man hasn't changed very much since that time.

531
00:23:13.798 --> 00:23:16.127
Apart from pollution of the planet,

532
00:23:16.127 --> 00:23:19.106
and perhaps pollution of himself

533
00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:21.276
with negative things around him.

534
00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:24.276
<v woman>And you can actually watch</v>

535
00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:26.277
the vital flow through the body.

536
00:23:26.277 --> 00:23:27.777
<v ->In real time.</v>

537
00:23:27.777 --> 00:23:29.947
<v woman>And yesterday I was watching you in real time.</v>

538
00:23:29.947 --> 00:23:32.686
And you had Dr. Dailey using his amazing abilities

539
00:23:32.686 --> 00:23:35.966
as a Reiki master as well as being an MD,

540
00:23:35.966 --> 00:23:38.346
working on somebody who had been out of balance

541
00:23:38.346 --> 00:23:40.036
or in pain, in fact a few of them.

542
00:23:40.036 --> 00:23:42.066
And you can watch, through your technology,

543
00:23:42.066 --> 00:23:45.568
the bodies actually coming back into harmony and balance.

544
00:23:45.568 --> 00:23:48.428
<v ->I've seen it hundreds and hundreds of times.</v>

545
00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:50.056
But I never take it for granted.

546
00:23:50.056 --> 00:23:52.046
It's a wonderful thing to observe.

547
00:23:52.046 --> 00:23:55.977
Where, we talk about harmony and balance of energy,

548
00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:58.786
but to actually see it occur,

549
00:23:58.786 --> 00:24:00.756
from a disharmonious state,

550
00:24:00.756 --> 00:24:04.216
or can I use the classic word of "disease,"

551
00:24:04.216 --> 00:24:06.116
as opposed to ease.

552
00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:09.936
"Disease" is a word that "means out of balance."

553
00:24:09.936 --> 00:24:13.846
And originally, in ancient times, it meant out of humor,

554
00:24:13.846 --> 00:24:15.756
out of balance with one's energies

555
00:24:15.756 --> 00:24:18.156
and one's components.

556
00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:21.046
And when you're in-ease, you're in balance.

557
00:24:21.046 --> 00:24:25.616
Any good physician doctors, therapist,

558
00:24:25.616 --> 00:24:27.737
is always trying to do, healer,

559
00:24:27.737 --> 00:24:30.537
is to get someone back to their normal balance.

560
00:24:30.537 --> 00:24:32.697
And that is what we want to achieve.

561
00:24:32.697 --> 00:24:35.797
<v woman>And it's amazing how subtle energies</v>

562
00:24:35.797 --> 00:24:38.416
really put it there so much faster than anything else.

563
00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:39.126
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

564
00:24:39.126 --> 00:24:41.616
<v woman>Rather than blasting it with pharmaceutical drugs</v>

565
00:24:41.616 --> 00:24:42.496
and the like.

566
00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:46.186
<v ->When it comes to even, shall we say,</v>

567
00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:49.817
some of the very prominent pharmaceutical agents

568
00:24:49.817 --> 00:24:51.207
we use in society,

569
00:24:51.207 --> 00:24:52.987
there's an energy component to them as well.

570
00:24:52.987 --> 00:24:57.467
And I feel, as a scientist, that if we looked

571
00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:58.979
at the energy components,

572
00:24:58.979 --> 00:25:01.899
rather than just the chemical reactions,

573
00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:04.859
we'd get more insight into making drugs safer.

574
00:25:05.489 --> 00:25:07.859
<v woman>Give us an example of exactly that.</v>

575
00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:12.019
<v ->Well, for example, I did an experiment</v>

576
00:25:12.019 --> 00:25:15.479
where if you use aspirin,

577
00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:18.880
salicylic acid to scientists, okay.

578
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.499
And you give it to a human being, okay.

579
00:25:20.499 --> 00:25:22.639
You'll see an energy irritation

580
00:25:22.639 --> 00:25:24.839
that suddenly appears in the stomach area.

581
00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:26.789
Especially on an empty stomach, okay.

582
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:28.309
Don't take aspirin on an empty stomach.

583
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:33.092
Yet it's a very, very useful agent.

584
00:25:33.092 --> 00:25:35.762
And it's been used by householders,

585
00:25:35.762 --> 00:25:40.002
ordinary people, for the last over a half-century,

586
00:25:40.002 --> 00:25:41.462
probably longer.

587
00:25:42.072 --> 00:25:45.062
But if you put just an aspirin

588
00:25:45.062 --> 00:25:48.382
near the energy of a cat, a feline.

589
00:25:49.192 --> 00:25:51.902
Do not get the cat to eat the aspirin, okay.

590
00:25:51.902 --> 00:25:53.822
Just get it near the energy of a cat.

591
00:25:53.822 --> 00:25:55.692
The energy of the cat goes haywire.

592
00:25:55.692 --> 00:25:58.932
Cats cannot tolerate salicylic acid.

593
00:25:59.652 --> 00:26:01.561
If they ingest it, it will kill them.

594
00:26:02.261 --> 00:26:04.291
So if you ever think your cat's got a headache,

595
00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:05.341
don't give it aspirin.

596
00:26:05.341 --> 00:26:07.061
You go to your veterinary practitioner

597
00:26:07.061 --> 00:26:08.901
and get the right thing it needs.

598
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.931
<v woman>Interesting.</v>

599
00:26:09.931 --> 00:26:11.891
<v ->That's just an example.</v>

600
00:26:11.891 --> 00:26:13.611
<v woman>Have you by any chance watched</v>

601
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:16.591
any other chemical interactions in human beings

602
00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:18.171
with certain types of drugs,

603
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.101
whether they were legal or illegal?

604
00:26:21.571 --> 00:26:24.141
<v ->I did yesterday, in my presentation, show</v>

605
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:27.656
a very distressing study, picture study,

606
00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:29.266
of a crack cocaine addict.

607
00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:30.006
<v woman>I saw that.</v>

608
00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:31.506
<v ->A 15-year-old girl.</v>

609
00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:34.546
And this is just typical of what I've seen

610
00:26:34.546 --> 00:26:37.846
of this terrible, terrible affliction.

611
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:40.156
I don't want to call it even an addiction

612
00:26:40.156 --> 00:26:41.706
and make it respectable.

613
00:26:41.706 --> 00:26:44.277
It's an affliction that's put on young people

614
00:26:44.277 --> 00:26:46.285
by most immoral means

615
00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:49.585
of base society.

616
00:26:50.935 --> 00:26:54.328
It literally rips open their energy fields.

617
00:26:54.328 --> 00:26:55.518
Especially at the top of the head.

618
00:26:55.518 --> 00:26:56.868
There's kundalini imbalance,

619
00:26:56.868 --> 00:26:58.208
which is at the base of the spine.

620
00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:01.078
Their sexual energy is completely disorientated.

621
00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:04.508
Their brow chakras are opened,

622
00:27:04.508 --> 00:27:06.178
and they will hallucinate.

623
00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:08.808
They will actually see things in those other dimensions.

624
00:27:08.808 --> 00:27:10.088
Which of course are put down to

625
00:27:10.088 --> 00:27:12.998
paranoid delusion, and psychotic behavior

626
00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:14.868
by modern society.

627
00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:16.208
But they're actually being opened

628
00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:18.978
artificially to these other dimensions.

629
00:27:18.978 --> 00:27:20.598
And they don't have the mentality

630
00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:22.388
to understand what they're seeing.

631
00:27:22.928 --> 00:27:25.118
I had a 15-year-old, for example,

632
00:27:25.118 --> 00:27:27.058
who said, "These voices tell me,

633
00:27:27.058 --> 00:27:31.788
"Dr. Oldfield, to kill my parents,

634
00:27:31.788 --> 00:27:33.228
"and to get their money,

635
00:27:33.228 --> 00:27:35.288
"so I can get more of my white rocks."

636
00:27:36.608 --> 00:27:41.338
And it was very very, well, disconcerting to me,

637
00:27:41.338 --> 00:27:43.118
but tragic to her family

638
00:27:43.118 --> 00:27:44.608
to be going through that experience.

639
00:27:44.608 --> 00:27:47.168
<v woman>And they actually are opening to other beings.</v>

640
00:27:47.168 --> 00:27:49.238
You can see the other beings as well?

641
00:27:49.238 --> 00:27:50.248
<v ->We have seen these attachments.</v>

642
00:27:50.248 --> 00:27:51.738
We have seen these forms.

643
00:27:51.738 --> 00:27:55.648
Not around everyone, shall we say,

644
00:27:55.648 --> 00:27:58.298
who's been addicted to certain substances.

645
00:27:58.298 --> 00:28:01.718
But certainly the hallucinogenic,

646
00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:06.968
morphic type drugs

647
00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:10.228
are profound for opening one up

648
00:28:10.228 --> 00:28:11.988
to those other levels.

649
00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:15.208
<v woman>And once this happens,</v>

650
00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:18.818
have you ever seen anything on a continued basis,

651
00:28:18.818 --> 00:28:20.448
once these beings are opened

652
00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:22.398
to these other entities or attachments?

653
00:28:22.398 --> 00:28:24.498
What does it take then to repair the field?

654
00:28:24.498 --> 00:28:25.628
From your observations?

655
00:28:25.628 --> 00:28:27.028
<v ->If they're cooperative,</v>

656
00:28:27.028 --> 00:28:28.158
and this is not always the case,

657
00:28:28.158 --> 00:28:29.878
if they're still in the family unit,

658
00:28:29.878 --> 00:28:31.968
which is also not always the case,

659
00:28:31.968 --> 00:28:35.658
I've been successful in closing down these energy gaps,

660
00:28:35.658 --> 00:28:39.798
these energy rips, lesions, if you like.

661
00:28:39.798 --> 00:28:41.758
And sealing the energy field,

662
00:28:41.758 --> 00:28:44.178
controlling the abused substance,

663
00:28:44.178 --> 00:28:47.008
under medical supervision, of course,

664
00:28:48.388 --> 00:28:50.068
with substitutes.

665
00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:53.998
Then we are able to call it a successful case.

666
00:28:53.998 --> 00:28:56.808
But the psychological damage

667
00:28:56.808 --> 00:28:59.198
can be very much more long-lasting.

668
00:28:59.198 --> 00:29:01.278
And to other family members too.

669
00:29:01.278 --> 00:29:03.218
And to spouses and partners.

670
00:29:05.298 --> 00:29:07.658
<v woman>Let's compare that, for example.</v>

671
00:29:07.658 --> 00:29:10.368
You had, I believe, a rinpoche.

672
00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:13.588
<v ->Oh, indeed, Lama Rinpoche, Tibetan priest.</v>

673
00:29:13.588 --> 00:29:14.938
<v woman>Can you talk about the differences</v>

674
00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:15.678
in the aura.

675
00:29:15.688 --> 00:29:17.458
<v ->His energy was so magnificent.</v>

676
00:29:18.658 --> 00:29:21.357
Rainbow-colored, bright,

677
00:29:22.477 --> 00:29:25.998
as opposed to dark and sinister

678
00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:28.768
from the cocaine addicts.

679
00:29:29.258 --> 00:29:30.598
<v woman>What has this taught you,</v>

680
00:29:30.598 --> 00:29:33.879
being able to view these kinds of images

681
00:29:33.879 --> 00:29:37.439
in real time, real life, and watch the unseen world

682
00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:38.829
happening all day, every day?

683
00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:41.347
<v ->To me, every day is a privilege, you know.</v>

684
00:29:41.347 --> 00:29:43.889
I thank God that I can still see.

685
00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:46.437
Thank God that I can still breathe

686
00:29:46.437 --> 00:29:48.097
this wonderful air he's given us, you know.

687
00:29:48.097 --> 00:29:50.467
I'm the kind of scientist who,

688
00:29:51.597 --> 00:29:53.109
before he shaves in front of the mirror,

689
00:29:53.109 --> 00:29:55.869
looks at himself and sees those nostrils,

690
00:29:55.869 --> 00:29:57.269
okay, if I may use that term,

691
00:29:57.269 --> 00:30:00.169
and thank God he gave me them.

692
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:01.699
Because I can breathe God's sweet air.

693
00:30:02.439 --> 00:30:05.829
And there's just enough oxygen, it's amazing.

694
00:30:05.829 --> 00:30:08.789
There's just enough oxygen on the planet

695
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:11.519
for us to sustain life.

696
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.669
If there was any more oxygen,

697
00:30:13.429 --> 00:30:15.729
if we lit a match and a fire started,

698
00:30:15.729 --> 00:30:17.139
we could never put it out.

699
00:30:17.939 --> 00:30:19.670
<v ->If there was too little oxygen,</v>

700
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.629
then we couldn't sustain higher life,

701
00:30:22.629 --> 00:30:24.469
like we've got here, now.

702
00:30:24.469 --> 00:30:26.359
I think that is absolutely fantastic.

703
00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:27.529
That balance is there.

704
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:28.669
<v woman>You have photographed</v>

705
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:30.379
some of the most incredible spots.

706
00:30:30.379 --> 00:30:32.171
And let's talk about them a little bit.

707
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:34.419
Some are well known and some are lesser known.

708
00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:36.729
And I'd like you to talk a little bit about Bosnia.

709
00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:37.719
<v ->Indeed.</v>

710
00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:40.750
We were greatly privileged, earlier this year,

711
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.909
to visit, just outside of Sarajevo,

712
00:30:44.649 --> 00:30:46.530
the Bosnian pyramids.

713
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.900
And these are ancient monuments.

714
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.180
The archaeologists are still debating

715
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.610
could still be actually older than

716
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.290
the pyramids of Giza, in Egypt.

717
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.030
And 10,000 years perhaps.

718
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.792
We were there with our special video equipment.

719
00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:11.882
And we were able to see the energies

720
00:31:11.882 --> 00:31:14.192
coming out of the tops of these pyramids.

721
00:31:15.692 --> 00:31:17.596
We were also privileged there

722
00:31:17.596 --> 00:31:20.904
with our German colleagues of the Seraphim Institute

723
00:31:20.904 --> 00:31:24.464
and Dr. Karen Tag.

724
00:31:25.394 --> 00:31:28.664
She was doing experiments with her crystal skull

725
00:31:28.664 --> 00:31:30.004
from South America.

726
00:31:30.354 --> 00:31:32.304
And we were able to see the energy interaction

727
00:31:32.304 --> 00:31:34.424
between this very ancient artefact

728
00:31:34.854 --> 00:31:37.964
and an even more ancient artefact of the pyramid.

729
00:31:39.244 --> 00:31:41.434
There were energy connections,

730
00:31:41.434 --> 00:31:42.844
and it was absolutely fascinating.

731
00:31:42.844 --> 00:31:43.564
<v woman>What did you see?</v>

732
00:31:43.564 --> 00:31:46.764
What kind of emanations were you seeing

733
00:31:46.764 --> 00:31:48.564
from the top of the pyramid?

734
00:31:48.564 --> 00:31:50.004
<v ->Well, we were seeing jet streams</v>

735
00:31:50.004 --> 00:31:51.964
going straight up into the atmosphere.

736
00:31:51.964 --> 00:31:55.524
We were seeing, shall we say, flying anomalies

737
00:31:55.524 --> 00:31:59.454
that were moving around the pyramid.

738
00:31:59.454 --> 00:32:00.834
<v ->Looked like interdimensional?</v>

739
00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:02.364
<v ->They looked interdimensional, UFOs,</v>

740
00:32:02.364 --> 00:32:03.934
whatever you'd like to call them.

741
00:32:03.934 --> 00:32:06.194
I'm still analyzing the film data.

742
00:32:06.194 --> 00:32:08.505
Which was incredible.

743
00:32:08.505 --> 00:32:10.394
<v ->Because a lot of the UFO activity</v>

744
00:32:10.394 --> 00:32:11.644
that happens around here

745
00:32:11.644 --> 00:32:13.424
is not necessarily within this dimension.

746
00:32:13.424 --> 00:32:14.754
<v ->I believe that is the case.</v>

747
00:32:14.754 --> 00:32:16.124
<v ->People who are seers can see it.</v>

748
00:32:16.124 --> 00:32:17.714
I know with Steven Greer's group.

749
00:32:17.714 --> 00:32:19.174
They always have seers on board

750
00:32:19.174 --> 00:32:21.724
who will point out where they are, and so forth.

751
00:32:21.724 --> 00:32:22.994
And they've actually been caught

752
00:32:23.014 --> 00:32:24.974
on digital cameras, right where it's been set.

753
00:32:24.974 --> 00:32:25.624
<v ->Very much so.</v>

754
00:32:25.624 --> 00:32:27.674
I believe, also, they're at such a high frequency,

755
00:32:27.674 --> 00:32:30.105
that to most of our human eyes,

756
00:32:30.105 --> 00:32:32.285
they're cloaked, most of the time.

757
00:32:32.285 --> 00:32:34.404
<v woman>Again, this is just a beautiful example</v>

758
00:32:34.404 --> 00:32:36.134
of how your work is starting to bring

759
00:32:36.134 --> 00:32:37.664
that which has been under debate,

760
00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.854
under much, much more,

761
00:32:39.854 --> 00:32:42.194
closer scrutiny, on one level,

762
00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:43.784
but more acceptance on another.

763
00:32:43.784 --> 00:32:46.155
<v ->This has been the case.</v>

764
00:32:46.155 --> 00:32:48.275
We didn't go out to do this.

765
00:32:48.275 --> 00:32:49.805
It was accidental.

766
00:32:49.805 --> 00:32:53.595
Shall we say, these other flying anomalies,

767
00:32:53.595 --> 00:32:56.265
that we're able to show them.

768
00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:57.443
Normally, I was looking at

769
00:32:57.443 --> 00:33:01.343
meridian and chakra anomalies in people.

770
00:33:01.343 --> 00:33:02.283
That's where it all started,

771
00:33:02.283 --> 00:33:04.133
with the human energy field, of course.

772
00:33:04.133 --> 00:33:05.353
<v ->Let's talk about crystals,</v>

773
00:33:05.353 --> 00:33:07.683
and the human being and healing.

774
00:33:07.683 --> 00:33:10.125
And crystals in and of themselves, this is a big topic.

775
00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:12.275
And it's not just a "woo" thing you sit

776
00:33:12.275 --> 00:33:13.966
in the middle of the table and admire.

777
00:33:13.966 --> 00:33:16.725
<v ->No. They are energy-dynamic.</v>

778
00:33:16.725 --> 00:33:20.715
Science uses them as energy transducers.

779
00:33:20.715 --> 00:33:23.225
There's one going off here in my watch, for example.

780
00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:26.535
In some of the camera equipment, there are crystal markers

781
00:33:26.535 --> 00:33:29.435
that set beat frequencies

782
00:33:29.435 --> 00:33:32.095
for those electronics to work

783
00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:35.655
in a balanced way, in a harmonic way.

784
00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:38.305
All of us use crystals every day

785
00:33:38.305 --> 00:33:39.873
in these electronic objects.

786
00:33:40.843 --> 00:33:43.163
However, crystals have been used

787
00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:45.733
in a more ancient sense, in a healing sense.

788
00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.333
And the natural crystals that come out of the ground

789
00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:51.833
have properties that affect the environment

790
00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:54.643
and properties that affect the human energy system.

791
00:33:54.643 --> 00:33:57.233
<v woman>Can you tell us what you observe?</v>

792
00:33:57.233 --> 00:34:01.383
<v ->Well, I observed this first with Kirlian photography</v>

793
00:34:01.383 --> 00:34:04.873
in the mid-1970s.

794
00:34:06.433 --> 00:34:09.263
I noticed that crystals had a field of their own

795
00:34:09.263 --> 00:34:11.903
that was very similar to a living field.

796
00:34:11.903 --> 00:34:13.393
But I couldn't be sure.

797
00:34:13.393 --> 00:34:15.383
It was only later, with PIP,

798
00:34:15.383 --> 00:34:17.653
polycontrast interference photography,

799
00:34:17.653 --> 00:34:20.543
my other invention that was in the late 80s,

800
00:34:20.543 --> 00:34:22.093
came about first,

801
00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:24.933
that we saw anomalies

802
00:34:24.933 --> 00:34:27.307
coming in and out of the crystals

803
00:34:27.307 --> 00:34:30.567
of energy forms, amorphous energy, amoeboid.

804
00:34:30.567 --> 00:34:32.367
And we have the film footage of all this.

805
00:34:32.367 --> 00:34:34.497
Coming in and out of the crystal.

806
00:34:34.707 --> 00:34:39.417
And they seem to behaving very intelligently.

807
00:34:40.407 --> 00:34:42.437
<v ->So it has its own consciousness.</v>

808
00:34:42.437 --> 00:34:44.417
And if you interface its consciousness

809
00:34:44.417 --> 00:34:45.527
with our consciousness...

810
00:34:45.527 --> 00:34:46.277
<v ->They react.</v>

811
00:34:46.277 --> 00:34:47.277
<v ->They react.</v>

812
00:34:47.277 --> 00:34:49.297
<v ->In the hands of healers, for example.</v>

813
00:34:49.297 --> 00:34:51.637
I had an Icelandic healer.

814
00:34:51.637 --> 00:34:53.427
And he could actually,

815
00:34:54.487 --> 00:34:56.797
In Icelandic they're called stainer fólk.

816
00:34:57.587 --> 00:35:00.437
And these stainer fólk are energies

817
00:35:00.437 --> 00:35:01.877
in the stones and crystals.

818
00:35:01.877 --> 00:35:04.597
And he was able to sort of ask them to come out.

819
00:35:04.597 --> 00:35:06.757
And they could move over the surface of the crystal,

820
00:35:06.757 --> 00:35:08.307
even moved into his arm.

821
00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:09.867
And we have film footage of that.

822
00:35:09.867 --> 00:35:11.287
<v woman>Absolutely fascinating.</v>

823
00:35:11.287 --> 00:35:13.338
In fact, we'll talk to Dr. Dailey a little bit more

824
00:35:13.338 --> 00:35:14.288
about that as well.

825
00:35:14.288 --> 00:35:15.958
<v ->Oh, he's an expert in crystals in his own right.</v>

826
00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:17.928
<v ->He is. He utilizes them for healing.</v>

827
00:35:17.928 --> 00:35:19.778
And to talk also about just the simplicity,

828
00:35:19.778 --> 00:35:22.088
because you're able to capture those images

829
00:35:22.088 --> 00:35:23.158
and decipher them.

830
00:35:23.158 --> 00:35:26.228
And I watched him work with some people yesterday.

831
00:35:26.228 --> 00:35:29.189
And the energies coming from the crystals themselves

832
00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:30.649
is magnificent.

833
00:35:30.649 --> 00:35:32.699
I would think the sooner we can understand

834
00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:34.027
this isn't just woo-woo,

835
00:35:34.667 --> 00:35:36.897
this is a natural phenomenon

836
00:35:36.897 --> 00:35:39.215
that now you're validating scientifically.

837
00:35:39.215 --> 00:35:39.945
<v ->Ancient people knew this.</v>

838
00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:41.665
When they held a stone, they felt something.

839
00:35:41.665 --> 00:35:44.495
They're people still with sensitivity

840
00:35:44.495 --> 00:35:47.055
when they held this crystal, gemstones.

841
00:35:48.555 --> 00:35:52.259
Then it came about that people wanted to adorn themselves,

842
00:35:52.259 --> 00:35:53.570
put them on their bodies

843
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.579
for ceremonial purposes.

844
00:35:55.579 --> 00:35:58.220
Later on, thousands of years later,

845
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.020
hundreds of years later, it got debased.

846
00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.550
In the sense that people just wore them for jewelry

847
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.740
and forgot what the purpose of them was.

848
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.580
It wasn't just for their prettiness, their attractiveness.

849
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.580
They were there to affect an energy state,

850
00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.670
to help keep our energies in balance.

851
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.875
That knowledge got lost.

852
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:22.106
And it's now being rediscovered, I'm pleased to say.

853
00:36:22.106 --> 00:36:23.745
In many places all over the world.

854
00:36:23.745 --> 00:36:24.907
<v woman>Absolutely.</v>

855
00:36:24.907 --> 00:36:26.387
And it works with our consciousness.

856
00:36:26.387 --> 00:36:27.447
With our intention.

857
00:36:27.447 --> 00:36:28.877
<v ->Very much, our conscious intent.</v>

858
00:36:28.877 --> 00:36:30.347
<v ->It's almost as though it's an amplifier, isn't it?</v>

859
00:36:30.347 --> 00:36:31.507
And more.

860
00:36:31.507 --> 00:36:34.078
<v ->An energy amplifier, energy transducer,</v>

861
00:36:34.078 --> 00:36:36.107
that's exactly what I believe the crystals are.

862
00:36:36.107 --> 00:36:37.638
And when you look at a crystal,

863
00:36:37.638 --> 00:36:40.217
you're looking at the most ordered form

864
00:36:40.217 --> 00:36:41.745
of matter in the universe.

865
00:36:41.745 --> 00:36:44.455
Because it's not just the external geometry

866
00:36:44.455 --> 00:36:47.105
that looks nice and straight and balanced.

867
00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:50.455
The internal structure, called a crystal lattice,

868
00:36:50.455 --> 00:36:52.815
is a very ordered structure indeed.

869
00:36:52.815 --> 00:36:57.015
There isn't any other systems

870
00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:58.365
that we know of, in the universe,

871
00:36:58.365 --> 00:36:59.878
that's so ordered

872
00:37:00.948 --> 00:37:05.418
with its internal geometry of atomic structure.

873
00:37:05.418 --> 00:37:07.838
And also, the energy lattice

874
00:37:07.838 --> 00:37:10.450
that moves through this whole thing.

875
00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.488
<v woman>- This is an incredible area to begin watching.</v>

876
00:37:13.488 --> 00:37:16.198
And again, thank you for allowing us to see

877
00:37:16.198 --> 00:37:19.018
crystals in operation and watch the emanation

878
00:37:19.018 --> 00:37:20.818
coming from them.

879
00:37:21.618 --> 00:37:23.250
So where are you headed

880
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.943
with all of your work right now?

881
00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:27.353
Because aside from the obvious,

882
00:37:27.353 --> 00:37:29.393
which is you're showing a living universe.

883
00:37:29.393 --> 00:37:32.033
You're showing the full-colored, living,

884
00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:35.563
undulating, vibrating, alive universe.

885
00:37:35.563 --> 00:37:37.473
An energy field of all things around us.

886
00:37:37.473 --> 00:37:38.963
<v ->Is it all right to mention my book?</v>

887
00:37:38.963 --> 00:37:40.033
<v woman>Absolutely!</v>

888
00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:41.963
<v ->It's called Harry Oldfield's Invisible Universe.</v>

889
00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:44.273
That can be gotten on our web site

890
00:37:44.273 --> 00:37:45.803
and many other places.

891
00:37:47.123 --> 00:37:52.083
And that is a story of my discovery over many years.

892
00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:53.903
And I've gone beyond the book now.

893
00:37:53.903 --> 00:37:55.143
<v woman>That is what I wanted to find out.</v>

894
00:37:55.143 --> 00:37:58.003
<v ->Because I have got more and more fascinated</v>

895
00:37:58.003 --> 00:38:00.023
with the energy of the earth itself,

896
00:38:00.023 --> 00:38:03.913
and these wonderful, sacred spots

897
00:38:03.913 --> 00:38:06.163
and special places on the earth.

898
00:38:07.623 --> 00:38:09.373
Last year, for example,

899
00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:11.836
I was privileged, with Dr. Dailey,

900
00:38:11.836 --> 00:38:14.566
to photograph the energy of Niagara Falls.

901
00:38:14.566 --> 00:38:17.866
A wonderful place where

902
00:38:17.866 --> 00:38:21.826
the First Nation people have said, always,

903
00:38:21.826 --> 00:38:23.706
that there was a special energy there,

904
00:38:23.706 --> 00:38:26.886
special manitou, a spirit of the place.

905
00:38:27.856 --> 00:38:30.566
And we photographed this energy vortex

906
00:38:30.566 --> 00:38:33.816
that's so beautiful at Niagara

907
00:38:33.816 --> 00:38:36.506
with our system, PIP.

908
00:38:36.506 --> 00:38:41.146
And I've recently photographed the energy

909
00:38:41.146 --> 00:38:43.745
at another sacred site, in the United Kingdom,

910
00:38:43.745 --> 00:38:45.365
of Stone Henge.

911
00:38:45.365 --> 00:38:49.525
And we have energies swirling around the stones,

912
00:38:49.525 --> 00:38:51.485
interconnected between the stones.

913
00:38:51.485 --> 00:38:54.075
Beams of energy coming down from the sky,

914
00:38:54.075 --> 00:38:56.985
hitting the stones, and the stones interacting.

915
00:38:57.605 --> 00:38:59.585
Especially when the sun's up there.

916
00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:04.165
I believe that the ancient site

917
00:39:04.165 --> 00:39:07.655
was an ancient sun temple.

918
00:39:07.655 --> 00:39:11.255
These ancient people knew what they were doing

919
00:39:11.255 --> 00:39:12.905
when they put these stones there.

920
00:39:12.905 --> 00:39:15.425
They were creating an energy for that spot on the earth.

921
00:39:15.425 --> 00:39:18.205
Perhaps for their crops, perhaps for something else.

922
00:39:18.205 --> 00:39:20.745
I don't know, but they certainly, definitely

923
00:39:20.745 --> 00:39:22.165
knew what they were doing.

924
00:39:22.165 --> 00:39:23.145
It's a high-energy spot.

925
00:39:23.145 --> 00:39:25.006
<v woman>Just out of curiosity,</v>

926
00:39:25.006 --> 00:39:29.695
I have been living in Sedona for the last seven years.

927
00:39:29.695 --> 00:39:31.345
<v ->Oh my, that's a place I want to go.</v>

928
00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:33.965
I believe it has a very special energy in the United States.

929
00:39:33.965 --> 00:39:35.585
<v woman>Oh, I'd love to request that you do that.</v>

930
00:39:35.585 --> 00:39:37.556
<v ->I'd love to, next time I'm here.</v>

931
00:39:37.556 --> 00:39:38.885
Perhaps we can arrange something.

932
00:39:38.885 --> 00:39:40.246
<v ->Oh, I'd love that.</v>

933
00:39:40.246 --> 00:39:42.805
And then we can update this interview

934
00:39:42.805 --> 00:39:44.895
after you go to Sedona as well,

935
00:39:44.895 --> 00:39:46.175
with the imagery.

936
00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:48.955
And the people, everybody watching this interview.

937
00:39:48.955 --> 00:39:50.005
<v ->I would love to know.</v>

938
00:39:50.005 --> 00:39:51.825
I've heard of the energies there,

939
00:39:51.825 --> 00:39:53.045
they're legendary.

940
00:39:53.045 --> 00:39:54.975
But I would love to be one of the first

941
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.525
researchers to photograph it for you.

942
00:39:56.525 --> 00:39:59.125
<v woman>Oh, yes, well let's see what we can arrange.</v>

943
00:39:59.125 --> 00:40:01.581
And in the interim, I thank you so much for your time.

944
00:40:01.581 --> 00:40:03.411
Is there any other little wrap-up thought

945
00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:04.981
besides where you're going with this right now,

946
00:40:04.981 --> 00:40:06.261
that you'd like to share with us?

947
00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:08.041
On your discoveries.

948
00:40:08.041 --> 00:40:11.171
<v ->Well, basically, I just want to say</v>

949
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:13.931
it's just been great here in America.

950
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:18.041
The openness to my research

951
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:20.571
has been staggering.

952
00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:22.721
May I just say that I'm very grateful

953
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:26.572
to Dr. Norman Shealy and Holos University,

954
00:40:26.572 --> 00:40:28.592
who have recently, in the last couple of weeks,

955
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:33.292
appointed me as visiting professor of energy medicine

956
00:40:33.292 --> 00:40:35.052
at that wonderful university.

957
00:40:35.052 --> 00:40:38.732
It's a great privilege now for me to thank America

958
00:40:38.732 --> 00:40:41.133
for making me an American professor.

959
00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:42.893
<v woman>For embracing your knowledge.</v>

960
00:40:42.893 --> 00:40:45.533
Yes indeed. Well, you deserve it.

961
00:40:45.533 --> 00:40:46.733
<v ->Thank you.
<v woman>And more.</v>

962
00:40:46.733 --> 00:40:48.903
<v woman>And I can't wait to see what happens</v>

963
00:40:48.903 --> 00:40:51.093
with Sedona and all the work coming in the future.

964
00:40:51.093 --> 00:40:53.933
You're going to also have to tell us your beauty secret.

965
00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:56.091
You're a little older than you appear.

966
00:40:56.091 --> 00:40:57.181
Your skin is beautiful.
<v Harry>I thank you so much.</v>

967
00:40:57.181 --> 00:41:00.461
<v ->It's all to do, I think, with energy balance,</v>

968
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:02.971
and also the fact that my soul

969
00:41:02.971 --> 00:41:05.611
is doing what it wants to do in life.

970
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:09.741
I feel privileged that I can say that.

971
00:41:09.741 --> 00:41:12.041
And I would want every human being on the planet

972
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:15.791
to share that joy that every day I get

973
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:18.183
doing what I want to do in life

974
00:41:18.183 --> 00:41:19.741
to the best of my possibility.

975
00:41:19.741 --> 00:41:22.301
<v ->Well, it shows on all levels.</v>

976
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:23.041
Thank you so much, Harry.

977
00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:25.861
<v ->Thank you so much, everybody. Thank you.</v>

978
00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:28.921
<v ->You can learn more about PIP</v>

979
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:31.292
by visiting Harry's web site, listed below.

980
00:41:31.542 --> 00:41:33.492
Meanwhile, you'll likely want to take a look

981
00:41:33.492 --> 00:41:35.572
at the companion interview to this one,

982
00:41:35.572 --> 00:41:37.601
where we spoke with Dr. Brian Dailey,

983
00:41:37.601 --> 00:41:38.802
who works with Harry,

984
00:41:38.802 --> 00:41:40.521
validating how energy healing

985
00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:43.081
works with clients in real time.

986
00:41:43.081 --> 00:41:45.841
That healing energy is available to each of us and works

987
00:41:45.841 --> 00:41:48.621
is no longer up for debate, thanks to PIP.

988
00:41:48.821 --> 00:41:51.251
Until next time, thanks for watching.
