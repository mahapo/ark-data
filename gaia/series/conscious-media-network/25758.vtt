1
00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:02.533
<v ->Thomas Campbell began researching</v>

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.272
altered states of consciousness

3
00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:06.533
with Bob Monroe of the Monroe Institute

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.779
before the term out of body experience

5
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.016
had been coined.

6
00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.192
As a young physicist with an open mind

7
00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:14.688
he launched himself into states of consciousness

8
00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:16.832
he had never believed possible.

9
00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:18.378
Then spent the next 35 years

10
00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:19.914
researching the phenomena

11
00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:21.258
while working his day job

12
00:00:21.258 --> 00:00:23.837
developing missile defense systems.

13
00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.409
His summation of how we create

14
00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.199
and experience our own reality

15
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.773
took form in a very large book titled, My Big Toe.

16
00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:33.406
TOE meaning, Theory of Everything.

17
00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:36.770
Which also explains the telling of future events.

18
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.636
<v Voiceover>Tom, you had an unusual start to this</v>

19
00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:51.152
what is now becoming your passion

20
00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:53.395
and the very thing that I'm here

21
00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:54.946
listening to you lecture on.

22
00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:57.046
And that was in your earlier days,

23
00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.525
early twenties, right?

24
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.285
You were a physics student.

25
00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:01.827
You were also a double major,

26
00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.968
physics and math.

27
00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.504
So you were a brainiac.

28
00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:05.529
But on the other hand you were

29
00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:07.887
really driven by a deeper curiosity.

30
00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:08.937
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

31
00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:10.507
<v Regina>Can you talk a little bit about what happend</v>

32
00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:14.133
in those years going into your association with Monroe?

33
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.425
<v ->Sure.</v>

34
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.873
<v ->I had just gotten out of graduate school.</v>

35
00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:21.408
So that did put me probably,

36
00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:24.415
you know 26, 27, something like that.

37
00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:25.738
Late twenties.

38
00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.403
And when I walked into my office

39
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:32.817
my boss at that time,

40
00:01:32.817 --> 00:01:34.929
came in and he tossed a book at me

41
00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.644
and said, Tom read this.

42
00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:38.179
And I caught the book in my lap

43
00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.821
and I looked at it and it was

44
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.165
Bob Monroe's, Journey Out of the Body.

45
00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:44.187
And I'm thinking what is this?

46
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.488
I've only been there a few months,

47
00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:46.838
and was this a test?

48
00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:48.340
And how am I supposed to act?

49
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.640
So I did what he said

50
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.853
'cause when your boss says

51
00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:52.122
read the book, you read the book

52
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.512
<v Voiceover>That's an interesting thing</v>

53
00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.269
to have happen actually in that environment.

54
00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:57.579
<v ->I was working for Army Technical Intelligence.</v>

55
00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.976
<v Voiceover>There you go.</v>

56
00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:01.333
<v ->Yes and at that time it was</v>

57
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.115
Foreign Science and Technology Center,

58
00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:05.195
since it's changed it's acronyms a few times.

59
00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.573
But in any case I read the book

60
00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:09.816
and in a couple of weeks

61
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.933
I did my report which I knew was coming.

62
00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.436
And I told him the truth.

63
00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:21.757
I said how do you know whether this is real

64
00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:24.157
or whether this guy is just making it up?

65
00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:25.555
I mean how can you tell?

66
00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:27.293
If he's not making it up and it's real

67
00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:28.914
then that's like a wow!

68
00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.716
You know, I'm a physicist and what I do is,

69
00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:31.976
I'm interested in reality.

70
00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:32.967
Understanding reality.

71
00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.087
How does it work?

72
00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.488
And this is a whole 'nother phase.

73
00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:37.917
A whole 'nother piece of reality

74
00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:39.885
that I don't know anything about.

75
00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:41.636
So that's really exciting.

76
00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:42.713
On the other hand,

77
00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:43.908
if this guy's just trying to sell books

78
00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:46.193
by making up interesting stories

79
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.767
it doesn't mean anything.

80
00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.261
And, you know, how do you know?

81
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.024
How do you resolve that?

82
00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:52.505
So that's where it was

83
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.638
until a few months went by.

84
00:02:54.638 --> 00:02:56.503
And the boss comes in and says,

85
00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:58.275
hey, we found out Bob Monroe

86
00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:00.909
lives just about 45 minutes out of town.

87
00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.095
I was in Charlottesville, Virginia at the time.

88
00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:07.235
And we've made arrangements to go see him.

89
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:08.917
Would you like to come with us?

90
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.412
And you couldn't of kept me away from that

91
00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:12.945
for anything 'cause I wanted the answer to that question.

92
00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:16.262
You know, is this guy nuts or what?

93
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.603
And when we got there

94
00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:21.730
we drove into what was then Whistlefield Farm.

95
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.287
It was about a 500 acre estate that Bob Monroe owned.

96
00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:26.579
Beautiful estate.

97
00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.400
House up on the hill.

98
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.523
You know the manor house.

99
00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:31.062
You know, Virginia country gentlemen style.

100
00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:32.374
Very beautiful place.

101
00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:33.376
Two lakes.

102
00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:34.293
White board fence.

103
00:03:34.293 --> 00:03:36.235
Horses running along inside the fence

104
00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.293
with the car, you know, that sort of thing.

105
00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:39.925
And my first thought was

106
00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:41.568
this guy's not in it for the money.

107
00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:43.077
For whatever he makes in books

108
00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.055
is a pitiless compared to, you know,

109
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:46.649
what he already has under control

110
00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.305
because of this estate that he's living on.

111
00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:50.787
So I knew that wasn't it.

112
00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:52.732
And then Bob comes out.

113
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.981
And Bob is just as likable and straightforward.

114
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.615
And honest to God he wasn't selling anything.

115
00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:01.260
He wasn't trying to convince anybody of anything.

116
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.079
He was just, he actually acted more like

117
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.319
the engineers I was used to talking to.

118
00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.238
He was very straightforward, very scientific.

119
00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:12.283
He wanted things to make sense.

120
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:14.774
So that was my introduction to Bob Monroe.

121
00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:17.307
I just happened to be at the right place at the right time.

122
00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:18.651
So toward the end of that day,

123
00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:20.893
Bob took us up to the lab that he had just built.

124
00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:21.733
It was an empty building.

125
00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:22.896
Didn't have anything in it.

126
00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.891
And he said.

127
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:25.851
And we were a bunch of us.

128
00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:27.515
We're all scientists and engineers.

129
00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:29.456
That's Foreign Technology Center,

130
00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:30.832
we studied foreign technology

131
00:04:30.832 --> 00:04:32.578
to learn what we could learn from it.

132
00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:37.060
I was working physics modeling at the time.

133
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.001
So he said, well you guys are all scientists and engineers.

134
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:40.900
Would any of you like to help me,

135
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.131
you know, staff my lab and build equipment?

136
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.761
And my hand shot right up in the air

137
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:46.573
'cause I'd been a student all my life

138
00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:48.202
and that's what you do when you answer a question

139
00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:49.189
you stick your hand in the air.

140
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.381
So I must of looked kind of silly

141
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.619
sticking my hand up in the air

142
00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:53.722
but that was what I did.

143
00:04:53.722 --> 00:04:56.901
And this other guy Dennis Mennerick.

144
00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:58.386
He was also young. He was an engineer.

145
00:04:58.386 --> 00:05:00.522
He was a double E and I was a physicist.

146
00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:02.837
You know, we both said yeah we'd love to do it.

147
00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.684
Everybody else sat there and looked at their feet.

148
00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.449
So Bob said, okay call me up

149
00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.558
you know, and we'll do something.

150
00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:10.778
And Bob went out of town.

151
00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:12.261
And eventually we did meet with Bob

152
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.253
and we did instrument his lab.

153
00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:16.469
We did do the equipment.

154
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:17.514
We build equipment.

155
00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:19.531
Custom built a lot of the equipment at that time.

156
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:21.408
And we scrounged up other equipment

157
00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:23.808
from the institutions of learning

158
00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:26.756
where we knew they had extra equipment.

159
00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.909
And Bob started to fulfill his part of the bargan

160
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.852
was to teach us how to do out of body

161
00:05:32.852 --> 00:05:35.188
and how to experience the things that he experienced.

162
00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:36.351
We wanted to experience them

163
00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:38.132
otherwise we'd never know

164
00:05:38.132 --> 00:05:40.232
whether they were real or not.

165
00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:41.907
We had to have it as our experience

166
00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:43.347
and we both knew that.

167
00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:44.808
And in my mind I thought, well you know,

168
00:05:44.808 --> 00:05:46.333
the best thing that could happen

169
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:47.809
was I'll learn some really neat things

170
00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:48.803
and I'll have a lot of fun.

171
00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:49.891
The worst things that could happen is

172
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.760
this guy's bogus as a three dollar bill

173
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.085
and I'll just leave, you know?

174
00:05:54.085 --> 00:05:55.099
So that was my thought.

175
00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.381
Well, Bob was genuine.

176
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.800
He was real.

177
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.645
His experiences were real.

178
00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:02.266
He was straightforward.

179
00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.845
And he did teach us in some months, some years.

180
00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:06.931
He did teach Dennis and I both to go out of body

181
00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:09.629
and whatever we wanted to, kind of on demand.

182
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.068
And we actually, Dennis and I,

183
00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.771
primarily Dennis I guess in this case.

184
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:17.395
We came up with the Hemi-Sync

185
00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:19.690
which is now the, which is now the,

186
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.899
kind of the defining technology of TMI.

187
00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:27.302
That Dennis saw that at work in the library.

188
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.805
Scientific American by Oster, I think.

189
00:06:31.805 --> 00:06:34.226
This would have been, it was an old article.

190
00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:36.082
He read it in the Scientific American

191
00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:37.565
and they were talking about

192
00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:40.140
entraining brainwaves in this article.

193
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.855
And about the research that had been done

194
00:06:41.855 --> 00:06:43.189
and the history of it and so on.

195
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.151
And Dennis thought, let's try this.

196
00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:47.732
Because we had been trying everything in the lab.

197
00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.655
Bob had these four hertz,

198
00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:53.151
four cycles per second oscillations

199
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:54.591
just as he exited body.

200
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:55.646
That was one of the artifacts

201
00:06:55.646 --> 00:06:56.916
of his going out of body.

202
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.274
<v Voiceover>Which is essentially like low theta, right?</v>

203
00:06:59.274 --> 00:07:01.321
It's where you're not in sleep,

204
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:04.429
you're just in a conscious state on the border, yeah.

205
00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:07.084
<v ->And he had these oscillations.</v>

206
00:07:07.084 --> 00:07:08.802
So we, just as you said,

207
00:07:08.802 --> 00:07:10.330
we associated those with brainwaves.

208
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.613
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

209
00:07:11.613 --> 00:07:12.983
<v ->And we used the EEG.</v>

210
00:07:12.983 --> 00:07:14.871
We measured 'em and we did get brainwaves.

211
00:07:14.905 --> 00:07:17.401
And we could actually see the oscillation on the EEG.

212
00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:19.956
The patterns would oscillate.

213
00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:24.395
So we decided that well this would be a good thing to try.

214
00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:26.518
We were in the mode of just cut and dry.

215
00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:28.362
It was all experimental to us.

216
00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:29.376
There was no theory.

217
00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:30.976
<v Voiceover>It sounds like so much fun.</v>

218
00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:32.823
<v ->There was no theory and we had done everything.</v>

219
00:07:32.823 --> 00:07:34.698
I sat on a stool with two huge

220
00:07:34.698 --> 00:07:36.265
capasitors on either side of my head

221
00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:39.048
trying to oscillate the pineal gland.

222
00:07:39.246 --> 00:07:41.401
We did everything we could think of

223
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:45.337
that would enable us to create an altered state

224
00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:47.918
that would then be one that you could jump

225
00:07:47.918 --> 00:07:50.424
to the out of body from that altered state.

226
00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:52.365
And we wanted to be able to reproduce it.

227
00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.306
We were looking for science.

228
00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:56.994
So anyway, Dennis got this idea

229
00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:58.573
and he made a binaural beat tape.

230
00:07:58.573 --> 00:07:59.949
He borrowed the equipment.

231
00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:01.314
He made the tape.

232
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.276
And Bob was out of town that week.

233
00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:06.107
I think he was out at Esland giving a program.

234
00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:11.618
So Dennis came to the lab and I came with him

235
00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:13.474
and he put this tape on that he made.

236
00:08:13.474 --> 00:08:15.137
And we listened to it and it was like

237
00:08:15.137 --> 00:08:17.280
wow, that worked, you know?

238
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.158
That was good, yeah.

239
00:08:19.158 --> 00:08:20.912
It just was so much better than

240
00:08:20.912 --> 00:08:22.491
the sound that Bob had been playing.

241
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:24.933
He had a little sound generator that he was using.

242
00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:26.469
But it wasn't as potent.

243
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:28.167
<v Voiceover>Was it more like white noise?</v>

244
00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:30.557
<v ->It was pink noise and he was trying</v>

245
00:08:30.557 --> 00:08:32.819
to modulate that noise at the four hertz.

246
00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:35.357
So it almost sounded like brushes on a drum.

247
00:08:35.357 --> 00:08:38.354
(mimicking four hertz beat sound)

248
00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:40.503
A little surf-ey, you know, a little like surf,

249
00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:43.265
but a little more like brushes on a drum.

250
00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:46.169
But it was a modulated four hertz,

251
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:47.779
you had a four hertz beat which is about,

252
00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:49.078
(mimicking four hertz beat sound)

253
00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.180
That's about four hertz and then that would rise and fall

254
00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:56.976
sort of like with a two or three second which was a delta.

255
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.082
You know, it had a low delta,

256
00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:00.736
but it had this four hertz riding on it.

257
00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:02.058
And it was a very pleasant sound.

258
00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:05.271
It was pink noise but it was relaxing.

259
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.024
That was it's main function.

260
00:09:08.024 --> 00:09:10.147
This was more than relaxing.

261
00:09:10.147 --> 00:09:13.349
This binaural beat actually entrained your brainwaves.

262
00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:15.790
And when we measured it with the EEG we could see

263
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.186
that the brainwaves getting into sync.

264
00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:20.309
You start and you have some in everything.

265
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.288
You have a little bit of theta but you have more alpha,

266
00:09:22.288 --> 00:09:24.282
you have a lot of beta.

267
00:09:24.282 --> 00:09:26.203
And all of these energy spectrum are

268
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:27.968
being triggered kind of at the same time.

269
00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:29.141
You spread all over.

270
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:31.648
And then you start playing this binaural beat

271
00:09:31.648 --> 00:09:33.568
and suddenly everything falls away except

272
00:09:33.568 --> 00:09:36.027
the theta state and the theta state grows.

273
00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:38.421
So that's what we noticed on the EEG.

274
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:41.077
So then we experimented with it.

275
00:09:41.077 --> 00:09:43.886
And Bob came back and he was excited about it too.

276
00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:45.674
And we went through a lot of experiments

277
00:09:45.674 --> 00:09:48.021
trying to say what should the bass frequency be?

278
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.604
Was it really four or was it 3.85? Was it this?

279
00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:54.410
And we did experiments for months trying to optimize

280
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.222
the effect of, you know, what worked best.

281
00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.678
Should you ramp it slowly? You know?

282
00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:01.334
Start from the beta and work your way down?

283
00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:04.485
And then start this or what?

284
00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:09.354
And eventually we came up with what worked best.

285
00:10:09.354 --> 00:10:12.364
And Bob then took that,

286
00:10:12.364 --> 00:10:14.668
he tried it on all sorts of people.

287
00:10:14.668 --> 00:10:15.724
You know, that was the idea.

288
00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:18.344
People off the street needed to be able to

289
00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:21.856
come to an altered state that took the ordinary person

290
00:10:21.856 --> 00:10:24.234
10 years to learn how to do through meditation

291
00:10:24.234 --> 00:10:26.430
and he wanted to be able to stimulate that.

292
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.451
Well it worked, people would come in there

293
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:30.051
and they would have these experiences.

294
00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:30.953
They would go out of body.

295
00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:32.708
Some of 'em would just fall asleep.

296
00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:34.205
They would be well rested, you know?

297
00:10:34.205 --> 00:10:36.188
Walk in his lab, put on the headphones, and clunk.

298
00:10:36.188 --> 00:10:37.512
You know? They were gone.

299
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.163
And those were people who really--

300
00:10:40.163 --> 00:10:41.475
<v Voiceover>Needed sleep.</v>

301
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:42.861
<v ->Well, I don't think they needed sleep.</v>

302
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:46.724
I think they really could not process what was going on.

303
00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:49.678
They got into the larger reality and it just didn't

304
00:10:50.035 --> 00:10:52.419
process for them so they shut it off.

305
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:54.809
So they just went to sleep and lost consciousness.

306
00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:56.953
They weren't tired because as soon as the tape was over

307
00:10:57.212 --> 00:10:58.794
they'd be awake just like that.

308
00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:00.683
If they were asleep they would of continued to sleep.

309
00:11:00.683 --> 00:11:02.633
They were just basically blanking out

310
00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:04.989
the experience because they didn't,

311
00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.965
they weren't successful dealing with it.

312
00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:09.906
<v Voiceover>But what were you and Dennis doing with it?</v>

313
00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:12.151
<v ->Now, what Dennis and I were doing with it is</v>

314
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.075
from then on these binaural beats

315
00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:16.887
were added to all the tapes that Bob made.

316
00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:18.127
To all the sounds that he made.

317
00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:19.646
He had his generator guy

318
00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.159
who designed the electronics

319
00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.771
that made his sounds, so he put those in it

320
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:27.480
So that became part of our

321
00:11:27.484 --> 00:11:30.503
instrumentation of the sounds that we were listening.

322
00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:31.577
So Dennis and I would come out

323
00:11:31.577 --> 00:11:32.963
and we'd make our own tapes.

324
00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:34.403
The things that we liked

325
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:35.793
weren't necessarily the same things

326
00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:37.307
that were best for everybody.

327
00:11:37.307 --> 00:11:39.173
That was more at a common level.

328
00:11:39.173 --> 00:11:41.873
After a while you don't need the same hand holding.

329
00:11:41.873 --> 00:11:43.248
We don't need the ramp down.

330
00:11:43.248 --> 00:11:44.624
That's just a waste of time.

331
00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:45.712
You know, you just go right to it.

332
00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:48.528
So we didn't necessarily like the same frequencies

333
00:11:48.528 --> 00:11:51.248
that were good for us but not necessarily good

334
00:11:51.248 --> 00:11:53.713
for a new person just off the street.

335
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.710
So we would play with our own and do that.

336
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.149
And we played with different volumes

337
00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:00.890
and different intensities and different wave patterns.

338
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.811
We did sinusoids, triangle waves,

339
00:12:02.811 --> 00:12:03.845
you know, all kinds of things.

340
00:12:03.845 --> 00:12:06.013
We continued to do research on it.

341
00:12:06.013 --> 00:12:08.232
And meanwhile every,

342
00:12:08.232 --> 00:12:09.553
well it was probably,

343
00:12:09.553 --> 00:12:10.690
I think it was three times a week.

344
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.092
Like Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays we'd go out to Bob's.

345
00:12:13.092 --> 00:12:14.345
Bob would put us in the booth.

346
00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:15.945
These were isolation booths.

347
00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:20.646
And then he would lead us through the out of body thing

348
00:12:20.646 --> 00:12:22.822
And after a while we didn't need much leading.

349
00:12:22.822 --> 00:12:24.166
We'd just go.

350
00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.378
And then we would report back.

351
00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:29.669
He'd have microphones were suspended above our mouths.

352
00:12:29.931 --> 00:12:32.283
And we were on water-beds in isolation chambers

353
00:12:32.283 --> 00:12:34.384
that were acoustically isolated.

354
00:12:34.384 --> 00:12:36.687
They were electromagnetically isolated.

355
00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:39.120
They had metal walls that were grounded.

356
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.666
And we were in these chambers.

357
00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:44.093
And he had three of 'em in a row.

358
00:12:44.093 --> 00:12:45.865
I'd take the first one. Dennis took the last one.

359
00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:48.223
So there was an empty one between us.

360
00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:50.921
So he would do that and then we would go out of body.

361
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:52.489
And he would maybe give us a goal.

362
00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:53.364
What it is we should do.

363
00:12:53.364 --> 00:12:54.910
You know, contact someone.

364
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.566
And he may have some questions he wanted to ask.

365
00:12:57.566 --> 00:12:58.888
And sometimes the questions were,

366
00:12:58.888 --> 00:13:00.381
how do we do this better?

367
00:13:00.381 --> 00:13:01.726
What frequencies are best?

368
00:13:01.726 --> 00:13:03.508
You know, how, you know.

369
00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:05.886
Trying to polish our own techniques.

370
00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:07.601
Sometimes we would just have questions of our own

371
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:09.926
and we would report back but always we were in contact.

372
00:13:09.926 --> 00:13:11.347
We would go out of body,

373
00:13:11.347 --> 00:13:13.747
we'd interact with nonphysical beings

374
00:13:13.747 --> 00:13:16.552
and then we would tell Bob what we saw,

375
00:13:16.552 --> 00:13:18.206
what was said, you know, what was going on.

376
00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:19.558
<v Voiceover>You and Dennis would</v>

377
00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:20.858
you guys would hook up together?

378
00:13:20.858 --> 00:13:24.132
<v ->We did travel together sometimes.</v>

379
00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:26.277
Myself and Nancy Lee did that too.

380
00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:27.449
But that was different.

381
00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:29.227
This was like two of us would be there.

382
00:13:29.227 --> 00:13:33.145
He would give us the same instructions

383
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:36.490
but we would interact singly, individually.

384
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.802
We were totally individuals.

385
00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:39.668
He was getting two different view points on it.

386
00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:41.544
And I think that's what gave him the idea because

387
00:13:41.544 --> 00:13:42.910
our view points started to converge

388
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.735
after we got good at this.

389
00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.836
They started to converge a lot.

390
00:13:46.836 --> 00:13:49.748
And then he had the bright idea,

391
00:13:49.748 --> 00:13:50.975
which is what you mentioned,

392
00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:53.075
that Dennis and I should go out together.

393
00:13:53.075 --> 00:13:55.008
And that was an experiment that we

394
00:13:55.008 --> 00:13:56.575
repeated a couple of times.

395
00:13:56.575 --> 00:13:58.932
And I repeated it with others as well.

396
00:13:58.932 --> 00:14:01.053
Nancy Lee, at that time it was Nancy Lee Honeycut,

397
00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:03.410
that was Bob's step daughter.

398
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.206
Now, married to Joe McMonigle.

399
00:14:08.426 --> 00:14:10.876
We also went out and had an adventure together like that.

400
00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:13.648
His instructions for Dennis and I were go above the

401
00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:15.547
you know, go up above the lab

402
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:17.756
meet there in the out of body state

403
00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:20.261
and then go on adventure together but stick together.

404
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.869
And we were in these isolation chambers

405
00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:25.701
and so basically we did that.

406
00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:27.363
And it probably took close to two hours

407
00:14:27.363 --> 00:14:30.094
for us in this out of body thing.

408
00:14:30.094 --> 00:14:31.950
And it was a very eventful one.

409
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.538
You know, saw a lot of things,

410
00:14:33.538 --> 00:14:34.531
had a lot of conversations,

411
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:35.718
talked to each other.

412
00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:37.601
It wasn't a dull time.

413
00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:40.316
And we came back,

414
00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:42.555
and we had been doing this now

415
00:14:42.555 --> 00:14:45.738
for probably at this point two years.

416
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.165
So it had been a lot in two years.

417
00:14:48.165 --> 00:14:49.850
What we're talking about is

418
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.952
three sessions a week with Bob.

419
00:14:51.952 --> 00:14:53.583
Sessions lasted from about

420
00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:54.927
6:30 in the evening

421
00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.890
to about 2 o'clock in the morning.

422
00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.737
And then we'd go home, at least I did.

423
00:14:58.737 --> 00:15:00.711
I'd go home at 2 o'clock in the morning

424
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:03.389
and practice until it's time to get up to go to work.

425
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:05.106
And then I'd go to work.

426
00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:08.252
And it's like having two jobs.

427
00:15:08.252 --> 00:15:10.609
You know, we were working a job with Bob.

428
00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.829
<v Voiceover>But you must have loved every minute.</v>

429
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.982
<v ->I was loving it, it was fun</v>

430
00:15:13.982 --> 00:15:15.857
because we were learning things.

431
00:15:15.857 --> 00:15:19.006
And of course in the lab everything had to be evidential.

432
00:15:19.006 --> 00:15:22.330
Bob wasn't interested in giving us neat experiences.

433
00:15:22.804 --> 00:15:24.959
He was interested in collecting evidence.

434
00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:27.561
He wanted this to be science.

435
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.363
That's why he wanted scientists doing it.

436
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:31.633
He didn't want this to be, oh I had a wonderful experience

437
00:15:31.634 --> 00:15:33.901
and I went out and I saw pink elephants dancing.

438
00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:35.866
You know? And that's not what he wanted.

439
00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:38.724
So he had us doing all sorts of things.

440
00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:41.049
He had us reading, remote viewing, you know?

441
00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:43.289
And then testing whether or not we saw what was right.

442
00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:44.623
He had us healing.

443
00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:45.806
He had us going places.

444
00:15:45.806 --> 00:15:47.086
He had us going into the future

445
00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:49.209
and reading newspaper headlines.

446
00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:50.752
He had us doing everything

447
00:15:50.752 --> 00:15:52.804
we could think of that would be evidential.

448
00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:56.774
And the time we were two years in, you know,

449
00:15:56.774 --> 00:15:59.995
the probability that what we were getting was random,

450
00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.014
was probably about 1 in five million, you know?

451
00:16:03.014 --> 00:16:07.387
We were getting things that were clearly paranormal data.

452
00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:10.085
Data that you couldn't get by normal means.

453
00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:12.395
<v Voiceover>Well now, how far in the future, for example--</v>

454
00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:15.727
<v ->We generally would go like a week.</v>

455
00:16:15.727 --> 00:16:17.785
And we'd read a newspaper headline

456
00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:19.247
or something like that from a week in the future

457
00:16:19.247 --> 00:16:20.504
and then we'd see what the headline said.

458
00:16:20.504 --> 00:16:21.848
You know, it was this sort of thing.

459
00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:25.144
So he had us going past, future, present,

460
00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:26.668
healing, remote viewing, you know,

461
00:16:26.668 --> 00:16:27.814
anything that we could think of

462
00:16:27.814 --> 00:16:30.448
that then we could collect data on

463
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.048
to see whether we were right or not.

464
00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:33.953
So over the years you kind of get a sense of

465
00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:35.994
honing that, of what works, what doesn't.

466
00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:37.887
You get better at it.

467
00:16:38.138 --> 00:16:42.369
And we had done that but it was all intellectual.

468
00:16:42.417 --> 00:16:43.963
Alright, I'm a scientist and I can see that

469
00:16:43.963 --> 00:16:45.882
what I've just done, the data I've collected

470
00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:47.760
was one in a million that I could

471
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.090
collect that data by chance.

472
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.485
That I could read that eight digit number

473
00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:53.991
off the black board by chance, you know?

474
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:55.512
You can do the probability of that.

475
00:16:55.512 --> 00:16:56.909
And I knew that it was

476
00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:58.455
highly unlikely that it was chance.

477
00:16:58.455 --> 00:17:00.172
I knew something was going on

478
00:17:00.172 --> 00:17:01.730
but that's all in your head.

479
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.828
That's intellectual.

480
00:17:02.828 --> 00:17:05.517
You know it, you believe it,

481
00:17:05.517 --> 00:17:08.055
but it's not your knowledge at a deep level.

482
00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:10.210
And this thing with Dennis was for me.

483
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.429
That was a big point for me.

484
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:13.751
So he had Dennis and I go out.

485
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:15.861
We had this adventure. We'd come back.

486
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:17.301
You know, we've been there for two hours

487
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:18.600
and it's been dark, you know.

488
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.276
And he's trained us to go and come back

489
00:17:21.276 --> 00:17:23.164
and report and talk.

490
00:17:23.164 --> 00:17:24.736
So we'd stumble out into the light

491
00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:26.487
and it's always, you know, the bright lights.

492
00:17:26.487 --> 00:17:28.706
And got down to the end of the hall.

493
00:17:28.706 --> 00:17:29.986
And you have to know Bob Monroe.

494
00:17:29.986 --> 00:17:32.844
He had a very sardonic and dry wit.

495
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.541
So we'd come there and he looked at us

496
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:35.964
and he grinned and he says,

497
00:17:35.964 --> 00:17:38.726
do you two really think you were out together?

498
00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:41.531
And we looked at each other and I said,

499
00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:42.991
well yeah it seemed that way.

500
00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:44.550
And he said, yeah it seemed that way.

501
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.970
And he said, well listen to this.

502
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.089
And he reached out and he flipped the two tapes.

503
00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:51.366
Which was Dennis' audio and my audio.

504
00:17:51.366 --> 00:17:54.063
Now, of course, we couldn't hear each other.

505
00:17:54.063 --> 00:17:56.326
He talked to us indvidually.

506
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.384
So he'd ask Dennis, what are you seeing?

507
00:17:58.384 --> 00:18:00.943
And then he'd ask me on a separate line,

508
00:18:00.943 --> 00:18:02.266
you know, what are you seeing?

509
00:18:02.266 --> 00:18:04.581
And he'd have these things.

510
00:18:04.581 --> 00:18:06.458
So those tapes started to roll

511
00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:08.857
and there was Dennis and I out of body

512
00:18:08.857 --> 00:18:09.999
having conversations, you know,

513
00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:11.418
answering each others questions,

514
00:18:11.418 --> 00:18:13.178
seeing the same things,

515
00:18:13.178 --> 00:18:15.300
having basically the same experience.

516
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.250
Now it was through Dennis' interpretation

517
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.532
and my interpretation.

518
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.825
You could see, just as if two people went on a vacation

519
00:18:20.825 --> 00:18:22.308
and they were both talking about it

520
00:18:22.308 --> 00:18:24.110
it's different but it's the same.

521
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.272
You know, you obviously can tell

522
00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:27.092
they wen't on the same vacation.

523
00:18:27.092 --> 00:18:28.313
That's the way this was.

524
00:18:28.313 --> 00:18:30.244
And that hit me like a ton of bricks.

525
00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:32.345
That hit me, not at the intellectual level,

526
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:34.287
but you know, deeper.

527
00:18:34.287 --> 00:18:35.748
And the reason it hit me that way

528
00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:38.403
is because to me, that meant

529
00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:42.173
that what I was getting was objective.

530
00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:44.850
You see if it just mine I could imagine

531
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.769
that there was something weird going on

532
00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:49.916
that I was able to pick up this data paranormally.

533
00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:52.167
But it was all subjective.

534
00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:54.332
It was just something that happened through,

535
00:18:54.332 --> 00:18:56.007
you know, my out of body, you know.

536
00:18:56.597 --> 00:18:58.855
It was just me and you couldn't

537
00:18:58.855 --> 00:19:00.230
really tell what was going on.

538
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.275
How was that happening?

539
00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:03.719
Were you picking it up because you were there looking at it?

540
00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:06.016
Were you getting that from somebody else's mind?

541
00:19:06.016 --> 00:19:07.636
You know, what was the mechanism?

542
00:19:07.636 --> 00:19:09.513
Was it really objective?

543
00:19:09.513 --> 00:19:11.070
This had to be objective.

544
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.012
How else could Dennis and I

545
00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:14.452
be talking about the same thing

546
00:19:14.452 --> 00:19:16.040
unless we saw the same thing?

547
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.827
<v Voiceover>So it was kind of the validation you really--</v>

548
00:19:17.827 --> 00:19:19.127
<v ->A validation I needed.</v>

549
00:19:19.127 --> 00:19:22.195
And at that point, like I've told others,

550
00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:23.955
I probably walked around for two weeks

551
00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.779
in a bit of a daze, you know.

552
00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:27.603
My God, this is real.

553
00:19:27.603 --> 00:19:29.348
You know? This is real!

554
00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:31.225
And that was a big turning point.

555
00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:32.720
Now after that I didn't need to ask the question,

556
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.743
whether it real anymore.

557
00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:34.682
I knew that it was real.

558
00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:35.781
It was objective.

559
00:19:35.781 --> 00:19:37.557
I was having those experiences.

560
00:19:37.557 --> 00:19:40.147
Okay, now that I had context for the fact

561
00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:41.876
that we were doing one in a million

562
00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:43.505
data collection that was paranormal

563
00:19:44.355 --> 00:19:45.837
I really had a sense of it being real.

564
00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:47.319
Now, I'm a physicist.

565
00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.671
So what I do for, you know, my career

566
00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:52.209
is understanding how things work.

567
00:19:52.209 --> 00:19:53.608
That's what physics does.

568
00:19:53.608 --> 00:19:54.845
How does the world work?

569
00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:57.202
What's the reality model that describes this?

570
00:19:57.202 --> 00:19:59.305
So that was my passion.

571
00:19:59.305 --> 00:20:00.446
That was my aim.

572
00:20:00.446 --> 00:20:03.143
After that experience was to figure out

573
00:20:03.143 --> 00:20:05.171
what is going on here?

574
00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:06.407
What are the rules?

575
00:20:06.407 --> 00:20:08.147
How do you go out of body?

576
00:20:08.147 --> 00:20:09.491
You know, what does that mean?

577
00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:11.164
What are the limitations?

578
00:20:11.164 --> 00:20:12.968
So I spent the next

579
00:20:12.968 --> 00:20:17.651
35 years, 40 years exploring.

580
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:20.147
Doing research, doing experiments.

581
00:20:20.147 --> 00:20:22.249
Because you could eliminate some variables.

582
00:20:22.249 --> 00:20:23.592
Say, what does this mean?

583
00:20:23.592 --> 00:20:24.744
How far does this go?

584
00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:26.642
How can I manipulate this?

585
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:29.288
You know, just like we were talking about earlier today.

586
00:20:29.288 --> 00:20:31.870
You find out that you can see auras.

587
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.651
I got that early on where I started

588
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:35.629
seeing energy around people.

589
00:20:35.629 --> 00:20:38.959
I realized that I could specify what the colors meant.

590
00:20:39.201 --> 00:20:41.601
And then that means that,

591
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:43.744
well those colors aren't fundamental.

592
00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:47.186
You know? That's your interpretation.

593
00:20:47.186 --> 00:20:49.042
<v Voiceover>So when you say you could specify it</v>

594
00:20:49.042 --> 00:20:52.988
you could say, okay I want to use this color

595
00:20:52.988 --> 00:20:57.393
to show me say, a healthy or a healthy portion

596
00:20:57.393 --> 00:20:59.036
of the aura, the physical or something.

597
00:20:59.036 --> 00:21:00.258
And you could choose.

598
00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:01.495
<v ->Right or I could have, you know,</v>

599
00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:03.493
the way I wanted to, right,

600
00:21:03.493 --> 00:21:07.118
the way I was interpreting the aura

601
00:21:07.118 --> 00:21:08.834
I could choose what it meant.

602
00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:11.938
So I had read, what's it called?

603
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:16.027
Man Physical and I don't know.

604
00:21:16.027 --> 00:21:19.078
It was a Leadbeater, C.W Leadbeater back in the--

605
00:21:19.078 --> 00:21:20.635
<v Voiceover>80's I was reading it.</v>

606
00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:22.300
<v ->Long, long time ago.</v>

607
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.593
He published that probably in the late 1800's.

608
00:21:24.593 --> 00:21:27.035
I know that he's one of the original theosophists.

609
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:30.031
And, Man Visible and Invisible, was the name of that.

610
00:21:30.031 --> 00:21:32.291
And I had read that and I saw his colors

611
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.125
and that's basically the way I saw it

612
00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:35.405
was the way he saw it.

613
00:21:35.405 --> 00:21:36.025
But then I learned that

614
00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:37.721
that didn't have to be the way it was.

615
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:39.976
You could change that all around.

616
00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:42.606
<v Voiceover>And still be getting accurate data?</v>

617
00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:44.046
<v ->Get the same data.</v>

618
00:21:44.046 --> 00:21:45.699
You get exactly the same data.

619
00:21:45.699 --> 00:21:48.241
And then I knew that those colors were just metaphors.

620
00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:50.608
It was how you interpreted the data.

621
00:21:50.608 --> 00:21:52.101
So you'd do experiments like that.

622
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:53.158
Dennis one day walked up

623
00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:55.367
and tossed a picture in front of me.

624
00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:57.811
And he said there were like five people in the picture.

625
00:21:57.811 --> 00:22:00.145
He said, one of the people in the picture

626
00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:02.740
is a renown psychic.

627
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.063
The others aren't.

628
00:22:04.063 --> 00:22:05.248
Which one?

629
00:22:05.248 --> 00:22:07.509
And I'd been seeing auras then

630
00:22:07.509 --> 00:22:09.659
for only maybe three or four months.

631
00:22:09.659 --> 00:22:11.461
So I looked at the thing and her aura

632
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:14.274
blossoms up around everybody in the picture.

633
00:22:14.274 --> 00:22:15.928
And that was another lesson, you know?

634
00:22:15.928 --> 00:22:17.196
You learn something.

635
00:22:17.196 --> 00:22:19.234
That it doesn't have to do with

636
00:22:19.234 --> 00:22:21.937
looking at a person and seeing their aura.

637
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.288
It has to do with your mind.

638
00:22:24.288 --> 00:22:26.625
The person isn't that important.

639
00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:30.374
You can have a metaphor

640
00:22:30.374 --> 00:22:32.634
for the person who owns the picture.

641
00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:33.833
And you could still see the same aura

642
00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:35.070
and get the same information.

643
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.190
So I looked at them

644
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.180
and there was this one person

645
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.492
who had this big well-developed

646
00:22:38.492 --> 00:22:40.252
bright aura and the rest of 'em didn't.

647
00:22:40.252 --> 00:22:41.499
So I said, that one.

648
00:22:41.499 --> 00:22:42.577
And he said, you're right.

649
00:22:42.577 --> 00:22:43.633
You know?

650
00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:45.991
And I didn't know actually that he knew.

651
00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:48.252
I thought he just wanted me to tell him

652
00:22:48.252 --> 00:22:50.097
which one it was but he knew the answer.

653
00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:52.550
And it was a test, he wanted to see.

654
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.728
<v Voiceover>So really it was programmed by your</v>

655
00:22:53.728 --> 00:22:56.927
intention to connect with the data in the photo.

656
00:22:56.927 --> 00:22:59.295
<v ->Exactly, the data is out there.</v>

657
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.905
So you can connect with that data.

658
00:23:00.905 --> 00:23:02.234
And then that was another big a-ha.

659
00:23:02.234 --> 00:23:04.920
It's not something that goes around with the person.

660
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.299
It's just data and you can connect to it.

661
00:23:07.299 --> 00:23:10.116
And you can get the data to present itself

662
00:23:10.116 --> 00:23:11.800
in whatever format you want.

663
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.051
So as I experimented with these things

664
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:17.378
and you know, learned more and more

665
00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:19.437
about how it worked and what didn't work,

666
00:23:19.437 --> 00:23:23.598
I realized that basically everything was interpretation.

667
00:23:23.598 --> 00:23:25.398
That reality is personal.

668
00:23:25.398 --> 00:23:26.914
It's not objective.

669
00:23:26.914 --> 00:23:29.176
You interpret it based on

670
00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:30.551
what's inside of you,

671
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:32.236
you're experience.

672
00:23:32.236 --> 00:23:33.890
That's how you interpret it.

673
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.263
And if to you bright red, zig-zaggy things

674
00:23:36.263 --> 00:23:38.973
indicate fear or anger then that's

675
00:23:38.973 --> 00:23:42.160
a good interpretation for anger, say.

676
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.902
Dark colors, you know we have this,

677
00:23:45.964 --> 00:23:47.470
these general ideas about things. You know?

678
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.777
The cowboys in the white hats are the good guys

679
00:23:49.777 --> 00:23:51.793
and the black hats are the bad guys.

680
00:23:51.793 --> 00:23:53.286
So the stuffs that bad or evil,

681
00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:55.515
or not good, well, we make it dark.

682
00:23:55.515 --> 00:23:57.019
The stuff that's good and wonderful

683
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.024
and lovely, we make that light.

684
00:23:59.024 --> 00:24:00.720
That's just kind of natural.

685
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.913
But then I found out that you didn't have to do that.

686
00:24:02.913 --> 00:24:04.651
You could do it just the opposite if you wanted.

687
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:05.953
You could work on your healing

688
00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:07.894
and make all the good stuff black.

689
00:24:08.804 --> 00:24:10.949
Then I realized that was very helpful

690
00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.870
because if you were looking for just a few

691
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.367
cancer cells loose, say, after an operation

692
00:24:15.367 --> 00:24:17.363
and see whether they got it all,

693
00:24:17.363 --> 00:24:18.668
you could go in and you could say

694
00:24:18.668 --> 00:24:21.932
I want all the healthy stuff to be black

695
00:24:21.932 --> 00:24:23.852
and I want those cancer cells

696
00:24:23.852 --> 00:24:26.550
to be bright white, just glowing.

697
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.509
You can see a white spot

698
00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:32.485
in a black background much much easier

699
00:24:32.485 --> 00:24:35.192
than you can find a tiny black speck

700
00:24:35.192 --> 00:24:36.856
in a white background.

701
00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:38.165
You see? It makes a big difference.

702
00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:38.963
<v Voiceover>You turned it into a negative,</v>

703
00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:40.527
so to speak, for your own convenience

704
00:24:40.527 --> 00:24:41.911
so that you can view better.

705
00:24:41.911 --> 00:24:43.510
<v ->So then I kinda learned that.</v>

706
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.494
I said, hey these are just tools.

707
00:24:45.494 --> 00:24:47.628
This white light and putting light on a subject,

708
00:24:47.628 --> 00:24:50.310
you know, that's just metaphors and it's just tools.

709
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.889
So it was my own research.

710
00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:54.022
It was my own experimentation

711
00:24:54.022 --> 00:24:56.848
that allowed me to basically understand

712
00:24:56.848 --> 00:24:58.747
something about how the reality worked.

713
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.528
And the more you understand

714
00:25:00.528 --> 00:25:02.684
the easier it is to understand more.

715
00:25:02.684 --> 00:25:04.401
So it just works that way. You know?

716
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:06.868
The more you know the more it works.

717
00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:09.726
Now you can't just take one data point

718
00:25:09.726 --> 00:25:11.145
and come to a conclusion.

719
00:25:11.145 --> 00:25:13.619
You have to do this a lot of different ways.

720
00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:15.742
It has to be consistent.

721
00:25:15.742 --> 00:25:17.961
If it's not, it's not science.

722
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:19.219
You know, you're just making things up

723
00:25:19.219 --> 00:25:21.523
because it's a good explanation for what you saw.

724
00:25:21.523 --> 00:25:22.579
That's not it.

725
00:25:22.579 --> 00:25:24.541
Science you have to do this

726
00:25:25.261 --> 00:25:26.775
ten different ways, you know.

727
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:27.948
You have to slice it and dice it

728
00:25:27.948 --> 00:25:29.027
from all different angles

729
00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.947
and you have to have consistency.

730
00:25:30.947 --> 00:25:32.952
If you can make it black instead of white

731
00:25:32.952 --> 00:25:34.821
can you also make it red and blue?

732
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:37.620
Does it matter? Can you make it change?

733
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.620
Can you make things that are diseased change colors?

734
00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:45.136
You know, be rainbow colors?

735
00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:46.598
Can you make 'em pulse on and off?

736
00:25:46.598 --> 00:25:48.336
And you can do anything.

737
00:25:48.336 --> 00:25:50.708
It's all your intent. How are you gonna see it?

738
00:25:50.708 --> 00:25:52.293
You're interpreting the data.

739
00:25:52.293 --> 00:25:54.326
It's how you want to interpreting that data.

740
00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:57.343
So our reality is personal.

741
00:25:57.343 --> 00:25:59.339
It's how we interpret the data.

742
00:25:59.339 --> 00:26:01.227
What we make of it.

743
00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:02.859
So two people may get the same data

744
00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:05.003
but have different interpretations.

745
00:26:05.003 --> 00:26:07.562
Well that's because they live in separate realities.

746
00:26:07.562 --> 00:26:09.280
We all live in our own reality.

747
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.560
<v Voiceover>Yeah and this is something,</v>

748
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.266
I mean you had to really dive headlong

749
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:15.061
into the field of quantum mechanics

750
00:26:15.061 --> 00:26:17.365
to really start making sense of a lot of this

751
00:26:17.365 --> 00:26:19.625
because none of what you were discovering

752
00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:24.625
really fits any classical scientific model.

753
00:26:24.719 --> 00:26:26.052
<v ->No, it doesn't.</v>

754
00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:28.090
And it took me a while before I understood

755
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.144
what was going on.

756
00:26:30.144 --> 00:26:31.719
And the thing that was nice,

757
00:26:31.719 --> 00:26:33.551
once I got some a-ha moments

758
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:34.789
that things were going on

759
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:36.410
and I got some help too, you know.

760
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.935
Because ideas would pop in my mind out of nowhere.

761
00:26:38.935 --> 00:26:40.652
So it wasn't just all me, you know.

762
00:26:40.652 --> 00:26:41.996
I was getting some help

763
00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:43.831
from my nonphysical friends.

764
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:46.838
And when I finally got the moment

765
00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.728
that I understood, you know,

766
00:26:48.728 --> 00:26:51.005
just everything kind of fit together.

767
00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:53.137
It all comes together and you say a-ha.

768
00:26:53.137 --> 00:26:55.292
You know, I see how it all works.

769
00:26:55.292 --> 00:26:56.764
And that's when I realized

770
00:26:56.764 --> 00:26:58.929
that I understood quantum mechanics.

771
00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:01.830
You know I was a physicists but I never really understood

772
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.507
why that particle was a probability distribution

773
00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:06.021
and how that really worked.

774
00:27:06.021 --> 00:27:07.973
And the advice that my professors gave me is,

775
00:27:07.973 --> 00:27:10.864
don't worry about it just do the calculations,

776
00:27:10.864 --> 00:27:12.601
we know it works.

777
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:14.053
I didn't like that, you know?

778
00:27:14.053 --> 00:27:15.642
That didn't sit well with me.

779
00:27:15.642 --> 00:27:17.039
<v Voiceover>Not good for inquiring minds.</v>

780
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.554
<v ->No, not good but it's,</v>

781
00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:21.482
so I worried over things like that

782
00:27:21.482 --> 00:27:23.177
and eventually I realized

783
00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:25.502
that the whole reality system,

784
00:27:25.502 --> 00:27:26.829
not just tiny things like

785
00:27:26.829 --> 00:27:28.012
quantum mechanics talks about

786
00:27:28.012 --> 00:27:29.355
the very very small,

787
00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:31.010
but the whole reality system works

788
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.131
in one consistent way.

789
00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:35.851
And that you could explain quantum mechanics

790
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:38.348
on this larger understanding of reality.

791
00:27:38.348 --> 00:27:40.533
And you could explain relativity from this

792
00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:42.336
larger understanding of reality.

793
00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:43.957
Relativity comes from C,

794
00:27:43.957 --> 00:27:45.333
the speed of light being constant.

795
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:47.850
And you can explain that as basically

796
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.253
the design criteria for the virtual reality that we're in.

797
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:53.439
And then that make sense.

798
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:55.614
Well okay, to have the reality we have,

799
00:27:56.264 --> 00:27:58.089
the way it works with our rule set,

800
00:27:58.089 --> 00:27:59.625
to be able to have, you know,

801
00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:01.683
differential calculus and smooth functions,

802
00:28:01.683 --> 00:28:04.343
and the rest of it, you need an isotropic homogeneous space

803
00:28:04.882 --> 00:28:07.815
In order to do that C has to be constant

804
00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:09.842
because this is a virtual reality.

805
00:28:09.842 --> 00:28:13.040
So the specification of

806
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.301
how much data and how much throughput

807
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:18.230
defines the constant and that's all it is.

808
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.504
It's just a design speck on the virtual reality.

809
00:28:21.504 --> 00:28:24.085
And you know, voila there it is.

810
00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:27.028
So then the two big issues in physics

811
00:28:27.028 --> 00:28:29.987
for the last 60 years is how do you describe

812
00:28:29.987 --> 00:28:31.786
quantum mechanics and relativity

813
00:28:31.786 --> 00:28:34.431
under just one over arching understanding.

814
00:28:34.431 --> 00:28:38.586
You know? One set of principles that explains both of those.

815
00:28:38.586 --> 00:28:40.410
Well that was what Einstein was trying to do

816
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.863
with his unified field theory.

817
00:28:42.863 --> 00:28:45.169
Suddenly they just fell out and I could see

818
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:46.437
where they were both coming from.

819
00:28:46.437 --> 00:28:47.962
The same...

820
00:28:47.962 --> 00:28:50.093
It's not like you had a separate explanation for both.

821
00:28:50.093 --> 00:28:51.980
One explanation and they both fall out.

822
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.976
Well now that's good physics, you know?

823
00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:56.194
So then you kind of get the idea,

824
00:28:56.194 --> 00:28:57.858
well if this thing explains physics

825
00:28:57.858 --> 00:28:59.757
and it explains metaphysics,

826
00:28:59.757 --> 00:29:01.036
maybe it's got something going for it.

827
00:29:01.036 --> 00:29:02.732
<v Voiceover>And this is My Big Toe.</v>

828
00:29:02.732 --> 00:29:05.280
Theory of Everything, Toe.

829
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.719
<v ->Yeah, of course Toe, Theory of Everything</v>

830
00:29:07.719 --> 00:29:08.844
is a term of physics, you know.

831
00:29:08.844 --> 00:29:12.283
Einstein was the first really scientific

832
00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:14.000
Toe, theory of everything

833
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.461
and that was unified field theory

834
00:29:15.461 --> 00:29:17.061
and that didn't work out for him.

835
00:29:17.061 --> 00:29:20.101
But it's big because it takes in

836
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:21.562
metaphysics and philosophy

837
00:29:21.562 --> 00:29:23.727
and theology as well as physics.

838
00:29:23.727 --> 00:29:26.159
And it's mine not because I'm proud of it,

839
00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.559
but because if you don't have the experience

840
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.307
you don't own the experience.

841
00:29:30.307 --> 00:29:31.545
<v Voiceover>And this is really big for you</v>

842
00:29:31.545 --> 00:29:32.783
because you're telling, I mean,

843
00:29:32.783 --> 00:29:35.163
yes you can lecture

844
00:29:35.163 --> 00:29:36.730
and explain theory and so fourth

845
00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.725
but you also have a practice element say,

846
00:29:38.725 --> 00:29:40.409
to conferences like this.

847
00:29:40.409 --> 00:29:43.365
But you're also saying at the same time,

848
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:46.060
there is no guru or anyone else who can

849
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.113
shift your consciousness.

850
00:29:48.113 --> 00:29:50.994
This still a practice that is very much your own.

851
00:29:50.994 --> 00:29:54.055
You have to take the time and work with it.

852
00:29:54.055 --> 00:29:55.697
It can't be given to you.

853
00:29:55.697 --> 00:29:59.174
It can't be theoretical and be yours.

854
00:29:59.174 --> 00:30:00.411
<v ->It has to be your experience.</v>

855
00:30:00.411 --> 00:30:01.798
And that's why it's My Big Toe.

856
00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:04.404
My just means that if it's not your experience

857
00:30:04.404 --> 00:30:05.961
it's not your knowledge.

858
00:30:05.961 --> 00:30:08.306
You can have an intellectual appreciation for it.

859
00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.843
I could explain it all to you

860
00:30:09.843 --> 00:30:11.645
and you could get it all intellectually

861
00:30:11.645 --> 00:30:15.960
but that's just a shadow of what's real.

862
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.445
It's not yours until it's your experience.

863
00:30:18.445 --> 00:30:20.483
When it's in your intellect you have two choices,

864
00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:22.946
you can believe it or you can not believe it.

865
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:25.228
Neither one is of any value.

866
00:30:25.228 --> 00:30:27.021
And it won't take you any place important.

867
00:30:27.021 --> 00:30:29.869
It's about growing up, it's about evolving.

868
00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:32.482
It's about changing yourself.

869
00:30:32.482 --> 00:30:36.343
And intellectual understanding doesn't do that for you.

870
00:30:36.343 --> 00:30:38.188
You have to get it at a being level.

871
00:30:38.188 --> 00:30:39.682
And it's at a deeper level.

872
00:30:39.682 --> 00:30:43.180
So just getting an intellectual appreciation is nice

873
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.940
and it may help you understand things

874
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.625
and it may be a catalyst to your growth

875
00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:47.799
because it may open your mind

876
00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:49.440
and you say, oh hey I see.

877
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.944
<v Voiceover>Maybe it gives you permission to explore.</v>

878
00:30:50.944 --> 00:30:52.279
<v ->Yes, permission.</v>

879
00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:54.347
So it's not that you can't help somebody.

880
00:30:54.347 --> 00:30:55.723
But you can't do it for them.

881
00:30:55.723 --> 00:30:57.781
You can't carry them across the finish line.

882
00:30:57.781 --> 00:30:59.883
They have to do it themselves.

883
00:30:59.883 --> 00:31:02.486
You can help them get prepared.

884
00:31:02.486 --> 00:31:04.181
You can produce an environment

885
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:05.920
that encourages their growth

886
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.478
but they have to grow.

887
00:31:07.478 --> 00:31:09.705
And that's true everywhere.

888
00:31:09.705 --> 00:31:13.866
It's not just true in exploring the larger reality.

889
00:31:13.866 --> 00:31:16.639
That's true if you and I are old friends

890
00:31:16.639 --> 00:31:19.402
and I'm trying to help you with a problem,

891
00:31:19.402 --> 00:31:21.684
I can't solve your problem for you.

892
00:31:21.684 --> 00:31:25.044
All I can do is provide for you an environment

893
00:31:25.044 --> 00:31:28.265
in which you can more easily solve the problem for yourself.

894
00:31:28.265 --> 00:31:30.835
And that's fundamentally true all over.

895
00:31:30.835 --> 00:31:34.440
You can't tell anybody anything really

896
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.678
as far as what they ought to do,

897
00:31:35.678 --> 00:31:36.617
or how they ought to do it,

898
00:31:36.617 --> 00:31:38.377
or what reality's like.

899
00:31:38.377 --> 00:31:40.579
They have to come to that on their own.

900
00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:41.987
You can only give them an environment

901
00:31:41.987 --> 00:31:43.299
that makes it easier for them

902
00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:44.579
but they have to do it.

903
00:31:44.579 --> 00:31:45.901
<v Voiceover>And as you say,</v>

904
00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:47.822
reality's highly subjective so that,

905
00:31:47.822 --> 00:31:50.467
even more so you can't tell someone what it's like.

906
00:31:50.467 --> 00:31:52.365
<v ->No, you can tell what it's like for you.</v>

907
00:31:52.365 --> 00:31:54.168
And that's a great mistake you see

908
00:31:54.168 --> 00:31:55.822
if you tell people what it's like for you

909
00:31:55.822 --> 00:31:57.304
then they think that's it because

910
00:31:57.304 --> 00:32:00.726
we all have this belief that it's objective.

911
00:32:00.726 --> 00:32:03.223
And Bob did this, you know.

912
00:32:03.223 --> 00:32:04.802
Bob's books were wonderful because

913
00:32:04.802 --> 00:32:06.925
he opened thousands of minds

914
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.802
to a larger reality.

915
00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:13.143
But he also convinced thousands of minds

916
00:32:13.143 --> 00:32:16.322
that this is the way that larger reality was.

917
00:32:16.322 --> 00:32:17.783
This is the way it was for Bob.

918
00:32:17.783 --> 00:32:19.431
This was Bob's interpretation.

919
00:32:19.431 --> 00:32:20.907
But most people think that's

920
00:32:20.907 --> 00:32:24.107
the objective reality and that's the way it is.

921
00:32:24.107 --> 00:32:26.731
And somewhere up there there's this park

922
00:32:26.731 --> 00:32:29.035
and there's this and all the things that Bob talked about.

923
00:32:29.035 --> 00:32:31.104
Well these were his own interpretations.

924
00:32:31.104 --> 00:32:32.255
And now you have people

925
00:32:32.255 --> 00:32:35.710
trying to reproduce Bob's experiences

926
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.377
because those are the real experiences.

927
00:32:38.377 --> 00:32:40.670
You see, and that's unfortunate.

928
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.811
Because they shouldn't be trying

929
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.304
to reproduce Bob's experiences,

930
00:32:43.304 --> 00:32:44.948
they should be having their own experiences,

931
00:32:44.948 --> 00:32:46.451
their own interpretations.

932
00:32:46.451 --> 00:32:50.366
But just having the experience is not that significant.

933
00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:53.735
You know, if having the experiences was significant

934
00:32:53.735 --> 00:32:55.369
then drugs would help you evolve.

935
00:32:55.369 --> 00:32:57.095
They could help you have an experience.

936
00:32:57.095 --> 00:32:59.707
But drugs are harmful to your evolution.

937
00:32:59.707 --> 00:33:01.434
So, it's not the experience,

938
00:33:01.434 --> 00:33:03.047
it's understanding the experience.

939
00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:04.710
It's growing from the experience.

940
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.725
It's being able to use that experience

941
00:33:06.725 --> 00:33:09.414
to get a bigger picture of reality.

942
00:33:09.414 --> 00:33:10.949
And to understand what you are,

943
00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:12.795
who you are and what you should be doing.

944
00:33:12.795 --> 00:33:15.173
If that experience doesn't do that for you

945
00:33:15.173 --> 00:33:17.413
then it's just an experience, why bother?

946
00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:19.173
It's just not that important.

947
00:33:19.173 --> 00:33:21.807
And people have to have their own experience.

948
00:33:21.807 --> 00:33:23.812
So when you tell, I have lots of people say,

949
00:33:23.812 --> 00:33:25.252
well Tom what's it like? You know?

950
00:33:25.252 --> 00:33:27.673
Tell me some of the things you've seen

951
00:33:27.673 --> 00:33:29.573
and some of the things you've done and so on.

952
00:33:29.573 --> 00:33:31.631
And they want stories.

953
00:33:31.631 --> 00:33:34.510
I don't tell stories because it actually

954
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.367
is not helpful to those people.

955
00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:37.711
It entertains them.

956
00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:39.204
It excites them.

957
00:33:39.204 --> 00:33:41.786
It may give them enthusiasm.

958
00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:44.025
But it also gives them a belief.

959
00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:46.232
Locks them into that's the way it is.

960
00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:48.649
Makes it harder for them to do it themselves.

961
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:51.828
So in a way I'm actually hurting their ability to grow

962
00:33:51.828 --> 00:33:54.867
by setting up another belief system in their mind

963
00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:57.011
that now they have to overcome.

964
00:33:57.011 --> 00:33:58.548
And that's just not--

965
00:33:58.548 --> 00:34:01.107
<v Voiceover>Or try to aspire to either way.</v>

966
00:34:01.107 --> 00:34:02.295
It's not theirs.

967
00:34:02.295 --> 00:34:04.535
<v ->It's not theirs and they don't need to either feel,</v>

968
00:34:04.535 --> 00:34:06.744
well gee I could never do that.

969
00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.238
That's harmful to them.

970
00:34:08.238 --> 00:34:09.486
And they don't have to feel,

971
00:34:09.486 --> 00:34:11.225
that's what I need to do.

972
00:34:11.225 --> 00:34:12.546
That's harmful to them.

973
00:34:12.546 --> 00:34:14.317
So I don't tell stories because

974
00:34:14.317 --> 00:34:17.038
it's just not helpful to people.

975
00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:20.344
And if you're not at a point where

976
00:34:20.344 --> 00:34:24.074
you are likely to have these experiences

977
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:27.172
then the story isn't going to help you.

978
00:34:27.172 --> 00:34:28.772
To have somebody else tell you about it

979
00:34:28.772 --> 00:34:29.904
is not helpful to you.

980
00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:31.343
It's counterproductive.

981
00:34:31.343 --> 00:34:33.732
Now if you already are having these experiences,

982
00:34:33.732 --> 00:34:35.386
sure you can trade and you can talk

983
00:34:35.386 --> 00:34:37.391
because they're common experiences.

984
00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:39.791
They're just different interpretations.

985
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:41.146
And that's fine.

986
00:34:41.146 --> 00:34:43.684
But it's not a thing that in a public broadcast

987
00:34:43.684 --> 00:34:44.751
where you're going to you know,

988
00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:46.169
thousands of people listening,

989
00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:47.929
you don't want to tell stories.

990
00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.529
You tell stories to people you know who also

991
00:34:49.529 --> 00:34:52.388
understand and they realize it's interpretation

992
00:34:52.388 --> 00:34:53.742
and you're not going to actually inhibit

993
00:34:53.742 --> 00:34:56.846
their own growth because of it.

994
00:34:56.846 --> 00:35:01.184
<v Voiceover>And today you talked about a lot of theory.</v>

995
00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:04.064
And it was interesting 'cause a lot of it was

996
00:35:04.064 --> 00:35:06.986
through the computer model of reality.

997
00:35:06.986 --> 00:35:09.664
Right? Or virtual reality.

998
00:35:09.664 --> 00:35:13.685
And we would spend probably the next eight hours

999
00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:15.795
you know, completing this interview

1000
00:35:15.795 --> 00:35:18.078
if we were to go into all of those tenants.

1001
00:35:18.078 --> 00:35:19.422
So what I thought we would do,

1002
00:35:19.422 --> 00:35:21.619
because people can certainly get in touch with you.

1003
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:23.133
They can come to one of your conferences.

1004
00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:25.202
They can purchase your books.

1005
00:35:25.202 --> 00:35:27.400
Any number of things to start getting into

1006
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.415
the fundamental principles behind

1007
00:35:30.415 --> 00:35:34.279
your big toe or My Big Toe as it is.

1008
00:35:34.279 --> 00:35:36.423
But I thought what we'd do is just

1009
00:35:36.423 --> 00:35:38.695
kind of toss out some things that happened

1010
00:35:38.695 --> 00:35:40.850
by way of ordinary or even

1011
00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.538
mild- phenomenal type of experience.

1012
00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:45.692
And you might explain to us

1013
00:35:45.692 --> 00:35:48.358
what kind of principles are at work

1014
00:35:48.358 --> 00:35:49.852
when these things happen.

1015
00:35:49.852 --> 00:35:50.918
Is that okay?

1016
00:35:50.918 --> 00:35:51.878
<v ->Sure let's do that.</v>

1017
00:35:51.878 --> 00:35:52.956
<v Voiceover>Okay, so for example,</v>

1018
00:35:52.956 --> 00:35:55.285
say someone decides they want to

1019
00:35:55.285 --> 00:35:57.941
know something about their future, right?

1020
00:35:58.601 --> 00:36:01.148
Maybe they haven't learned about creating.

1021
00:36:01.148 --> 00:36:04.326
What it means to literally create your own reality.

1022
00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:07.472
So you want to find out what your reality is going to be.

1023
00:36:07.472 --> 00:36:09.926
So you go to a psychic that has a

1024
00:36:09.926 --> 00:36:12.571
good reputation for kind of hooking in.

1025
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:15.088
And that person reflects information back to you

1026
00:36:15.088 --> 00:36:16.751
and some of it's ooh, ahh.

1027
00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:19.984
And maybe a person they talk about or described

1028
00:36:19.984 --> 00:36:22.106
even does end up entering your life

1029
00:36:22.106 --> 00:36:23.407
in a few months time.

1030
00:36:23.407 --> 00:36:25.711
But let's talk about what's really happening

1031
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:28.325
when your sitting with that intermediary.

1032
00:36:28.325 --> 00:36:30.510
<v ->Okay, well what's really going on there is that,</v>

1033
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.149
well we'll assume that this psychic

1034
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:33.774
that's doing it is a bonafide psychic

1035
00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:36.857
doing it and can actually do this.

1036
00:36:36.857 --> 00:36:41.163
And what you have is that the person

1037
00:36:41.163 --> 00:36:45.169
connects to what I call the probable future database.

1038
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:50.401
And that is part of how the larger system works.

1039
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:53.402
If you understand how consciousness works,

1040
00:36:53.402 --> 00:36:57.007
that consciousness is just information

1041
00:36:57.007 --> 00:37:00.964
then information stored is a database.

1042
00:37:00.964 --> 00:37:02.434
Okay and one of the databases

1043
00:37:02.434 --> 00:37:04.107
that is in the consciousness system

1044
00:37:04.107 --> 00:37:05.888
is the probable future database.

1045
00:37:05.888 --> 00:37:09.194
And that's all the things that we might do

1046
00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:11.733
and the probability that we might do them.

1047
00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:15.253
Okay and this reality of course is a shared,

1048
00:37:15.253 --> 00:37:17.493
it's a multiplayer game, you know?

1049
00:37:17.493 --> 00:37:19.488
We have a lot of us in it and we interact.

1050
00:37:19.488 --> 00:37:21.134
So it's the probability of those interactions.

1051
00:37:21.134 --> 00:37:22.051
You know, what we might do.

1052
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:22.947
What we might say.

1053
00:37:22.947 --> 00:37:23.608
How we might do it.

1054
00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:24.375
How we might take it.

1055
00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.347
How we would interpret it.

1056
00:37:25.347 --> 00:37:26.875
All the things that are possible

1057
00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:29.637
then are kind of worked out in probability

1058
00:37:29.637 --> 00:37:30.644
for everyone.

1059
00:37:30.644 --> 00:37:32.042
And you think, well gee that would be really hard.

1060
00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:33.183
I'm hard to guess, you know?

1061
00:37:33.183 --> 00:37:35.241
I'm a kind of a mysterious person

1062
00:37:35.241 --> 00:37:37.161
but it's not that hard to guess.

1063
00:37:37.161 --> 00:37:39.667
You have every thought, feeling, thing,

1064
00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:41.886
you've ever done since you've been here.

1065
00:37:41.886 --> 00:37:43.678
You're not that hard to guess.

1066
00:37:44.508 --> 00:37:46.348
<v Voiceover>That creates mathematical probabilities--</v>

1067
00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:49.345
<v ->Yes that creates probabilities of future events</v>

1068
00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:51.063
because there's a long history on you.

1069
00:37:51.063 --> 00:37:53.441
And it's not just history like the police have, right?

1070
00:37:53.441 --> 00:37:55.286
It's not just that you were arrested for this

1071
00:37:55.286 --> 00:37:56.587
or found doing that.

1072
00:37:56.587 --> 00:37:58.187
But this is every thought,

1073
00:37:58.187 --> 00:37:59.382
every feeling,

1074
00:37:59.382 --> 00:38:00.918
every intent,

1075
00:38:00.918 --> 00:38:02.038
that you've had.

1076
00:38:02.038 --> 00:38:03.286
Every dream, you know?

1077
00:38:03.286 --> 00:38:04.960
It's all the data.

1078
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.916
So it's not that hard to project

1079
00:38:06.916 --> 00:38:09.927
given the choices that are available

1080
00:38:09.927 --> 00:38:12.123
what that person's likely to do.

1081
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:14.268
And you're not projecting it,

1082
00:38:14.268 --> 00:38:16.166
what they're gonna a year from now.

1083
00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.905
You're only projecting what they're gonna do

1084
00:38:17.905 --> 00:38:19.888
in the next tiny increment of time.

1085
00:38:19.888 --> 00:38:22.544
You know? Tiny tiny increment of time.

1086
00:38:22.544 --> 00:38:24.422
Which is even easier.

1087
00:38:24.422 --> 00:38:26.876
And then you say well if that was the case,

1088
00:38:26.876 --> 00:38:28.639
if this was true, if that last projection

1089
00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.302
of the tiny increment was true,

1090
00:38:30.302 --> 00:38:31.917
we'll assume that's right now let's project

1091
00:38:31.917 --> 00:38:33.165
what the next increment will be

1092
00:38:33.165 --> 00:38:34.861
and the next one and you work your way out.

1093
00:38:34.861 --> 00:38:36.439
Well every time you do that you're making

1094
00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:38.242
an assumption that the last one was correct

1095
00:38:38.242 --> 00:38:39.938
which may not be a good assumption.

1096
00:38:39.938 --> 00:38:41.996
So your reliability goes down and down

1097
00:38:41.996 --> 00:38:43.378
and down the further out you can could go.

1098
00:38:43.378 --> 00:38:45.928
But you can run this out as far as you like.

1099
00:38:45.928 --> 00:38:48.989
And this is the probable future database.

1100
00:38:48.989 --> 00:38:50.866
Somebody has a precognitive dream?

1101
00:38:50.866 --> 00:38:52.253
That's where they get the data.

1102
00:38:52.253 --> 00:38:54.258
Somebody wants to tell a fortune?

1103
00:38:54.258 --> 00:38:56.145
That's how they tell the fortune.

1104
00:38:56.145 --> 00:38:58.443
They get into that database.

1105
00:38:58.443 --> 00:39:01.002
The database can be queried with intent.

1106
00:39:01.002 --> 00:39:02.326
And now these people doing it

1107
00:39:02.326 --> 00:39:03.723
don't know it's a database

1108
00:39:03.723 --> 00:39:05.429
and they're querying it with intent.

1109
00:39:05.429 --> 00:39:08.960
They have their certain tools that they use to do it.

1110
00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.198
Things that they do with their mind.

1111
00:39:10.198 --> 00:39:13.355
But the only active ingredient is consciousness.

1112
00:39:13.355 --> 00:39:17.291
Everything else is ritual, you know, and tools.

1113
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:20.170
They may have you sit on a throne or you know,

1114
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.434
incense and smoke or sprinkle holy water on you

1115
00:39:23.434 --> 00:39:25.354
or who knows what they might do, you know?

1116
00:39:25.354 --> 00:39:26.677
They may play certain music.

1117
00:39:26.677 --> 00:39:28.330
They may do all kinds of things.

1118
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.250
But that's just their tool set

1119
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.978
for focusing their mind

1120
00:39:31.978 --> 00:39:33.278
to get into this database

1121
00:39:33.278 --> 00:39:35.753
to find out what's probable for you.

1122
00:39:35.753 --> 00:39:37.513
And they also don't know it,

1123
00:39:37.513 --> 00:39:39.711
but you can get that data in any format you want.

1124
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:41.033
Most people get it in pictures

1125
00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:41.929
because as we all know,

1126
00:39:41.929 --> 00:39:43.337
a picture's worth a thousand words.

1127
00:39:43.337 --> 00:39:45.556
And you can get a lot of data in a picture

1128
00:39:45.556 --> 00:39:48.157
very very quickly, yeah, in symbols.

1129
00:39:48.157 --> 00:39:50.717
So they get symbols and metaphors

1130
00:39:50.717 --> 00:39:54.402
that they have to interpret in terms of that person.

1131
00:39:55.038 --> 00:39:58.237
And if you practice it you get good at it.

1132
00:39:58.237 --> 00:39:59.251
So that's what's going on.

1133
00:39:59.251 --> 00:40:01.533
They're reading these databases.

1134
00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:02.920
Now the Hindus call these databases

1135
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.605
the Akashic Records

1136
00:40:04.605 --> 00:40:05.941
They're just databases

1137
00:40:05.941 --> 00:40:08.202
in a digital information system

1138
00:40:08.202 --> 00:40:10.122
called consciousness.

1139
00:40:10.122 --> 00:40:12.181
So that's what that person's doing.

1140
00:40:12.181 --> 00:40:14.484
They're tuning into that future database

1141
00:40:14.484 --> 00:40:17.005
and if you practice it, like I said, you'll get good at it.

1142
00:40:17.534 --> 00:40:22.067
Astrology works pretty much the same way, okay?

1143
00:40:22.067 --> 00:40:24.552
That might be of interest to your listeners.

1144
00:40:24.552 --> 00:40:26.654
Astrology isn't about

1145
00:40:26.654 --> 00:40:28.318
where all the heavens are

1146
00:40:28.318 --> 00:40:29.992
in this way and that way.

1147
00:40:29.992 --> 00:40:31.356
Astrology is about

1148
00:40:31.356 --> 00:40:34.058
the consciousness of the astrologer.

1149
00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:36.778
If astrology was nothing more than placement

1150
00:40:36.778 --> 00:40:38.730
of heavenly bodies and then interperting

1151
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.915
what they say that means in the book,

1152
00:40:40.915 --> 00:40:43.608
computers would be much better astrologers than people

1153
00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:46.437
because computers could compute

1154
00:40:46.437 --> 00:40:49.716
all of those angles and exactly where they were

1155
00:40:49.716 --> 00:40:53.695
to fifty decimal places and be super accurate

1156
00:40:53.695 --> 00:40:56.243
more than a person could ever be.

1157
00:40:56.243 --> 00:40:59.023
Computers are lousy

1158
00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:01.256
at casting, you know, fortunes

1159
00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:02.419
or doing horoscopes.

1160
00:41:02.419 --> 00:41:03.432
They don't do a good job.

1161
00:41:03.432 --> 00:41:04.637
They do real general kind of things

1162
00:41:04.637 --> 00:41:06.034
but they're not very good at it

1163
00:41:06.034 --> 00:41:07.773
because that's not the point.

1164
00:41:07.773 --> 00:41:09.564
That's not what's going on.

1165
00:41:09.564 --> 00:41:14.564
All of the signs and the times and the rest of it,

1166
00:41:14.667 --> 00:41:17.260
there's a lot of interpretation in there.

1167
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.638
And in interpretation there's uncertainty.

1168
00:41:19.638 --> 00:41:21.206
You can interpret it this way or that way

1169
00:41:21.206 --> 00:41:23.321
it kind of gives you a general framework

1170
00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:25.240
but you have to interpret it.

1171
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.718
That interpretation is the astrologists consciousness

1172
00:41:29.718 --> 00:41:32.480
going into the database, getting the data,

1173
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.042
which is massaging the interpretation to make sense.

1174
00:41:36.042 --> 00:41:38.122
<v Voiceover>So it's their version of throwing the bones.</v>

1175
00:41:38.122 --> 00:41:39.542
<v ->Yes
<v Voiceover>It's a tool.</v>

1176
00:41:39.542 --> 00:41:40.640
<v ->It's a tool.</v>

1177
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.236
And people use all kinds of tools.

1178
00:41:42.236 --> 00:41:43.880
Throwing the bones is a tool.

1179
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.598
Reading the tea-leaves is a tool.

1180
00:41:47.286 --> 00:41:48.609
The crystal ball.

1181
00:41:48.609 --> 00:41:49.725
All of these things are things

1182
00:41:49.725 --> 00:41:51.820
that have uncertainty.

1183
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.607
Okay, you look at the tea-leaves

1184
00:41:53.607 --> 00:41:55.549
and all this stuff is there just swirling around

1185
00:41:55.549 --> 00:41:57.447
or you can make up a whole lot of things out of that.

1186
00:41:57.447 --> 00:41:59.027
You know, it's like the Rorschach test.

1187
00:41:59.027 --> 00:42:00.690
You can look at it and see all sorts of things.

1188
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.452
But what you see, if you're good at it,

1189
00:42:03.452 --> 00:42:05.212
is the imagery that you're getting

1190
00:42:05.212 --> 00:42:07.431
out of the future probable database.

1191
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:09.628
That's what you interpret it to be.

1192
00:42:09.628 --> 00:42:10.384
You know, you can interpret

1193
00:42:10.384 --> 00:42:11.303
the Rorschach inkblot

1194
00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:12.743
to be almost anything.

1195
00:42:12.743 --> 00:42:14.002
Same with the tea-leaves.

1196
00:42:14.002 --> 00:42:16.380
Same with the planets and the alignments and all that.

1197
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.100
They can be interpreted lots of different ways.

1198
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.446
The active ingredient is consciousness.

1199
00:42:21.446 --> 00:42:24.220
There are people I know who have a pendulum.

1200
00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.220
And the way they consult with their guides

1201
00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.958
is they hold this pendulum

1202
00:42:27.958 --> 00:42:30.624
and if it goes around this way it's a yes.

1203
00:42:30.624 --> 00:42:33.398
If it goes around that way it's a no.

1204
00:42:33.398 --> 00:42:34.401
Okay, well they hold it.

1205
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:37.558
Well the tiny little motions

1206
00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:39.424
that will make something turn like that

1207
00:42:39.424 --> 00:42:42.447
are really uncontrollable. Okay?

1208
00:42:42.447 --> 00:42:44.399
Well what happens is those tiny little motions

1209
00:42:44.399 --> 00:42:46.973
just happen to get controlled to produce

1210
00:42:46.973 --> 00:42:50.418
that they're asking about.

1211
00:42:50.418 --> 00:42:52.616
So if yes is a right answer

1212
00:42:52.616 --> 00:42:54.258
then that little tiny motion

1213
00:42:54.258 --> 00:42:55.794
turns into a yes.

1214
00:42:55.794 --> 00:42:56.733
If it's a no, it's a no.

1215
00:42:56.733 --> 00:42:59.719
So it's uncertainty in that servo system

1216
00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:03.612
that allows the system to manipulate the answer

1217
00:43:03.612 --> 00:43:06.876
to let that pendulum be an oracle. You see?

1218
00:43:06.876 --> 00:43:08.711
And we can make up all kinds of things.

1219
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:10.850
You know the people who have you hold your hand up

1220
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.487
and they say, you know,

1221
00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:13.876
do you like my baby sister?

1222
00:43:13.876 --> 00:43:15.497
And you say no and your hand goes down

1223
00:43:15.497 --> 00:43:16.709
and say, you do too! You know?

1224
00:43:16.709 --> 00:43:18.842
You were just lying there because, you know?

1225
00:43:18.842 --> 00:43:19.908
They do that sort of thing.

1226
00:43:19.908 --> 00:43:22.031
It's the same thing.

1227
00:43:22.031 --> 00:43:25.238
It's the conscious intent and they're using

1228
00:43:25.238 --> 00:43:28.321
very weak muscles that aren't used to strength

1229
00:43:28.321 --> 00:43:31.720
and because it's very subtle about those muscles

1230
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.910
the system can make that like the pendulum

1231
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:35.867
like the bones--

1232
00:43:35.867 --> 00:43:37.733
<v Voiceover>And they can all be extremely effective.</v>

1233
00:43:37.733 --> 00:43:39.312
<v ->Yes they can all be extremely effective</v>

1234
00:43:39.312 --> 00:43:41.627
but it depends on the person doing it.

1235
00:43:41.627 --> 00:43:43.215
It's that consciousness tint.

1236
00:43:43.215 --> 00:43:44.794
So then of course the scientists come in

1237
00:43:44.794 --> 00:43:46.309
and they say oh bogus!

1238
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:48.346
Look okay, I'm gonna do it, you know?

1239
00:43:48.346 --> 00:43:50.415
And you Joe, my assistant, you stand up there.

1240
00:43:50.415 --> 00:43:51.695
It doesn't work.

1241
00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:53.167
Well of course it doesn't work.

1242
00:43:53.167 --> 00:43:54.692
You know?

1243
00:43:54.692 --> 00:43:57.454
Neither of them know how to access, you know,

1244
00:43:57.454 --> 00:43:58.734
the probable future database.

1245
00:43:58.734 --> 00:44:01.913
None of them can get into the past databases.

1246
00:44:01.913 --> 00:44:03.673
They're incompetent to do that.

1247
00:44:03.673 --> 00:44:05.273
It's not gonna work because

1248
00:44:05.273 --> 00:44:07.652
that's the active ingredient.

1249
00:44:07.652 --> 00:44:11.504
But people think the tools are really what matters.

1250
00:44:12.033 --> 00:44:13.675
It's not the tools.

1251
00:44:13.675 --> 00:44:15.381
It's not objective.

1252
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:18.518
It's consciousness is the active ingredient.

1253
00:44:18.518 --> 00:44:21.334
So no, you can't get a computer,

1254
00:44:21.334 --> 00:44:24.155
You can't get a computer to give you a good horoscope.

1255
00:44:24.465 --> 00:44:25.675
It's not the tools.

1256
00:44:25.675 --> 00:44:26.366
So well then you say well then

1257
00:44:26.366 --> 00:44:27.710
horoscopes don't mean anything

1258
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.638
because look you told me what

1259
00:44:28.638 --> 00:44:29.642
each one of these things mean.

1260
00:44:29.642 --> 00:44:31.423
I did it, I did the calculation.

1261
00:44:31.423 --> 00:44:32.798
It wasn't right.

1262
00:44:32.798 --> 00:44:34.782
Well, well it's not gonna be right.

1263
00:44:34.782 --> 00:44:36.136
That's not how it works.

1264
00:44:36.136 --> 00:44:38.322
It's consciousness is the ingredient

1265
00:44:38.322 --> 00:44:40.011
that makes all those things work.

1266
00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:40.855
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about something</v>

1267
00:44:40.855 --> 00:44:41.890
you brought up twice now.

1268
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.130
You talked about, you got a little help

1269
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.071
from your nonphysical friends.

1270
00:44:46.071 --> 00:44:48.097
And when you were a little kid

1271
00:44:48.097 --> 00:44:49.815
you used to have a fair amount of contact

1272
00:44:49.815 --> 00:44:51.617
with nonphysical friends.

1273
00:44:51.617 --> 00:44:54.295
But earlier in the lecture you were talking about,

1274
00:44:54.295 --> 00:44:58.134
it may not, our guides, the beings that we

1275
00:44:58.134 --> 00:45:00.332
feel and refer to in our own minds

1276
00:45:00.332 --> 00:45:04.011
and develop our own perceived relationships with,

1277
00:45:05.091 --> 00:45:07.531
maybe I didn't understand what you were saying.

1278
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:10.165
You mentioned that it's not as though these

1279
00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:11.947
guides are sitting around waiting for

1280
00:45:11.947 --> 00:45:14.410
an impulse from us or a request

1281
00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.202
because they'd be bored out of their gourd.

1282
00:45:16.202 --> 00:45:20.085
If that was the sole objective was to hang around

1283
00:45:20.085 --> 00:45:21.930
and wait for a person to request something.

1284
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.184
You said it's something more that's

1285
00:45:23.184 --> 00:45:25.577
born out of the need in the moment.

1286
00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:27.667
Can you explain that?

1287
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:33.333
Our guides, though this is just a word guides.

1288
00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:35.398
That's kind of a new age word, right?

1289
00:45:35.398 --> 00:45:38.077
What it is, it's our interface.

1290
00:45:38.077 --> 00:45:39.823
It's our personal interface

1291
00:45:39.823 --> 00:45:41.999
with the larger consciousness system.

1292
00:45:41.999 --> 00:45:44.698
That's how the larger consciousness system

1293
00:45:44.698 --> 00:45:47.033
communicates with us, interfaces with us.

1294
00:45:47.033 --> 00:45:48.420
Now it might not be guides,

1295
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.700
it might be your intuition.

1296
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.193
Some people have very strong intuitions

1297
00:45:51.193 --> 00:45:53.809
that kind of tells them what to do and what not to do.

1298
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:56.070
Whether to turn right or turn left.

1299
00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:00.030
And those that personalize that

1300
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.372
call it guides.

1301
00:46:02.372 --> 00:46:04.911
So guides is a metaphor.

1302
00:46:04.911 --> 00:46:07.398
It's not a being, like I say, sitting there,

1303
00:46:07.398 --> 00:46:08.363
you know, watching every,

1304
00:46:08.363 --> 00:46:10.186
just waiting for you to ask them a question.

1305
00:46:10.186 --> 00:46:12.021
You know? To come at your beck and call.

1306
00:46:12.021 --> 00:46:15.584
It's the larger consciousness system interfacing with you.

1307
00:46:15.584 --> 00:46:17.866
If you have a need, if you ask the question,

1308
00:46:17.866 --> 00:46:19.605
if you communicate with that guide,

1309
00:46:19.605 --> 00:46:22.205
the larger consciousness system will communicate with you.

1310
00:46:22.638 --> 00:46:25.177
And it will use a constant interface.

1311
00:46:25.177 --> 00:46:26.734
The interface isn't gonna change all the time.

1312
00:46:26.734 --> 00:46:28.216
That would be confusing.

1313
00:46:28.216 --> 00:46:30.040
So you get to know these guides.

1314
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.502
You get to, you know, they have personalities.

1315
00:46:32.502 --> 00:46:34.039
They have senses of humor.

1316
00:46:34.039 --> 00:46:36.182
<v Voiceover>Yeah, very specific. Yeah.</v>

1317
00:46:36.182 --> 00:46:38.176
<v ->Yeah, they're like individuals</v>

1318
00:46:38.176 --> 00:46:40.758
but that you have an individual interface.

1319
00:46:40.758 --> 00:46:43.339
And that is your interface then with the larger system.

1320
00:46:43.339 --> 00:46:44.982
Sometimes you have two guides.

1321
00:46:44.982 --> 00:46:46.934
Sometimes you have three guides, you know?

1322
00:46:46.934 --> 00:46:48.074
It's this sort of thing.

1323
00:46:48.074 --> 00:46:49.621
And you get this relationship built up.

1324
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:51.165
But that's your relationship

1325
00:46:51.165 --> 00:46:52.925
with the larger consciousness system.

1326
00:46:52.925 --> 00:46:56.285
You just make a metaphor in your mind

1327
00:46:56.285 --> 00:46:59.292
that that's a guide because you can't conceive

1328
00:46:59.292 --> 00:47:02.768
of it being any other thing than another person.

1329
00:47:02.768 --> 00:47:04.326
See, that's your model.

1330
00:47:04.326 --> 00:47:06.129
That's your belief system.

1331
00:47:06.129 --> 00:47:08.165
If it's somebody I'm talking to that's talking with me

1332
00:47:08.165 --> 00:47:10.492
and I'm having a conversation then it's a person.

1333
00:47:10.492 --> 00:47:13.029
If it's a person, it's a separate person from me.

1334
00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:15.569
So it's like me and this person.

1335
00:47:15.569 --> 00:47:17.147
We're two individuals, were' having this talk.

1336
00:47:17.147 --> 00:47:19.003
I ask questions, he helps me out.

1337
00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:20.527
You know, we whatever.

1338
00:47:20.527 --> 00:47:23.087
We turn that into another individual

1339
00:47:23.087 --> 00:47:25.563
sort of like us but knows more.

1340
00:47:25.563 --> 00:47:28.141
That's just our way of interpreting

1341
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:30.189
that interface with the larger conscious system.

1342
00:47:30.189 --> 00:47:31.502
<v Voiceover>But that's fine.</v>

1343
00:47:31.502 --> 00:47:32.429
You can give 'em a name.

1344
00:47:32.429 --> 00:47:33.687
You can give 'em a turban.

1345
00:47:33.687 --> 00:47:35.513
Anything you want.

1346
00:47:35.513 --> 00:47:37.514
And it doesn't matter.

1347
00:47:37.514 --> 00:47:39.989
<v ->It matters not at all.</v>

1348
00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:41.525
It's for our convenience.

1349
00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.210
It makes us feel better.

1350
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.447
You know, we do this all the time.

1351
00:47:44.447 --> 00:47:46.890
When people go visit Uncle Fred,

1352
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.972
you know, who died 10 years ago.

1353
00:47:49.972 --> 00:47:52.841
For some reason Uncle Fred's wearing the same suit

1354
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:57.069
that he wore, you know, when he was here.

1355
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:58.387
The way they remember him.

1356
00:47:58.387 --> 00:48:00.926
He's dressed in the same period cloths.

1357
00:48:00.926 --> 00:48:02.280
He's wearing the same kind of stuff.

1358
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.989
He's still playing the ukulele just like he used to.

1359
00:48:04.989 --> 00:48:07.282
So we have this image of Uncle Fred.

1360
00:48:07.282 --> 00:48:09.245
Well you think Uncle Fred is just sitting there

1361
00:48:09.245 --> 00:48:10.589
playing his ukulele, you know,

1362
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:11.965
waiting for us to call him back

1363
00:48:11.965 --> 00:48:13.447
so he can interact with us?

1364
00:48:13.447 --> 00:48:15.986
Of course not, Uncle Fred's way gone.

1365
00:48:15.986 --> 00:48:18.664
This is an interface with the larger system.

1366
00:48:18.664 --> 00:48:21.361
This is Uncle Fred in the historical database.

1367
00:48:21.361 --> 00:48:22.780
This is the model of Uncle Fred

1368
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.838
without freewill that I was talking about.

1369
00:48:24.838 --> 00:48:26.866
Okay so, yes you can do that

1370
00:48:26.866 --> 00:48:29.243
but why is he dressed like that?

1371
00:48:29.243 --> 00:48:31.440
Well, that's because that's comfortable for us.

1372
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.126
That's the way we remember him.

1373
00:48:33.126 --> 00:48:35.740
That's to us the essence of Uncle Fred.

1374
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.643
So of course that's our interpretation of Uncle Fred.

1375
00:48:39.643 --> 00:48:42.865
Now what happens when it's somebody we don't know?

1376
00:48:42.865 --> 00:48:44.059
Well we don't know how to dress them

1377
00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:45.082
because we don't know them.

1378
00:48:45.082 --> 00:48:46.662
What do we do? We put a robe on 'em.

1379
00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:48.809
All these people wear robes because

1380
00:48:49.422 --> 00:48:51.746
a robe is a fashion that never goes out.

1381
00:48:51.746 --> 00:48:53.880
Right? Everybody wears robes.

1382
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.259
And if we don't really,

1383
00:48:57.003 --> 00:48:59.124
to the detail of what they look like,

1384
00:48:59.124 --> 00:49:00.363
then they have a hood over their robe

1385
00:49:00.363 --> 00:49:02.325
and we really can't see their face because

1386
00:49:02.325 --> 00:49:03.807
if we saw their face then that would

1387
00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.887
set up a whole bunch of another inquiry for us.

1388
00:49:05.887 --> 00:49:07.306
Who was it and why?

1389
00:49:07.306 --> 00:49:08.585
So we don't need that.

1390
00:49:08.585 --> 00:49:10.942
So if we don't need that we don't get that.

1391
00:49:10.942 --> 00:49:11.925
So we get a robe figure,

1392
00:49:11.925 --> 00:49:12.967
we really can't see the face.

1393
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:15.281
It doesn't matter. We communicate just the same.

1394
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:18.441
So all of that is what we bring to the table.

1395
00:49:18.441 --> 00:49:20.520
It doesn't mean that that isn't real.

1396
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.939
That it isn't a real communication.

1397
00:49:21.939 --> 00:49:26.259
It just means that for it to communicate to us

1398
00:49:26.259 --> 00:49:28.797
it needs to take that form so we recognize it.

1399
00:49:28.797 --> 00:49:31.634
If it didn't have Uncle Fred's cloths on playing a ukulele,

1400
00:49:31.634 --> 00:49:33.320
we wouldn't know that it Uncle Fred.

1401
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.240
But we recognize it immediately.

1402
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.279
Okay so, the larger conscious system

1403
00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:40.114
is communicating with us.

1404
00:49:40.114 --> 00:49:41.895
If it's communicating with us with about Uncle Fred

1405
00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:43.601
then it looks like Uncle Fred.

1406
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:45.458
If it's communicating about something else

1407
00:49:45.458 --> 00:49:48.799
it may look like, you know, some other figure.

1408
00:49:48.799 --> 00:49:50.398
If you happened to be very religious

1409
00:49:50.398 --> 00:49:51.861
it might look like Mary.

1410
00:49:51.861 --> 00:49:55.540
If you happened to be some other religion

1411
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.781
it may look like one of your ancestors

1412
00:49:57.781 --> 00:49:59.160
come to talk with you.

1413
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.486
You know, it's just how you,

1414
00:50:01.486 --> 00:50:03.426
it's the model of reality you build up

1415
00:50:03.426 --> 00:50:05.540
in your own mind, in your own beliefs.

1416
00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.127
And you have to communicate

1417
00:50:07.127 --> 00:50:09.665
to somebody through that filter.

1418
00:50:09.665 --> 00:50:10.806
Otherwise they won't get it.

1419
00:50:10.806 --> 00:50:12.023
They won't understand.

1420
00:50:12.023 --> 00:50:13.504
So the larger consciousness systems

1421
00:50:13.504 --> 00:50:14.903
communicates with you in a way

1422
00:50:14.903 --> 00:50:16.634
that makes sense to you.

1423
00:50:16.634 --> 00:50:18.767
So your guides just form up out of the

1424
00:50:18.767 --> 00:50:20.889
consciousness system and communicate with you.

1425
00:50:20.889 --> 00:50:24.825
But it's a constant, consistent, interface.

1426
00:50:24.825 --> 00:50:26.392
It's your personal interface.

1427
00:50:26.392 --> 00:50:27.747
<v Voiceover>Well let's talk about something that</v>

1428
00:50:27.747 --> 00:50:31.566
might be beyond just personal and where there's

1429
00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:34.809
a shared perception that's happening.

1430
00:50:34.809 --> 00:50:37.828
From as you say, a historical bit in a database.

1431
00:50:37.828 --> 00:50:39.362
And I'll give an example.

1432
00:50:39.362 --> 00:50:40.803
One time I was in a group.

1433
00:50:40.803 --> 00:50:42.146
We were doing some intuitive work

1434
00:50:42.146 --> 00:50:45.070
and people, one at a time,

1435
00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:48.322
would go on a journey after an event.

1436
00:50:48.322 --> 00:50:50.327
So that they were pretty loose in their consciousness

1437
00:50:50.327 --> 00:50:51.724
and they'd go on a journey.

1438
00:50:51.724 --> 00:50:53.571
And sometimes I'd tag along with them.

1439
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:55.244
Just for kicks.

1440
00:50:55.244 --> 00:50:57.783
And be exactly where they were,

1441
00:50:57.783 --> 00:50:59.190
with who they were with,

1442
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.122
seeing exactly what they were seeing.

1443
00:51:01.122 --> 00:51:03.287
So in this kind of experience

1444
00:51:03.287 --> 00:51:04.342
what's happening?

1445
00:51:04.342 --> 00:51:05.708
'Cause it was good only in that

1446
00:51:05.708 --> 00:51:08.385
it was a validation for some people--

1447
00:51:08.385 --> 00:51:09.729
<v Voiceover>That's very much like Dennis and I</v>

1448
00:51:09.729 --> 00:51:11.168
taking an out of body trip together.

1449
00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:12.406
It's the same sort of thing.

1450
00:51:12.406 --> 00:51:13.635
<v Voiceover>So you're going to a historical</v>

1451
00:51:13.635 --> 00:51:15.995
artifact together?

1452
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.626
So it doesn't have to be,

1453
00:51:19.626 --> 00:51:21.045
and the only reason I bring it up

1454
00:51:21.045 --> 00:51:24.011
is because it's been, as you say,

1455
00:51:24.011 --> 00:51:27.467
suspended or conjured in a way to have familiarity.

1456
00:51:27.467 --> 00:51:29.611
It's just that another person could go along,

1457
00:51:29.611 --> 00:51:31.371
or multiple people can go along

1458
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:33.066
and experience that same artifact.

1459
00:51:33.066 --> 00:51:34.239
<v ->They can and what they're doing</v>

1460
00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:37.088
is they are sharing the experience.

1461
00:51:37.088 --> 00:51:39.370
Okay, we are consciousness.

1462
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.044
Consciousness is all netted.

1463
00:51:41.044 --> 00:51:43.134
We communicate all the time.

1464
00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:46.911
We can kind of link and share our consciousness.

1465
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:49.150
Another aspect of shared consciousness.

1466
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:50.484
And we share consciousness,

1467
00:51:50.484 --> 00:51:53.289
we can do things together.

1468
00:51:53.289 --> 00:51:56.350
We can like have a single shared experience.

1469
00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:59.070
You can stand behind somebody at a lunch counter

1470
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:00.760
and taste what they're eating.

1471
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.778
You know? You can just taste the pickle they're chewing.

1472
00:52:03.778 --> 00:52:08.120
You know? And you can get into their reality like that.

1473
00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.400
It's data.

1474
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.419
And if you understand how

1475
00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:11.879
you can access that data.

1476
00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:14.322
So you can share another person's experience.

1477
00:52:14.322 --> 00:52:16.039
You can look through their eyes.

1478
00:52:16.039 --> 00:52:17.563
You can feel their feelings,

1479
00:52:17.563 --> 00:52:18.961
see what they're seeing,

1480
00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:20.679
and be a part of that experience.

1481
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:24.060
If you take that to a little wider thing,

1482
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.395
you're talking about group consciousness.

1483
00:52:26.395 --> 00:52:29.403
Now group consciousness is basically,

1484
00:52:29.403 --> 00:52:31.364
I use math terms but it's a vector sum

1485
00:52:31.364 --> 00:52:33.485
of all the consciousness that are in the group.

1486
00:52:33.485 --> 00:52:37.220
If the group has a very low intent

1487
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.526
then we call that mob consciousness, right?

1488
00:52:40.526 --> 00:52:42.841
And we know that it degenerates to the very lowest

1489
00:52:42.841 --> 00:52:44.301
common denominator in the mob.

1490
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:46.243
And there's a lot of people in that mob acting

1491
00:52:46.243 --> 00:52:49.421
worse than they would ever act by themselves.

1492
00:52:49.421 --> 00:52:52.056
Well, that group consciousness descends

1493
00:52:52.056 --> 00:52:53.965
to the lowest common denominator

1494
00:52:53.965 --> 00:52:55.245
among all those consciousness,

1495
00:52:55.245 --> 00:52:56.664
the vector sum there.

1496
00:52:56.664 --> 00:52:59.257
The same thing happens on the other side.

1497
00:52:59.257 --> 00:53:00.888
You have a lot of people together who are

1498
00:53:00.888 --> 00:53:02.795
growing, loving, caring,

1499
00:53:02.795 --> 00:53:04.502
and supportive of each other,

1500
00:53:04.502 --> 00:53:05.985
They pull each other up.

1501
00:53:05.985 --> 00:53:08.576
Just like in the mob they drag each other down.

1502
00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:09.761
They pull each other up.

1503
00:53:09.761 --> 00:53:11.799
That's a group consciousness effect.

1504
00:53:11.799 --> 00:53:14.295
And then, you know, that's the hundredth monkey.

1505
00:53:14.295 --> 00:53:16.141
The hundredth monkey effect is that

1506
00:53:16.141 --> 00:53:17.612
they're all apart of a group,

1507
00:53:17.612 --> 00:53:18.721
they're sharing.

1508
00:53:18.721 --> 00:53:19.820
The consciousness is sharing.

1509
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.329
The experience is sharing.

1510
00:53:21.329 --> 00:53:23.302
So people learn because somebody else

1511
00:53:23.302 --> 00:53:25.426
learned in their group and they're sharing it.

1512
00:53:25.426 --> 00:53:29.244
So it's a big up kind of experience for them.

1513
00:53:29.244 --> 00:53:31.718
And then you have even a bigger thing that's

1514
00:53:31.718 --> 00:53:35.484
let's say human wide or cultural wide

1515
00:53:35.484 --> 00:53:39.802
and now you're looking at Jung's Archetypes.

1516
00:53:39.802 --> 00:53:42.939
Where we all have certain kinds of symbols.

1517
00:53:42.939 --> 00:53:45.776
All across humanity in all kinds of cultures.

1518
00:53:45.776 --> 00:53:48.603
You know? We all have these symbols.

1519
00:53:48.603 --> 00:53:50.704
And those are kind of group mind

1520
00:53:50.704 --> 00:53:52.421
at the species level.

1521
00:53:52.421 --> 00:53:54.096
So you have all of this going on.

1522
00:53:54.096 --> 00:53:57.604
But the fundamental unit is an individual.

1523
00:53:57.604 --> 00:53:59.781
And you can share or you can not share.

1524
00:53:59.781 --> 00:54:01.359
It depends on your intent.

1525
00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:03.215
You have to intentionally share.

1526
00:54:03.215 --> 00:54:04.643
If you don't wanna share

1527
00:54:04.643 --> 00:54:05.796
you can turn that off

1528
00:54:05.796 --> 00:54:07.215
just like turning off a radio.

1529
00:54:07.215 --> 00:54:08.761
And you're not a part of it.

1530
00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:10.617
<v Voiceover>Okay, I have another one for you then.</v>

1531
00:54:10.617 --> 00:54:12.463
Now this is another personal one

1532
00:54:12.463 --> 00:54:14.735
that Scott and I have talked about.

1533
00:54:14.735 --> 00:54:16.697
My son and I have certainly talked about a lot

1534
00:54:16.697 --> 00:54:18.062
because it involves him.

1535
00:54:18.062 --> 00:54:20.580
My son, almost since his birth,

1536
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.638
who is now 27 years old.

1537
00:54:22.638 --> 00:54:25.340
We seem to be experiencing,

1538
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:28.308
it's our own version like you and Dennis,

1539
00:54:28.308 --> 00:54:31.359
but virtually the same reality

1540
00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:33.204
throughout our whole lives.

1541
00:54:33.204 --> 00:54:35.242
And we don't, it's not contrived,

1542
00:54:35.242 --> 00:54:36.906
we'll find out afterward but

1543
00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:39.519
it can be as bizarre as,

1544
00:54:39.519 --> 00:54:40.959
he'll dislocate his shoulder

1545
00:54:40.959 --> 00:54:43.465
and I'll sprain my ankle the same day.

1546
00:54:43.465 --> 00:54:45.364
Or we both got a speeding ticket

1547
00:54:45.364 --> 00:54:46.942
in different cities the same morning.

1548
00:54:46.942 --> 00:54:49.982
Ended up in the same speeding school class.

1549
00:54:49.982 --> 00:54:51.187
That the instructor didn't think

1550
00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:53.320
that was very responsible of me.

1551
00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.846
But it can be everything from

1552
00:54:54.846 --> 00:54:56.659
down to the thoughts we're having.

1553
00:54:56.659 --> 00:54:57.725
We'll happen to talk.

1554
00:54:57.725 --> 00:54:59.197
Maybe we haven't talked in a week or so

1555
00:54:59.197 --> 00:55:00.797
and you know, I've been thinking about this.

1556
00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.824
And the other one will have been literally

1557
00:55:02.824 --> 00:55:04.466
contemplating the exact same thing.

1558
00:55:04.466 --> 00:55:07.517
But it's like that almost everyday of our lives.

1559
00:55:07.517 --> 00:55:09.202
What's happening there?

1560
00:55:09.202 --> 00:55:10.343
<v ->You're sharing.</v>

1561
00:55:10.343 --> 00:55:12.125
Your consciousness and his consciousness

1562
00:55:12.125 --> 00:55:14.715
are sharing a lot of data and a lot of experience.

1563
00:55:14.715 --> 00:55:16.583
You're very close.

1564
00:55:16.583 --> 00:55:18.758
You know we can use another analogy.

1565
00:55:18.758 --> 00:55:20.721
People overwork this frequency analogy,

1566
00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:22.406
but you know say, like you're tuned.

1567
00:55:22.406 --> 00:55:23.328
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's what I feel.</v>

1568
00:55:23.328 --> 00:55:25.089
That it's a frequency thing, yeah.

1569
00:55:25.089 --> 00:55:26.612
<v ->Of course frequency is just a metaphor.</v>

1570
00:55:26.612 --> 00:55:28.086
It doesn't have anything to do with frequency.

1571
00:55:28.086 --> 00:55:30.436
Frequency's a physical matter thing.

1572
00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:32.278
<v Voiceover>Is it better to say a resonance?</v>

1573
00:55:32.278 --> 00:55:34.912
<v ->Yeah, you could say a resonance is better.</v>

1574
00:55:34.912 --> 00:55:37.472
So you have this closeness that resonates.

1575
00:55:37.472 --> 00:55:40.010
In his mind his intent

1576
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.861
touches you all the time.

1577
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:46.666
He has an intent that kind of captures you

1578
00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:48.126
and holds you in the back of his mind,

1579
00:55:48.126 --> 00:55:49.205
so you're there.

1580
00:55:49.205 --> 00:55:51.018
You do the same thing to him.

1581
00:55:51.018 --> 00:55:52.746
<v Voiceover>Even though it's totally unconscious?</v>

1582
00:55:52.746 --> 00:55:54.185
<v ->Even though it's totally unconscious.</v>

1583
00:55:54.185 --> 00:55:56.084
You and he are close enough that he's a part of you

1584
00:55:56.084 --> 00:55:58.206
and you're a part of him all the time.

1585
00:55:58.206 --> 00:55:59.443
We're netted.

1586
00:55:59.443 --> 00:56:01.704
We communicate all the time.

1587
00:56:01.704 --> 00:56:03.902
The two of you just communicate a lot more

1588
00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:06.601
than you do, say, with other people.

1589
00:56:06.601 --> 00:56:08.499
You constantly have this going back and fourth.

1590
00:56:08.499 --> 00:56:11.017
Your realities then tend to run parallel.

1591
00:56:11.017 --> 00:56:14.120
To an enlarged extent, as I discussed today,

1592
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.222
you create your own reality.

1593
00:56:16.222 --> 00:56:17.768
Well, you two are on the same wavelength.

1594
00:56:17.768 --> 00:56:19.046
You're gonna create,

1595
00:56:19.046 --> 00:56:20.925
you're gonna interpret things similarly.

1596
00:56:20.925 --> 00:56:23.379
You're gonna kind of create a similar reality.

1597
00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:25.405
You're connected.

1598
00:56:25.405 --> 00:56:29.565
And that's often between mothers and sons.

1599
00:56:29.565 --> 00:56:31.101
Mothers and daughters, you know?

1600
00:56:31.101 --> 00:56:33.458
It's between best friends that grew up together

1601
00:56:33.458 --> 00:56:35.698
and have always been best friends their whole life.

1602
00:56:35.698 --> 00:56:38.246
They know when each other is in trouble.

1603
00:56:38.246 --> 00:56:40.444
One picks up the phone and says I just thought I'd call.

1604
00:56:40.444 --> 00:56:42.300
And the other one's just having a crisis.

1605
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.879
They're connected.

1606
00:56:43.879 --> 00:56:46.886
And we share with all consciousness.

1607
00:56:46.886 --> 00:56:48.358
So if there's somebody on the other side

1608
00:56:48.358 --> 00:56:50.161
of this planet somewhere,

1609
00:56:50.161 --> 00:56:52.485
we can share with that person.

1610
00:56:52.485 --> 00:56:54.385
Or we can shut them out.

1611
00:56:54.385 --> 00:56:57.307
We tend to share more with the people we love

1612
00:56:57.307 --> 00:56:58.949
and care about and are close to.

1613
00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:01.626
We tend to shut out those that we don't know

1614
00:57:01.626 --> 00:57:02.823
because it's too much.

1615
00:57:02.823 --> 00:57:04.786
We can't deal with all that information.

1616
00:57:04.786 --> 00:57:08.679
Sometimes the people who are diagnosed

1617
00:57:08.679 --> 00:57:10.801
as schizophrenic or mentally ill

1618
00:57:10.801 --> 00:57:12.283
just can't shut it out.

1619
00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:13.862
They don't know how to turn it off.

1620
00:57:13.862 --> 00:57:15.025
And they do hear voices

1621
00:57:15.025 --> 00:57:16.081
and they hear stuff all the time

1622
00:57:16.081 --> 00:57:17.819
and it's very confusing to them.

1623
00:57:17.819 --> 00:57:19.899
And of course the diagnosis is they're crazy.

1624
00:57:19.899 --> 00:57:23.185
But basically they are hearing real voices.

1625
00:57:23.185 --> 00:57:24.219
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1626
00:57:24.219 --> 00:57:27.782
<v ->They just don't have the filter to filter it out</v>

1627
00:57:27.782 --> 00:57:30.117
and the rest of us filter it out naturally.

1628
00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:31.845
Eventually once you understand reality

1629
00:57:31.845 --> 00:57:33.476
you can filter it out selectively.

1630
00:57:33.476 --> 00:57:36.240
You can kind of turn it on, turn it off as you want.

1631
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.287
It's individual.

1632
00:57:38.287 --> 00:57:39.929
But that's going on with your intent.

1633
00:57:39.929 --> 00:57:42.906
You have lots of intentions that aren't intellectual.

1634
00:57:42.906 --> 00:57:44.623
They never get to your intellect.

1635
00:57:44.623 --> 00:57:46.009
You have a lot of intentions.

1636
00:57:46.009 --> 00:57:47.321
Things that you feel. Things that you want.

1637
00:57:47.321 --> 00:57:48.995
Things that you're interested in.

1638
00:57:48.995 --> 00:57:52.035
They all, you know, are part of your consciousness.

1639
00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:54.438
And all of those things are resonating

1640
00:57:54.438 --> 00:57:56.881
with wherever they happen to go.

1641
00:57:56.881 --> 00:57:57.822
Wherever they happen to be.

1642
00:57:57.822 --> 00:57:59.753
Wherever your intentions sends them.

1643
00:57:59.753 --> 00:58:01.181
Well the ones between you and your boy

1644
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:04.798
are just more constant and a stronger focus

1645
00:58:04.798 --> 00:58:07.859
because you both stay focused on each other.

1646
00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:09.192
<v Voiceover>Yeah it's interesting.</v>

1647
00:58:09.192 --> 00:58:10.397
Sometimes we just laugh,

1648
00:58:10.397 --> 00:58:11.720
I can't believe you just said that.

1649
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.821
I just bought a new pair of shoes this morning too.

1650
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:15.378
You know? Or whatever.

1651
00:58:15.378 --> 00:58:19.740
Let's talk about larger realities and predictive,

1652
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:23.866
I guess you'd say tools.

1653
00:58:24.776 --> 00:58:26.760
Have you ever heard of Clif High?

1654
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.381
Do you know Clif High's work by any chance?

1655
00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:28.906
<v ->No.</v>

1656
00:58:28.906 --> 00:58:30.413
<v Voiceover>What Clif High does is</v>

1657
00:58:30.413 --> 00:58:32.321
he's done a lot of computer modeling

1658
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:33.954
and developed a lot of software in the past.

1659
00:58:33.954 --> 00:58:35.959
But what he found a long the way

1660
00:58:35.959 --> 00:58:38.709
and now has been doing for the last decade

1661
00:58:38.709 --> 00:58:42.271
is using mass global linguistics.

1662
00:58:42.271 --> 00:58:45.924
And his software will analyse, kind of,

1663
00:58:45.924 --> 00:58:48.206
spidering into forums around the world

1664
00:58:48.206 --> 00:58:51.620
or whatever the source is and start picking up

1665
00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:56.620
group key words in various languages

1666
00:58:57.752 --> 00:59:02.051
that start telling of what is rising from the group

1667
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:05.368
subconscious or unconscious as to future events.

1668
00:59:05.368 --> 00:59:08.631
And has been quite successful in being able to put

1669
00:59:08.631 --> 00:59:13.250
out there by way of predictions every few months

1670
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.354
what the future reality is likely to be.

1671
00:59:16.354 --> 00:59:17.570
And now you're getting into kind of

1672
00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:19.479
collective agreements,

1673
00:59:19.479 --> 00:59:21.751
collective resonance.

1674
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:25.164
We're getting into going beyond time and space.

1675
00:59:25.164 --> 00:59:26.999
What's actually happening there?

1676
00:59:26.999 --> 00:59:29.175
<v ->Well there's several things.</v>

1677
00:59:29.175 --> 00:59:31.222
And like most things in reality

1678
00:59:31.222 --> 00:59:32.897
there's always several ways that

1679
00:59:32.897 --> 00:59:34.443
something could happen, right?

1680
00:59:34.443 --> 00:59:36.534
It's very seldom so cut and dry that

1681
00:59:36.534 --> 00:59:38.539
this is the way that it always has to happen

1682
00:59:38.539 --> 00:59:40.118
and there couldn't be any other way.

1683
00:59:40.118 --> 00:59:41.974
One thing that could be going on there

1684
00:59:41.974 --> 00:59:45.368
is that it's not the data at all that he's getting.

1685
00:59:46.366 --> 00:59:49.342
That his collecting these words and tool,

1686
00:59:49.342 --> 00:59:51.123
and things that he has his computer do,

1687
00:59:51.123 --> 00:59:52.520
that's his tool.

1688
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.877
That's his tool for collecting information.

1689
00:59:54.877 --> 00:59:57.437
In fact, the information he's getting

1690
00:59:57.437 --> 01:00:00.466
is of his own creation from his own consciousness.

1691
01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:03.698
And this collection out in the, you know,

1692
01:00:03.698 --> 01:00:05.778
it's very uncertain what he collects out there, right?

1693
01:00:05.778 --> 01:00:07.922
There's a lot of uncertainty about

1694
01:00:07.922 --> 01:00:10.002
what word will surface and what wont.

1695
01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:12.220
Whenever you have uncertainty like that,

1696
01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.463
that can be manipulated by the system

1697
01:00:15.463 --> 01:00:16.758
as we were talking about.

1698
01:00:16.758 --> 01:00:19.457
So those words may be coming up for him.

1699
01:00:19.457 --> 01:00:21.601
Not that these people are producing

1700
01:00:21.601 --> 01:00:23.958
words that then he is getting.

1701
01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:25.929
So it's not necessarily that all those people

1702
01:00:25.929 --> 01:00:27.989
in all those forums and all those things

1703
01:00:27.989 --> 01:00:30.527
are generating future information.

1704
01:00:30.527 --> 01:00:34.442
This is just his system just like

1705
01:00:35.162 --> 01:00:38.148
you know, the planets are to--

1706
01:00:38.148 --> 01:00:39.545
<v Voiceover>Albeit very complex.</v>

1707
01:00:39.545 --> 01:00:42.445
<v ->Yeah it's very complex. Well so astrology, very complex.</v>

1708
01:00:42.445 --> 01:00:44.462
The more complex the better it works

1709
01:00:44.462 --> 01:00:45.901
because there's more uncertainty

1710
01:00:45.901 --> 01:00:47.245
and more room for interpretation.

1711
01:00:47.245 --> 01:00:48.803
You can't, you know, simple systems

1712
01:00:48.803 --> 01:00:50.744
like the little pendulum are just yes and no.

1713
01:00:50.744 --> 01:00:53.144
You don't get a lot there other than yes or no.

1714
01:00:53.144 --> 01:00:54.401
You have a complex system

1715
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:55.756
with a lot of uncertainty,

1716
01:00:55.756 --> 01:00:57.645
a lot of room for interpretation.

1717
01:00:57.645 --> 01:01:02.645
And it's, that can be manipulated to tell you things.

1718
01:01:02.771 --> 01:01:06.290
So he has an intent on the future, you know,

1719
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.008
what's gonna happen in the future.

1720
01:01:08.008 --> 01:01:09.735
What's gonna happen next week or next month

1721
01:01:09.735 --> 01:01:11.656
or what's gonna happen with this event.

1722
01:01:11.656 --> 01:01:14.097
That intention connects then

1723
01:01:14.097 --> 01:01:16.613
with the probable future database.

1724
01:01:16.613 --> 01:01:20.112
Now his tool for receiving that

1725
01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:21.562
isn't a picture,

1726
01:01:21.562 --> 01:01:23.548
isn't spoken word,

1727
01:01:23.548 --> 01:01:25.628
isn't a pendulum swinging,

1728
01:01:25.628 --> 01:01:27.688
you know, isn't the stars and stuff.

1729
01:01:27.688 --> 01:01:29.906
His thing is gathering all this data

1730
01:01:29.906 --> 01:01:31.229
from all these sources, whatever.

1731
01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:32.626
So my guess is that all that data

1732
01:01:32.626 --> 01:01:35.047
from all those sources are irrelevant.

1733
01:01:35.047 --> 01:01:36.902
It's in his mind.

1734
01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.003
If you had somebody else,

1735
01:01:39.003 --> 01:01:41.106
just take somebody, you know,

1736
01:01:41.106 --> 01:01:43.387
some random person and here's a program

1737
01:01:43.387 --> 01:01:45.787
go take this program and find out

1738
01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:47.611
what's gonna happen next week by

1739
01:01:47.611 --> 01:01:49.702
surfing the net on all the forums

1740
01:01:49.702 --> 01:01:51.708
and see what key words come up,

1741
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.670
it wouldn't work.
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

1742
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.110
<v ->It doesn't work because</v>

1743
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:58.252
the one active ingredient isn't there

1744
01:01:58.252 --> 01:02:00.738
which is this guy's mind. You see?

1745
01:02:00.738 --> 01:02:01.718
It's the same way.

1746
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.777
The computer makes a lousy astrologer

1747
01:02:03.777 --> 01:02:05.815
because what the active ingredient is

1748
01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:07.276
is the astrologers mind.

1749
01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:08.876
<v Voiceover>So you're saying by virtue</v>

1750
01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:11.596
of the model of our virtual reality,

1751
01:02:11.596 --> 01:02:14.837
it has to be so that it always has to come

1752
01:02:14.837 --> 01:02:16.470
no matter what the system is,

1753
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.371
no matter how accurate we may be using our tool,

1754
01:02:19.371 --> 01:02:21.208
that ultimately it's still being perceived

1755
01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:22.668
through our consciousness?

1756
01:02:22.668 --> 01:02:24.961
And that is the end of each story

1757
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:26.081
no matter who's story?

1758
01:02:26.081 --> 01:02:29.302
<v ->The only active ingredient is consciousness.</v>

1759
01:02:29.302 --> 01:02:32.928
Everything else is metaphor and tools.

1760
01:02:32.928 --> 01:02:35.703
We are consciousness that's what we are.

1761
01:02:35.703 --> 01:02:38.047
We are not, you know,

1762
01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:40.064
we are not a physical body

1763
01:02:40.064 --> 01:02:41.963
imagining that we have consciousness.

1764
01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:45.803
That's kind of the materialist reductions.

1765
01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:47.231
That's their point.

1766
01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:48.884
We are a consciousness imagining

1767
01:02:48.884 --> 01:02:51.104
that we have a physical body.

1768
01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:53.225
So we are fundamentally consciousness.

1769
01:02:53.225 --> 01:02:55.785
This is all just virtual, this physical stuff.

1770
01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:56.661
So we're consciousness,

1771
01:02:56.661 --> 01:02:57.928
you're consciousness, I'm consciousness

1772
01:02:57.928 --> 01:02:59.310
this guy's consciousness, we're all consciousness.

1773
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.943
And as consciousness we are

1774
01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.065
fundamentally communicating with each other.

1775
01:03:03.065 --> 01:03:05.508
And as we work in these databases,

1776
01:03:05.508 --> 01:03:06.628
which is our right to work in

1777
01:03:06.628 --> 01:03:07.748
because this is consciousness.

1778
01:03:07.748 --> 01:03:08.622
That's where the data is

1779
01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:09.966
and we're part of that system.

1780
01:03:09.966 --> 01:03:11.662
We gather this data.

1781
01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:13.806
We need to have a tool to do that

1782
01:03:13.806 --> 01:03:15.683
because we have beliefs.

1783
01:03:15.683 --> 01:03:17.390
And if we don't have tools to do it

1784
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:19.170
then we're lost.

1785
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.100
If I don't have the pendulum

1786
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.020
I can't tell whether an answer's yes or no.

1787
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.343
You see?

1788
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:25.130
<v Voiceover>We have to have our interface.</v>

1789
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.786
<v ->Some people's tool is just their intuition.</v>

1790
01:03:27.786 --> 01:03:28.970
They get the answer, yes or no.

1791
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.793
Some people hear it.

1792
01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:32.447
Some people have to swing pendulums.

1793
01:03:32.447 --> 01:03:34.708
Some people, you know, have to do stars and things.

1794
01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:36.511
Other people use Wigi boards.

1795
01:03:36.511 --> 01:03:38.729
You have all kinds of things that you can do.

1796
01:03:38.729 --> 01:03:41.012
They're all tools and they let you

1797
01:03:41.012 --> 01:03:44.489
focus your intent and collect the data.

1798
01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:46.750
So that would be my guess why he gets that.

1799
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:49.811
See, otherwise we get wrapped up around this thing.

1800
01:03:49.811 --> 01:03:51.006
How could that be?

1801
01:03:51.006 --> 01:03:52.467
How could all these things bubble up

1802
01:03:52.467 --> 01:03:54.152
out of whatever and make sense?

1803
01:03:54.152 --> 01:03:57.363
And we get lost in it because we believe

1804
01:03:57.363 --> 01:04:00.787
that we live in an objective reality.

1805
01:04:00.787 --> 01:04:02.088
We don't.

1806
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.570
We live in a statistical reality

1807
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.351
and we're consciousness.

1808
01:04:05.351 --> 01:04:07.389
And that's why that stuff works.

1809
01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:08.882
It's just tools.

1810
01:04:08.882 --> 01:04:10.038
<v Voiceover>Well, I don't know how Clifford would feel</v>

1811
01:04:10.038 --> 01:04:11.478
about hearing that information

1812
01:04:11.478 --> 01:04:13.163
because it certainly is, it's very empowering

1813
01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:15.659
on one level to say, and I know he has a dear friend

1814
01:04:15.659 --> 01:04:18.464
who has a lot of mystical qualities himself

1815
01:04:18.464 --> 01:04:20.320
who has suggested he's way more powerful

1816
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.144
than he gives himself credit for.

1817
01:04:22.144 --> 01:04:23.403
But we'll just leave it at that,

1818
01:04:23.403 --> 01:04:25.237
however Clifford wants to respond.

1819
01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:27.913
<v ->Well, you know, people make their tools sacred.</v>

1820
01:04:27.913 --> 01:04:29.438
Often the tools become sacred.

1821
01:04:29.438 --> 01:04:30.974
And you know, well, that's often

1822
01:04:30.974 --> 01:04:32.457
what religious worship about, you know?

1823
01:04:32.457 --> 01:04:34.995
It's the blaspheme of the scared tools.

1824
01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:37.804
And that's unfortunate

1825
01:04:37.804 --> 01:04:40.001
because then that turns into a belief,

1826
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:42.326
the belief turns in a trap and then

1827
01:04:42.326 --> 01:04:44.320
you're limited to that thing.

1828
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.963
If the only way you can interface

1829
01:04:45.963 --> 01:04:47.766
with the larger system is through this

1830
01:04:47.766 --> 01:04:49.824
very complex computer program

1831
01:04:49.824 --> 01:04:51.328
that's limiting.

1832
01:04:51.328 --> 01:04:52.288
You can pick simpler,

1833
01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:53.547
more effective tools

1834
01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:54.400
that suit you better.

1835
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.788
And you can get the same data in other ways.

1836
01:04:56.788 --> 01:04:58.208
So in a way, you know,

1837
01:04:58.208 --> 01:04:59.466
tools are wonderful.

1838
01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:01.066
Otherwise we don't have an interface.

1839
01:05:01.066 --> 01:05:03.199
We have these beliefs that we need to

1840
01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.340
have something happen in order to get the information.

1841
01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.759
We can't just get it.

1842
01:05:06.759 --> 01:05:08.540
You know, we need the pendulum.

1843
01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.660
We need the tool.

1844
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.556
We need the stars.

1845
01:05:10.556 --> 01:05:12.123
We need all this stuff

1846
01:05:12.123 --> 01:05:13.388
that justifies it to us

1847
01:05:13.388 --> 01:05:14.711
how we're doing it.

1848
01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.204
Because we have a belief

1849
01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:17.303
that you can't get anything

1850
01:05:17.303 --> 01:05:18.903
without something happening.

1851
01:05:18.903 --> 01:05:20.929
It doesn't have to happen that way.

1852
01:05:20.929 --> 01:05:22.049
We're consciousness.

1853
01:05:22.049 --> 01:05:22.988
It's just there.

1854
01:05:22.988 --> 01:05:23.766
We're a part of it.

1855
01:05:23.766 --> 01:05:24.630
We're all one.

1856
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.942
We're all sharing data.

1857
01:05:25.942 --> 01:05:28.267
You don't have to have the tool.

1858
01:05:28.267 --> 01:05:30.763
But most of us can't live without them

1859
01:05:30.763 --> 01:05:32.128
because that's our interface.

1860
01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.827
That's how we, that's the metaphor.

1861
01:05:34.827 --> 01:05:36.821
The tool is the metaphor we make

1862
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:39.968
for our connection to the larger reality.

1863
01:05:39.968 --> 01:05:41.962
So that's it and people will get upset.

1864
01:05:41.962 --> 01:05:43.850
You know, if you go to the reiki people

1865
01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:45.728
and you say, you know all those little symbols you do?

1866
01:05:45.728 --> 01:05:46.826
And you know, the touching of hands?

1867
01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:49.322
None of those are fundamental.

1868
01:05:49.322 --> 01:05:51.209
You don't need any of those symbols.

1869
01:05:51.209 --> 01:05:53.706
You can do all that without 'em.

1870
01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:56.020
The one's who really have gone past

1871
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.708
their belief system will agree with you.

1872
01:05:58.708 --> 01:05:59.988
Yeah I know.

1873
01:05:59.988 --> 01:06:02.281
But the others will get very upset

1874
01:06:02.281 --> 01:06:05.108
that you've just basically blasphemed

1875
01:06:05.108 --> 01:06:08.105
against their sacred tool set.

1876
01:06:08.105 --> 01:06:10.825
And it upsets them a whole lot.

1877
01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:12.745
You know, religious tools are the same way.

1878
01:06:12.745 --> 01:06:14.462
People don't like it if you

1879
01:06:14.462 --> 01:06:17.363
don't act respectful toward their cross

1880
01:06:17.363 --> 01:06:20.627
or their five pointed star or whatever else it is?

1881
01:06:20.627 --> 01:06:21.318
<v Voiceover>Well it's the downside</v>

1882
01:06:21.318 --> 01:06:22.964
of attachment in general.

1883
01:06:22.964 --> 01:06:24.585
But we can move beyond that.

1884
01:06:24.585 --> 01:06:25.972
And one thing that you were saying today

1885
01:06:25.972 --> 01:06:28.084
and I'll finish on this because literally

1886
01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.612
I could talk to you for many many hours.

1887
01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:32.628
There are so many other areas we could go into.

1888
01:06:32.628 --> 01:06:35.112
But I kind of, I like this one for an end point.

1889
01:06:35.112 --> 01:06:37.385
You were saying that the field of consciousness

1890
01:06:37.385 --> 01:06:40.531
is designed to help us succeed.

1891
01:06:40.531 --> 01:06:44.125
And that's really I think, a very potent

1892
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.747
point of understanding for all of us.

1893
01:06:45.747 --> 01:06:46.909
If you wouldn't mind just

1894
01:06:46.909 --> 01:06:48.509
explaining that a little bit more.

1895
01:06:48.509 --> 01:06:51.282
<v ->It is, as you say, designed to help us succeed.</v>

1896
01:06:51.282 --> 01:06:53.586
And by succeed I mean grow up.

1897
01:06:53.586 --> 01:06:55.122
Become love.

1898
01:06:55.122 --> 01:06:56.711
You know in my book I am a physicist

1899
01:06:56.711 --> 01:06:58.471
so I have technical descriptions, you know?

1900
01:06:58.471 --> 01:07:00.550
Reduce the entropy of your consciousness.

1901
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.684
What we're talking about is spiritual growth

1902
01:07:02.684 --> 01:07:04.562
is another word you could say that.

1903
01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.908
And why does it help us?

1904
01:07:06.908 --> 01:07:08.924
You know, it's not like the grandfatherly

1905
01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.025
you know, image that wants to

1906
01:07:10.025 --> 01:07:11.938
come around and help us pet people.

1907
01:07:11.938 --> 01:07:12.851
That's not it.

1908
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:16.109
Consciousness is an evolving system.

1909
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:18.532
The way that system evolves is to lower

1910
01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:21.945
its entropy to grow toward becoming love.

1911
01:07:21.945 --> 01:07:26.670
That's the side of growth, okay?

1912
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:29.828
De-evolving means falling apart.

1913
01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:31.342
Coming unglued.

1914
01:07:31.342 --> 01:07:33.145
Becoming nothing, right?

1915
01:07:33.145 --> 01:07:35.267
And the things that are devisive

1916
01:07:35.267 --> 01:07:36.770
that tear us apart are things like

1917
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.830
ego, fear, you know,

1918
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.750
all these things are high entropy things.

1919
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.370
Love pulls us together.

1920
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:43.499
It's a unifying.

1921
01:07:43.499 --> 01:07:46.465
It's a building structure.

1922
01:07:46.465 --> 01:07:47.979
Not tearing things apart.

1923
01:07:47.979 --> 01:07:49.920
So that's what the consciousness system is doing.

1924
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.843
It's just a system, a natural system.

1925
01:07:52.843 --> 01:07:55.616
Just like the environment is a system on this planet.

1926
01:07:55.616 --> 01:07:57.963
Just like the solar system is just a system

1927
01:07:57.963 --> 01:07:59.360
that does what it does.

1928
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.324
The consciousness system is a natural system.

1929
01:08:02.324 --> 01:08:04.757
It's evolving toward love.

1930
01:08:04.757 --> 01:08:07.317
We are part of that evolution.

1931
01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:08.895
We're part of that evolution cycle.

1932
01:08:08.895 --> 01:08:10.964
That's part of how it evolves is through us.

1933
01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:12.884
We are consciousness.

1934
01:08:12.884 --> 01:08:14.762
Part of the way it evolves is

1935
01:08:14.762 --> 01:08:17.270
put little pieces of itself like us

1936
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:18.923
to interact with each other.

1937
01:08:18.923 --> 01:08:21.568
So that we can exercise freewill,

1938
01:08:21.568 --> 01:08:23.467
our intent, make good decisions,

1939
01:08:23.467 --> 01:08:25.109
and grow our being.

1940
01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:26.229
That's what we're here for.

1941
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:27.627
That's our purpose.

1942
01:08:27.627 --> 01:08:29.429
So why would it not help us?

1943
01:08:29.429 --> 01:08:31.370
We are it, it is us.

1944
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.402
We are part of that evolution that it needs

1945
01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:37.940
to not dissolve and turn into nothing.

1946
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.574
So yes it helps us.

1947
01:08:39.574 --> 01:08:41.771
It sets up this physical reality,

1948
01:08:41.771 --> 01:08:43.841
our universe as a learning lab

1949
01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:46.295
for us to learn in.

1950
01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:48.119
That's trying to help us.

1951
01:08:48.119 --> 01:08:50.220
And now here we are in this learning lab

1952
01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.343
and sometimes we're a little thick-headed

1953
01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:53.836
and we just don't get it.

1954
01:08:53.836 --> 01:08:55.276
It'll nudge us.

1955
01:08:55.276 --> 01:08:56.737
How does it nudge us?

1956
01:08:56.737 --> 01:08:58.742
I had an engineer who thought

1957
01:08:58.742 --> 01:09:00.939
all of this was just so much bologna.

1958
01:09:00.939 --> 01:09:03.414
Until one night he had a dream

1959
01:09:03.414 --> 01:09:07.062
and he saw that he was in an airplane.

1960
01:09:07.062 --> 01:09:09.920
And in this airplane everyone was in

1961
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.840
black and white except one little girl.

1962
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.933
And one little girl about six years old was in color.

1963
01:09:14.933 --> 01:09:16.213
He knew about planes.

1964
01:09:16.213 --> 01:09:17.802
He knew exactly what kind of plane it was.

1965
01:09:17.802 --> 01:09:20.277
The manufacturer, you know, and that sort of thing.

1966
01:09:20.277 --> 01:09:22.773
That was part of his engineering.

1967
01:09:22.773 --> 01:09:24.341
So he knew those kinds of things.

1968
01:09:24.341 --> 01:09:28.152
Well, the very next day a plane crashed.

1969
01:09:28.152 --> 01:09:30.605
Everyone was killed but one little girl.

1970
01:09:30.605 --> 01:09:32.674
And he looked at the passenger list

1971
01:09:32.674 --> 01:09:34.674
and the number of people and the plane that it was.

1972
01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:37.911
It was the same plane with the same count of people on it.

1973
01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:40.332
And he said he could see everyone one of those people.

1974
01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:42.348
You know, they were in black and white but he saw

1975
01:09:42.348 --> 01:09:44.812
if they had wrinkles he saw their wrinkles.

1976
01:09:44.812 --> 01:09:47.585
This was in detail, you know, just like being there.

1977
01:09:47.585 --> 01:09:49.585
And it hit him like a ton of bricks.

1978
01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.633
Now why did that happen to him?

1979
01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:54.406
That's a nudge from the larger consciousness system.

1980
01:09:54.406 --> 01:09:55.813
That opened his mind.

1981
01:09:55.813 --> 01:09:59.152
Suddenly he could not explain that away.

1982
01:09:59.152 --> 01:10:02.704
And he had a bigger reality than it had the day before.

1983
01:10:02.704 --> 01:10:04.709
That's just a, you know,

1984
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:06.949
a wedge in the door to open it up.

1985
01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:08.666
A lot of our things from simple things

1986
01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:11.663
to deja vu, to synchronicity,

1987
01:10:11.663 --> 01:10:15.343
to these precognitive dreams like that,

1988
01:10:15.343 --> 01:10:17.647
telepathy, you know, like yourself,

1989
01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.450
you and your son, you know?

1990
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.807
All of these experiences that aren't exactly

1991
01:10:21.807 --> 01:10:25.571
normal are things to open up our doors.

1992
01:10:25.571 --> 01:10:26.671
It's to let us know,

1993
01:10:26.671 --> 01:10:29.806
hey, the reality's bigger than you think.

1994
01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:31.470
Otherwise how could you do this?

1995
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:33.806
How could you know that that plane was gonna crash

1996
01:10:33.806 --> 01:10:34.926
and the people who'd be on it

1997
01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:36.345
and who wouldn't survive?

1998
01:10:36.345 --> 01:10:37.369
How cold you know that?

1999
01:10:37.369 --> 01:10:38.530
Because he had that dream

2000
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:41.070
a day or two before the plane crashed.

2001
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.690
Before those people ever got on the plane.

2002
01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:44.909
Probably before some of them ever bought their tickets.

2003
01:10:44.909 --> 01:10:46.467
You know, how did you know that?

2004
01:10:46.467 --> 01:10:49.165
So suddenly his reality was thrown open.

2005
01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:50.541
Well when people have that happen

2006
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:52.248
they start searching for answers.

2007
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.762
They start reading things.

2008
01:10:53.762 --> 01:10:55.341
You know, they start looking at the literature.

2009
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:57.101
They start going to the web.

2010
01:10:57.101 --> 01:10:59.213
So this is an opening thing.

2011
01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:02.850
So those kinds of things are done to wake us up.

2012
01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.386
You know? It's a wake up call.

2013
01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:07.607
It's a nudge to grow up.

2014
01:11:07.607 --> 01:11:08.908
To look at the bigger reality.

2015
01:11:08.908 --> 01:11:11.852
To see something beside your job and the TV.

2016
01:11:11.852 --> 01:11:13.494
You know, and keeping up with the neighbors

2017
01:11:13.494 --> 01:11:15.350
and those kinds of things that occupy us.

2018
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:18.113
So that's why the system goes through that trouble

2019
01:11:18.113 --> 01:11:22.486
to help us evolve because we are part of it's evolution.

2020
01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:25.466
It evolves as it evolves, we evolve as it evolves.

2021
01:11:25.553 --> 01:11:27.814
So of course it would help us.

2022
01:11:27.814 --> 01:11:30.747
And it has lost of wiggle room

2023
01:11:30.747 --> 01:11:34.373
in the uncertainty around our rule set

2024
01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:37.594
and around our history that it can operate in.

2025
01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:38.581
And it does.

2026
01:11:38.581 --> 01:11:41.460
<v Voiceover>And we use that for our own creation.</v>

2027
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.754
<v ->We use that for our creation, exactly.</v>

2028
01:11:43.754 --> 01:11:45.375
We are consciousness.

2029
01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:46.751
And consciousness is us.

2030
01:11:46.751 --> 01:11:48.575
You see? So we're all apart of this thing.

2031
01:11:48.575 --> 01:11:50.100
We can create too.

2032
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.212
It's not just that this larger consciousness creates

2033
01:11:52.212 --> 01:11:54.420
and we just sit here and go through the,

2034
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.711
you know, interact with it.

2035
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.939
But we also can create and modify things

2036
01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.379
and change those probabilities.

2037
01:11:59.379 --> 01:12:01.758
We can nudge others as well.

2038
01:12:01.758 --> 01:12:05.299
It's just a matter of understanding how it all works.

2039
01:12:05.299 --> 01:12:08.339
And then learning how to access it,

2040
01:12:08.339 --> 01:12:10.494
how to control it and how to use it.

2041
01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:13.576
<v Voiceover>Well, I think that pretty much says it all.</v>

2042
01:12:13.576 --> 01:12:15.550
Well it doesn't say it all as I said.

2043
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:17.192
There's a lot more.

2044
01:12:17.192 --> 01:12:19.272
So anybody wanting to know more about it

2045
01:12:19.272 --> 01:12:22.856
can go to your site and take a look at some of the

2046
01:12:22.856 --> 01:12:24.573
conferences you have coming up

2047
01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.696
and also purchase some of the books.

2048
01:12:26.696 --> 01:12:28.413
Start going on their own.

2049
01:12:29.633 --> 01:12:30.962
You've been lecturing all day.

2050
01:12:30.962 --> 01:12:32.423
I really appreciate your taking the time

2051
01:12:32.423 --> 01:12:34.940
after all of that to speak with us.

2052
01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.082
It's been a long day for you.

2053
01:12:36.082 --> 01:12:37.126
<v ->You're very welcome.</v>

2054
01:12:37.126 --> 01:12:38.246
My pleasure.

2055
01:12:38.246 --> 01:12:40.107
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

2056
01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:42.481
<v ->To explore Tom's work further</v>

2057
01:12:42.481 --> 01:12:43.943
you can attend one of his workshops

2058
01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:45.958
on remote viewing or pick up a copy

2059
01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:47.377
of My Big Toe.

If this kind of information is powerful for you

2065
01:12:57.611 --> 01:12:59.296
you might also enjoy our interviews with

2066

Amit Goswami and Dean Radin.

2067
01:13:01.056 --> 01:13:01.931
Until next time.

2068
01:13:01.931 --> 01:13:04.324
Thanks for watching CMN.
