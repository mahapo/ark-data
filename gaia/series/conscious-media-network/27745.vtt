00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:03.064
<v ->Perhaps one of the saddest stories</v>

2
00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:05.527
surrounding the invention of new healing technologies

3
00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:07.956
is one that dates back about 70 years,

4
00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:10.244
the story of Royal Raymond Rife.

5
00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.697
Rife invented a microscope, the likes of which

6
00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:14.398
the world had never seen,

7
00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:17.765
enabling Rife to define the frequency of living viruses,

8
00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:20.815
bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens.

9
00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:24.699
Once identified, an electrical frequency could kill them.

10
00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.832
So powerful is this technology that the doctors affiliated

11
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.777
with Rife declared an end to cancer and disease

12
00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:32.631
back in the 1930s.

13
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.001
What happened from there is a shameful blight

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.442
on the progress of medicine and healing.

15
00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.870
Steven Ross, founder of the World Research Foundation,

16
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.794
is a major link in this story,

17
00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:45.709
as he was given the number 3 Rife Universal Microscope

18
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:48.119
by Rife's colleague in 1984.

19
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:49.974
Along with the microscope came stacks

20
00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:54.029
of original correspondence between Rife and his colleagues.

21
00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:57.597 line:15% 
(soothing music)

22
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.946
The Rife microscope has been enshrouded

23
00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:04.993
in not only a lot of mystery

24
00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:08.213
but a lot of disinformation and misinformation

25
00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:09.621
through the years.

26
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.590
And the reason we're talking is that back in,

27
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.262
I believe it was the early to mid 1980s

28
00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:18.826
through a bizarre series of events,

29
00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:21.222
it showed up in your life.

30
00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:24.261
Can you share with us what happened?

31
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:27.921
As I recall, weren't you in the Bodhi Tree Bookstore

32
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.046
in Los Angeles,

33
00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:30.290
isn't that where the journey began?

34
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.705
<v ->Exactly, you have a wonderful memory.</v>

35
00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:36.038
I actually at first heard about the Rife microscope

36
00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:38.236
because I had been searching for a book

37
00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.171
that was out of print that was called

38
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:42.692
New Light on Therapeutic Energies

39
00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:44.680
by Mark Gallert.

40
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:46.785
I had searched for many years and then one day

41
00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.533
I was in the Bodhi Tree Bookstore

42
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.760
in Los Angeles, California,

43
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.769
happened to reach behind a shelf of books and found

44
00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:56.827
the book wedged back there,

45
00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:59.141
and lo and behold it was that book.

46
00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:01.881
And I was so excited because I'd been looking for it

47
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:03.609
actually not about Rife,

48
00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.225
but information about Dinshah Ghadiali,

49
00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:10.026
who was a color practitioner

50
00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:12.160
back in the early 1900s.

51
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.021
Read about the Rife microscope in this book

52
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.677
and was so intrigued I called a medical doctor

53
00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:22.421
friend of mine, Dr. Harry Lusk in Los Angeles,

54
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:24.776
and asked him if he had ever heard about this

55
00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:26.386
super microscope.

56
00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.211
He mentioned that he had,

57
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:31.826
and I was so excited trying to get information from Harry.

58
00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:34.973
And he had told me that many years earlier,

59
00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:38.695
probably 20 years before our conversation,

60
00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:43.143
he had met a man who said that he had this Rife microscope

61
00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:45.492
and his name was John Crane.

62
00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:49.627
I asked Harry, could you please share his phone number,

63
00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.934
can I get in touch?

64
00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:53.636
And Harry said to me, "Steve,

65
00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:55.753
I tried to get in touch with this man,

66
00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:58.321
the phone numbers never worked,

67
00:02:58.421 --> 00:02:59.873
I'm not sure."

68
00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:02.094
I said, Harry, do you have that number?

69
00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:05.753
And he said, "Steve, I have no idea where it is."

70
00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:09.523
The next morning I get a call and Harry was stuttering,

71
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.133
he was going, "S-S-Steve,"

72
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:13.923
And I go, Harry, what's up?

73
00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:17.065
He goes, "I stepped out of my bed

74
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:20.128
and there was a piece of paper on the floor,

75
00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:22.751
and it had the phone number of this man."

76
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.008
Now I know this sounds a little bizarre

77
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:28.866
but we're sharing this story how it came about.

78
00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:31.539
I said, well Harry, maybe it was there all the time.

79
00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.405
And he goes, "Steve,

80
00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:35.739
it was not there all the time."

81
00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:38.945
He gave me the number, I was able to reach John Crane

82
00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:42.955
of San Diego who for one hour continually

83
00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.163
bombarded me with questions.

84
00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:48.086
Who am I, am I with the FDA and the MA,

85
00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:51.354
and eventually he invited me to visit him.

86
00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:54.724
We set the appointment up for two days later,

87
00:03:54.724 --> 00:03:56.720
and I told Harry,

88
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.512
Harry was supposed to go with me.

89
00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:01.547
Two days later, as we're about to leave,

90
00:04:01.547 --> 00:04:05.421
Harry who was a gynecologist

91
00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:06.961
and a medical doctor,

92
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:08.643
had a delivery to make.

93
00:04:08.643 --> 00:04:12.077
I had to cancel my meeting with John.

94
00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.825
We rescheduled two days after that,

95
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.944
we were about to leave LA, Harry made another delivery,

96
00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:21.784
and I said, Harry, I'm going by myself to San Diego.

97
00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:22.946
I went down there,

98
00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:24.481
met John Crane,

99
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.713
and after about four months of sharing,

100
00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:29.524
he gave me

101
00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:33.534
the Rife Universal Microscope.

102
00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:34.478
<v ->The?</v>

103
00:04:34.478 --> 00:04:38.380
<v ->The one and only Universal.</v>

104
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.468
Now many people have spoken about

105
00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:44.603
the microscopes and yes he made five different models

106
00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:46.764
but there was only one

107
00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:50.404
number 3 Universal Microscope.

108
00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:53.530
Regina, over the years I have had so many people

109
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.799
cross my paths,

110
00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:57.761
especially during the time I had the microscope,

111
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.056
telling me they had the Rife microscope,

112
00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:04.010
and they had original frequency devices.

113
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.849
Which obviously was nonsense because at that time,

114
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.031
which was from the middle of 1984

115
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:16.905
through the beginning of 1987 we had that microscope.

116
00:05:18.474 --> 00:05:21.348
<v ->Can you give us some linage as to how Crane ended up</v>

117
00:05:21.348 --> 00:05:22.447
with the microscope?

118
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:26.009
Who Crane was in his life, for anybody who hasn't read

119
00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.345
in any great detail about Royal Rife's life

120
00:05:28.345 --> 00:05:31.690
and what occurred there?

121
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.675
<v ->The history of the microscope goes back</v>

122
00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:38.025
into the mid 1920s,

123
00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.669
actually a little bit earlier than that,

124
00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.424
where Rife was working as a chauffeur for a man named

125
00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:46.772
Timkens in San Diego.

126
00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:49.406
We'll skip a little bit ahead and just say that

127
00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:51.028
towards the end of Rife's life,

128
00:05:51.028 --> 00:05:54.580
he had been abandoned by most of the medical doctors

129
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.933
who worked with him out of fear and threats

130
00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:01.002
that was coming from various corridors.

131
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:04.319
Because there was an element that did not want

132
00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.668
the technology that went along with the microscope

133
00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:11.150
to come out in the medical arena.

134
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.122
<v ->Because it was supplanting the use of drugs</v>

135
00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:15.412
and antibiotics had just come on to the scene.

136
00:06:15.412 --> 00:06:17.816
<v ->Exactly and I'm very familiar with this because</v>

137
00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:20.311
along with the microscope, I had received

138
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:23.853
500 personal letters of all of the medical doctors,

139
00:06:23.853 --> 00:06:25.228
all their lab notes,

140
00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:28.803
all of their correspondences.

141
00:06:28.803 --> 00:06:32.036
So we're very, very familiar with the story of Rife

142
00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:33.435
and what was going on

143
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:37.948
including where the pressure was coming from

144
00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:39.499
against the work that they were doing.

145
00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.694
<v ->Are you at liberty to say?</v>

146
00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:42.326
<v ->Oh, absolutely, it was coming again</v>

147
00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:46.217
from the pharmaceutical interest,

148
00:06:46.217 --> 00:06:49.067
it from coming at the time from

149
00:06:49.336 --> 00:06:52.280
pharmaceutical families or families who have

150
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.839
very strong pharmaceutical interests.

151
00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.485
A lot of pressure also came from the AMA,

152
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:00.492
who wanted a piece of the action of the microscope,

153
00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:02.263
which was really silly.

154
00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:05.484
Dr. Morris Fishbein who was the head of the AMA,

155
00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:08.438
approached Rife and we have the materials

156
00:07:08.438 --> 00:07:11.745
saying that he wanted a piece of the action

157
00:07:11.745 --> 00:07:14.082
of sales of microscopes.

158
00:07:14.082 --> 00:07:16.867
And of course Rife and his team at the time answered,

159
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:18.207
that was just ridiculous.

160
00:07:18.207 --> 00:07:20.510
<v ->That's blackmail, really.
<v ->It is blackmail.</v>

161
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.308
I have several letters directly,

162
00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:25.387
especially from various journals,

163
00:07:25.387 --> 00:07:28.736
that mention why they did not find an account of this

164
00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:31.642
microscope in the AMA journal.

165
00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:35.784
And basically Fishbein blackballed any of the doctors

166
00:07:35.784 --> 00:07:40.223
working with Rife and really put a lid on the information

167
00:07:40.223 --> 00:07:44.231
that came out in the medical journals.

168
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.012
Sufficive to say,

169
00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:49.142
as lot of medical people abandoned Rife,

170
00:07:49.142 --> 00:07:51.775
he spent the last part of his life really, alone,

171
00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:54.443
became a drunk.

172
00:07:54.443 --> 00:07:56.554
And eventually,

173
00:07:56.554 --> 00:07:58.984
I'd say within the last five years of his life

174
00:07:58.984 --> 00:08:03.389
was selling a drafting set to get money.

175
00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:05.929
Where he was selling this drafting set,

176
00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:09.609
John Crane happened to walk in to this facility

177
00:08:09.609 --> 00:08:11.090
in San Diego,

178
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.224
heard the story from this man,

179
00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:14.876
befriended him,

180
00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:17.040
and Rife ended up giving

181
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.210
all of the materials of Rife's work

182
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.195
to John Crane of San Diego.

183
00:08:22.195 --> 00:08:23.510
<v ->Why did he trust Crane?</v>

184
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.002
And I wanna go back and talk about the infamous picture

185
00:08:26.002 --> 00:08:28.839
and what was happening in the world of medicine,

186
00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:30.792
with Rife's work in its prime.

187
00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:34.955
But before we go back there, why Crane?

188
00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:38.462
<v ->Crane was at the right place at the right time.</v>

189
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:40.262
Rife needed the money,

190
00:08:40.262 --> 00:08:41.988
here comes John Crane,

191
00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.933
who had an engineering background, not in microscopy,

192
00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:48.110
but had an engineering background.

193
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.873
And the two of 'em happened to hit it off.

194
00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:54.286
Now I spent quite a lot of time with John,

195
00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:56.983
and I would just say that I could see John,

196
00:08:56.983 --> 00:08:58.755
to me, I'm gonna use it in a loving way,

197
00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:00.934
was an old codger.

198
00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:05.730
In fact when I visited his house, he was such a recluse,

199
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.500
all the windows were boarded shut

200
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.531
and there was hardly any light inside,

201
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:13.750
he really hadn't cleaned his house,

202
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.501
there were papers everywhere.

203
00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:19.562
It was just very unkempt.

204
00:09:19.562 --> 00:09:21.540
But he seemed to function

205
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.704
in that particular atmosphere,

206
00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:28.225
possibly because he had also been thrown in jail for about

207
00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:29.194
three years.

208
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.610
<v ->I wanted to ask you about that,</v>

209
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.315
hadn't his office broken into?

210
00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:39.014
And hadn't he also had some violent encounters?

211
00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:41.978
Can you explain what happened to him as a result

212
00:09:41.978 --> 00:09:43.545
of having this,

213
00:09:43.545 --> 00:09:44.847
some would say an albatross,

214
00:09:44.847 --> 00:09:46.831
some would say one of the greatest gifts to the planet.

215
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:47.993
<v ->Right.</v>

216
00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:52.124
I believe the history of people associated with Rife

217
00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.703
can be summed up in this manner.

218
00:09:55.457 --> 00:09:59.973
There was articles written about that Rife microscope

219
00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:03.910
again in even the 1940s.

220
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.923
In 1964, an article was written called

221
00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:10.891
The Rife Microscope, Facts and Their Fate,

222
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:12.640
by Dr. Royal Lee

223
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.129
of the Lee Foundation for Nutrition and Health.

224
00:10:16.129 --> 00:10:19.483
He reprinted the article that appeared in the Smithsonian

225
00:10:19.483 --> 00:10:21.850
in 1984,

226
00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:27.114
and that article, as soon as it came out,

227
00:10:27.114 --> 00:10:29.855
Royal Lee who was involved in the health field

228
00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.944
ended up dying very mysteriously.

229
00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:35.735
It was very unique because from the report that

230
00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.837
I had received,

231
00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:40.672
he had Strontium-90 completely in his body.

232
00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:42.988
And the story that I had heard was

233
00:10:42.988 --> 00:10:46.710
that the desk chair that he had sat in

234
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.744
was tainted and so he absorbed this every day

235
00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:51.040
that he went in there.

236
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.812
My point is, is that--

237
00:10:52.812 --> 00:10:54.987
<v ->Bad things happen to people who are involved</v>

238
00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.320
with this microscope.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

239
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.780
And I believe bad things continued to happen

240
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.142
for even the modern era people.

241
00:11:02.526 --> 00:11:06.351
<v ->Okay, before we go there, 'cause that's a fabulous story.</v>

242
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:07.496
John Crane has it,

243
00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:10.275
he started encountering a lot of problems.

244
00:11:10.275 --> 00:11:12.823
Let's just get up to how you got the microscope

245
00:11:12.823 --> 00:11:14.951
and then we'll go back into the history of

246
00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:16.760
what it was able to do.

247
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.505
<v ->After about four months of visiting with John</v>

248
00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:23.985
and speaking, and I think he was really checking us out

249
00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:28.159
and seeing who we were and what we intended to do.

250
00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:32.217
I told him that I was forming a worldwide health foundation

251
00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:35.397
and that we were going to have this and protect

252
00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:36.720
this microscope.

253
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.216
And then one day he calls me up,

254
00:11:39.216 --> 00:11:41.516
at that particular time I went down there

255
00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:43.447
with my ex-wife LaVerne,

256
00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:47.515
and he mentioned to bring the station wagon the next time

257
00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:49.636
I drove to San Diego, and I thought,

258
00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:50.980
this is pretty strange.

259
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.745
But I went down with the station wagon.

260
00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:57.968
As soon as I met him, and again this was in 1984,

261
00:11:57.968 --> 00:12:02.392
he says, "I want you to take the Rife microscope."

262
00:12:02.914 --> 00:12:06.200
And I was so overwhelmed, it was like, okay.

263
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.735
(both chuckling)

264
00:12:07.735 --> 00:12:10.189
I signed an agreement with him.

265
00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:13.518
Basically you had a piece of paper that said

266
00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:16.952
if I was able to get it fully functional

267
00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:19.085
within a two year period,

268
00:12:19.085 --> 00:12:23.152
that I would have a partnership,

269
00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:25.012
ownership with him.

270
00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:28.506
Well in retrospect, if I had been a little bit cleverer

271
00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.262
and jumped on that,

272
00:12:30.262 --> 00:12:31.708
perhaps the history of the microscope

273
00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:33.467
would be a little bit different.

274
00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:36.260
But we really didn't do that.

275
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.874
We were just so overwhelmed

276
00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:40.741
to have this piece of history

277
00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:44.016
and all the additional materials that came with it.

278
00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:46.331
So here we have this Rife microscope,

279
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.422
we brought it back from San Diego

280
00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:50.704
to Los Angeles, California,

281
00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:52.682
and immediately

282
00:12:52.682 --> 00:12:55.462
the prestige of our organization

283
00:12:55.462 --> 00:12:58.737
blossomed because people heard

284
00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:00.359
we had the Rife microscope.

285
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:02.129
In fact Regina,

286
00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.266
some side stories,

287
00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:08.694
I gave a lecture over at the A.R.E. conference in Phoenix

288
00:13:08.694 --> 00:13:11.406
about early 1986,

289
00:13:11.406 --> 00:13:15.606
and was approached by two men who I had never met before.

290
00:13:15.606 --> 00:13:18.414
And I'll mention their names, they came up to me,

291
00:13:18.414 --> 00:13:20.857
and they immediately looked at me and go,

292
00:13:20.857 --> 00:13:22.650
"Who are you?

293
00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:25.732
Why do you have the Rife microscope?"

294
00:13:25.732 --> 00:13:27.669
One of 'em was Christopher Bird

295
00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:30.613
who wrote a book called The Secret Life of Plants.

296
00:13:30.613 --> 00:13:33.951
And he had been seeking and looking for this microscope

297
00:13:33.951 --> 00:13:35.754
for a very long time.

298
00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:37.578
But I'd left out a little part

299
00:13:37.578 --> 00:13:39.334
because they used a little bit of swear words.

300
00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:41.252
It was like, "Who the, are you?"

301
00:13:41.252 --> 00:13:42.192
(laughing)

302
00:13:42.192 --> 00:13:44.330
and, "Why would you have that?"

303
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.912
Another fellow who approached me was

304
00:13:47.912 --> 00:13:51.055
a fellow from Noetic Sciences.

305
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:54.058
He basically came up to me and said the same thing.

306
00:13:54.058 --> 00:13:55.945
"We're with Edgar Mitchell's group,

307
00:13:55.945 --> 00:13:59.737
and we're this big thing and you're a puny organization,

308
00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:03.305
and we should have the Rife microscope and you shouldn't."

309
00:14:03.305 --> 00:14:05.908
So I met a lot of people

310
00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:10.398
who were very belligerent and couldn't understand

311
00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:11.987
why we had it.

312
00:14:11.987 --> 00:14:15.945
What I will share is, I didn't pay any money for it.

313
00:14:15.945 --> 00:14:18.197
We had no coercion.

314
00:14:18.197 --> 00:14:21.233
John Crane entrusted it to us

315
00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:23.762
during the time that we had it.

316
00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:27.776
We utilized that in a way that I think,

317
00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:30.316
protecting it, caretaking it,

318
00:14:30.316 --> 00:14:33.814
with a plan that we were going to put into action

319
00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:37.716
until literally the microscope was taken away from us.

320
00:14:37.716 --> 00:14:39.172
in 1987.

321
00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:40.885
<v ->What happened?</v>

322
00:14:40.885 --> 00:14:44.262
<v ->I did a three hour radio program</v>

323
00:14:44.262 --> 00:14:46.292
on KABC Radio

324
00:14:46.292 --> 00:14:49.738
in Los Angeles, it's a 50,000 watt station,

325
00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:52.723
and I was originally supposed to do a one hour show

326
00:14:52.723 --> 00:14:54.515
with Bill Jenkins.

327
00:14:54.515 --> 00:14:57.384
The response was so overwhelming that he kept asking me

328
00:14:57.384 --> 00:14:59.346
to stay longer.

329
00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:03.676
After the third hour, we went from nine till 12 midnight,

330
00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:06.947
that switchboard was just solidly lit up.

331
00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:11.423
I actually stayed an extra hour answering calls off the air.

332
00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:13.331
Two months after that,

333
00:15:13.331 --> 00:15:17.533
three men approached me with John Crane propped up

334
00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:19.240
between them,

335
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.357
saying that John wanted his microscope back.

336
00:15:23.613 --> 00:15:25.349
<v ->Who were these guys?</v>

337
00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:29.449
<v ->Two of 'em were attorneys who flashed their cards down</v>

338
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:32.066
and kept looking over John.

339
00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:35.095
John absolutely did not say a word.

340
00:15:35.095 --> 00:15:37.469
He did not seem coherent to me.

341
00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:40.328
They said John had an agreement with you,

342
00:15:40.328 --> 00:15:43.016
he wants his microscope back right now.

343
00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:46.708
And my agreement basically with him,

344
00:15:46.708 --> 00:15:48.658
or my philosophy of his life is,

345
00:15:48.658 --> 00:15:51.435
he entrusted it with me at the time,

346
00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:53.077
it was his property,

347
00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.698
and we returned it.

348
00:15:54.698 --> 00:15:58.335
I will share with you that this group of which they have

349
00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:01.482
set up a foundation in San Diego and others,

350
00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:05.288
had so much infighting, fighting over that microscope,

351
00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:07.218
taking pieces of it,

352
00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:10.790
that I lost touch with it at that time

353
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.177
because these people were like piranhas.

354
00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:14.777
Absolute piranhas.

355
00:16:14.777 --> 00:16:16.991
We had had a game plan

356
00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:21.017
with our organization to eventually get this microscope

357
00:16:21.017 --> 00:16:23.736
back out to the public

358
00:16:23.736 --> 00:16:26.531
in a way where it could be validated

359
00:16:26.531 --> 00:16:30.911
and have a lot of good energy behind it.

360
00:16:30.911 --> 00:16:33.368
I'm using the word good because

361
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.937
as nice a person as John Crane was,

362
00:16:35.937 --> 00:16:37.708
John was crazy.

363
00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:40.220
John had been thrown in jail

364
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.489
for selling unapproved health devices.

365
00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:49.017
He had million dollar lawsuits against 50 people

366
00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:51.877
in all stratas of government.

367
00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:55.568
He was not a stable individual.

368
00:16:55.568 --> 00:16:58.906
And my fear was that somebody like this

369
00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:01.316
presenting the microscope

370
00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:03.577
makes it very, very difficult because

371
00:17:03.577 --> 00:17:06.689
he would be torn down in his personality

372
00:17:06.689 --> 00:17:09.993
and the microscope would not get

373
00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:12.053
its fair day in the sun.

374
00:17:12.053 --> 00:17:13.669
Which brings up a interesting point

375
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:16.700
that I'm very happy to be doing this with you

376
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.155
because I have turned down many opportunities to speak,

377
00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:24.941
because a lot of the other stations or people

378
00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:28.846
were combining this with UFOs

379
00:17:28.846 --> 00:17:31.866
and all kinds of bizarre stories.

380
00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:33.847
I like those kind of stories,

381
00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:36.518
but I do not believe that they should be associated

382
00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:40.273
with something as scientific and as strong

383
00:17:40.273 --> 00:17:42.933
as this particular story is.

384
00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:46.591
And so I've refused to do a lot of the stories,

385
00:17:46.591 --> 00:17:49.864
and I believe that we have as much if not more

386
00:17:49.864 --> 00:17:51.732
than anybody else on this planet

387
00:17:51.732 --> 00:17:54.966
having to do with the microscope,

388
00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.450
the back up information.

389
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.487
People have little bits and pieces,

390
00:17:58.487 --> 00:18:02.019
but at one time we had probably the majority

391
00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:04.216
of what was extant at the time.

392
00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:06.306
<v ->And you still have a fair amount.</v>

393
00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:08.103
<v ->We do.
<v ->Yes.</v>

394
00:18:08.103 --> 00:18:11.531
I've seen bits and pieces, some of the personal letters

395
00:18:11.531 --> 00:18:13.154
and such, from the day,

396
00:18:13.154 --> 00:18:15.224
written by the doctors that were involved.

397
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:17.945
So let's go back to the glory days,

398
00:18:17.945 --> 00:18:20.325
before they ruined him.

399
00:18:20.643 --> 00:18:24.119
He had a couple of doctors that came on board,

400
00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:25.824
very enthusiastic.

401
00:18:25.824 --> 00:18:29.216
He had taken, my understanding, it was up to 30 years

402
00:18:29.216 --> 00:18:31.492
to really get the protocols pat,

403
00:18:31.492 --> 00:18:35.569
in terms of the frequencies and diseases and so forth.

404
00:18:36.011 --> 00:18:38.446
Can you tell us about a couple of the doctors that came on

405
00:18:38.446 --> 00:18:41.133
that were really key players in some of the results

406
00:18:41.133 --> 00:18:42.575
they were getting?

407
00:18:42.575 --> 00:18:46.190
<v ->The strongest ally he had was Milbank Johnson.</v>

408
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.592
Milbank Johnson was the local head of the AMA

409
00:18:49.592 --> 00:18:52.217
out of Pasadena, California.

410
00:18:52.217 --> 00:18:54.316
Milbank Johnson was a millionaire,

411
00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:57.216
also started an incredible company called

412
00:18:57.216 --> 00:18:59.917
the AAA Association.

413
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:03.551
He was very, very supportive of Rife,

414
00:19:03.551 --> 00:19:07.437
and we can determine this from all of the correspondence

415
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:08.753
and letters.

416
00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:12.311
Now Milbank Johnson was so overwhelmed

417
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:15.538
by the early stages

418
00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:18.176
of information he received from Rife,

419
00:19:18.176 --> 00:19:21.654
that he contacted his good friend Arthur Kendall

420
00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:23.840
of Northwestern University,

421
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.925
and E. C. Rosenow of the Mayo Clinic.

422
00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:30.705
This really was the core team.

423
00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:33.990
Those were the individuals that we find the majority

424
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.547
of the letters and correspondence

425
00:19:36.547 --> 00:19:39.428
back and forth from each other.

426
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:42.268
<v ->Were these some of the primary people that were involved</v>

427
00:19:42.268 --> 00:19:45.408
in the famous study,

428
00:19:45.408 --> 00:19:47.408
the clinical study

429
00:19:47.408 --> 00:19:49.265
with the 16 patients?

430
00:19:49.265 --> 00:19:52.428
<v ->Yes, the 16 terminal patients that went to the</v>

431
00:19:52.428 --> 00:19:56.187
Mary Ellen Scripps Ranch in La Jolla, California,

432
00:19:56.187 --> 00:19:58.092
they were involved.

433
00:19:58.092 --> 00:20:00.158
There was a team of doctors,

434
00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:04.064
actually George Dock of the University of California,

435
00:20:04.064 --> 00:20:07.348
there were several of these doctors who

436
00:20:07.348 --> 00:20:09.911
were purportedly involved in this study.

437
00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:12.216
Now it's a little hazy because

438
00:20:12.216 --> 00:20:14.892
very few of us were alive at the time when this

439
00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:18.781
was being done, and we can only go by letters.

440
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:22.805
I have a few letters talking about this special

441
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:27.251
research committee formed out of USC

442
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:31.340
by Rufus von KleinSmid who was the president of USC,

443
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.100
where they were talking about the study

444
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.721
and the results of the study,

445
00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:38.780
and they actually had been talking about

446
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.500
some of the patients.

447
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.004
So there is information about that

448
00:20:45.403 --> 00:20:48.028
that we have and it appeared, again,

449
00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:50.941
that they were all clinically cured

450
00:20:50.941 --> 00:20:52.881
by these medical doctors

451
00:20:52.891 --> 00:20:55.575
who examined them before and then after--

452
00:20:55.575 --> 00:20:57.011
<v ->And they were write-offs,</v>

453
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:59.841
they were terminally ill in each case, I believe.

454
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:02.471
<v ->Yes, but again, in all honesty</v>

455
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:05.906
we can only go by the letters that we have

456
00:21:05.906 --> 00:21:08.893
and the way that they spoke about the cases,

457
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.668
and how they were progressing before they started

458
00:21:12.668 --> 00:21:14.002
the treatments.

459
00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:17.671
It would appear that these people really didn't have any

460
00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:21.122
upside, positive potential here, at that particular time.

461
00:21:21.122 --> 00:21:22.553
<v ->Right.</v>

462
00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:26.520
What is fascinating and the reason that I'm being,

463
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.238
not hesitating but just trying to stay with clarity--

464
00:21:29.238 --> 00:21:30.558
<v ->Stay cautious, yes.</v>

465
00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:33.167
<v ->With the documentation at the time.</v>

466
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:37.064
Several of those doctors would later recant

467
00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:39.976
with letters to the FDA,

468
00:21:40.157 --> 00:21:41.998
in 1964,

469
00:21:41.998 --> 00:21:43.507
claiming

470
00:21:43.507 --> 00:21:47.247
that they really didn't participate

471
00:21:47.247 --> 00:21:49.132
in a study.

472
00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:53.739
I'm sharing this because I have letters from them

473
00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:57.080
back in 1934,

474
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.874
sharing information about these cases,

475
00:22:00.874 --> 00:22:04.415
and talking about how they did do research.

476
00:22:04.415 --> 00:22:06.828
But in 64,

477
00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:10.167
documents were presented to the court,

478
00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.508
this was a court case

479
00:22:12.508 --> 00:22:14.988
where John Crane lost

480
00:22:14.988 --> 00:22:17.675
and was thrown in jail for three years.

481
00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:19.874
None of these doctors appeared,

482
00:22:19.874 --> 00:22:24.349
but the FDA produced letters from these doctors saying,

483
00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:27.357
we really didn't know anything about cancer

484
00:22:27.357 --> 00:22:30.452
and we're not really sure about the microscopes.

485
00:22:30.452 --> 00:22:33.895
<v ->But none the less, the 16 people,</v>

486
00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:37.746
14 write off within 70 days and then within 60 more days

487
00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:40.405
the other two appeared to all go into remission.

488
00:22:40.405 --> 00:22:42.736
The ones that had cancer and there was some tuberculosis

489
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.481
I understand in that, too, right?

490
00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:45.940
<v ->Exactly.</v>

491
00:22:46.071 --> 00:22:48.486
The documentation is there,

492
00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:52.974
the question is why the doctors found it so important

493
00:22:52.974 --> 00:22:54.930
to recant at the end.

494
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.079
However, they did not appear in person,

495
00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:01.451
and they were later both found,

496
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:03.899
the two individuals that letters were produced.

497
00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:06.044
One of 'em was Arthur Kendall,

498
00:23:06.044 --> 00:23:08.550
they could never be questioned because they died shortly

499
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.275
after that.

500
00:23:11.007 --> 00:23:15.628
Again, you brought up a beautiful statement about

501
00:23:15.628 --> 00:23:20.214
everybody around it, touching it, has had difficulties.

502
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.246
It's happened to the people who were looking

503
00:23:22.246 --> 00:23:24.006
through the microscope,

504
00:23:24.006 --> 00:23:27.162
it has happened with the people who have tried to hold on

505
00:23:27.162 --> 00:23:29.209
and clutch that microscope.

506
00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:33.209
It has been piranhas from the people trying to grab

507
00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:35.369
and have their piece of history.

508
00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:37.145
There has been

509
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:41.171
a controversy surrounding that microscope all the time.

510
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:44.421
The bottom line for us always to remember,

511
00:23:44.421 --> 00:23:46.723
they were great researchers.

512
00:23:46.723 --> 00:23:49.829
The documentation is overwhelming.

513
00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:53.475
The microscope, I have researched it and continue

514
00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:55.063
to gather data,

515
00:23:55.063 --> 00:23:59.393
and my opinion of it has only gone up higher

516
00:23:59.393 --> 00:24:02.391
and is never lessened one bit, Regina,

517
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:04.405
in all of these years.

518
00:24:04.405 --> 00:24:07.547
It is truly an incredible story.

519
00:24:08.744 --> 00:24:11.650
<v ->It's an unfathomable story in certain ways,</v>

520
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.073
that these kinds of,

521
00:24:16.592 --> 00:24:18.301
the kind of,

522
00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:21.987
what am I trying to say that he's been exposed to?

523
00:24:21.987 --> 00:24:25.226
In essence the witch hunt that occurred all along the way,

524
00:24:25.226 --> 00:24:27.996
and still continues in a sense, to this day.

525
00:24:27.996 --> 00:24:29.429
Was allowed to continue,

526
00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:31.693
and that really there was no one that could stand up

527
00:24:31.693 --> 00:24:34.563
against those pressures of the day.

528
00:24:35.491 --> 00:24:37.779
<v ->I'm giving some PR to them,</v>

529
00:24:37.779 --> 00:24:39.464
we didn't have 60 Minutes,

530
00:24:39.464 --> 00:24:41.466
we didn't have 20/20,

531
00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:43.689
or we didn't have a Larry King,

532
00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:47.317
where 20 million people hear your story overnight.

533
00:24:47.317 --> 00:24:48.222
<v ->Right.</v>

534
00:24:48.222 --> 00:24:52.277
<v ->We didn't have that internet that goes all over the world.</v>

535
00:24:52.277 --> 00:24:54.286
So in the little pocket

536
00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:57.476
where these individuals were working

537
00:24:57.476 --> 00:25:01.164
things were buried over them,

538
00:25:01.164 --> 00:25:04.333
were pushed over them so that really, it never got out.

539
00:25:04.333 --> 00:25:07.074
When you look at the newspaper articles that appeared

540
00:25:07.074 --> 00:25:09.921
during the day, and we have all of the newspaper articles,

541
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:11.639
the Christian Science Monitor,

542
00:25:11.639 --> 00:25:13.313
there were things that came out in

543
00:25:13.313 --> 00:25:15.466
California and Western Medicine.

544
00:25:15.466 --> 00:25:18.820
There were articles the Smithsonian Institute.

545
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.045
It really, during a different era, would've really had

546
00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.772
great PR exposure,

547
00:25:24.772 --> 00:25:26.943
but during that period,

548
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:30.405
it was very easy just to quiet everything down

549
00:25:30.405 --> 00:25:34.083
and slowly it sank and disappeared,

550
00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:36.305
and was lost.

551
00:25:38.742 --> 00:25:41.815
When I received it and was placing some calls myself

552
00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:43.969
to different areas,

553
00:25:43.969 --> 00:25:46.967
in scientific circles they were telling me,

554
00:25:46.967 --> 00:25:50.825
it never existed, we don't have any information on it.

555
00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:54.750
And that was clearly nonsense because I had it

556
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.405
with my arm around it literally,

557
00:25:57.405 --> 00:25:59.439
calling on the telephone having people tell me

558
00:25:59.439 --> 00:26:01.860
it didn't exist and it wasn't real.

559
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.286
<v ->And you also have the famous picture.</v>

560
00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:07.972
I don't think there's been any sort of documentary

561
00:26:07.972 --> 00:26:11.219
or work done on Rife that doesn't show the famous picture,

562
00:26:11.219 --> 00:26:14.068
where the doctors gathered with great hope,

563
00:26:14.068 --> 00:26:15.586
what was it, 1930?

564
00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:18.686
<v ->It was 1931, it was a dinner party.</v>

565
00:26:18.686 --> 00:26:21.987
According to the LA Times articles which we have,

566
00:26:21.987 --> 00:26:24.778
it was the dinner party celebrating

567
00:26:24.778 --> 00:26:27.179
the end of disease and illness.

568
00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:28.059
<v ->Right.</v>

569
00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:30.764
<v ->And it was an incredible, yes, and we have that picture--</v>

570
00:26:30.764 --> 00:26:32.761
<v ->Which we're showing.</v>

571
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:36.576
Now there's a piece of this,

572
00:26:36.576 --> 00:26:40.357
if anybody is not familiar and watching this and intrigued,

573
00:26:40.357 --> 00:26:41.987
you're talking about a microscope,

574
00:26:41.987 --> 00:26:43.310
but then we're also talking about

575
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.015
a frequency generating device.

576
00:26:45.015 --> 00:26:46.747
<v ->Regina, you are so wise.</v>

577
00:26:46.747 --> 00:26:48.003
(both laughing)

578
00:26:48.003 --> 00:26:51.079
And really that is the crux of the story.

579
00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:52.639
Because,

580
00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:55.949
the danger to particular people,

581
00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:57.981
and I'm using the word danger,

582
00:26:57.981 --> 00:27:01.404
was not the microscope.

583
00:27:01.404 --> 00:27:05.432
It was what was seen through the microscope

584
00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:09.971
and it was the tool that was developed because of that.

585
00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:12.729
To make it very, very simplistic,

586
00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:16.956
because of the unique properties of this microscope,

587
00:27:16.956 --> 00:27:19.886
any microbe or bacteria glowed

588
00:27:19.886 --> 00:27:21.808
in a particular color.

589
00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:25.201
A color is a rate of frequency.

590
00:27:25.529 --> 00:27:29.534
So if we see a color, we can determine the frequency.

591
00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:32.607
I'm sure you have quite scientific people,

592
00:27:32.607 --> 00:27:34.847
but we also will have an audience of laypersons

593
00:27:34.847 --> 00:27:37.022
so let's keep it very simple.

594
00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:40.214
The idea is, once there is that color,

595
00:27:40.214 --> 00:27:42.711
this is the emanating frequency coming from

596
00:27:42.711 --> 00:27:44.641
this microorganism,

597
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:47.243
these doctors and scientists reasoned

598
00:27:47.243 --> 00:27:49.003
by the law of resonance,

599
00:27:49.003 --> 00:27:52.096
the same way that when a singer will sing

600
00:27:52.096 --> 00:27:54.389
and hit a particular note.

601
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:58.091
A glass will shatter, but not all the glass.

602
00:27:58.091 --> 00:28:01.907
Only the glass that resonates at that particular frequency.

603
00:28:01.907 --> 00:28:05.610
So now they peered through this microscope

604
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.669
and they had, let's take a microbe of cancer.

605
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:11.144
I'm not even gonna say virus because there was debate

606
00:28:11.144 --> 00:28:14.259
about whether there was really a virus cancer or not.

607
00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:17.259
But here they had this microbe that they had isolated.

608
00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:19.392
It had a particular color.

609
00:28:19.392 --> 00:28:22.134
They then met with Dr. Lee de Forest

610
00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:24.651
who was the father of modern radio tubes,

611
00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:27.936
who had built a frequency generator.

612
00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:30.152
They turned the dial,

613
00:28:30.152 --> 00:28:32.691
with the frequency beaming at the slide,

614
00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:34.537
they peered through the microscope,

615
00:28:34.537 --> 00:28:36.797
and went the color went out,

616
00:28:36.797 --> 00:28:40.126
the microorganism was killed instantly

617
00:28:40.126 --> 00:28:44.147
the same way as when the singer hits that exact note.

618
00:28:44.147 --> 00:28:47.560
The microorganism, gone, dead,

619
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.288
destroyed, finished.

620
00:28:49.288 --> 00:28:52.902
And so they found the Mortal Oscillatory frequency

621
00:28:52.902 --> 00:28:56.294
for 60 different diseases and illnesses

622
00:28:56.294 --> 00:28:57.737
based on that.

623
00:28:57.737 --> 00:29:00.561
So it was really the frequency device

624
00:29:00.561 --> 00:29:03.138
that was the therapeutic part.

625
00:29:03.318 --> 00:29:07.875
It's interesting if you read the obituary of Rife

626
00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:11.364
because there's a quote by him at the very end of this,

627
00:29:11.364 --> 00:29:13.759
and I believe he died in the 70s.

628
00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:15.166
<v ->71, I think.
<v ->It said,</v>

629
00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:19.612
"All I tried to do was to invent

630
00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:22.806
a microscope that would help people,"

631
00:29:22.806 --> 00:29:25.574
but he never realized that

632
00:29:25.574 --> 00:29:28.160
this firestorm

633
00:29:28.362 --> 00:29:31.136
of things that came back at him,

634
00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:34.112
all he did was try to develop something.

635
00:29:34.112 --> 00:29:36.446
But it was a lot of vested interests

636
00:29:36.446 --> 00:29:38.399
that really kept it down.

637
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:43.231
And unfortunately, has kept it away from people all over

638
00:29:43.231 --> 00:29:44.924
the world.

639
00:29:46.002 --> 00:29:47.397
<v ->Okay.</v>

640
00:29:47.397 --> 00:29:49.748
Yes, and that continues.

641
00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:52.026
So going back just a moment to what you were

642
00:29:52.026 --> 00:29:53.230
just talking about.

643
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.437
You had the frequency generating device,

644
00:29:55.437 --> 00:29:57.857
you had the microscope that was sophisticated enough

645
00:29:57.857 --> 00:30:01.385
to be able to identify the frequencies so that they could

646
00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:05.321
then project the right electrical frequency at it,

647
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:06.770
and then destroy it.

648
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.695
But then you also had

649
00:30:08.695 --> 00:30:11.836
a body of 30 years of protocol that were developed.

650
00:30:11.836 --> 00:30:15.614
<v ->Now I saw personally, at the time, John Crane had</v>

651
00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:18.881
10,000 slides

652
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:20.936
in his garage.

653
00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:24.281
In fact, he was having such a garage clean up with me,

654
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:27.374
the reason he wanted the station wagon was,

655
00:30:27.374 --> 00:30:31.125
he wanted to give me more than just the microscope.

656
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:33.326
He was giving me all kinds of other devices

657
00:30:33.326 --> 00:30:36.102
and he wanted to give me slides, and I looked at that,

658
00:30:36.102 --> 00:30:39.451
I would've needed a semi-truck to take it all back.

659
00:30:39.451 --> 00:30:42.971
And at the time, I was looking and I didn't see

660
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:44.453
so much of a need for that,

661
00:30:44.453 --> 00:30:46.932
or maybe I was just being a layperson going,

662
00:30:46.932 --> 00:30:48.654
I donno if I want
(laughing)

663
00:30:48.654 --> 00:30:52.287
10,000 slides of something floating in the back of the

664
00:30:52.287 --> 00:30:53.740
station wagon.

665
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.291
So I left those,

666
00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:57.893
but there was no question that

667
00:30:57.893 --> 00:30:59.952
however many years they spent,

668
00:30:59.952 --> 00:31:02.199
they were great researchers.

669
00:31:02.199 --> 00:31:05.408
All of the letters demonstrates,

670
00:31:05.408 --> 00:31:06.513
and again,

671
00:31:06.513 --> 00:31:08.471
these letters from the 30s that I have,

672
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:11.415
I actually have from the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.

673
00:31:11.415 --> 00:31:13.317
But from the 20s and 30s,

674
00:31:13.317 --> 00:31:16.255
they never assumed that those letters would be made public

675
00:31:16.255 --> 00:31:18.095
or become a movie of the week.

676
00:31:18.095 --> 00:31:20.250
They wrote from their heart.

677
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.593
You could see what type of people they were,

678
00:31:23.593 --> 00:31:25.577
what kind of researchers,

679
00:31:25.577 --> 00:31:27.753
how scientific, how solid.

680
00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:30.832
But now I'm gonna throw you a little loop-de-loop,

681
00:31:30.832 --> 00:31:32.614
a little bonus here.
<v ->Kay.</v>

682
00:31:32.614 --> 00:31:36.443
<v ->Because, all the different microbes and bacterias</v>

683
00:31:36.443 --> 00:31:38.052
and health problems,

684
00:31:38.052 --> 00:31:40.615
needed different frequencies

685
00:31:40.615 --> 00:31:43.898
to devitalize them or destroy them,

686
00:31:43.898 --> 00:31:46.212
which they wrote down.

687
00:31:46.212 --> 00:31:48.483
One letter that I have

688
00:31:48.483 --> 00:31:51.382
talks about one day,

689
00:31:51.382 --> 00:31:55.030
something happened in their laboratory.

690
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.971
I'm just paraphrasing but I'll be as close as I can.

691
00:31:58.971 --> 00:32:01.729
The individual writing said,

692
00:32:03.537 --> 00:32:06.983
the machine all the sudden hit a frequency

693
00:32:06.983 --> 00:32:10.843
and every experiment in the laboratory

694
00:32:10.843 --> 00:32:13.280
was instantly ruined

695
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.575
because every microbe and virus and bacteria,

696
00:32:17.575 --> 00:32:20.831
everything they had was instantly killed.

697
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:22.081
<v ->With this one frequency?</v>

698
00:32:22.081 --> 00:32:23.196
<v ->One frequency.</v>

699
00:32:23.196 --> 00:32:24.754
And here are the hints,

700
00:32:24.754 --> 00:32:26.760
the mold

701
00:32:27.471 --> 00:32:30.633
slid off the leather chair.

702
00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:34.806
And one window in the bathroom

703
00:32:34.806 --> 00:32:36.446
broke.

704
00:32:36.606 --> 00:32:40.679
And we had to pinch ourselves to see if we were all

705
00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:44.938
still alive, or we had crossed over to the other side.

706
00:32:44.938 --> 00:32:46.361
<v ->(chuckling) Oh my God.</v>

707
00:32:46.361 --> 00:32:50.728
<v ->Because all the test animals were still alive.</v>

708
00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:53.239
They were still alive,

709
00:32:53.239 --> 00:32:55.696
but every microbe,

710
00:32:55.867 --> 00:32:58.540
everything, every pathogen

711
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.635
affiliated with a disease or illness

712
00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:05.271
was instantly destroyed, Regina.

713
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:07.189
<v ->Do we know what that--
<v ->No.</v>

714
00:33:07.846 --> 00:33:10.277
With everything that they did,

715
00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:13.988
I scoured, because I had every letter.

716
00:33:13.988 --> 00:33:16.777
They didn't put that frequency down.

717
00:33:16.777 --> 00:33:17.980
(discouraged exhale)

718
00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:22.423
<v ->And remember, they didn't have state of the art circuitry</v>

719
00:33:22.423 --> 00:33:23.683
back then,

720
00:33:23.683 --> 00:33:26.441
so the frequencies are a little bit different because

721
00:33:26.441 --> 00:33:30.370
they would've not been able to have been held

722
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.013
like today's frequencies.

723
00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:34.739
That was all they said.

724
00:33:34.739 --> 00:33:37.448
But it was amazing to be reading this

725
00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:39.453
and come across that where somebody says

726
00:33:39.453 --> 00:33:41.334
we had to pinch ourselves to see if we were

727
00:33:41.334 --> 00:33:42.578
(both laughing)
<v ->If we were still alive.</v>

728
00:33:42.578 --> 00:33:44.250
<v ->If we were still alive because,</v>

729
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.199
and they said every experiment was ruined.

730
00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:49.507
But they were being facetious because on the other side

731
00:33:49.507 --> 00:33:51.389
<v ->It killed everything, right.
<v ->It killed everything.</v>

732
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:52.515
Yes, every pathogen.

733
00:33:52.515 --> 00:33:54.755
<v ->Absolutely amazing, and we to this day don't know</v>

734
00:33:54.755 --> 00:33:56.091
what that frequency was.

735
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:57.779
<v ->We have no idea.</v>

736
00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:00.918
<v ->Well, let's start coming toward this day.</v>

737
00:34:00.918 --> 00:34:03.297
In fact when we first spoke.

738
00:34:03.297 --> 00:34:05.483
<v ->I was much younger when we first spoke.</v>

739
00:34:05.483 --> 00:34:07.797
<v ->Well it was a year and half or so ago. (laughing)</v>

740
00:34:07.797 --> 00:34:09.157
<v ->I was a younger guy with more--</v>

741
00:34:09.157 --> 00:34:10.438
<v ->With loads of hair, right? (laughs)</v>

742
00:34:10.438 --> 00:34:12.088
<v ->With loads of hair, exactly.
(laughing)

743
00:34:12.088 --> 00:34:13.806
A flop-top.

744
00:34:14.126 --> 00:34:16.297
<v ->When we first spoke, one of the things we started</v>

745
00:34:16.297 --> 00:34:18.195
talking about was this subject,

746
00:34:18.195 --> 00:34:21.399
and it turns out that we had known some mutual people

747
00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:24.506
in Germany that we had each interviewed

748
00:34:24.506 --> 00:34:26.626
back in the mid 80s.

749
00:34:26.626 --> 00:34:28.692
You were on the hunt back then
<v ->Right.</v>

750
00:34:28.692 --> 00:34:31.132
<v ->On another track entirely, I ended up there</v>

751
00:34:31.132 --> 00:34:34.697
because I was looking for the answers

752
00:34:35.313 --> 00:34:37.700
having to do with vibrational healing,

753
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.708
and particularly color therapy which about the same year

754
00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:42.546
you were reading about Dinshah and Rife,

755
00:34:42.546 --> 00:34:43.686
so was I.

756
00:34:43.686 --> 00:34:48.121
Which lead us both to a man named, Kurt,

757
00:34:48.121 --> 00:34:52.381
and his famous Ergonom 400 microscope.

758
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:53.751
<v ->Right.</v>

759
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:56.000
<v ->Which theoretically</v>

760
00:34:57.023 --> 00:34:59.506
well in reality had the capability, didn't it,

761
00:34:59.506 --> 00:35:01.647
to do pretty much what Rife's microscope does.

762
00:35:01.647 --> 00:35:04.506
<v ->Yes, but it was because of the Rife microscope</v>

763
00:35:04.506 --> 00:35:07.588
that the Ergonom 400 is being used in medicine today.

764
00:35:07.588 --> 00:35:08.910
Because,

765
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.352
during our World Congress in 1986,

766
00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:16.553
I had flown speakers from various countries

767
00:35:16.553 --> 00:35:19.425
of which Bernhard Muschlien came in

768
00:35:19.425 --> 00:35:22.242
from Wiesbaden in Germany.

769
00:35:22.242 --> 00:35:24.483
We also had Bjorn Nordenstrom of Sweden,

770
00:35:24.483 --> 00:35:27.304
who is the past chairman of the Nobel Assembly.

771
00:35:27.304 --> 00:35:30.968
and Fritz Popp, we had a great collection of people.

772
00:35:30.968 --> 00:35:32.752
Now as a special treat,

773
00:35:32.752 --> 00:35:37.008
on one of the days I took all of our speakers into a room,

774
00:35:37.008 --> 00:35:38.360
and hyped it up,

775
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.933
I'm an Aquarius, and made it really exciting.

776
00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:44.033
And unveiled the Rife microscope.

777
00:35:44.733 --> 00:35:48.316
These doctors, they were overwhelmed because

778
00:35:48.316 --> 00:35:50.971
they really had never heard the story,

779
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:54.972
once they heard the story they were amazed.

780
00:35:56.547 --> 00:36:00.417
Bernhard goes back and he happens to mention

781
00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:03.318
to someone in Germany that he had just seen

782
00:36:03.318 --> 00:36:05.902
a super microscope from the 20s,

783
00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:08.985
and the gentlemen tells him, "Oh,

784
00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:12.504
there is a man who's got a super microscope

785
00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.307
named Kurt."
<v ->Kurt.</v>

786
00:36:14.307 --> 00:36:18.211
<v ->And Muschlien thought that was fascinating.</v>

787
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:21.699
So Muschlien goes out and visits this man,

788
00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:23.630
and comes to find out,

789
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.995
Kurt had developed his super microscope to examine

790
00:36:27.995 --> 00:36:30.720
flaws in computer chips.

791
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.543
<v ->Right.</v>

792
00:36:31.543 --> 00:36:34.041
<v ->Had never used it, ever, for anything</v>

793
00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:35.403
having to do without.
(laughing)

794
00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:37.565
So Muschlien says to him,

795
00:36:37.565 --> 00:36:39.505
"Why aren't you doing anything in health?"

796
00:36:39.505 --> 00:36:41.443
And Kurt's answer was,

797
00:36:41.443 --> 00:36:43.260
"They have microscopes don't they?

798
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.655
They're using stuff
(laughing)

799
00:36:44.655 --> 00:36:45.800
and doing research."

800
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.325
Not realizing that his is about 20 times more powerful.

801
00:36:50.325 --> 00:36:52.860
So after he heard this from Muschlien

802
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.620
the two of them really started their researching together.

803
00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.698
And so it was because of the Rife at that particular time

804
00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:03.000
that Kurt's microscope has been used.

805
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.794
<v ->Well I'm going to see if I can</v>

806
00:37:05.794 --> 00:37:07.258
make this happen,

807
00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:11.931
but they gave us some of the original video

808
00:37:11.931 --> 00:37:13.831
of the AIDS virus

809
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:17.330
and some live cancer cells,

810
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.951
that they were working with at that time.

811
00:37:20.083 --> 00:37:23.129
At that time, they were putting forth

812
00:37:23.129 --> 00:37:26.631
that the cancer cell's actually a virus

813
00:37:26.631 --> 00:37:28.181
that mutates.
<v ->Right.</v>

814
00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:29.974
Pleomorphism.
<v ->That's right.</v>

815
00:37:29.974 --> 00:37:32.055
And they were working on that and they were

816
00:37:32.055 --> 00:37:35.869
doing video tapes of the slides.

817
00:37:35.869 --> 00:37:37.039
So I have some of that

818
00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:39.842
and I'm going to see if we can round that up

819
00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:41.455
and insert some of that in this.

820
00:37:41.455 --> 00:37:43.085
<v ->I may be able to help you.</v>

821
00:37:43.085 --> 00:37:43.982
<v ->Thank you.</v>

822
00:37:43.982 --> 00:37:45.036
<v ->Because,</v>

823
00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:47.382
we actually were given two videos here.

824
00:37:47.382 --> 00:37:48.284
<v ->You were?</v>

825
00:37:48.284 --> 00:37:49.194
<v ->Yes.</v>

826
00:37:49.194 --> 00:37:51.103
<v ->I wonder if they're the same videos we were given?</v>

827
00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:52.999
<v ->I'm sure they were but,</v>

828
00:37:52.999 --> 00:37:54.173
<v ->If you have them--</v>

829
00:37:54.173 --> 00:37:56.017
<v ->We showed them in our 1990 Congress</v>

830
00:37:56.017 --> 00:37:58.259
but I had to sign something in blood

831
00:37:58.259 --> 00:38:02.525
that we would never make a video at that particular time.

832
00:38:02.525 --> 00:38:06.345
But it was showing the legionelles problem,

833
00:38:06.345 --> 00:38:08.341
and the AIDS, so I do--

834
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:10.219
<v ->It may be the same one, so if I can find it,</v>

835
00:38:10.219 --> 00:38:11.344
maybe you can.

836
00:38:11.344 --> 00:38:12.751
<v ->We'll see what we can come up with.</v>

837
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:15.188
<v ->Yeah, and actually,</v>

838
00:38:15.351 --> 00:38:18.273
for better or for worse I did a story that was on CNN

839
00:38:18.273 --> 00:38:21.407
on the microscope in 1988.

840
00:38:21.407 --> 00:38:23.577
<v ->See, you have the glory jobs</v>

841
00:38:23.577 --> 00:38:25.240
and I'm a poor librarian
(laughing)

842
00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.952
who works in catacombs all day.

843
00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:29.961
<v ->The point was,</v>

844
00:38:29.961 --> 00:38:33.878
as glory filled as this job can be in moments,

845
00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:36.080
why did nothing ever happen after that?

846
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.361
That's the only report I know of that ever went out

847
00:38:38.361 --> 00:38:41.479
on this technology, which is the modern day Rife.

848
00:38:41.479 --> 00:38:43.396
Now what's going on?

849
00:38:43.396 --> 00:38:46.152
Because I lost track of them at that point,

850
00:38:46.152 --> 00:38:47.571
and never heard anything about it again

851
00:38:47.571 --> 00:38:50.228
except to see that it had been apparently loaned

852
00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:54.272
to UC Northridge to do some research.

853
00:38:54.272 --> 00:38:56.138
Haven't heard anything since.

854
00:38:56.138 --> 00:38:57.521
What's going on?

855
00:38:57.521 --> 00:39:00.796
<v ->I believe that again, because of the era that we live in</v>

856
00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:02.976
which is not a perfect era

857
00:39:02.976 --> 00:39:06.191
where trust is at a premium here,

858
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:09.412
there was fear that having a wide disbursement

859
00:39:09.412 --> 00:39:13.139
of this Ergonom 400,

860
00:39:13.283 --> 00:39:16.633
would open and make it susceptible to be copied

861
00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:18.369
and duplicated.

862
00:39:18.369 --> 00:39:21.047
Therefore, at the time it was only given to

863
00:39:21.047 --> 00:39:22.756
a few universities.

864
00:39:22.756 --> 00:39:26.863
I believe a university in England and possibly one in Japan,

865
00:39:26.863 --> 00:39:29.129
and a place in the United States

866
00:39:29.129 --> 00:39:30.931
where they could conduct research,

867
00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:33.353
and validate by grids,

868
00:39:33.353 --> 00:39:36.553
what the true magnification is.

869
00:39:36.553 --> 00:39:41.009
Because sometimes, people can use a projection microscope

870
00:39:41.009 --> 00:39:45.004
and it's projecting a bigger size, but you're really not

871
00:39:45.004 --> 00:39:48.610
increasing the diameters of your vision, there.

872
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.020
So somebody can say, well,

873
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.254
I have a microscope and it's doing this,

874
00:39:53.254 --> 00:39:55.911
and all it is is just projecting the image

875
00:39:55.911 --> 00:39:57.639
in a larger manner,

876
00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:00.847
but you really not getting a depth to that.

877
00:40:00.847 --> 00:40:02.755
But they did have the depth,

878
00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:06.491
and I think that that's what they were examining.

879
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:10.242
The great fear that they had was that if they patent it,

880
00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:14.198
that the technology could disappear.

881
00:40:14.198 --> 00:40:17.495
Which brings us up, you and I both had a discussion

882
00:40:17.495 --> 00:40:20.707
that the technologies were not the same.

883
00:40:20.707 --> 00:40:22.430
Rife's technology,

884
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.232
and based on what I was able to learn about the Ergonom 400,

885
00:40:26.232 --> 00:40:28.122
not the same.

886
00:40:28.474 --> 00:40:31.530
In actuality, the Ergonom 400 might have

887
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.882
the greater capability

888
00:40:34.249 --> 00:40:36.438
of great magnification,

889
00:40:36.438 --> 00:40:37.963
that's what they had told me at the time.

890
00:40:37.963 --> 00:40:39.627
<v ->Kurt said at the time that they were capable</v>

891
00:40:39.627 --> 00:40:41.600
of 50,000 times in natural light.

892
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.531
Now that's what electron microscopes,

893
00:40:43.531 --> 00:40:45.299
which kill whatever's in there,

894
00:40:45.299 --> 00:40:47.183
were doing at the time.

895
00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:49.336
Things have changed since then, it's been 20 years,

896
00:40:49.336 --> 00:40:51.757
but still nothing has surfaced any more powerful

897
00:40:51.757 --> 00:40:53.499
than this for natural light, has it?

898
00:40:53.499 --> 00:40:54.437
<v ->No.</v>

899
00:40:54.437 --> 00:40:57.242
It hasn't, those are really the two microscopes

900
00:40:57.242 --> 00:40:59.300
other than the Nemascope.

901
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.489
<v ->Yes which is just on the tip of my tongue.</v>

902
00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:04.382
Now tell us that story, this is amazing.

903
00:41:04.382 --> 00:41:08.161
<v ->The Nemascope was developed by an inventor</v>

904
00:41:08.161 --> 00:41:12.685
in Hollywood, California back in the 50s,

905
00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:14.497
and supposedly

906
00:41:14.497 --> 00:41:18.202
this microscope saw down to the atomic level.

907
00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:21.162
This was not a wives' tale because

908
00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:23.424
there is some paperwork left.

909
00:41:23.424 --> 00:41:25.005
The difficulty was

910
00:41:25.005 --> 00:41:28.385
that this Nemascope,

911
00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:31.628
or if I'm pronouncing it incorrectly,

912
00:41:31.628 --> 00:41:34.254
could be either neh-mas or nee-mas.

913
00:41:34.254 --> 00:41:37.262
But the Nemascope was stolen

914
00:41:37.262 --> 00:41:39.642
from the laboratory

915
00:41:39.642 --> 00:41:41.779
where the inventor had built it.

916
00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:45.969
Now Tom Valentine in Magnets magazine, September 1986,

917
00:41:45.969 --> 00:41:49.772
wrote an incredible article about this.

918
00:41:49.772 --> 00:41:52.757
He was very familiar with Rife and he said

919
00:41:52.757 --> 00:41:55.577
the Nemascope made the Rife microscope

920
00:41:55.577 --> 00:41:57.435
look like a Tinkertoy.
(chuckles)

921
00:41:57.435 --> 00:41:59.147
That the pictures

922
00:41:59.147 --> 00:42:02.447
that they have from that are so dramatic.

923
00:42:02.447 --> 00:42:06.087
Now Betty Lee Morales, who was a researcher,

924
00:42:06.087 --> 00:42:09.301
and from what I understand and ex-CIA agent,

925
00:42:09.301 --> 00:42:11.113
started the Cancer Control Society,

926
00:42:11.113 --> 00:42:13.153
or was one of the founding members.

927
00:42:13.153 --> 00:42:17.265
Had the only book at the time of the Nemascope

928
00:42:17.265 --> 00:42:18.673
showing these pictures,

929
00:42:18.673 --> 00:42:20.383
which I was showing you a little bit earlier.

930
00:42:20.383 --> 00:42:21.218
<v ->Unbelievable.</v>

931
00:42:21.218 --> 00:42:23.251
<v ->They are truly unbelievable.</v>

932
00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:27.842
And that just opens up a whole other aspect of technology,

933
00:42:27.842 --> 00:42:30.984
which, Regina, when we really think about it,

934
00:42:31.624 --> 00:42:33.987
there are so many things that are out there,

935
00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:35.862
there are so many technologies,

936
00:42:35.862 --> 00:42:38.967
there's so many inventions,

937
00:42:38.967 --> 00:42:42.677
that whenever we think that we do know it all,

938
00:42:42.677 --> 00:42:47.098
we find out that there is another great technology.

939
00:42:47.098 --> 00:42:51.355
In this era that we have of wonderful communication,

940
00:42:51.355 --> 00:42:54.268
in those old days or bygone days

941
00:42:54.268 --> 00:42:56.467
where it wasn't so prevalent,

942
00:42:56.467 --> 00:42:59.999
people made incredible discoveries that we have bypassed

943
00:42:59.999 --> 00:43:01.705
and overlooked,

944
00:43:01.705 --> 00:43:04.576
and all of a sudden they're bubbling and surfacing,

945
00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:08.639
because this Nemascope is just incredible.

946
00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:11.485
It was also never patented

947
00:43:11.743 --> 00:43:15.981
as the Rife microscope at the time wasn't patented either.

948
00:43:16.125 --> 00:43:18.779
And we had the Ergonom 400 at the time,

949
00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:21.636
that wasn't patented, so who knows what's out there.

950
00:43:21.636 --> 00:43:23.335
<v ->And probably for good reason.</v>

951
00:43:23.335 --> 00:43:24.305
<v ->Right.</v>

952
00:43:24.305 --> 00:43:26.338
<v ->Because they knew that's one surefire way</v>

953
00:43:26.338 --> 00:43:27.799
to lose your technology, (chuckles)

954
00:43:27.799 --> 00:43:29.474
just try to apply for a patent on that.

955
00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:30.935
<v ->Exactly.</v>

956
00:43:32.401 --> 00:43:33.901
<v ->One of the things that I find interesting</v>

957
00:43:33.901 --> 00:43:35.017
about all of this

958
00:43:35.017 --> 00:43:37.622
is now we're getting the smaller,

959
00:43:37.622 --> 00:43:39.882
more cost effective

960
00:43:39.882 --> 00:43:41.190
frequency generators.

961
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.331
Technology is allowing for production of some

962
00:43:43.331 --> 00:43:45.729
fairly interesting things right now.

963
00:43:45.729 --> 00:43:48.717
And the protocols,

964
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.185
some of the protocols still appear to exist,

965
00:43:52.185 --> 00:43:54.968
and there's continuing work being done on the protocols.

966
00:43:54.968 --> 00:43:56.858
<v ->Now you're gonna hit one of my hot buttons.</v>

967
00:43:56.858 --> 00:43:58.340
<v ->Okay, let's hit it.
<v ->Because,</v>

968
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.702
I am very frequently asked about the Rife machines

969
00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:03.842
that are out,

970
00:44:03.842 --> 00:44:06.390
the Rife Ray, the Rife frequencies.

971
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.330
It all began for me, about 10 years ago when a woman

972
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.367
from Canada called me and goes,

973
00:44:11.367 --> 00:44:13.743
"Dr. Ross, I bought one of your frequency devices

974
00:44:13.743 --> 00:44:15.099
and it's broken."

975
00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:17.909
And I thought, you bought one of my devices?

976
00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:19.914
We don't sell, we're a non-profit,

977
00:44:19.914 --> 00:44:22.315
we don't sell devices.

978
00:44:22.315 --> 00:44:25.494
There were five companies that had taken various radio shows

979
00:44:25.494 --> 00:44:29.564
that I had done, and was using these radio programs

980
00:44:29.564 --> 00:44:33.672
as part of their sales tools to sell their machines.

981
00:44:33.672 --> 00:44:36.404
Well, I contacted them,

982
00:44:36.404 --> 00:44:38.643
not looking for a piece of their action,

983
00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:41.140
but in order to keep our neutrality.

984
00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.224
And I just mentioned the L-word,

985
00:44:44.224 --> 00:44:47.272
the lawyer word, our lawyer will get in touch with you

986
00:44:47.272 --> 00:44:48.739
if you keep doing that,

987
00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:51.212
which they very quickly stopped.

988
00:44:52.743 --> 00:44:55.727
I'm not happy with these devices that are out

989
00:44:55.727 --> 00:44:57.299
is very simply,

990
00:44:57.299 --> 00:45:00.873
I am constantly approached by these companies

991
00:45:00.873 --> 00:45:03.217
and by people who have the machines,

992
00:45:03.217 --> 00:45:06.118
and I ask them a very simple question.

993
00:45:06.118 --> 00:45:09.713
Show me a before used the machine,

994
00:45:09.713 --> 00:45:11.294
and an after.

995
00:45:11.294 --> 00:45:14.256
With a medical doctor examination before,

996
00:45:14.256 --> 00:45:15.552
and a medical doctor examination--

997
00:45:15.552 --> 00:45:17.193
<v ->You talking about the pathogens?</v>

998
00:45:17.193 --> 00:45:19.444
<v ->No, anybody using these machines.</v>

999
00:45:19.444 --> 00:45:20.576
<v ->I see.</v>

1000
00:45:20.576 --> 00:45:25.272
<v ->Because I wanna see whether this particular machine</v>

1001
00:45:25.928 --> 00:45:28.178
really is working.

1002
00:45:28.178 --> 00:45:31.106
Not hearsay, not a wives' tale,

1003
00:45:31.106 --> 00:45:34.680
and something else I always ask these people.

1004
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.738
The people who are using your machines,

1005
00:45:37.863 --> 00:45:40.111
have they changed their diet?

1006
00:45:40.111 --> 00:45:41.764
Are they meditating?

1007
00:45:41.764 --> 00:45:44.175
Are they listening to different kinds of music?

1008
00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:47.217
Because if they are, is it the machine

1009
00:45:47.217 --> 00:45:49.213
or is it their lifestyle change?

1010
00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:52.449
Now here's the answer I get back all the time.

1011
00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:55.329
Steve, you know about the FDA and the AMA

1012
00:45:55.329 --> 00:45:56.933
and it's so difficult.

1013
00:45:56.933 --> 00:45:58.479
I said, look,

1014
00:45:58.479 --> 00:46:01.082
cross out the doctor's name,

1015
00:46:01.082 --> 00:46:03.332
cross out the patient's name,

1016
00:46:03.332 --> 00:46:06.314
but show me a legitimate

1017
00:46:06.314 --> 00:46:09.234
before and after examination.

1018
00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:10.806
And I'm telling you, Regina,

1019
00:46:10.806 --> 00:46:15.161
not one of these companies has produced that.

1020
00:46:16.361 --> 00:46:18.377
They use Rife's name,

1021
00:46:18.377 --> 00:46:21.126
and the reason this is my hot button is,

1022
00:46:21.126 --> 00:46:25.490
because of people putting Rife's name on a machine,

1023
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:30.009
when the local state medical authorities jump in

1024
00:46:30.009 --> 00:46:31.930
and quelch that machine,

1025
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.526
and put a ban on it in that city, state, county.

1026
00:46:36.526 --> 00:46:38.307
It's got Rife's name on it.

1027
00:46:38.307 --> 00:46:42.227
So right now Rife machines are banned in different places,

1028
00:46:42.227 --> 00:46:45.256
but they weren't really original Rife machines,

1029
00:46:45.256 --> 00:46:48.475
they're somebody's modern day knock-offs.

1030
00:46:48.485 --> 00:46:51.859
People believe that they're more intelligent than Rife.

1031
00:46:51.859 --> 00:46:55.457
"I'm a physicist and I know, and I improved this."

1032
00:46:55.457 --> 00:46:56.989
To me that's nonsense.

1033
00:46:56.989 --> 00:46:58.943
<v ->Is it possible that they may have?</v>

1034
00:46:58.943 --> 00:47:01.056
That they may have a similar genius going?

1035
00:47:01.056 --> 00:47:02.557
<v ->In my personal opinion?
<v ->Yes.</v>

1036
00:47:02.557 --> 00:47:03.446
<v ->No.</v>

1037
00:47:03.446 --> 00:47:04.497
You know why?
<v ->Why?</v>

1038
00:47:04.497 --> 00:47:07.676
You're being very dogmatic here, here's the reason.

1039
00:47:08.229 --> 00:47:12.812
Rife did what he did using frequency and running it through

1040
00:47:12.812 --> 00:47:15.586
particular gas tubes

1041
00:47:15.586 --> 00:47:18.196
to accomplish something.

1042
00:47:18.196 --> 00:47:22.512
He, as you mentioned earlier, set protocols for 30 years

1043
00:47:22.512 --> 00:47:24.966
and examined and documented them.

1044
00:47:24.966 --> 00:47:27.265
<v ->Right, because he had the Rife microscope. (laughs)</v>

1045
00:47:27.265 --> 00:47:29.781
<v ->He had the Rife microscope and he could do it.</v>

1046
00:47:29.781 --> 00:47:30.922
So,

1047
00:47:30.922 --> 00:47:33.216
I reserve my opinion

1048
00:47:33.216 --> 00:47:35.697
of how good somebody is today

1049
00:47:35.697 --> 00:47:38.501
until I see documentation.

1050
00:47:38.782 --> 00:47:41.088
Tiger Woods as great as he is in golf,

1051
00:47:41.088 --> 00:47:42.923
and he is really great and they're still sayin',

1052
00:47:42.923 --> 00:47:45.248
"It totally breaks Jack Nicklaus' all time

1053
00:47:45.248 --> 00:47:46.911
golf major record.

1054
00:47:46.911 --> 00:47:48.298
He's not the greatest."

1055
00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:50.815
And I'll say the same thing about these

1056
00:47:50.815 --> 00:47:52.821
modern day people today.

1057
00:47:52.821 --> 00:47:56.974
Show me 50 or a hundred

1058
00:47:56.974 --> 00:48:00.419
before and after, well documented,

1059
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:01.763
30 year protocol.

1060
00:48:01.763 --> 00:48:03.554
Make it even a one year protocol.

1061
00:48:03.554 --> 00:48:05.784
Really solid, Regina.

1062
00:48:05.784 --> 00:48:09.085
Then I will tell you that they are smart.

1063
00:48:09.085 --> 00:48:11.933
But if I'm just gonna go by somebody's title,

1064
00:48:11.933 --> 00:48:14.331
I have been against that all the time,

1065
00:48:14.331 --> 00:48:17.330
because it's not the title, it's the results

1066
00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.591
that interest me.

1067
00:48:19.591 --> 00:48:22.323
I was a track runner, I was an all American,

1068
00:48:22.323 --> 00:48:24.437
I hate to have thrown that in,

1069
00:48:24.437 --> 00:48:26.022
but in my event in the hundred meters--

1070
00:48:26.022 --> 00:48:27.065
<v ->Oh, go ahead. (laughs)</v>

1071
00:48:27.065 --> 00:48:28.042
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1072
00:48:28.042 --> 00:48:29.460
You got in your blocks,

1073
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.028
people talked all they wanted before the gun went off.

1074
00:48:33.028 --> 00:48:35.460
The gun went off, you ran in your lane,

1075
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.306
and you crossed the finish line.

1076
00:48:37.306 --> 00:48:39.684
Then you knew who does what,

1077
00:48:39.684 --> 00:48:41.631
and who ran what time.

1078
00:48:41.631 --> 00:48:42.416
<v ->Right.</v>

1079
00:48:42.416 --> 00:48:46.084
<v ->All we have now is a bunch of talk and hearsay,</v>

1080
00:48:46.084 --> 00:48:47.524
and most of these people will go,

1081
00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:50.978
"Well we cured 30 AIDS patients in Africa

1082
00:48:50.978 --> 00:48:52.371
with our machine."

1083
00:48:52.371 --> 00:48:55.742
And Aunt Mary at work, and this person has this,

1084
00:48:55.742 --> 00:48:58.680
show me the paperwork,

1085
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.593
then I will be impressed.

1086
00:49:00.593 --> 00:49:02.068
<v ->And they're not producing paperwork?</v>

1087
00:49:02.068 --> 00:49:03.327
<v ->Never.</v>

1088
00:49:03.327 --> 00:49:06.506
Not the before and after that I mentioned to you

1089
00:49:06.506 --> 00:49:07.883
because

1090
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:11.537
I can tell you that we might be better results from people

1091
00:49:11.537 --> 00:49:13.425
being meditators,

1092
00:49:13.425 --> 00:49:16.254
and changing the music they listen to,

1093
00:49:16.254 --> 00:49:19.892
and leaving their spouse or quitting their job,

1094
00:49:19.892 --> 00:49:22.548
if they did it at the same time they're using the machine,

1095
00:49:22.548 --> 00:49:24.745
you tell me what you think might've done it.

1096
00:49:24.745 --> 00:49:26.654
<v ->Right, it gets muddled in that case.</v>

1097
00:49:26.654 --> 00:49:28.007
<v ->It does.
<v ->Definitely.</v>

1098
00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:29.546
<v ->And that is what we're seeing here.</v>

1099
00:49:29.546 --> 00:49:31.945
Nobody to my knowledge with any of these machines,

1100
00:49:31.945 --> 00:49:33.834
and I see them all the time,

1101
00:49:33.834 --> 00:49:36.868
really has that kind of documentation.

1102
00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:41.005
<v ->Because we have new strains of superbugs,</v>

1103
00:49:41.005 --> 00:49:43.383
it seems to me like it would be an ideal time for the

1104
00:49:43.383 --> 00:49:45.764
Ergonomic 400,

1105
00:49:48.271 --> 00:49:49.759
Ergonom, not Ergonomic.

1106
00:49:49.759 --> 00:49:51.400
The Ergonom 400

1107
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.035
to make a resurgence.

1108
00:49:53.035 --> 00:49:56.129
We really need to be able to see what's going on, don't we?

1109
00:49:56.129 --> 00:49:57.686
<v ->Here's the difficulty.</v>

1110
00:49:57.686 --> 00:49:59.562
The Rife microscope,

1111
00:49:59.562 --> 00:50:01.525
the specimens

1112
00:50:01.525 --> 00:50:04.805
were illumined with a color.

1113
00:50:04.805 --> 00:50:06.410
<v ->That's true.</v>

1114
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.138
That was part of what he was--

1115
00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:11.260
<v ->And you could almost work backwards because</v>

1116
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.501
let's say that we can see with enhanced magnification

1117
00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:17.420
with the Ergonom 400.

1118
00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.430
We still may not know what we're looking at,

1119
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.907
and that doesn't mean that they're necessarily able to get

1120
00:50:22.907 --> 00:50:27.237
in the ballpark of what it would take to devitalize them.

1121
00:50:27.237 --> 00:50:30.262
Maybe they could look for a hundred years

1122
00:50:30.262 --> 00:50:34.181
at different frequencies, that was the beauty of Rife.

1123
00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:36.608
Is we're right narrowed in a particular frequency

1124
00:50:36.608 --> 00:50:38.758
because of that color.

1125
00:50:39.467 --> 00:50:42.572
<v ->Well, it can't simply be lost forever.</v>

1126
00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.412
There has to be a way.
<v ->As long as there are</v>

1127
00:50:44.412 --> 00:50:47.541
diligent, wonderful people like you,

1128
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:49.479
who will continue to tell the stories,

1129
00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:50.568
(chuckling)

1130
00:50:50.568 --> 00:50:52.184
then it's never gonna be lost.

1131
00:50:52.184 --> 00:50:54.296
<v ->Then there might be someone out there like Rife,</v>

1132
00:50:54.296 --> 00:50:55.931
ready to take this one up again.

1133
00:50:55.931 --> 00:50:59.016
<v ->Or there may be somebody out there, I've often said,</v>

1134
00:50:59.016 --> 00:51:00.949
the problem in medicine

1135
00:51:00.949 --> 00:51:05.322
is nobody in a truly opulent position

1136
00:51:05.322 --> 00:51:07.050
financially,

1137
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.591
has stepped up to the plate

1138
00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:13.068
and said, let's go,

1139
00:51:13.068 --> 00:51:16.210
and let's work in this energy medicine area.

1140
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:18.347
This electromagnetic.

1141
00:51:18.347 --> 00:51:21.635
And really do a Pepsi Challenge

1142
00:51:21.635 --> 00:51:25.832
and see what we have

1143
00:51:25.832 --> 00:51:29.844
and compare with what is being used now.

1144
00:51:29.844 --> 00:51:31.807
When somebody really does that,

1145
00:51:31.807 --> 00:51:33.422
I'm gonna throw in some words,

1146
00:51:33.422 --> 00:51:34.754
I'm assuming we can.

1147
00:51:34.754 --> 00:51:36.436
When you get these people who've set up these

1148
00:51:36.436 --> 00:51:39.368
super funds of money,

1149
00:51:39.646 --> 00:51:43.767
the 20 or 40 billion dollars.

1150
00:51:44.594 --> 00:51:45.746
There is a big difference.

1151
00:51:45.746 --> 00:51:47.335
Somebody once came to me and said,

1152
00:51:47.335 --> 00:51:49.329
"You know Steve, I'm a little upset because I've been

1153
00:51:49.329 --> 00:51:52.497
solicited by the this society, and the that society,

1154
00:51:52.497 --> 00:51:54.043
and this non-profit,"

1155
00:51:54.043 --> 00:51:56.016
asking for money.

1156
00:51:56.016 --> 00:51:57.212
And I said to them,

1157
00:51:57.212 --> 00:51:59.648
here's the difference.

1158
00:51:59.648 --> 00:52:03.838
Those societies continue to say that they are going to look

1159
00:52:03.838 --> 00:52:06.203
and try to find the answer,

1160
00:52:06.203 --> 00:52:09.100
and I have said when somebody in an opulent position

1161
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.053
comes to us,

1162
00:52:11.053 --> 00:52:13.473
we're not gonna tell them we're taking the money

1163
00:52:13.473 --> 00:52:14.902
to find an answer.

1164
00:52:14.902 --> 00:52:16.770
We already have the answers.

1165
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.959
We're looking for the revenue to proliferate

1166
00:52:19.959 --> 00:52:21.652
what already exists

1167
00:52:21.652 --> 00:52:23.676
into mainstream medicine,

1168
00:52:23.676 --> 00:52:25.734
past the vested interests,

1169
00:52:25.734 --> 00:52:27.235
past the greed,

1170
00:52:27.235 --> 00:52:29.329
past the closed-mindedness,

1171
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:31.099
and then there'll be a change.

1172
00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:34.111
The answer is not around the corner, Regina.

1173
00:52:34.111 --> 00:52:37.234
The answer is right here in front of us.

1174
00:52:39.117 --> 00:52:42.327
<v ->A resurgence of bioresonance therapies is in full bloom</v>

1175
00:52:42.327 --> 00:52:44.354
with devices popping up everywhere.

1176
00:52:44.354 --> 00:52:45.399
In the end,

1177
00:52:45.399 --> 00:52:48.034
it has long been known that electromagnetic frequencies

1178
00:52:48.034 --> 00:52:50.464
can correct physiological imbalances.

1179
00:52:50.464 --> 00:52:52.067
There are many paths to that end

1180
00:52:52.067 --> 00:52:53.614
and we will be watching closely

1181
00:52:53.614 --> 00:52:55.734
as this technology progresses.

1182
00:52:55.734 --> 00:52:57.536
Meanwhile, the World Research Foundation

1183
00:52:57.536 --> 00:53:00.384
is a treasure of information on healing modalities.

1184
00:53:00.384 --> 00:53:02.674
From alchemical remedies in the Dark Ages

1185
00:53:02.674 --> 00:53:05.159
to the most advanced technologies today.

Visit the website by clicking on the link below.

1187
00:53:07.782 --> 00:53:10.636
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1188
00:53:12.457 --> 00:53:16.461
(soothing music)
