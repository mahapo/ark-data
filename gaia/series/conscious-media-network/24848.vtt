00:00:00.565 --> 00:00:02.111
<v ->The subject of the Holy Grail</v>

2
00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:05.460
has been hotly debated and contested for hundreds of years.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.894
Popularized by Indiana Jones' adventurous quest,

4
00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.454
the grail is thought to be anything from a chalice

5
00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.526
to an ethereal substance called the philosopher's stone,

6
00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:15.828
to a spear.

7
00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:17.898
But what if it's something much more personal

8
00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:20.192
and within the grasp of each one of us?

9
00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:22.834
Mark Pinkham is the North American Grand Prior

10
00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.597
of the International Order of the Gnostic Templars.

11
00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:27.988
He has joined with the famed Sinclair family

12
00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:30.501
to bring the true essence of the Templar's mission

13
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:32.569
back to public consciousness.

14
00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:33.892
Mark says the Templar path

15
00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.100
was obscured a couple centuries ago

16
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.707
when money mixed with their agenda.

17
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:49.348
The whole subject of the Knight Templar

18
00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.791
is very confusing to an awful lot of people,

19
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.550
and to most people, it's been non-existent

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.477
until they read either The Da Vinci Code

21
00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:57.368
or one of the other books that have come along,

22
00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:59.425
some of the authors we know about.

23
00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.814
And really, you've made this your life's work,

24
00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:04.992
but there has to be a history, personally for you,

25
00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.809
to have jumped onto this path.

26
00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:09.978
That doesn't just happen to everyone.

27
00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:12.091
Would you mind telling us your personal story

28
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.346
and the lineage as to how you ended up in this position?

29
00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:16.546
<v ->Sure.</v>

30
00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:20.074
Well, as you know, I'm a writer, and some years ago

31
00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:23.844
I got the inspiration to write about the Knights Templars.

32
00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.654
I didn't know where it was all gonna lead,

33
00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:29.876
but I figured that I'd start off by interviewing

34
00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:32.713
some Knight Templars,

35
00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:37.100
and I was drawn to a man named Ian Sinclair.

36
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.940
He's part of Clan Sinclair.

37
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.585
They built Rosslyn Chapel, and so there was

38
00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:43.865
something very valuable there for me.

39
00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.518
I knew I had to talk to this guy.

40
00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:47.809
<v Voiceover>That even ends up in Dan Brown's work.</v>

41
00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:49.291
<v ->Exactly, right.</v>

42
00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:52.926
<v Voiceover>As a pop figure, he's there.</v>

43
00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:54.798
<v ->Definitely, definitely.</v>

44
00:01:55.358 --> 00:01:58.185
Anyway, I started talking to him on the phone,

45
00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.014
interviewing him, and we hit it off

46
00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:03.523
like long-lost brothers, virtually.

47
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.359
Talked forever, and my wife still would like to kill me

48
00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.616
because of our phone bill for that month. (both laugh)

49
00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:10.629
<v Voiceover>There was a resonance?</v>

50
00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.231
<v ->There was a major resonance, exactly.</v>

51
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:16.049
Well, at the time, he was one of the bigwigs

52
00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.647
of Militi Templi Scotia,

53
00:02:17.647 --> 00:02:21.230
which was the main Knight Templar organization in Scotland.

54
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.122
Well, soon after I did the interview with him,

55
00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:29.127
that organization just gradually dissolved, fell apart.

56
00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:32.205
That was a big surprise.

57
00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.542
I mean, it had been going very strong

58
00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:37.456
for, you know, a couple hundred years.

59
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.954
And so, the higher-ups went off

60
00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:44.382
and they created their own Templar organizations.

61
00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:46.543
Ian Sinclair went off,

62
00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.179
and he founded this Scottish Knight Templars.

63
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.352
There's two divisions in it.

64
00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:53.162
There is the more conservative,

65
00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:57.668
that's more a reflection of the kind of Templar orders

66
00:02:57.668 --> 00:02:59.492
that are out there today,

67
00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:01.481
and then there's ours, which is more mystical.

68
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.825
<v Voiceover>Yes, the Gnostic.</v>

69
00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.169
<v ->It's the Gnostic,</v>

70
00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.829
and we believe, as do the Sinclairs,

71
00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:12.102
that the Templars were very much connected

72
00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:16.475
to a Gnostic mystical tradition

73
00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:21.049
that they learned and then they inherited in the Holy Land

74
00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.646
and brought with them back into Europe.

75
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.945
For much the time that the Templars were around,

76
00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:30.012
it would've been part of the Templar tradition,

77
00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:33.489
a very, very important part, but a lot of it has been lost.

78
00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.953
Ian decided, and I decided,

79
00:03:36.953 --> 00:03:39.043
we decided together that we were going to revive

80
00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:41.304
that ancient tradition.

81
00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:45.571
<v Voiceover>You hear often about the great rituals</v>

82
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:48.312
and stuff that happen when you're being

83
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:50.179
initiated into the order.

84
00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.781
And some of this has appeared in some pop literature.

85
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.066
Some of it, when you start digging,

86
00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.326
you look at Tony Bushby's work

87
00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:57.649
and some of the other amazing writers

88
00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.040
that are out there but lesser known,

89
00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.930
you delve even deeper into that,

90
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.433
the whole notion of this ritual,

91
00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:06.343
which I've always been intrigued with

92
00:04:06.343 --> 00:04:07.975
for a variety of reasons,

93
00:04:07.975 --> 00:04:10.886
personal and also in the line as a journalist.

94
00:04:10.886 --> 00:04:13.200
Can you talk about some of that

95
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.075
in your own journey of becoming a Gnostic Templar,

96
00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:20.282
and some of what you had to pass through,

97
00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:23.274
the rites of passage that occurred after this?

98
00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:26.499
<v ->Well, let me say</v>

99
00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:31.058
that the Templars were famous for their heresy.

100
00:04:31.394 --> 00:04:34.344
It was because of thr heresy that was the downfall

101
00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:35.654
and dissolution of the order.

102
00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Voiceover>Give a little background on that.</v>

103
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.262
<v ->As we know it today,</v>

104
00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:42.414
after the Templars were initiated

105
00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:44.600
into these Gnostic traditions and these,

106
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.096
they brought them back into Europe

107
00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:49.165
and they started practicing the rites of these traditions

108
00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:51.184
in their preceptories.

109
00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:53.632
<v Voiceover>Give us the time frame on that, too.</v>

110
00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:58.437
<v ->Well, we're talking about 12th, 13th centuries, okay?</v>

111
00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:02.164
So of course, in Europe at that time,

112
00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:05.333
it was purely the Catholic tradition.

113
00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.768
So anything that wasn't Catholic was heresy.

114
00:05:08.768 --> 00:05:10.783
But this was really heresy. (laughs)

115
00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:13.001
<v Voiceover>Because it was pagan in its essence?</v>

116
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.499
<v ->Yeah, this really pushed the envelope, absolutely.</v>

117
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.859
Our order was infiltrated by King Phillip IV

118
00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:24.675
and Pope Clement V at the time.

119
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:25.753
They found what they were looking for.

120
00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:28.086
They knew we were heretics,

121
00:05:28.086 --> 00:05:29.771
but King Phillip wanted our money,

122
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:31.572
and this was a perfect way of bringing us down

123
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:33.600
so he could take our money.

124
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.117
So we were involved with rites that involved

125
00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:41.426
transmitting what we called the Holy Grail Energy,

126
00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:46.351
which is also known around the world as the Holy Spirit,

127
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:50.072
as the Serpent Power of Kundalini in the East.

128
00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:51.309
<v Voiceover>Or Kabal?</v>

129
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.497
<v ->Yes.</v>

130
00:05:52.882 --> 00:05:55.601
<v Voiceover>Yes, these energy extension selves, yes.</v>

131
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:58.875
<v ->Exactly, once that energy enters you,</v>

132
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:00.988
then it does the work of evolving you

133
00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:03.484
and opening up what we call the centers of Gnosis,

134
00:06:03.484 --> 00:06:05.766
the centers of intuitive wisdom.

135
00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.514
When that happens,

136
00:06:07.514 --> 00:06:10.425
so many answers to questions that you've always had

137
00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:11.974
are right there.

138
00:06:11.974 --> 00:06:13.436
What am I doing here?

139
00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:14.588
What's this universe about?

140
00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:15.686
Who am I?

141
00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:18.453
All those answers just bubble up within you.

142
00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:22.341
Our initiation ceremonies,

143
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.133
during that time period when we were in Europe,

144
00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.259
were to transmit that power from one,

145
00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.587
well, the Grand Master or a high-ranking Templar,

146
00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:31.971
to a new initiate.

147
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:33.145
There was different ways of doing it.

148
00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:34.809
One of the main ways was

149
00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.700
via the breath of the Templar Master.

150
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.893
There was the kiss.

151
00:06:38.893 --> 00:06:42.242
He would actually plant his lips on the initiate.

152
00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:43.363
<v Voiceover>It wasn't a love affair thing.</v>

153
00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:45.393
<v ->It wasn't a love affair, no.</v>

154
00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:49.434
At least not that kind that we think of it,

155
00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:51.351
but there was a transmission of that power

156
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.037
through his breath,

157
00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:56.225
which is actually a very common practice in the East,

158
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:58.690
but not in the West, obviously.

159
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.298
Then there was the kissing

160
00:07:01.298 --> 00:07:03.974
at certain strategic points on the body,

161
00:07:03.974 --> 00:07:06.513
below the navel, at the base of the spine,

162
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:09.829
those are seats of this energy in the East of Kundalini.

163
00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:12.154
That's another traditional way of awakening

164
00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:14.287
that energy in somebody.

165
00:07:14.287 --> 00:07:17.658
And so, these rites had to happen

166
00:07:17.658 --> 00:07:22.532
in order to begin the Gnostic path for the new initiate

167
00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:24.909
so that he could open up to that knowledge

168
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:26.385
and that wisdom.

169
00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:28.803
It was this power that we came to know of

170
00:07:28.803 --> 00:07:30.176
as the true Holy Grail.

171
00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:33.205
It was this power that we were the guardians of,

172
00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:36.640
and it was this power that we actually symbolized as a cup

173
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.434
although it wasn't the cup.

174
00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:43.138
If there is a Holy Grail that's a cup,

175
00:07:43.138 --> 00:07:46.645
it's a Holy Grail because it has this power attached to it.

176
00:07:46.645 --> 00:07:47.840
That's why it's a Holy Grail.

177
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.198
There's been many, many Holy Grails throughout history.

178
00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:51.541
<v Voiceover>And this is something we'll get to</v>

179
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:54.603
a little bit further on as we go through the history a bit

180
00:07:54.603 --> 00:07:56.127
about the whole notion of the Holy Grail.

181
00:07:56.127 --> 00:07:58.815
That's kind of where we have to end up on this story, right?

182
00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:00.198
(laughs)
<v ->Of course.</v>

183
00:08:00.198 --> 00:08:01.382
<v Voiceover>Of course.</v>

184
00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.748
You went through the rituals, I assume.

185
00:08:05.748 --> 00:08:07.155
You had to go through a ritual,

186
00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:11.475
and you became initiated into this order at what point?

187
00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.137
<v ->I can't tell you the whole ritutual.</v>

188
00:08:14.137 --> 00:08:14.936
<v Voiceover>No, I understand.</v>

189
00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:18.931
<v ->Because the main transmission for me,</v>

190
00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.573
to become a Grand Prior,

191
00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:23.261
was the ceremony of becoming a Grand Prior

192
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:26.439
which only myself and my international Grand Prior

193
00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.236
know anything about, and can only speak about.

194
00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:31.198
But there was a transmission of energy

195
00:08:31.198 --> 00:08:34.881
that came through that particular ceremony.

196
00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:37.825
The other ceremonies

197
00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:43.345
were similar to traditional Templar rituals

198
00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:45.521
like the knighting of the sword,

199
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:49.955
but there were some Gnostic goddess elements

200
00:08:49.955 --> 00:08:52.564
that were also involved, as well.

201
00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:55.171
There were some meditations.

202
00:08:55.689 --> 00:09:00.689
There was some transmissions that occurred, certainly.

203
00:09:01.213 --> 00:09:03.698
But for me, in my experience,

204
00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:05.789
the real transmission seemed to happen during that time

205
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:07.453
when I did become the Grand Prior,

206
00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:11.656
and it seemed like that there was an energy

207
00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.063
or is an energy that's passed

208
00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:15.111
from one Grand Prior to the next.

209
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:18.236
That's how we know the Templars,

210
00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:19.579
is that there was an energy that passed

211
00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:23.477
with Grand Prior, or one Grand Master to the next

212
00:09:23.477 --> 00:09:25.122
who became the head of the order

213
00:09:25.122 --> 00:09:28.090
and became the fountainhead of that energy.

214
00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:30.442
<v Voiceover>It's important to point out at this point,</v>

215
00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:32.618
and you made an allusion to it a moment ago,

216
00:09:32.618 --> 00:09:35.668
that in the Gnostic Templar order,

217
00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:39.647
this is really viewed holistically

218
00:09:39.647 --> 00:09:43.310
going back into some of the original

219
00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:47.056
archetypes and such that included the goddess.

220
00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:50.307
This isn't just a patriarchal

221
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.752
type of organization in this sense.

222
00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:55.436
In fact, there are even women in the order, are there not?

223
00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:57.716
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

224
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.387
We are part of a Gnostic lineage

225
00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:06.676
that was passed to us.

226
00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:09.380
And this Gnostic lineage, if you take it back far enough,

227
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.854
begins with the goddess tradition.

228
00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:13.028
It comes out of the goddess tradition.

229
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.632
All Gnostic traditions come out the goddess tradition

230
00:10:15.632 --> 00:10:18.085
because Gnosis, or Gnosticism

231
00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.687
is about going off and finding your own truth

232
00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:24.250
without anybody or anything telling you how it is.

233
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.669
<v Voiceover>Is it like an original knowing,</v>

234
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:26.927
or innate knowing?
<v Mark>Yes, it is.</v>

235
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:30.909
There's no need for any intermediary or priest

236
00:10:31.758 --> 00:10:34.051
to connect you with the higher source.

237
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:35.065
You're right there.

238
00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:36.950
It's a constant communion.

239
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.553
Now if you study up the goddess tradition throughout time,

240
00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:40.660
that's the way it's always, go off

241
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.504
and have your own experience.

242
00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:46.250
Feel it, be with it, unite with it.

243
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:50.159
That's what we try to do.

244
00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:51.396
That's the kind of experience we try to give

245
00:10:51.396 --> 00:10:53.209
within our organization.

246
00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:55.405
But according to tradition,

247
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:58.817
our first Grand Master, Hugues de Payens,

248
00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:01.505
right after we were formed in 1118 AD,

249
00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:03.384
he was initiated into what they called

250
00:11:03.384 --> 00:11:05.240
this Johannite lineage,

251
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.555
also known as the Holy Grail lineage,

252
00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:11.938
that came through Jesus, Mary Magdalene,

253
00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:13.238
John the Apostle.

254
00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:16.960
Ultimately, it started way back in the East, the Far East,

255
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.623
and came West with the tribe known as the Mandaean people,

256
00:11:21.623 --> 00:11:25.003
and they're the only surviving Gnostic sect

257
00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:26.295
from ancient time that still exists.

258
00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:28.661
They exist in southern Iraq.

259
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:29.846
They came West,

260
00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:32.201
and they united with the Persian civilization,

261
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:35.188
Egyptian civilization, Sumerian.

262
00:11:35.188 --> 00:11:37.842
Finally, they merge with the Essenes.

263
00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:40.904
And within the Essenes, they became a branch

264
00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:44.717
of Essenes known as the Nasareans, or the Nazarenes.

265
00:11:44.717 --> 00:11:47.138
I'm sure you've heard that word,

266
00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:49.047
but in truth, if you study the Gnostic gospels,

267
00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:52.075
it means "he of Gnostic wisdom."

268
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:53.269
That means something totally different

269
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:56.056
than what we commonly know of it.

270
00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:01.639
Within that sect of the Nazarenes

271
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:06.156
was born John the Baptist, Jesus, John the Apostle.

272
00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:09.682
John the Baptist became the first Grand Master

273
00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:11.059
of this lineage in the West,

274
00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:13.471
so he's the founder of the Gnostic lineage in the West.

275
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:15.741
He passed the Grand Mastership to Jesus.

276
00:12:15.741 --> 00:12:18.364
This was during the baptism on the river Jordan.

277
00:12:18.364 --> 00:12:22.115
Jesus passed it to Mary Magdalene and John the Apostle.

278
00:12:22.628 --> 00:12:24.951
It's said that that happened on the cross.

279
00:12:24.951 --> 00:12:28.466
They were the only two apostles at the foot of the cross.

280
00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:30.620
After that time, it passed down the lineage

281
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.145
of many Grand Masters.

282
00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:33.361
They were all named John,

283
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:35.142
because John was never meant to be a name.

284
00:12:35.142 --> 00:12:37.228
It was actually a title meaning,

285
00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:39.748
"he of Gnostic power and wisdom."

286
00:12:41.316 --> 00:12:44.322
After the first crusade,

287
00:12:44.766 --> 00:12:46.569
our first Grand Master, Hugues de Payens,

288
00:12:46.569 --> 00:12:47.784
got initiated in that order

289
00:12:47.784 --> 00:12:49.309
and he became the Grand Master of it.

290
00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:52.806
So essentially we adopted it, or we inherited it,

291
00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:54.838
and it became one with us.

292
00:12:56.912 --> 00:12:59.366
How we look at it is that Jesus really, essentially,

293
00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:01.657
created two lineages.

294
00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:04.836
The more fundamentalist, the more patriarchal,

295
00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:07.214
the Catholic lineage with St. Peter,

296
00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:09.838
the more matriarchal, the Gnostic,

297
00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:13.421
the alchemical with John the Apostle and Mary Magdalene.

298
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:16.109
We are the representatives of that lineage,

299
00:13:16.109 --> 00:13:20.946
and it's that lineage that we are trying now to revive.

300
00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:23.586
It was always part of us,

301
00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:25.655
and then, when the secret societies were formed

302
00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:27.447
that split off from us,

303
00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:29.046
they became representatives of it as well.

304
00:13:29.046 --> 00:13:32.218
They were all alchemists, they were all Gnostics.

305
00:13:32.683 --> 00:13:36.611
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's where I wanted to see if we can...</v>

306
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:38.357
Now this is going to become a little tangential,

307
00:13:38.357 --> 00:13:39.945
but it's hard not to with this story,

308
00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:41.726
(laughs)
and that is the whole notion

309
00:13:41.726 --> 00:13:45.144
of the Knight Templar and the word "Illuminati."

310
00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:47.447
Can you talk about that?

311
00:13:48.051 --> 00:13:49.469
<v ->I'm used to talking about it,</v>

312
00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:50.427
as you can probably imagine.

313
00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Voiceover>Yeah, if you would share.</v>

314
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.201
<v ->The Illuminati started off as a Gnostic</v>

315
00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:58.825
tradition, a Gnostic sect.

316
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:00.975
The original Grand Masters,

317
00:14:00.975 --> 00:14:04.818
they sat around a five-pointed star of the goddess.

318
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.949
They wanted everyone to have a Gnostic experience,

319
00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:09.634
and the way they were going to do that

320
00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:12.422
is by bringing down all authority on the planet.

321
00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:14.318
Anybody or anything that's telling you

322
00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:15.778
what to do or what to think,

323
00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.143
they were gonna bring it down.

324
00:14:17.143 --> 00:14:20.960
All monarchies, the church, everything.

325
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.847
<v Voiceover>So, all heretics by nature,</v>

326
00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:24.864
yeah, by virtue of what they're doing.

327
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.794
<v ->They were essentially carrying on our work,</v>

328
00:14:27.794 --> 00:14:29.288
and they were also getting vengance for us

329
00:14:29.288 --> 00:14:31.207
because it was the church and the monarchy

330
00:14:31.207 --> 00:14:33.058
that brought us down.

331
00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:37.297
Anyway, that was their goal.

332
00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:40.263
In the end, it turned out to be something quite different.

333
00:14:40.263 --> 00:14:43.905
The new world order was gonna essentially be no order.

334
00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:46.176
<v Voiceover>Right, and that's where I wanted to go</v>

335
00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:50.340
from here, because this is linked together.

336
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.147
I mean, there's a direct link here between the Templars,

337
00:14:54.147 --> 00:14:56.111
the Illuminati, and the new world order,

338
00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:59.298
and I wanna know how you perceive that.

339
00:15:00.197 --> 00:15:03.801
<v ->Like I said, it's not how it was originally envisioned.</v>

340
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:07.851
What happened was that the Jews had been

341
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:10.255
disenfranchised at the time of the Illuminati.

342
00:15:10.255 --> 00:15:12.481
They couldn't become Freemasons.

343
00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:15.615
Now, there was a big conference

344
00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:17.427
where the Illuminati and Freemasons

345
00:15:17.427 --> 00:15:20.829
came together as one grand organization.

346
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:25.525
This was, like, in Wilhelmbad in Germany in 1782,

347
00:15:26.235 --> 00:15:27.618
And at that time, it was decided,

348
00:15:27.618 --> 00:15:30.667
well, the Jews can also be a part of that organization.

349
00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:33.435
They were excluded before, but now they could be.

350
00:15:33.435 --> 00:15:36.139
Soon after that happened, then the Jews,

351
00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:37.910
who are becoming the world bankers,

352
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.861
the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers,

353
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:41.280
they wanted to get on the bandwagon.

354
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.941
They were just right up the road in Frankfurt,

355
00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.869
and they said, "Well that sounds good.

356
00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:46.638
"Let us be a part of this.

357
00:15:47.272 --> 00:15:48.520
"We know you're gonna need us

358
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.920
"because you want to start these world revolutions

359
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.480
"and bring down monarchies,

360
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.654
"the French Revolution and so forth,

361
00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:55.953
"you're going to need our money."

362
00:15:55.953 --> 00:15:57.344
<v Voiceover>Interestingly, the Templars had</v>

363
00:15:57.344 --> 00:15:59.019
a history as the first bankers.

364
00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:00.167
<v ->That's true, yeah.</v>

365
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.349
<v Voiceover>Okay go ahead, yes.</v>

366
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.014
<v ->So the Jews had their own agenda,</v>

367
00:16:06.014 --> 00:16:09.642
which was different than the original Illuminati agenda.

368
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:13.442
The Jews felt totally disenfranchised

369
00:16:13.442 --> 00:16:15.997
from the very beginning, and they were Zionists.

370
00:16:15.997 --> 00:16:18.549
They believed, virtually,

371
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:20.949
that they should be ruling the world.

372
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:23.669
There was a faction of Jews that were Zionists

373
00:16:23.669 --> 00:16:25.046
that believed this,

374
00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:27.754
that God had given them the world to rule over.

375
00:16:27.754 --> 00:16:28.831
<v Voiceover>As the chosen people.</v>

376
00:16:28.831 --> 00:16:31.114
<v ->Yeah, as the chosen people.</v>

377
00:16:31.114 --> 00:16:34.775
And so that's what happened, is that gradually,

378
00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:38.835
the Illuminati became infiltrated by the Jewish bankers,

379
00:16:38.835 --> 00:16:41.736
and it was really the agenda of he Jewish bankers

380
00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.453
that took over the Illuminati

381
00:16:43.453 --> 00:16:45.076
and took it in another direction.

382
00:16:45.076 --> 00:16:47.320
And that's the way it is today.

383
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.100
They became, basically, the rulers of the world

384
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.429
which they are, in essence.

385
00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:55.921
<v Voiceover>Right, he who controls the coffers, right.</v>

386
00:16:55.921 --> 00:16:59.948
So with that split, then what happened to the others

387
00:16:59.948 --> 00:17:03.457
who had been carrying the original intent?

388
00:17:03.457 --> 00:17:06.989
Is that what's being revived now?

389
00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:10.219
<v ->Those that carry the original Tem-</v>

390
00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:12.369
They basically went off and became a part

391
00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.385
of other secret societies,

392
00:17:14.385 --> 00:17:15.761
or they became part of Freemasonry,

393
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:17.649
or they became a part of Rosicrucianism.

394
00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:19.806
There were many other secret societies

395
00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.356
that continue to be Gnostics and alchemists.

396
00:17:22.356 --> 00:17:25.615
So they essentially went off and became one of them.

397
00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:27.279
That's all.

398
00:17:28.727 --> 00:17:31.530
Certainly there were some that continued

399
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.847
within in the Illuminati for some time,

400
00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:37.002
and still thought that they were going to be able

401
00:17:37.002 --> 00:17:38.912
to realize their original agenda,

402
00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:41.887
which eventually they find out that wasn't gonna happen.

403
00:17:43.547 --> 00:17:45.071
<v Voiceover>Which, rather than take down the structures</v>

404
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:46.467
would be to control the structures.

405
00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:48.802
<v ->Right, I mean the membership</v>

406
00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:52.068
and the agenda today is

407
00:17:52.068 --> 00:17:54.510
100% different than what it was.

408
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.110
<v Voiceover>I see what you're saying, yeah.</v>

409
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.087
<v ->It's totally different.</v>

410
00:17:59.832 --> 00:18:01.741
Anyway, they split off,

411
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:05.991
and they became the new Templars or the Rosicrucians.

412
00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:11.339
Basically, all the secret societies,

413
00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:14.923
the ones that were the alchemists and the Gnostics,

414
00:18:14.923 --> 00:18:18.703
they were all united under the symbol of the rose,

415
00:18:19.552 --> 00:18:21.481
and you've heard the term "sub rosa."

416
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:22.238
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

417
00:18:22.238 --> 00:18:23.432
<v ->"Under the rose,"</v>

418
00:18:23.432 --> 00:18:26.144
because the rose is the symbol of the goddess.

419
00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:29.411
It's often represented with five petals.

420
00:18:29.411 --> 00:18:31.413
Five is the number of the goddess,

421
00:18:31.413 --> 00:18:33.345
and it's a red rose because red rose

422
00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:35.712
is a symbol of Gnosis and alchemy.

423
00:18:36.347 --> 00:18:41.167
The red in the rose represents the fire of alchemy,

424
00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:44.601
and the opening of it represents the opening of gnosis.

425
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:47.396
It comes through that fire, so it's the red rose.

426
00:18:48.196 --> 00:18:51.622
The wisdom that was taught by the secret society sub rosa

427
00:18:51.622 --> 00:18:55.033
was the secrets of alchemy and Gnosis.

428
00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:58.402
It was the secrets of alchemy

429
00:18:58.402 --> 00:19:00.332
that these secret societies protected.

430
00:19:00.332 --> 00:19:02.370
It wasn't necessarily blood line,

431
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.419
altough that might have been part of the secrets,

432
00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:06.711
but their main secret was alchemy.

433
00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:08.188
Because if you looking through history,

434
00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:09.556
they were all alchemists.

435
00:19:09.556 --> 00:19:11.134
All of them were.

436
00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:12.379
<v Voiceover>This is an important facet</v>

437
00:19:12.379 --> 00:19:15.280
that often is not known to the public at large

438
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.528
when you hear about the Knight Templar.

439
00:19:16.528 --> 00:19:18.331
We think it's, oh, a dozen or so guys

440
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:21.083
that helped protect some pilgrims (laughs)

441
00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:23.330
traveling to the Holy Land once upon a time,

442
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.609
and end of story, they all went bye-bye.

443
00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:28.933
<v ->Well initially, there was only a few,</v>

444
00:19:29.413 --> 00:19:31.551
and that's all they needed.

445
00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:33.544
Now, if they were going to protect the Holy Land,

446
00:19:33.544 --> 00:19:35.570
it would've taken a lot more, obviously.

447
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.162
They only needed nine knights.

448
00:19:37.162 --> 00:19:40.549
Why? Because their agenda at that time

449
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:45.312
was to retrieve some ancient manuscripts

450
00:19:45.312 --> 00:19:49.273
and treasures that had been buried by their ancestors.

451
00:19:49.878 --> 00:19:51.668
Their ancestors, that's an important one.

452
00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:53.164
This is their ancestors,

453
00:19:53.164 --> 00:19:57.877
because the time of the Roman takeover of Jerusalem,

454
00:19:57.877 --> 00:20:01.666
many of the elders amongst the Jews,

455
00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:03.490
they left, they fled.

456
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.674
They went into Europe,

457
00:20:04.674 --> 00:20:07.010
and they became a part of the royal families.

458
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.972
The Knights that become the Templars later on

459
00:20:08.972 --> 00:20:10.497
were descended from them.

460
00:20:10.497 --> 00:20:12.876
The secrets of where a lot of Jewish treasures

461
00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:16.214
were hid at that time passed down through these families.

462
00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.934
So when the Templars came in,

463
00:20:17.934 --> 00:20:19.556
they knew exactly where to go to dig

464
00:20:19.556 --> 00:20:22.489
to retrieve these documents and these treasures,

465
00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:24.109
and that's what they did.

466
00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:26.947
A lot of the digging happened under Solomon's Temple.

467
00:20:26.947 --> 00:20:29.058
They dug down 20 feet into bedrock.

468
00:20:29.058 --> 00:20:30.914
You don't do that unless you're darn sure--

469
00:20:30.914 --> 00:20:31.820
<v Voiceover>(chuckles) There's something there.</v>

470
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.252
<v ->You know there's something there, exactly right.</v>

471
00:20:34.258 --> 00:20:36.739
And they found it.

472
00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:41.570
So after nine years, they left with five huge cases.

473
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.139
This is the legend.

474
00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:46.011
They travelled up into Europe,

475
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:49.082
and those cases eventually ended up in Kilwinning,

476
00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:52.394
which was the first Freemasonic lodge in Scotland.

477
00:20:52.394 --> 00:20:53.430
They were there for some time.

478
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.829
And then they went to Rosslyn Castle

479
00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:57.801
and the sat there for a number of years.

480
00:20:57.801 --> 00:21:00.212
Rosslyn Castle was the home

481
00:21:00.212 --> 00:21:02.871
of the Sinclair earls of Rosslyn.

482
00:21:03.357 --> 00:21:05.330
Because the Sinclairs and the Templars

483
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.646
were totally interconnected since the very beginning,

484
00:21:07.646 --> 00:21:09.640
when Hugues de Payens, the first Grand Master,

485
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.485
married Catherine de St. Clair, so married

486
00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:14.476
into the St. Clair, or Sinclair, clan.

487
00:21:15.122 --> 00:21:17.395
Anyway, the boxes are in Rosslyn Chapel,

488
00:21:17.395 --> 00:21:19.751
Rosslyn Castle, excuse me, I'm jumping ahead of myself.

489
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:21.212
And there is a big fire.

490
00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:23.917
The first thing they take out of Rosslyn Castle

491
00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:25.573
is the boxes.

492
00:21:26.134 --> 00:21:28.191
And six months to the day almost after that,

493
00:21:28.191 --> 00:21:30.731
they start building Rosslyn Chapel,

494
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:33.653
right next to Rosslyn Castle.

495
00:21:33.653 --> 00:21:36.842
So it's believed that that might be the main reason

496
00:21:36.842 --> 00:21:39.018
that they built Rosslyn Chapel,

497
00:21:39.018 --> 00:21:40.372
was to hold those five boxes.

498
00:21:40.372 --> 00:21:42.549
<v Voiceover>And what is said to be in those boxes?</v>

499
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:45.641
<v ->Well, a lot of treasures from the Jewish elders,</v>

500
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:49.982
but also a lot of documentation that shows the connection

501
00:21:49.982 --> 00:21:52.883
between the Templars and that Johannite lineage

502
00:21:52.883 --> 00:21:56.621
that came from Jesus, Mary Magdelene, John the Apostle.

503
00:21:57.311 --> 00:22:00.680
Apparently, there is a lot of documentation,

504
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.601
documents and illustrations that are very heretical.

505
00:22:03.601 --> 00:22:07.676
One of them actually, today, is hanging up

506
00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:10.170
in the University of Ghent

507
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.326
library in Belgium.

508
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.469
Because this one was actually copied over.

509
00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:18.248
As the Templars were bringing those five trunks up

510
00:22:18.248 --> 00:22:20.136
through Europe, one of the documents

511
00:22:20.136 --> 00:22:22.315
was taken out and copied over.

512
00:22:23.995 --> 00:22:28.348
And today, it's in the University of Ghent library,

513
00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:30.725
and it's called The Heavenly Jerusalem.

514
00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:32.526
It's an illustration.

515
00:22:32.526 --> 00:22:34.968
And those that have studied it say,

516
00:22:34.968 --> 00:22:38.305
"Okay, well, The Heavenly Jerusalem is supposed to be

517
00:22:38.305 --> 00:22:40.025
"founded by the Messiah, that's what he's

518
00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:42.466
"gonna bring to this world, is the Heavenly Jerusalem."

519
00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:44.578
But if you study this particular illustration,

520
00:22:44.578 --> 00:22:46.124
well, Jesus is nowhere to be found.

521
00:22:46.124 --> 00:22:47.671
Now, where is Jesus?

522
00:22:47.671 --> 00:22:50.486
Well, apparently, what the document says,

523
00:22:50.486 --> 00:22:52.844
what the illustration says is, John the Baptist

524
00:22:52.844 --> 00:22:54.796
was the founder of the new Jerusalem,

525
00:22:54.796 --> 00:22:56.438
making him the Messiah.

526
00:22:56.438 --> 00:23:00.673
This is typical Johannite heretical wisdom

527
00:23:00.673 --> 00:23:03.647
that supposedly was passed down to the Templars, you see?

528
00:23:03.647 --> 00:23:06.271
So we believe, since we know that at least one document

529
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:10.483
has that heresy, that heretical information,

530
00:23:10.483 --> 00:23:13.141
that there's probably gonna be a number of others

531
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.441
that also do.
<v Voiceover>Might there be</v>

532
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:17.560
a reason to keep those hidden?

533
00:23:17.895 --> 00:23:19.201
<v ->Definitely.</v>

534
00:23:19.643 --> 00:23:21.670
Why? Well, there's a couple reasons,

535
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.460
one of which is that it can be very explosive

536
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.123
to get that information out there,

537
00:23:28.123 --> 00:23:30.003
as you can imagine, right?

538
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:32.378
Because these documents, one will say,

539
00:23:32.378 --> 00:23:36.037
"Jesus was one of many sons of God in this long lineage,

540
00:23:36.037 --> 00:23:37.336
"this Johannite lineage."
<v Voiceover>Many Messiahs,</v>

541
00:23:37.336 --> 00:23:38.062
yes.
<v Mark>Right.</v>

542
00:23:38.062 --> 00:23:40.825
Not just himself, but there were many.

543
00:23:40.825 --> 00:23:43.314
And that John was co-Messiah.

544
00:23:44.727 --> 00:23:47.874
Also, that the true lineage,

545
00:23:47.874 --> 00:23:49.963
and the most ancient lineage in the true lineage

546
00:23:49.963 --> 00:23:53.119
that Jesus received, passed on to John the Apostle

547
00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:55.369
and Mary Magdelene, not St. Peter.

548
00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:56.402
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

549
00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:57.842
<v ->And we're actually finding that in some</v>

550
00:23:57.842 --> 00:23:59.464
of the Gnostic gospels today.

551
00:23:59.464 --> 00:24:01.618
In the Pistis Sophia, for example,

552
00:24:01.618 --> 00:24:05.916
Jesus is quoted as saying about John and Mary

553
00:24:05.916 --> 00:24:08.359
that they will attain more than any of his other apostles,

554
00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:09.841
and they will receive more from him

555
00:24:09.841 --> 00:24:11.142
than any of the rest of them.

556
00:24:11.142 --> 00:24:12.401
It says right in the Pistis Sofia.

557
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:13.713
So you can find that information

558
00:24:13.713 --> 00:24:15.387
in the Gnostic gospels today.

559
00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:17.212
And as we know, in the Gospel of Phillip

560
00:24:17.212 --> 00:24:19.995
and the Gospel of Mary, it says Jesus loved Mary

561
00:24:19.995 --> 00:24:21.436
greater than all the rest of them.

562
00:24:21.436 --> 00:24:23.857
He taught her many things that he didn't teach

563
00:24:23.857 --> 00:24:25.002
the other apostles.

564
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.132
So it's right there.

565
00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.443
<v Voiceover>It's right there,</v>

566
00:24:28.443 --> 00:24:29.648
hiding in plain sight.

567
00:24:29.648 --> 00:24:30.597
<v ->It is.
<v Voiceover>But there are</v>

568
00:24:30.597 --> 00:24:31.738
vested interests in that, that that doesn't--

569
00:24:31.738 --> 00:24:34.546
<v ->Obviously, you know, there's a lot,</v>

570
00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:37.600
a lot of reasons why we'd want to keep that secret

571
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.172
and a lot of reasons why, you know,

572
00:24:40.172 --> 00:24:42.348
some people out there would like to destroy

573
00:24:43.018 --> 00:24:44.210
those documents.

574
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.471
<v Voiceover>So it's been well secreted away</v>

575
00:24:46.471 --> 00:24:48.135
and hidden for a very long time.

576
00:24:48.135 --> 00:24:49.803
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

577
00:24:50.386 --> 00:24:51.324
<v Voiceover>What about the Knight...</v>

578
00:24:51.324 --> 00:24:54.129
You gave a talk recently and I saw a little sheet

579
00:24:54.129 --> 00:24:56.603
that mentioned this, and it was talking about

580
00:24:56.603 --> 00:24:58.684
the Templars and the new world order,

581
00:24:58.684 --> 00:25:00.123
now making the link there.

582
00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.382
Can you make that?

583
00:25:01.382 --> 00:25:02.843
I mean, would you mind making that link

584
00:25:02.843 --> 00:25:03.805
or talking about that?

585
00:25:03.805 --> 00:25:05.375
<v ->Well, like I said,</v>

586
00:25:05.375 --> 00:25:08.012
the new world order, for us,

587
00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:12.544
is different than it is for the Jewish bankers.

588
00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:14.042
<v Voiceover>Right, I understand.</v>

589
00:25:14.042 --> 00:25:15.663
We understand that new world order.

590
00:25:15.663 --> 00:25:17.824
What is your new world order?

591
00:25:18.064 --> 00:25:20.713
<v ->My new world order is to</v>

592
00:25:22.735 --> 00:25:25.625
unite the religions, all the religions around the world,

593
00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:27.972
by showing their common links,

594
00:25:27.972 --> 00:25:31.995
and ultimately show that the foundation of all religion

595
00:25:31.995 --> 00:25:34.553
is the Gnostic alchemical path.

596
00:25:34.553 --> 00:25:37.984
Religion doesn't exist without the Gnostic alchemical path.

597
00:25:37.984 --> 00:25:42.453
All religions were founded by a Gnostic master

598
00:25:42.453 --> 00:25:44.533
who went out and had his experience, had his visions,

599
00:25:44.533 --> 00:25:46.667
received his wisdom, he came back,

600
00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:49.226
and he taught his disciples, they made a religion out of it.

601
00:25:49.226 --> 00:25:51.242
From that point on, anybody in the religion

602
00:25:51.242 --> 00:25:53.493
either had to have that same experience

603
00:25:53.493 --> 00:25:55.541
as that original Gnostic, or they couldn't have

604
00:25:55.541 --> 00:25:57.759
that experience because it was decided he's the one,

605
00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:00.053
only son of God, so you can't have that, one or the other.

606
00:26:00.053 --> 00:26:02.047
But either way, you're told what to believe

607
00:26:02.047 --> 00:26:04.654
and what vision you can have and can't have.

608
00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:07.326
But the foundation of all religion

609
00:26:07.326 --> 00:26:09.460
is that Gnostic alchemical path.

610
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.006
<v Voiceover>That makes total sense.</v>

611
00:26:11.006 --> 00:26:14.313
It's from a person's experience or inner wisdoms

612
00:26:14.313 --> 00:26:16.043
and knowledge, and others resonate with it

613
00:26:16.043 --> 00:26:18.770
and begin following, and therefore you have a religion.

614
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.758
<v ->Right.</v>

615
00:26:19.758 --> 00:26:20.963
<v Voiceover>Yeah, so in the purest sense,</v>

616
00:26:20.963 --> 00:26:22.200
that makes total sense.

617
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.291
<v ->Well, right now we are working with people</v>

618
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.914
called the Yazidis in northern Iraq.

619
00:26:28.678 --> 00:26:30.428
They claim they're oldest religion in the world.

620
00:26:30.428 --> 00:26:32.338
They came from the East, they came from India.

621
00:26:32.338 --> 00:26:34.411
We believe that originally, they came

622
00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:37.350
from a place much more ancient,

623
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.405
the ancient continent of Lemuria, some people call it.

624
00:26:41.723 --> 00:26:45.206
And their deity,

625
00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:46.625
their main deity is called

626
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:49.527
the Peacock Angel, and he was the founder

627
00:26:49.527 --> 00:26:52.172
of the Gnostic path, the Gnostic tradition.

628
00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:54.541
He brought the wisdom to this Earth.

629
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:57.492
He's also known in many other traditions

630
00:26:57.492 --> 00:26:59.949
around the world with many different names.

631
00:27:00.883 --> 00:27:01.823
<v Voiceover>Give us some of the names</v>

632
00:27:01.823 --> 00:27:03.359
we would recognize and some we wouldn't,

633
00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:05.064
just to see that this is,

634
00:27:05.514 --> 00:27:09.079
that all of these traditions have named that influence.

635
00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:12.102
<v ->Well, the Hindus know him as</v>

636
00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:16.353
Murugan, Skanda, Sanat Kumara, Karthigai,

637
00:27:16.353 --> 00:27:18.486
many different names for that one deity.

638
00:27:18.486 --> 00:27:20.683
The Muslims know him as Al-Khadir.

639
00:27:20.683 --> 00:27:22.923
We got to know him as St. George.

640
00:27:22.923 --> 00:27:24.832
He's also known amongst the pagans

641
00:27:24.832 --> 00:27:26.927
as the Green Man.

642
00:27:27.755 --> 00:27:30.604
He is Quetzlcoatl, the plumed serpent.

643
00:27:30.604 --> 00:27:32.102
<v Voiceover>In South American tradition.</v>

644
00:27:32.102 --> 00:27:35.678
<v ->Thoth Hermes, of the Egyptian tradition.</v>

645
00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:39.813
He's Melchizedek, he's Michael, he's Metatron,

646
00:27:39.813 --> 00:27:41.875
he's all these things.

647
00:27:42.617 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Voiceover>And what is the essence of this being?</v>

648
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.046
<v ->The essence of this being is Gnosis itself.</v>

649
00:27:48.046 --> 00:27:50.568
The Hindus refer to him as

650
00:27:51.704 --> 00:27:53.843
the Jna Pandita.

651
00:27:54.093 --> 00:27:57.703
"Jna" is the Hindu word, or Sanskrit word for Gnosis,

652
00:27:58.254 --> 00:28:00.642
the original teacher of Gnosis.

653
00:28:00.642 --> 00:28:02.912
But they also refer to him as that original

654
00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:05.944
power of Kundalini.

655
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.848
And so, he teaches

656
00:28:10.493 --> 00:28:13.896
by moving through you as the Kundalini

657
00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:15.889
and opening your centers of Gnosis.

658
00:28:15.889 --> 00:28:18.674
<v Voiceover>And Kundalini figures very greatly</v>

659
00:28:18.674 --> 00:28:20.636
into the Gnostic Templar tradition,

660
00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:22.311
the opening of the Kundalini's centers.

661
00:28:22.311 --> 00:28:23.326
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Voiceover>Which is the</v>

662
00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:24.806
opening to knowledge and light, right?

663
00:28:24.806 --> 00:28:26.107
Well, exactly.

664
00:28:26.107 --> 00:28:28.465
Anybody can have a Gnostic experience,

665
00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:30.310
whether that energy is awake or not.

666
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.849
But to be completely established in that wisdom,

667
00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:34.888
and to ultimately make that last step

668
00:28:34.888 --> 00:28:37.445
into super consciousness and to the infinite,

669
00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:39.003
that energy needs to be awakened,

670
00:28:39.003 --> 00:28:41.605
so your whole body, your whole beingness

671
00:28:41.605 --> 00:28:43.174
can go through the transportation it needs

672
00:28:43.174 --> 00:28:44.962
in order to raise your frequency,

673
00:28:44.962 --> 00:28:47.056
so you can have that experience.

674
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.180
So yeah, he's the Jna Pandita,

675
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.291
he's the original teacher of Gnosis.

676
00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:55.361
The Sufis knew him as Al-Khadir.

677
00:28:55.361 --> 00:28:57.296
They would say that,

678
00:28:58.007 --> 00:28:59.306
when a Sufi is ready to get initiated

679
00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:00.684
in his spiritual life, he'd show up

680
00:29:00.684 --> 00:29:03.767
and transform himself into them

681
00:29:04.273 --> 00:29:05.843
and do all the work of taking him

682
00:29:05.843 --> 00:29:07.734
to that higher frequency.

683
00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:13.233
Of course, as Thoth Hermes in that tradition,

684
00:29:13.233 --> 00:29:15.884
he was the original master of alchemy.

685
00:29:17.564 --> 00:29:19.689
As the Quetzlcoatl,

686
00:29:19.689 --> 00:29:23.533
he was the original divine master.

687
00:29:24.136 --> 00:29:26.566
So yeah, he's known all over the world.

688
00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:28.112
There's so much more that you can say about him.

689
00:29:28.112 --> 00:29:30.644
And I'm learning, daily, about him.

690
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.339
But he's also, one of the important things about him

691
00:29:33.339 --> 00:29:37.188
is, he's also known as the original son of the goddess.

692
00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:39.342
Now, before there was a tradition of the god

693
00:29:39.342 --> 00:29:41.755
and the son of god, there was a tradition

694
00:29:41.755 --> 00:29:44.046
of the goddess and the son of the goddess.

695
00:29:44.046 --> 00:29:46.041
And the goddess has had her mysteries,

696
00:29:46.041 --> 00:29:48.216
which were these Gnostic alchemical mysteries,

697
00:29:48.216 --> 00:29:51.586
and he was the guardian of those mysteries.

698
00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:53.420
And so, if you're gonna revive the goddess tradition,

699
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.680
as we are doing now, you also have to revive

700
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.704
the tradition of the goddess' son.

701
00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:01.303
And that's who he is.

702
00:30:01.303 --> 00:30:03.499
<v Voiceover>And when we talk about alchemy,</v>

703
00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:07.318
this is really central to what you perceive

704
00:30:07.318 --> 00:30:09.738
and understand alchemy to be,

705
00:30:09.738 --> 00:30:14.190
which is the marriage of the male and the female,

706
00:30:14.996 --> 00:30:17.727
or the dualities of everything, right?

707
00:30:17.727 --> 00:30:19.229
<v ->That's exactly it.</v>

708
00:30:19.229 --> 00:30:21.523
A lot of people think that alchemy is simply

709
00:30:21.523 --> 00:30:24.253
taking two different substances,

710
00:30:24.253 --> 00:30:26.908
two polar opposite substances, uniting them together

711
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:29.650
and creating some elixir of immortality,

712
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.826
(mumbles), immortality or whatever.

713
00:30:31.826 --> 00:30:34.074
That is part of alchemy.

714
00:30:34.074 --> 00:30:36.837
But there's a higher level of alchemy,

715
00:30:36.837 --> 00:30:39.055
a more secret level of alchemy which has to do

716
00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:41.817
with uniting the male, female energies

717
00:30:41.817 --> 00:30:43.749
within the human body.

718
00:30:43.749 --> 00:30:47.000
And there are many practices, the practices of yoga,

719
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.782
essentially do that.

720
00:30:48.782 --> 00:30:51.038
Yogi is a form of alchemy.

721
00:30:51.555 --> 00:30:53.625
So once you unite the male, female together

722
00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:57.145
through these practices, then a fire is created.

723
00:30:57.145 --> 00:31:00.920
This is the fire of alchemy, fire of transformation.

724
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.408
And that goes to awaken your latent flame,

725
00:31:04.408 --> 00:31:07.544
your latent fire, your latent Kundalini that they say

726
00:31:07.544 --> 00:31:08.919
exists at the base of your spine.

727
00:31:08.919 --> 00:31:10.444
And once that's awakened, it does all the work

728
00:31:10.444 --> 00:31:13.411
of transforming you and all that.

729
00:31:13.411 --> 00:31:15.880
So yeah, it's very, very important part

730
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.842
of the Gnostic path.

731
00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.634
You might say that Gnosis and alchemy,

732
00:31:19.634 --> 00:31:20.593
they're two sides of the same coin.

733
00:31:20.593 --> 00:31:22.235
You can't separate the two.

734
00:31:22.235 --> 00:31:26.009
In order to achieve Gnosis, alchemy has to occur.

735
00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:29.550
And once you're on the Gnostic path for any given time,

736
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.069
alchemy naturally occurs within you,

737
00:31:32.512 --> 00:31:35.317
because, if you're practicing Gnosis,

738
00:31:35.317 --> 00:31:38.261
you are balancing the right, the left,

739
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:39.850
the male, the female, the left brain

740
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.314
and the right brain, that's true Gnosis.

741
00:31:41.314 --> 00:31:43.286
That's the combination, the coming together

742
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:46.410
of the intuition and the intellect.

743
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.767
<v Voiceover>On that note, let's go right into the grail.</v>

744
00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:50.316
This is a really meaty subject.

745
00:31:50.316 --> 00:31:52.447
There have been certainly lots of speculation

746
00:31:52.447 --> 00:31:54.538
and a lot of historical perspective

747
00:31:54.538 --> 00:31:55.978
on what the grail may be.

748
00:31:55.978 --> 00:31:57.524
But what you've just touched on, I think,

749
00:31:57.524 --> 00:31:59.328
is closer to part of what you have come

750
00:31:59.328 --> 00:32:01.282
to see the grail as.

751
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:06.278
<v ->One thing we try to do in our order is, make the</v>

752
00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:11.875
holy grail more personal and more attainable for people,

753
00:32:12.785 --> 00:32:13.955
that they don't think they have to become

754
00:32:13.955 --> 00:32:17.928
Indiana Jones and go to Petra to find it, whatever.

755
00:32:18.349 --> 00:32:20.743
You can find it within your own self.

756
00:32:20.743 --> 00:32:24.525
It's basically a matter of uniting the polarity

757
00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:27.311
within yourself and getting that activation.

758
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:28.514
And there's many ways you can do that.

759
00:32:28.514 --> 00:32:31.661
Yoga, meditation, you can go to vortexes.

760
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:35.456
Vortex is, a vortex is created by a male line

761
00:32:35.456 --> 00:32:37.077
uniting with a female line to create

762
00:32:37.077 --> 00:32:39.605
an upward moving spiral, which is the serpent.

763
00:32:39.605 --> 00:32:42.516
If you sit within that energy field,

764
00:32:42.516 --> 00:32:45.875
your polarity unites and your upward moving spiral,

765
00:32:45.875 --> 00:32:48.945
your upward moving Kundalini energy, is awakend.

766
00:32:48.945 --> 00:32:52.251
So this is why we have our preceptory hearing in Sedona.

767
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:53.882
<v Voiceover>Yes, and people come from all over the world</v>

768
00:32:53.882 --> 00:32:54.992
to Sedona.
<v Mark>Exactly.</v>

769
00:32:54.992 --> 00:32:55.952
<v Voiceover>For this reason.</v>

770
00:32:55.952 --> 00:32:59.012
To sit in these vortexes, both male and female,

771
00:32:59.012 --> 00:33:00.473
upward and downward spirals.

772
00:33:00.473 --> 00:33:01.340
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

773
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.103
What's special about Sedona is the red rock.

774
00:33:04.103 --> 00:33:06.235
There is a very high concentration of iron.

775
00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:11.651
So the natural spiral

776
00:33:11.651 --> 00:33:15.223
is empowered

777
00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:18.427
and is greatly energized

778
00:33:18.427 --> 00:33:20.453
by this iron in the red rock.

779
00:33:20.453 --> 00:33:23.078
It moves it quicker and amplifies it.

780
00:33:23.078 --> 00:33:25.658
And if you get within the field of the red rock,

781
00:33:25.658 --> 00:33:28.785
your electromagnetic field is activated.

782
00:33:28.785 --> 00:33:31.707
And if you start activating your electromagnetic field,

783
00:33:31.707 --> 00:33:33.595
then higher levels get activated,

784
00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:35.322
especially the second one, the ethereal body

785
00:33:35.322 --> 00:33:36.930
where Kundalini exists.

786
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.264
But another reason is because the red rock

787
00:33:38.264 --> 00:33:40.367
also vibrates in your root chakra

788
00:33:40.367 --> 00:33:43.203
with the frequency of which is the red color.

789
00:33:43.203 --> 00:33:44.813
So you're constantly...

790
00:33:45.293 --> 00:33:46.244
<v Voiceover>Stirring things up.</v>

791
00:33:46.244 --> 00:33:47.915
Having lived here for seven years, (giggles)

792
00:33:47.915 --> 00:33:48.998
it stirs things up.

793
00:33:48.998 --> 00:33:50.918
<v ->It's the Sedona Shake 'n' Bake, right?</v>

794
00:33:50.918 --> 00:33:52.247
I mean, we're all,

795
00:33:52.495 --> 00:33:55.440
either we've got a strong Kundalini

796
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.149
activation going on, or we're always this close to it,

797
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:59.447
all of us that are here.

798
00:33:59.447 --> 00:34:00.195
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

799
00:34:00.195 --> 00:34:01.665
That's very true.

800
00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:05.355
And so, the grail, in your understanding, then,

801
00:34:05.355 --> 00:34:08.160
is really more the awakening and uniting

802
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.985
of these energies within every single individual?

803
00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:13.525
It's the light coming back to knowledge?

804
00:34:13.525 --> 00:34:15.429
<v ->Absolutely. Absolutely.</v>

805
00:34:15.432 --> 00:34:17.853
If you study the holy grail tradition,

806
00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:19.378
you'll find that there's many, many holy grails.

807
00:34:19.378 --> 00:34:21.959
There was never just one holy grail, never was.

808
00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:24.418
And you'll also find that,

809
00:34:25.735 --> 00:34:27.112
generally, what makes something a holy grail is,

810
00:34:27.112 --> 00:34:29.088
it was in contact with a Great Master.

811
00:34:29.088 --> 00:34:31.136
Either he blessed it, or somehow it had been

812
00:34:31.136 --> 00:34:32.234
in contact with his person.

813
00:34:32.234 --> 00:34:34.741
For example, the articles of the passion.

814
00:34:34.741 --> 00:34:36.725
You know, the crown of thorns,

815
00:34:36.725 --> 00:34:40.340
the cross, the veil of Veronica, the shroud,

816
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.581
all those things acquire the powers of holy grails

817
00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:44.754
because they were in contact with Jesus,

818
00:34:44.754 --> 00:34:46.558
who was full of that holy grail power,

819
00:34:46.558 --> 00:34:47.634
that holy grail energy.

820
00:34:47.634 --> 00:34:48.712
And this is the way it is today.

821
00:34:48.712 --> 00:34:51.154
Of course, the cup held his blood and his sweat.

822
00:34:51.154 --> 00:34:55.044
It's totally infused with that holy grail power.

823
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.180
So it's always been the power.

824
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.510
It's always been the frequency.

825
00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:02.652
<v Voiceover>You also, in the same talk,</v>

826
00:35:02.652 --> 00:35:04.828
and we'll go from there into this,

827
00:35:04.828 --> 00:35:07.142
one of the subjects you were speaking about

828
00:35:07.142 --> 00:35:10.332
was the expected return of the hidden king of the world.

829
00:35:10.332 --> 00:35:11.750
What does that mean?

830
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.155
Who's that being, and what does that mean?

831
00:35:14.939 --> 00:35:16.219
<v ->Well, (sighs)</v>

832
00:35:16.219 --> 00:35:18.018
how many days do you have? (laughs)

833
00:35:18.018 --> 00:35:21.257
<v Voiceover>Can you do it in three minutes or less?</v>

834
00:35:21.658 --> 00:35:23.350
<v ->That'd be a record for me.</v>

835
00:35:24.134 --> 00:35:25.235
<v Voiceover>We'll try.</v>

836
00:35:25.235 --> 00:35:27.663
<v ->Basically, go back to</v>

837
00:35:27.663 --> 00:35:30.603
the goddess culture and her son.

838
00:35:30.603 --> 00:35:33.056
Her son was the Green Man.

839
00:35:33.056 --> 00:35:36.837
There's a legend, basically,

840
00:35:36.837 --> 00:35:40.059
that there was a consciousness

841
00:35:40.059 --> 00:35:44.011
that came to this Earth, 1,000s, millions of years ago,

842
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:47.369
which the Yezidis refer to as the Peacock Angel,

843
00:35:47.973 --> 00:35:51.300
that came here and infused its energy

844
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.651
and consciousness into this planet.

845
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.133
They say that the Peacock Angel arrived

846
00:35:55.133 --> 00:35:57.491
when this was totally desolation on this planet,

847
00:35:57.491 --> 00:35:58.729
and it came down.

848
00:35:58.729 --> 00:36:01.010
It spread its colors, those peacock colors

849
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.865
in its plumes, around the planet.

850
00:36:02.865 --> 00:36:04.520
And then it left.

851
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.696
But it left a part of itself.

852
00:36:06.696 --> 00:36:10.291
And so, basically, the soul of this planet

853
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:11.506
is what was left behind.

854
00:36:11.506 --> 00:36:13.458
It's like a part of the Peacock Angel's,

855
00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:16.345
part of this consciousness that came,

856
00:36:16.345 --> 00:36:19.224
which became known as the king of the world.

857
00:36:19.224 --> 00:36:21.976
It is a consciousness, a definite consciousness.

858
00:36:21.976 --> 00:36:24.604
In (mumbles), they refer to it as the Planetary Logos,

859
00:36:24.604 --> 00:36:26.475
the Planetary Mind.

860
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.455
<v Voiceover>The Gaia.</v>

861
00:36:28.455 --> 00:36:29.734
Is that the same as Gaia?

862
00:36:29.734 --> 00:36:30.385
<v ->Gaia.</v>

863
00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:31.815
Yeah, it is.

864
00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:33.842
But essentially,

865
00:36:34.934 --> 00:36:36.961
the son of the goddess

866
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:39.456
is essentially the divine mind and the power

867
00:36:39.456 --> 00:36:42.215
of the infinite spirit.

868
00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:45.067
And the son of the goddess is passed,

869
00:36:45.067 --> 00:36:47.538
he is the energy that's passed down

870
00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.925
through all lineages through all time.

871
00:36:48.925 --> 00:36:50.685
He's the Quetzlcoatl, he's the Hermes,

872
00:36:50.685 --> 00:36:52.929
he's the Divine Mind and the power.

873
00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:56.946
They say in the East that there have a lineage

874
00:36:56.946 --> 00:36:59.944
of masters that refer to them,

875
00:37:01.144 --> 00:37:03.428
refer to themselves as the king of the world.

876
00:37:04.394 --> 00:37:06.593
On some level, they are directing

877
00:37:06.593 --> 00:37:08.777
everything that's happening on this planet.

878
00:37:08.777 --> 00:37:10.836
But it appears as though it's been a lineage,

879
00:37:10.836 --> 00:37:12.073
just like the other lineages.

880
00:37:12.073 --> 00:37:15.651
And each king of the world receives

881
00:37:16.435 --> 00:37:17.694
the Divine Mind and the power

882
00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:21.535
of this original Green Man

883
00:37:21.535 --> 00:37:23.601
or this original consciousness.

884
00:37:23.601 --> 00:37:24.923
<v Voiceover>Who's still protecting and acting</v>

885
00:37:24.923 --> 00:37:26.855
on behalf of the goddess?

886
00:37:26.855 --> 00:37:27.751
<v ->Um-hm.</v>

887
00:37:27.751 --> 00:37:29.030
<v Voiceover>So how does that infor-,</v>

888
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.484
what is it that he's protecting and acting on behalf of,

889
00:37:31.484 --> 00:37:34.779
and what is the reemergence of this being,

890
00:37:34.779 --> 00:37:36.585
what does this mean?

891
00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.054
<v ->He is, essentially,</v>

892
00:37:42.054 --> 00:37:46.025
he is the essence of the goddess' teachings.

893
00:37:46.025 --> 00:37:49.411
He is the Gnosis, he is the alchemical power

894
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:50.850
that gets initiated.

895
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.177
He teaches, the true wisdom of the goddess

896
00:37:54.177 --> 00:37:56.417
is the wisdom of the infinite,

897
00:37:56.417 --> 00:37:57.741
the wisdom of everything.

898
00:37:57.741 --> 00:37:59.339
And he teaches that through working through you

899
00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:01.520
and opening up your Gnostic centers.

900
00:38:02.527 --> 00:38:04.929
But at some point, a lot of his wisdom

901
00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:06.955
was written down, documented,

902
00:38:06.955 --> 00:38:10.170
and those became the texts of the mystery schools.

903
00:38:12.053 --> 00:38:13.747
And he's always said to be the founder.

904
00:38:13.747 --> 00:38:15.894
He's the founder of the Great White Brotherhood.

905
00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:18.025
And the Great White Brotherhood, like all

906
00:38:18.025 --> 00:38:20.148
the great mystery schools around the world,

907
00:38:20.148 --> 00:38:21.994
the most important teaching was the teaching

908
00:38:21.994 --> 00:38:24.845
of alchemy and Gnosis.

909
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.531
Now, how his presence is gonna be known again

910
00:38:28.531 --> 00:38:30.146
is that,

911
00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:33.427
on a fourth dimensional plane,

912
00:38:33.427 --> 00:38:35.506
which a lot of us are gonna be able to see into,

913
00:38:35.506 --> 00:38:37.740
a lot of us already can,

914
00:38:38.632 --> 00:38:41.238
we're going to be able to see him.

915
00:38:41.843 --> 00:38:43.259
This is what the Yazidis have told me.

916
00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:45.840
This is what I've experienced personally,

917
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.719
is, if you get into his dimension,

918
00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:51.078
first of all, everything turns into eyes.

919
00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:53.638
You see, like, zillions of eyes around you.

920
00:38:53.638 --> 00:38:54.648
But, you know what's interesting, it's like

921
00:38:54.648 --> 00:38:56.759
all the forms of nature open their eyes at the same time.

922
00:38:56.759 --> 00:38:59.687
Everything's been asleep and just, like, woke up.

923
00:39:00.055 --> 00:39:01.473
But then you look at the eyes, and, well,

924
00:39:01.473 --> 00:39:02.284
they're not human eyes.

925
00:39:02.284 --> 00:39:03.487
What's different about them?

926
00:39:03.487 --> 00:39:05.516
And then you see, "Well, okay, I got it.

927
00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:07.370
"Those are the eyes of the peacock feather."

928
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.447
And then you look at them some more.

929
00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:10.016
"Oh, well, they are a peacock feather."

930
00:39:10.016 --> 00:39:11.828
And then you see these peacock feathers are joined

931
00:39:11.828 --> 00:39:13.792
as little peacocks.

932
00:39:13.792 --> 00:39:16.010
You got little peacocks running around your legs.

933
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.023
And then you see these little peacocks

934
00:39:17.023 --> 00:39:18.996
are joined as bigger peacocks, and these are joined

935
00:39:18.996 --> 00:39:20.255
as bigger peacocks.

936
00:39:20.255 --> 00:39:21.940
And then you look around and virtually,

937
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.561
the mountains turn into peacocks.

938
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:25.487
It's the most bizarre thing you ever seen.

939
00:39:25.957 --> 00:39:27.813
I been trained, I was trained for a number of years

940
00:39:27.813 --> 00:39:29.155
in Shamanism down in Peru,

941
00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:31.352
and that's where I started having these visions

942
00:39:31.352 --> 00:39:32.408
of the Peacock Angel.

943
00:39:32.408 --> 00:39:34.520
And I was, like, I didn't know what it was

944
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.134
until I started studying with the Yazidis.

945
00:39:37.134 --> 00:39:38.810
<v Voiceover>So once you have little peacocks</v>

946
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.119
and the mountain's a peacock,

947
00:39:40.119 --> 00:39:43.381
feathers and eyes and everything, then what?

948
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.474
What happens next?

949
00:39:45.474 --> 00:39:50.127
<v ->Well, first of all, you say, "Oh, my God."</v>

950
00:39:50.634 --> 00:39:51.886
<v Voiceover>There are a lot of peacock eyes around here.</v>

951
00:39:51.886 --> 00:39:52.762
<v ->Where am I?</v>

952
00:39:52.762 --> 00:39:55.251
I'm in the land of the peacock, what is this?

953
00:39:55.251 --> 00:39:57.034
And then you come to find out.

954
00:39:57.034 --> 00:39:58.997
One of the experiences is

955
00:39:58.997 --> 00:40:02.390
that you realize that all those feathers,

956
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.726
all those eyes, all those feathers, are part of you.

957
00:40:04.726 --> 00:40:06.539
You are the Peacock Angel.

958
00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:08.960
He is us and we are he.

959
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.595
On some level, he is us and we are him.

960
00:40:12.595 --> 00:40:13.897
<v Voiceover>We're the creators.</v>

961
00:40:13.897 --> 00:40:15.006
<v ->Yeah.</v>

962
00:40:15.006 --> 00:40:16.254
<v Voiceover>Co-creators.</v>

963
00:40:16.254 --> 00:40:17.086
<v ->Right.</v>

964
00:40:17.086 --> 00:40:18.664
Another way of looking at it, too, is,

965
00:40:18.664 --> 00:40:22.344
if he is the consciousness of this world,

966
00:40:23.044 --> 00:40:25.460
his will moves through all of us, it walks

967
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.093
on the surface of it.

968
00:40:27.093 --> 00:40:29.559
So we are him and he's us.

969
00:40:32.167 --> 00:40:35.580
He was the first form, the first form

970
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.310
that spirit took when it came into manifestation.

971
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.296
We are that spirit that took that first form.

972
00:40:41.296 --> 00:40:43.708
That's why he is us and we are him.

973
00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:45.317
<v Voiceover>So we're returning to--</v>

974
00:40:45.317 --> 00:40:47.568
<v ->We're returning to our powers.</v>

975
00:40:47.568 --> 00:40:48.683
<v Voiceover>Us.</v>

976
00:40:48.683 --> 00:40:50.474
<v ->Exactly, we're returning to us.</v>

977
00:40:50.474 --> 00:40:52.267
<v Voiceover>Our true selves.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

978
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:55.186
Another thing that happens when you see yourself

979
00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.948
as the Peacock Angel, what happens?

980
00:40:57.948 --> 00:41:00.507
You say, "God, don't I look nice?"

981
00:41:00.507 --> 00:41:01.585
<v Voiceover>"Aren't I beautiful?"</v>

982
00:41:01.585 --> 00:41:03.655
<v ->"Never looked quite this nice."</v>

983
00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:05.932
And you see where the pride crept in.

984
00:41:05.932 --> 00:41:07.495
And that's a whole another chapter

985
00:41:07.495 --> 00:41:09.615
of the Peacock Angel, because there was the fall,

986
00:41:09.615 --> 00:41:11.396
there was the Luciferian legend,

987
00:41:11.396 --> 00:41:13.508
which is totally different than what we know in the West.

988
00:41:13.508 --> 00:41:15.215
But there was a fall.

989
00:41:15.215 --> 00:41:16.335
It was a fall.

990
00:41:16.335 --> 00:41:19.322
Because the lord of this planet did fall,

991
00:41:19.322 --> 00:41:22.149
it did become Lucifer, you know?

992
00:41:22.149 --> 00:41:24.558
But it became Lucifer through us,

993
00:41:24.558 --> 00:41:27.386
because he's the collective conscious of us all,

994
00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:28.366
through the ego, exactly.

995
00:41:28.366 --> 00:41:29.016
<v Voiceover>Through the ego.</v>

996
00:41:29.016 --> 00:41:30.255
Vanity, greed.

997
00:41:30.255 --> 00:41:32.288
<v ->The human will became the will of the ego.</v>

998
00:41:33.018 --> 00:41:35.515
He fell, we fell, we all fell together.

999
00:41:35.515 --> 00:41:36.955
<v Voiceover>This all comes back around again,</v>

1000
00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:37.948
and we get another chance.

1001
00:41:37.948 --> 00:41:40.443
But we don't necessarily have to go into ego?

1002
00:41:40.443 --> 00:41:43.699
<v ->No. But the ego was necessary.</v>

1003
00:41:44.387 --> 00:41:46.142
We had to go through that process of ego

1004
00:41:46.142 --> 00:41:49.092
so that we would feel totally separate from each other

1005
00:41:49.092 --> 00:41:51.075
and say, "Well, what is this?

1006
00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.376
"What is going on?

1007
00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.392
"I don't like this, I'm gonna find something.

1008
00:41:54.392 --> 00:41:56.419
"There's gotta be more to life."

1009
00:41:56.419 --> 00:41:58.195
And then you go on a search that takes you

1010
00:41:58.195 --> 00:41:59.720
inside yourself, and so that point,

1011
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.388
finally you realize, "Wow. I know who I am.

1012
00:42:02.388 --> 00:42:03.464
"I know what this is all about.

1013
00:42:03.464 --> 00:42:05.661
"I know I'm God, goddess incarnated physical body.

1014
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:08.360
"And I know that I created this, I know it all."

1015
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.291
So we have to go through that phase,

1016
00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:11.954
in order to go on that search.

1017
00:42:11.954 --> 00:42:13.193
We had to go through that process.

1018
00:42:13.193 --> 00:42:15.101
It wasn't a negative or bad thing, it wasn't

1019
00:42:15.101 --> 00:42:16.914
necessarily a fall.

1020
00:42:16.914 --> 00:42:19.837
It was just the next stage of evolution.

1021
00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:20.956
<v Voiceover>So in that evolution,</v>

1022
00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:24.209
we shall all become self-empowered heretics.

1023
00:42:24.209 --> 00:42:26.465
(both laugh)
<v ->I like that.</v>

1024
00:42:27.368 --> 00:42:28.892
<v Voiceover>And I do, too, actually.</v>

1025
00:42:28.892 --> 00:42:30.049
<v ->I'll subscribe to that.</v>

1026
00:42:30.049 --> 00:42:31.361
<v Voiceover>I think most people watching these</v>

1027
00:42:31.361 --> 00:42:32.758
can resonate with that.

1028
00:42:32.758 --> 00:42:35.340
And that is the journey of the Gnostic Templar.

1029
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.851
And I have a question to ask you now.

1030
00:42:37.851 --> 00:42:39.435
I don't know if this is fair, and I don't mean

1031
00:42:39.435 --> 00:42:40.735
to kind of, you know,

1032
00:42:40.735 --> 00:42:42.777
just come at you from the side on this.

1033
00:42:43.307 --> 00:42:46.108
Throughout this tradition, they repeatedly speak

1034
00:42:46.108 --> 00:42:49.286
of various incarnations of the same energy.

1035
00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:51.718
And we'd talked about some of this off-camera,

1036
00:42:51.718 --> 00:42:55.313
where that energy, that being, was then later

1037
00:42:55.313 --> 00:42:57.350
in the form of another being and another,

1038
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.811
and this knowledge was passed on

1039
00:42:58.811 --> 00:43:00.378
and preserved and passed on.

1040
00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:02.450
Do you have any kind of flickers of remembrance

1041
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:07.306
of your own heritage, perhaps, from other times?

1042
00:43:07.844 --> 00:43:11.278
<v ->My own connection to maybe the Templars</v>

1043
00:43:11.278 --> 00:43:12.334
or maybe to...?

1044
00:43:12.334 --> 00:43:13.697
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1045
00:43:13.697 --> 00:43:17.797
<v ->I have specific remembering of one,</v>

1046
00:43:18.625 --> 00:43:20.575
which must be the most important one for me,

1047
00:43:20.575 --> 00:43:22.923
at least for me to know about now,

1048
00:43:22.923 --> 00:43:25.162
because that was the one that was revealed to me.

1049
00:43:25.162 --> 00:43:27.360
And it was actually revealed to me

1050
00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.164
about the same time as when I first came down here,

1051
00:43:30.164 --> 00:43:33.088
a lot of what I call Lemurian energy,

1052
00:43:33.088 --> 00:43:36.543
a lot of remembering about the origins

1053
00:43:36.543 --> 00:43:38.250
of the Gnostic alchemical tradition

1054
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.877
and the masters that founded it.

1055
00:43:41.438 --> 00:43:43.347
Actually, I was living in Washington at the time,

1056
00:43:43.347 --> 00:43:45.320
and I walked out my back door, went into the woods

1057
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.158
and I called upon my guides, "Masters, show me

1058
00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:50.750
"who I was, what I'm doing here,

1059
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.232
"and I wanna know now.

1060
00:43:52.232 --> 00:43:53.844
"I'm not waiting any longer."

1061
00:43:53.844 --> 00:43:55.198
Okay, you know.

1062
00:43:55.198 --> 00:43:57.595
So they say, "Okay, cool it, calm down.

1063
00:43:57.595 --> 00:43:59.867
"Just go over to that hill, climb up the hill."

1064
00:43:59.867 --> 00:44:02.961
I did, plied down some ferns, lie down.

1065
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:05.189
And then my crown shakra, (vocalizes), wide open.

1066
00:44:05.189 --> 00:44:06.940
I felt this white light pour into me.

1067
00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.828
It covered me like a sheet.

1068
00:44:08.828 --> 00:44:11.270
And then, I just woke up.

1069
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.114
The dreamer woke up.

1070
00:44:13.114 --> 00:44:14.735
I was the dream.

1071
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:16.368
And I disappeared.

1072
00:44:16.368 --> 00:44:18.981
And the dreamer that woke up was a priest king

1073
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:21.156
who had lived on Lemuria when Lemuria was,

1074
00:44:21.156 --> 00:44:24.100
like, many, many, like, 1,000s of islands.

1075
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.479
And so there was many priest kings.

1076
00:44:26.479 --> 00:44:28.719
But they were like, like it's enlightened priest kings.

1077
00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:30.639
I never felt this kind of energy, this wisdom

1078
00:44:30.639 --> 00:44:32.612
that came to me at that time.

1079
00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:35.758
And so the memories came back

1080
00:44:35.758 --> 00:44:38.255
of having been there, and having been

1081
00:44:38.255 --> 00:44:39.471
the priest king of an island

1082
00:44:39.471 --> 00:44:43.709
near which is now China and Indonesia and that area.

1083
00:44:45.644 --> 00:44:47.552
And, you know, a kind of civilization

1084
00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:49.242
we'd created at that time.

1085
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.856
But then I realized that that was my initial

1086
00:44:53.374 --> 00:44:56.221
connection to this being, this consciousness,

1087
00:44:56.221 --> 00:44:58.801
this Sanat Kumara, because,

1088
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:01.010
at that time, he was considered to be the king of kings.

1089
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.268
We knew him.

1090
00:45:03.488 --> 00:45:05.227
We knew him as the king of the world.

1091
00:45:05.227 --> 00:45:06.165
<v Voiceover>It's like the Green Man,</v>

1092
00:45:06.165 --> 00:45:07.723
elemental true knowledge.

1093
00:45:07.723 --> 00:45:09.023
<v ->Yeah, right.</v>

1094
00:45:09.023 --> 00:45:11.688
Because we could sense things at that time

1095
00:45:11.688 --> 00:45:13.086
that we can't now.

1096
00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:14.856
We were more fourth dimensional.

1097
00:45:14.856 --> 00:45:16.073
I mean, so we could see him.

1098
00:45:16.073 --> 00:45:17.746
I mean, if you wanted to see the Peacock Angel,

1099
00:45:17.746 --> 00:45:19.799
he was all around.

1100
00:45:20.466 --> 00:45:23.485
And so, it was from that point on

1101
00:45:23.485 --> 00:45:25.725
I knew that I had made a strong connection

1102
00:45:25.725 --> 00:45:29.076
to that alchemical Gnostic path

1103
00:45:29.076 --> 00:45:31.677
and that, from that point on, I was going to be

1104
00:45:31.677 --> 00:45:34.993
incarnating in lifetimes to further it

1105
00:45:34.993 --> 00:45:38.204
and to preserve it, which I know I have.

1106
00:45:38.204 --> 00:45:40.216
And I have some sense of

1107
00:45:40.998 --> 00:45:44.070
incarnating during the time of the Essenes,

1108
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.854
and then certainly later on as the Templars,

1109
00:45:46.854 --> 00:45:49.577
and within India as a Yogi.

1110
00:45:50.063 --> 00:45:52.601
All related to that Gnostic alchemical path.

1111
00:45:52.601 --> 00:45:54.489
And so, now I've incarnated again

1112
00:45:54.489 --> 00:45:57.281
to work on, to help with the revival of it,

1113
00:45:57.281 --> 00:45:59.490
because now is the time.

1114
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.527
Now is the time to revive the Gnostic alchemical path

1115
00:46:01.527 --> 00:46:04.511
and the goddess tradition, all of it.

1116
00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:06.154
Together.

1117
00:46:06.154 --> 00:46:07.379
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1118
00:46:07.379 --> 00:46:10.856
And you have done an absolutely remarkable job

1119
00:46:10.856 --> 00:46:12.935
in terms of the research in your book.

1120
00:46:12.935 --> 00:46:16.564
I mean, you have pulled threads together

1121
00:46:16.564 --> 00:46:18.888
that I had no idea even existed.

1122
00:46:18.888 --> 00:46:20.796
And so, for anyone that wants to really

1123
00:46:20.796 --> 00:46:23.227
get further into the knowledge of

1124
00:46:23.227 --> 00:46:25.151
where this path came from

1125
00:46:25.151 --> 00:46:29.529
and from where all of the different alchemical

1126
00:46:29.529 --> 00:46:32.675
types of strands of knowledge came from and such,

1127
00:46:33.455 --> 00:46:35.328
they've got to read your book.

1128
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:38.404
<v ->It is the history, in the sense, I mean,</v>

1129
00:46:38.404 --> 00:46:41.185
we've abbreviated it, through me,

1130
00:46:41.185 --> 00:46:42.844
just a moment ago, but

1131
00:46:43.606 --> 00:46:44.844
this is the whole thing.

1132
00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:46.209
<v Voiceover>Yeah, there's a lot more to it.</v>

1133
00:46:46.209 --> 00:46:47.970
So if you're intrigued with this,

1134
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.881
we have the website link underneath

1135
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:53.111
the window right now where everybody's watching

1136
00:46:53.111 --> 00:46:54.816
so that we will find their way to your book.

1137
00:46:54.816 --> 00:46:57.323
And I thank you so much for taking the time today.

1138
00:46:57.323 --> 00:46:59.062
Help give us an overview and essence

1139
00:46:59.062 --> 00:47:01.419
of what the Gnostic Templars are, because again,

1140
00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:03.328
most of us have really no idea

1141
00:47:03.328 --> 00:47:05.706
because it's too clouded with all of the other

1142
00:47:05.706 --> 00:47:08.330
secret societies and verbiage of the day.

1143
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.254
<v ->Well, that is our service to the world,</v>

1144
00:47:11.254 --> 00:47:12.511
is to spread that knowledge.

1145
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:14.221
And now we're going to be going out

1146
00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:16.341
and doing a lot of seminars.

1147
00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:18.305
We wanna cover the world with this knowledge.

1148
00:47:18.305 --> 00:47:20.704
We want to actually create a network of people

1149
00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:23.305
that are working to reunite the religions

1150
00:47:23.305 --> 00:47:28.188
and show the links, and to show the common origins,

1151
00:47:28.748 --> 00:47:30.348
which is the Gnostic alchemical path,

1152
00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:33.360
and to spread Gnosis throughout the world.

1153
00:47:35.073 --> 00:47:36.801
<v ->You can go much further into the history</v>

1154
00:47:36.801 --> 00:47:39.159
of the Knight Templars by reading Mark's book,

1155
00:47:39.159 --> 00:47:40.865
Guardians of the Holy Grail.

1156
00:47:40.865 --> 00:47:44.277
It goes into a great deal of historical documentation.

1157
00:47:44.277 --> 00:47:46.390
If the subject intrigues you, you can go to Amazon

1158
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.712
or other booksellers.

1159
00:47:47.712 --> 00:47:50.359
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1160
00:47:50.359 --> 00:47:55.359
(gentle sitar music)
