00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.678
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.429
<v ->There's a type of deep wisdom that</v>

3
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.639
comes from the heart of the Russian spirit.

4
00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.999
One that knows pain, and particular, knows laughter.

5
00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:22.089
Leonid Sharashkin came into contact

6
00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.319
with the book titled, The Art of Soaring

7
00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:27.479
at a time when he needed some serious emotional adjustment.

8
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.629
He found the work to be profound, and chose

9
00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.129
to bring the book to the English speaking world,

10
00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.929
just as he did with Anastasia,

11
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.978
which he also continues to this day.

12
00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:46.969
<v ->I completed the translation of all nine</v>

13
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.269
volumes in the Ringing Cedar series.

14
00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.809
And now I'm traveling throughout the world,

15
00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.719
giving workshops about how to turn this dream into reality.

16
00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.409
And I see that, no matter where I go,

17
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.489
even to Japan, where the books are not yet

18
00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.308
available in the Japanese language,

19
00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:06.019
people can relate to the essence of their messages.

20
00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:08.128
And people are crying and laughing.

21
00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:13.128
And I presented even a talk at Dance Academy in Japan.

22
00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:14.979
Professional dancers.

23
00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.049
Two months later, I received an email from them,

24
00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.337
with them dancing on a potato planting.

25
00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:22.778
They're planting they're dikons and vegetables.

26
00:01:22.778 --> 00:01:24.998
So it's amazing how these simple messages

27
00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:28.158
are returning, are regaining this joy of

28
00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:31.277
living, not through some kind of special practices,

29
00:01:31.277 --> 00:01:32.977
but through your everyday life.

30
00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:34.767
They're really catching on,

31
00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:37.338
and there's so many people writing to me

32
00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:40.268
how it's really changing them on some very deep level.

33
00:01:40.418 --> 00:01:40.898
<v ->Yes.</v>

34
00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:44.598
<v ->And gives meaning to their everyday existence.</v>

35
00:01:44.598 --> 00:01:47.217
<v ->It brings a type of beauty, enchantment,</v>

36
00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:49.597
and definitely sovereignty back to the

37
00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:51.148
living experience.

38
00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:53.518
And I'm very happy to hear that,

39
00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:55.758
that's still really going strong, globally.

40
00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:57.478
Because it seems to me, that this is just the

41
00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:00.008
beginning of what our futures will be looking like.

42
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:04.157
This has to be a serious model for the future.

43
00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.338
And anyone who hasn't read it, I highly

44
00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.608
encourage them to read all nine of the books.

45
00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:10.358
As I've encouraged many, many friends and relatives

46
00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:12.058
to read the series, and everyone comes

47
00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:13.988
away with the same feeling.

48
00:02:14.077 --> 00:02:15.237
I don't know any other way to put it,

49
00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:17.717
but it's a very material, real kind of

50
00:02:17.717 --> 00:02:20.187
enchanted way of viewing our own lives.

51
00:02:20.317 --> 00:02:23.917
<v ->True, and you know, may people use the term, remembrance.</v>

52
00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:24.657
<v ->Yes, remembrance.
<v ->You read it,</v>

53
00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:27.677
and it's not that you get these concepts from the books,

54
00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:29.376
rather all of a sudden you start feeling,

55
00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:31.777
ah, this is how life should be, this is-

56
00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.977
<v ->Why didn't I think of that, it's so true!</v>

57
00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:34.535
<v ->So it is.</v>

58
00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:35.135
<v ->Exactly.</v>

59
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:40.135
<v ->These books are, they help people draw some of</v>

60
00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:44.315
the memories, some of the inspiration from

61
00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:45.805
the depth of their own being.

62
00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:46.795
<v ->Very, very true.</v>

63
00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:48.675
Well I'm glad that's still out there

64
00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:51.025
and in motion, and you're in motion, constantly.

65
00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:53.135
Because when you find something that has value,

66
00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:56.005
you really commit yourself passionately to that.

67
00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:59.874
And now, you are working with yet another project,

68
00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:01.235
a couple of projects, both of

69
00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.105
which I'm totally intrigued with.

70
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.834
And this book, which is an interesting little

71
00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:07.524
book called The Art of Soaring.

72
00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.603
And we're going to get into what that is in just a moment.

73
00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:16.793
Because it really has to do with awakening the

74
00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:18.864
adult imagination.

75
00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:22.234
And this is an incredibly challenging thing

76
00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:25.544
for a lot of people to do, shockingly so.

77
00:03:25.814 --> 00:03:28.534
<v ->Absolutely, but you know, even when I was</v>

78
00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:31.794
editing the Anastasia books, I realized that we will

79
00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.014
not be able to make a lasting change if we

80
00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.184
do not change our mindset.

81
00:03:37.594 --> 00:03:40.913
You know, today we're all really locked up in the

82
00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:42.743
negative perception of reality.

83
00:03:42.874 --> 00:03:45.654
I do not have a TV at home, but when I travel,

84
00:03:45.654 --> 00:03:49.574
I cannot escape the TV screens of CNN News at the airport.

85
00:03:49.574 --> 00:03:51.194
And what I noticed, they keep

86
00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:53.864
telling you about 10% unemployment.

87
00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:58.304
But sorry, 10% unemployment is 90% employment.

88
00:03:58.534 --> 00:04:02.373
So not all our civilization is about their conditioning

89
00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:05.044
us to see the negative side of things.

90
00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:08.174
So I felt that unless we switch our mind from

91
00:04:08.174 --> 00:04:10.914
this negative perception to the positive one,

92
00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:14.924
we won't be able really, to change anything for the better.

93
00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:16.274
So this is the very logical
<v ->No, you're right.</v>

94
00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:17.614
<v ->first step.</v>

95
00:04:17.614 --> 00:04:19.074
<v ->You're absolutely right.</v>

96
00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:23.374
And these world views that we each have, we each possess,

97
00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:24.844
start in utero.

98
00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:28.353
We're talking, well one might say they start prior to that.

99
00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:31.093
But certainly from our conception

100
00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:33.154
and to the point where we are cognizant

101
00:04:33.154 --> 00:04:34.994
on an energetic level, we're already

102
00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:37.454
being programmed just like a computer,

103
00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:42.454
to accept and reject certain, maybe certain practices,

104
00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:44.294
certain people, certain taste.

105
00:04:44.294 --> 00:04:46.024
Percubitus for all kinds of things.

106
00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:49.894
Each thing, narrowing down our potential of experience

107
00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:52.603
and completely thwarting the imagination.

108
00:04:53.134 --> 00:04:55.354
So let's talk about what the Art of Soaring is,

109
00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:57.713
so we can understand, so our viewers can understand

110
00:04:57.713 --> 00:05:00.393
why the imagination is so key to

111
00:05:00.393 --> 00:05:02.252
bringing ourselves back alive again,

112
00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:03.263
and our potential.

113
00:05:03.413 --> 00:05:06.111
<v ->You know, after translating the Anastasia books,</v>

114
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:09.141
I thought I was done with editing and translating.

115
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:11.131
I thought I would just retire to

116
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:14.191
my family farm put in pressure.

117
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:16.631
And the rest of my life to raising my family

118
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.541
and planting my vegetables.

119
00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:22.911
But I was faces with some very dramatic controversy.

120
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:25.340
And the conflict in my professional life.

121
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:27.650
And I was looking for solutions, how to

122
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.000
overcome all this feeling of frustration and negativity.

123
00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:34.801
And I came across this book, The Art of Soaring,

124
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:38.971
that is about changing our reality

125
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.881
through changing our inner world.

126
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.480
But through laughter, through humor, playfully.

127
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:47.511
You know, the concept that we are

128
00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:50.141
really the creators of our reality.

129
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:51.851
It is very popular today, it's almost

130
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.701
too commonplace to talk about it.

131
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.109
But what I noticed for many people,

132
00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.559
it becomes so serious.

133
00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.610
They create out of resolving problems,

134
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.980
with their own thought, another problem.

135
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.110
They're just, all tense, all serious about it.

136
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.210
<v ->Don't want to make the karma any worse.</v>

137
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.410
I have to get on top of this,

138
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.690
I need discipline,
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

139
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.940
<v ->I have to meditate.</v>

140
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.200
Too many have-to's.

141
00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:16.448
<v ->And it turns out in Russia, there was</v>

142
00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:19.708
an ancient tradition, and an ancient teaching

143
00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:23.008
about how to overcome our problems,

144
00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:27.357
issues, conflicts, violence, negativity, through laughter.

145
00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.988
Because laughter is this amazing energy that

146
00:06:29.988 --> 00:06:33.327
just releases all the tension, and all of sudden,

147
00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:36.028
things that you thought were impossible,

148
00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:39.198
become at your arm's reach.

149
00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:39.908
<v ->Yes.</v>

150
00:06:39.908 --> 00:06:41.928
<v ->So this is what the Art of Soaring is about.</v>

151
00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:45.198
This book gives a series of very simple techniques,

152
00:06:45.348 --> 00:06:47.668
of how to turn what you think is

153
00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:50.317
an impossible challenge, into a joke.

154
00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:54.246
And when it becomes a joke, you can no longer

155
00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:55.736
be serious about it.

156
00:06:55.826 --> 00:07:00.566
an instead of channeling all your animental energy,

157
00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:02.385
into maintaining the image of it

158
00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:04.945
as a serious issue,

159
00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:08.125
all this energy's freed up, and all of a sudden

160
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.665
the problem disappears, or at least you can

161
00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:13.525
use all this energy on resolving the problem

162
00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:15.155
rather than worrying about it.

163
00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:16.185
<v ->Yes.</v>

164
00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.205
And I had a friend who was a mentor of mine,

165
00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:19.545
and like a second mother to me

166
00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:22.465
who is from Russia, pre Bolshevik revolution,

167
00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:25.865
hoofed it out on foot with her mother as a matter of fact,

168
00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:28.885
and she kept telling me, this was during,

169
00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:30.745
this was before the wall came down.

170
00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:34.425
And this would'a been in the 70s and 80s,

171
00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:38.404
and she kept saying to me, people in the west

172
00:07:38.404 --> 00:07:42.445
don't understand, the Russian heart and soul

173
00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:47.245
is filled with an acceptance, and a living in magic

174
00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:50.205
and artistry, beyond what the outside world

175
00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:51.505
really comprehends, because it was

176
00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:54.634
at that time very cloistered during the communist years.

177
00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:55.985
<v ->I can't agree more.</v>

178
00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:57.765
And you know, it's amazing because,

179
00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:00.905
during the 1000 years of our recent history,

180
00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:05.475
Russia was constantly in war, or slavery.

181
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.985
And people could not attach themselves

182
00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:10.985
to their material possessions, like here in the west.

183
00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:13.065
Because those could be taken away from them

184
00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.495
at any moment.

185
00:08:14.564 --> 00:08:17.405
They couldn't even attach themselves to their families,

186
00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:19.905
because even wives and daughters could be

187
00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:21.884
take away to satisfy the inclinations

188
00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:23.835
of the landlord at any moment.

189
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.364
They couldn't even attach themselves to their own lives,

190
00:08:27.364 --> 00:08:29.625
because their lives could be taken away from them

191
00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.035
at any moment.

192
00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:32.965
So, you know, they had to attach themselves

193
00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:35.455
to something else, to their inner essence.

194
00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.305
And they came up with this amazing way

195
00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:42.684
of transcending all this suffering

196
00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:44.904
through laughter, through humor.

197
00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:47.882
By not even being serious about

198
00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:52.402
all these extremely traumatizing experiences

199
00:08:52.402 --> 00:08:55.422
that the Russian people had been put through

200
00:08:55.422 --> 00:08:57.712
century, after century, after century.

201
00:08:58.602 --> 00:09:01.542
<v ->Yes, and it does, it makes it for a very interesting mind.</v>

202
00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:02.862
I always noticed with my Russian friends,

203
00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:04.402
there is so much silliness,

204
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.011
silliness in the conversation, fun.

205
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:11.721
Joyful ways of portraying things that it just doesn't occur

206
00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:13.891
to most minds to even come up with.

207
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:16.020
And so I say that, because when you

208
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.460
first start reading, when I first started reading

209
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.581
The Art of Soaring, and I always thought

210
00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:21.921
well I'm pretty creative, I'm kind of loose

211
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:23.411
in that sense, I can flow with it.

212
00:09:23.921 --> 00:09:27.281
But even so, when being posed with having to create

213
00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:29.700
something to the point of extravagance

214
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.412
and absurdity, our minds have been narrowed

215
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.791
by our world views so much, it's hard to

216
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.841
access, like what would I,

217
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.871
if I could just use my mind as a pallet?

218
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.951
How would I create this situation?

219
00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:47.721
And so, can you talk to that for a little bit,

220
00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:49.561
about what we're up against, because of our

221
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:51.281
world view being so well entrenched,

222
00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:52.751
all of us, everywhere in the world.

223
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.601
<v ->Yeah, you know, we have this mental block.</v>

224
00:09:56.601 --> 00:10:00.521
We think, well silliness and playfulness

225
00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:02.531
and imagination, it's only for children.

226
00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:05.961
And we adults, we are really like serious people.

227
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:08.300
And we have our mortgage bills to worry about,

228
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.171
we have our jobs, our social status, etcetera.

229
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:13.981
So you don't see an adult climbing up in the tree

230
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:16.801
or like now, doing something the cilldren

231
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:20.381
do and enjoy doing, not because we

232
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:21.921
wouldn't enjoy it, actually i climbed

233
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.241
a tree a week ago, it was so much fun.

234
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:25.270
<v ->Yes!</v>

235
00:10:25.301 --> 00:10:27.741
<v ->But because we created the mental image</v>

236
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:29.531
of it as not being appropriate.

237
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.741
So we lock ourselves up, and with it,

238
00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:36.851
we lock up these abilities of seeing

239
00:10:37.241 --> 00:10:39.860
human laughter and lightness, even in

240
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.591
conflict and adversity.

241
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.300
You know what, I noticed even in nature,

242
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.651
nature never looks back at darkness.

243
00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:51.779
In the morning after the darkness of the night,

244
00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:54.259
after all the dangers of the night,

245
00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:56.728
and being eaten up, the birds start singing,

246
00:10:56.898 --> 00:10:59.239
instead of sitting there, serious and worrying

247
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:00.679
about all the dangers they just-

248
00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:01.659
<v ->The next night, it's going to come.</v>

249
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:02.839
<v ->Yeah, the next night!</v>

250
00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:03.759
And then another.

251
00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:04.739
<v ->Let's build a little fortress.</v>

252
00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:06.039
<v ->So instead of that, they're looking</v>

253
00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:08.008
forward to the coming of the sun.

254
00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:10.019
So The Art of Soaring is about

255
00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:12.658
reclaiming this ancient wisdom of

256
00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:16.909
not looking back at darkness, but moving towards light.

257
00:11:16.998 --> 00:11:20.759
And laughter is like this wave that carry's you

258
00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:25.208
into this new, really new existence in your

259
00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:28.447
mindset where everything is possible.

260
00:11:28.797 --> 00:11:31.197
<v ->And the men that have written this book,</v>

261
00:11:31.197 --> 00:11:34.938
Dolakov and Garongov, I don't know if I said that correctly.

262
00:11:34.938 --> 00:11:35.718
<v ->You said it correct.</v>

263
00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:36.718
<v ->Garongov, okay.</v>

264
00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:39.697
These two men are, what would be termed in Russia

265
00:11:39.697 --> 00:11:41.087
as magicians.

266
00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:43.938
Now, here we might call them like,

267
00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:47.488
very wise, artful healers.

268
00:11:47.738 --> 00:11:50.558
But talk about the difference between that,

269
00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:51.958
and the way that, for example,

270
00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.478
I love the way, I've forgotten which one of the two men

271
00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:55.567
starts their day.

272
00:11:56.117 --> 00:11:58.418
When they were talking about going in to the water,

273
00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:02.178
and doing a dance, starting to take in intuitively.

274
00:12:02.178 --> 00:12:03.898
What's going to be coming up that day.

275
00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:06.048
What defines a magician?

276
00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:08.898
<v ->So, a magician, as defined in The Art of Soaring,</v>

277
00:12:08.898 --> 00:12:12.716
is not somebody, no, all mysterious,

278
00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:17.716
or who is able to produce all kind of tricks.

279
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:21.676
Rather, it is somebody who is soaring,

280
00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:23.855
who is light in his inner being.

281
00:12:23.855 --> 00:12:26.046
Who is playful in life.

282
00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:29.146
So the authors, they're just ordinary people.

283
00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:31.336
They are not gurus.

284
00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:33.216
They don't call themselves teachers.

285
00:12:33.216 --> 00:12:35.256
They are just ordinary people who figured

286
00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:37.696
out that there is this way, and there is

287
00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:40.305
this ancient teaching that they rediscovered,

288
00:12:40.755 --> 00:12:43.915
for transcending all controversy in our life,

289
00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:45.225
through humor.

290
00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:50.084
So, there they start with laughter, with humor.

291
00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:54.655
And there, I was intrigued by this book

292
00:12:54.655 --> 00:12:57.215
and it helped me a lot, to redefine

293
00:12:57.215 --> 00:13:00.845
how I saw controversy and darkness in problems in my life.

294
00:13:01.175 --> 00:13:04.275
But actually before committing to translating

295
00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:06.275
this book, and making it available,

296
00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:07.655
in the English language, I really wanted

297
00:13:07.655 --> 00:13:10.265
also to see whether the approach really worked.

298
00:13:10.973 --> 00:13:13.963
The book contains theoretical sections.

299
00:13:14.153 --> 00:13:17.203
The discussion of the principles.

300
00:13:17.273 --> 00:13:17.872
<v ->Yes.</v>

301
00:13:17.872 --> 00:13:22.783
<v ->Why these light hearted playful approach, really works.</v>

302
00:13:22.933 --> 00:13:25.652
And the second part of the book is the real

303
00:13:25.652 --> 00:13:27.453
life success stories of the people

304
00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:29.362
who started applying these techniques.

305
00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:32.433
So I wanted to see on my own experience

306
00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:35.083
whether it held any truth to it, and it worked.

307
00:13:35.713 --> 00:13:36.623
It did work.

308
00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.233
<v ->And you went through the entire process?</v>

309
00:13:39.233 --> 00:13:40.613
<v ->Yeah, can I give you an example?</v>

310
00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:41.772
<v ->Yes, please do.</v>

311
00:13:41.772 --> 00:13:44.632
<v ->So one of the techniques presented in the books</v>

312
00:13:44.632 --> 00:13:49.632
are if you come across conflict or some darkness,

313
00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:54.533
find something positive within the negative,

314
00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.713
and exaggerate it to such an extreme

315
00:13:56.713 --> 00:13:58.303
that it will become laughable.

316
00:13:58.513 --> 00:13:59.073
<v ->Yes.</v>

317
00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:02.012
<v ->And when you arrive at this image that made you laugh</v>

318
00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:05.113
instead of cringing inside, stick to this image

319
00:14:05.113 --> 00:14:07.403
in your inner side, and the problem will disappear.

320
00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:09.443
So this is how it worked for me.

321
00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:13.823
At that time I was in a rural place in Missouri.

322
00:14:14.013 --> 00:14:17.743
And there, and my place was not accessible by large trucks.

323
00:14:17.892 --> 00:14:20.352
So whenever I had a delivery of furniture

324
00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:24.232
or another big piece, I needed to go to an intersection

325
00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:26.212
of two rural highways where there was a

326
00:14:26.212 --> 00:14:29.332
parking spot where the big truck would park.

327
00:14:29.332 --> 00:14:31.762
And I would unload it on my car and take it home.

328
00:14:32.632 --> 00:14:37.632
So this parking space was surrounded by grass, by a lawn.

329
00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:41.432
And it was private property already,

330
00:14:41.432 --> 00:14:43.142
but it was not demarcated.

331
00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:46.452
So you couldn't tell really, where the public parking space,

332
00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:49.182
and when the private property began.

333
00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:53.872
And the owner of the lawn lived across the road,

334
00:14:53.872 --> 00:14:55.762
and owned a convenience store.

335
00:14:56.032 --> 00:14:59.611
So, because I am a foreigner,

336
00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:02.022
or in the legal sense, an alien.

337
00:15:02.352 --> 00:15:04.592
And I have an accent, and you know, in rural Missouri,

338
00:15:04.592 --> 00:15:07.112
people are very conservative, they do not like

339
00:15:07.112 --> 00:15:08.362
anybody who is different.

340
00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:10.211
So he was singling me out.

341
00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:13.972
So whenever a truck was coming to deliver something for me,

342
00:15:13.972 --> 00:15:16.352
and some times going with the rear wheel

343
00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:21.082
of the truck over his grass, he would jump out of his

344
00:15:21.112 --> 00:15:24.742
convenience store and start yelling at us across the road.

345
00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:26.941
"You guys get off my land!"

346
00:15:27.451 --> 00:15:30.212
And one time he even called 911,

347
00:15:30.212 --> 00:15:32.011
saying that there are some aliens who are

348
00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:34.102
trespassing on his property.

349
00:15:34.192 --> 00:15:35.272
So sheriffs came.

350
00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:39.232
So now, because of this outburst of anger against me,

351
00:15:39.232 --> 00:15:42.391
I started feeling very tense every time I had

352
00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:45.142
a deliver of a few boxes or something coming my way.

353
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.330
And it's one thing to have a personal relationship issue,

354
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.029
it's another not to sleep well

355
00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:53.020
when you're expecting it literally, right.

356
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.549
Or even driving by his
<v ->Right!</v>

357
00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:56.900
<v ->convenience store, I will always fell, augh!</v>

358
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.119
So I needed to do something about it.

359
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.420
And I noticed that he enjoyed greatly, his social status.

360
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.620
He had a massive golden ring, with a precious stone.

361
00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:11.000
And his convenience store was sort of a community center.

362
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.730
All the real men from the community

363
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.318
would come in the evening to play dominoes there.

364
00:16:15.568 --> 00:16:17.328
And he would stay behind the counter

365
00:16:17.328 --> 00:16:20.149
and put his hand with this massive golden

366
00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:23.239
ring on top of the counter, and watch the game.

367
00:16:23.489 --> 00:16:26.829
<v ->So I started playing out in my imagination</v>

368
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:28.319
this absent scenario.

369
00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:31.259
So there is this game of dominoes happening one evening.

370
00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:33.909
And at the very decisive moment,

371
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:36.689
he comes forward and takes out of his pocket

372
00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:39.749
a six, six, domino stone, and then starts

373
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:43.039
spinning in his hand, until it's the size of this room.

374
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:44.899
Like this huge pallet.

375
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:47.729
And then he puts it crashing down, on the table.

376
00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:49.779
The table collapses, and he wins the game.

377
00:16:50.249 --> 00:16:55.059
And all the players look up at him in amazement and awe.

378
00:16:55.289 --> 00:16:58.569
And from this point onwards, this legend starts

379
00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:00.049
circulating, and this rumor that he's

380
00:17:00.049 --> 00:17:02.359
the best domino player in the world.

381
00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:05.329
So people from all over America start coming to

382
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.719
his convenience store to learn domino playing from the man.

383
00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:12.729
And then people from all over the world start coming

384
00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:15.049
and they build an international airport

385
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:17.359
close to this rural intersection in Missouri.

386
00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:20.869
And direct flights from New York, Tokyo, Moscow,

387
00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.709
from all over the world, landing like-

388
00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.609
<v ->This is the lavish absurd part, I love it.</v>

389
00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.929
<v ->And he builds bigger domino playing academy</v>

390
00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:31.069
of the world, a marble, white building, a skyscraper

391
00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:33.419
with the six, six domino on top of it.

392
00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:36.529
So now, when I arrived at this absurd image,

393
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:39.419
I laughed, I could no longer be serious.

394
00:17:39.788 --> 00:17:42.719
And all of a sudden, I felt all this tension falling away.

395
00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:46.189
You know what happened, not a single time

396
00:17:46.189 --> 00:17:48.789
ever since, has he even walked out of

397
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:51.438
his convenience store when my trucks were coming.

398
00:17:51.468 --> 00:17:53.108
They continued coming regularly,

399
00:17:53.108 --> 00:17:54.798
but the problem just dissolved.

400
00:17:54.868 --> 00:17:56.687
For some time I was even concerned whether

401
00:17:56.687 --> 00:17:58.957
he was alive or not, because he just,

402
00:17:58.987 --> 00:18:00.367
<v ->He wasn't threatening you.
<v ->He wasn't there,</v>

403
00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:02.977
he disappeared pretty much.

404
00:18:03.007 --> 00:18:07.487
but one time I saw him riding a mower, mowing his lawn.

405
00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:08.907
So I know he is alright, he is well.

406
00:18:08.907 --> 00:18:12.946
But his attitude, his anger, all this conflict

407
00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:15.027
all of a sudden disappeared, just because

408
00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.707
through laughter, through humor, through

409
00:18:16.707 --> 00:18:19.027
playing this technique from The Art of Soaring.

410
00:18:19.027 --> 00:18:21.567
I dissolved the conflict within myself,

411
00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:25.217
and saw it dissolving in my real life.

412
00:18:25.987 --> 00:18:29.367
<v ->I find it just beautiful, a beautiful way to do it.</v>

413
00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:30.906
So much better than thinking, oh well,

414
00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:33.987
we have to have a talk, and that way that

415
00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:35.226
usually does not work, because

416
00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:37.687
it hasn't resolved anything in your field.

417
00:18:37.687 --> 00:18:39.667
It hasn't resolved anything in their field.

418
00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:41.727
But what's so cool about it, is that

419
00:18:41.727 --> 00:18:44.787
at the same time, you are feeding him

420
00:18:44.787 --> 00:18:46.777
the thing that he most desires.

421
00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:47.886
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

422
00:18:47.886 --> 00:18:49.157
<v ->He wants to be honored.</v>

423
00:18:49.327 --> 00:18:51.777
He wants to feel in control of his own life.

424
00:18:51.907 --> 00:18:55.967
And you created this quantum field of absolute

425
00:18:55.967 --> 00:18:58.397
honoring in abundance for him.

426
00:18:58.487 --> 00:19:00.477
And this is that gifting thing, right?

427
00:19:00.527 --> 00:19:01.047
<v ->True.</v>

428
00:19:01.047 --> 00:19:03.137
<v ->Even to the point where it's an absurd cartoon.</v>

429
00:19:03.187 --> 00:19:07.047
But nonetheless, that's a lot of supportive

430
00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:09.287
incoming energy, even though you're doing it

431
00:19:09.287 --> 00:19:11.097
to release your own tension, right?

432
00:19:11.247 --> 00:19:13.777
<v ->Absolutely, and you know, it works for anybody.</v>

433
00:19:13.927 --> 00:19:16.147
I started sharing these techniques with people

434
00:19:16.147 --> 00:19:17.407
here in America, and of course that

435
00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:19.897
many people already read The Art of Soaring.

436
00:19:20.007 --> 00:19:22.987
So now I receive a flow of funny stories like that,

437
00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:24.907
when something magical happened just because

438
00:19:24.907 --> 00:19:27.437
people changed their attitude within.

439
00:19:27.727 --> 00:19:29.397
In the book it's called renaming.

440
00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:30.107
<v ->Yes.</v>

441
00:19:30.107 --> 00:19:33.907
<v ->You know, we lock ourselves up in a particular</v>

442
00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:35.437
view of who we are.

443
00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.687
I'm a nurse, or I'm a husband,

444
00:19:38.687 --> 00:19:40.807
or I'm this or I'm that.

445
00:19:41.145 --> 00:19:44.175
I am the one who can never earn enough money.

446
00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:47.266
Or I am the one who has this relationship issue.

447
00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:49.796
Or I am the one who, etcetera, etcetera.

448
00:19:49.946 --> 00:19:51.286
So we create an image.

449
00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:53.436
I am this, I am that.

450
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.786
So the authors playfully suggest that one of

451
00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.706
the techniques is, instead of saying,

452
00:19:57.706 --> 00:20:01.696
oh I am the woman who's girlfriend is cheating one me,

453
00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:04.946
you rename yourself, well I am you know,

454
00:20:04.946 --> 00:20:07.645
I am a crocodile made out of sweet peas with

455
00:20:07.645 --> 00:20:10.536
two yellow dandelions, instead of my eyes.

456
00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:11.145
<v ->Yes.</v>

457
00:20:11.145 --> 00:20:14.714
<v ->Like, whatever your wildest imagination can show you.</v>

458
00:20:15.104 --> 00:20:17.835
And all of a sudden you notice, that the problem disappears.

459
00:20:18.424 --> 00:20:21.004
Just yesterday I shared this technique here

460
00:20:21.004 --> 00:20:24.054
with one of the attendees of my workshop.

461
00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:27.163
And she came the next day and told me,

462
00:20:27.163 --> 00:20:28.681
you know what, we had our house

463
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:31.412
on the market for six months, not a single showing.

464
00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.161
Last night I came up to talking with you

465
00:20:34.161 --> 00:20:36.761
and conveyed this technique to my husband,

466
00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:39.600
and we laughed, and then went to this vision

467
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.360
that eventually the house will be

468
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.081
purchased by aliens, extraterrestrials,

469
00:20:45.081 --> 00:20:49.521
and they will turn the subdivision laws here in Los Angeles

470
00:20:49.521 --> 00:20:53.250
into portals for communicating with other galaxies.

471
00:20:53.581 --> 00:20:56.340
So I know it was so absurd, that they all

472
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.921
laughed, and all this tension of not

473
00:20:57.921 --> 00:20:59.851
being able to sell the house disappeared.

474
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:02.261
The next morning they got a phone call from

475
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.601
their real estate agent, that somebody

476
00:21:03.601 --> 00:21:05.571
wanted to look at their property.

477
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:06.859
<v ->Yes.</v>

478
00:21:06.859 --> 00:21:09.099
<v ->Stories like that, keep piling up.</v>

479
00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:10.899
And they're always funny, and they're always

480
00:21:10.899 --> 00:21:13.639
about how all of a sudden, these concepts

481
00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:16.919
of changing your reality, through changing your inner world

482
00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:18.809
become accessible to everybody.

483
00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.938
Because laughter and human imagination

484
00:21:20.938 --> 00:21:23.289
is something that everybody can relate to.

485
00:21:23.719 --> 00:21:25.519
<v ->It's very true, and when you think about it,</v>

486
00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:29.019
it's often been said that when you want something,

487
00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:30.479
or you want to draw something to yourself,

488
00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:32.149
you have to let it go, right.

489
00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:35.719
And so in a sense, although that's very candor almost,

490
00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:38.499
in the way it's presented, there's, again

491
00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:42.709
it has the same common theme that you're releasing

492
00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:45.439
this painful kind of attachment,

493
00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:48.519
this painful kind of expectation,

494
00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:50.979
that human beings tend to hold on to,

495
00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:52.708
in order to achieve an outcome.

496
00:21:52.879 --> 00:21:54.869
I've just got to grind away at it.

497
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:57.449
Meaning, I have to work hard to get what I want.

498
00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.849
That's another world view though.

499
00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:01.049
<v ->Sure.</v>

500
00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:03.238
And this is the term that they use a lot

501
00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:06.089
in The Art of Soaring book, world view.

502
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.678
You know, we think that the way we

503
00:22:08.678 --> 00:22:11.168
see the world, is the world.

504
00:22:11.578 --> 00:22:15.518
But no, it's like we can be changing our operating system,

505
00:22:15.518 --> 00:22:18.237
and changing our glasses, and seeing the world

506
00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:21.157
in all the different lights and colors, etcetera.

507
00:22:21.157 --> 00:22:23.427
So it's really, matter of our choice.

508
00:22:23.477 --> 00:22:25.327
This is the amazing part of the book.

509
00:22:25.457 --> 00:22:28.575
That is made you laugh and realize that

510
00:22:28.575 --> 00:22:33.575
there is no insolvable problems,

511
00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:36.355
that there are no missions impossible,

512
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:39.494
that we are in charge of our own destiny,

513
00:22:39.494 --> 00:22:41.134
and we are always making the

514
00:22:41.134 --> 00:22:43.465
choice of what we want to manifest.

515
00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:45.715
So, if you say, oh I cannot do it.

516
00:22:45.715 --> 00:22:49.775
The circumstances are so dire, that I will be miserable

517
00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:52.775
for the rest of my life, well it's your choice.

518
00:22:52.775 --> 00:22:55.215
You are choosing to see yourself this way.

519
00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:57.464
And this is the reality that you choose for yourself.

520
00:22:57.814 --> 00:23:01.615
But these books of The Art of Soaring, the sequels that I am

521
00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:06.615
now working on, they're all about giving this understanding,

522
00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:09.635
that we all are the creators of our destiny,

523
00:23:09.635 --> 00:23:11.445
and we all have the choices.

524
00:23:11.794 --> 00:23:12.974
<v ->But it's done in so much more</v>

525
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:15.355
powerful and beautiful a way, than what

526
00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:17.814
we traditionally experience, looking, especially those

527
00:23:17.965 --> 00:23:19.664
who come through the scientific model

528
00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.315
of creating your own reality.

529
00:23:21.784 --> 00:23:24.204
It's getting in to holographic realities,

530
00:23:24.204 --> 00:23:27.100
and really you're talking about scientific parlance,

531
00:23:27.418 --> 00:23:28.658
which is very valuable.

532
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:33.298
It's wonderful that these mysteries, this magic,

533
00:23:33.298 --> 00:23:36.518
has essentially been unlocked and explained on

534
00:23:36.518 --> 00:23:37.678
certain levels, how we can

535
00:23:37.678 --> 00:23:39.468
create this reality, scientifically.

536
00:23:39.738 --> 00:23:42.798
But that doesn't unlock our emotional charges

537
00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:44.138
that we walk around with.

538
00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:46.238
<v ->It does not, and actually now today,</v>

539
00:23:46.238 --> 00:23:49.738
scientists are, I think they forgot that even Einstein

540
00:23:49.738 --> 00:23:51.638
was saying that imagination is

541
00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:53.168
more important than knowledge.

542
00:23:53.378 --> 00:23:53.858
<v ->Yes.</v>

543
00:23:53.858 --> 00:23:56.398
<v ->Can you believe, he felt that imagination,</v>

544
00:23:56.398 --> 00:23:59.758
and we all know that the greatest scientific discoveries

545
00:23:59.758 --> 00:24:03.738
become not through initializing, but in a flash,

546
00:24:03.738 --> 00:24:05.508
in a flash of inspiration,

547
00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:09.928
in a flash of awareness or insight.

548
00:24:10.678 --> 00:24:14.318
So imagination has such an important role to play

549
00:24:14.318 --> 00:24:16.128
even in science itself.

550
00:24:16.646 --> 00:24:17.226
<v ->Yes.</v>

551
00:24:17.226 --> 00:24:19.616
<v ->I have a doctoral degree, I have PHD,</v>

552
00:24:19.706 --> 00:24:21.986
but it doesn't prevent me from seeing that

553
00:24:21.986 --> 00:24:23.956
you know, science is a tool.

554
00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:28.306
It is just one of the tools to do

555
00:24:28.306 --> 00:24:30.076
certain things in our reality.

556
00:24:30.286 --> 00:24:32.126
But it's not all of reality.

557
00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:36.655
It's not the whole range of the tools that we can use.

558
00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:43.166
Arts and the imaginations, it's all that's accessible

559
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.536
to everybody.

560
00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:47.305
You know, the irony of it is, that we all have

561
00:24:47.305 --> 00:24:48.816
imagination within ourselves.

562
00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:51.766
But today, we have persuaded ourselves

563
00:24:51.766 --> 00:24:54.705
that only special people have imagination.

564
00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:56.526
The artist, they are the imagine,

565
00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:58.285
they, or those who make movies.

566
00:24:58.285 --> 00:25:01.075
So these are the people who can create

567
00:25:01.225 --> 00:25:03.885
all this imagery, and we are just the consumers

568
00:25:03.885 --> 00:25:05.454
of their imaginations.

569
00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:09.885
No, read the other story, try just one of the

570
00:25:09.885 --> 00:25:11.684
techniques, and you will see it,

571
00:25:11.684 --> 00:25:14.885
that you can create a more fascinating,

572
00:25:14.885 --> 00:25:19.185
movie within your own mind, than anything

573
00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:20.364
you've ever seen on screen.

574
00:25:20.364 --> 00:25:21.624
<v ->It's very true.</v>

575
00:25:21.624 --> 00:25:23.544
I kept practicing it, as I was reading.

576
00:25:23.544 --> 00:25:25.504
I thought, dude this is really fun,

577
00:25:25.504 --> 00:25:28.163
just to give yourself permission even,

578
00:25:28.163 --> 00:25:30.623
to become zany and insane in

579
00:25:30.623 --> 00:25:33.004
the way you're creating this world,

580
00:25:33.004 --> 00:25:35.774
this abundant world of whatever it is.

581
00:25:35.844 --> 00:25:38.654
Whether it's peace, joy, happiness, health, what not.

582
00:25:39.044 --> 00:25:41.484
<v ->True, and you know, these techniques can be used to</v>

583
00:25:41.484 --> 00:25:44.802
resolve any kind of issues, even health issues.

584
00:25:44.802 --> 00:25:46.073
<v ->I was just going to ask you.</v>

585
00:25:46.123 --> 00:25:47.023
Tell us about that.

586
00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:50.393
<v ->Yeah, so you know, what is the health issue?</v>

587
00:25:50.663 --> 00:25:52.234
Today we have an approach that

588
00:25:53.684 --> 00:25:55.633
health issue, or depression.

589
00:25:55.724 --> 00:26:00.704
So, some kind of disease of the flesh, or of our spirit,

590
00:26:00.704 --> 00:26:02.014
it's our enemy.

591
00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:04.014
We need to fight against it.

592
00:26:04.224 --> 00:26:08.024
So, surgery, or pain killers, anti-depressants.

593
00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:09.134
This is the solution.

594
00:26:09.343 --> 00:26:12.324
So we are fighting with the consequence,

595
00:26:12.324 --> 00:26:13.914
not with the real cause.

596
00:26:14.304 --> 00:26:17.784
But in the ancient world view, from which

597
00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:20.274
The Art of Soaring emerged,

598
00:26:21.164 --> 00:26:24.204
they were seeing a depression, the feeling

599
00:26:24.204 --> 00:26:26.094
that well, something is wrong,

600
00:26:26.624 --> 00:26:29.883
as not a disease, but as a signal

601
00:26:29.883 --> 00:26:32.724
that something is wrong with your lifestyle,

602
00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:35.304
with your world outlook, with your

603
00:26:35.304 --> 00:26:36.944
relationship to other world,

604
00:26:36.944 --> 00:26:38.934
with your diet, with something.

605
00:26:39.124 --> 00:26:42.203
So it was seen as a signal as an invitation

606
00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:46.414
to transcend this depressional bodily condition,

607
00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:48.784
and to move forward to the health existence.

608
00:26:48.784 --> 00:26:52.004
So instead of taking pain killers, or anti-depressants,

609
00:26:52.004 --> 00:26:54.303
The Art of Soaring shows some very efficient

610
00:26:54.303 --> 00:26:57.163
techniques of actually thanking,

611
00:26:57.163 --> 00:26:59.923
thanking this disease, or thanking this feeling

612
00:26:59.923 --> 00:27:02.593
of depression for coming to you,

613
00:27:02.683 --> 00:27:05.123
and reminding you that there-

614
00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.382
<v ->Maybe you've gone out of balance.</v>

615
00:27:06.382 --> 00:27:07.223
<v ->Exactly
<v ->Yeah.</v>

616
00:27:07.223 --> 00:27:09.223
<v ->And so this very simple technique,</v>

617
00:27:09.223 --> 00:27:13.393
is to thank and to give your depression a gift.

618
00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:16.442
So, dear mister depression, thank you very much

619
00:27:16.442 --> 00:27:19.973
for spending so much of your valuable time with me.

620
00:27:20.462 --> 00:27:24.713
So I thank you profusely, and I give you this gift.

621
00:27:25.063 --> 00:27:28.613
And imagine something that would make you love inside.

622
00:27:28.663 --> 00:27:31.153
And people come up with all kinds of

623
00:27:34.263 --> 00:27:35.433
like, imagery.

624
00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:37.903
One lady, she was struggling with depression,

625
00:27:37.903 --> 00:27:41.513
and she wrote me, she wrote a small poem, a song.

626
00:27:41.823 --> 00:27:45.192
And the song was, I'm a pregnant Barbie doll.

627
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:51.761
So she gave her depression this gift, a CD produced

628
00:27:51.761 --> 00:27:54.321
with her song, I'm a pregnant Barbie doll,

629
00:27:54.321 --> 00:27:56.211
flying on a hairy balloon.

630
00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.021
So I thought, what, there it is.

631
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:00.340
But this released her tension, and she saw

632
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.221
that where anti-depressants could do nothing,

633
00:28:03.221 --> 00:28:05.701
all of a sudden, in a flash, in five minutes,

634
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:08.591
she resolved the whole issue on it's own within herself.

635
00:28:08.841 --> 00:28:10.411
<v ->It's just beautiful.</v>

636
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:12.761
Now one of the things he was talking about in the book,

637
00:28:12.761 --> 00:28:15.490
is they're still in the theoretical stage, setting it up.

638
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.870
They used the analogy of gamer, a video gamer.

639
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.500
And I thought that was quite interesting,

640
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.700
because he was talking about that really

641
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.790
rarefied strata of video gamers who are are called divers.

642
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.478
You remember that part?

643
00:28:28.478 --> 00:28:29.198
<v ->Absolutely.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

644
00:28:29.198 --> 00:28:31.278
And he's talking about
<v ->Who can be totally immersed</v>

645
00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:33.838
in the game, yet remember somewhere

646
00:28:33.838 --> 00:28:36.348
in their subconscious that it is still a game.

647
00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:37.998
<v ->It's still a game, and this is the,</v>

648
00:28:37.998 --> 00:28:41.398
this is really what a lot of the lovely

649
00:28:41.398 --> 00:28:43.318
eastern philosophies talk about,

650
00:28:43.318 --> 00:28:45.648
of being the one who observes being aware,

651
00:28:45.738 --> 00:28:47.058
being the awareness at the same

652
00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:49.868
time you're involved in the dance, so to speak.

653
00:28:50.118 --> 00:28:53.298
And they talk about, this is an important element

654
00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:54.906
to have almost a,

655
00:28:56.176 --> 00:28:57.696
it's not a dual type of awareness,

656
00:28:57.696 --> 00:28:59.615
but in this expanded awareness,

657
00:28:59.615 --> 00:29:00.676
while you're playing the game,

658
00:29:00.676 --> 00:29:03.566
and that helps in not taking things so seriously as well.

659
00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:05.836
<v ->True, and you know I feel today with our</v>

660
00:29:05.836 --> 00:29:08.056
computer technology, we start seeing

661
00:29:08.056 --> 00:29:12.335
all kind of parallels between how

662
00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:14.175
computers work, and how our minds are bred.

663
00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:14.935
<v ->Yes.</v>

664
00:29:14.935 --> 00:29:16.575
<v ->Look, computers have viruses,</v>

665
00:29:16.575 --> 00:29:18.995
and they can become sick, and they can have

666
00:29:18.995 --> 00:29:21.135
hard drive failure, on all these things

667
00:29:21.135 --> 00:29:22.925
that we can suffer from too.

668
00:29:23.215 --> 00:29:25.214
And this parallel with the computer world

669
00:29:25.214 --> 00:29:28.795
starts helping to remind people

670
00:29:28.795 --> 00:29:31.625
that we can become our own programmers.

671
00:29:31.955 --> 00:29:34.235
Instead of buying an operating system

672
00:29:34.235 --> 00:29:36.835
from some software manufacturing company,

673
00:29:36.835 --> 00:29:37.694
and being.
<v ->Pre-programmed.</v>

674
00:29:37.694 --> 00:29:40.133
<v ->Hell yeah, pre-programmed, and then having</v>

675
00:29:40.133 --> 00:29:42.473
to download security patches,

676
00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:44.394
and everything on a daily basis,

677
00:29:44.394 --> 00:29:47.014
we can become creators of our own

678
00:29:47.014 --> 00:29:50.133
operative system, we can rise above the problem,

679
00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:53.624
the social conditioning, that when we went through

680
00:29:53.994 --> 00:29:56.764
and outlines we can become the creators of our reality.

681
00:29:56.853 --> 00:29:59.043
Actually, you know I have a friend who

682
00:29:59.473 --> 00:30:02.713
has a PHD in biology, and he has been studying

683
00:30:02.713 --> 00:30:05.003
the cognitive abilities of mammals.

684
00:30:05.213 --> 00:30:07.733
And one day he asked me, Leo, do you know

685
00:30:07.733 --> 00:30:10.943
what's the difference between a rat and a human being?

686
00:30:11.373 --> 00:30:13.132
I said, you know, I never really thought about it,

687
00:30:13.132 --> 00:30:15.363
but now that you ask, I'm not really sure.

688
00:30:15.632 --> 00:30:17.063
And he's like, I'll tell you.

689
00:30:17.193 --> 00:30:18.172
Here's the difference.

690
00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:21.684
He was making a larger cardboard maze.

691
00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:24.653
And he would put a rat inside this maze,

692
00:30:24.653 --> 00:30:27.864
and he would hide a piece of cheese in one corner.

693
00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:32.053
And he would see how much time it would take the rat

694
00:30:32.053 --> 00:30:33.164
to find this cheese.

695
00:30:33.213 --> 00:30:36.364
So on the first day, it takes 15 seconds.

696
00:30:36.614 --> 00:30:38.314
On the second day, and he puts it

697
00:30:38.314 --> 00:30:39.584
in the same corner.

698
00:30:39.794 --> 00:30:41.164
It takes 10 seconds.

699
00:30:41.234 --> 00:30:43.393
On the third day, it takes just five seconds,

700
00:30:43.393 --> 00:30:44.773
because the rat starts to remember,

701
00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:47.963
this is the path to the cheese, and just rushes there.

702
00:30:48.273 --> 00:30:51.133
On the fourth day, he would place the piece of cheese in

703
00:30:51.133 --> 00:30:52.703
a different corner of the maze.

704
00:30:53.073 --> 00:30:55.373
So the rat would rush to the corner where

705
00:30:55.373 --> 00:30:57.063
the cheese was the previous night.

706
00:30:57.313 --> 00:31:00.493
Cannot find the cheese, all dumbfounded.

707
00:31:00.493 --> 00:31:03.426
But then, five seconds later, becomes active,

708
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:05.706
and searching, and looking for the cheese,

709
00:31:05.706 --> 00:31:08.896
eventually finds this piece of cheese, and there it eats it.

710
00:31:09.105 --> 00:31:10.865
So he told me, here is the difference

711
00:31:10.865 --> 00:31:12.855
between a rat and a human being.

712
00:31:13.325 --> 00:31:16.585
When the rat doesn't come, the cheese where it used to be,

713
00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:18.045
where it was the previous night,

714
00:31:18.045 --> 00:31:20.495
it becomes active, it does something about it.

715
00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.965
And humans seem to be the only creatures

716
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:27.344
on the planet, who after not find a piece of

717
00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:29.425
cheese where it used to be, they will be

718
00:31:29.425 --> 00:31:31.675
just sitting there, and complaining.

719
00:31:31.925 --> 00:31:35.065
And inventing entire religious theories

720
00:31:35.065 --> 00:31:38.764
about how they transgressed in previous lives,

721
00:31:38.764 --> 00:31:41.574
and this is why the cheese was taken away from them.

722
00:31:41.824 --> 00:31:43.964
So this is what he's inside, that had got from

723
00:31:43.964 --> 00:31:46.774
observing the behavior of mice and rats.

724
00:31:46.844 --> 00:31:49.005
They do not have this kind of programming.

725
00:31:49.005 --> 00:31:50.195
They are open minded.

726
00:31:50.525 --> 00:31:53.215
No cheese, not a big deal, I'll find it elsewhere.

727
00:31:53.665 --> 00:31:57.764
And we are overlaying the reality,

728
00:31:57.764 --> 00:32:00.754
what really is in the world, in our experience.

729
00:32:00.965 --> 00:32:04.485
We're adding so much of our own ideas

730
00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:07.745
to it, that it becomes really a jungle.

731
00:32:07.745 --> 00:32:08.865
We cannot find our way

732
00:32:08.865 --> 00:32:09.645
through it.
<v ->Yes.</v>

733
00:32:09.645 --> 00:32:12.764
<v ->So The Art of Soaring is this amazing technique</v>

734
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.925
of rising above the jungle, and seeing,

735
00:32:14.925 --> 00:32:18.284
aha, this is where I was going, this is what

736
00:32:18.284 --> 00:32:20.135
reality is really all about.

737
00:32:20.165 --> 00:32:21.745
<v ->Yes, and they even talk about there.</v>

738
00:32:21.745 --> 00:32:22.461
Where you were just saying

739
00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:23.501
oh I have to rise above.

740
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:26.220
They even talk about the subject of karma in this book.

741
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.780
<v ->True.</v>

742
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.960
<v ->But it's not the way we would think of it,</v>

743
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.100
as something you have to pay a penance for,

744
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.500
grinding through, or something in much of the

745
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.030
parlance that exists right now.

746
00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.859
They're talking about it in a much more light hearted way.

747
00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:41.360
Can you talk about their view of karma?

748
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.440
<v ->Absolutely.
<v ->And dealing with it.</v>

749
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.100
<v ->Mm, hmm.</v>

750
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.460
You know, and the amazing part is,

751
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.426
that what they're talking about, is not new.

752
00:32:49.016 --> 00:32:52.777
They are referring to some ancient parables, etcetera,

753
00:32:52.777 --> 00:32:55.117
that show that even our ancestors knew

754
00:32:55.117 --> 00:32:57.437
that there are ways of overcoming karma,

755
00:32:57.437 --> 00:33:01.457
or overcoming all kinds of problems, light heartedly.

756
00:33:01.457 --> 00:33:03.037
For example, they give an example of

757
00:33:03.037 --> 00:33:08.037
an ancient story when a man was, a peasant was

758
00:33:09.177 --> 00:33:11.417
making love to a neighbor's wife,

759
00:33:11.417 --> 00:33:14.286
and so the Shiva God, passing on,

760
00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:19.015
passing by, and asked, oh Shiva,

761
00:33:19.015 --> 00:33:21.235
tell me how many more inclinations do I

762
00:33:21.235 --> 00:33:22.865
have in this flesh?

763
00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:25.685
And he said, well you have ten inclinations left.

764
00:33:26.435 --> 00:33:27.815
And he was overjoyed that it was

765
00:33:27.815 --> 00:33:31.215
just ten inclinations left of suffering,

766
00:33:31.215 --> 00:33:33.605
that he become enlightened the same moment.

767
00:33:33.814 --> 00:33:36.250
So here is an ancient story here, that conveys

768
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.280
the understanding that we we're not locked up in our karma.

769
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.220
So they have the same approach.

770
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.930
If you seriously believe in karma,

771
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.510
you keep maintaining your karma with the energy

772
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.809
of your thought.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

773
00:33:49.809 --> 00:33:51.249
<v ->You are creating your karma,</v>

774
00:33:51.249 --> 00:33:53.830
you are giving it the existence by

775
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.089
believing that, yeah, I need to work with it,

776
00:33:57.089 --> 00:33:59.719
I need to be good, I have like that many more

777
00:33:59.719 --> 00:34:01.129
life times to go.

778
00:34:01.398 --> 00:34:05.808
So you are all locked up, but you are your own prisoner.

779
00:34:06.318 --> 00:34:08.178
And they present all this beautiful,

780
00:34:08.178 --> 00:34:10.639
light hearted approaches, of how you realize,

781
00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:13.899
that yes, karma is just one operating system.

782
00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:15.909
It's one world view, it's one image.

783
00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:17.559
But I'm the one who is in charge

784
00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:20.369
of all the movies played in this theater.

785
00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:22.359
So why don't I play another movie,

786
00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:25.288
where I can just resolve all my karmic

787
00:34:25.819 --> 00:34:26.839
<v ->There you go, it's a choice.
<v ->circumstances</v>

788
00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:27.518
in five minutes.

789
00:34:27.518 --> 00:34:27.918
<v ->Yeah.</v>

790
00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:28.908
<v ->There it is.</v>

791
00:34:28.938 --> 00:34:30.008
<v ->Oh, it's beautiful.</v>

792
00:34:30.218 --> 00:34:33.928
Well, I like that so much better.

793
00:34:34.738 --> 00:34:36.998
What about the notion of becoming a healer?

794
00:34:36.998 --> 00:34:40.975
Because they talk to the person that's reading this,

795
00:34:40.975 --> 00:34:45.975
that really wants to be a part of the journey of others

796
00:34:46.174 --> 00:34:48.024
in going through this healing process.

797
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:49.834
And yet we judge ourselves for that.

798
00:34:49.834 --> 00:34:52.074
Oh, I don't know that it was really me

799
00:34:52.074 --> 00:34:53.604
that really had that effect and so forth.

800
00:34:53.734 --> 00:34:55.504
How did you perceive that?

801
00:34:55.734 --> 00:34:57.053
<v ->Yeah, talking about healers,</v>

802
00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:58.374
you know what I like also about

803
00:34:58.374 --> 00:35:00.654
The Art of Soaring book, is that the authors

804
00:35:00.654 --> 00:35:03.854
are not serious about anything, including themselves.

805
00:35:03.854 --> 00:35:04.434
<v ->Yes.</v>

806
00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:08.994
<v ->They do not present themselves as someone special,</v>

807
00:35:08.994 --> 00:35:11.254
someone who knew the way, and now is

808
00:35:11.254 --> 00:35:15.084
enlightened past the ignorant, or people.

809
00:35:15.214 --> 00:35:17.414
No, they are very light hearted, they are playful,

810
00:35:17.414 --> 00:35:20.414
and where the healing, they practicing healing themselves,

811
00:35:20.414 --> 00:35:23.594
they are healers, they help people overcome

812
00:35:23.594 --> 00:35:27.653
bodily disease, and all kinds of life challenges

813
00:35:27.653 --> 00:35:29.964
through the techniques described in The Art of Soaring.

814
00:35:30.174 --> 00:35:32.334
But they explain that, you know,

815
00:35:32.334 --> 00:35:35.514
we in this world, we tend to rely on

816
00:35:35.514 --> 00:35:37.924
somebody else for everything.

817
00:35:38.153 --> 00:35:40.653
Somebody else is raising our children

818
00:35:40.653 --> 00:35:41.934
and giving then education.

819
00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:43.294
Somebody's growing our food.

820
00:35:43.294 --> 00:35:45.514
Somebody's building our home.

821
00:35:45.514 --> 00:35:47.974
Somebody, even in the spiritual realm,

822
00:35:47.974 --> 00:35:51.154
we have somebody who is enlightening us.

823
00:35:51.154 --> 00:35:54.144
Somebody who is healing us, somebody who is saving us.

824
00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:57.093
And they remind us that we can all

825
00:35:57.093 --> 00:36:00.654
become our own healers, and actually the reason why

826
00:36:00.654 --> 00:36:03.934
we can be healed so easily, if we come to a healer

827
00:36:03.934 --> 00:36:06.014
who has this power, is because we have

828
00:36:06.014 --> 00:36:07.703
the faith in the healer.

829
00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:10.214
We have the faith that this particular person

830
00:36:10.214 --> 00:36:13.483
can finally help us, where everybody else failed.

831
00:36:13.774 --> 00:36:17.574
And your faith in this person is what heals you.

832
00:36:17.574 --> 00:36:18.014
<v ->Yes.</v>

833
00:36:18.014 --> 00:36:19.164
<v ->Most and foremost.</v>

834
00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:22.294
So instead of relying on somebody else

835
00:36:22.294 --> 00:36:24.374
for your fulfillment, they say,

836
00:36:24.374 --> 00:36:28.053
well if you have as much faith in yourself,

837
00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:30.034
in your abilities, in your imagination,

838
00:36:30.034 --> 00:36:32.394
as you have in somebody else's

839
00:36:32.394 --> 00:36:35.964
this will be your healing, instantaneously.

840
00:36:36.134 --> 00:36:38.133
<v ->Absolutely, and in the western medical model,</v>

841
00:36:38.133 --> 00:36:41.833
oh no, double blank study, that was just a placebo affect.

842
00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:43.124
Yippie!

843
00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:44.424
Isn't that great news?

844
00:36:44.424 --> 00:36:44.823
<v ->Yeah.</v>

845
00:36:44.823 --> 00:36:47.533
<v ->You know, we all have that capability on our own.</v>

846
00:36:47.533 --> 00:36:50.213
You don't need the drug, you don't need the doctor.

847
00:36:50.213 --> 00:36:51.363
You don't need the intervention.

848
00:36:51.513 --> 00:36:53.903
In most cases, in many cases certainly.

849
00:36:54.073 --> 00:36:55.393
So they really approach it from

850
00:36:55.393 --> 00:36:59.152
the ground level of your own, internal belief system,

851
00:36:59.152 --> 00:37:00.602
that's what healing is about.

852
00:37:00.931 --> 00:37:03.450
<v ->True, and again, we are not just talking about</v>

853
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.370
the bodily healing, we are talking about

854
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.680
healing our relationships, and money problems.

855
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.210
I know, one of the ladies tried this technique.

856
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.300
She was struggling with her mortgage bills.

857
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.590
And then she played out this negative scenario.

858
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.690
So now the technique described in The Art of Soaring,

859
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.830
instead of struggling with an issue,

860
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.270
release it and play out in your mind,

861
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.630
the most negative scenario you can think of

862
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.060
until it becomes absurd.

863
00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.950
So she imagined that she will become bankrupt,

864
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.890
and will be thrown out of her home,

865
00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.740
with no possessions or anything.

866
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.010
So she will spend the rest of her life,

867
00:37:37.668 --> 00:37:39.679
living under the bridge in Chicago.

868
00:37:40.048 --> 00:37:40.508
<v ->Under a bridge.</v>

869
00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:43.429
<v ->And policing the sidewalks looking for</v>

870
00:37:43.429 --> 00:37:45.319
a banana skin to chew on.

871
00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:48.029
And she created this amazing vision

872
00:37:48.029 --> 00:37:51.089
where she will collect all banana skins in the world

873
00:37:51.089 --> 00:37:52.158
to subsist on.

874
00:37:52.468 --> 00:37:54.708
And then even extraterrestrials will be

875
00:37:54.708 --> 00:37:57.609
sending the space ships in the form of bananas

876
00:37:57.609 --> 00:38:00.639
filled with banana skins for her to chew on.

877
00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:03.069
So when she arrived at this vision,

878
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:07.208
this absolute comical, or exaggerated parable,

879
00:38:07.208 --> 00:38:10.268
she could no longer be serious about the bills

880
00:38:10.268 --> 00:38:11.458
that come in the mail.

881
00:38:11.768 --> 00:38:14.149
And she explained that like, the problem disappeared.

882
00:38:14.149 --> 00:38:17.589
All of a sudden, her money situation improved,

883
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:20.029
just because instead of sitting there and worrying,

884
00:38:20.029 --> 00:38:23.609
and seeing herself as a victim who will be

885
00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:26.228
struggling with her bills for the rest of her life,

886
00:38:26.228 --> 00:38:29.379
all of a sudden she changed her perception of herself.

887
00:38:29.689 --> 00:38:31.979
As it says in the book, she renamed herself.

888
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:35.189
Instead of saying, I am the one who has

889
00:38:35.189 --> 00:38:39.229
mortgage payment problems, she told,

890
00:38:39.229 --> 00:38:42.129
I am the one who is receiving food aid

891
00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:44.418
of banana skins from aliens.

892
00:38:45.126 --> 00:38:47.627
And you know, because the one who is receiving

893
00:38:47.627 --> 00:38:49.787
food aid of banana skins from aliens

894
00:38:49.787 --> 00:38:53.277
certainly cannot have any mortgage bill problems, right?

895
00:38:54.567 --> 00:38:56.847
So the problem disappeared on its own.

896
00:38:56.847 --> 00:38:57.667
<v ->I love it.</v>

897
00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.044
And the book is filled with with that.

898
00:38:59.044 --> 00:39:01.644
Really, the second it happens, nothing but will.

899
00:39:01.644 --> 00:39:04.715
The two thirds of it is nothing but this kind of story.

900
00:39:05.085 --> 00:39:07.044
I mean not that one, but a lot of stories like this.

901
00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:09.824
So you can see, it gives you a nice portrait of

902
00:39:09.824 --> 00:39:12.294
someone who comes in with a lot of complex issues.

903
00:39:12.384 --> 00:39:13.974
There's one man in here in particular.

904
00:39:14.144 --> 00:39:17.953
How one of the authors worked with him,

905
00:39:18.024 --> 00:39:22.164
little bit at a time, to just allow the tension

906
00:39:22.164 --> 00:39:23.944
to be released in one little area,

907
00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:25.374
with one little remembrance.

908
00:39:25.384 --> 00:39:27.184
And then renaming, and then this

909
00:39:27.184 --> 00:39:28.624
thanksgiving process.

910
00:39:28.624 --> 00:39:31.884
And so we're, until they wound down to the very base

911
00:39:32.383 --> 00:39:34.592
of what was, had really happened in his life,

912
00:39:34.662 --> 00:39:36.933
and this rediscovery and re-framing of it.

913
00:39:37.043 --> 00:39:39.693
And his, essentially everything else healed.

914
00:39:40.623 --> 00:39:41.623
The whole thing, the whole mechanism

915
00:39:41.623 --> 00:39:42.862
his whole being healed.
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

916
00:39:42.862 --> 00:39:44.822
And you know, what I also noticed,

917
00:39:44.822 --> 00:39:47.022
just by observing even my children,

918
00:39:47.022 --> 00:39:49.622
I noticed that they know this Art of Soaring

919
00:39:49.622 --> 00:39:51.302
without reading this book.

920
00:39:51.302 --> 00:39:53.642
They all have this playful attitude.

921
00:39:53.642 --> 00:39:56.082
And she finds me doing that,

922
00:39:56.082 --> 00:39:58.432
and asks, daddy, what are you doing?

923
00:39:58.502 --> 00:40:00.422
I said, well I saw your doll broke,

924
00:40:00.422 --> 00:40:03.052
and so I'm trying to see how I can fix it.

925
00:40:03.882 --> 00:40:08.332
And she said, yeah my little sister broke it.

926
00:40:09.422 --> 00:40:11.452
But you don't have to fix it, she says.

927
00:40:11.702 --> 00:40:12.671
I said why?

928
00:40:12.801 --> 00:40:13.931
And she showed me this.

929
00:40:14.022 --> 00:40:17.751
She said, daddy, because it's not a Barbie doll.

930
00:40:19.782 --> 00:40:21.952
She did like, it's a giraffe.

931
00:40:22.882 --> 00:40:24.412
And not only that, she told me,

932
00:40:24.561 --> 00:40:28.852
daddy, it was always a giraffe, not a Barbie doll.

933
00:40:28.902 --> 00:40:31.672
Only, the head was attached to the wrong place.

934
00:40:33.382 --> 00:40:37.018
So I know, it's this art of seeing a giraffe

935
00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:38.038
<v ->Look at that.</v>

936
00:40:38.038 --> 00:40:41.259
<v ->where everybody else would see a broken Barbie doll.</v>

937
00:40:41.259 --> 00:40:41.808
<v ->I love it.</v>

938
00:40:41.808 --> 00:40:43.669
<v ->And our children have that.</v>

939
00:40:43.698 --> 00:40:46.059
It's just inbuilt in our being,

940
00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:47.209
the moment we are born.

941
00:40:47.439 --> 00:40:49.839
So The Art of Soaring is not about

942
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:52.279
the discovering a new system, a new philosophy.

943
00:40:52.279 --> 00:40:56.319
It's about reclaiming this pristine purity of perception

944
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:57.989
that we are all born with.

945
00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.817
<v ->Reclaiming our own fairy tale.</v>

946
00:40:59.817 --> 00:41:00.357
<v ->Yeah.</v>

947
00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.827
<v ->That is beautiful.</v>

948
00:41:02.357 --> 00:41:05.397
Well, on that note, I think it's best if

949
00:41:05.397 --> 00:41:08.717
everybody just, that's interested, just pick up a copy

950
00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:09.137
of the book.

951
00:41:09.137 --> 00:41:10.207
Where can they get this?

952
00:41:10.637 --> 00:41:11.457
Where's The Art of Soaring?
<v ->They can get it on</v>

953
00:41:11.457 --> 00:41:15.017
the deepsnowpress.com website.

954
00:41:15.017 --> 00:41:16.776
<v ->deepsnowpress.com.</v>

955
00:41:16.776 --> 00:41:18.157
Okay.
<v ->On the publisher's website.</v>

956
00:41:18.157 --> 00:41:21.117
deepshowpress.com.

957
00:41:21.117 --> 00:41:23.177
<v ->Okay, how long has this been available to the English</v>

958
00:41:23.177 --> 00:41:24.127
speaking audience?

959
00:41:24.537 --> 00:41:25.417
<v ->Two months.</v>

960
00:41:25.417 --> 00:41:26.516
<v ->Two months, brand new, whoah.</v>

961
00:41:26.516 --> 00:41:28.126
Yes, I'm one of the first, I love it.

962
00:41:28.836 --> 00:41:31.096
Okay, well Leonid, it's so wonderful

963
00:41:31.096 --> 00:41:32.436
to talk about this with you.

964
00:41:32.436 --> 00:41:34.636
And also, another thing that you're getting

965
00:41:34.636 --> 00:41:36.596
ready to involve yourself with, which I've been

966
00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:40.556
fascinated with, very much since we've first met,

967
00:41:40.556 --> 00:41:45.166
is the school in Russia, which is really.

968
00:41:45.476 --> 00:41:49.456
I mean, I'm so enthralled with the notion where

969
00:41:49.456 --> 00:41:52.016
the children create the curriculum.

970
00:41:52.016 --> 00:41:54.296
The children build the facilities,

971
00:41:54.296 --> 00:41:57.896
and supply all of the artwork for the place.

972
00:41:57.896 --> 00:42:00.616
And work with gardens and learn movement

973
00:42:00.616 --> 00:42:03.286
that we have long lost in our beings.

974
00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:05.376
And this beautiful environment.

975
00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:06.756
You said again, Tekos?

976
00:42:06.756 --> 00:42:07.656
The Tekos School?

977
00:42:07.656 --> 00:42:10.034
<v ->The Teckos School in southern Russia.</v>

978
00:42:10.034 --> 00:42:11.374
<v ->And you're going, when you go back to Russia,</v>

979
00:42:11.374 --> 00:42:12.594
you're going to be involved in this.

980
00:42:12.594 --> 00:42:13.914
And I don't I shouldn't make promises,

981
00:42:13.914 --> 00:42:15.834
I might not be able to keep, but our intention

982
00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:18.414
right now, is in a few months when we go there,

983
00:42:18.414 --> 00:42:21.913
you and I, and Scott are going to hook up together,

984
00:42:21.913 --> 00:42:24.114
and we're going to go to the school,

985
00:42:24.114 --> 00:42:26.654
and we're going to talk with the headmaster

986
00:42:26.654 --> 00:42:27.804
and some of the students.

987
00:42:28.154 --> 00:42:29.934
<v ->Yeah, I very much look forward to it.</v>

988
00:42:29.934 --> 00:42:32.114
Because I visited this school myself,

989
00:42:32.114 --> 00:42:33.744
with my daughter a few months ago.

990
00:42:34.054 --> 00:42:36.914
And it's literally like entering the fourth dimension.

991
00:42:36.914 --> 00:42:37.394
<v ->Yes.</v>

992
00:42:37.394 --> 00:42:40.404
<v ->Because it's not even just about the children there.</v>

993
00:42:40.534 --> 00:42:44.504
It's about what they manifest as their abilities.

994
00:42:44.594 --> 00:42:47.384
They remind us all that we have all this infant abilities.

995
00:42:47.554 --> 00:42:49.914
The children have designed, built,

996
00:42:49.914 --> 00:42:51.704
and created their own campus.

997
00:42:52.662 --> 00:42:54.042
They do it free hand.

998
00:42:54.042 --> 00:42:55.983
All this amazing murals you see

999
00:42:55.983 --> 00:42:57.343
there in the school, the creation.

1000
00:42:57.343 --> 00:43:00.583
They were not even traced with a pencil on the wall,

1001
00:43:00.583 --> 00:43:03.443
because it's an understanding of the principle,

1002
00:43:03.443 --> 00:43:05.403
that if you tell the child, oh you need first

1003
00:43:05.403 --> 00:43:10.403
to practice, it conveys your skepticism.

1004
00:43:11.063 --> 00:43:12.343
You believe that oh, the child is not

1005
00:43:12.343 --> 00:43:14.333
capable of doing it freehand.

1006
00:43:14.623 --> 00:43:16.383
So instead, the principal is giving them

1007
00:43:16.383 --> 00:43:18.173
the brushes, says do it.

1008
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.388
<v ->It's beautiful.
<v ->Like, create it.</v>

1009
00:43:20.558 --> 00:43:24.158
And because he has this faith in education

1010
00:43:24.158 --> 00:43:27.857
being, not stuffing children's heads with information,

1011
00:43:27.857 --> 00:43:30.057
but rather creating an environment

1012
00:43:30.057 --> 00:43:32.717
in which they can blossom and draw out all

1013
00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:35.058
this creativity, and powers and abilities

1014
00:43:35.058 --> 00:43:36.548
that we are all born with.

1015
00:43:37.098 --> 00:43:40.748
So they were able to create this very magic space.

1016
00:43:40.978 --> 00:43:43.537
And the guy believed, it will redefine

1017
00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:48.217
the way we see education, and the way we raise our children,

1018
00:43:48.217 --> 00:43:49.387
the world over.

1019
00:43:49.457 --> 00:43:51.457
<v ->I felt that way, just watching the DVD of it.</v>

1020
00:43:51.457 --> 00:43:52.797
Even being removed

1021
00:43:53.835 --> 00:43:56.226
and connected by say technology,

1022
00:43:56.295 --> 00:43:58.645
You can feel the essence of that coming through.

1023
00:43:58.955 --> 00:44:00.215
We're going to set our intention

1024
00:44:00.215 --> 00:44:02.125
to do everything we can to be there with you.

1025
00:44:02.555 --> 00:44:04.575
<v ->Yeah, thank you Regina, thank you Scott,</v>

1026
00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:07.735
and yeah I would like to reach everybody

1027
00:44:07.735 --> 00:44:09.545
who is watching this broadcast.

1028
00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:12.153
Happy Soaring!

1029
00:44:12.153 --> 00:44:13.563
(laughs)

1030
00:44:14.673 --> 00:44:15.953
<v ->For those of you who would like to purchase</v>

1031
00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.714

more satisfying life experience.

1035
00:44:24.793 --> 00:44:26.993
Meanwhile, you might also be interested in our first

1036
00:44:26.993 --> 00:44:29.113
interview with Leonid, regarding the story of

1037
00:44:29.113 --> 00:44:32.233
Anastasia, another beautiful and profound view

1038
00:44:32.233 --> 00:44:34.203
of the potential of the human being.

1039
00:44:34.353 --> 00:44:36.772
Until next time, than you for watching CMN.

1040
00:44:36.772 --> 00:44:39.822
(calm music)
