00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:03.516
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.031
<v ->Last month we spoke with Sheila Gillette</v>

3
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:16.567
about her personal journey in becoming

4
00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.446
a channel for the Theo group of archangels.

5
00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:22.785
In this interview, I speak with the Theo group directly.

6
00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.513
They shared information about some of

7
00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:26.806
the energetic challenges facing mankind

8
00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:28.481
and what can be done to help manage them

9
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.488
and what life will be like in the future

10
00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:33.408
when we move in mass into the finer

11
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:36.453
fifth dimensional field.

12
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.231
<v ->Sheila, it's good to be back with you again</v>

13
00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:50.047
and this time we're going to go in it,

14
00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:52.202
you're going to go in it and we're going to begin

15
00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:57.202
talking with Theo which is the group of the 12 beings

16
00:00:57.737 --> 00:01:01.470
that come through and speak collectively as one voice

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.028
through you.

18
00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:06.974
<v ->Yes, I've been doing this 40 years</v>

19
00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:11.294
and Theo is a group of 12 archangels that speak

20
00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:13.128
through me.

21
00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:15.699
It is a voice, they take over my vocal chords

22
00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:18.216
and they speak directly to you and answer the questions

23
00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:19.741
of the questioner.

24
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.256
<v Regina>And they have a very, it's a very</v>

25
00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:24.616
interesting accent, just to give people the heads up

26
00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:27.730
in advance because it is almost as though

27
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.077
each of the syllables is being articulated

28
00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:31.442
out of a dictionary.

29
00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:35.602
It has a bit of initially kind of a robotic kind of sound

30
00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:37.511
in the very beginning and then starts softening

31
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:41.031
as they start working with the energies here

32
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:44.188
over as the minutes go on it starts softening,

33
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:46.908
but it's a very distinct accent to them.

34
00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:49.393
<v ->Yes and you know I asked about that accent</v>

35
00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:52.507
because and others had to, where are they from?

36
00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.086
What's the accent?

37
00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:57.360
And I said, they've not been embodied here

38
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.656
and so we asked them, where does

39
00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:02.437
the accent come from?

40
00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:06.042
And they said because they are aligned with

41
00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:10.597
all of the energies around us and sound is a part

42
00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.890
of that and our voices are the sound

43
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.122
so they bring forth those sounds and it comes

44
00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:18.650
out in that type of accent.

45
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.204
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

46
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:20.484
<v ->Which is a vibrational frequency.</v>

47
00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:22.852
<v Regina>But it's very clear so there will be</v>

48
00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:25.519
no problem with anybody understanding anything.

49
00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.540
So with that in mind, my intention today

50
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.251
is to talk with Theo about a larger picture.

51
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.971
About what's happening to mankind right now

52
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.478
at this transition point.

53
00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:41.752
Very strange and interesting phenomena are occuring

54
00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:43.843
within us and around us and that will be

55
00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:45.347
the nature of the conversation.

56
00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:49.506
So with that, we'll invite Theo to join us.

57
00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:51.501
<v ->Fine, it just takes a few seconds for me</v>

58
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:52.482
to alter my state.

59
00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:55.106
I'll close my eyes and I'll invite Theo to come in

60
00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:57.730
and they'll begin speaking and they'll say

61
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.959
this is the beginning is it not?

62
00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.050
And that's when we start with the questions.

63
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Regina>Okay, very good.</v>

64
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.161
We'll see you in a little bit.

65
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:07.397
<v ->Okay, bye for now.</v>

66
00:03:07.397 --> 00:03:09.388
It is the beginning, is it not?

67
00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:11.574
<v Regina>Yes, thank you Theo for agreeing</v>

68
00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:14.220
to join us here today and I'm asking questions

69
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.262
on behalf of many others around the world right now.

70
00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:23.254
And many beings are very intrigued with,

71
00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:26.955
flumoxed by and interested in what is happening

72
00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:30.187
on this planet within the physical body,

73
00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:32.554
the psyche, and so forth in relationship

74
00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:34.613
to the changes that are going on cosmically

75
00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:37.727
within the earth and I would like to start with

76
00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.671
one question that's off topic first.

77
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:43.999
And that is if you can give us an idea from

78
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.295
your perspective what it's like viewing into

79
00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:50.847
or reaching into the earth energies,

80
00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:52.500
though I know you and Sheila hook up

81
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.377
at a higher level than that.

82
00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:56.372
Can you tell us from an outside perspective

83
00:03:56.372 --> 00:04:01.267
what it is we're living in here and what it feels like?

84
00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:04.478
<v ->It is a high intensity, it is a high frequency</v>

85
00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:06.376
that is the fifth dimension area energy

86
00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:09.981
which is an arching up of the electromagnetic fields

87
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:13.042
of the earth and of the beings on it.

88
00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:17.384
Animals, humans, whatever is a part of this

89
00:04:17.384 --> 00:04:22.258
earthly experience is being affected

90
00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:26.044
by this energy frequency shift.

91
00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:28.828
It is an arching up of this energy so that beings

92
00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:33.543
are more conscious and aware energetically

93
00:04:33.543 --> 00:04:37.052
and aligned to their masterhood.

94
00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:39.739
Know that humans have come from trumonic

95
00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:44.038
backgrounds, shape shifting, using energies

96
00:04:44.038 --> 00:04:49.038
as they would, moving objects, moving other energies,

97
00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:54.307
moving their minds, being by locating some do this.

98
00:04:56.112 --> 00:04:58.672
So it is an adventure now for humans to explore

99
00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:01.711
and to experience that masterfulness

100
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:04.847
that is their birthright but never before have

101
00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:07.556
they been ready to accept that responsibility

102
00:05:07.556 --> 00:05:12.015
or ready physically to accept this energetic,

103
00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:16.836
the fifth dimensionsionary energies fully in place now

104
00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:21.198
and that is some of what you have been experiencing

105
00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:24.291
in your own physical bodies and the earth

106
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.587
is experiencing it as well.

107
00:05:27.587 --> 00:05:32.024
It is aligned astrologically so there are many

108
00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:37.024
influences to this energetic field.

109
00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:40.706
<v Regina>And when you say aligned astrologically,</v>

110
00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:43.629
are you speaking about the positioning of the planet

111
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.837
earth itself as moving toward what many call

112
00:05:45.837 --> 00:05:50.060
the galactic center of our galaxy the Milky Way,

113
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.780
this grand cross of alignment?

114
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.242
<v ->It is.</v>

115
00:05:54.242 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

116
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.860
<v ->And it is also being effected and it's been proven so</v>

117
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.860
by the sciences that the sun of your solar system

118
00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:08.760
is very influential in its' activity to the activities

119
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.676
of the entire solar system.

120
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Regina>Yes, and I wanted to talk to you about that</v>

121
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.324
as we'll start a little farther out and work our way in.

122
00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:22.324
Then the sun itself is having as I understand it,

123
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.345
a great amount of pressure exerted on it

124
00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:27.852
with this cosmic event that is occurring at this time.

125
00:06:27.852 --> 00:06:30.988
Does that tend to be the case and how

126
00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:33.302
is it effecting, how is it impacting the function

127
00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:36.491
and consciousness of the sun?

128
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:37.995
<v ->It is effecting.</v>

129
00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:41.707
It is natural to the sun to have these events

130
00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:46.123
as it were, for it is a very fluid planet

131
00:06:46.123 --> 00:06:50.048
and it is an energy ball so to speak.

132
00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:51.072
Do you understand?

133
00:06:51.072 --> 00:06:51.669
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

134
00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.359
<v ->So it is in fluxation of certain frequencies</v>

135
00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:58.772
and energies and then it becomes hotter

136
00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:03.465
or cooler, it has its' own experiences energetically.

137
00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:08.465
How it affects the other planets of the solar system

138
00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:14.364
has a great influence on its' activity electrically

139
00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:20.102
and seismically meaning as you've witnessed

140
00:07:20.552 --> 00:07:25.552
upon your planet much seismic or pressure expressions

141
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:30.333
it may at one time cataclysmic.

142
00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:35.333
It is only to those who are upon that crevice

143
00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:40.581
or upon the volcanic mountain, but it is not for all.

144
00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:45.234
Which you're bearing witness to this activity

145
00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:50.234
that does become a part of the energetic field

146
00:07:50.673 --> 00:07:53.436
that is felt throughout your world

147
00:07:53.436 --> 00:07:57.915
and your galaxy as well but most are concerned

148
00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:00.486
about their own well being, are they not?

149
00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:03.088
<v Regina>Yes, yes indeed.</v>

150
00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:05.926
Because we have fear and survival issues

151
00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.824
that play into from the frequencies

152
00:08:07.824 --> 00:08:09.616
we're moving out of.

153
00:08:09.616 --> 00:08:12.730
Looking at what you just said about the effect

154
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.543
of these seismic areas for example,

155
00:08:15.543 --> 00:08:19.674
what about the more subtle influences that we feel

156
00:08:19.674 --> 00:08:22.970
on the planet such as the geomagnetic lines

157
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.644
for example.

158
00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:28.825
Such as the positive and negative vertices of

159
00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:32.420
the planet, are these being pressured or stressed

160
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.257
or more enlivened at this point in time,

161
00:08:35.257 --> 00:08:36.420
even though we may not see them

162
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.828
and they may not make the headlines

163
00:08:37.828 --> 00:08:40.291
in the form of seismic activity?

164
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:43.470
<v ->They are enlightened as you put it.</v>

165
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.752
That is a good way of speaking.

166
00:08:45.752 --> 00:08:50.752
For the frequencies are heightened

167
00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:55.149
and so what beings may find if they are in

168
00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:59.330
a particular area of a vertice then they are

169
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.394
effected energetically, they may become dizzy,

170
00:09:03.394 --> 00:09:08.394
they may become ill in their equilibrium

171
00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:12.151
meaning they may have a dizziness,

172
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.127
they may have an upset stomach, they may be

173
00:09:15.127 --> 00:09:18.028
experiencing things thinking they are having

174
00:09:18.028 --> 00:09:23.028
a symptom of a virus, which is not the case.

175
00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:26.945
They're only experiencing, and as we said,

176
00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:31.467
it does effect the equilibrium of many.

177
00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:33.813
<v Regina>Yes and so a person may have been living</v>

178
00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:35.648
in the same place for quite a long time,

179
00:09:35.648 --> 00:09:37.525
but are you saying then that because

180
00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:40.501
of the moving upward of the frequency,

181
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:43.104
the enlivening of these frequencies at a place

182
00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:45.493
that may have been very stable to their field

183
00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:48.181
is now unstable and uncomfortable?

184
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.791
<v ->Yes.</v>

185
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:50.858
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

186
00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:53.706
<v ->But this too will not be long lived for the beings</v>

187
00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:56.500
will adjust.

188
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.028
It takes a bit of time for adjustment but it is

189
00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:03.465
a part of this metamorphosis if you would

190
00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:06.878
that is occurring upon this planet

191
00:10:06.878 --> 00:10:10.590
through higher dimensional frequency.

192
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.168
<v Regina>So what happens then when a person</v>

193
00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:17.168
is coming across say a very specifically located

194
00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:20.850
little, I'm not talking about the big famous ones

195
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.549
in the coffee table picture books, but the little

196
00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:26.375
vertices that are both have either positive

197
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:31.375
or negative influences, how does a person recognize

198
00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:37.127
if they're simply passing through one of these places

199
00:10:37.127 --> 00:10:42.127
verses having something truly, organically disturbed

200
00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:44.092
in their body?

201
00:10:44.092 --> 00:10:44.977
How will they tell the difference?

202
00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.046
<v ->If they are passing through it'll be short lived,</v>

203
00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.851
if they're living on it, it may not be as short lived

204
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:54.851
as would be their experience of passing over

205
00:10:54.939 --> 00:10:58.864
or through.

206
00:10:58.864 --> 00:11:01.861
But most who have been living in these areas

207
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:06.861
of energetic fields are familiar with their shifts

208
00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:08.709
and have learned from it, if they have been there

209
00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.074
for some time.

210
00:11:10.074 --> 00:11:14.394
It is the passerby, should we say,

211
00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:19.394
that would may, be alarmed.

212
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:21.412
<v Regina>And what would some of the symptoms be</v>

213
00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:24.153
that they would feel in a situation like that,

214
00:11:24.153 --> 00:11:26.052
passing through one of these negative vortexes?

215
00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:27.673
And they exist all over.

216
00:11:27.673 --> 00:11:32.673
<v ->Yes, it could be a shift of their emotional energy,</v>

217
00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:36.494
feeling very depressed or down,

218
00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:41.494
or they may feel dizzy and disoriented,

219
00:11:43.597 --> 00:11:47.128
but it's not long lived.

220
00:11:47.128 --> 00:11:49.080
For they pass through and then their body

221
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.490
will adjust again.

222
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:56.490
They may feel a time space skip.

223
00:11:58.594 --> 00:12:00.994
<v Regina>What about, let's reverse that,</v>

224
00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:02.540
what about when they're passing through

225
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:07.540
the positive vertices on the planet?

226
00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:11.062
<v ->Some of their symptoms could be the same</v>

227
00:12:11.062 --> 00:12:15.499
because it can be disorienting, but as a sense also

228
00:12:15.499 --> 00:12:20.499
of ad joinment, there's a sensitiveness

229
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.256
in alignment to them in this positive way.

230
00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:28.475
A sense of joy, peace, and a sense of love.

231
00:12:33.075 --> 00:12:35.583
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

232
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:37.909
<v ->And most often gratitude, for when they have,</v>

233
00:12:37.909 --> 00:12:40.330
there is this sense of well being and a feeling

234
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.340
of bouyance by a love feeling,

235
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.906
then there is a sense of gratitude for life.

236
00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:51.689
<v Regina>And so at this point in time,</v>

237
00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:55.614
do you perceive that many people are essentially

238
00:12:55.614 --> 00:12:58.515
feeling this restlessness and this desire to

239
00:12:58.515 --> 00:13:00.702
move around because they're seeking to get away

240
00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:02.931
from the uncomfortableness of the enlivened

241
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:05.203
geomagnetic lines and maybe they're seeking

242
00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:07.507
some of these positive areas or vertices

243
00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:09.459
as we perceive them?

244
00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:12.402
<v ->They are, they are completing in a certain area</v>

245
00:13:12.402 --> 00:13:16.488
of their life, maybe with relationship or place.

246
00:13:16.488 --> 00:13:21.488
It is a catalyst for growth so it can give the impulse

247
00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:25.874
to move, to change.

248
00:13:25.874 --> 00:13:30.535
And it can bring forth opportunities to make those changes

249
00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:33.393
that fall into place even though they may

250
00:13:33.393 --> 00:13:37.020
be uncomfortable or one does not desire change

251
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.454
or is uncomfortable with change so it is more

252
00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:42.982
difficult for them then it would be someone

253
00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:46.512
who is ready an anxious and loves change

254
00:13:46.512 --> 00:13:49.200
and new experiences.

255
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.200
It is dependent upon the personality traits.

256
00:13:54.843 --> 00:13:58.757
On how they meet this energy.

257
00:13:58.757 --> 00:14:00.357
<v Regina>Yes, and of course the human species</v>

258
00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:02.191
does seem to have a certain resistance

259
00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:05.167
to change at large, although more are opening

260
00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:07.716
up and embracing it with the time.

261
00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:12.388
<v ->The less resistance one has the easier</v>

262
00:14:12.388 --> 00:14:17.028
it would be, not only mentally, but physically.

263
00:14:17.028 --> 00:14:18.980
<v Regina>Yes, that's a very good point.</v>

264
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.627
I want to get into some of the physical

265
00:14:22.627 --> 00:14:24.270
elements of this change going on,

266
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.435
but since we're on the subject of the earth

267
00:14:26.435 --> 00:14:28.963
and vertices and the earth energies themselves,

268
00:14:28.963 --> 00:14:32.632
I'd like to talk about perhaps a lesser known

269
00:14:32.632 --> 00:14:35.160
or little more extreme phenomena on the planet

270
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.690
which are more the inter dimensional portals

271
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.266
or some call them, even in military parliaments,

272
00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:44.567
star gates.

273
00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:46.701
Can you talk a little bit to the subject of

274
00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:50.786
the inter dimensional portals on the planet?

275
00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:54.529
<v ->There are those in which beings can participate</v>

276
00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:57.377
if you would and many have, some call them

277
00:14:57.377 --> 00:15:01.772
wormholes, star gates, opportunities of experiencing

278
00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:06.772
universal dimensions and this does occur

279
00:15:07.947 --> 00:15:11.478
to those who are accepting of it.

280
00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:12.288
Do you understand?

281
00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:13.078
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

282
00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:16.469
<v ->For when one has the belief, they are more open</v>

283
00:15:16.469 --> 00:15:21.469
to those opportunities, experientially speaking.

284
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.293
<v Regina>Much of that, those places on the planet,</v>

285
00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:28.863
as I alluded to earlier, have been co opted

286
00:15:28.863 --> 00:15:31.306
by military purposes and are clouded

287
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.930
from public view and much of the public

288
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.532
doesn't have access to the ones that are considered

289
00:15:36.532 --> 00:15:39.572
to be the primary physical star gates

290
00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:41.726
on this planet.

291
00:15:41.726 --> 00:15:46.579
In the future, do you see these places

292
00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.787
becoming available to the public at large

293
00:15:48.787 --> 00:15:52.990
and if so, how do you see us really utilizing them

294
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.539
in a positive way in the future?

295
00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:59.069
<v ->In time, yes, but it would be a great deal of time</v>

296
00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:04.069
before there is that opportunity.

297
00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:09.287
For some who are ready to experience and have

298
00:16:09.287 --> 00:16:14.287
the opportunity to participate energetically there,

299
00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:16.306
but many are not ready yet.

300
00:16:16.306 --> 00:16:18.460
That's what this energy, this fifth dimension

301
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.063
is about, is a readiness, an acceptance

302
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.900
of vibrational frequency knowing that you're more

303
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.588
than your physical body.

304
00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:31.588
And that there are these places

305
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:37.136
that one can express and experience,

306
00:16:37.136 --> 00:16:39.195
the multi-dimensionality.

307
00:16:39.195 --> 00:16:43.173
But not all are ready yet, so if the gate were open there

308
00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:47.600
to do such, it could produce fear.

309
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.554
And that has been a concern.

310
00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:52.410
<v Regina>What does that look like?</v>

311
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.703
Let's put ourselves a bit in the future

312
00:16:54.703 --> 00:16:56.591
so that we have moved out of the fear

313
00:16:56.591 --> 00:16:59.535
and we have gained acceptance of our potentials,

314
00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:04.535
what would a proper positive, uplifting use

315
00:17:05.337 --> 00:17:08.985
of these star gates or fields, these inter dimensional

316
00:17:08.985 --> 00:17:12.729
portals be like for us in the future?

317
00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:16.206
<v ->It would be the ability to be in more than one place</v>

318
00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:18.488
at one time, as many masters that have

319
00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:19.896
been written about.

320
00:17:19.896 --> 00:17:23.107
There would be an awareness of all that is.

321
00:17:23.107 --> 00:17:25.421
There would be an at onement in that sense

322
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:29.442
of connectivity to source in the physical body

323
00:17:29.442 --> 00:17:32.738
and a continual basis.

324
00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:36.034
Now we are speaking in mass, do you understand?

325
00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:36.706
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

326
00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:40.172
<v ->There are those who already have that capability</v>

327
00:17:40.172 --> 00:17:43.649
and that sense of knowing us but we are speaking

328
00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:47.233
in mass now that beings have raised their frequencies,

329
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.857
they are ready, they are accepting, and they have

330
00:17:49.857 --> 00:17:52.545
a belief that they have this power.

331
00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:57.142
So they can utilize the energies that are there

332
00:17:57.142 --> 00:18:01.622
in a significant way to skip time space,

333
00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:06.622
go into other dimensions, go into other states of being.

334
00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:09.056
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm, when you say states of being,</v>

335
00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:11.424
do you care to expand on that?

336
00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.629
<v ->Out of body.</v>

337
00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:17.629
Also there can be that which is a total awareness

338
00:18:19.135 --> 00:18:20.970
of all that is.

339
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.212
Not necessarily out of the body, in the body.

340
00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:29.212
A totality, that sense of pureness of love.

341
00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.150
See it is a glorious experience when one

342
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.990
is ready and available to it.

343
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.933
Heaven on earth one might say.

344
00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:48.933
<v Regina>And when beings, people,</v>

345
00:18:50.024 --> 00:18:52.648
are ready for this and for those who already are

346
00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:56.733
experiencing this, when they move into these

347
00:18:56.733 --> 00:19:00.146
other dimensions, are these then would you define as

348
00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:02.589
the other higher dimensional frequencies

349
00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:04.679
of the earth itself?

350
00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:05.980
<v ->Yes.</v>

351
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.631
<v Regina>Because I think often people believe</v>

352
00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:11.953
because we have a hard time understanding

353
00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:15.665
our own multi dimensionality, that we also

354
00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:17.660
don't understand the multi dimensionality

355
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.891
of our beautiful hostess that we live within

356
00:19:20.891 --> 00:19:24.369
and on which is the earth itself, has her own journey

357
00:19:24.369 --> 00:19:27.878
and many dimensional frequencies.

358
00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:29.808
Can you talk about this and about where some

359
00:19:29.808 --> 00:19:33.200
of the beings that live here have actually come from

360
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.445
prior to this frequency or density?

361
00:19:37.445 --> 00:19:40.741
<v ->There are 12 dimensions about the earth</v>

362
00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:42.810
and we've spoken of five.

363
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.711
The sixth will be experienced physically

364
00:19:45.711 --> 00:19:47.962
and that is full masterhood.

365
00:19:47.962 --> 00:19:52.260
The others are theoric or energy frequencies

366
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.993
in that sense that you go out of body to experience

367
00:19:55.993 --> 00:19:59.620
and you experience those teachers and angelic beings

368
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.385
that are there and present, however, that is only

369
00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:07.001
one choice when you're choosing their earthly experience

370
00:20:07.001 --> 00:20:11.182
in those dimensions of it, but no, there are billions

371
00:20:11.182 --> 00:20:16.182
and billions of choices that us all could make.

372
00:20:16.643 --> 00:20:20.642
To experience and you are speaking of your galaxy

373
00:20:20.642 --> 00:20:24.461
and there, as you look to the sky,

374
00:20:24.461 --> 00:20:28.588
and you see those stars of which you are enamored

375
00:20:28.588 --> 00:20:32.332
and there are certain configurations of stars

376
00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:36.951
that are other galaxies, and the souls can experience

377
00:20:36.951 --> 00:20:41.174
those as well, but it's difficult for beings

378
00:20:41.174 --> 00:20:44.385
to conceptualize what that could be.

379
00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:46.753
For you are limited by your earthly experience

380
00:20:46.753 --> 00:20:49.377
and your conscious mind and the conscious mind

381
00:20:49.377 --> 00:20:54.377
perceives in pictures of what is known.

382
00:20:55.104 --> 00:21:00.104
And words do a disservice because they limit as well.

383
00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:05.258
So that is why we oft say that one must experience

384
00:21:05.258 --> 00:21:10.258
for there's no greater learning than experience itself.

385
00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:10.794
Yes?

386
00:21:10.794 --> 00:21:15.412
<v Regina>Yes and I'm sorry, do you have more on that?</v>

387
00:21:15.412 --> 00:21:17.961
<v ->You may ask.</v>

388
00:21:17.961 --> 00:21:19.519
<v Regina>This really seems to come down</v>

389
00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:22.836
repeatedly, it doesn't matter what our earth experience

390
00:21:22.836 --> 00:21:26.164
is, it seems to come repeatedly down to the very

391
00:21:26.164 --> 00:21:29.246
limited aspect of our conscious mind,

392
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:31.177
the availability of pictures.

393
00:21:31.177 --> 00:21:36.177
How do we then begin expanding our possibilities

394
00:21:36.286 --> 00:21:40.392
when we don't have the existing pictures already?

395
00:21:40.392 --> 00:21:44.221
<v ->When you have experience, then you have a new way</v>

396
00:21:44.221 --> 00:21:49.221
of expression and knowing that is beyond description

397
00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:55.879
because of the limited vocabularies

398
00:21:55.879 --> 00:21:58.716
because the vocabularies come with a picture

399
00:21:58.716 --> 00:22:02.012
most often.

400
00:22:02.012 --> 00:22:06.310
But when it is a knowingness of the experience

401
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:11.310
of the experiencer, it needs not be spoken of,

402
00:22:11.995 --> 00:22:14.801
for it is.

403
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:15.504
You understand?

404
00:22:15.504 --> 00:22:18.032
<v Regina>I do and having been through</v>

405
00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:22.096
some interesting experiences myself,

406
00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:24.507
it's almost beyond the ability to articulate because

407
00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:26.480
it's mostly kinesthetic.

408
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.829
It's kinesthetic and it's a sense of knowing

409
00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:32.826
and so it seems that knowledge as with gurus

410
00:22:32.826 --> 00:22:35.514
for example, you'll know one day.

411
00:22:35.514 --> 00:22:37.604
They'll say, just keep on your path

412
00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:39.908
and you'll know one day and I do understand why

413
00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:42.713
that's said, so pictures and words can't really

414
00:22:42.713 --> 00:22:45.497
adequately be relayed can they?

415
00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.470
<v ->They cannot.</v>

416
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:52.121
<v Regina>So we have to choose to expand our awareness</v>

417
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:55.971
into the new experience without fear.

418
00:22:55.971 --> 00:22:58.574
<v ->That is correct.</v>

419
00:22:58.574 --> 00:23:03.448
But as you know, beings fear loss of control

420
00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:06.957
and it takes a bit of an ability to relinquish control,

421
00:23:06.957 --> 00:23:07.811
does it not?

422
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:08.930
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

423
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.645
<v ->And know that you're not going to lose your body</v>

424
00:23:13.645 --> 00:23:18.071
or your mind and that's what beings fear.

425
00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:23.071
It is so out of any context that it's being comfortably

426
00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:28.087
known that they may lose their faculties

427
00:23:28.087 --> 00:23:33.087
or their body and know that their free will is all power.

428
00:23:35.393 --> 00:23:37.782
If beings are out of their bodies, all they have to do

429
00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:42.080
is think about their body and they'll be in it again.

430
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.888
No one can usurp your free will.

431
00:23:45.888 --> 00:23:49.888
No one can take your power from you.

432
00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:52.373
It is only given away.

433
00:23:52.373 --> 00:23:54.901
<v Regina>This is a very good thing to talk about</v>

434
00:23:54.901 --> 00:23:57.823
right now because what as you well know

435
00:23:57.823 --> 00:24:01.908
beyond probably what we even understand I'm sure,

436
00:24:01.908 --> 00:24:05.631
the mass consciousness of the peoples on this planet

437
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.225
has been manipulated shall we say,

438
00:24:09.225 --> 00:24:11.913
into a state of perpetual fear, much of it through

439
00:24:11.913 --> 00:24:14.654
the media and so forth.

440
00:24:14.654 --> 00:24:19.654
And think one of the places many people become stuck

441
00:24:20.606 --> 00:24:24.894
is in having an awareness of some of the manipulations

442
00:24:24.894 --> 00:24:29.309
going on but not succumbing to the manipulations.

443
00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:31.144
From your perspective can you speak about

444
00:24:31.144 --> 00:24:35.784
what that looks like?

445
00:24:35.784 --> 00:24:39.431
<v ->It is consciousness, it is an awareness</v>

446
00:24:39.431 --> 00:24:42.173
and truth will out all that has been hidden

447
00:24:42.173 --> 00:24:45.234
and deceived is bubbling to the surface now.

448
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:49.234
To be shown, to be recognized.

449
00:24:49.234 --> 00:24:52.113
So those who think they are controlling

450
00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:57.113
with this subterfuge and these processes

451
00:24:58.428 --> 00:25:03.428
will be shown as the perpetrators of control

452
00:25:03.931 --> 00:25:06.246
and manipulation.

453
00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:07.899
It has already begun.

454
00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:10.480
You are experiencing that economically.

455
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.605
You're experiencing that with each moment

456
00:25:13.605 --> 00:25:18.149
and each day there's something that comes forth

457
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:23.149
that is brought to the awareness of the masses

458
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.951
and it's not to fear this, it is good.

459
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:32.132
It is important that the truth will out.

460
00:25:32.132 --> 00:25:34.223
The truth be told.

461
00:25:34.223 --> 00:25:38.787
Not in the fear, not to fear, but to see when knowledge

462
00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:42.286
is there, understanding comes, and the ability

463
00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:47.286
to change it will be.

464
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.272
<v Regina>And yet the people pass through a period</v>

465
00:25:53.272 --> 00:25:57.379
that has been a very popular past time on the planet

466
00:25:57.379 --> 00:26:01.816
is relegated to what is called conspiracy theory

467
00:26:01.816 --> 00:26:06.594
which that's interesting terminology in and of itself.

468
00:26:06.594 --> 00:26:09.687
But nonetheless, basically bringing forth that

469
00:26:09.687 --> 00:26:11.682
which has been hidden from us in secret

470
00:26:11.682 --> 00:26:14.028
and one of the first reactions that people have

471
00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:16.556
and I've interviewed many of these people,

472
00:26:16.556 --> 00:26:19.020
one of the first reactions human's have more than fear

473
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.731
is anger.

474
00:26:20.731 --> 00:26:24.065
Anger at the knowledge that they have been fooled

475
00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:26.966
or tricked or coned on some level.

476
00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:30.838
Is this even perhaps an appropriate place to pass through

477
00:26:30.838 --> 00:26:33.483
to start one on the path to understanding

478
00:26:33.483 --> 00:26:35.040
the greater picture?

479
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.125
<v ->But is it not fear and anger that is placed outside</v>

480
00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:41.525
themselves, at someone else?

481
00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:42.453
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

482
00:26:42.453 --> 00:26:44.864
<v ->Rather than taking the responsibility that</v>

483
00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:49.461
they relinquished for the known.

484
00:26:49.461 --> 00:26:52.714
For so often beings are manipulated in such a way

485
00:26:52.714 --> 00:26:55.380
because they don't want to take responsibility.

486
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.471
They don't want to know.

487
00:26:57.471 --> 00:26:58.239
<v Regina>This is true.</v>

488
00:26:58.239 --> 00:27:02.623
<v ->They want others to do their work for them</v>

489
00:27:02.623 --> 00:27:05.161
and this is the time of awakening,

490
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:08.937
that each being is responsible for their own life

491
00:27:08.937 --> 00:27:10.313
and their own experiences.

492
00:27:10.313 --> 00:27:14.888
There are no victims upon this planet.

493
00:27:14.888 --> 00:27:18.227
And that seems harsh to say but there's not.

494
00:27:18.227 --> 00:27:21.853
You are all volunteers in this embodiment.

495
00:27:21.853 --> 00:27:26.853
You have chosen to be here so in knowing that you've

496
00:27:27.028 --> 00:27:32.020
chosen this unique and beautiful body,

497
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:37.020
this unique and beautiful earthly experience,

498
00:27:37.728 --> 00:27:42.728
do not ignore it and pass it off onto another

499
00:27:44.541 --> 00:27:46.984
to do for you.

500
00:27:46.984 --> 00:27:50.002
Be aware.

501
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:55.002
It is only those who become unconscious

502
00:27:55.197 --> 00:28:00.197
that turn their power over to others,

503
00:28:00.658 --> 00:28:03.559
that allow for this manipulation.

504
00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:04.508
Do you understand?

505
00:28:04.508 --> 00:28:06.065
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

506
00:28:06.065 --> 00:28:07.324
<v ->And it's easier said than done</v>

507
00:28:07.324 --> 00:28:12.028
because it's been going on for thousands of years.

508
00:28:12.028 --> 00:28:13.937
<v Regina>I would like to ask you about that,</v>

509
00:28:13.937 --> 00:28:15.729
when you talk about the thousands of years

510
00:28:15.729 --> 00:28:20.411
of manipulation.

511
00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:23.248
Are we speaking about manipulation just from within,

512
00:28:23.248 --> 00:28:25.478
are you speaking about it from just within

513
00:28:25.478 --> 00:28:28.220
the human species or perhaps other species

514
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.241
that interface knowingly or unknowingly to us

515
00:28:31.241 --> 00:28:36.115
with the human species or all of the above?

516
00:28:36.115 --> 00:28:37.747
<v ->It's still the same, is it not?</v>

517
00:28:37.747 --> 00:28:40.232
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

518
00:28:40.232 --> 00:28:43.592
<v ->One cannot take your power from you.</v>

519
00:28:43.592 --> 00:28:46.099
You give it.

520
00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:48.680
And we're not speaking of aggression.

521
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.304
Do you understand?

522
00:28:51.304 --> 00:28:52.551
<v Regina>Yes I believe so.</v>

523
00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:53.671
<v ->It's apathy.</v>

524
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:55.069
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

525
00:28:55.069 --> 00:28:59.986
<v ->It's non attention.</v>

526
00:28:59.986 --> 00:29:01.522
<v Regina>It's easy to be manipulated when</v>

527
00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:04.604
we are essentially sleeping through our own lives.

528
00:29:04.604 --> 00:29:08.721
<v ->Correct and abdicating your personal power</v>

529
00:29:08.721 --> 00:29:10.481
to others.

530
00:29:10.481 --> 00:29:11.622
<v Regina>And this is across the board</v>

531
00:29:11.622 --> 00:29:13.595
for our health, for our education,

532
00:29:13.595 --> 00:29:17.883
for our well being on every level.

533
00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:21.275
Entertainment, we have abdicated our responsibility

534
00:29:21.275 --> 00:29:24.411
in virtually every area of our life.

535
00:29:24.411 --> 00:29:27.387
<v ->And you may speak in groups together that this is wrong</v>

536
00:29:27.387 --> 00:29:31.536
and you should be doing something and it stops there.

537
00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:33.402
Yes?

538
00:29:33.402 --> 00:29:34.061
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

539
00:29:34.061 --> 00:29:35.799
<v ->It's usually a discussion about they.</v>

540
00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:37.495
They are doing this, they are doing that,

541
00:29:37.495 --> 00:29:39.842
they are you.

542
00:29:39.842 --> 00:29:42.348
<v Regina>They are we, yes.</v>

543
00:29:42.348 --> 00:29:46.924
There is no con without those willing to be coned.

544
00:29:46.924 --> 00:29:49.324
<v ->Correct.</v>

545
00:29:49.324 --> 00:29:52.012
<v Regina>Yes, I just wanted to clear that</v>

546
00:29:52.012 --> 00:29:53.846
because I know some our viewers will be wondering

547
00:29:53.846 --> 00:29:57.792
about external control that is exerting itself

548
00:29:57.792 --> 00:30:00.225
and again it still comes back to our complicity

549
00:30:00.225 --> 00:30:01.547
in the game, right?

550
00:30:01.547 --> 00:30:03.414
<v ->Correct.</v>

551
00:30:03.414 --> 00:30:05.942
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

552
00:30:05.942 --> 00:30:09.376
I would like to talk a little bit about

553
00:30:09.376 --> 00:30:11.115
the physical body.

554
00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:13.515
Through this transition we're going on,

555
00:30:13.515 --> 00:30:16.000
going through right now, there are certain traits

556
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
that seem to be very common such as fatigue.

557
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:24.938
A lot of beings, it's as though our batteries

558
00:30:24.938 --> 00:30:28.212
are feeling as though we're drained at this time

559
00:30:28.212 --> 00:30:31.039
and as electrical beings, can you speak to this

560
00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:33.481
even if it's a bit of a more mechanical level?

561
00:30:33.481 --> 00:30:36.169
But speak to this because it's very hard

562
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:38.494
to go through transition without energy,

563
00:30:38.494 --> 00:30:40.606
without energy we don't have, when we don't

564
00:30:40.606 --> 00:30:43.603
feel on top of our game and our awareness.

565
00:30:43.603 --> 00:30:44.905
<v ->That is true.</v>

566
00:30:44.905 --> 00:30:49.427
You are being depleted on your adrenal level.

567
00:30:49.427 --> 00:30:53.981
When there is this electromagnetic shift,

568
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:56.328
think in terms of putting your finger in

569
00:30:56.328 --> 00:30:59.826
an electrical socket.

570
00:30:59.826 --> 00:31:01.799
No one would do that.

571
00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:02.919
Correct?

572
00:31:02.919 --> 00:31:03.890
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

573
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.863
<v ->Knowingly so unless it was an infant</v>

574
00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:08.658
or a child that knows not better,

575
00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:12.549
but if you likened it to that, an extreme shock

576
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:16.348
that the body would go through of readjustment,

577
00:31:16.348 --> 00:31:18.620
that is what is occurring.

578
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.801
So ones must take care nutritionally,

579
00:31:22.801 --> 00:31:27.801
resting, mediating, paying attention to your,

580
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.016
the nutrition and supplementation

581
00:31:32.016 --> 00:31:34.597
because your nutrition will not be enough.

582
00:31:34.597 --> 00:31:39.077
Just the food stuff that you eat, you must supplement

583
00:31:39.077 --> 00:31:44.077
your vitamins and minerals to maintain this balance

584
00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:46.874
and there are homeopathics that can

585
00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:51.866
be taken that do assist the adrenal system,

586
00:31:51.866 --> 00:31:53.327
the nervous system.

587
00:31:53.327 --> 00:31:56.399
What you'll take note of that there will be

588
00:31:56.399 --> 00:32:00.366
more aggravation for some with digestion.

589
00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:05.366
There will be for many dysfunctionality

590
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:11.190
of thyroid in certain organs and hormonal balances.

591
00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:15.576
So pay attention to these, minerals become depleted

592
00:32:15.576 --> 00:32:18.456
very readily in this spirit of time

593
00:32:18.456 --> 00:32:20.291
because they are the conduits.

594
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:22.029
<v Regina>This is what I was going to ask you next.</v>

595
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:23.629
Can you please elaborate on this?

596
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:26.626
Magnesium and any of the really primary players

597
00:32:26.626 --> 00:32:27.554
right now?

598
00:32:27.554 --> 00:32:32.554
<v ->Potassium, magnesium, zinc, manganese,</v>

599
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.953
these are four that are very prevalent

600
00:32:37.953 --> 00:32:42.369
and for those who are having a great deal

601
00:32:42.369 --> 00:32:44.780
of pain in their world, it is a depletion

602
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.780
of their magnesium, potassium, manganese,

603
00:32:51.521 --> 00:32:53.558
and know that these are rocks that you're digesting

604
00:32:53.558 --> 00:32:57.302
so if you can have them in liquid form

605
00:32:57.302 --> 00:33:02.219
it's better absorbed, or to take your supplementation,

606
00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:06.442
vitamins and minerals with food.

607
00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Regina>And can you explain what happens</v>

608
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.090
when we take them with the food?

609
00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:14.879
<v ->They digest with the food and then they're absorbed</v>

610
00:33:14.879 --> 00:33:16.522
better.

611
00:33:16.522 --> 00:33:19.519
It works together you see.

612
00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:21.097
<v Regina>So if we liken this again</v>

613
00:33:21.097 --> 00:33:22.836
to a battery, we are talking about,

614
00:33:22.836 --> 00:33:26.046
we're talking about metals, we're talking about minerals

615
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:28.617
and these are being very depleted in the process

616
00:33:28.617 --> 00:33:31.731
of our having stuck our fingers into that socket

617
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:32.542
as it were.

618
00:33:32.542 --> 00:33:33.427
<v ->They're burned up.</v>

619
00:33:33.427 --> 00:33:34.313
<v Regina>They're burning up.</v>

620
00:33:34.313 --> 00:33:39.313
<v ->Yes, they're burned up and they're being</v>

621
00:33:39.486 --> 00:33:42.067
washed out of the body.

622
00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:45.661
Many are drinking water and rightly so

623
00:33:45.661 --> 00:33:48.541
because it is necessary, but know your minerals

624
00:33:48.541 --> 00:33:50.557
are being depleted in this way as well.

625
00:33:50.557 --> 00:33:52.541
That is why it's extremely important

626
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:55.047
to pay attention to what your body is doing

627
00:33:55.047 --> 00:33:57.778
and what it tells you it needs.

628
00:33:57.778 --> 00:34:00.380
For the body will speak clearly to you.

629
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.311
It does not mean that there's something wrong

630
00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:04.561
with you.

631
00:34:04.561 --> 00:34:06.492
What it means is that you just pay attention

632
00:34:06.492 --> 00:34:11.228
and just as if you had a beautiful automobile

633
00:34:11.228 --> 00:34:14.289
and you took such exquisite care of it.

634
00:34:14.289 --> 00:34:18.289
You changed its' oil, you put air in its' tires,

635
00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:20.912
you made sure the polish was just right

636
00:34:20.912 --> 00:34:23.739
so the elements did not harm it,

637
00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.853
and you vacuumed out the interior

638
00:34:26.853 --> 00:34:29.872
and you polished everything and you went

639
00:34:29.872 --> 00:34:33.050
ah ha, and it runs perfectly, and it matters

640
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.506
not the age if it's well cared for.

641
00:34:36.506 --> 00:34:37.999
<v Regina>Same as the human vehicle.</v>

642
00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:39.365
<v ->It is the human vehicle.</v>

643
00:34:39.365 --> 00:34:40.271
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

644
00:34:40.271 --> 00:34:43.034
<v ->And many do not care for the human vehicle</v>

645
00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:45.519
as they would an automobile.

646
00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:46.447
<v Regina>Very true.</v>

647
00:34:46.447 --> 00:34:47.471
<v ->Or a home.</v>

648
00:34:47.471 --> 00:34:49.092
<v Regina>Very true.</v>

649
00:34:49.092 --> 00:34:49.839
<v ->Do you see?</v>

650
00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:51.460
<v Regina>We expect that it will just</v>

651
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.441
go on auto pilot.

652
00:34:52.441 --> 00:34:54.809
That it's all taken care of and then we fall into

653
00:34:54.809 --> 00:34:57.390
disrepair and end up in the shop and the shop

654
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.238
is not a good place to end up these days.

655
00:35:00.238 --> 00:35:01.166
<v ->Yes.</v>

656
00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:03.133
<v Regina>In the real body shops,</v>

657
00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:06.264
the hospital and medical care and pharmaceutical systems.

658
00:35:06.264 --> 00:35:08.589
So another thing that is happening besides

659
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:10.829
this depletion in our energies, in our batteries

660
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:12.962
is that we're having short circuits in our electrical

661
00:35:12.962 --> 00:35:14.029
systems.

662
00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:17.026
There seems to be a very great increase,

663
00:35:17.026 --> 00:35:20.130
for example, in seizures of all kinds.

664
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.407
Also heart conditions, people even who are very young,

665
00:35:24.407 --> 00:35:29.217
experiencing heart conditions and sudden electrical

666
00:35:29.217 --> 00:35:31.116
shift that can lead to death.

667
00:35:31.116 --> 00:35:33.484
Can you talk a little bit to that,

668
00:35:33.484 --> 00:35:36.620
these electrical issues going on in our bodies?

669
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.915
<v ->You've spoken very well about it.</v>

670
00:35:39.915 --> 00:35:42.795
It is an adjustment frequency yes.

671
00:35:42.795 --> 00:35:45.654
Certain facets of the brain work certain parts

672
00:35:45.654 --> 00:35:47.435
of the body of course.

673
00:35:47.435 --> 00:35:48.971
We all know this, yes?

674
00:35:48.971 --> 00:35:53.971
The heart is a very important factor here

675
00:35:54.379 --> 00:35:57.173
because if you did not have the pumping of blood

676
00:35:57.173 --> 00:35:59.349
through all of the veins of the body,

677
00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:04.349
feeding oxygen and nutrients to the cells,

678
00:36:06.666 --> 00:36:07.988
there would be death, yes?

679
00:36:07.988 --> 00:36:10.335
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

680
00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:13.353
<v ->So what is effected electrically?</v>

681
00:36:13.353 --> 00:36:16.809
The brain and the heart.

682
00:36:16.809 --> 00:36:17.598
Do you see?

683
00:36:17.598 --> 00:36:18.484
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

684
00:36:18.484 --> 00:36:22.355
<v ->So that's another reason you use your minerals.</v>

685
00:36:22.355 --> 00:36:24.382
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

686
00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:29.382
<v ->The minerals magnesium and potassium</v>

687
00:36:29.672 --> 00:36:34.672
are what help the heart beat and pump the blood.

688
00:36:36.157 --> 00:36:41.157
The other minerals assist in the brain functionality

689
00:36:46.087 --> 00:36:47.975
and the other nutrients as well.

690
00:36:47.975 --> 00:36:51.868
The hormonal balance is necessary for the functionality

691
00:36:51.868 --> 00:36:54.449
of the brain and the well balance of it.

692
00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:56.743
The thyroid is extremely important

693
00:36:56.743 --> 00:36:59.185
and that is why you must pay attention to it

694
00:36:59.185 --> 00:37:02.641
because it is that temperature gauge.

695
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:05.830
The monitor for the body.

696
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.830
It monitors many things and it assists

697
00:37:11.323 --> 00:37:13.275
the hormonal balance.

698
00:37:13.275 --> 00:37:14.832
<v Regina>Yet we have an epidemic</v>

699
00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:17.712
at this point, of thyroid disorder.

700
00:37:17.712 --> 00:37:18.384
<v ->Yes.</v>

701
00:37:18.384 --> 00:37:19.664
<v Regina>In the people.</v>

702
00:37:19.664 --> 00:37:23.450
<v ->And it is the energy that is shifting here.</v>

703
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.935
<v Regina>And not just the thyroid but other glands</v>

704
00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:29.135
and I wanted to get into the glandular system with you

705
00:37:29.135 --> 00:37:32.271
because it seems that this is really a very important

706
00:37:32.271 --> 00:37:36.825
interface between the new energies and the new information

707
00:37:36.825 --> 00:37:39.492
that is making itself available to us.

708
00:37:39.492 --> 00:37:42.094
It seems that a major point of entry

709
00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:46.276
are these very delicate but powerful master glands

710
00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:48.622
and there seems to be on this planet

711
00:37:48.622 --> 00:37:52.035
people who are now developing an entirely different

712
00:37:52.035 --> 00:37:54.766
kind of pituitary for example.

713
00:37:54.766 --> 00:37:57.390
A much larger pituitary.

714
00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:02.083
Can you talk about this transitioning of our glands?

715
00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:07.083
<v ->The pituitary is a highly functioning gland</v>

716
00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:11.949
for the entirety of the body and it is also

717
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:16.949
that which increases the functionality of the brain

718
00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:20.705
and what you would find as it is enlarged

719
00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:24.652
is also as many know where it is, the seeing

720
00:38:24.652 --> 00:38:29.652
the third eye, the sensitive place of being

721
00:38:29.942 --> 00:38:34.241
because it is a key component to the entirety

722
00:38:34.241 --> 00:38:39.241
of the physical body, but also the brain.

723
00:38:39.606 --> 00:38:44.606
And it speaks to the brain, how to function properly.

724
00:38:45.898 --> 00:38:46.784
Do you see?

725
00:38:46.784 --> 00:38:48.682
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

726
00:38:48.682 --> 00:38:53.514
And so as we progress on this physical shift

727
00:38:53.514 --> 00:38:58.484
into our, call it human 2.0 or what not,

728
00:38:58.484 --> 00:39:01.641
this evolvement of the pituitary is evolving us

729
00:39:01.641 --> 00:39:05.186
toward what end?

730
00:39:05.186 --> 00:39:08.000
<v ->The full expression of your masterhood.</v>

731
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.049
Awareness, total awareness.

732
00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.513
<v Regina>So as our pituitaries begin expanding,</v>

733
00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:16.371
there may be some period of time during this

734
00:39:16.371 --> 00:39:19.198
evolutionary period, this intense period,

735
00:39:19.198 --> 00:39:22.312
where the pituitary may be finding itself in a different

736
00:39:22.312 --> 00:39:24.893
frequency range and maybe even out of sync

737
00:39:24.893 --> 00:39:28.466
with the other glands as sort of the scout

738
00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:32.114
or pre-runner or the first master gland that must

739
00:39:32.114 --> 00:39:34.290
be developed in this process.

740
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.157
I don't quite know how to articulate

741
00:39:36.157 --> 00:39:39.356
what I'm saying but, you can probably see

742
00:39:39.356 --> 00:39:40.540
what I'm saying.

743
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:45.351
<v ->It will adjust in this time and it will alllow</v>

744
00:39:45.351 --> 00:39:49.180
the body to adjust to the frequencies.

745
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.084
It will be not out of sync unless beings are not

746
00:39:53.084 --> 00:39:57.169
attentive to caring for their physical body.

747
00:39:57.169 --> 00:39:58.374
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

748
00:39:58.374 --> 00:40:00.699
<v ->Beings will not have a problem with it</v>

749
00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:05.699
unless they're not attentive.

750
00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:09.328
<v Regina>Yes, well these are all natural phenomena</v>

751
00:40:09.328 --> 00:40:12.165
we're talking about, these changes around us

752
00:40:12.165 --> 00:40:14.256
are natural electrical field and the need

753
00:40:14.256 --> 00:40:16.367
to support it through mineral supplementation

754
00:40:16.367 --> 00:40:19.151
and so forth, but another thing that's occurring

755
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:23.652
is more man produced electricity.

756
00:40:23.652 --> 00:40:28.474
Heavy electronics in the home, heavy electrical fields,

757
00:40:28.474 --> 00:40:33.305
electromagnetic fields, some of it exotic technologies even.

758
00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:37.412
How is this impacting the human being

759
00:40:37.412 --> 00:40:41.753
as we're in this very delicate state, profound state,

760
00:40:41.753 --> 00:40:45.091
where we're already electrically depleted?

761
00:40:45.091 --> 00:40:47.672
<v ->that is why we're saying you do the supplementation</v>

762
00:40:47.672 --> 00:40:51.224
to maintain the body in its' fullest state

763
00:40:51.224 --> 00:40:55.266
because this is what is supposed to be happening.

764
00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:57.005
Evolutionarily.

765
00:40:57.005 --> 00:40:59.117
<v Regina>Yes, and what about the artificial stimulation</v>

766
00:40:59.117 --> 00:41:01.655
of living in heavy electrical fields we've created

767
00:41:01.655 --> 00:41:03.853
through our appliances?

768
00:41:03.853 --> 00:41:07.639
<v ->And why is this being created?</v>

769
00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:10.497
Not to think of it as a negative.

770
00:41:10.497 --> 00:41:13.377
This is an evolutionary fact.

771
00:41:13.377 --> 00:41:18.377
And the body is adjusting to it.

772
00:41:19.254 --> 00:41:20.737
Do you see?

773
00:41:20.737 --> 00:41:22.433
So if you think it's going to harm you,

774
00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:23.403
what will it do?

775
00:41:23.403 --> 00:41:24.545
<v Regina>Harm you, yeah.</v>

776
00:41:24.545 --> 00:41:27.208
<v ->Because it is in the thought field,</v>

777
00:41:27.208 --> 00:41:29.832
that is the creation.

778
00:41:29.832 --> 00:41:33.026
If you say ah ha, this is what is occurring and I

779
00:41:33.026 --> 00:41:34.583
will care for my physical body,

780
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:37.740
I will feed it properly, I will give it the nutrition

781
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:42.007
that it needs, I will exercise, I will give it oxygenation

782
00:41:42.007 --> 00:41:46.220
and the body will adjust to its' environment

783
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.950
without harm.

784
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.371
<v Regina>That's a very good point to be made</v>

785
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:54.155
because much fear is being produced around

786
00:41:54.155 --> 00:41:58.283
the subject of the electronics that we live within

787
00:41:58.283 --> 00:41:59.382
and this is our world.

788
00:41:59.382 --> 00:42:01.771
We've created them for our convenience.

789
00:42:01.771 --> 00:42:02.635
<v ->Yes.</v>

790
00:42:02.635 --> 00:42:03.285
<v Regina>So it makes sense.</v>

791
00:42:03.285 --> 00:42:05.856
If we re mineralize and do the natural sorts

792
00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.178
of things you're talking about,

793
00:42:07.178 --> 00:42:09.173
we should be able to adapt to this,

794
00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:12.842
these what we're now perceiving as stressors.

795
00:42:12.842 --> 00:42:14.453
<v ->Yes.</v>

796
00:42:14.453 --> 00:42:17.972
And believing that it's a stressor will make it so.

797
00:42:17.972 --> 00:42:19.466
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

798
00:42:19.466 --> 00:42:21.460
<v ->Change the thought.</v>

799
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.129
<v Regina>To be in harmony with our creations.</v>

800
00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:27.476
<v ->Affirm that your body's whole, healthy,</v>

801
00:42:27.476 --> 00:42:31.284
functioning perfectly.

802
00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:34.761
<v Regina>Mmm-hmm.</v>

803
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:37.161
You spoke of oxygen a moment ago,

804
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:40.851
now how does what you just said

805
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:45.747
play into the also physical reality?

806
00:42:45.747 --> 00:42:48.253
We do have some oxygen depletion on the planet

807
00:42:48.253 --> 00:42:52.946
which is really part impartial to our metabolic system

808
00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:54.685
is the need for oxygen.

809
00:42:54.685 --> 00:42:58.311
Are our bodies adapting to lower oxygen levels

810
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:00.306
as they're adapting to the electrical fields

811
00:43:00.306 --> 00:43:01.671
and everything else?

812
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:03.975
<v ->Because of the education of your technology</v>

813
00:43:03.975 --> 00:43:06.407
and there is this global conversation that

814
00:43:06.407 --> 00:43:09.916
is being had now, there's an awareness

815
00:43:09.916 --> 00:43:13.350
to protect environment and the ozone layers

816
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.073
which is your oxygen, is it not?

817
00:43:17.073 --> 00:43:20.779
So then you become aware of what is necessary,

818
00:43:20.779 --> 00:43:25.779
such as the plants, the trees, that produce oxygen

819
00:43:27.685 --> 00:43:29.893
and cleanse the air.

820
00:43:29.893 --> 00:43:32.581
So as you move forward with this education

821
00:43:32.581 --> 00:43:36.112
and this awareness note that in this time

822
00:43:36.112 --> 00:43:39.642
of great change in global community that is coming about,

823
00:43:39.642 --> 00:43:43.076
the sciences will be leaders.

824
00:43:43.076 --> 00:43:48.076
The scientists will bring about the knowledge of change

825
00:43:48.164 --> 00:43:53.164
and in done right by humanity in truth

826
00:43:53.988 --> 00:43:58.988
rather than fear mongering for control.

827
00:43:59.257 --> 00:44:01.817
When beings are aware of what they can do

828
00:44:01.817 --> 00:44:05.603
and it's already been proven so in many areas,

829
00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:08.451
they do it.

830
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:09.176
Do you understand?

831
00:44:09.176 --> 00:44:12.312
They care for their environment.

832
00:44:12.312 --> 00:44:14.328
They care for their habitat.

833
00:44:14.328 --> 00:44:19.328
They care for each other and with the technological

834
00:44:20.503 --> 00:44:24.940
connectivity that is only going to expand,

835
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.236
the global community comes together

836
00:44:28.236 --> 00:44:33.236
and it is by the people that these changes come about.

837
00:44:33.996 --> 00:44:37.014
And the political structures change

838
00:44:37.014 --> 00:44:39.521
by the people.

839
00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:44.521
The old forms don't work, new ones will be implemented.

840
00:44:44.977 --> 00:44:47.584
And you've already begun to see

841
00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:51.040
those requests coming forth in the desire

842
00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.040
in the hearts of all humans for this change,

843
00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:58.816
because they're being affected by it.

844
00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:03.413
If they had not been awakened, the apathy

845
00:45:03.413 --> 00:45:08.112
would continue and the control as such.

846
00:45:10.642 --> 00:45:13.641
<v Regina>Along that line, in the book that Sheila wrote</v>

847
00:45:13.641 --> 00:45:16.425
called The Fifth Dimension, many years ago

848
00:45:16.425 --> 00:45:20.020
in the 80's, I was noticing that you had told

849
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.206
of some of the political changes that were coming

850
00:45:22.206 --> 00:45:24.649
that of course all came to pass including

851
00:45:24.649 --> 00:45:29.128
the dissolution and dissolving of the soviet block

852
00:45:29.128 --> 00:45:30.312
and so forth.

853
00:45:30.312 --> 00:45:33.811
What do you see right now as a primary shift

854
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:37.043
that is getting ready on a very positive level

855
00:45:37.043 --> 00:45:39.112
to happen for humanity?

856
00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:41.682
<v ->What comes and you've already been bearing</v>

857
00:45:41.682 --> 00:45:44.520
witness to this, is a global economic structure.

858
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.005
There have been meeting after meeting

859
00:45:47.005 --> 00:45:51.698
of world leaders to bring about this global economy.

860
00:45:51.698 --> 00:45:54.898
Many fear this because they fear control

861
00:45:54.898 --> 00:45:57.820
and conspiracy but it's necessary to bring about

862
00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.497
and you've already witnessed that you are

863
00:46:00.497 --> 00:46:01.489
a global economy.

864
00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:05.745
Now to have it in place that is to benefit all humanity

865
00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:07.974
is what is necessary.

866
00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:09.126
Do you see?

867
00:46:09.126 --> 00:46:10.918
And that does come to fruition.

868
00:46:10.918 --> 00:46:13.798
As to the political structures there comes about

869
00:46:13.798 --> 00:46:18.798
a political body if you would, much like the United Nations

870
00:46:19.259 --> 00:46:24.259
but with more power and it is a communicative process,

871
00:46:25.648 --> 00:46:30.648
an agreement process, a consensus process.

872
00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:36.602
And as this has begun in the United States

873
00:46:36.602 --> 00:46:41.602
with your present president, who is not a nationalist,

874
00:46:42.127 --> 00:46:46.894
he's a globalist, he's brought forth

875
00:46:46.894 --> 00:46:49.422
the awareness to many and some wish

876
00:46:49.422 --> 00:46:53.859
to defer this is wrong, the necessity of communication

877
00:46:53.859 --> 00:46:57.176
with each other around the world.

878
00:46:57.176 --> 00:47:02.176
And combining so that it is a world of the people

879
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:09.762
and that humans can exist on this planet

880
00:47:09.762 --> 00:47:12.130
in health and well being.

881
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.338
Yes?

882
00:47:14.338 --> 00:47:19.276
So rather than judge and blame,

883
00:47:19.276 --> 00:47:24.276
these are the old edicts, empower those who

884
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:30.921
seek this balance and become a participant in it.

885
00:47:33.953 --> 00:47:35.553
Yes?

886
00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:37.419
You may ask?

887
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:41.707
<v Regina>I believe that most people have no objection</v>

888
00:47:41.707 --> 00:47:45.547
to that and you hit it earlier when you said the fear is

889
00:47:45.547 --> 00:47:48.309
that this same type of mentality that are called

890
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:50.784
architects of control in some parliaments,

891
00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:54.410
those who seek to control for control, greed,

892
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.429
power's sake would be the very same ones

893
00:47:57.429 --> 00:48:00.052
that would be controlling these new structures.

894
00:48:00.052 --> 00:48:03.839
What do you see the actual outcome as?

895
00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:06.164
<v ->Many fear that that would be so</v>

896
00:48:06.164 --> 00:48:11.164
but with the knowledge and with all of these

897
00:48:12.009 --> 00:48:14.430
deceptions coming to the surface to be seen

898
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:19.430
for what they are, the people beings will not

899
00:48:20.904 --> 00:48:23.368
allow for that.

900
00:48:23.368 --> 00:48:26.568
<v Regina>Yes this is, this is a very wonderful aspect</v>

901
00:48:26.568 --> 00:48:28.477
of what is also going on.

902
00:48:28.477 --> 00:48:30.056
<v ->It is.</v>

903
00:48:30.056 --> 00:48:33.042
It is a blessing.

904
00:48:33.042 --> 00:48:37.021
To be enjoyed, not to be feared.

905
00:48:37.021 --> 00:48:40.796
<v Regina>So for the people to choose</v>

906
00:48:40.796 --> 00:48:44.978
sovereignty, individually in their own being,

907
00:48:44.978 --> 00:48:47.121
take responsibility for their own lives,

908
00:48:47.121 --> 00:48:49.457
their own development, and at the same time

909
00:48:49.457 --> 00:48:52.508
join together globally for the highest and best

910
00:48:52.508 --> 00:48:55.548
good of all, is not just the desired outcome,

911
00:48:55.548 --> 00:48:58.651
but the outcome that you do see coming to pass?

912
00:48:58.651 --> 00:49:00.635
<v ->That's correct.</v>

913
00:49:00.635 --> 00:49:03.419
<v Regina>And do you see, I know timeframes are</v>

914
00:49:03.419 --> 00:49:04.603
always difficult.

915
00:49:04.603 --> 00:49:06.832
Time on one level, time doesn't exist

916
00:49:06.832 --> 00:49:09.104
in the way we think of it, but is it something

917
00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:12.261
relatively near to us now that's drawing near

918
00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:15.888
within most of our lifetimes?

919
00:49:15.888 --> 00:49:18.927
<v ->We see it as now, yes.</v>

920
00:49:18.927 --> 00:49:19.717
<v Regina>Yes, okay.</v>

921
00:49:19.717 --> 00:49:22.383
<v ->And many who live now will experience it,</v>

922
00:49:22.383 --> 00:49:25.284
not all.

923
00:49:25.284 --> 00:49:27.215
<v Regina>But again, it's coming down to our taking</v>

924
00:49:27.215 --> 00:49:29.284
the personal responsibility.

925
00:49:29.284 --> 00:49:30.447
<v ->Yes.</v>

926
00:49:30.447 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Regina>The power, absolutely back into our own hands.</v>

927
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.860
<v ->Correct.</v>

928
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.596
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

929
00:49:34.596 --> 00:49:36.110
<v ->And dealing with your own issues.</v>

930
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.897
Coming into the wholeness of your being,

931
00:49:39.897 --> 00:49:41.987
dealing with the terrorist within you

932
00:49:41.987 --> 00:49:44.814
rather than the terrorist without you.

933
00:49:44.814 --> 00:49:45.742
Do you understand?

934
00:49:45.742 --> 00:49:47.811
<v Regina>Yes, we each have these traits in ourselves</v>

935
00:49:47.811 --> 00:49:50.925
that are motivated by fear and desperation.

936
00:49:50.925 --> 00:49:55.448
<v ->Yes, so it is as one takes responsibility</v>

937
00:49:55.448 --> 00:50:00.448
for their evolution of consciousness.

938
00:50:01.026 --> 00:50:03.671
There comes about this radiance of peace

939
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:07.916
in the world as each being takes responsible

940
00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:10.447
for that within.

941
00:50:14.657 --> 00:50:17.484
<v Regina>I was going to ask you this earlier</v>

942
00:50:17.484 --> 00:50:20.844
so it takes the energy back to the personal,

943
00:50:20.844 --> 00:50:23.329
human level.

944
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:26.347
In the expression of this in our own DNA,

945
00:50:26.347 --> 00:50:28.992
as you just spoke about what our world will be

946
00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:33.269
into the future, what is the human being

947
00:50:33.269 --> 00:50:34.987
going to be like into the future?

948
00:50:34.987 --> 00:50:37.376
Are there traits that we are developing physically

949
00:50:37.376 --> 00:50:39.562
for example or releasing physically

950
00:50:39.562 --> 00:50:43.509
that will be present into the future?

951
00:50:43.509 --> 00:50:46.037
<v ->Aging.</v>

952
00:50:46.037 --> 00:50:48.085
<v Regina>We will not be aging in the same way?</v>

953
00:50:48.085 --> 00:50:50.079
<v ->Correct.</v>

954
00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:51.615
<v Regina>And that's because of these frequencies</v>

955
00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:55.604
and also what, letting go of the conflict within?

956
00:50:55.604 --> 00:50:57.545
<v ->It's coming to that peace within</v>

957
00:50:57.545 --> 00:51:01.716
and that self-acceptance, self-love as some might say,

958
00:51:01.716 --> 00:51:05.577
yes, the acceptance of self that allows

959
00:51:05.577 --> 00:51:10.577
a relinquishment of angst and stress.

960
00:51:12.147 --> 00:51:13.790
<v Regina>And so what would our lifespan be</v>

961
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:17.043
in the future human for example?

962
00:51:17.043 --> 00:51:20.531
<v ->As many as 200 years.</v>

963
00:51:22.381 --> 00:51:23.922
<v Regina>And would that also be in part</v>

964
00:51:23.922 --> 00:51:27.847
because we will have created a system that is

965
00:51:27.847 --> 00:51:30.279
in support of life for all?

966
00:51:30.279 --> 00:51:30.909
<v ->Yes.</v>

967
00:51:30.909 --> 00:51:32.370
<v Regina>So the angst simply won't be there.</v>

968
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:34.396
The competition and the greed that pits us

969
00:51:34.396 --> 00:51:36.924
against each other and makes us fear we're not

970
00:51:36.924 --> 00:51:38.855
capable of our own survival?

971
00:51:38.855 --> 00:51:43.855
<v ->And there is that but there is also with your sciences</v>

972
00:51:44.465 --> 00:51:49.465
and your technology, new forms of energies

973
00:51:49.553 --> 00:51:53.947
that allow the body to be in its' optimum healthful state.

974
00:51:53.947 --> 00:51:55.920
<v Regina>Do you care to elaborate on that?</v>

975
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.168
<v ->We cannot.</v>

976
00:51:57.168 --> 00:51:58.192
<v Regina>Not at this time.</v>

977
00:51:58.192 --> 00:52:01.136
<v ->It's being developed at this time.</v>

978
00:52:01.136 --> 00:52:02.864
<v Regina>Yes, I understand.</v>

979
00:52:02.864 --> 00:52:05.733
I was going to get into a whole line of questioning

980
00:52:05.733 --> 00:52:07.994
on the free energies and such, but the fact is

981
00:52:07.994 --> 00:52:12.101
they are already underway and do exist.

982
00:52:12.101 --> 00:52:14.767
These are political issues really at the time, so.

983
00:52:14.767 --> 00:52:16.047
<v ->Yes.</v>

984
00:52:16.047 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Regina>Yes, so to bring this to a close,</v>

985
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.476
can you tell us about the genuine profundity

986
00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:30.467
of what we have chosen to experience in this lifetime

987
00:52:30.467 --> 00:52:35.467
at this time in earth's evolution, evolutionary path?

988
00:52:36.046 --> 00:52:39.331
<v ->It is a glorious time to be alive.</v>

989
00:52:39.331 --> 00:52:42.307
To experience masterfulness.

990
00:52:42.307 --> 00:52:46.317
The ability to use all your power and awareness.

991
00:52:46.317 --> 00:52:50.125
Not in a negative sense, but knowing that you

992
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:55.010
are the god that you are, the master that you are,

993
00:52:55.010 --> 00:53:00.010
and you have total anonymity to that,

994
00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:04.684
though you share it with others.

995
00:53:04.684 --> 00:53:07.841
That you are an individual with great power

996
00:53:07.841 --> 00:53:09.750
but so is another.

997
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.878
It is a time of grand experiencing.

998
00:53:13.878 --> 00:53:18.878
Awakening, yes you can do all of the miracles

999
00:53:20.246 --> 00:53:23.051
that you desire to do.

1000
00:53:23.051 --> 00:53:26.240
To manipulate energetics for manifestations

1001
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:31.240
to arrive at a frequency of acceptance

1002
00:53:31.946 --> 00:53:35.775
that allows you to live as you wish to be

1003
00:53:35.775 --> 00:53:39.935
and that is blessed.

1004
00:53:39.935 --> 00:53:42.932
<v Regina>And I've heard you say many times,</v>

1005
00:53:42.932 --> 00:53:46.271
one of the key components in being able

1006
00:53:46.271 --> 00:53:48.831
to develop this awareness or remember this

1007
00:53:48.831 --> 00:53:51.796
remembrance in our being as well is that we

1008
00:53:51.796 --> 00:53:56.094
have to find time to quiet the mind and experience ourself

1009
00:53:56.094 --> 00:54:00.734
in a broad term, in meditative state.

1010
00:54:00.734 --> 00:54:02.195
<v ->Correct.</v>

1011
00:54:02.195 --> 00:54:04.179
<v Regina>Can you just briefly talk about</v>

1012
00:54:04.179 --> 00:54:08.627
why this is so, so important to our advancement?

1013
00:54:08.627 --> 00:54:11.529
<v ->It's a natural state for humanity.</v>

1014
00:54:11.529 --> 00:54:16.529
If you have ever daydreamed, sat quieting the self,

1015
00:54:17.693 --> 00:54:20.615
looking out of a window, or looking at something

1016
00:54:20.615 --> 00:54:25.330
and losing time and space, that is a meditation.

1017
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:28.721
Many have been judged harshly that they are

1018
00:54:28.721 --> 00:54:33.340
daydreamers or all should be.

1019
00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.561
That is a meditative state that is natural

1020
00:54:36.561 --> 00:54:38.353
to the human experience.

1021
00:54:38.353 --> 00:54:40.817
It is not something to be feared, but something

1022
00:54:40.817 --> 00:54:44.998
to be enjoyed that allows physically a rest

1023
00:54:44.998 --> 00:54:48.614
for the entirety of the body and the organs

1024
00:54:48.614 --> 00:54:52.773
and the nervous system, but allows one to become

1025
00:54:52.773 --> 00:54:56.506
aware of all that is.

1026
00:54:56.506 --> 00:54:59.408
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1027
00:54:59.408 --> 00:55:02.543
Well Theo, anything else you can see here

1028
00:55:02.543 --> 00:55:05.754
that might be appropriate as a final comment?

1029
00:55:05.754 --> 00:55:07.194
<v ->Well there's much to be seen</v>

1030
00:55:07.194 --> 00:55:09.210
but there's been much given for thought

1031
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:10.511
in this sitting.

1032
00:55:10.511 --> 00:55:11.204
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1033
00:55:11.204 --> 00:55:13.508
<v ->We are complete for this moment.</v>

1034
00:55:13.508 --> 00:55:14.969
<v Regina>Thank you very much, Theo.</v>

1035
00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:19.844
<v ->God's love unto you, good day.</v>

1036
00:55:19.844 --> 00:55:22.141
<v Regina>Good day.</v>

1037
00:55:29.731 --> 00:55:30.755
There she is.

1038
00:55:30.755 --> 00:55:31.757
<v ->Hi.</v>

1039
00:55:31.757 --> 00:55:33.005
<v Regina>Nicely rested.</v>

1040
00:55:33.005 --> 00:55:35.864
Well I think we had a really, a really nice conversation.

1041
00:55:35.864 --> 00:55:38.018
It was very, very full.

1042
00:55:38.018 --> 00:55:40.952
As Theo just said, much to think about.

1043
00:55:40.952 --> 00:55:41.944
<v ->Oh, good, good.</v>

1044
00:55:41.944 --> 00:55:45.591
<v Regina>And I'm very appreciative of you</v>

1045
00:55:45.591 --> 00:55:48.748
giving us your time and sitting with us to do this, Sheila

1046
00:55:48.748 --> 00:55:50.796
because this is still your time, your body,

1047
00:55:50.796 --> 00:55:52.460
and you have a choice in this, and I very much

1048
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.225
appreciate it because calmness is what is in my opinion

1049
00:55:56.225 --> 00:55:57.687
the greatest thing needed.

1050
00:55:57.687 --> 00:56:02.573
A beautiful overview and a calmness to

1051
00:56:02.573 --> 00:56:06.198
be able to contend with what appears to be the chaos.

1052
00:56:06.198 --> 00:56:09.355
<v ->Yes, very much so and I appreciate the opportunity</v>

1053
00:56:09.355 --> 00:56:14.112
to share Theo with you and the world.

1054
00:56:14.112 --> 00:56:14.880
<v Regina>Thank you, Sheila.</v>

1055
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.549
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1056
00:56:18.848 --> 00:56:21.653
<v ->To contact Sheila and Marcus Gillette directly</v>
