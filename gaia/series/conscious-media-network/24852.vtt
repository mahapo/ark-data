00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This was one of my favorite
interviews of the year.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Many of us know that
something is terribly

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.410 align:middle line:84%
wrong with the unnatural
way in which we're

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.580 align:middle line:90%
living on the Earth.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We've created an artificial
environment for life

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.320 align:middle line:84%
in virtually every
way, including--

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and especially--
our food supplies.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The deepening crisis
of manufactured food

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and its effect on the
human body and mind

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:90%
is evidenced everywhere.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Leonid Sharashkin is a
lifelong gardener from Russia

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that is also the publisher
of the English edition

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of "The Ringing
Cedars" series of books

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
about the wisdom of a Siberian
woman named Anastasia.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The stories are profound
and have left everybody

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:90%
wondering who Anastasia is.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I first became aware of the
work that you represent--

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and I have to clarify
that a little later on.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:10%
You represent a lot of things,
but "The Ringing Cedars" series

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.475 align:middle line:10%
from a girlfriend
that said, have

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:10%
you read "The Ringing
Cedars" series

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:10%
yet and heard about the words,
the wisdom of Anastasia?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.946 align:middle line:90%
And I had to admit I hadn't.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So when I came to
the conference,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I was thrilled to
see that you were

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
here and that series of books
and got an immediate rush when

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:90%
I saw the cover of the books.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
They're very childlike
and playful and whimsical.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
the Anastasia series,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:84%
"The Ringing Cedar"
series of books

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
is all about, because
this is just fascinating.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be very hard to say
what it is about because it is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
basically about everything.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But it tells the story of a
Russian entrepreneur named

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Vladimir Megre who,
in 1994 and 1995,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:84%
was undertaking trading
expeditions in Siberia

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and was going to
very remote places,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:90%
trading with local people.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And on one of the streets, he
heard fascinating local legends

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:84%
about ringing cedar
trees, the trees

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that accumulate so much energy
that they start vibrating.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And a piece of this cedar
wood worn on one's body

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
could improve health and
even make a person happier.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
He disregarded these legends
and dismissed them as fantasy.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But when he came
back from that trip,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
he started researching on the
properties of the Siberian

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
cedar and realized
that these trees got

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
huge commercial potential, that
produce the Siberian pine nuts

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and the everything of this
tree-- the root, the needles,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the bark have great
medicinal properties

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
that are known in this area
for thousands of years,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:84%
even before Europeans
and Russians arrived.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So being a keen
entrepreneur that he is,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
he decided to set up
another expedition

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and go back to this area and
to find this ringing cedar

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
tree to see how he could cash
in on commercializing it.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was totally about
money for him at this point?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have an impression
that it's still the same case.

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But let me ask a quick
question right here.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
He says in the
first book that he

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:90%
encounters these two old men--

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> That give him
this information.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Did that part even happen, that
he encountered two old men?

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.117 align:middle line:84%
Is that who told him about
the lore or how did that go?

00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:90%
How did he find out?

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't pretend to know
much more than what is written

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:90%
in the books.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Vladimir Megre himself maintains
that this is a real life story

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and a documentary account.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
What we know for sure is that
he was a well-known entrepreneur

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
in this part of Siberia, that
during these two years, he did

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
take these expeditions up and
down the Siberian river, Ob.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But whether he, during
this trip, met somebody

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
or whether there were
some other kind of source

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
for this information and
for this inspiration,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:90%
it's up to the reader to judge.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why in the
first book it says--

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
the main character,
Anastasia, says--

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I exist for those
for whom I exist,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and these books are fascinating
in that they can be read either

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
as a factual documentary
account or a novel,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:90%
but they're neither.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
This question becomes
even irrelevant

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
when you consider the
messages that these books are

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to convey.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really true.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
does Anastasia mean?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Anastasia in Greek
means Resurrection.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But actually the root,
anasta, comes from Sanskrit.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And not many people know
that Sanskrit and Russian are

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%
very closely related languages.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Up to the present day, they
have some common roots.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And anasta in Sanskrit
means incorruptible,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
something that is so pure
that it cannot be soiled.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So basically the
word Anastasia is

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
a symbol of purity and light.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the point you make
is quite interesting.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether Vladimir has
actually documented something

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
or whether he has come
about this information

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
through other extraordinary
means is really not relevant

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
when you're reading this
information in one sense,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:90%
is it?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What I can tell from
personally knowing the author,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't give an
impression of an individual who

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:90%
could invent the story.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
He describes himself very
honestly in the books

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and we need to give
him credit for that.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:90%
He smokes.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:90%
He enjoys a drink or--

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Likes women.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> He's not indifferent
towards women.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So he is just a
normal entrepreneur

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
who enjoys life and tries
to get everything out of it.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So the second time
he goes back, he's

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
going to really squeeze
it for all he can.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.244 align:middle line:90%
He's going to get the nuts.

00:05:41.244 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
He's going to get
the wood, the oil.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> According to his account,
he meets the granddaughter

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
of the elders to whom he
had talked the year before.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And this woman named
Anastasia wants

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
him to spend three days
with her in the depth

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:90%
of the wild forest.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
He accepts the
invitation because he

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is keen to see this
ringing cedar tree

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and to see how it could be cut
down, transported to the city,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and then sawed into
small pieces and sold.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But his experiences during
these three days with Anastasia

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
change his world
view so dramatically,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
because she exhibits knowledge
and feelings and wisdom so

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
unfamiliar to our
modern civilization

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that he, at her request,
drops everything, abandons

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
his business,
abandons his family,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and leaves from
Siberia to Moscow

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to write a series of books
about his experiences with her.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all I can say
is, whatever happened,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.227 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad he did it.

00:06:48.227 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happened those first three days

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:90%
a little bit--

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
from the first book
called "Anastasia," just

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:84%
to kind of set the
framework for the types

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of wisdoms that are revealed
in a series of eight books.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, now there will
be nine, you say?

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
There's another
new one coming out?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's considered the second
part of the book eight,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's the ninth volume.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened to
him during these days,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:90%
these three days?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, here he is, this
entrepreneur with his very

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
materialistic mindset in the
company of a younger, blonde,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
attractive woman who lives
there in the depth of the taiga

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:90%
without any modern amenities.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
When he arrived to
her home, he couldn't

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
see any kind of man-made shelter
and she was not even allowing

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
him to light the fire.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the
word taiga for a moment,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
because I think a lot of people
outside of Russia don't know

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:90%
what that means.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Taiga is the northern forest.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Basically it's a
conifer forest-- fir

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:84%
trees and pine trees
and large trees,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
which is predominant
throughout most of the Siberia

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%
and in parts of northern Canada.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:10%
>> So he's now out in
the conifers with her,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:10%
out in the forest at her home
place and he can't see a home

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:10%
or anything else
for that matter.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And she even thinks
that this is where

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
she lives and this is where
she had lived all her life.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And he gets a shock
and even wants

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
to run back to the
bank of the river

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to be picked up
by his steamboat.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But her-- the sheer abnormality
of the whole situation

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
makes him stay because he is
keen to discover this tree

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
and to learn more.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And he witnesses the amazing
harmonious interaction

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that Anastasia enjoys with
plants and animals on the way

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:90%
that she lives.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Squirrels bring her
food to eat and she

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is not concerned about providing
for her food or for her shelter

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and sleeps in one of
the dugouts that are

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:90%
prepared for her by the bear.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And sometimes with bears.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:90%
This was his first experience.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
To keep him warm,
she invited him

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to sleep in the same
dugout with the bear

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and he thought it
was just the pelt,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
but it turned out that
it was a living creature.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it may
sound too far out.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But people who are
familiar with this region,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you that many
local people can communicate

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
with the local
wildlife, with bears,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and there is no fantastic in
his account up to this point.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's true even in even
in the Western world through

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the Disney-type of renditions
of this and movies of Snow White

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and Sleeping Beauty, where
they go into the forest,

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the one common denominator is
that the young woman is always

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
able to live in harmony with and
communicate with the animals,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
which growing up, I thought that
was the most beautiful thing

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:90%
imaginable.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So it must be some
recognition inside of us

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:90%
that is drawn to that.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:10%
Our own human capability
to be able to do this

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:10%
has to be innate to us.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, because this is
the image of the Paradise Lost.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And he starts to
discourage her lifestyle,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
which is shocking to him,
but she very patiently tried

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to explain to him in the very
simple terms that he would be

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
able to relate to how nature
of her lifestyle was and how

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in nature our civilization is
compared to the way she and her

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
ancestors had always lived
in this part of Siberia.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.293 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say--

00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So even when he says,
how do you keep warm?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is in the
40s and I wear a jacket

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and you wear virtually nothing
and doesn't seem to be cold,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
but she explained to him, well,
there are people in our society

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
who can be tolerant
of the cold and cited

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
an example of a famous proponent
of health through closeness

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to nature native to
Russia, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:84%
who was so tolerant to
cold he could work only

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:84%
in pants during Siberian winters
without any harm to his body.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So you know, just the whole
thing about his experience

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
is that what he initially
perceived as supernatural,

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:90%
something that was not--

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that was beyond the
limits of man's capability

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden seemed
very natural to him

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and he started to question
our own lifestyle instead.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And she goes on to talk about--

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
well, introduces many subjects
in the beginning, not the least

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
of which is how one
absorbs and accesses

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:90%
knowledge, which is fascinating.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But one of the areas that
you're deeply involved

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
in in your personal life, and
I'm very interested in right

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
now for all of our
sakes, is the notion

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:84%
of how we relate
to the plant world,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to agriculture,
growing our own food,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and even how to condition
the seeds so that they

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
are able to relate to your
body personally and sustain

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:90%
your health.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Can you go into that a bit?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
You're right that you say
that it is all-encompassing.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:90%
It goes over so many subjects.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
In this very first
book, you're exposed

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to ideas that range from
gardening to child-rearing,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
from relationships
and sexuality,

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to religion and the
meaning of human life.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But the two main
subjects that she herself

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed talking most about was
child-rearing and gardening,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
because she believed
that on these two,

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
the future of our
civilization depended.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And to Vladimir Megre
it was incomprehensible,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
because how can future
of our civilization

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
depend on such meaningless
things as gardening?

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
But she explained to him
that the food gardening,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
when you grow your
own food, it allows

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
you to establish a flow of
nourishment, information,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and energy from you to the
plant world and back to you.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And she exposed him to the
idea that actually plants

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
are custom made to suit
the needs of your body.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> To heal us personally.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> To heal you personally.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And actually this is something
we can observe in nature.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
It's rare to find a sickly
animal in the woods, right?

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more common to
find the sickly looking human

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:84%
when you walk into the
streets of a large city.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Why might that be?

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
She explained to him
that in nature, there

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
are inbuilt mechanisms
to keep all organisms

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:90%
and the whole ecosystem healthy.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
mechanisms is the flow

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of information and nourishment
from one organism to the other.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's say in a particular
area of the Earth,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
there is a warm,
prolonged winter.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And the nature
starts understanding

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that the summer is likely to
be very hot, very dry, and very

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
What that creates
in the ecosystem

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that plants and other organisms
have natural mechanisms

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to adjust their bodies
and adjust their fruit

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to match these particular
weather conditions

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:90%
during this particular year.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
that a vegetable

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that you grow in your
backyard will be different

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
depending on the amount
of warmth and sunshine

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and the water that you get
in a particular season.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's just natural
and common knowledge.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But she explains that,
well, in your civilization,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
you are disconnected from the
source of your nourishment.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And you may live in
the cold climates

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
but consume fruits,
vegetables, and other food that

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
comes from a hot climate
where this food was grown

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
by nature to satisfy
the needs of bodies

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:90%
in that particular client.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's disconnect
in both time

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
because we can
eat out the season

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and we have all the food
fruit and all the vegetables

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and all the foods
year round today,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and in space, because
we can have food

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So it prevents you from tapping
into this natural mechanism

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:90%
of self-sustaining health.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:84%
If you provide plants with the
information about your body

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:84%
by applying some small amount
of matter from your body--

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:90%
for example, sweat.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
If you wash your feet and
then water your garden mass

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
with this water,
then you provide

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the plants that grow
there with information

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:90%
on your bodily needs.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And the plants
have an opportunity

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
to modify the chemical
composition of the fruit that

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:84%
grow to match the
needs of your body.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So in a very direct sense,
food, if you grow it yourself,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:90%
can be custom made for you.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And she recommended amazing
simple gardening techniques

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
when, even in our civilized
world, even in your backyard

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
or if you have none, even on the
window sill of your apartment,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
you can plant seeds that
would eventually grow food

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:90%
to heal your body and spirit.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really amazing that
she's bringing up the notion

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible symbiotic
relationship between the--

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
like as a collective agreement
between the plant world

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and the animal world for
this purpose of healing.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
first of all, as I

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
was reading this
book, everything

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:90%
felt correct intuitively for me.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I was able to verify
this by scientific sources.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.918 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to know.

00:17:01.918 --> 00:17:02.926 align:middle line:90%
How has this been done?

00:17:02.926 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about some of
the methods in a little bit.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:90%
What have you found out?

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are a number
of Russian scientists who were

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
researching--

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
one of them, Mikhail Prokhorov,
referred to in the books

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
as well, was researching
the role of bacteria

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:90%
to human adaptation.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered that while
our body, in particular

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
our intestine, is inhabited by
a whole range of bacteria who--

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- when we defecate,
get into the environment.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But this is a natural means
to convey the information

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
about our state of
being to the environment

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
so that the bacteria in the
soil can receive information.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
scientist who

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
studied the bio-communication
and the information exchanged

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.155 align:middle line:84%
between bacteria and
who showed that there

00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
is the transfer of
information from bacteria,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:90%
even though different varieties.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So if the waste
flow of your bodily

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
matter into the
soil of your garden,

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:84%
then the bacteria who are
responsible for nourishing

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
the plants and making
nutrients in the soil

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
available to the plants, they
will get this information

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:84%
from the bacteria
coming from your body.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Why is it important?

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
For a simple reason that
the lifespan of a bacteria

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
is between 15 and
40 minutes compared

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
to 50 to 80 years for man.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
What it means, that bacteria
can adapt much more rapidly

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to the changes in weather
and in the environment

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that we humans can.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And that there's a natural
mechanism provided to us so

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that we can stay healthy without
any special effort on our part.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how unusual some
of the information in Megre's

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
books are viewed at
first glance, when

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I started looking up scientific
literature, most of it

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:90%
was vindicated.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very interesting.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about the
seed process she talks about.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
to imbue the seeds--

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The seeds with
information about yourself.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And the steps you
would go through.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first step is to
put the seed for nine minutes

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:84%
into your mouth under your
tongue to let the saliva

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:90%
permeate it.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
What it does-- saliva has
as a different pH from water

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
so it already activates the
germination of the seed.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Then saliva is very
rich with bacteria

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
again, which carry
information about our body

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's bacteria
will be different depending

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.410 align:middle line:90%
on the state of your health.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Then temperature.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You have high temperature, which
also stimulates germination.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So she describes this
as a means of imbuing

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.676 align:middle line:84%
the seed with information
about your body's state.

00:19:46.676 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So you hold it in the
mouth for nine minutes,

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
then you take it out, put it in
between the palms of your hands

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and keep it there
for half a minute.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Lots of energy
transferred there.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And now today we
can, and science can,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
measure biological energy
fields of human beings

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and we all know that
vast flows of energy

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
flow through our
hands in particular.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Then present it to the sun.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know even from
the biological standpoint,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:84%
it makes perfect sense because
it's an additional kind

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:90%
of stimulation.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And she also, like
Rudolf Steiner

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that founder of
biodynamic agriculture

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that was so successful
over the years.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
She explains that
it's also a way

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to initiate the contact of the
seed with the celestial bodies.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Then breath on the
seeds, it's symbolic.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> You just do one breath or--

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Breath on the seed to
convey additional information.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And then plant it
on a spot where,

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
during the whole process, you
have been standing barefoot.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is also significant
because through the sweats

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and sweating of our feet, a
lot of toxins and bacteria

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
will leave and these
toxins come out.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's additional information
to the seeded plant

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:90%
about your bodily needs.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And then do not want water
this seed for three days so

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that it can absorb
your information rather

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:84%
than this information being
diluted by water you pour over.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And there regularly should
commence every evening,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:84%
wash your feet without any
soap and pour the water

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:90%
on your garden baths.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
everything she suggests.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.912 align:middle line:84%
>> And now you have been
gardening for 25 years.

00:21:30.912 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into some of this,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
because you're really part
of that Russian tradition.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And have you used some of
these techniques yourself?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I have.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And what have you found
in terms of the effects

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
of the food or the
qualities of the food.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only myself,
but many, many people,

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and the publisher of these books
in English, [INAUDIBLE] press,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
keep receiving accounts
of people who apply this

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:90%
technique.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just my experience.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
People report that food
becomes better tasting.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, it's not
abstractly better tasting.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:84%
What we hear is that
it is better tasting

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:90%
for this particular individual.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:90%
But this is what matters.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Different people will
have different tastes.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Somebody with one body
needs will enjoy sour apple

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and the other will need
and enjoy sweet apple.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is what seems to be
achieved by this technique

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and by maintaining this flow
of nourishment and information

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:90%
between you and your garden.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So what also many
people discard is

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that the plants become
drought tolerant, more drought

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.060 align:middle line:90%
tolerant.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the women
from Europe wrote

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to say that all neighbor's
gardens were dry,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and even though she
was not watering hers,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:90%
it was doing just fine.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> During a drought?

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:90%
During the drought.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's very hard to
measure the impact it has.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But if anything, it creates
the psychological link as well,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's not only about
the physical connection

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:90%
to the plant world.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, both this series of
books and scientific evidence

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
shows that there is this
psychological link that

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely essential
for our well-being.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:12.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, there have been
scientifically valid controlled

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:84%
studies where they've been
able to show that just looking

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
at green plants reduces
the blood pressure,

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that patients who have
windows overlooking a garden

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
recover faster from
surgery than patients

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:90%
who are deprived of this view.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we come to the
same ancient understanding that

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
was prevalent in all cultures of
the world even 2,000 years ago,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of nature, not
just in some abstract sense,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are really
embedded into it.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to live a
healthy and fulfilling life

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:84%
is understanding all these
natural mechanisms that

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:90%
were provided for our benefit.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes total sense.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of chronic
disease in the Western world,

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
in all the parts of the
world in which people

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
are no longer connected to
the earth, speaks to that.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you need to look any
further than in the winter,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in particular all the people
with runny noses and coughs

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and one sort of
ailment after another.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.322 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
people that live

00:24:10.322 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
close to the land in
Russia, where you're

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
talking about some
pretty harsh climates,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
same degree of illness

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
with people who are doing
their own gardening, do you?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you do not see.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And they're actually--

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Russia is such a
unique country where

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
70% of the population
today, and this

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:84%
is 35 million families,
both rich and poor,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
both urban and rural, grow their
own food in their food gardens.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And now we're talking about a
completely different attitude

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
towards your environment
and a complete different

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
meaning of the food

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:90%
and where it is coming from.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it
is also providing

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
an extremely
important safety net

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in times of economic hardship.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Think about our Western
society in the United

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:90%
States and elsewhere.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
We all depend on money
and monetary income

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to purchase the necessities, the
first necessity of life-- food.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And what if there is
an economic crisis?

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Then many people's livelihoods
will be jeopardized.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But Russians, for the
most part, are really

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
shielded from all
the economic calamity

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
just because they do not
depend on the market cash

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
economy for their staples
that they grow themselves.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I listened to you
give a talk yesterday,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and I have it here
somewhere on my paper,

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
but something like 50% of
all of the produce raised--

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Even more.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In Russia is from
backyard gardens.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>> People's gardens today
produce more food in all

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Russian federation,
more food than all commercial

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%
agriculture put together.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So gardens now produce 54%
and commercial agriculture

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:90%
produce the rest, 46%.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Also to produce this 54%
food, gardeners only 7%

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.005 align:middle line:84%
of the agricultural
land of the country.

00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:09.540 align:middle line:90%
So compared the efficiency.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
On 7%, you produce
more than half,

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and the remaining 93% barely
produces another half.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is interesting, because
if you look at biodynamic

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
gardening and Rudolf Steiner's
anthroposophical methods

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
of gardening, you're talking
about really high yields

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:84%
in small spaces because it's
done with such integrity.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And it has always
been the case.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.300 align:middle line:84%
My research has shown that
even 100 years ago, researchers

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
already attempts to
the people's gardens

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
were four times more productive
than agricultural fields.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.614 align:middle line:84%
And there is an
explanation to it.

00:26:45.614 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:84%
When you have a smaller sized
garden that you can attend--

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
so every day that you can
take better care than you can

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of a huge field,
it's just natural

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:84%
that the productivity
of these gardens

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
will be much, much
greater than that

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of a large commercial
industrial operations.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And also think about
the other dimension.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:84%
When you dig your own garden
with a spade and simple hand

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
tools, you don't require
imports of petroleum

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:90%
to support your food growing.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not dependent
on government subsidies

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:90%
to grow your own food.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not dependent on the
cheap hired agricultural labor.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
You're not dependent on--

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Hopefully chemicals.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Chemicals, because it can
be grown organically very

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:90%
successfully.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not destroying
local communities, which

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.610 align:middle line:84%
has been a huge problem
with American agriculture,

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
is that when large
corporations come,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
local or rural
communities collapse.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you preserve
the tradition.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
An economist with very
deep understanding

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of the meaning of agriculture,
EF Schumacher, author

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
of the famous "Small
is Beautiful,"

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:84%
he was saying that agriculture
has three purposes.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The first purpose is to
reconnect man to nature

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
through every day activity
of gardening or agriculture.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The second one is to make
a piece of land beautiful.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And only the third one
is provide for our needs.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And he says that if you
take care of the first two--

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
reconnecting
yourself with nature

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and making land beautiful--
then the third one

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.680 align:middle line:90%
will be just the byproduct.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:90%
It will be added all by itself.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And Russian gardeners
demonstrate that, in fact,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
if you try to make your garden
as beautiful and as productive

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and spend a lot of time
there, there are never

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
problems with productivity.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And in Russia, you have very
short growing seasons compared

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to what most of the
United States has.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.262 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is the
most amazing part.

00:28:43.262 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
You would think that if this
garden was so productive there

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
in a very good climate
and very fertile soil.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Just the opposite.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's 110 days of
growing season per year

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:84%
on most of Russian territory
from mid-May to mid-September.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
only time you have

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.925 align:middle line:84%
to grow food supply for the
whole year and then to can

00:29:02.925 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:90%
and preserve it for the winter.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Then in terms of soils,
all these gardens

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
during the Soviet
period were allocated

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
on the most marginal
lands that could not be

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:90%
used in state run agriculture.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that the dacha?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.134 align:middle line:84%
>> That is dacha gardens,
as they are called.

00:29:19.134 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So we are talking about
this huge productivity

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
on unproductive poor soils
in very harsh climate.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Also there is a great difference
in mentality and attitudes.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Russian adults who have
a garden on the average

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:84%
spend 18 hours per week
gardening, digging the soil.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Compare this to 32 hours that
an average American spends

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:90%
watching television each week.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, just if in this
country people started

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
devoting one-third of their time
that they spend on watching TV

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
to growing their own food,
they could provide for most

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.510 align:middle line:90%
of their food needs themselves.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really amazing.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.979 align:middle line:84%
But it really comes back
to the word culture.

00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And which is interesting--
the root of the word culture

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:90%
is interesting.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.958 align:middle line:90%
If you'll explain that.

00:30:10.958 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But also that culture is
still very deep in the heart

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:90%
of Russian society.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I would argue it is in
the heart of everybody,

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.250 align:middle line:90%
because the word cult--

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:90%
do not to be afraid of the word.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
In latent language, it literally
means, take care of the soil.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:84%
This is why the word
cultivation is there.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So originally the
word agriculture,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and culture as well,
were understood

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:90%
as taking care of the soil.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not by
accident that this word

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:90%
has a deeper religious meaning.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It is that our ancestors
understood exactly

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
that the best way to
demonstrate your spirituality

00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and the closest link to the
spirit, the Creator, God

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
or whatever other
name you may find

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
for this or life force
that permeates everything,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:84%
is to communicate and take
care of all these living things

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:90%
that surround you.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And it is only later that
instead of cultivation

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of the soil, the
word cult started

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to be understood as some
kind of religious ritual

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:84%
that can be far, far removed
from the reality of a living

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Mother Earth.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is only later that
the word culture started

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to be understood not as
taking care of the soil,

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
but as taking care of our mind
or elevating and nourishing

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:90%
our minds rather than the soil.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So now even in the
language we use today,

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:84%
there are still the remnants
of this very ancient tradition

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that was common not only
to Americans and Russians.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It was probably all over
the world, understanding

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:84%
of the sacredness of this link
and the absolute necessity

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.190 align:middle line:84%
to maintain this link for
the health not only of us,

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:84%
but also the
environment around us.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And so now we're looking at
future generations because it

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:90%
becomes clear to me--

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I interview a lot of
people, as you know,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and I know a lot of
different theories

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about
new technologies

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and future technologies
and so forth.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's becoming
painfully clear

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.299 align:middle line:84%
that until we reconnect with the
land and our natural essence,

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:84%
the rest isn't really going
to make a lot of difference

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.290 align:middle line:84%
in the long run for what we
pass down from generation

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:90%
to generation.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.154 align:middle line:90%
>> And you are right.

00:32:30.154 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:84%
This intergenerational
principle is so important.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason why
land is being abused today

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
is that people seriously think
that their life is limited

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:90%
to the life of their bodies.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.620 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
Russian tradition,

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
which survives in many respects
unchanged to the present day,

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:84%
life was understood as
the life of your family.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And your existence
was understood

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.950 align:middle line:84%
as just one link in a very long
chain of all your ancestors.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:90%
It's called the ken.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:90%
In Russian, it is rod.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:84%
R-O-D. So it's the long chain
of all your ancestors to date,

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:84%
yourself, and all your
descendants in the future.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is what was
understood as the link of life.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.600 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, our
ancestors had no fear of death

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and they would never
sacrifice the integrity

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:25.195 align:middle line:84%
of the natural
ecosystem around them

00:33:25.195 --> 00:33:27.800 align:middle line:84%
for satisfying their
present day needs

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:84%
at the sake of their
future descendants

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
because they were seeing them
as a part of their own life.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So there was not
this distinction

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that I only live today and
I only have 50 or 80 years

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage of
what life has to offer

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and then I will
be gone for good.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it is very important
to transcend this world view

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:84%
if we want to change our
attitudes towards the way we

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:90%
treat our Earth.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And you've raised--
you have children.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And you've raised
them on the land.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And you told a little
story that I thought

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:90%
was so fascinating yesterday.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very sweet, because
you're raising them

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of these principles
that you understand,

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:84%
which in Anastasia's words, a
very different way of rearing

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.199 align:middle line:84%
children than what
we do in the West--

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:90%
much more innate wisdom in it.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:18.970 align:middle line:90%
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me-- you shared a story
about a United States Post

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Office sponsored hunger drive.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell that story?

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a fun story.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:33.199 align:middle line:84%
About a year ago,
US postal office

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
organized an
anti-hunger food drive.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And I received in my mailbox,
and probably many more people

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:84%
did throughout the country,
a postcard inviting everybody

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to go to the supermarket to
purchase some canned food

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and put it into your mailbox.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:84%
The mail carrier would
collect them the next day

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and take it to the
local food bank

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to be distributed to
the hungry to feed them.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I took out this post card
and it was bright and beautiful

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
with smiling people and
some canned food on it.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.629 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter
asked me, daddy--

00:35:11.629 --> 00:35:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>> She's five years old, right?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> She was five years
old at that time.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, what is this?

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, they want
to feed the hungry people

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:84%
so that there are
no hungry people.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, what a
wonderful idea, is it not?

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.785 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, it is.

00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And she said, so
what do they suggest?

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I explained to her
that they suggest

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that you go and purchase some
food and put it in the mailbox

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and it will be
delivered to the poor.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.945 align:middle line:84%
And now this child who grew
up with exposure to gardening

00:35:38.945 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and who has a very good
understanding where

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
food is actually coming
from thought for 30 seconds

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
without any interference
on my part--

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I was not trying to introduce
any judgment for my own--

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.450 align:middle line:84%
she herself after 30
minutes came up with--

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>> 30 seconds.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> 30 seconds-- came
up with the question,

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:84%
but what will happen after they
eat all the food that you put

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:90%
into your mailbox?

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.760 align:middle line:90%
They will be hungry again.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And she thought
a little bit more

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and said, but in
the first place,

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.570 align:middle line:90%
why are there hungry people?

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Don't they know that they
can take a small seed,

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.532 align:middle line:84%
put it in the ground and
it will grow food for you?

00:36:19.532 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, for a small child,
it was incomprehensible

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:84%
that people would try to
solve the problem of hunger

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:84%
not by educating people
how to grow their own food,

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
but trying to provide them with
some supplies that will only

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.430 align:middle line:84%
be sufficient to provide for
several days of their food

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.480 align:middle line:90%
needs.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And then she told
me, you know, daddy,

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:84%
when you go to this
conference, I really

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:84%
think that you need to tell the
audience that they should not

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:84%
be putting the canned
food in their mailboxes

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:84%
because next time they will have
to put medicine so that people

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.985 align:middle line:84%
can heal the diseases that they
get from eating this canned

00:36:58.985 --> 00:36:59.785 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:36:59.785 --> 00:37:00.585 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is a child
of five years.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:84%
From the mouths of
babes, but she already

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:90%
has that innate wisdom.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is because
you have the innate wisdom.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
You and your wife have
imbued this to your children.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And you really-- gardening
and having their hands

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.094 align:middle line:84%
in the soil with
seeds and flowers

00:37:19.094 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:84%
is a big part of the
transferring of this knowledge.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to
much higher abilities

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our openness
of mind and ability

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to receive knowledge
across the board--

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:84%
not just agrarian knowledge,
but knowledge across the board.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:90%
In the Anastasia series--

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And Anastasia explains
it in very simple terms.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:84%
She says, all the
objects in our world

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:84%
can be regarded in
a very direct sense

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.310 align:middle line:90%
as matter realized thought.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.660 align:middle line:90%
So just think about it.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:84%
When a child plays
with a living creature,

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:84%
be it a squirrel or even a pet,
or when the child interacts

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
with a living plant, he
is interacting directly

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:90%
with the thought of the Creator.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And this encourages
the child to really

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
reach out and try to
expand the thought

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and to reach the
level of whoever

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.260 align:middle line:84%
created this natural object
in front of the child.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Compare this with the child
in the civilized world who

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
is mostly surrounded by
artificial toys which

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
are the product of the thought
of some designer who is not

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
nearly as perfect as
the power, the one who

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.660 align:middle line:84%
created the squirrel
or a bird or a pumpkin.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way she explains
just why exposing children

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to natural experiences is
so important for expanding

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:52.860 align:middle line:84%
their understanding or awakening
their innate knowledge of how

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the world works.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it
applies not only

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
to understanding of gardening,
but to all areas of life

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.870 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
My daughter keeps telling her
grandparents over the phone

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.020 align:middle line:84%
how they should live
and how they should not

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:84%
live in the cities because
when they flush their toilet,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:84%
the turds flow into
their river and make fish

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.900 align:middle line:90%
unhappy over the dirty water.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> She's already an ecologist.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.600 align:middle line:84%
She understands complex
systems for a little girl.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, we
could talk for days.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But what I would rather do is
suggest that people go online

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and pick up a copy, the
whole series of these books,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:90%
because it's a magical read.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdoms that
are contained within I

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.420 align:middle line:84%
think are absolutely
essential in helping us

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.670 align:middle line:90%
shape our future as a species.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough
praise for this.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
experience of the publisher

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.419 align:middle line:84%
was that 60% of people who
read the book one, "Anastasia,"

00:39:51.419 --> 00:39:53.460 align:middle line:84%
which is book one of "The
Ringing Cedars" series.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.940 align:middle line:84%
60% of these people carry
on to read the whole series.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So that means that really
the material in these books

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:84%
resonates very, very strongly
with people in this country

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and all over the
English-speaking world.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And also you, for the
next little while anyway,

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
are going to be giving talks
and showing up at conferences

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
around to begin
sharing this knowledge

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:15.860 align:middle line:90%
to get people on this--

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you know, I long about
going back to my homestead

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:84%
in Russia because I have a small
five acre homestead and want

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to be back there
planting the garden,

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.060 align:middle line:84%
but somebody told me here, Leo,
it's wonderful that you are

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
happy planting potatoes, but you
need to be telling other people

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.440 align:middle line:84%
how to be happy
planting potatoes.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And you did a beautiful
job yesterday.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
This has been the highlight
of the conference for me.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for taking a little time,

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.690 align:middle line:84%
because I know you have to
catch a plane very shortly.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Leo.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.049 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.049 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I can't recommend highly enough
that you pick up "The Ringing

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Cedars" series of books.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They address just
about every issue

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.860 align:middle line:84%
known to man-- from love,
childbearing, intuitive

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.470 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, the invisible
power structures that

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:90%
control us, to ETs and more.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.310 align:middle line:90%
They're a wonderful journey.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks
for watching CMN.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:26.507 align:middle line:90%
