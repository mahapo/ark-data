00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.695
<v ->It was a genuine pleasure to sit with Jos√© Arguellas.</v>

2
00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:17.745
He's been working for more than 50 years

3
00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.645
to assist humanity in becoming aware of our destiny

4
00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.295
as a species at this point of change.

5
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.845
He was a driving force behind the creation of Earth Day

6
00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.145
and the harmonic convergence, in which he called

7
00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.795
upon mankind to respect the Earth

8
00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.935
and hold a higher vision of our future.

9
00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:34.635
His greatest work, however, has been

10
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.585
in helping uncover the meaning of the Mayan calendar

11
00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:39.935
at a time when time matters.

12
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.635
He says this system of natural time cycles

13
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.430
was brought to Earth to counter the negative effects

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.330
on human consciousness of the Gregorian calendar.

15
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.875
Jose, it's a pleasure to sit with you.

16
00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.275
I've been following your work for some time

17
00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:03.220
and we're going to get into the real meat of it,

18
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.570
and I thought we might start off,

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.915
just so people get to know a bit

20
00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:08.215
of your heart and soul better,

21
00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:09.660
about an experience that happened

22
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.010
when you were 14 years old that really helped

23
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710
guide the rest of your life.

24
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.960
<v ->Yes, when I was 14,</v>

25
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.455
I was brought up in Mexico for my first five-plus years,

26
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.955
and then, through different circumstances,

27
00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:24.955
I ended up in the United States,

28
00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:28.905
and when I was 14, my father finally had the opportunity

29
00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:31.055
there to go back to the home country

30
00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:33.405
for the first time since we left,

31
00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.003
and he wanted to take my twin brother and myself with him,

32
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.450
which was a delight to me.

33
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.200
As you noted, I was 14, and I had,

34
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.695
for me, Mexico was a very mysterious, mystical part

35
00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:48.745
of my life, my father was Mexican,

36
00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.440
and we were living in a very, very,

37
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.140
very, very white North American community,

38
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.085
and he had a number of books that I could

39
00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.835
study and look at and I got some glimpses

40
00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.635
and ideas of ancient Mexico,

41
00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:02.785
so when we went down on this trip,

42
00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:06.635
I had in myself, there's only one thing I wanted to do,

43
00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.585
I wanted to get to the top of the largest pyramid,

44
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:12.480
Teotihuacan, outside of Mexico City,

45
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.480
it's like burning in me.

46
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.625
And that finally happened, we drove down

47
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.270
from Minnesota all the way down to Mexico City,

48
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.720
a week or 10 days or whatever that was,

49
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.403
and after a few days in Mexico City

50
00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:27.800
with some of my relatives, we finally got

51
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.845
the chance to go to Teotihuacan.

52
00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:33.845
It was a nice summer morning, maybe late July,

53
00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:38.585
it may be exactly 57 years ago today, for all I know,

54
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:42.785
and we got there, and we got out of my uncle's car

55
00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:45.983
and we got into the main part of Teotihuacan,

56
00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:50.533
and I saw the pyramid, and as soon as I saw it,

57
00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:55.533
I went running to it, and I ran up all the way to the top,

58
00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:58.033
it's a very large pyramid, it's like the size

59
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.236
of the Great Pyramid in Egypt,

60
00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:03.083
I stepped pyramid, I got to the top,

61
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:07.263
and when I got to the top, I looked around,

62
00:03:07.263 --> 00:03:10.716
and I could see just how small everybody was,

63
00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:14.063
and I could feel like, I could feel

64
00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:16.508
what it was in my being in that,

65
00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.958
the day before I had been in Mexico City,

66
00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.306
they're all proud that they had

67
00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:22.203
a Sears and Roebuck there now,

68
00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.803
and I was just thinking, I could just feel this contrast

69
00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:28.903
between the Sears and Roebuck in Mexico City

70
00:03:28.903 --> 00:03:30.953
and what this was all about,

71
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:34.053
and then as I sat there, contemplating it all,

72
00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:36.503
it was like I was filled with a white light, literally,

73
00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:39.803
I remember just feeling like everything kind of dissolved

74
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.653
into this white light and it was like I had

75
00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:46.353
this deep presentiment inside of myself,

76
00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:49.953
that it was my life mission to find out

77
00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.238
what the cosmic knowledge was

78
00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:55.828
that was behind these pyramids

79
00:03:55.828 --> 00:03:58.428
and what that cosmic knowledge was,

80
00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:01.528
and bring that back to the modern world,

81
00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:06.078
because I felt it might be useful to modern humans.

82
00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:09.718
<v Regina>57 years later, as you say,</v>

83
00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:12.418
now we're approaching a really interesting time in history

84
00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:16.218
for all of humanity, for all lifeforms on planet Earth,

85
00:04:16.218 --> 00:04:19.863
and this possibility of our going through

86
00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:21.913
a conscious type of evolution,

87
00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:25.153
and along the way, one of the stories that

88
00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:29.003
is closely aligned with you is that of time,

89
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:32.803
and I think everyone relates to the subject of time

90
00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:35.853
right now, because we feel as though we're being pushed

91
00:04:35.853 --> 00:04:39.098
by it, it seems to consume us, it creates great deals

92
00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:41.998
of stress and strife in our lives

93
00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:45.451
that we're not even aware of, it's really subconscious,

94
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.798
and I would love it if you would just tell us

95
00:04:47.798 --> 00:04:50.448
how you began to understand time,

96
00:04:50.448 --> 00:04:52.848
and go through some of the historical perspectives

97
00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:54.193
of the development of modern...

98
00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.693
<v ->Yes, well, it was my good fortune,</v>

99
00:04:56.693 --> 00:04:59.193
after this experience on the pyramid,

100
00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:02.193
to return to my home town in Minnesota,

101
00:05:02.193 --> 00:05:04.841
and within two or three months,

102
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.788
I was working at the public library, shelving books,

103
00:05:08.788 --> 00:05:11.088
and it was my good fortune, a few months later,

104
00:05:11.088 --> 00:05:15.038
to come across a book by Sylvanus Morley

105
00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:18.533
called The Ancient Maya, this is, at that time,

106
00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.783
one of the top books about the Maya,

107
00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:25.333
archeological, of course, but very, kind of,

108
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.933
for that time, when it was published, 1947,

109
00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:32.683
this was 1954, as complete information as you could find

110
00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:35.333
on the Maya, and I opened that book

111
00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.228
and he had a chapter and everything,

112
00:05:37.228 --> 00:05:41.128
I opened the chapter on Mayan mathematics and astronomy,

113
00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:43.378
and I said, shoo, that was it,

114
00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:45.878
I knew that was what I was supposed to look at.

115
00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.928
It explained that the Mayan system,

116
00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:52.128
mathematical system, astronomical system,

117
00:05:52.128 --> 00:05:54.128
and calendrical system was,

118
00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:57.176
A, radically different from anything we knew in the West,

119
00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:59.726
or actually, anywhere else in the world,

120
00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.321
because the Mayan system is based

121
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:04.821
on what's called a 20-count, instead of a 10-count,

122
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:07.266
it's not decimal, but duodecimal,

123
00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.516
they also had a positional zero,

124
00:06:09.516 --> 00:06:11.056
just like the decimal system,

125
00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:12.606
so they were able to make

126
00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:16.556
fantastically huge computations,

127
00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:18.751
they could compute anything,

128
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:20.701
it's a very, very different system.

129
00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:22.951
It was written in very simple method

130
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:25.041
of dot-bar notation, one dot is one,

131
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.491
two dots is two, four dots is four, a bar is five,

132
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.686
and you get up to 19, and you have

133
00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:32.886
a dot and a zero, and that's 20.

134
00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:36.136
And so I learned that system, I loved it,

135
00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:39.236
and I would do mathematical computations with it,

136
00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:41.461
it was more fun than physics.

137
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:43.251
<v Regina>And you were what, 15, 16?</v>

138
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:46.251
<v ->14, yeah, so, from there,</v>

139
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:48.151
I knew I developed this passion,

140
00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:49.801
that I wanted to learn more about it,

141
00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:53.186
there wasn't much to learn, to study or learn from

142
00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:54.966
back in those days,

143
00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:59.086
but this interest in the Mayan calendar

144
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:02.866
then led me to a point in 1969

145
00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:05.916
where I met a man named Tony Scher

146
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:08.116
who showed me the sacred calendar,

147
00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:10.411
the 260-day, which is the basis of it,

148
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:14.061
and then during the 1970s, I made a big version

149
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.659
of the sacred calendar in dot-bar notation,

150
00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.246
this is a 13 series,

151
00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:22.239
a 20 series of akanda, of 13,

152
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:24.189
which creates this matrix, and it was, like,

153
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.042
unlike anything I had ever seen.

154
00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:29.492
I studied, I meditated, and so and so, through the--

155
00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:32.745
and what I was interested in was the mathematics

156
00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:35.395
behind this, this is the basis of the calendar,

157
00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:37.595
this was the basis of their astronomy,

158
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:40.745
it was a highly harmonic mathematical system,

159
00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:43.145
so through the 80s, I studied that,

160
00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:44.998
and in my book, The Mayan Factor,

161
00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:48.148
I sent this guy some of my knowledge about that,

162
00:07:48.148 --> 00:07:51.298
and after The Mayan Factor was published, in 1989,

163
00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:53.798
that was three years after it was published,

164
00:07:53.798 --> 00:07:57.504
I already started experimenting living on some

165
00:07:57.504 --> 00:08:00.054
of these cycles, working out the mathematics

166
00:08:00.054 --> 00:08:01.660
of what these cycles were,

167
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.510
and in 1989, on December 10th,

168
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.860
I had the great good fortune of being

169
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.366
in the Clock Museum in Geneva, Switzerland,

170
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:16.066
as it's popularly known as the Museum of Time there,

171
00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:18.816
since I was really interested in time by this point,

172
00:08:18.816 --> 00:08:22.066
and I had seen what the Mayan system was,

173
00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:24.369
I'd seen the Gregorian system a little bit

174
00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:27.269
with the leap day, and I saw how

175
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:29.780
if you had a leap day in a particular Mayan system,

176
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.230
it threw the system off, and so I was in the Clock Museum,

177
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.929
and I realized, after two hours,

178
00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.230
that the whole of modern civilization

179
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.683
is based on a frequency,

180
00:08:43.683 --> 00:08:46.086
12, to mark the 12 hours

181
00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:48.336
that you have on the face of any clock,

182
00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:50.636
and that you find anywhere, 60 minutes,

183
00:08:50.636 --> 00:08:53.286
and also 12 months Gregorian calendar.

184
00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:56.436
I knew, in a flash, I said,

185
00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:59.436
"This is the reason why modern civilization

186
00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:02.036
"is going to fall off the edge of the cliff."

187
00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:04.186
<v Regina>That, now, for most people, they'd say,</v>

188
00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:06.483
"Huh, how did you get that out

189
00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:08.186
"of the visit to the Clock Museum?"

190
00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:10.648
But what was it you were experiencing in that?

191
00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:12.148
<v ->What I was experiencing was</v>

192
00:09:12.148 --> 00:09:16.198
how artificial, mechanistic this time was compared--

193
00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:18.648
see, if I hadn't studied the Mayan mathematics

194
00:09:18.648 --> 00:09:21.898
and Mayan calendar, I would have never had this ah-ha.

195
00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:24.998
And that's what gave me the ah-ha, I had,

196
00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:28.151
what the sorcerers say, is study a separate reality

197
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.451
and look at this reality and see what it is.

198
00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:34.401
So I was able to see what it was, I said,

199
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:38.001
this Mayan time is cosmic, it's universal,

200
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:42.204
it's endless cycles, it puts you in the rhythms of nature,

201
00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:46.704
and this other time, that's in the clock museum,

202
00:09:46.704 --> 00:09:50.004
is all based on artificial time, you know,

203
00:09:50.004 --> 00:09:51.860
and people never stop to think about, when you look

204
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.310
at a clock, it's a measurement of space,

205
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.560
it's just watching these little hands go around a circle

206
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.410
in space, okay, that's all it does, all day long,

207
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.360
and it moves, every 60 minutes it moves

208
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.410
one-twelfth of that circle, and that's time,

209
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.360
people think that's what time is,

210
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.116
that's not time,

211
00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:16.566
that's just this mechanistic thing

212
00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:19.516
going on with the little circle in space,

213
00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:21.916
and we base our whole life on it.

214
00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:23.566
<v Regina>Well, and that perception,</v>

215
00:10:23.566 --> 00:10:26.616
that that's what time is, regulates the way

216
00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:28.816
we interface with our own lives and consciousness

217
00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:30.869
and each other, it rules.

218
00:10:30.869 --> 00:10:32.872
<v ->See, we don't understand the degree to which,</v>

219
00:10:32.872 --> 00:10:35.172
when we look at ourselves existentially,

220
00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:38.972
we orient ourselves by space, where am I,

221
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:42.425
where is the sun rising, where does the sun set,

222
00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:47.025
where is the Big Dipper, what phase is the moon in,

223
00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:50.375
you know, it's like that, that's how we orient ourselves.

224
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:53.231
The other way we orient ourselves is by time.

225
00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:55.431
Time is really subjective.

226
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:59.181
It's so hard for us to think of time,

227
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:02.231
it's very hard for anyone in Western civilization

228
00:11:02.231 --> 00:11:05.190
to think of time existing

229
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.690
without April, June, and November.

230
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.256
Okay, it's hard to say--

231
00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:14.703
you know, for, like, for that tree there,

232
00:11:14.703 --> 00:11:17.159
it doesn't matter what it is,

233
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:19.309
it's just living in the eternal now,

234
00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:23.109
but we're in this cycle that takes us every year,

235
00:11:23.109 --> 00:11:26.559
from January 1st, we wake up and we've got

236
00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:29.215
a hangover and depression, all the way

237
00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:33.418
to December 31st, so we binged and we got

238
00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:36.218
too many materials, presents, and everything else,

239
00:11:36.218 --> 00:11:39.368
and repeats it, and that's the macro program.

240
00:11:39.368 --> 00:11:42.268
The micro program is that clock.

241
00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.721
I saw that the humans--

242
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:46.774
I just saw in a flash how the human,

243
00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:49.524
the global civilization based on this clock,

244
00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:52.777
which has everybody speeding, speeding up

245
00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:55.183
and speeding up and at the same time

246
00:11:55.183 --> 00:11:58.739
distracted timing program as the Gregorian calendar,

247
00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:02.039
and I saw that that, because neither of those is based--

248
00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:03.937
it doesn't, it takes you out of touch

249
00:12:03.937 --> 00:12:05.537
with your natural rhythms.

250
00:12:05.537 --> 00:12:06.937
The clock is not based

251
00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:09.687
on any natural rhythm, it's a machine.

252
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:12.590
It's a mechanization of our time sense,

253
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.890
so this whole subjective sensibility becomes mechanized,

254
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.343
it gets divorced from nature, so when you get

255
00:12:20.343 --> 00:12:21.746
divorced from nature, you know,

256
00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:24.061
"Nature doesn't have any soul, we'll do what we need to.

257
00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:26.099
"We'll take what we want, okay?"

258
00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:33.773
We move, we put it all into create a consumer society,

259
00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:36.423
we transform the commodity,

260
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.923
the raw grids in the commodities and so it's all for money.

261
00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:43.176
Time is money, is the whole philosophy,

262
00:12:43.176 --> 00:12:45.976
and that came up at the beginning of the industrial age

263
00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:48.676
in the 18th century, so that's the--

264
00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:51.282
our prevailing concept of time is the clock,

265
00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:52.932
and time is money.

266
00:12:52.932 --> 00:12:54.088
<v Regina>So I have a few different--</v>

267
00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:55.388
I'm sorry, go ahead.

268
00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:57.394
It's leading me to a few different lines

269
00:12:57.394 --> 00:12:59.294
of questioning, one of them is,

270
00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:01.544
when you think about time, it's noticed

271
00:13:01.544 --> 00:13:04.194
that often, in the southern hemisphere,

272
00:13:04.194 --> 00:13:06.674
in a lot of countries, there doesn't seem

273
00:13:06.674 --> 00:13:10.094
to be the same connection to mechanistic time

274
00:13:10.094 --> 00:13:12.374
that there is in the northern hemisphere, when you

275
00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:15.611
get into the European and Northern American cultures.

276
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:18.794
Is that something that might be more indigenous,

277
00:13:18.794 --> 00:13:21.194
that lingers and is still speaking to people?

278
00:13:21.194 --> 00:13:22.977
<v ->You know, I don't know how true that is,</v>

279
00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:25.137
because I've spent a lot of time in the southern hemisphere.

280
00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.057
<v Regina>Well, you know more than I,</v>

281
00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.157
are they running on time these days?

282
00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:31.503
<v ->The fact is, you know, Brazil is getting heavy,</v>

283
00:13:31.503 --> 00:13:32.886
it's running on time.

284
00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:34.263
<v Regina>Didn't used to.</v>

285
00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:35.698
<v ->Yeah, but they are.</v>

286
00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:38.698
So, that's the colonialist legacy everywhere in the world,

287
00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:41.758
there's nowhere in the world that isn't like that,

288
00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:45.118
we are, so what I'm saying is that this artificial--

289
00:13:45.118 --> 00:13:47.518
we're living by artificial time, it separates us

290
00:13:47.518 --> 00:13:50.758
from nature, it separates us from our own souls,

291
00:13:50.758 --> 00:13:54.881
it makes us more and more alienated from ourselves,

292
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:57.221
it makes us more and more alienated from nature,

293
00:13:57.221 --> 00:13:59.587
the more alienated from nature we become,

294
00:13:59.587 --> 00:14:02.647
the easier it is for us to just deplete the resources

295
00:14:02.647 --> 00:14:04.850
and use them for our own goods to make money

296
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.816
or to spend our money on, and so,

297
00:14:07.816 --> 00:14:10.739
and I saw, I could see, let's just, that's just

298
00:14:10.739 --> 00:14:14.279
a truck without brakes heading for a brick wall.

299
00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:17.579
That's because, the machine is going,

300
00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:19.859
and then the faster the machine goes,

301
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.662
the faster we go, one thing, you know, to have

302
00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:25.105
railroad trains, it's another thing to have an automobile,

303
00:14:25.105 --> 00:14:27.145
it's another thing to have an airplane,

304
00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:30.082
but to have a computer, that's going very fast,

305
00:14:30.082 --> 00:14:33.085
and the thing is, every single one of these

306
00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:35.365
is an untested technology.

307
00:14:35.365 --> 00:14:39.291
<v Regina>Untested in sense of its humanity?</v>

308
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:43.217
<v ->Let's see, how will this impact society?</v>

309
00:14:43.217 --> 00:14:45.403
How will it impact our psyche,

310
00:14:45.403 --> 00:14:47.080
how will it impact how we live?

311
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.983
No, they just, as soon as you invent it, you run for it.

312
00:14:50.983 --> 00:14:53.186
<v Regina>Yeah, no, that's very true.</v>

313
00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:55.766
We're very conditioned to that.

314
00:14:55.766 --> 00:14:59.966
<v ->So we're living this great, great,</v>

315
00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:04.929
great untested experiment of technology,

316
00:15:04.929 --> 00:15:09.139
and it's actually driving us crazy and killing us.

317
00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:11.659
<v Regina>It is, and when you stop to think about it,</v>

318
00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:13.502
one of the things that intrigues me is,

319
00:15:13.502 --> 00:15:16.682
you look at the cycles of nature, that's very obvious

320
00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:19.262
if you live in an area with seasons, but even just--

321
00:15:19.262 --> 00:15:21.782
it seems like time should be more oriented

322
00:15:21.782 --> 00:15:23.788
toward the natural cycles of nature,

323
00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:26.608
but also the cycles of our own internal functioning.

324
00:15:26.608 --> 00:15:29.365
I mean, even digestion has its own genuine cycle,

325
00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:32.931
and we don't operate even within the simplest

326
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:36.954
structure of our own body's needs, our own brain's needs.

327
00:15:36.954 --> 00:15:38.814
<v ->Exactly, no, we don't, we just,</v>

328
00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:41.814
we cram everything, it's a 9-to-5 world,

329
00:15:41.814 --> 00:15:44.180
it's a five-day week,

330
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.466
and now it's a 24-7 life.

331
00:15:48.466 --> 00:15:51.406
<v Regina>And you mentioned, I heard you talk earlier,</v>

332
00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:54.406
and you were talking about our own telepathic abilities

333
00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:56.832
are even squelched by this,

334
00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:59.292
by being tethered to time.

335
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.572
Talk more about that, please.

336
00:16:01.572 --> 00:16:03.432
<v ->Well, you know,</v>

337
00:16:03.432 --> 00:16:05.952
if you allow yourself to go out

338
00:16:05.952 --> 00:16:09.012
and live in the wilderness for two weeks,

339
00:16:09.012 --> 00:16:12.672
or four weeks, just in the wilderness,

340
00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:14.661
with one cycle of the moon,

341
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:17.901
say, as your gauge,

342
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:21.561
you will find, and no clock, no watch,

343
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:25.210
nothing like that, no computer, no cell phone,

344
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.830
you will find that you are getting in touch

345
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.510
with aspects of your being that you hardly knew existed,

346
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.779
and you will also find that just to orient yourself

347
00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:41.176
and be where you are, you have to become

348
00:16:41.176 --> 00:16:44.599
much more telepathically perceptive.

349
00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:49.862
When we, like I said, our time sense is very subjective,

350
00:16:49.862 --> 00:16:52.742
it's very much related to our capacity for telepathy,

351
00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:57.251
when we are continuously texting, or looking at a clock,

352
00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:01.297
or being run by the clock, we don't think,

353
00:17:01.297 --> 00:17:05.837
we're just mechanical automatons or robots,

354
00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:08.660
we're just moving very quickly.

355
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.377
You know, the closer it gets to 9 o'clock

356
00:17:12.377 --> 00:17:15.080
and the people are coming off the buses and subways

357
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.300
as fast as they run to get to work.

358
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.863
That's because they're ruled by the clock,

359
00:17:19.863 --> 00:17:22.683
if they're late for work, time is money, they lose money.

360
00:17:22.683 --> 00:17:24.046
<v Regina>Or their job.</v>

361
00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:25.606
<v ->Or their job, yeah.</v>

362
00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:29.446
So that's the whole picture, and so that's--

363
00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:31.606
I mean, we all, you know,

364
00:17:31.606 --> 00:17:33.989
we have never stopped to think about that,

365
00:17:33.989 --> 00:17:36.989
because that's life, okay, that's how we grew up,

366
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.929
and as I say, no one ever questioned it,

367
00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:43.409
but what we're saying is, like,

368
00:17:43.409 --> 00:17:46.032
I was able to take this view from the outside, saying,

369
00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:50.807
no, it's, you're blowing it, you know,

370
00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:55.787
the actual nature of time is synchronicity,

371
00:17:55.787 --> 00:17:58.907
okay, that's the nature of time.

372
00:17:58.907 --> 00:18:02.784
Everything in the universe is synchronized with itself.

373
00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:06.854
The moon is synchronized going around the Earth,

374
00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:09.194
the Earth is synchronized going around the sun,

375
00:18:09.194 --> 00:18:11.774
the sun is synchronized in its constellation,

376
00:18:11.774 --> 00:18:15.394
with the galaxy, and going around the galaxy,

377
00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:18.128
the whole galaxy cluster is synchronized,

378
00:18:18.128 --> 00:18:21.848
and so on and so forth, so everything is synchronized.

379
00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:23.875
The birds wake up in the morning

380
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:26.278
when the first rays of the sun come up,

381
00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:29.635
and they stop their tweet-tweet-tweeting

382
00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:32.745
when the sun goes down, and it's all,

383
00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:36.335
everything is a big synchronistic symphony,

384
00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:40.172
from the point of view of the Earth, the Earth is a whole--

385
00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:42.692
if you get out in space and look at the Earth,

386
00:18:42.692 --> 00:18:45.692
you know, sure, one side is dark and one side is light,

387
00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:48.572
but it's always turning, but the Earth as a whole thing

388
00:18:50.142 --> 00:18:54.157
is one same moment in time, all the time.

389
00:18:54.157 --> 00:18:57.577
Okay, it's one same moment in time, all the time.

390
00:18:57.577 --> 00:19:00.340
Everything, from the Earth's point of view,

391
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.917
everything is in a state of synchronicity.

392
00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:05.077
Well, we live in an artificial bubble,

393
00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:07.957
and so we can't recognize that.

394
00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:12.157
Jung came up with the concept of synchronicity in 1952,

395
00:19:12.157 --> 00:19:14.917
and I'm starting to scratch the surface

396
00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:18.171
of the edges we're wearing out, you know,

397
00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:20.691
the synchronicity and then we've got

398
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:23.031
things like LSD and stuff like that,

399
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:25.939
that pops a couple more little holes in the veil there,

400
00:19:25.939 --> 00:19:28.279
you know, and then you get, by the time you get

401
00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:30.239
to the 1980s and someone like the Police

402
00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:32.013
put out an album called Synchronicity,

403
00:19:32.013 --> 00:19:34.056
and nowadays, people are saying,

404
00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:36.133
synchronistic experience is becoming more,

405
00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:40.516
quote unquote, normal, okay, because the fabric

406
00:19:40.516 --> 00:19:43.453
of artificial time is wearing out,

407
00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:46.153
and people are looking for ways out,

408
00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:48.793
and when people have synchronistic experiences,

409
00:19:48.793 --> 00:19:51.783
that's telling them, oh, wait, there's another reality,

410
00:19:51.783 --> 00:19:55.213
this isn't the only reality here,

411
00:19:55.213 --> 00:19:57.976
but generally speaking, synchronicity

412
00:19:57.976 --> 00:20:02.075
is very, very kind of abnormal experience,

413
00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:03.938
it's not the every day experience.

414
00:20:03.938 --> 00:20:05.615
<v Regina>It should be our every day,</v>

415
00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:06.729
every moment experience.

416
00:20:06.729 --> 00:20:07.865
<v ->It should be,</v>

417
00:20:07.865 --> 00:20:09.545
so the only way you can get out of it

418
00:20:09.545 --> 00:20:11.888
is to stop the clock.

419
00:20:11.888 --> 00:20:13.462
<v Regina>And to let the systems--</v>

420
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.269
once the systems begin to disintegrate,

421
00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:17.664
that we've artificially constructed,

422
00:20:17.664 --> 00:20:20.417
then we can go back into living a truer kind of life.

423
00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:23.124
Take us back into Sumerian times, this whole thing

424
00:20:23.124 --> 00:20:25.461
about time and the Gregorian calendar,

425
00:20:25.461 --> 00:20:27.801
and some of the mathematics behind

426
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:30.713
this artificiality of time that we're living under,

427
00:20:30.713 --> 00:20:33.053
I didn't understand that part of history.

428
00:20:33.053 --> 00:20:36.433
<v ->Well, the Babylonians knew, from the very beginning,</v>

429
00:20:36.433 --> 00:20:40.073
the Sumerians knew that if you take a sphere

430
00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.193
and you divide it 360 degrees,

431
00:20:43.193 --> 00:20:44.794
and you divide that

432
00:20:44.794 --> 00:20:48.912
into 24 parts of 15 degrees each arc,

433
00:20:48.912 --> 00:20:53.662
and then each of those 15 degrees, then you subdivide that

434
00:20:53.662 --> 00:20:56.755
into 60 minutes, and then each of those 60 minutes,

435
00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.679
they'd divide into 60 seconds.

436
00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:01.203
For some weird reason or another,

437
00:21:01.203 --> 00:21:03.189
the Sumerians knew all that.

438
00:21:03.189 --> 00:21:07.086
That's a division of space, see,

439
00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:10.206
that's the whole thing, that's the basis of the clock,

440
00:21:10.206 --> 00:21:14.678
the basis of time, 24 hours on the clock,

441
00:21:14.678 --> 00:21:16.966
through 12 parts of 12,

442
00:21:16.966 --> 00:21:19.410
12 is part of what you call a hexadecimal,

443
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.414
a base on six, mathematical systems,

444
00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:25.326
six, 12, 60, 36,

445
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:29.382
which is a perfectly good measure of space,

446
00:21:29.382 --> 00:21:32.086
but it's used to be a measure of time,

447
00:21:32.086 --> 00:21:36.142
and when you use a measure of space to be a measure of time,

448
00:21:36.142 --> 00:21:40.458
then that's when it starts messing,

449
00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:43.578
that's not because, then it's not a natural cycle,

450
00:21:43.578 --> 00:21:46.178
it's a perfect measure of space.

451
00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:49.142
It's not a cycle of nature.

452
00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:52.131
<v Regina>Do you think this was simply accidental,</v>

453
00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:55.043
or unintentional in nature?

454
00:21:55.043 --> 00:21:59.567
<v ->I think that there is some kind of intentionality to it,</v>

455
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:03.730
that came from, not necessarily from this planet.

456
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.095
<v Regina>Yes, I get that part, I understand what</v>

457
00:22:06.095 --> 00:22:08.123
you're saying, that's why I wanted you to talk about it.

458
00:22:08.123 --> 00:22:11.813
So this may have been injected into the thinking,

459
00:22:11.813 --> 00:22:15.322
specifically at that time, to create a kind of disharmony,

460
00:22:15.322 --> 00:22:17.299
to begin the process of disconnecting us

461
00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:18.856
from ourselves and nature.

462
00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:21.820
<v ->In my understanding, this is precisely, then,</v>

463
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.277
why the Mayans incarnated on the other side

464
00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:29.606
of the planet to establish the fundamentals

465
00:22:29.606 --> 00:22:31.995
of what I call the Mayan time science,

466
00:22:31.995 --> 00:22:35.895
and Mayan time signs is the cosmic universal time science.

467
00:22:35.895 --> 00:22:37.715
<v Regina>Now, this might be a little--</v>

468
00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:39.639
I don't know if it's something you care to answer,

469
00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:41.875
or you've given great amount of consideration to,

470
00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:44.631
there's some understanding also that the Mayans may

471
00:22:44.631 --> 00:22:47.699
have been an off-planet culture source to begin with, right?

472
00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:51.412
So are you talking about perhaps, at that time,

473
00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:55.218
an incarnation of a group of beings

474
00:22:55.218 --> 00:22:56.741
that was trying to counter them,

475
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:58.717
what had happened in the Sumerian times?

476
00:22:58.717 --> 00:23:01.602
<v ->Yes, that's exactly what I'm trying to hint at.</v>

477
00:23:01.602 --> 00:23:03.994
<v Regina>Yes, I thought we might just say it.</v>

478
00:23:03.994 --> 00:23:08.341
<v ->Yeah, that's really, that's very much the case,</v>

479
00:23:08.341 --> 00:23:12.914
that they saw, let's put it this way,

480
00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:17.802
that the galactic Mayan surveillance team, let's say,

481
00:23:17.802 --> 00:23:20.843
watching this part of the, what I call,

482
00:23:20.843 --> 00:23:23.287
the experimental zone of the universe,

483
00:23:23.287 --> 00:23:26.670
the solar system here, that they were watching this,

484
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.619
they saw that, what we might call, a karmic stream

485
00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:35.458
from a previous world system that wanted

486
00:23:35.458 --> 00:23:39.303
to capture, let's say,

487
00:23:39.303 --> 00:23:42.163
a particular planet injected this

488
00:23:42.163 --> 00:23:45.702
Babylonian-Sumerian idea of time

489
00:23:45.702 --> 00:23:48.403
being based on the 12 and the 60,

490
00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:51.860
and that happened, and it's interesting

491
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.564
that the Sumerians knew that exactly

492
00:23:54.564 --> 00:23:57.320
at what we call the beginning of the Mayan great cycle,

493
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.896
in 3100, so that's exactly when that occurred,

494
00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:04.600
you have evidence of that existing at that time.

495
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.730
So the Mayans then came in at the right time

496
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.219
and said, okay, well we have to,

497
00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:15.131
we see where that's at, we see where that's going to go,

498
00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:16.597
and that's going to create disaster,

499
00:24:16.597 --> 00:24:18.123
the only thing we can do is come down here

500
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:22.026
and plant seeds of the correct timing sensibility,

501
00:24:22.026 --> 00:24:24.259
the correct mathematics of time,

502
00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:28.107
and pray that, like,

503
00:24:28.107 --> 00:24:31.081
at the right moment, that all this gets discovered

504
00:24:31.081 --> 00:24:33.150
and that we realize what it is,

505
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.126
and inject the data in there,

506
00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:37.622
and I think that they were so uncannily intelligent,

507
00:24:37.622 --> 00:24:41.522
that they knew that, even though what we call 2012,

508
00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:45.370
in the Mayan long count, mathematically speaking,

509
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.201
is 13.0.0.0,

510
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:51.841
they don't have a fixed starting point date,

511
00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:53.872
everything is different cycles,

512
00:24:53.872 --> 00:24:57.482
it's a cycle of 13 baktuns ends there,

513
00:24:57.482 --> 00:25:00.082
but I think they were uncannily intelligent enough

514
00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:01.798
to know that, by that time,

515
00:25:01.798 --> 00:25:04.190
the Gregorian-Babylonian calendar,

516
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.169
it would be the year 2012,

517
00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:08.690
and it would have this particular symbolism,

518
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.564
as I mentioned, 20 of the Mayan count,

519
00:25:10.564 --> 00:25:12.387
and they follow the Babylonian meaning,

520
00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:16.024
the final convergence of the Babylonian and Mayan,

521
00:25:16.024 --> 00:25:18.416
but then that dissolves, because the next year,

522
00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:22.470
2013, which is the 13-20 Mayan frequency.

523
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.101
<v Regina>Now, how does this, how did Egypt play into this?</v>

524
00:25:27.101 --> 00:25:30.971
<v ->Well, the Egyptians were very interesting,</v>

525
00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:33.519
they were actually, I believe,

526
00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:38.071
what we call monitored by the Sirians, the Sirius star,

527
00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:41.604
okay, as the Mayans were somewhat that, too,

528
00:25:41.604 --> 00:25:44.593
and they, the Egyptians actually,

529
00:25:44.593 --> 00:25:45.840
at an early time,

530
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.780
had a 13-month, 28-day calendar,

531
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.249
later on, and they adopted more or less

532
00:25:53.249 --> 00:25:57.568
the Babylonian 12-month, 30-day, plus five extra days,

533
00:25:57.568 --> 00:26:02.551
but they were not the same as the Babylonians view, okay?

534
00:26:02.551 --> 00:26:05.528
<v Regina>Yes, that's often confused,</v>

535
00:26:05.528 --> 00:26:08.337
which is why I wanted you to bring that up.

536
00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:12.130
Okay, now, one thing that both cultures had in mind,

537
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.626
the Mayan culture and the Egyptian culture had in mind,

538
00:26:14.626 --> 00:26:17.174
also Sumerian, and again, this is where

539
00:26:17.174 --> 00:26:22.166
we don't really understand necessarily

540
00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:25.130
the intention of all these cultures, clearly,

541
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.730
from back in this time, but I'd like to get

542
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.434
into the notion of the focal point of the sun,

543
00:26:30.434 --> 00:26:32.046
because this is hotly debated.

544
00:26:32.046 --> 00:26:34.230
There are those who say the Sumerian culture,

545
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.457
you see the symbol of the sun, sun bad, worship of sun bad,

546
00:26:37.457 --> 00:26:40.366
not bad in Egypt, not bad in the Mayan culture,

547
00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:43.174
not bad in the druidic and other cultures, as well,

548
00:26:43.174 --> 00:26:46.242
or in Incan cultures, so what is--

549
00:26:46.242 --> 00:26:49.023
and I know that you understand the sun

550
00:26:49.023 --> 00:26:52.403
on a more esoteric level than many people do,

551
00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:55.003
can you talk about the role of the sun,

552
00:26:55.003 --> 00:26:56.875
and its information systems?

553
00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:59.114
<v ->The basic--</v>

554
00:26:59.114 --> 00:27:01.399
the sun, of course, is a star,

555
00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:05.143
so we have to realize it, and as a star,

556
00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:09.819
any star is like, a super, star system,

557
00:27:09.819 --> 00:27:11.483
especially with planets, it's like

558
00:27:11.483 --> 00:27:15.510
a large atom, or atomic structure,

559
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.994
the sun is the nucleus, and then planets going around,

560
00:27:18.994 --> 00:27:22.010
in orbit, those are the electrons, okay?

561
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.457
So that's the first level.

562
00:27:24.457 --> 00:27:26.641
Second level is, as a star,

563
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:31.214
the sun is a pulsing, vibrating,

564
00:27:31.214 --> 00:27:33.817
actually multi-dimensional system,

565
00:27:33.817 --> 00:27:37.010
we see the third-dimensional aspect of it

566
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:41.638
as this thing that gives heat and light, okay, basically,

567
00:27:41.638 --> 00:27:46.370
but also it is actually the source of

568
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:52.581
the vitality of the living systems, okay,

569
00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:55.105
in other words, why is that?

570
00:27:55.105 --> 00:27:58.693
Because we have, for instance,

571
00:27:58.693 --> 00:28:00.640
on this planet, we have the possibility

572
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.512
of what we speak of as organic matter,

573
00:28:02.512 --> 00:28:05.788
and organic matter requires several things,

574
00:28:05.788 --> 00:28:08.492
it requires solar radiation,

575
00:28:08.492 --> 00:28:10.778
and it requires H2O,

576
00:28:10.778 --> 00:28:13.691
okay, and oxygen,

577
00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:18.691
an oxygen carbon dioxide cycle, so if the solar--

578
00:28:18.735 --> 00:28:21.491
if there were not solar radiation,

579
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:23.259
none of the rest of it would go.

580
00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:25.703
So that's the primal thing.

581
00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:29.353
Okay, so we say, of course, life depends on the sun,

582
00:28:29.353 --> 00:28:32.361
but as we've learned more recently,

583
00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:34.435
the sun actually

584
00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:39.271
is a pulsating electromagnetic organism

585
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:43.743
and its main, the main way that we know about

586
00:28:43.743 --> 00:28:47.693
its living is through, it's called

587
00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:49.981
a binary sunspot cycle,

588
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:52.997
the binary sunspot cycle is that they start

589
00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:56.481
about a 11, 11-and-a-half year cycle,

590
00:28:56.481 --> 00:29:00.277
say, a negative spot here and a positive spot here,

591
00:29:00.277 --> 00:29:03.397
they pulse down until they hit the equator,

592
00:29:03.397 --> 00:29:05.844
and at the equator, they switch,

593
00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:08.808
and it just goes negative and then it becomes positive,

594
00:29:08.808 --> 00:29:10.680
and this negative down here,

595
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.446
and then they complete the cycle about every 23 years.

596
00:29:13.446 --> 00:29:15.071
So during, that's--

597
00:29:15.071 --> 00:29:19.085
those pulsations are sending information

598
00:29:19.085 --> 00:29:22.936
into the Earth's electromagnetic field, okay.

599
00:29:22.936 --> 00:29:26.573
That information, solar information,

600
00:29:26.573 --> 00:29:28.459
information that gets

601
00:29:28.459 --> 00:29:32.800
digested and processed into, say,

602
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.502
evolutionary information, it gets processed,

603
00:29:36.502 --> 00:29:40.662
maybe into more a planet develops possibilities

604
00:29:40.662 --> 00:29:43.626
of intelligence, then, and it gets translated

605
00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:47.135
into intelligent information, as well, ideas,

606
00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:50.607
all that everything that gets pulled from the sun,

607
00:29:50.607 --> 00:29:53.415
because the Earth's electromagnetic field

608
00:29:53.415 --> 00:29:55.963
is intimately connected with the sun,

609
00:29:55.963 --> 00:29:57.887
with the solar sunspot cycles,

610
00:29:57.887 --> 00:30:02.442
the radiation center field, and the field

611
00:30:02.442 --> 00:30:05.715
gathers the radiations and the pulsations,

612
00:30:05.715 --> 00:30:09.355
and then it stores them, now, a planet

613
00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:11.589
like our planet,

614
00:30:11.589 --> 00:30:14.969
which sustains intelligent life,

615
00:30:14.969 --> 00:30:18.664
or life capable of receiving intelligent information

616
00:30:18.664 --> 00:30:20.845
from the rest of the cosmos,

617
00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:23.705
then that planet develops the final

618
00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:26.070
subtle etheric sphere, which is the noosphere,

619
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.358
the mental sphere of the planet,

620
00:30:28.358 --> 00:30:30.698
the noosphere operates in tandem with the mental--

621
00:30:30.698 --> 00:30:33.714
excuse me, with the electromagnetic field,

622
00:30:33.714 --> 00:30:36.210
and so the information coming from the sun

623
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.294
and other cosmic radiation, comes and affects the noosphere,

624
00:30:40.294 --> 00:30:43.726
and the noosphere actually, we don't know that much about it

625
00:30:43.726 --> 00:30:47.238
at this point in time, but there is an aspect

626
00:30:47.238 --> 00:30:49.860
of the noosphere that functions

627
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.552
as an information storage and retrieval system,

628
00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:57.556
and it operates as the mechanism regulating

629
00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:01.456
the timing cycles, or regulating the different,

630
00:31:01.456 --> 00:31:04.950
the timing of the different evolutionary cycles

631
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.018
of the life programs on Earth.

632
00:31:08.018 --> 00:31:10.450
All that is one

633
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.008
actually integrated whole, the sun,

634
00:31:13.008 --> 00:31:15.418
down to the electromagnetic fields, to the noosphere.

635
00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:17.085
<v Regina>Which is in fact, which certainly</v>

636
00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:18.851
is connected to the electromagnetic functioning

637
00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:21.191
of even the human mental system and brain.

638
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:22.959
<v ->Yeah, the human brain, exactly.</v>

639
00:31:22.959 --> 00:31:26.401
So we're all, actually, I talk about the fact

640
00:31:26.401 --> 00:31:29.937
that once we get past this 2012 hump,

641
00:31:29.937 --> 00:31:33.837
our destiny is to become biosolar telepaths,

642
00:31:33.837 --> 00:31:36.764
that we realize our biological nature

643
00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:38.750
is totally hooked up to our solar nature,

644
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.038
is what the ancients spoke of

645
00:31:41.038 --> 00:31:42.769
as the coming sixth sign of consciousness

646
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:44.485
of the new solar age,

647
00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:46.177
and the new solar age is when we realize

648
00:31:46.177 --> 00:31:49.404
that our consciousness is intimately related to the sun,

649
00:31:49.404 --> 00:31:53.665
to the solar radiation and the information rays of the sun,

650
00:31:53.665 --> 00:31:57.097
so our biological nature, our consciousness

651
00:31:57.097 --> 00:32:01.594
is regulated by the solar pulsations,

652
00:32:01.594 --> 00:32:04.766
and that when we integrate the biological and the solar,

653
00:32:04.766 --> 00:32:07.158
and we activate our telepathic powers,

654
00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:09.627
and then we become biosolar telepaths.

655
00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:13.423
This is something of what, say, for instance,

656
00:32:13.423 --> 00:32:16.360
the ancient Mayans or Mexicans or Incas

657
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.159
or Egyptians knew, the so-called sun worshippers,

658
00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:23.276
that they actually knew that the sun

659
00:32:23.276 --> 00:32:25.616
is the regulator of human consciousness,

660
00:32:25.616 --> 00:32:28.892
and that's why they were paying attention to it.

661
00:32:28.892 --> 00:32:30.504
<v Regina>And everywhere I read,</v>

662
00:32:30.504 --> 00:32:33.832
I would say it's beyond synchronicity at this point,

663
00:32:33.832 --> 00:32:36.432
I keep reading different takes, different kinds

664
00:32:36.432 --> 00:32:38.926
of information about the sun,

665
00:32:38.926 --> 00:32:41.162
even NASA understand that in 2012,

666
00:32:41.162 --> 00:32:44.750
they expect a great amount of solar wind

667
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.454
and solar flare activity, and yet,

668
00:32:47.454 --> 00:32:49.950
no one's really putting all the pieces together

669
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.872
in terms of what that means in the global shift

670
00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:53.754
of consciousness at that time,

671
00:32:53.754 --> 00:32:56.562
so I very much appreciate what you just said about that,

672
00:32:56.562 --> 00:33:01.084
and I did read from an esoteric text that I'm familiar with,

673
00:33:01.084 --> 00:33:04.516
that until we understand what the sun is,

674
00:33:04.516 --> 00:33:07.688
the new technologies that we will be utilizing

675
00:33:07.688 --> 00:33:10.796
in our future cannot be unveiled yet.

676
00:33:10.796 --> 00:33:13.419
<v ->Yeah, I totally agree with that.</v>

677
00:33:13.419 --> 00:33:17.683
You know, the ancient Mayans knew about this.

678
00:33:17.683 --> 00:33:20.024
It's why I refer to them as the galactic Mayans,

679
00:33:20.024 --> 00:33:22.052
the ones who were incarnated

680
00:33:22.052 --> 00:33:25.848
and established themselves as the Mayans here.

681
00:33:25.848 --> 00:33:28.219
They knew about this, and they had

682
00:33:28.219 --> 00:33:32.661
a very sophisticated language to describe it,

683
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:36.435
and one of the terms that they use is (foreign language),

684
00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:41.001
which is the paranormal or telepathic powers

685
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:44.287
that the human being has that are directly connected

686
00:33:44.287 --> 00:33:46.211
to the solar radiation,

687
00:33:46.211 --> 00:33:47.811
(foreign language)

688
00:33:47.811 --> 00:33:50.359
telepathy and solar radiation,

689
00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:53.947
and have a common--

690
00:33:53.947 --> 00:33:57.590
actually, they're a common medium, right?

691
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.031
<v Regina>What about our directly interfacing with the sun,</v>

692
00:34:00.031 --> 00:34:02.787
with that intention, say, in solar gazing,

693
00:34:02.787 --> 00:34:05.048
as the sun rises first thing in the morning?

694
00:34:05.048 --> 00:34:06.685
<v ->Well, I think, yeah, I've done some solar gazing</v>

695
00:34:06.685 --> 00:34:08.297
myself, I think that's a great thing,

696
00:34:08.297 --> 00:34:10.479
and I think that also,

697
00:34:10.479 --> 00:34:12.740
if you were at my talk this morning,

698
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.433
I spoke about the living matter being either

699
00:34:16.433 --> 00:34:20.229
autotrophic or heterotrophic, okay,

700
00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:22.520
and I believe that

701
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.677
as we evolve, and as the noosphere represents

702
00:34:26.677 --> 00:34:30.418
the next great era or eon, okay,

703
00:34:30.418 --> 00:34:32.888
because I see it lasts a long time,

704
00:34:32.888 --> 00:34:35.688
as we evolve more and more into a more

705
00:34:35.688 --> 00:34:40.108
purely mental, spiritual forms even, okay,

706
00:34:40.108 --> 00:34:43.461
and along the way, we will become--

707
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:46.789
we'll stop being heterotrophs,

708
00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:48.973
we'll become planetary autotrophs.

709
00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:50.949
<v Regina>And explain the division of the two.</v>

710
00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:55.161
<v ->Okay, autotroph doesn't take from the environment,</v>

711
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:57.709
just whatever solar radiation comes in,

712
00:34:57.709 --> 00:35:01.245
whatever moisture comes in, whatever minerals come up

713
00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:04.833
from the roots, it absorbs directly into its own system

714
00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:08.369
either through osmosis or through the solar rays

715
00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:10.321
penetrating and then it transforms them

716
00:35:10.321 --> 00:35:12.502
into chlorophyll and so on,

717
00:35:12.502 --> 00:35:15.986
whereas heterotrophs are basically

718
00:35:15.986 --> 00:35:18.305
all the animal forms of life, from insects

719
00:35:18.305 --> 00:35:22.358
up to the human beings, where we depend

720
00:35:22.358 --> 00:35:26.179
on symbiotic relationships, with ingesting other life forms,

721
00:35:26.179 --> 00:35:29.507
whether it's plants or other animal forms,

722
00:35:29.507 --> 00:35:32.187
to sustain ourselves, okay, and so then

723
00:35:32.187 --> 00:35:35.691
we create all these different cycles.

724
00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:39.230
So right now, we know that there's a tendency

725
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:43.751
that started that is going towards vegetarian

726
00:35:43.751 --> 00:35:47.183
and vegan and raw food, juices,

727
00:35:47.183 --> 00:35:50.692
and even every so often, someone will show up

728
00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:53.916
and say, "Hey, I'm a breatharian, I've done it."

729
00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:57.192
Well, that's basically the idea, is that we will

730
00:35:57.192 --> 00:35:59.245
end up, as we go more and more

731
00:35:59.245 --> 00:36:03.668
into a more pure mental and spiritual light form of being

732
00:36:03.668 --> 00:36:06.342
that we'll become planetary autotrophs,

733
00:36:06.342 --> 00:36:10.812
we'll cease to have the symbiotic relationships

734
00:36:10.812 --> 00:36:13.568
with other forms, we will take in cosmic

735
00:36:13.568 --> 00:36:18.169
and solar radiation and water, just absorb it

736
00:36:18.169 --> 00:36:21.493
from the environment and that we will

737
00:36:21.493 --> 00:36:24.769
evolve more refined organs

738
00:36:24.769 --> 00:36:29.449
to metabolize this, and we will

739
00:36:29.449 --> 00:36:32.908
synthesize certain,

740
00:36:34.548 --> 00:36:36.803
what you might call even,

741
00:36:36.803 --> 00:36:40.052
spectral forms of matter that we'll be able

742
00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:42.647
to project out from ourselves,

743
00:36:42.647 --> 00:36:47.483
and various other things, but that's what I believe

744
00:36:47.483 --> 00:36:50.759
the final stage of the evolution is headed.

745
00:36:50.759 --> 00:36:52.475
<v Regina>So this is really hinged</v>

746
00:36:52.475 --> 00:36:54.659
about our relationship with the sun,

747
00:36:54.659 --> 00:36:56.687
and that the relationship with the sun

748
00:36:56.687 --> 00:36:59.339
directly affects our sense of organic time.

749
00:36:59.339 --> 00:37:02.719
And then now to kind of move further

750
00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:06.047
and become more complete in that,

751
00:37:06.047 --> 00:37:08.801
the sense of time and technology,

752
00:37:08.801 --> 00:37:11.297
how do you see that going?

753
00:37:11.297 --> 00:37:13.585
<v ->Well, the time and technology,</v>

754
00:37:13.585 --> 00:37:16.809
the technology that we have today

755
00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:19.880
is all based on artificial time, okay.

756
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.217
So we say, by the biosphere,

757
00:37:22.217 --> 00:37:24.765
and then we created this intermediate structure

758
00:37:24.765 --> 00:37:27.677
called the technosphere, so based on transportation,

759
00:37:27.677 --> 00:37:30.641
energy systems, and urban centers,

760
00:37:30.641 --> 00:37:32.825
and communication system,

761
00:37:32.825 --> 00:37:36.079
all as an inter-related whole, you know,

762
00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:39.407
that creates the whole of the civilization,

763
00:37:39.407 --> 00:37:42.423
the whole globalization as we know it.

764
00:37:42.423 --> 00:37:45.595
But all that's based on artificial time.

765
00:37:45.595 --> 00:37:50.571
All of this technology is an artificial extrusion

766
00:37:50.571 --> 00:37:54.815
of ourselves, okay, and so,

767
00:37:54.815 --> 00:37:58.413
as we create this artificial extrusion of ourselves

768
00:37:58.413 --> 00:38:01.325
in the form of all this technological world

769
00:38:01.325 --> 00:38:03.564
that we created, inside of ourselves,

770
00:38:03.564 --> 00:38:05.748
our souls are rather empty.

771
00:38:05.748 --> 00:38:08.657
<v Regina>Yes, that's become the exterior.</v>

772
00:38:08.657 --> 00:38:11.272
<v ->This trade-off, but the artificial time,</v>

773
00:38:11.272 --> 00:38:13.820
you know, can't hold.

774
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.420
<v Regina>So what would technology look like,</v>

775
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.500
with an organic time?

776
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.965
<v ->Technology is going, we're going to be</v>

777
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:24.528
talking about solar telepathic technologies,

778
00:38:24.528 --> 00:38:26.802
okay, which is very different, we're talking

779
00:38:26.802 --> 00:38:30.506
about different--

780
00:38:30.506 --> 00:38:34.406
utilizing, well, what I think in the initial stages,

781
00:38:34.406 --> 00:38:37.370
utilizing things like solar and wind and so on,

782
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.344
just to get us on another track,

783
00:38:40.344 --> 00:38:43.880
and then I think also the zero-point energy,

784
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.428
the vacuum energy fields,

785
00:38:46.428 --> 00:38:49.083
and then from there, to then, we'll begin

786
00:38:49.083 --> 00:38:52.624
to develop and utilize much more, what I call,

787
00:38:52.624 --> 00:38:55.699
telepathic technologies, in other words, telepathic--

788
00:38:55.699 --> 00:38:58.195
I consider, like, the crop circles

789
00:38:58.195 --> 00:39:01.367
as manifestations of telepathic technology,

790
00:39:01.367 --> 00:39:04.555
those are direct,

791
00:39:04.555 --> 00:39:09.545
those are direct imprints of focused thoughts

792
00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:14.542
of a relatively complex, often geometrical

793
00:39:14.542 --> 00:39:17.836
if not symbolic nature that are just impressed in the field,

794
00:39:17.836 --> 00:39:20.228
that's telepathic technology.

795
00:39:20.228 --> 00:39:23.296
<v Regina>The little orbs that they capture,</v>

796
00:39:23.296 --> 00:39:24.884
oftentimes, that are there and present,

797
00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:27.224
do you think it's from that or something beyond that?

798
00:39:27.224 --> 00:39:29.047
<v ->I think that's maybe something else.</v>

799
00:39:29.047 --> 00:39:31.072
<v Regina>Yeah, maybe something else entirely.</v>

800
00:39:31.072 --> 00:39:33.568
So looking at technology in the future,

801
00:39:33.568 --> 00:39:35.693
there was an interesting event yesterday

802
00:39:35.693 --> 00:39:38.367
when Irulan Roberts led the group into a meditation

803
00:39:38.367 --> 00:39:40.707
and you could put yourself into the future

804
00:39:40.707 --> 00:39:42.583
and what it looked like, and I interviewed

805
00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:44.198
Barbara Marx Hubbard right after that,

806
00:39:44.198 --> 00:39:46.431
and she and I had, essentially, the same vision,

807
00:39:46.431 --> 00:39:49.426
slight variances, where it was this very organic sense

808
00:39:49.426 --> 00:39:51.815
of time, organic sense of life,

809
00:39:51.815 --> 00:39:54.002
living in close companionship with the Earth,

810
00:39:54.002 --> 00:39:57.174
highly telepathic, but we were in the presence

811
00:39:57.174 --> 00:39:59.774
of computer monitors, but it was connecting us

812
00:39:59.774 --> 00:40:02.329
with everything that's possible, is, anyone you needed

813
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:05.085
to be in communion with anywhere on the planet

814
00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:08.833
and beyond was right there, so it is quite possible,

815
00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:12.632
it seemed to me, it seemed quite harmonious and beautiful,

816
00:40:12.632 --> 00:40:15.749
that even the types of technology that we have,

817
00:40:15.749 --> 00:40:17.711
in primitive form and given birth to,

818
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:19.787
are going to work very well

819
00:40:19.787 --> 00:40:21.764
with the organic sense of time down the road.

820
00:40:21.764 --> 00:40:23.428
<v ->Yeah, it could be.</v>

821
00:40:23.428 --> 00:40:25.404
It could be.

822
00:40:25.404 --> 00:40:27.744
Right now, what we're dealing with right now

823
00:40:27.744 --> 00:40:30.008
is that we've been too immature

824
00:40:30.008 --> 00:40:31.880
to deal with the technologies.

825
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.492
<v Regina>Absolutely, you bet.</v>

826
00:40:33.492 --> 00:40:36.144
<v ->We've been too immature to deal with them,</v>

827
00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:38.487
we've developed, we became infatuated

828
00:40:38.487 --> 00:40:40.391
with the clock, developed a runaway system

829
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:41.954
that we never tested,

830
00:40:43.404 --> 00:40:47.709
and it's making morons and obese freaks out of us.

831
00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:51.453
And so what we have to, you know,

832
00:40:51.453 --> 00:40:54.785
look at that, and so there has to be

833
00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:58.425
some kind of moratorium on all this,

834
00:40:58.425 --> 00:41:00.817
so we can recalibrate our intelligence,

835
00:41:00.817 --> 00:41:04.988
and see what it is that we actually do need,

836
00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:10.082
because the thing is, I always say, that's really funny,

837
00:41:10.082 --> 00:41:13.829
for 25,900 years,

838
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:16.454
homo sapiens did fairly well without cars,

839
00:41:16.454 --> 00:41:18.589
and now it can't do without them,

840
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:22.881
or for 25,960 years,

841
00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:25.273
homo sapiens did without computers,

842
00:41:25.273 --> 00:41:26.833
and now it can't do without them,

843
00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:30.265
and for 25,990 years, homo sapiens did

844
00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:33.437
without cell phones, and it really can't do without them.

845
00:41:33.437 --> 00:41:34.924
<v Regina>That is so true.</v>

846
00:41:34.924 --> 00:41:38.052
<v ->And so it's like, you know, hey, wait a minute,</v>

847
00:41:38.052 --> 00:41:41.120
we have to stop this process,

848
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.460
it's just, it's a runaway technology,

849
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.048
it's having all sorts of effects on our psyche,

850
00:41:47.048 --> 00:41:49.703
on our social psyche, on our personal psyche,

851
00:41:49.703 --> 00:41:53.264
that we can't even control, and we're all

852
00:41:53.264 --> 00:41:56.696
just like, kind of sit around, helpless, you know,

853
00:41:56.696 --> 00:41:59.303
and watch our kids go crazy.

854
00:41:59.303 --> 00:42:01.120
<v Regina>Well, maybe that moratorium</v>

855
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.307
will come as a result of the disintegration

856
00:42:03.307 --> 00:42:05.495
of the current systems, which the consciousness

857
00:42:05.495 --> 00:42:07.162
seems to be forcing.

858
00:42:07.162 --> 00:42:09.031
<v ->Yeah, I think that we're going to,</v>

859
00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:10.383
that's what we're going to be seeing,

860
00:42:10.383 --> 00:42:14.023
as we get into the 2012 arena,

861
00:42:14.023 --> 00:42:16.779
and as we get there, I think a solar flare

862
00:42:16.779 --> 00:42:18.887
may help us, assist us with that.

863
00:42:18.887 --> 00:42:21.383
But I think it's very important, in that regard,

864
00:42:21.383 --> 00:42:26.115
that people be educated to this possibility,

865
00:42:26.115 --> 00:42:29.211
and so that people aren't going,

866
00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:32.197
running around freaking because they can't text, okay,

867
00:42:33.553 --> 00:42:37.093
we have to educate for this possibility.

868
00:42:37.093 --> 00:42:40.632
We've, like, we've created a race

869
00:42:40.632 --> 00:42:44.789
of highly technologically dependent people,

870
00:42:44.789 --> 00:42:47.493
and that's what I mean, how we've lost touch

871
00:42:47.493 --> 00:42:51.084
with our own nature, and with the greater nature,

872
00:42:51.084 --> 00:42:54.097
and so I'm just hoping that in the next couple years

873
00:42:54.097 --> 00:42:56.541
that there will be enough people who are awakening

874
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.869
to this so we have enough sense of social conscience

875
00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:02.368
and responsibility, who will be able to begin

876
00:43:02.368 --> 00:43:05.173
to communicate something of this,

877
00:43:05.173 --> 00:43:09.177
so that when we begin to experience

878
00:43:09.177 --> 00:43:12.401
an ever greater technological breakdown,

879
00:43:12.401 --> 00:43:15.625
an ever greater economic collapse and failure,

880
00:43:15.625 --> 00:43:18.017
that we realize, hey, we're okay,

881
00:43:18.017 --> 00:43:21.917
money is just like an illusion, don't worry,

882
00:43:21.917 --> 00:43:24.673
we lived without this technology all this time,

883
00:43:24.673 --> 00:43:26.274
just learn how to grow a garden,

884
00:43:26.274 --> 00:43:28.146
relax, it's all going to get better.

885
00:43:28.146 --> 00:43:30.833
<v Regina>Well, on that note, I agree so much.</v>

886
00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:32.601
Thank you so much for your time, Jos√©.

887
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:36.452
<v ->Thank you for your questions and your thoughtfulness.</v>

888
00:43:36.452 --> 00:43:37.801
Thank you.

889
00:43:39.751 --> 00:43:41.032
<v ->To understand more about</v>

890
00:43:41.032 --> 00:43:42.779
the Mayan versus Gregorian calendar,

891
00:43:42.779 --> 00:43:44.703
you can go to LawOfTime.org.

892
00:43:44.703 --> 00:43:47.716
Jos√© has a beautiful explanation of the new time there,

893
00:43:47.716 --> 00:43:50.368
as well as videos that show the energetics at work.

894
00:43:50.368 --> 00:43:52.867
