00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.669
<v ->We had the privilege of meeting up</v>

2
00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.609
once again with Gary Schwartz.

3
00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:05.269
Last time we saw him, we were in London

4
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:06.879
eating sushi together.

5
00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:08.789
In this interview, Gary shares his views

6
00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.909
on what he calls self-science.

7
00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.369
As a professor of medicine and psychology,

8
00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.889
it's been a long journey to come to the conclusion

9
00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.769
that we cannot wait for science

10
00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.889
to validate what each one of us inherently knows,

11
00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:23.469
that we must practice our own science

12
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.039
in our search for the greater truths.

13
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.689
<v Woman>Since we last interviewed you,</v>

14
00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.369
not since we last saw you,

15
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.169
you have been on an incredible, magical journey

16
00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:40.829
which is quite interesting because you are a man who

17
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.849
epitomizes the world of science

18
00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:45.719
and left-brain thinking on paper.

19
00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.769
And in fact, that was your path, that has been your path.

20
00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:49.769
<v ->And continues to be my path.</v>

21
00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.309
<v Woman>And continues to be your path</v>

22
00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.309
yet you seem to be embracing the magic of synchronicity

23
00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.189
and I'm going to have you tell a story that's just fabulous

24
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.589
a little bit later, but first along that path of discovery

25
00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.949
you talk about the world of self-science.

26
00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:09.469
Now coming from your world, what does this mean

27
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.249
and how did you get there?

28
00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:14.029
<v ->Self-science, well the term self-science actually</v>

29
00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:18.319
occurred to me relatively recently, within the past year.

30
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.189
Also in the past year, I published a book called

31
00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.129
The G.O.D. Experiments, the God experiments,

32
00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:28.329
which stands for guiding, organizing, designing process.

33
00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.869
With the subtitle "How Science is Discovering God

34
00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.789
"in Everything Including Us".

35
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.529
And it turns out that a subset of that book

36
00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.529
includes experiments where I was the subject.

37
00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.629
And because I'm so scientifically trained

38
00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:48.669
and scientifically minded, as I began to discover anomalies

39
00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:52.969
or try to experiment with things in my own personal life,

40
00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.669
and then I would be hit with evidence

41
00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.919
that I could not dismiss.

42
00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.689
I began to realize that there was this process

43
00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.929
of when you apply science to yourself,

44
00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.209
that you can make certain discoveries

45
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.469
which may be inconsistent with the way in which

46
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.509
you've been educated.

47
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.585
<v Woman>Oh well yes. (laughs)</v>

48
00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.425
<v ->And not only that, I was actually beginning to meet people</v>

49
00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.365
in fact I had been for some time,

50
00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:19.965
where they were also on their paths,

51
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:24.105
and whether they were physicians, or psychologists,

52
00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:29.105
or physicists, or artists, or even one gentleman

53
00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:32.505
who I actually describe in The God Experiments books,

54
00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.925
he was an office cleaner.

55
00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.945
They would be making discoveries

56
00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:40.245
and then keeping track of the data

57
00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:42.725
and following the evidence where it took them,

58
00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.585
ultimately reaching them to conclusions that was

59
00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:47.985
inconsistent with the way in which they were raised

60
00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:49.885
but which they knew from the actual evidence

61
00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:51.665
and the repeated evidence was true.

62
00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.385
And then they went through their own personal transformation

63
00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.445
which led them on the path that they were on.

64
00:02:56.445 --> 00:03:00.025
And I was experiencing that myself in spades.

65
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:01.665
<v Woman>This is really critical.</v>

66
00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:04.885
This is a critical time in history as I've said

67
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.225
in so many interviews, and it's a cliche,

68
00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:10.505
but it is true that people like yourself

69
00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:14.005
are starting to experience this for themselves.

70
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.125
<v ->Yes, and I think what's slightly novel for me</v>

71
00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.305
is that I'm having the experience,

72
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.505
but because I'm doing it through the eyes of a scientist,

73
00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.865
I'm actually finding how I can use the tools of science

74
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:24.265
to apply it to myself, and I'm seeing

75
00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:25.725
other people do it as well.

76
00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:28.105
And so therefore, you can ultimately come to prove

77
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:30.325
to yourself that this is the case.

78
00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:32.145
And I'm currently now working on two books,

79
00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.625
both of which relate to the question of self-science.

80
00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:40.385
In one case, the whole book is based on experiences

81
00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:41.765
that I've been collecting over the years

82
00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:43.625
and continue to this day,

83
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.705
which is leading me to conclusions

84
00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:48.025
which were very different than the way I was raised.

85
00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:49.625
The second, which is a broader book,

86
00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.305
actually tells the story of eleven different people

87
00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:53.505
who have been on their path.

88
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:54.845
And that particular book, by the way,

89
00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:57.305
I call The Self-Awakening Experiments,

90
00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:00.825
and the subtitle is "Self-Science as the Key to

91
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:04.105
"Human Transformation and Global Healing."

92
00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:05.665
And I think that's what people are doing.

93
00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:07.125
By the way, that's what the ancient mystics did.

94
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.205
They were self-scientists.

95
00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:11.645
<v Woman>Right, but until now,</v>

96
00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:15.394
there's been a huge giggle factor attached to anything

97
00:04:15.394 --> 00:04:17.494
that doesn't have a double blind study.

98
00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:19.874
Now how do you feel about that at this point

99
00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:22.994
compared to maybe even five years ago.

100
00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:24.354
<v ->Well there's a time and a place, first of all,</v>

101
00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:25.694
for double blind studies.

102
00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:27.454
Of course it's very hard to do a double blind study

103
00:04:27.454 --> 00:04:28.774
when you yourself are the subject,

104
00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:30.734
unless you arrange it with other people

105
00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.654
to actually test you under double blind conditions,

106
00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:35.014
and I, by the way, have done that myself.

107
00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:37.494
But I think what's more important is that

108
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:41.154
people have to understand that the essence of discovery

109
00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:44.914
is not just other people finding out and then telling you

110
00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:47.474
and giving you their evidence and their conclusions,

111
00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:49.654
but the bottom line, ultimately, is how does it apply

112
00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:51.174
in your life?

113
00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.294
And can you... Does it fit within your own experience?

114
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.974
And can you use this to enhance your well-being

115
00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:58.934
and the well-being of others?

116
00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:01.353
So I've become ever stronger in recognizing

117
00:05:01.353 --> 00:05:03.913
science shouldn't be left to the scientists.

118
00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:06.693
Science should be part of all of our lives,

119
00:05:06.693 --> 00:05:09.353
and therefore, we should all become in our own ways...

120
00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:11.713
Our life is a laboratory.

121
00:05:11.713 --> 00:05:15.933
<v Woman>It is, and our bodies and our electrical fields</v>

122
00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:18.213
and all of it is a laboratory.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

123
00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:20.673
<v Woman>And if science is the pursuit of truth,</v>

124
00:05:20.673 --> 00:05:24.313
then where do you find the truth in self-science?

125
00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:25.553
How do you recognize it?

126
00:05:25.553 --> 00:05:27.793
<v ->Even more interesting is that certain truths</v>

127
00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:31.353
can only be discovered through self-science.

128
00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:33.913
Matter of fact, I was just thinking about this this morning.

129
00:05:33.913 --> 00:05:37.493
Here at this conference, where I was looking at a particular

130
00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:42.493
set of connections, where only I, who had the data

131
00:05:43.273 --> 00:05:46.593
about my particular life, would know that at a particular

132
00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:49.693
dinner, when a particular set of information occurred,

133
00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:52.453
that that information was salient, number one, to me,

134
00:05:52.453 --> 00:05:53.793
and then I would later see it connected

135
00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:57.053
to this whole web of other things happening,

136
00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:59.553
so I am the one to connect the dots.

137
00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:01.273
I mean others can help us connect the dots,

138
00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:03.973
but ultimately, only we have the total collection

139
00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:05.213
of our information.

140
00:06:05.213 --> 00:06:07.313
It means of course we have to become better witnesses,

141
00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:09.053
we have to become better observers of self,

142
00:06:09.053 --> 00:06:11.413
we have to become more reliable

143
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.873
in our tracking of the information,

144
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.913
otherwise we start... We can build castles of sand,

145
00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:17.993
we can make imaginary stories which don't actually

146
00:06:17.993 --> 00:06:20.553
fit with reality, so we have to check and double check

147
00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:23.372
and apply the best of science to ourselves.

148
00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:24.972
And when we do, there's all kinds of magic

149
00:06:24.972 --> 00:06:26.272
to be discovered.

150
00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:27.632
<v Woman>Well now how do you know the truth</v>

151
00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:29.532
when it's happening?

152
00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:31.172
<v ->Well I was sort of a...</v>

153
00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:32.892
I have a problem in this area

154
00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:37.472
because I was raised to be, as my writing partner puts it,

155
00:06:37.472 --> 00:06:39.331
an orthodox agnostic.

156
00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:42.101
<v Woman>(laughs) Okay.</v>

157
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.270
<v ->And what that means is whether the question is</v>

158
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.850
"Is there gravity?" or "Is there God?"

159
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.490
It doesn't matter what the question is,

160
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.990
my approach to life is, my answer is

161
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.650
I don't know, could be yes, could be know,

162
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.070
show me the data, I'm open.

163
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.030
Now the upside of that is, I've come to discover,

164
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.630
is it makes for actually a good scientist.

165
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.570
You're open minded, you're going to follow any hypothesis

166
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.170
whether it fits or does not fit

167
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.450
with the prevailing understanding or dogma.

168
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.290
But the downside is personal.

169
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.310
When do you have enough data to make a decision?

170
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Woman>Yes, that's why I asked this question.</v>

171
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.150
<v ->How much data do you have to collect</v>

172
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.250
under how many circumstances before you're willing to say

173
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.390
I give in, I give up, I surrender.

174
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.870
In our previous interview...

175
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.310
<v Woman>Or the hill which may just say</v>

176
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.290
Ah, I see, I know.

177
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.670
<v ->Yeah, some people, one or two pieces of information</v>

178
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.170
and they accept that it's true.

179
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.750
I'm so conservative in that regard

180
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.110
that I have to be hit over the head

181
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.010
over and over and over

182
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.170
and even when I've collected mounds of data,

183
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.510
if it's against the way in which I was raised,

184
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.350
I keep looking for excuses or alternative ways

185
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.830
to view the data before I'm going to come to a conclusion.

186
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.050
So it's a great challenge.

187
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.000
In fact, in a previous interview that we did about

188
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.129
the afterlife, I'm sure you remember...

189
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:56.049
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

190
00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:57.889
<v ->A year and a half or so after, I remember</v>

191
00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:59.129
being in the dining room one day

192
00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:02.645
and realizing and saying essentially to the universe,

193
00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:04.565
look, I've gotta have so much data

194
00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:07.105
that the data backs me into the corner

195
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:09.405
and I cannot escape.

196
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.645
Because if I could find a way to escape

197
00:08:11.645 --> 00:08:14.205
or to get back up the fence, I would.

198
00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:15.745
By the way, one of my students

199
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.825
a couple years ago said to me,

200
00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.335
you know Gary he says,

201
00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:23.335
you don't, when you fall off the fence,

202
00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:29.014
you don't give up the fence.

203
00:08:29.014 --> 00:08:30.774
What you do is you move the fence.

204
00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:31.794
<v Woman>(laughs)</v>

205
00:08:31.794 --> 00:08:33.794
<v ->So for me, the decision is when do I move the fence</v>

206
00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:35.654
to be at a new level to ask new questions.

207
00:08:35.654 --> 00:08:38.894
<v Woman>Right, right. So you still have to</v>

208
00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:41.074
go through this process, in fact I'm going to have you

209
00:08:41.074 --> 00:08:44.414
tell a story about your synchronous journey

210
00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:47.934
that's happening and still unfolding at this time

211
00:08:47.934 --> 00:08:50.594
in a little bit here, and it's interesting

212
00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:53.754
because you seem to marvel at each one,

213
00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:56.974
and it's, again, how many times does this have to go

214
00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:58.754
bonk, bonk, bonk before you realize,

215
00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:00.534
wow, this is all magic?

216
00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:02.854
And yet, you do understand that.

217
00:09:02.854 --> 00:09:04.494
You're learning you cannot avoid it.

218
00:09:04.494 --> 00:09:06.574
<v ->Well here's what I hope will never happen to me,</v>

219
00:09:06.574 --> 00:09:08.914
so I actively try to keep it alive.

220
00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:10.634
I never want to take it for granted.

221
00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:13.034
I never want to lose humility about it.

222
00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:17.694
I never want to lose appreciation for the wonder.

223
00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:19.434
<v Woman>The magic of it.</v>
<v ->The magic and mystery of it.</v>

224
00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.553
And so therefore, even though I may come to the conclusion

225
00:09:22.553 --> 00:09:25.733
yes this happens, and I can even look forward to it,

226
00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:27.933
I'm going to be as surprised and celebrated

227
00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:29.833
as a new piece of data comes along.

228
00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:31.273
<v Woman>It's more fun that way anyway.</v>

229
00:09:31.273 --> 00:09:33.713
<v ->And it absolutely nurtures the fun</v>

230
00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:37.813
and makes living even more exciting

231
00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:39.793
rather than less exciting...
<v Woman>I agree with you.</v>

232
00:09:39.793 --> 00:09:41.813
The more you have of these events.

233
00:09:41.813 --> 00:09:43.293
<v Woman>I've been having these kinds of events</v>

234
00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:45.213
for probably about 25 years,

235
00:09:45.213 --> 00:09:47.473
and even recognizing and connecting the dots,

236
00:09:47.473 --> 00:09:50.593
yet every time, I still feel like a child

237
00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:51.793
and it still amazes me.

238
00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:55.313
Why? Well I don't know why, but it makes it feel better.

239
00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:57.013
Actually I enjoy it even more as a result

240
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.672
of not taking it for granted.
<v ->That is fantastic.</v>

241
00:09:58.672 --> 00:09:59.872
Well that's one of the reasons why

242
00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:01.192
not only did you ask me to do this interview,

243
00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:03.012
but you've insisted that I even tell the story,

244
00:10:03.012 --> 00:10:04.592
which I'm now agreeable to do.

245
00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:06.592
I should just share with you, by the way,

246
00:10:06.592 --> 00:10:10.292
that my first journey into the question of synchronicity

247
00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:12.492
occurred actually mathematically,

248
00:10:12.492 --> 00:10:14.152
and it had to do with a set of events

249
00:10:14.152 --> 00:10:16.212
that were related to the number 11.

250
00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:19.412
And then a whole series of synchronicities related to that

251
00:10:19.412 --> 00:10:21.452
and I ultimately included a chapter

252
00:10:21.452 --> 00:10:23.452
in The God Experiments book

253
00:10:23.452 --> 00:10:25.112
called Synchronicity in New York City

254
00:10:25.112 --> 00:10:26.952
where I illustrated how synchronicity,

255
00:10:26.952 --> 00:10:30.612
if it's of an extreme nature,

256
00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:33.052
can actually provide us with evidence

257
00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.492
for a larger process intelligence going on in life.

258
00:10:36.492 --> 00:10:38.632
I finished the chapter, it's in the book,

259
00:10:38.632 --> 00:10:40.712
and both my editor and writing partner said

260
00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:42.632
Gary, you can't include this in the book.

261
00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:45.612
He said, this is gonna push too many people

262
00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.652
beyond their boggle factor.

263
00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:49.532
And I said, but it happened.

264
00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:51.792
This is real data, I've got the evidence here.

265
00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:55.171
This is very important evidence, this is on the path.

266
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:57.231
So how do we deal with this?

267
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:58.231
So what I suggested was

268
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:00.151
look I have to keep this in the book,

269
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.051
so I put it in Appendix C

270
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:05.571
and I mentioned it briefly to the reader in the text

271
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:07.171
so some people could find out it was there.

272
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:08.591
<v Woman>That's where all the juicy stuff ends up.</v>

273
00:11:08.591 --> 00:11:09.591
<v ->Right, I put it in Appendix C,</v>

274
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:10.991
well often that's where a lot of boring stuff is

275
00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:13.191
but it's also, this is anything but boring,

276
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:17.931
and it's in Appendix C, and so it was published in that book

277
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:20.091
and at this particular conference

278
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:22.351
that you are interviewing me at,

279
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:24.431
I actually decided to come out of the closet

280
00:11:24.431 --> 00:11:27.491
and share some of the later sets of synchronicities

281
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:30.031
which are making up this other book

282
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:31.691
which is now almost completed.

283
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.331
<v Woman>Yes, and that was very brave of you.</v>

284
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:35.911
I'm glad you did that because it really set the stage

285
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:38.251
for now being able to share more openly

286
00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:40.251
some other, more magical things that have occurred.

287
00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:44.691
Do we even need to get into any of the science of this

288
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:45.731
at this time?

289
00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.391
Because what you talk about is that

290
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:49.911
order does not occur by chance, nor does randomness

291
00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:51.371
occur by chance.

292
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:53.771
Do you care to maybe set this up by explaining that?

293
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:56.551
<v ->Sure, I'll briefly explain this.</v>

294
00:11:56.551 --> 00:12:01.551
And this is described in some detail in The God Experiments.

295
00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:04.891
I accidentally, many years ago,

296
00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:09.191
this was early 1980s when I was a professor at Yale,

297
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.351
I came to realize that there was a fundamental inconsistency

298
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:16.731
disconnect between the statistics of

299
00:12:16.731 --> 00:12:19.671
how we understand probability and randomness,

300
00:12:19.671 --> 00:12:22.251
and systems theory and quantum physics,

301
00:12:22.251 --> 00:12:24.931
and the way the world actually works.

302
00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:27.891
And this disconnect is not recognized

303
00:12:27.891 --> 00:12:31.031
by most scientists today.

304
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:34.971
The simple way to understand this is in two ways.

305
00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:37.571
One is in sort of an experiment that anybody can do,

306
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:40.331
and the other is in a simple way of

307
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.171
understanding simply the logic.

308
00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:43.251
I'm gonna take you through the logic first

309
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:44.751
and the experiment second.

310
00:12:44.751 --> 00:12:46.111
Because the logic is slightly more boring

311
00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:49.131
and you'll be interested to know how to prove this yourself.

312
00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:52.831
In statistics we're told that in order to get

313
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:55.951
what's called a random distribution of numbers

314
00:12:55.951 --> 00:12:57.791
two things must be true.

315
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:00.151
One is that each event must be independent

316
00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:01.231
of every other event.

317
00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:03.991
So each time you flip the coin, the coin flip must be new.

318
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:06.111
The history of the previous coin flips

319
00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.351
can't affect the current flip.

320
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:10.411
And the second corollary of that is

321
00:13:10.411 --> 00:13:13.591
that the coin can't change over time.

322
00:13:13.591 --> 00:13:14.971
So if it's going to be independent,

323
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:17.691
therefore the coin can't wear out,

324
00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:19.171
you can't learn how to flip the coin,

325
00:13:19.171 --> 00:13:21.211
there can't be other forces that are operating on this

326
00:13:21.211 --> 00:13:22.311
and so on.

327
00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:25.091
And under conditions of complete independence

328
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:29.091
and absolute no change, and you can model this,

329
00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:31.991
you will actually get a normal distribution.

330
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:33.751
And the more times you flip the coins,

331
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:36.571
the more times you will get a perfect normal distribution.

332
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:39.411
And it happens 100 percent of the time.

333
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:41.571
100 percent of the time you get this distribution.

334
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.111
Now the question is, to what extent

335
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:46.711
does nature meet these criteria?

336
00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:48.811
Well here's what physics tells us.

337
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:52.091
Even Newton 300 years ago said

338
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:56.151
every object that has mass has a gravitational pull.

339
00:13:56.151 --> 00:13:58.751
This gravitational pull goes in all directions.

340
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:03.071
That means each object is pulling on every other object

341
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:04.511
in the universe, to various degrees,

342
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:07.731
and gravity extends out to infinity.

343
00:14:07.731 --> 00:14:10.031
So therefore it means that you can't move any one thing

344
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:13.041
without influencing or affecting any other thing.

345
00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:15.750
In fact, by the way, this vision of gravity,

346
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.210
of these invisible force fields

347
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.330
that held everything together unconditionally,

348
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.030
whether it was a white star, a black star, light dark,

349
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.810
didn't matter what was going on,

350
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.650
was completely unprejudicial attractive force

351
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.050
mutually holding everything together

352
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.810
and that was actually a scientific expression

353
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.910
of Darwin's vision of a loving divinity.

354
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.290
It was the invisible force of God.

355
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.810
Because he was also a mystic.

356
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.890
So gravity tells us you can't have randomness

357
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.150
in physical objects.

358
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.030
In fact physical objects aren't random.

359
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.870
We drop an object and it falls down

360
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.930
100 percent of the time.

361
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.410
There's no randomness here.

362
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.610
Secondly, then we look at what we learn

363
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.790
in electromagnetic fields.

364
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.230
Electromagnetic fields extend out into space,

365
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.690
and everything is connected to everything else

366
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.990
by electromagnetic fields.

367
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.690
So electrons and protons, all of these objects

368
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.870
that have any charges,

369
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.530
they can't be independent of everything else.

370
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.570
And then you get at the quantum level,

371
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.190
where you have entanglement...

372
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Woman>Absolute entanglement, yes.</v>

373
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.030
<v ->Even photons, which have been initially connected,</v>

374
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.890
no matter how far apart, you affect one,

375
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.470
the other one happens.

376
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.930
So if nothing in the universe is independent,

377
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.870
and then you add systems theory,

378
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.150
which says that anything that's ciruclating

379
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.510
actually creates and has feedback,

380
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.130
shows an evolution of memory over time,

381
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.670
and everything is a system according to systems theory,

382
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.950
the two very fundamental properties

383
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.730
to get randomness don't exist.
<v Woman>Don't exist, yes.</v>

384
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.670
<v ->If they don't exist,</v>

385
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.070
you can't use randomness as an explanation

386
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.430
for the origin and evolution of order in the universe

387
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.150
because the universe doesn't meet the criteria.

388
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.050
And in fact if you model the way the universe really is,

389
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.850
you don't get randomness.

390
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.090
That's why we see all this order in the universe.

391
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.130
So that was the initial conceptual realization.

392
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.230
Now I'll give you the playful, experimental one.

393
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.910
And the simplest way to say this,

394
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.690
particularly since we're in the southwest,

395
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:08.649
is to use an example of a sand painting.

396
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.888
And let me illustrate it by way of

397
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.048
doing a simple experiment.

398
00:16:13.048 --> 00:16:16.808
Imagine we have a plastic container

399
00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:18.548
and in it we have white sand.

400
00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:20.648
And what we do with black is we put

401
00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:23.028
a particular design on the sand.

402
00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:26.028
We make a cross, or we make a Jewish star,

403
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:28.628
or we draw a heart, or we draw a brain,

404
00:16:28.628 --> 00:16:31.228
or we write in the word God, G-O-D,

405
00:16:31.228 --> 00:16:33.488
or we write in the word dog, it doesn't matter.

406
00:16:33.488 --> 00:16:35.948
You put in a pattern.

407
00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:37.668
Then what we do is we put a cover on it,

408
00:16:37.668 --> 00:16:39.708
and it's nice if it's a clear plastic cover.

409
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.448
You shake it a little bit,

410
00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:43.088
then you open it and look what happens.

411
00:16:43.088 --> 00:16:44.408
You close it again, you shake it,

412
00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:45.568
you look what happens again.

413
00:16:45.568 --> 00:16:46.888
You shake it, you look what happens again.

414
00:16:46.888 --> 00:16:47.908
Here's the question.

415
00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:50.268
Does the cross turn into a star?

416
00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:52.368
Does the heart turn into a brain?

417
00:16:52.368 --> 00:16:55.848
Does the God turn into a dog or something else?

418
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.108
No.

419
00:16:57.108 --> 00:17:01.028
What happens is the sand mixes.

420
00:17:01.028 --> 00:17:03.008
And the more you shake it,

421
00:17:03.008 --> 00:17:05.468
the more the little black pieces begin

422
00:17:05.468 --> 00:17:10.188
to evenly distribute among the white pieces,

423
00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:12.928
and therefore, what this tells us is

424
00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:16.468
in the absence of an organizing agent,

425
00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:19.208
at least when we're dealing with sand,

426
00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:21.748
what nature does is it mixes.

427
00:17:21.748 --> 00:17:24.508
You get the same order over and over,

428
00:17:24.508 --> 00:17:28.808
which is this balanced mixture.

429
00:17:28.808 --> 00:17:30.968
So if in the absence of an organizing process,

430
00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:34.308
with sand right now, we know that what it does is it mixes.

431
00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:38.848
Then what would happen if we're walking along the beach

432
00:17:38.848 --> 00:17:41.728
and we came upon this beautiful colored

433
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:45.188
fiction painting of a... that we see, for example,

434
00:17:45.188 --> 00:17:47.408
the native American shamans make,

435
00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:49.028
what's the probability that it could've happened

436
00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:54.028
by, quote, "chance", meaning no organizing system.

437
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.408
Well the answer is zero.

438
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.548
It's not like the skeptic would say,

439
00:17:58.548 --> 00:17:59.588
or the atheist would say,

440
00:17:59.588 --> 00:18:01.988
well gee if we wait long enough,

441
00:18:01.988 --> 00:18:05.268
there's some chance that it's going to come together.

442
00:18:05.268 --> 00:18:06.708
No.

443
00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:08.728
What we can do, and if you don't trust this,

444
00:18:08.728 --> 00:18:09.748
do the experiment.

445
00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:11.468
Of course I didn't trust it, so I was doing

446
00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:14.088
shaking sands and I was doing all this stuff.

447
00:18:14.088 --> 00:18:16.228
You find out no, in fact what physics tells us,

448
00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:17.648
quite the contrary.

449
00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:18.528
It mixes.

450
00:18:18.528 --> 00:18:19.308
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

451
00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:21.188
<v ->And therefore, what's the probability</v>

452
00:18:21.188 --> 00:18:22.968
if we're walking along and we find some

453
00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:26.048
elegant, beautiful sand painting in the sand.

454
00:18:26.048 --> 00:18:27.767
What's the probability that some sort of

455
00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:29.787
a guiding, organizing, and designing process,

456
00:18:29.787 --> 00:18:31.807
in this case, it could be a human, or a little god,

457
00:18:31.807 --> 00:18:33.167
that was doing this.

458
00:18:33.167 --> 00:18:34.687
The answer is, it's 100 percent.

459
00:18:34.687 --> 00:18:38.067
And it was that realization, those two early realizations

460
00:18:38.067 --> 00:18:41.487
that set me on the path to becoming open

461
00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:46.487
to discovering organizing principles in nature.

462
00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:49.507
And that's what ultimately led to then, I think,

463
00:18:49.507 --> 00:18:52.417
to start seeing, among other things, synchronicities.

464
00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:53.627
<v Woman>Okay, so let's...</v>

465
00:18:53.627 --> 00:18:55.507
We're going to start along that journey

466
00:18:55.507 --> 00:18:57.247
and you just reminded me of something,

467
00:18:57.247 --> 00:19:00.687
maybe we'll talk about it toward the end,

468
00:19:00.687 --> 00:19:02.087
about organizing principles.

469
00:19:02.087 --> 00:19:06.767
But most people still to this day,

470
00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:10.167
when something happens of the synchronistic nature,

471
00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:11.887
say, oh, just a coincidence.

472
00:19:11.887 --> 00:19:13.587
Can you talk about how...

473
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.927
What is the correlation between

474
00:19:14.927 --> 00:19:19.087
the subject of randomness and coincidence?

475
00:19:19.087 --> 00:19:23.227
<v ->Well first of all, people use the word randomness</v>

476
00:19:23.227 --> 00:19:28.227
very loosely, and I will argue actually, inappropriately.

477
00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:33.067
So for example, we know, take the number for pi.

478
00:19:35.167 --> 00:19:37.847
Mathematicians have taken it out to billions of digits

479
00:19:37.847 --> 00:19:40.307
and they can't find, figure out what makes this

480
00:19:40.307 --> 00:19:42.387
pattern of numbers occur.

481
00:19:42.387 --> 00:19:43.647
And because they can't figure it out

482
00:19:43.647 --> 00:19:45.407
and it seems to have no repeating order,

483
00:19:45.407 --> 00:19:47.007
they call it, quote, "random."

484
00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:51.107
And yet, every time they divide the numbers,

485
00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.887
you get the same pattern.

486
00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:56.407
So how could something that's, quote, "random,"

487
00:19:56.407 --> 00:19:58.467
happen 100 percent of the time?

488
00:19:58.467 --> 00:19:59.887
There's a disconnect here.

489
00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:03.407
The alternative expression is it's not, quote, "random,"

490
00:20:03.407 --> 00:20:06.167
all that means is we're not yet smart enough

491
00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:07.507
to figure out what the pattern is.

492
00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:09.987
And we may never know what the complete set of rules are

493
00:20:09.987 --> 00:20:11.687
to create a particular pattern,

494
00:20:11.687 --> 00:20:13.347
but if it happens 100 percent of the time,

495
00:20:13.347 --> 00:20:15.627
it's not, quote, "random," by definition.

496
00:20:15.627 --> 00:20:17.147
So the word randomness, I think,

497
00:20:17.147 --> 00:20:19.747
is used very loosely and inappropriately.

498
00:20:19.747 --> 00:20:20.707
It's one of those great myths.

499
00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:22.627
We used to think the vacuum was empty,

500
00:20:22.627 --> 00:20:24.427
and then we know the vacuum is filled with energy,

501
00:20:24.427 --> 00:20:26.767
and information, and matter, and so on and so forth.

502
00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.796
So the word vacuum is the wrong word.

503
00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:29.796
We should get rid of that word.

504
00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:31.176
Well random is the wrong word.

505
00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:32.296
We should get rid of that word.

506
00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:34.196
Having said that,

507
00:20:35.956 --> 00:20:38.916
if an event happens just once,

508
00:20:40.266 --> 00:20:43.896
it may or may not have any significance or meaning,

509
00:20:43.896 --> 00:20:45.466
or replicability.

510
00:20:45.636 --> 00:20:48.956
But if it happens twice, and then it happens three times,

511
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.756
and then it happens four times,

512
00:20:50.756 --> 00:20:55.756
the more consistently it happens in a finite period of time,

513
00:20:57.036 --> 00:21:00.656
in multiple places, the more it, quote, "replicates,"

514
00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:03.436
the more, as a scientist, you come to the conclusion

515
00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:05.956
that there is a definable pattern here,

516
00:21:05.956 --> 00:21:10.336
and then we can look for what explains the origin

517
00:21:10.336 --> 00:21:12.816
and the potential meaning of that pattern.

518
00:21:12.816 --> 00:21:15.056
<v Woman>Yes. Okay so, we're going</v>

519
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:17.616
to move beyond the realm of,

520
00:21:17.616 --> 00:21:21.915
even if it's misstated, randomness and coincidence,

521
00:21:21.915 --> 00:21:23.495
and we're going to move into the realm now,

522
00:21:23.495 --> 00:21:28.495
of genuine synchronicity and how this magic unfolded

523
00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:31.595
in your life in quite an unexpected way

524
00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:34.415
through a member of the animal kingdom.

525
00:21:34.415 --> 00:21:37.295
Let's now tell the story of the raven.

526
00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:40.495
And because I don't know how much time we have on tape,

527
00:21:40.495 --> 00:21:42.795
we'll just kind of make it slightly condensed.

528
00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:44.335
Not too condensed, but just slightly.

529
00:21:44.335 --> 00:21:46.595
<v ->Okay, let me ask the question, do you want</v>

530
00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:49.015
a one minute version, the five minute version, the ten...

531
00:21:49.015 --> 00:21:50.575
<v Woman>Oh we'll take a 15 minute version.</v>

532
00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:53.415
<v ->Okay then we can do this properly.</v>

533
00:21:53.415 --> 00:21:56.465
<v Woman>Oh yes, we want to do that.</v>

534
00:21:57.715 --> 00:21:59.768
<v ->This particular synchronicity,</v>

535
00:21:59.768 --> 00:22:02.868
which involves a particular bird called a raven,

536
00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:06.168
was actually the third category of synchronicities

537
00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:08.008
that I had already charted.

538
00:22:08.008 --> 00:22:09.848
So the first one were elevens,

539
00:22:09.848 --> 00:22:12.148
and I wrote about the first set of those

540
00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:15.048
in Appendix C of The God Experiments book.

541
00:22:15.048 --> 00:22:17.668
The second had to do with dragonflies,

542
00:22:17.668 --> 00:22:19.108
which is another whole journey,

543
00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:22.448
and is part two of this new book that I'm writing.

544
00:22:22.448 --> 00:22:24.748
The third one has to do with ravens.

545
00:22:24.748 --> 00:22:26.688
So I already had one and two,

546
00:22:26.688 --> 00:22:29.848
which then prepared me to be open to three.

547
00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:34.108
So let's start with the idea that there's this person,

548
00:22:34.108 --> 00:22:36.808
who is me, who has been collecting this data

549
00:22:36.808 --> 00:22:39.408
which seems just impossible, but it's happening.

550
00:22:39.408 --> 00:22:42.248
As I think Sir William Crookes said,

551
00:22:42.248 --> 00:22:45.748
I didn't say it was possible, I said it happened.

552
00:22:46.548 --> 00:22:48.768
And here's the story.

553
00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:51.568
A little over two years ago,

554
00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:53.468
four women came to visit with me

555
00:22:53.468 --> 00:22:57.908
after the death of a very distinguished Harvard professor,

556
00:22:57.908 --> 00:22:59.968
also very controversial, by the name of John E. Mack.

557
00:22:59.968 --> 00:23:01.568
<v Woman>Yes, yeah, wonderful man.</v>

558
00:23:01.568 --> 00:23:02.608
<v ->And they wanted to talk about</v>

559
00:23:02.608 --> 00:23:04.708
doing some research in his honor.

560
00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:07.688
One of these women was a psychiatrist by the name of

561
00:23:07.688 --> 00:23:10.248
Dr. Diane Powell.

562
00:23:10.248 --> 00:23:13.168
And she's phenomenally trained.

563
00:23:13.168 --> 00:23:14.388
Has her M.D. from Johns Hopkins,

564
00:23:14.388 --> 00:23:15.968
she'd been an assistant professor at Harvard,

565
00:23:15.968 --> 00:23:18.728
she had been on the faculty at UC San Diego,

566
00:23:18.728 --> 00:23:20.148
she then went into private practice

567
00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:24.188
and ultimately divorced and went up into Ashland, Oregon

568
00:23:24.188 --> 00:23:27.348
and has a private practice, just completed a major book,

569
00:23:27.348 --> 00:23:30.808
and works part-time for the Institute of Noetic Sciences.

570
00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:31.848
Very distinguished woman.

571
00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:32.828
<v Woman>And she's very functional</v>

572
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:33.978
in the left side of the brain.

573
00:23:33.978 --> 00:23:36.228
<v ->She is very functional.</v>

574
00:23:36.228 --> 00:23:41.228
She is a remarkable and seemingly sane woman.

575
00:23:42.885 --> 00:23:45.385
I was so impressed with her, that I wanted

576
00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:46.485
to get to know her a little better,

577
00:23:46.485 --> 00:23:48.185
and I said could we have lunch together.

578
00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:49.665
So we did, we had lunch.

579
00:23:49.665 --> 00:23:53.905
And for 45 minutes, she starts telling me this story,

580
00:23:53.905 --> 00:23:56.085
which we could fill up our whole time with,

581
00:23:56.085 --> 00:23:59.805
about her experience with ravens

582
00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:03.685
and how these ravens were... she had noticed them

583
00:24:03.685 --> 00:24:04.945
when she was in San Diego,

584
00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:06.885
and they would perch on her window

585
00:24:06.885 --> 00:24:09.205
and sometimes make funny noises

586
00:24:09.205 --> 00:24:11.745
at meaningful moments in therapy

587
00:24:11.745 --> 00:24:14.765
and then they would squawk at her when she would walk around

588
00:24:14.765 --> 00:24:17.165
and she started getting interested in ravens

589
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:18.405
and what would ravens mean,

590
00:24:18.405 --> 00:24:20.025
and then she looked into her family history

591
00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.665
and it turned out that they were...

592
00:24:21.665 --> 00:24:24.305
The name Raven was connected to her past,

593
00:24:24.305 --> 00:24:26.205
anyway, it's a long journey.

594
00:24:26.205 --> 00:24:28.605
And I'm listening to this and I'm saying,

595
00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:31.805
why is this brilliant psychiatrist telling me this,

596
00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:36.515
technical scientific term, cockamamie story about ravens?

597
00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:40.745
So I'm stepping back and because this is an anomaly in life,

598
00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:42.145
no one ever had ever talked to me about ravens,

599
00:24:42.145 --> 00:24:44.625
and I didn't want to talk to her about ravens,

600
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:48.065
I started thinking, could this be meaningful?

601
00:24:48.065 --> 00:24:49.105
That's the first possibility.

602
00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:50.845
Is there something... is this the beginning

603
00:24:50.845 --> 00:24:52.865
of a synchronicity?

604
00:24:52.865 --> 00:24:56.605
And I began to realize that I collect Southwest

605
00:24:56.605 --> 00:24:58.525
and Pacific Northwest coast art.

606
00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:00.705
I've done so for over 30 years.

607
00:25:00.705 --> 00:25:02.305
And there's a lot of birds,

608
00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:04.805
and I know that I have some eagles,

609
00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:06.905
but I began to wonder whether I'd been collecting ravens

610
00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:08.925
and didn't know it.

611
00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:13.645
And so I said, would you mind quickly visiting my house?

612
00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:14.785
I collect Native American art,

613
00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:17.285
and I said, I'd like to know whether I had any ravens.

614
00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:19.185
So she comes over to my house and lo and behold,

615
00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:20.705
I discover that I have been living with ravens,

616
00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:22.165
collecting them, and didn't know it.

617
00:25:22.165 --> 00:25:24.165
I have this raven that's about one foot high,

618
00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:26.065
it's a man actually, a dancer,

619
00:25:26.065 --> 00:25:27.345
and he's wearing this long mask

620
00:25:27.345 --> 00:25:28.905
that turns out to be a raven mask.

621
00:25:28.905 --> 00:25:30.685
I have another carving that's about this big,

622
00:25:30.685 --> 00:25:32.105
I always thought it was a duck,

623
00:25:32.105 --> 00:25:33.465
it turns out to be a raven.

624
00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:37.345
There was a wall hanging, it's two feet by one foot carved,

625
00:25:37.345 --> 00:25:39.485
and it turns out to be a raven.

626
00:25:39.485 --> 00:25:42.635
<v Woman>You didn't study in zoology did you? (laughs)</v>

627
00:25:42.635 --> 00:25:45.334
<v ->No, I did take zoology, I took a year of zoology</v>

628
00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:47.914
and I properly forgot virtually everything I learned

629
00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:50.614
within ten or fifteen minutes after each exam.

630
00:25:50.614 --> 00:25:52.314
Because I don't remember things very well

631
00:25:52.314 --> 00:25:53.914
unless I'm going to be using them.

632
00:25:53.914 --> 00:25:56.714
Use them or lose them, I forget them.

633
00:25:56.714 --> 00:25:58.894
<v Woman>So continue on, so you kept seeing more and more</v>

634
00:25:58.894 --> 00:26:00.154
of these ravens...

635
00:26:00.154 --> 00:26:04.184
<v ->Yeah, so for example, I have two Kwakiutl ceremonial masks</v>

636
00:26:04.184 --> 00:26:05.452
one of them was an eagle, I knew it,

637
00:26:05.452 --> 00:26:07.452
the other was this funny little bird, it was a raven.

638
00:26:07.452 --> 00:26:09.312
Turns out that I had seven or eight ravens,

639
00:26:09.312 --> 00:26:10.672
I don't remember, at the time.

640
00:26:10.672 --> 00:26:12.732
I had been living with them.

641
00:26:12.732 --> 00:26:14.192
And I said, gee that's a little interesting,

642
00:26:14.192 --> 00:26:15.872
maybe I need to learn about ravens.

643
00:26:15.872 --> 00:26:18.112
So then I went to the internet and looked up ravens,

644
00:26:18.112 --> 00:26:20.132
and it turns out that I learned that ravens

645
00:26:20.132 --> 00:26:24.012
have this history in the Pacific Northwest coast lore

646
00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:25.292
in particular.

647
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:27.792
That they are messengers between the spirit world

648
00:26:27.792 --> 00:26:29.412
and the physical world.

649
00:26:29.412 --> 00:26:31.472
And also, there are these stories,

650
00:26:31.472 --> 00:26:35.612
where ravens were actually related to the great spirit,

651
00:26:35.612 --> 00:26:37.312
and it was the raven who actually came

652
00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:40.092
and brought light to humanity.

653
00:26:40.092 --> 00:26:41.852
So the raven is actually very much related

654
00:26:41.852 --> 00:26:46.772
to the manifesting, the reawakening, the creative process.

655
00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:48.312
So I'm saying this is very interesting.

656
00:26:48.312 --> 00:26:50.132
Two days later... it's just interesting.

657
00:26:50.132 --> 00:26:52.832
Two days later, a family that has been waiting

658
00:26:52.832 --> 00:26:56.732
to see me for months

659
00:26:56.732 --> 00:26:59.172
happens to have, through my administrative assistant,

660
00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:02.092
scheduled a dinner at what's called the Arizona Inn,

661
00:27:02.092 --> 00:27:06.512
a beautiful place in Tucson, very close to my laboratory.

662
00:27:08.082 --> 00:27:11.592
Their son had died. He was in his forties.

663
00:27:11.592 --> 00:27:13.992
He died under very tragic circumstances,

664
00:27:13.992 --> 00:27:15.232
and he loved animals.

665
00:27:15.232 --> 00:27:17.552
And his family had been wanting to see me,

666
00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.332
and they came with a photographic album

667
00:27:20.332 --> 00:27:22.252
because they wanted to get my opinion about this

668
00:27:22.252 --> 00:27:24.932
because they couldn't believe it.

669
00:27:24.932 --> 00:27:27.812
They tell me the story about how after their son died,

670
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:30.112
they have a home somewhere in the Midwest,

671
00:27:30.112 --> 00:27:31.992
and also in Tempe.

672
00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:33.152
And in their home in the Midwest,

673
00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:34.152
shortly after their son died,

674
00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:36.572
these ravens started coming onto their back porch,

675
00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:37.672
which they didn't do before,

676
00:27:37.672 --> 00:27:39.452
and there was one raven in particular, apparently,

677
00:27:39.452 --> 00:27:41.932
it was squawking, it wouldn't go away, so on and so forth.

678
00:27:41.932 --> 00:27:46.792
And then when they drove from this home to Tempe,

679
00:27:46.792 --> 00:27:50.192
they claim that this raven followed them.

680
00:27:50.192 --> 00:27:52.652
And then they claim that the raven was now in Tempe

681
00:27:52.652 --> 00:27:54.752
and it would sit in this tree over their house.

682
00:27:54.752 --> 00:27:56.932
She showed me pictures of this raven and so on,

683
00:27:56.932 --> 00:27:58.652
and then there was one picture that was sort of fuzzy

684
00:27:58.652 --> 00:28:01.172
that she said looked like the face of her son

685
00:28:01.172 --> 00:28:02.692
near the raven.

686
00:28:02.692 --> 00:28:04.672
Now normally if I had heard a story like this,

687
00:28:04.672 --> 00:28:07.892
I would have thought these people were crazy.

688
00:28:07.892 --> 00:28:09.491
But because I had just had a psychiatrist

689
00:28:09.491 --> 00:28:11.091
do something weird telling me about all these

690
00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:13.571
raven synchronicities, which sounded empirically like

691
00:28:13.571 --> 00:28:14.831
I couldn't dismiss them.

692
00:28:14.831 --> 00:28:16.651
I'm then living with a whole bunch of ravens

693
00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:17.491
and didn't even know it.

694
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:18.751
<v Woman>Yeah, loads of raven roommates.</v>

695
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:23.571
<v ->Right. (laughs) Raven roommates. Thank you.</v>

696
00:28:23.571 --> 00:28:24.311
<v Woman>You're welcome.</v>

697
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:26.491
<v ->That's a take home message for me from this interview.</v>

698
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:28.421
That's great.

699
00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:31.831
And now this family's here.

700
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:35.591
I'm saying to myself, should I be taking this seriously?

701
00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:36.811
So I learned more about ravens.

702
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:38.191
I learned they're really smart.

703
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:40.851
I learned, for example, that they can learn to speak

704
00:28:40.851 --> 00:28:44.671
equal, if not better than the African Gray Parrot.

705
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:46.551
I also learn that I've been reading about

706
00:28:46.551 --> 00:28:49.111
Rupert Sheldrake's work and his claims that

707
00:28:49.111 --> 00:28:50.971
parrots could read the minds of humans

708
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:52.771
and there are these telepathy experiments,

709
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:56.951
and I begin to wonder, is it possible

710
00:28:56.951 --> 00:29:00.191
that ravens could be taught to speak,

711
00:29:00.191 --> 00:29:02.271
and since they're so connected to the spirit world,

712
00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:04.571
maybe they could serve like mediums.

713
00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:05.591
<v Woman>Well since you've done all these</v>

714
00:29:05.591 --> 00:29:08.671
medium experiments with Allison DuBois and many others...

715
00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:11.331
<v ->Exactly, and there's always a criticism that</v>

716
00:29:11.331 --> 00:29:12.411
the mediums are doing it for money...

717
00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:13.451
<v Woman>And they're not temperamental.</v>

718
00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:14.871
<v ->and the fraud, and everything else.</v>

719
00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:16.591
This would make it so much easier.

720
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:20.851
You keep them in a cage, you don't have to pay them so much,

721
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.731
I mean they're just... You don't have to deal with them

722
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:23.831
being on television, I mean,

723
00:29:23.831 --> 00:29:25.811
there's really a lot of advantages.

724
00:29:26.629 --> 00:29:27.589
<v Woman>Practical.</v>

725
00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:30.049
<v ->Practical. So I was just fantasizing about this</v>

726
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:32.809
and wondering what it would be like to have a pet raven.

727
00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:34.849
Would it be even possible to do this?

728
00:29:34.849 --> 00:29:37.209
Well it just so happened that a few weeks later

729
00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:38.449
I was to come to Santa Fe,

730
00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:40.649
which is where this interview is taking place,

731
00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:42.469
to speak at a conference on science and consciousness,

732
00:29:42.469 --> 00:29:46.289
where I was talking about life after death,

733
00:29:46.289 --> 00:29:48.349
the afterlife experiments.

734
00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:50.229
And I'm in Santa Fe, and I discover

735
00:29:50.229 --> 00:29:51.829
there are a lot of ravens in Santa Fe,

736
00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:53.289
of course I didn't know this.

737
00:29:53.289 --> 00:29:55.889
And I'm taking a walk just past the square,

738
00:29:55.889 --> 00:29:57.609
and there is this particular gallery,

739
00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:59.129
and on this gallery there outside

740
00:29:59.129 --> 00:30:01.529
there is this wooden bench.

741
00:30:01.529 --> 00:30:03.849
And there's this raven, this gigantic raven,

742
00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:05.069
sitting on this bench.

743
00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:05.809
I couldn't believe it.

744
00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:08.189
I'm walking up to this raven, it's not going away,

745
00:30:08.189 --> 00:30:09.829
and then I notice it's not moving.

746
00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:11.429
Turns out it's a statue.

747
00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:12.929
A statue by a man by the name of,

748
00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:14.849
I subsequently learned, of Jim Eppler.

749
00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:15.989
And he makes raven statues,

750
00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:18.089
gigantic, beautiful raven statues.

751
00:30:18.089 --> 00:30:19.769
And I'm saying, oh my god, here's a raven statue,

752
00:30:19.769 --> 00:30:21.529
how often do you bump into a raven statue

753
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:23.009
sitting on a bench, so I sat on the bench

754
00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:23.809
and I played with it.

755
00:30:23.809 --> 00:30:25.849
I went in the store and started looking at their ravens.

756
00:30:25.849 --> 00:30:29.469
And this woman, Dr. Diane Powell,

757
00:30:29.469 --> 00:30:31.249
she had also come to this meeting,

758
00:30:31.249 --> 00:30:33.569
so I invited her to come over to see this raven,

759
00:30:33.569 --> 00:30:34.829
because she's the person who introduced me

760
00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:36.509
to the raven process.

761
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:40.109
And I took a picture of her with her petting the raven.

762
00:30:40.109 --> 00:30:43.209
It's the morning that I'm now to give my talk,

763
00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:46.709
and in the shower it occurs to me,

764
00:30:46.709 --> 00:30:48.569
I wonder whether I should end my talk

765
00:30:48.569 --> 00:30:50.249
with the story about ravens.

766
00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:52.969
Now I often tell the story that comes from William James,

767
00:30:52.969 --> 00:30:54.049
he has this quote which says,

768
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:56.109
"In order to disprove the law that all crows are black,

769
00:30:56.109 --> 00:30:59.209
"you need only find one white crow."

770
00:30:59.209 --> 00:31:00.789
I said, well gee, what would happen

771
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:02.009
if it was changed slightly?

772
00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:04.049
In order to disprove the law that all ravens are black

773
00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:05.629
all you need is one white raven.

774
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:07.309
I wonder if there are any white ravens?

775
00:31:07.309 --> 00:31:08.729
So I went on the internet and looked up,

776
00:31:08.729 --> 00:31:10.829
it turns out there are all kind of mystical stories

777
00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:13.889
about white ravens and albino ravens and so on.

778
00:31:13.889 --> 00:31:17.029
I said, okay, I'm going to end this talk

779
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:20.989
with a slide called "The Journey Continues".

780
00:31:20.989 --> 00:31:23.689
I would show the picture of Diane petting the raven,

781
00:31:23.689 --> 00:31:27.389
because I'm in Santa Fe, and I would raise the question

782
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:28.949
about animals communicating

783
00:31:28.949 --> 00:31:31.749
and spirit communicating through animals

784
00:31:31.749 --> 00:31:32.909
and the connection between animals

785
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:36.189
and is this just mythology or is this more?

786
00:31:36.189 --> 00:31:39.269
Well after I showed this slide,

787
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:41.269
the audience was just phenomenal,

788
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:43.549
and I start hearing people telling me raven stories.

789
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:47.229
This opened this whole slew of now people telling me

790
00:31:47.229 --> 00:31:48.889
about their raven experiences.

791
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:50.669
<v Woman>I told you mine yesterday, in fact.</v>

792
00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:52.979
It seems rather common.

793
00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:56.048
<v ->Yes, in fact, I've now actually decided to do a book</v>

794
00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:58.488
about raven stories and people telling their raven stories

795
00:31:58.488 --> 00:31:59.748
because it's so much fun.

796
00:31:59.748 --> 00:32:03.648
Anyway, I'm now leaving for Turkey.

797
00:32:03.648 --> 00:32:06.748
This is where it starts getting weird.

798
00:32:06.748 --> 00:32:08.228
Because up to now, this is just,

799
00:32:08.228 --> 00:32:10.988
it's interesting but so what?

800
00:32:10.988 --> 00:32:13.228
I don't know what it means.

801
00:32:13.228 --> 00:32:16.068
I'm at the Tucson airport, and I stop,

802
00:32:16.068 --> 00:32:18.488
and as I like to do when I fly,

803
00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:19.768
particularly long trips,

804
00:32:19.768 --> 00:32:22.528
whatever paperback or hardcover happens

805
00:32:22.528 --> 00:32:26.088
to be available that has something to do with a mystery

806
00:32:26.088 --> 00:32:27.648
I'll buy it.

807
00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:29.588
And there was this one particular mystery

808
00:32:29.588 --> 00:32:32.048
by these two authors which I had never read before,

809
00:32:32.048 --> 00:32:35.288
but it had to do with an FBI agent and a policeman

810
00:32:35.288 --> 00:32:36.768
and they were going to solve some crimes.

811
00:32:36.768 --> 00:32:38.648
And I said I'll buy it, and I'll read it

812
00:32:38.648 --> 00:32:41.248
coming back from Turkey, it's a long flight.

813
00:32:41.248 --> 00:32:43.348
So I just put it away.

814
00:32:43.348 --> 00:32:48.348
I get to Turkey, and I start wondering,

815
00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:50.228
I'm about to prepare my talk,

816
00:32:50.228 --> 00:32:54.528
should I end it with this raven slide?

817
00:32:54.528 --> 00:32:56.748
Because people were really interested in this.

818
00:32:56.748 --> 00:32:58.978
But then I said to myself,

819
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:01.107
does Turkey have any connection to ravens?

820
00:33:01.107 --> 00:33:03.547
I don't mean the bird to the bird, I mean the country.

821
00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:04.947
This occurred to me in the shower,

822
00:33:04.947 --> 00:33:06.507
so I got out of the shower and I typed in

823
00:33:06.507 --> 00:33:09.307
"Turkey country raven," because if I typed in

824
00:33:09.307 --> 00:33:11.527
turkey and raven, I'd get two birds.

825
00:33:11.527 --> 00:33:13.327
I discovered on the internet,

826
00:33:13.327 --> 00:33:16.507
that Turkey actually has phrases,

827
00:33:16.507 --> 00:33:19.627
national phrases, related to the raven.

828
00:33:19.627 --> 00:33:21.827
And one of these phrases was,

829
00:33:21.827 --> 00:33:26.827
turkeys see their chicks... turkeys see chicks as raisins...

830
00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:31.197
It said, no, they said...

831
00:33:31.197 --> 00:33:35.366
Ravens see chicks as falcons.

832
00:33:35.366 --> 00:33:37.966
Ravens see chicks as falcons, what does that mean?

833
00:33:37.966 --> 00:33:40.026
I don't know, but at least it's a saying.

834
00:33:40.026 --> 00:33:43.806
So I said, I'm going to share this at the end of the talk.

835
00:33:43.806 --> 00:33:45.506
Well my talk was sort of late in the afternoon

836
00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:46.546
at their convention center.

837
00:33:46.546 --> 00:33:47.986
It was a very big conference.

838
00:33:47.986 --> 00:33:50.046
It was featured in their newspapers and so on.

839
00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:52.566
And I ended the talk with this slide

840
00:33:52.566 --> 00:33:56.726
of Diane petting this statue of the raven,

841
00:33:56.726 --> 00:34:00.866
and afterwards, people come up to me

842
00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:03.786
and they start telling me raven stories.

843
00:34:03.786 --> 00:34:05.295
Now, we're now going to have dinner.

844
00:34:05.295 --> 00:34:06.995
This is where it now gets weird.

845
00:34:06.995 --> 00:34:10.495
We're about to have dinner, about 25 people,

846
00:34:10.495 --> 00:34:12.115
at the hotel, fancy dinner.

847
00:34:12.115 --> 00:34:15.075
We're around this long, square table, no seating assignment.

848
00:34:15.075 --> 00:34:17.515
I end up having to sit in the corner.

849
00:34:17.515 --> 00:34:19.315
This woman sits next to me who turns out to be

850
00:34:19.315 --> 00:34:20.695
the executive director of the foundation

851
00:34:20.695 --> 00:34:21.635
who invited us there,

852
00:34:21.635 --> 00:34:24.795
and next to him sits Dr. Konstantin Korotkov,

853
00:34:24.795 --> 00:34:27.095
a Russian physicist from St. Petersburg,

854
00:34:27.095 --> 00:34:30.415
wonderful man, who I've known for the past few years.

855
00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:31.814
And he has this wonderful Russian accent,

856
00:34:31.814 --> 00:34:33.914
and I do it very badly, but I have to still at least honor

857
00:34:33.914 --> 00:34:35.294
the Russian accent.

858
00:34:35.294 --> 00:34:36.874
He had just flown in from St. Petersburg

859
00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:37.874
and heard my talk and he says,

860
00:34:37.874 --> 00:34:40.354
oh, he says, Gary it's wonderful to see you,

861
00:34:40.354 --> 00:34:42.354
it was great presentation, he says.

862
00:34:42.354 --> 00:34:45.764
I especially like the part about the raven.

863
00:34:46.414 --> 00:34:48.173
I said, you liked the part about the raven?

864
00:34:48.173 --> 00:34:49.613
He says, oh yes, very much so.

865
00:34:49.613 --> 00:34:50.933
I said, why? And he says,

866
00:34:50.933 --> 00:34:54.453
I really love ravens, in fact when I was in graduate school,

867
00:34:54.453 --> 00:34:56.363
I had a pet raven.

868
00:34:56.753 --> 00:34:58.773
I said, you had a pet raven?

869
00:34:58.773 --> 00:34:59.713
<v Woman>I wish I had known this</v>

870
00:34:59.713 --> 00:35:01.593
before we interviewed him a couple days ago,

871
00:35:01.593 --> 00:35:04.053
I would've asked him about it. (laughs)

872
00:35:04.053 --> 00:35:06.233
<v ->(laughs) I said, you have a pet raven?</v>

873
00:35:06.233 --> 00:35:08.793
I'd never met anyone who had a pet raven.

874
00:35:08.793 --> 00:35:10.553
I said, you gotta tell me the story.

875
00:35:10.553 --> 00:35:12.773
So he goes and tells me this long story about his pet raven

876
00:35:12.773 --> 00:35:14.253
which we don't have time for.

877
00:35:14.253 --> 00:35:15.773
And now I'm sort of in shock.

878
00:35:15.773 --> 00:35:17.173
And then he says, hey, you wanna hear

879
00:35:17.173 --> 00:35:18.953
some Russian raven jokes?

880
00:35:18.953 --> 00:35:19.881
<v Woman>(laughs)</v>

881
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:21.241
<v ->I said, Russian raven jokes?</v>

882
00:35:21.241 --> 00:35:23.021
He's like, yeah, Russians we have lots of jokes,

883
00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:24.821
including about ravens.

884
00:35:24.821 --> 00:35:25.881
I said, well sure.

885
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:27.581
So he starts telling me these jokes.

886
00:35:27.581 --> 00:35:28.981
Now at this point, you have to understand,

887
00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:30.801
the whole table is silent,

888
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:32.481
because they're now listening to the two of us

889
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.701
as I'm going, what?

890
00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:35.421
And he's making these very funny jokes,

891
00:35:35.421 --> 00:35:37.941
which again, I don't remember.

892
00:35:37.941 --> 00:35:39.581
And so after, there were people from Sweden,

893
00:35:39.581 --> 00:35:41.301
and from England, and from America,

894
00:35:41.301 --> 00:35:42.641
and from Italy and so on.

895
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:43.841
So I went around the table and I said,

896
00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.221
how many of you from other countries,

897
00:35:45.221 --> 00:35:47.061
do your countries have raven jokes?

898
00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:48.481
Nobody.

899
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.461
I said, but my understanding is that in Turkey,

900
00:35:51.461 --> 00:35:53.301
you have sayings about ravens.

901
00:35:53.301 --> 00:35:55.061
So the Turks said, oh yes.

902
00:35:55.061 --> 00:35:58.071
I said, do you know what this phrase means?

903
00:35:58.071 --> 00:36:00.780
Ravens see chicks as falcons.

904
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.660
The woman sitting next to me, she says,

905
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.970
oh yes, but they didn't get the translation quite right.

906
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.400
The saying is, "Ravens see their chicks as falcons."

907
00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.300
All of a sudden it hit me.

908
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.440
Because I don't know whether you've

909
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.140
ever seen a baby raven chick...

910
00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.620
<v Woman>Never have.</v>

911
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.200
<v ->I hadn't either, so I went on the internet and looked.</v>

912
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.500
They are really ugly.

913
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.880
They look like little tarantulas.

914
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.380
They don't look cute through most people's standards.

915
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.740
<v Woman>They don't look like falcons.</v>

916
00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.240
<v ->No, they don't look at all like that.</v>

917
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.520
But apparently, the raven mother sees this little infant,

918
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.780
she sees its potential and also sees its glory,

919
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.420
as to be able to be like a falcon.

920
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.800
And that's a deeply spiritual significance,

921
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.480
being able to see the potential beauty, and greatness,

922
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.060
and wonder in something which may look like

923
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.020
a rough cut diamond, for example.

924
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.110
So I said, oh, I've got it.

925
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.880
So I left that dinner, now in awe.

926
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.820
The next morning, I get to the conference,

927
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.840
and this woman who had been sitting next to me,

928
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.300
she says, Dr. Schwartz, I've written something

929
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.100
that's very important. Please read it.

930
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.040
She hands it to me.

931
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.540
I said thank you, put it in my pocket,

932
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.820
and I promptly forget it.

933
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.980
I'm at the conference, all these people,

934
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.780
they're telling me raven stories and stuff.

935
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.300
Well it's lunchtime, I'm late,

936
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.109
the whole group is then sequestered.

937
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:21.629
It happens again being a square table, different restaurant.

938
00:37:21.629 --> 00:37:23.909
I get there late, turns out she gets there late.

939
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:26.569
We're now sitting next to each other.

940
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:28.409
She said did you read the paper?

941
00:37:28.409 --> 00:37:29.969
I said no.

942
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:33.989
She said please do, so I take the paper out,

943
00:37:33.989 --> 00:37:36.838
and she says, Dr. Schwartz you're not gonna believe this,

944
00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:38.198
and by the way, I couldn't believe it.

945
00:37:38.198 --> 00:37:41.398
She said, I was driving back to my province last night,

946
00:37:41.398 --> 00:37:42.758
which is like (speaks foreign language)

947
00:37:42.758 --> 00:37:45.518
I can't pronounce Turkish, it's of course written down.

948
00:37:45.518 --> 00:37:47.658
And she says, I'm going into my town called

949
00:37:47.658 --> 00:37:49.298
(speaks foreign language) or whatever.

950
00:37:49.298 --> 00:37:51.598
<v Woman>(laughs) That'll do.</v>

951
00:37:51.598 --> 00:37:53.467
<v ->And she said, I realized that the town had a name,</v>

952
00:37:53.467 --> 00:37:55.027
and I went and looked it up,

953
00:37:55.027 --> 00:37:58.747
and the town that I live in is named "Baby Raven"

954
00:37:58.747 --> 00:38:00.507
or "Raven Chick."

955
00:38:00.507 --> 00:38:02.587
So the woman that I'm sitting next to

956
00:38:02.587 --> 00:38:04.147
who was between me and Konstantin,

957
00:38:04.147 --> 00:38:06.407
who explained to me the meaning of the phrase

958
00:38:06.407 --> 00:38:09.447
lives in a town called "Raven Chick."

959
00:38:09.447 --> 00:38:10.527
<v Woman>Isn't that amazing.</v>

960
00:38:10.527 --> 00:38:11.927
<v ->At this point it's now too much.</v>

961
00:38:11.927 --> 00:38:12.887
<v Woman>Right.</v>

962
00:38:12.887 --> 00:38:13.707
<v ->I say...</v>

963
00:38:13.707 --> 00:38:15.407
<v Woman>You've been batted on the head a few times now.</v>

964
00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:16.547
<v ->I've now been hit a lot now.</v>

965
00:38:16.547 --> 00:38:17.867
See this is a lot of data.

966
00:38:17.867 --> 00:38:18.947
<v Woman>Lots of lumps on your head.</v>

967
00:38:18.947 --> 00:38:20.747
<v ->A lot of lumps on my head, indeed.</v>

968
00:38:20.747 --> 00:38:23.887
I said, okay universe, enough.

969
00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:25.167
I need a break.

970
00:38:25.167 --> 00:38:26.507
I don't know what's going on,

971
00:38:26.507 --> 00:38:31.087
but this is... I'm going back, I'm tired.

972
00:38:31.087 --> 00:38:33.047
I'm just going to read my novel.

973
00:38:33.047 --> 00:38:36.127
So I pull out this novel, and I start reading,

974
00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:39.527
and it has to do with this FBI agent,

975
00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:42.807
very wealthy, but he's concerned with

976
00:38:42.807 --> 00:38:45.247
righteousness and goodness and so on, he's very gifted.

977
00:38:45.247 --> 00:38:48.897
And this policeman, New York policeman.

978
00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:50.947
And early on in the book, he talks about how

979
00:38:50.947 --> 00:38:52.447
when he gets confused, he doesn't have the answer

980
00:38:52.447 --> 00:38:55.147
to a question, he'll go out to his Great Aunt's estate,

981
00:38:55.147 --> 00:38:56.427
again I have all this written down,

982
00:38:56.427 --> 00:38:58.127
because if you don't chronicle this,

983
00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:59.187
you're going to forget it,

984
00:38:59.187 --> 00:39:01.047
so it's very important that you keep

985
00:39:01.047 --> 00:39:03.617
very deep, clear records.

986
00:39:07.817 --> 00:39:10.947
They get to the estate, and the estate was called

987
00:39:10.947 --> 00:39:14.767
something like, Raven's Cry, or Raven's Nest.

988
00:39:14.767 --> 00:39:17.757
It was Raven's something.

989
00:39:18.557 --> 00:39:21.926
I have read hundreds and hundreds of mysteries,

990
00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:24.906
and the average, it was weird.

991
00:39:24.906 --> 00:39:27.086
I said well, that's just one raven.

992
00:39:27.086 --> 00:39:29.826
I go along further in the book,

993
00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:31.565
and about midway through, they're very hungry

994
00:39:31.565 --> 00:39:32.645
and they're in France or something,

995
00:39:32.645 --> 00:39:34.465
it's not important right now.

996
00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:38.085
And they talk about how they were "ravenously hungry."

997
00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:39.905
That's ravenously.

998
00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:41.245
Now again, ravenously hungry,

999
00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:42.945
ravenous is a fairly common word,

1000
00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:46.025
but it's not used in the average mystery,

1001
00:39:46.025 --> 00:39:46.865
and I noticed that.

1002
00:39:46.865 --> 00:39:48.645
I said, that's two ravens.

1003
00:39:48.645 --> 00:39:51.125
Then they go further along and now they're in Italy,

1004
00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:52.865
and they're being chased by these dogs,

1005
00:39:52.865 --> 00:39:54.785
these bad guys are after them and so on.

1006
00:39:54.785 --> 00:39:58.085
And the authors write that the barking of the dogs

1007
00:39:58.085 --> 00:40:01.025
sounded like cries of ravens.

1008
00:40:01.025 --> 00:40:04.865
How many authors describe dogs barking

1009
00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:06.965
as cries of ravens?
<v Woman>Exactly.</v>

1010
00:40:06.965 --> 00:40:10.585
<v ->Now we've got three in this one book.</v>

1011
00:40:10.585 --> 00:40:15.585
And I said, if there's any more, I'm in trouble.

1012
00:40:16.145 --> 00:40:20.045
The last chapter of the book, the policeman is looking

1013
00:40:20.045 --> 00:40:21.285
out into a field.

1014
00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:22.605
The FBI agent is missing,

1015
00:40:22.605 --> 00:40:23.785
they don't know if he's killed or not.

1016
00:40:23.785 --> 00:40:26.225
That will be told in the next book.

1017
00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:28.685
He's very forlorn, and he looks out over the field,

1018
00:40:28.685 --> 00:40:31.705
the authors write, and out on the field

1019
00:40:31.705 --> 00:40:34.654
is a lone, black raven.

1020
00:40:34.654 --> 00:40:36.714
At that point, I knew that these authors,

1021
00:40:36.714 --> 00:40:40.574
Preston and Child, they obviously have a thing about ravens,

1022
00:40:40.574 --> 00:40:43.414
otherwise they wouldn't have all these ravens in there.

1023
00:40:43.414 --> 00:40:46.114
And I'm saying to myself, what's the probability

1024
00:40:46.114 --> 00:40:50.734
that I would read a book and then save a book

1025
00:40:50.734 --> 00:40:55.734
and be reading this story, and that after I've had these

1026
00:40:56.294 --> 00:40:59.994
completely, if you add them all up,

1027
00:40:59.994 --> 00:41:02.054
within a very short period of time,

1028
00:41:02.054 --> 00:41:05.014
set of synchronicities about ravens?

1029
00:41:05.014 --> 00:41:08.854
How do we explain this?

1030
00:41:08.854 --> 00:41:11.254
And here's not the way to explain it.

1031
00:41:11.254 --> 00:41:13.734
It is true that if we start saying,

1032
00:41:13.734 --> 00:41:16.434
gee, I wonder if there's any connection to me

1033
00:41:16.434 --> 00:41:21.074
between myself and VW Bugs.

1034
00:41:21.074 --> 00:41:24.194
Well if you start looking for VW Bugs,

1035
00:41:24.194 --> 00:41:25.374
you're gonna find them,

1036
00:41:25.374 --> 00:41:27.854
because people drive these cars and they're around.

1037
00:41:27.854 --> 00:41:31.134
We don't notice them, but they've always been there

1038
00:41:31.134 --> 00:41:33.174
and we'll start noticing them,

1039
00:41:33.174 --> 00:41:34.954
and we can start collecting them.

1040
00:41:34.954 --> 00:41:38.754
But that doesn't mean that it's a synchronicity between

1041
00:41:38.754 --> 00:41:41.954
just because you notice them and their presence.

1042
00:41:41.954 --> 00:41:43.914
In order for it to be a synchronicity,

1043
00:41:43.914 --> 00:41:46.494
the event must be uncommon,

1044
00:41:46.494 --> 00:41:49.034
it must be tightly coupled in timing,

1045
00:41:49.034 --> 00:41:51.734
and they should be personally meaningful

1046
00:41:51.734 --> 00:41:53.914
to you in your life.

1047
00:41:53.914 --> 00:41:55.834
And when those set of things happen

1048
00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:57.834
and they happen repeatedly,

1049
00:41:57.834 --> 00:42:00.794
at this point your flag should go up,

1050
00:42:00.794 --> 00:42:02.714
and you should start saying okay,

1051
00:42:02.714 --> 00:42:07.714
what is this telling us about our life and the universe?

1052
00:42:08.694 --> 00:42:11.294
And the raven synchronicity has continued to this day.

1053
00:42:11.294 --> 00:42:12.652
If I could just share one little thing,

1054
00:42:12.652 --> 00:42:13.812
I get to this conference,

1055
00:42:13.812 --> 00:42:15.472
and now I've had so many raven synchronicities

1056
00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:17.912
that they're beyond beyond.

1057
00:42:19.112 --> 00:42:24.032
And it's now two years later, and I'm committed,

1058
00:42:24.032 --> 00:42:26.412
because Konstantin Korotkov is going to be here,

1059
00:42:26.412 --> 00:42:27.832
and I'm now writing this book.

1060
00:42:27.832 --> 00:42:32.052
I want to interview him and get these stories

1061
00:42:32.052 --> 00:42:35.512
of the raven jokes and his memory of what happened

1062
00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:37.812
at this conference as best as he can remember it,

1063
00:42:37.812 --> 00:42:40.742
so at least I'm citing his memory correctly.

1064
00:42:41.752 --> 00:42:45.901
So I said okay, when I just arrived at the hotel,

1065
00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:47.860
and I was looking forward to meeting him,

1066
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.540
and who do I literally bump into,

1067
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.600
I mean literally within a minute,

1068
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.020
but Konstantin.

1069
00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.220
And before I get a chance...

1070
00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.780
You know, we hug each other and so on.

1071
00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.360
Before I get a chance to tell him

1072
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.160
that I want to interview him about this thing, he says,

1073
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.100
Gary, I'm glad to see you,

1074
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.020
and he says, I have a surprise for you.

1075
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.060
He says, you must come to my room right now,

1076
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.540
we're gonna drink some wine.

1077
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.600
I've got a bottle of Ravenswood wine.

1078
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.530
<v Woman>(laughs)</v>

1079
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.810
<v ->Because he obviously now remembers the connection.</v>

1080
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.280
And so I say to myself, that's nice.

1081
00:43:22.819 --> 00:43:26.039
And again, it was the timing of all of this.

1082
00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:27.299
So again, we had...

1083
00:43:27.299 --> 00:43:29.339
It turns out it wasn't just me there,

1084
00:43:29.339 --> 00:43:31.679
but there were other people so we were actually...

1085
00:43:31.679 --> 00:43:33.519
Lots of people were able to hear this

1086
00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:35.199
and then the conversation went into other areas

1087
00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:36.359
that turned out to be very meaningful,

1088
00:43:36.359 --> 00:43:39.619
but I had all this down, and then I told him,

1089
00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:43.799
because he had not heard the post-Konstantin story.

1090
00:43:43.799 --> 00:43:45.759
He hadn't heard about the piece of paper

1091
00:43:45.759 --> 00:43:47.819
with the Raven's Chick town,

1092
00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:50.269
and he hadn't heard about this book.

1093
00:43:50.269 --> 00:43:52.228
And he didn't know that I was now on a quest,

1094
00:43:52.228 --> 00:43:56.108
that I now even have a ring that has a raven on it,

1095
00:43:56.108 --> 00:44:01.108
so that I carry this as a reminder of this specialness.

1096
00:44:01.828 --> 00:44:05.758
Well I leave that meeting and then I go into the...

1097
00:44:07.488 --> 00:44:08.968
What do you call those?

1098
00:44:08.968 --> 00:44:10.668
<v Woman>Concession?</v>

1099
00:44:10.668 --> 00:44:12.188
<v ->What is it, concession or coffee shop,</v>

1100
00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:14.708
not coffee shop, but where they sell

1101
00:44:14.708 --> 00:44:16.507
books and postcards and...

1102
00:44:16.507 --> 00:44:19.867
<v Woman>Yeah the little lobby gift shop.</v>

1103
00:44:19.867 --> 00:44:22.087
<v ->Gift shop. I go to the gift shop.</v>

1104
00:44:22.087 --> 00:44:23.107
There's a book set.

1105
00:44:23.107 --> 00:44:27.967
And on this set of books, is a paperback novel

1106
00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:29.387
by these two authors.

1107
00:44:29.387 --> 00:44:32.447
One that had been written ten years ago.

1108
00:44:32.447 --> 00:44:34.467
One that I had wanted to read,

1109
00:44:34.467 --> 00:44:35.927
but you don't typically find it.

1110
00:44:35.927 --> 00:44:38.067
It's not a very popular book.

1111
00:44:38.067 --> 00:44:39.667
But it was in this bookstore.

1112
00:44:39.667 --> 00:44:41.267
I said fantastic,

1113
00:44:41.267 --> 00:44:44.267
I wonder if there's going to be any ravens in this book.

1114
00:44:44.267 --> 00:44:45.307
I buy the book.

1115
00:44:45.307 --> 00:44:46.787
It turns out the reason why it's in this book

1116
00:44:46.787 --> 00:44:48.487
is because this particular story

1117
00:44:48.487 --> 00:44:52.167
takes place in New Mexico and involves Santa Fe and so on.

1118
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:56.487
And so I buy this book and I said

1119
00:44:56.487 --> 00:45:00.537
wouldn't it be fun if the ravens continued.

1120
00:45:00.647 --> 00:45:01.627
I get the book, I go up to the room,

1121
00:45:01.627 --> 00:45:04.457
I have to quickly look just to see,

1122
00:45:04.457 --> 00:45:05.867
and I start reading the introduction.

1123
00:45:05.867 --> 00:45:09.827
The second line of the introduction talks about some sound

1124
00:45:09.827 --> 00:45:11.027
that they were hearing.

1125
00:45:11.027 --> 00:45:14.897
And they describe it as the cries of ravens.

1126
00:45:15.867 --> 00:45:18.187
<v Woman>Okay, here we, and there... Yes.</v>

1127
00:45:18.187 --> 00:45:19.427
And it continues.

1128
00:45:19.427 --> 00:45:20.647
<v ->It continues.</v>

1129
00:45:20.647 --> 00:45:23.527
<v Woman>And what's so marvelous about this is</v>

1130
00:45:23.527 --> 00:45:27.627
how you can see the excitement, I can see the excitement

1131
00:45:27.627 --> 00:45:29.807
over the magic of it in you.

1132
00:45:29.807 --> 00:45:33.087
And how is this actually transforming the way

1133
00:45:33.087 --> 00:45:36.577
you're viewing the life experience?

1134
00:45:37.427 --> 00:45:39.687
<v ->Well imagine for the moment,</v>

1135
00:45:39.687 --> 00:45:44.687
that all of us are part of a web of interconnection

1136
00:45:45.307 --> 00:45:48.767
for which there is some sort of a G.O.D. process

1137
00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:52.167
much more sophisticated than we've ever thought about.

1138
00:45:52.167 --> 00:45:54.717
I like to think of it, for example, as infinite intelligence

1139
00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:57.246
and if you really ponder what it means to have

1140
00:45:57.246 --> 00:45:59.486
an infinite level of intelligence,

1141
00:45:59.486 --> 00:46:00.726
an intelligence that could be so great

1142
00:46:00.726 --> 00:46:03.526
that it could even invent infinity.

1143
00:46:03.526 --> 00:46:05.806
It goes beyond anything that we can imagine.

1144
00:46:05.806 --> 00:46:09.526
But if you try to just live with that possibility,

1145
00:46:09.526 --> 00:46:11.686
just for the second, and then also recognize

1146
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:14.926
that, so to speak, it can be in everything,

1147
00:46:14.926 --> 00:46:17.266
i.e., the all can be in the small,

1148
00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:18.526
and by the way, the word small

1149
00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:19.846
literally has the word all in it,

1150
00:46:19.846 --> 00:46:22.346
which is a very convenient way to remember this.

1151
00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:24.126
Then what happens is...

1152
00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:27.026
And then you combine this with systems thinking,

1153
00:46:27.026 --> 00:46:29.386
which is the idea that something

1154
00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:31.966
that's a part of something larger has feedback,

1155
00:46:31.966 --> 00:46:34.726
that the subsystem can be in contact with the system,

1156
00:46:34.726 --> 00:46:37.286
that the system can be in communication

1157
00:46:37.286 --> 00:46:38.706
with the super system,

1158
00:46:38.706 --> 00:46:41.126
you then recognize that if the all's in the small

1159
00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:42.386
and we're all part of this,

1160
00:46:42.386 --> 00:46:44.886
that we are then receiving communication

1161
00:46:44.886 --> 00:46:46.866
and then can be processing this,

1162
00:46:46.866 --> 00:46:51.536
and therefore, we can start asking even questions of it.

1163
00:46:51.866 --> 00:46:54.126
And then engage in a dialog,

1164
00:46:54.126 --> 00:46:56.526
or become a participant of the process,

1165
00:46:56.526 --> 00:46:59.406
a more mindful, conscious participant of the process.

1166
00:46:59.406 --> 00:47:01.526
And so what happens if we start living our lives

1167
00:47:01.526 --> 00:47:04.106
and we recognize that it's so complicated

1168
00:47:04.106 --> 00:47:07.046
that we're going to have to raise our intelligence

1169
00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:09.776
to see this intelligence.

1170
00:47:10.466 --> 00:47:13.266
And you do it with great humility and great openness.

1171
00:47:13.266 --> 00:47:15.386
You have to not reject and dismiss,

1172
00:47:15.386 --> 00:47:17.706
and at the same time you just don't want to

1173
00:47:17.706 --> 00:47:20.686
quote, "randomly" or sporadically pull things together

1174
00:47:20.686 --> 00:47:22.666
and build stories where they're not there.

1175
00:47:22.666 --> 00:47:24.646
So you have to do it with discernment.

1176
00:47:24.646 --> 00:47:27.106
When you do that, my experience has been,

1177
00:47:27.106 --> 00:47:29.926
over these past couple of years in particular,

1178
00:47:29.926 --> 00:47:33.726
is that the more willing you are to look for it,

1179
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:35.186
you find it.

1180
00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:36.806
But the finding it is not just because

1181
00:47:36.806 --> 00:47:39.806
there are VW Bugs out to be seen.

1182
00:47:39.806 --> 00:47:43.146
But it appears that it's a dynamic process,

1183
00:47:43.146 --> 00:47:45.326
and the more that you ask for it,

1184
00:47:45.326 --> 00:47:47.566
the more that it, quote, "happens."

1185
00:47:47.566 --> 00:47:49.986
Now by the way, I can only validate that

1186
00:47:49.986 --> 00:47:53.346
in the context of my own life journey.

1187
00:47:53.346 --> 00:47:55.946
But once you now lay out the hypothesis

1188
00:47:55.946 --> 00:47:57.866
and you show people how to do this science,

1189
00:47:57.866 --> 00:47:59.906
they can then test it for itself,

1190
00:47:59.906 --> 00:48:02.146
and each of us can come to our own conclusions

1191
00:48:02.146 --> 00:48:04.906
about what happens if we begin to invite this.

1192
00:48:04.906 --> 00:48:09.906
Well imagine that you're now living with a daily awareness

1193
00:48:10.726 --> 00:48:13.346
of an interconnectedness of everything,

1194
00:48:13.346 --> 00:48:16.786
and you're open to more and more pieces

1195
00:48:16.786 --> 00:48:18.406
falling into place.

1196
00:48:18.406 --> 00:48:20.406
More and more people finding each other.

1197
00:48:20.406 --> 00:48:25.376
More and more people becoming open to this one intelligence.

1198
00:48:26.526 --> 00:48:30.026
Every day not only becomes filled with surprises,

1199
00:48:30.026 --> 00:48:33.226
but there's also great joy, and great hope,

1200
00:48:33.226 --> 00:48:36.126
and great humility, and great celebration,

1201
00:48:36.126 --> 00:48:38.546
and great wonder.

1202
00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:43.256
And also a great... Also a sense of peace.

1203
00:48:43.786 --> 00:48:45.626
Because at this point, what I say,

1204
00:48:45.626 --> 00:48:47.786
I say, okay universe, if you're really

1205
00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:50.246
playing a role in all this,

1206
00:48:50.246 --> 00:48:52.766
of course you're much bigger than I am.

1207
00:48:52.766 --> 00:48:55.296
Much, much, much bigger than I am.

1208
00:48:59.786 --> 00:49:01.846
If you're gonna be playing a role,

1209
00:49:01.846 --> 00:49:03.306
then you've gotta step up to the plate

1210
00:49:03.306 --> 00:49:04.646
and you've gotta help.

1211
00:49:04.646 --> 00:49:06.386
Or you've gotta tell us what we have to do.

1212
00:49:06.386 --> 00:49:08.066
You have to give us the cues.

1213
00:49:08.066 --> 00:49:10.786
And I mean no disrespect here,

1214
00:49:10.786 --> 00:49:12.046
but I essentially said to the universe,

1215
00:49:12.046 --> 00:49:13.066
put up or shut up.

1216
00:49:13.066 --> 00:49:14.685
Either give us the evidence that we need,

1217
00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:17.325
give us guidance, be a true guiding,

1218
00:49:17.325 --> 00:49:18.545
organizing, designing process,

1219
00:49:18.545 --> 00:49:20.785
or leave us alone.

1220
00:49:20.785 --> 00:49:22.525
But you have to be a participant.

1221
00:49:22.525 --> 00:49:26.075
There's responsibility both ways.

1222
00:49:26.075 --> 00:49:29.254
And also, there is this sense

1223
00:49:29.254 --> 00:49:34.254
that to the extent that we are given the opportunity,

1224
00:49:34.894 --> 00:49:38.394
each of us in our own way come to discover this,

1225
00:49:38.394 --> 00:49:41.834
then there's an element of accepting that

1226
00:49:41.834 --> 00:49:43.574
maybe there's more going on

1227
00:49:43.574 --> 00:49:47.104
than we as individuals are seeing.

1228
00:49:47.434 --> 00:49:51.134
And so we can step back and be more comfortable

1229
00:49:51.134 --> 00:49:54.614
about allowing the process to unfold,

1230
00:49:54.614 --> 00:49:57.574
and be willing to be in the student role and learn.

1231
00:49:57.574 --> 00:49:59.434
And if that means giving up certain beliefs

1232
00:49:59.434 --> 00:50:01.974
and stereotypes, and the way we were raised

1233
00:50:01.974 --> 00:50:04.634
as Jews, or Protestants, or Catholics, or Hindus,

1234
00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:07.444
or whatever...

1235
00:50:08.934 --> 00:50:11.714
If that's what it means, then...

1236
00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:15.054
But that's been the history of our evolution anyway.

1237
00:50:15.054 --> 00:50:15.973
We used to think the Earth was flat,

1238
00:50:15.973 --> 00:50:17.393
well we didn't get it quite right.

1239
00:50:17.393 --> 00:50:18.533
It looks that way sort of,

1240
00:50:18.533 --> 00:50:19.573
but that's not the way it is.

1241
00:50:19.573 --> 00:50:21.393
We used to think the sun was revolving around the earth.

1242
00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:22.773
Well yes that's what we used to think,

1243
00:50:22.773 --> 00:50:24.233
but we didn't get it quite right.

1244
00:50:24.233 --> 00:50:26.013
We used to think that objects were mostly solid.

1245
00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:27.553
Well now we know it looks that way,

1246
00:50:27.553 --> 00:50:29.113
but that's not exactly quite right.

1247
00:50:29.113 --> 00:50:33.013
If it means we have to change our minds, big deal.

1248
00:50:33.013 --> 00:50:34.493
It's okay.

1249
00:50:34.493 --> 00:50:38.663
That's what the whole purpose of growing is all about.

1250
00:50:41.263 --> 00:50:44.852
It's not just sitting back and not taking responsibility,

1251
00:50:44.852 --> 00:50:47.532
but there is this element of, if you would,

1252
00:50:47.532 --> 00:50:50.252
trusting the process.

1253
00:50:50.252 --> 00:50:54.452
And I say this as a scientist who says,

1254
00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:57.232
give me the data or leave me alone.

1255
00:50:57.232 --> 00:50:59.052
By the way, I have a dear friend,

1256
00:50:59.052 --> 00:51:01.612
his name is Dr. James Levine,

1257
00:51:01.612 --> 00:51:06.332
who has been a very important person in my life.

1258
00:51:06.332 --> 00:51:09.012
He's played multiple roles in multiple books and so on,

1259
00:51:09.012 --> 00:51:11.572
and one of his pet phrases that he shared to me lately,

1260
00:51:11.572 --> 00:51:16.572
he says, you know Gary, you cannot gag the universe.

1261
00:51:18.712 --> 00:51:21.712
<v Woman>On that, I just want to thank you.</v>

1262
00:51:21.712 --> 00:51:23.292
Beautiful.

1263
00:51:23.752 --> 00:51:26.040
<v ->Thank you for the opportunity</v>

1264
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.980
to share part of the adventure.

1265
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.080
(peaceful instrumental music)

1266
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.719
<v ->We'll visit with Gary again when his new books come out.</v>

1267
00:51:32.719 --> 00:51:34.819
To pick up a copy of The God Experiments

1268
00:51:34.819 --> 00:51:35.979
or another of Gary's books,

1269
00:51:35.979 --> 00:51:38.119
click on the link to Amazon below.

1270
00:51:38.119 --> 00:51:41.099
Meanwhile, another scientist, laser physicist

1271
00:51:41.099 --> 00:51:43.639
Russell Targ also came to understand

1272
00:51:43.639 --> 00:51:45.919
the essence of what makes us human

1273
00:51:45.919 --> 00:51:47.939
by coming through the back door.

1274
00:51:47.939 --> 00:51:50.559
Known to many as the original X-Files guy,

1275
00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:53.339
you will likely find his story intriguing as well.

1276
00:51:53.339 --> 00:51:56.729
Until next time, thanks for watching.
