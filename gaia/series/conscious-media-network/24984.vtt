00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.750
<v ->Scott Taylor was living a quiet life as a husband,</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.571
father, and furniture maker, when he had a strange

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:09.070
visit from a man wearing a turban.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.810
The stranger gave him a scroll containing a tale from

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.030
the world of Dolphins and Whales.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.010
Scott's life changed dramatically as he begin to follow

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.990
the thread of this tale deep into the real world of our

8
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.810
magnificent citation brothers and sisters

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.460
whom he calls the citizens of the sea.

10
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.080 line:15% 
(soft music)

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.450 line:15% 
You were in the middle of a different kind of

12
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.850
life entirely, something a little bit more main stream

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.510
and an event or two occurred that took you down

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
full on down this path into the study and research

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.420
of dolphins and whales.

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410
What is it that inspired you to take this entirely

17
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.220
different direction in life?

18
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.710
<v ->Well, I feel like some destiny</v>

19
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.570
was in motion, and like you say

20
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.790
I was living an ordinary life in the middle of a

21
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.650
business and raising a family and,

22
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.910
having an average American life I suppose.

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.630
Although I don't really call myself very average.

24
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.450
And one day I got a call from someone who I didn't know

25
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.210
who wanted to stop by my house in the evening and

26
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.650
tell me about a story.

27
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.050
So I invited him to come to the house, and

28
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.290
pretty well forgot about the invitation.

29
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.830
And that evening he arrived at the door and much to

30
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.950
my amazement he was a man standing at the door with

31
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.650
a turban on his head and these brilliant sparkling eyes

32
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.670
and he told me that he something called the

33
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.910
legend of the Golden Dolphin he wanted to share with me.

34
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.820
Well it's a long story how that then developed into

35
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.660
the life that I'm living now, but

36
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.640
I'm sufficed to say it was as if,

37
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.940
the legend of the Golden Dolphin seamed to kind of

38
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.980
connect the dots in my head.

39
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.420
All these different experiences that I had,

40
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.460
thoughts that I had had, areas that I've been

41
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.120
fascinated by that seemed somehow disconnected.

42
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.320
When the legend came along it all connected into one,

43
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.221
sort of seamless picture.

44
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:08.720
And it also was full of places that I could spend my

45
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.200
own time doing my own research to validate what was there.

46
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.930
So, the story very simply is that this, the

47
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.770
legend of the Golden Dolphin pro-ports to tell the

48
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.870
true relationship between human beings and

49
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.570
whales and dolphins throughout history.

50
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.110
And even from before the time of this planet and

51
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.870
on into the future.

52
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430
It's a living story, it's not a dead artifact.

53
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.950
It's something which is constantly unfolding.

54
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.390
In fact the very fact that I'm sitting here today is

55
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.770
part of that legend.

56
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.830
And this document that we're putting together right

57
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.680
at this moment is now being woven into the legend itself.

58
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Regina>It seems that is very timely that this has</v>

59
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.130
occurred, as if you go to any -- shop

60
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.190
pretty much anywhere in the world you'll see little

61
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.690
dolphins, dolphin tails, blown glass with

62
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.030
dolphins, etcetera.

63
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.940
We do as human beings seem to have a very deep

64
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.310
curiosity about and almost a mystical kind of

65
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.130
respect for dolphins and sounds like there's very

66
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.630
good reason for that.

67
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170
<v ->Well there is and it's that very thing that I have</v>

68
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.890
found central to my research, to my investigation.

69
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.910
When you think about it, what other creature on this

70
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.690
earth do we have that kind of fascination with

71
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.570
and I mean universally?

72
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.450
Cultures around the world have fascinations with

73
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.470
the dolphin.

74
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.228
I've found that in the indigenous stories of people

75
00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:33.028
around the world, there are endless stories about

76
00:03:33.028 --> 00:03:35.328
dolphins, about whales, about how they've

77
00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:38.488
somehow touched those tribes and touched the

78
00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:39.967
stories that they hold.

79
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:43.138
The scientific community has enormous research going on

80
00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:45.757
today much more now then ever before, into the

81
00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:47.297
nature of these creatures.

82
00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:51.537
And maybe even more we can look at this extraordinary

83
00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:55.718
fact that over a billion dollars a year right now is being

84
00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:57.848
spent on whale watching.

85
00:03:58.077 --> 00:04:01.125
What other creature do we give that kind of attention to?

86
00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:05.875
There is a sensation that comes upon people when they

87
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:08.335
see a dolphin or when they see a whale.

88
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:10.375
If you're out on a whale watching trip and you're

89
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.875
with a group of people, many whom you don't know;

90
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:15.775
you're standing on the deck and the first whale appears.

91
00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:17.775
That whale comes leaping up out of the sea or

92
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:20.215
something comes up mysteriously right up there next to

93
00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:22.055
the boat, breathes next to you.

94
00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:25.155
There's this thrill of energy that goes through everyone

95
00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:27.355
and that to me is the fascinating thing.

96
00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:30.155
What is that sense that we all get from that?

97
00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:32.775
Why after that first whale appears does everyone

98
00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:35.125
suddenly become everyone else's friend?

99
00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:39.015
<v Regina>Very true and, with 71 percent of the earth</v>

100
00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:43.295
covered in water, these are the citizens

101
00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:46.295
of the sea that seem to command our

102
00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:48.335
greatest respect as well.

103
00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:50.855
Can you talk a little bit, let's go to the science

104
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:52.235
behind that a little bit.

105
00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:56.353
Just the dolphins, why don't we stick with dolphins for the

106
00:04:56.353 --> 00:04:59.233
moment even though whales are implicitly included

107
00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.763
in this, just because some of the research that's

108
00:05:01.763 --> 00:05:02.973
going on right now.

109
00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:06.473
Let's talk about the brain of the dolphin in terms of

110
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.533
the size of the brain, the way their brain functions,

111
00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:13.793
the way that their sonar functions and such.

112
00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:18.033
<v ->The dolphins' brain has been very carefully examined</v>

113
00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:20.793
for a long time because it is so unique.

114
00:05:20.793 --> 00:05:24.113
The dolphin's brain, when examined microscopically

115
00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:26.913
has the same density of neurons that the

116
00:05:26.913 --> 00:05:28.313
human brain has.

117
00:05:28.313 --> 00:05:31.473
It's organization seems to be even better organized

118
00:05:31.473 --> 00:05:34.753
in terms of the very aspects of the brain than the

119
00:05:34.753 --> 00:05:38.293
human brain, particularly for its own uses of course.

120
00:05:38.293 --> 00:05:41.233
The dolphin brain, the average dolphin brain is about

121
00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:43.993
40 percent larger than a human brain.

122
00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:47.143
It has certain aspects that we don't have.

123
00:05:47.143 --> 00:05:48.413
<v Regina>Such as?</v>

124
00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:51.373
<v ->Well there's a cortex within the dolphin's brain</v>

125
00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:53.773
that we simply have not yet developed.

126
00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:57.193
So it is considered by evolutionary biologists who

127
00:05:57.193 --> 00:06:00.533
being more advanced evolutionary organ than the

128
00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:01.473
human brain.

129
00:06:01.473 --> 00:06:03.373
<v Regina>And what is it responsible for, what way?</v>

130
00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:04.693
How does that brain function?
<v ->Well we don't know</v>

131
00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:06.533
and I think that's an interesting point that we don't

132
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.233
quite have the brain capacity to know what that

133
00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:12.013
extra section of their brain is about.

134
00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:15.433
We can, I think some assumptions might be

135
00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:19.013
alright here and that is that, this allows them to create

136
00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:22.433
kinds of associations that are a little bit beyond

137
00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:23.833
what we make.

138
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:26.693
They live in such an extraordinary environment,

139
00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:28.393
very different then ours.

140
00:06:28.393 --> 00:06:31.513
You could say that their evolution has been similar

141
00:06:31.513 --> 00:06:34.913
to ours and yet on a parallel path.

142
00:06:34.913 --> 00:06:36.953
They are very different than we are

143
00:06:36.953 --> 00:06:40.453
in many, many regards even though we share

144
00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:43.853
the basic fundaments of mammal biology

145
00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:46.233
because of the long evolutionary track that they've

146
00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:48.633
been on and we've been on separately, and the

147
00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:50.573
different environment in which we live, this is

148
00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:52.453
of course affected that.

149
00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:55.933
The dolphin brain is something which is completely

150
00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:58.396
under the control of the dolphin, and that's one of

151
00:06:58.396 --> 00:06:59.613
the great differences.

152
00:06:59.613 --> 00:07:01.485
<v Regina>Does that, as opposed to humans?</v>

153
00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:02.065
<v ->Yes.</v>

154
00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:04.125
<v Regina>Tell us the difference.</v>

155
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:07.905
<v ->Well, the very simple way to understand this is that</v>

156
00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:11.825
a dolphin, to be able to sleep, cannot simply fall

157
00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:13.705
totally asleep as we do.

158
00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:16.205
They are what's called conscious breathers.

159
00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:19.905
So every breath that we take, unless we pay attention

160
00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.265
to it, is an unconscious act.

161
00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.125
This is one of the spiritual practices that people

162
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.645
do is to pay attention to their breath.

163
00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:29.205
A dolphin is a conscious breather which means every

164
00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:31.565
breath is a conscious act.

165
00:07:31.565 --> 00:07:33.965
They're constantly having to calculate the distant

166
00:07:33.965 --> 00:07:36.865
between where they are and the surface of the sea

167
00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:39.105
because they don't breathe the environment in

168
00:07:39.105 --> 00:07:40.285
which they are.

169
00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:42.865
They have to rise to another level and enter that

170
00:07:42.865 --> 00:07:45.685
other level and expel their exhausted air and

171
00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:47.405
draw in new air.

172
00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.865
So this conscious process means that, for them to

173
00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:54.145
go asleep, to go fully unconscious as we do would be

174
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:55.965
impossible, it would be dangerous.

175
00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:58.425
They would simply go below the water, and they would

176
00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:01.785
either run out of air, or they would breathe water and die.

177
00:08:01.785 --> 00:08:06.265
So what they do is they put half of their brain to sleep.

178
00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:09.165
They have conscious control of the use of their brain

179
00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:12.085
so they can put have of it to sleep and use the other

180
00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:15.985
half to stay half awake, able then to breathe

181
00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:18.365
to rise to the surface and to continue swimming

182
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:19.805
with their friends.

183
00:08:19.805 --> 00:08:22.305
When they've done that for 20 to 40 minutes,

184
00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:25.105
they can awaken the side that was asleep and put

185
00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.485
to sleep the side that was awake and continue on

186
00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:29.465
for another 20 to 40 minutes.

187
00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:32.145
And so the average dolphins' sleep, in any

188
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:35.085
24 hour period amounts to about an hour or an

189
00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:37.125
hour and a half, total.

190
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.045
<v Regina>That's amazing considering the amount of</v>

191
00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:41.965
energy they put out during the day to navigate their

192
00:08:41.965 --> 00:08:43.905
way, play and eat and...

193
00:08:43.905 --> 00:08:46.965
<v ->They say that when a baby dolphin is born it has</v>

194
00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:49.485
to be able to swim along with the pod,

195
00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:51.985
the average distance that a pod swims in a day.

196
00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:55.645
And that may be from 10 to 40 miles in one day.

197
00:08:55.645 --> 00:08:58.225
So yes they expend an enormous amount of energy

198
00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:00.765
but they're so efficient in their movement

199
00:09:00.765 --> 00:09:03.925
that we still consider this to be one of the great

200
00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:06.505
paradoxes of physics of how a dolphin can move

201
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.315
as efficiently as it does.

202
00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:12.845
<v Regina>An area that is intriguing to me when it</v>

203
00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:15.705
comes to dolphins and we'll get into the intuitive

204
00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:18.005
abilities of dolphins as well;

205
00:09:18.005 --> 00:09:20.626
is there seems to be a certain type of

206
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:25.625
behavior that would be considered honorable

207
00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:29.515
and magnanimous even beyond that of human functioning.

208
00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:32.565
Can you speak to that subject just a little bit by

209
00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:35.425
way of either stories that have been perpetuated

210
00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:37.595
or personal observation?

211
00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:40.685
<v ->Well you could easily look into a dictionary under</v>

212
00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:43.925
the term altruism and find the picture of a dolphin.

213
00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:48.425
Their care for one another and that care also extends

214
00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:51.865
to human beings is the stuff of legends.

215
00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:55.705
As far back as you go you can find stories among people

216
00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:58.645
talking about having been rescued by dolphins.

217
00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:02.025
One of the more recent historic events that probably

218
00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:04.885
all of your viewers would be familiar with, is the

219
00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:08.205
story of Elián González, the young Cuban boy who

220
00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:11.785
on an attempt to escape with his family from Cuba,

221
00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:14.505
the boat sank and he was alone, left alone

222
00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:16.745
floating in an inner tube in the ocean.

223
00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:19.605
He floated there for several days before he was finally

224
00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:20.865
found and rescued.

225
00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.245
And then of course we know what came from that.

226
00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:25.465
When therapists in America were working with him

227
00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:27.985
and asking him to draw his experience, trying to

228
00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:31.825
help him process the horrors of this time, he kept

229
00:10:31.825 --> 00:10:34.585
drawing a picture of himself with a circle around his

230
00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:37.305
body and fins in the water, and they would say well

231
00:10:37.305 --> 00:10:38.185
what is that?

232
00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:39.825
And he said that was the dolphins.

233
00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:42.065
And they kept asking him and finally he told the story

234
00:10:42.065 --> 00:10:45.305
that he had seen sharks come and the sharks had

235
00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:48.305
in fact eaten one of the bodies of the family

236
00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:50.505
that he had been with and he was of course

237
00:10:50.505 --> 00:10:52.645
terrified of this; but before the sharks could

238
00:10:52.645 --> 00:10:54.725
get to him, the dolphins came and begin swimming

239
00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:57.105
circles around him and protecting him.

240
00:10:57.105 --> 00:11:00.545
Now this is a story, most likely, this boy

241
00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:04.195
had never heard a story like that before and he told this

242
00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:06.556
as part of a healing process for himself.

243
00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.955
They have very, very little reason to disbelieve this

244
00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:10.975
story and this is just one...

245
00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:12.365
<v Regina>And this is just one of many, yes.</v>

246
00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:14.195
<v ->One of hundreds of stories.</v>

247
00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:18.195
What I have seen, not only in my interactions with dolphins

248
00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:21.795
where I see them treating me in a very gentle and kindly

249
00:11:21.795 --> 00:11:25.455
and very tinder fashion, when I may not be feeling

250
00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:26.955
particularly energetic.

251
00:11:26.955 --> 00:11:29.275
I've taken people to swim with dolphins in the ocean,

252
00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:31.275
we've gotten in the ocean and a lot of people were

253
00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:33.755
feeling very energetic and, maybe my stomachs a

254
00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:35.975
little upset and I'm not really feeling I wanna be

255
00:11:35.975 --> 00:11:38.175
in the water right now but I have an obligation to

256
00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:40.895
be there, the dolphins treat me very gently and tenderly.

257
00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:43.635
And that same dolphin within a moment can turn around

258
00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:45.835
and go to the next person who's wanted to do the most

259
00:11:45.835 --> 00:11:47.955
athletic of things and suddenly that dolphin,

260
00:11:47.955 --> 00:11:50.375
it matches their energy and does what that person

261
00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.575
would like to do.

262
00:11:51.575 --> 00:11:54.795
So their sensitivity to who we are and the condition

263
00:11:54.795 --> 00:11:57.905
that we're in is extraordinary.

264
00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.755
<v Regina>What about stories of actually</v>

265
00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:04.115
healing, working with the healing of humans

266
00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:06.695
and their intuitive abilities in this area to

267
00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:10.305
determine where a problem might exist in a body?

268
00:12:10.655 --> 00:12:14.355
I heard you speak about one that was persistently

269
00:12:14.355 --> 00:12:17.795
touching, poking at a person until there was a bruise

270
00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:20.235
in the area and maybe you can continue that story

271
00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.835
and any others, is they're inspirational.

272
00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.335
<v ->That has happened many times in dolphin</v>

273
00:12:25.335 --> 00:12:28.335
swim facilities where a dolphin will make some kind of

274
00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:30.875
physical contact with a person and either that person

275
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.115
will feel a twinge in their body, something that they've

276
00:12:33.115 --> 00:12:34.435
never felt before.

277
00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:36.995
Or sometimes the dolphin will even go so far as to tap

278
00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:39.835
rather abruptly on a person's body and they can even

279
00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:41.936
wind up with a bruise, and that person then

280
00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:44.076
going to a doctor to say well why am I feeling so

281
00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:45.136
sensitive here?

282
00:12:45.136 --> 00:12:46.976
The doctor examines them and discovers that the

283
00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:49.116
person has a tumor, or some sort of an

284
00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:51.657
ailment that they didn't know anything about.

285
00:12:51.657 --> 00:12:54.478
It's also very common in dolphin swim facilities for

286
00:12:54.478 --> 00:12:57.356
women to discover for the first time that they're pregnant.

287
00:12:57.356 --> 00:13:00.897
The way this is done by the dolphin, because of the

288
00:13:00.897 --> 00:13:03.816
environment in which they live they must have the

289
00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.736
ability to detect in great detail the nature of

290
00:13:06.736 --> 00:13:08.176
everything around them.

291
00:13:08.176 --> 00:13:10.996
So in addition to the kind of squeaking and clicking

292
00:13:10.996 --> 00:13:13.196
sounds that we're familiar with they're making

293
00:13:13.196 --> 00:13:15.956
from shows like Flipper and various documentaries

294
00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:19.976
you've seen, the dolphins also have an ultrasonic ability.

295
00:13:19.976 --> 00:13:23.236
Just like the ultrasonic imaging that is used in hospitals

296
00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:27.276
to give a living picture of a fetus within a pregnant woman.

297
00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:30.856
Dolphins also have an ability, identical to that

298
00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:33.636
and probably much more accurate than that.

299
00:13:33.636 --> 00:13:37.476
So a dolphin can then actually look inside your body.

300
00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:40.796
It can see with its, shall we say X-ray vision,

301
00:13:40.796 --> 00:13:43.156
it can see the speed at which your heart is beating,

302
00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.356
it can see how full your lungs are, it can see

303
00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:48.216
what you had for lunch, it can see the condition

304
00:13:48.216 --> 00:13:49.676
of your endocrine system.

305
00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:51.976
If your body is suddenly pumping with adrenaline it

306
00:13:51.976 --> 00:13:54.036
can see that starting to happen.

307
00:13:54.036 --> 00:13:57.676
So a dolphin has a way of understanding us that is

308
00:13:57.676 --> 00:13:59.856
really beyond our natural abilities to

309
00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:01.476
understand each other.

310
00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:04.776
We have technology that now enables us to do that.

311
00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:06.836
But what a difference it would make for,

312
00:14:06.836 --> 00:14:09.496
for you and me sitting here if we could literally look

313
00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:11.616
inside each other to see what the condition of

314
00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:12.896
each other was.

315
00:14:12.896 --> 00:14:17.136
So you could say that the dolphin has little ability to

316
00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:18.416
to lie.

317
00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:21.896
To make up a falsehood and try to project that falsehood

318
00:14:21.896 --> 00:14:24.526
because ultimately that's going to be seen through.

319
00:14:24.716 --> 00:14:28.516
<v Regina>How do they actually use their abilities to</v>

320
00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:31.556
say affect healing in another person?

321
00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:34.136
What's going on there as you said a moment ago

322
00:14:34.136 --> 00:14:37.936
when people feel a little twinge or, and so forth?

323
00:14:37.936 --> 00:14:41.276
<v ->Well this ultrasound that they emit,</v>

324
00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:44.036
we've measured and found that they can emit almost

325
00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:47.596
five times as much power as we use in hospitals

326
00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:49.396
to shatter kidney stones.

327
00:14:49.396 --> 00:14:51.236
It's extremely powerful.

328
00:14:51.236 --> 00:14:54.156
Now this might be kind of a scary thought,

329
00:14:54.156 --> 00:14:56.796
if it weren't for the fact that we know from ancient

330
00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:59.156
history and from contemporary experience and

331
00:14:59.156 --> 00:15:01.896
lots of scientific experiments that dolphins simply

332
00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:04.696
have a purely benign relationship with human beings.

333
00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.956
They have no intention whatsoever to harm us,

334
00:15:06.956 --> 00:15:10.136
to eat us or to abuse us in any way.

335
00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:12.876
So given that, we're dealing with a creature that has

336
00:15:12.876 --> 00:15:17.116
as I said this diagnostic ability to be able to see inside

337
00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.936
to see what the actual condition of our living tissues

338
00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:23.136
are, and they also have a therapeutic ability,

339
00:15:23.136 --> 00:15:26.336
which is to send energy into our body.

340
00:15:26.336 --> 00:15:28.876
They can do this with this ultrasonic system.

341
00:15:28.876 --> 00:15:31.276
Now we don't know very much about this,

342
00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:33.856
there's a great deal of research that needs to be done.

343
00:15:33.856 --> 00:15:37.556
There are a lot of hypothesis about what's going on there.

344
00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:41.576
I think the most likely hypothesis is that the ultrasonic

345
00:15:41.576 --> 00:15:45.376
emissions of the dolphin have a way of simulating chemical

346
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.036
changes in the body.

347
00:15:47.036 --> 00:15:50.996
If we are willing to go so far as to identify that the

348
00:15:50.996 --> 00:15:54.316
human body has got an energy system within it

349
00:15:54.316 --> 00:15:59.156
that is a matrix in which all of our cells are bound,

350
00:15:59.156 --> 00:16:03.815
that that energy matrix, or that etheric body or that

351
00:16:03.815 --> 00:16:06.815
energy, the bio field of the body, seems to be

352
00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:09.275
very susceptible to dolphins.

353
00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:11.995
Because I believe there is much more involved in

354
00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:15.575
who the dolphins are then simply the biological creature.

355
00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:19.295
We're dealing with a creature that has a self awareness

356
00:16:19.295 --> 00:16:21.755
just as human beings are aware.

357
00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:25.415
We are aware not only that we are having this experience

358
00:16:25.415 --> 00:16:27.735
but we actually can observe ourselves

359
00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:29.075
having this experience.

360
00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:30.515
<v Regina>Talk about that.</v>

361
00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:34.635
<v ->And so the dolphin has that same degree of self awareness.</v>

362
00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:37.215
Let me stay on this healing thing.

363
00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:40.555
What I see the dolphin doing is its able to perceive

364
00:16:40.555 --> 00:16:43.375
many, many aspects of the human condition.

365
00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:46.175
Not only physical issues but more than that.

366
00:16:46.175 --> 00:16:48.815
Now the subject we're talking about here basically

367
00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:50.855
is dolphin assistant therapy.

368
00:16:50.855 --> 00:16:53.455
It's in in dolphin assistant therapy that a few very

369
00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:55.955
far sighted people, very sensitive people have been

370
00:16:55.955 --> 00:16:59.375
able to envision the possibility that the dolphin could

371
00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:01.715
interact with people in a very careful,

372
00:17:01.715 --> 00:17:05.015
a modality of therapeutic...

373
00:17:07.455 --> 00:17:09.755
<v Regina>With a therap...</v>

374
00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:11.715
<v ->In a therapeutic practice.</v>

375
00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:14.515
<v Regina>With a therapist there working between as the</v>

376
00:17:14.515 --> 00:17:17.195
intermediary between the dolphin and the patient.

377
00:17:17.195 --> 00:17:20.355
<v ->It's important to realize that dolphin assistant therapy</v>

378
00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:23.215
is not simply putting a person in the

379
00:17:23.215 --> 00:17:24.698
presence of a dolphin.

380
00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:27.558
Now who's to say in many cases I have seen where

381
00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:29.858
people have gotten an extraordinary amount out of

382
00:17:29.858 --> 00:17:31.358
their experience with a dolphin.

383
00:17:31.358 --> 00:17:34.278
Sometimes even physical things that they have experienced.

384
00:17:34.278 --> 00:17:37.638
But dolphin assistant therapy essentially is a human being

385
00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:40.478
who has got a high degree of skill in a

386
00:17:40.478 --> 00:17:42.098
therapeutic practice.

387
00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:44.718
Be it craniosacral therapy, occupational therapy,

388
00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:47.738
physical therapy, speech therapy, any of the main kinds of

389
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:50.638
good therapies that we have today;

390
00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:53.468
to which is added a dolphin.

391
00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:56.458
And the therapists needs to understand how that dolphin

392
00:17:56.458 --> 00:18:00.598
can accelerate, can enhance, or contribute to

393
00:18:00.598 --> 00:18:02.738
that therapeutic practice.

394
00:18:02.738 --> 00:18:06.158
So if a child comes, for instance, with autism,

395
00:18:06.158 --> 00:18:08.718
and the parents have reached their wits end.

396
00:18:08.718 --> 00:18:11.478
This child has never intentionally looked them in the eye.

397
00:18:11.478 --> 00:18:14.398
Has never expressed a word or a gesture of any kind

398
00:18:14.398 --> 00:18:15.718
of it's own needs.

399
00:18:15.718 --> 00:18:18.618
It simply exists in a very, very small and contained

400
00:18:18.618 --> 00:18:21.058
world that seems quite insensitive to all

401
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.678
approaches from outside.

402
00:18:22.678 --> 00:18:26.178
And they take this child with a therapist into the water.

403
00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:30.218
Somehow, the dolphin seems to very, very universally

404
00:18:30.218 --> 00:18:33.338
have this ability to almost, shall we say slide under

405
00:18:33.338 --> 00:18:34.358
the radar.

406
00:18:34.358 --> 00:18:37.418
This autistic child will suddenly start to pay attention.

407
00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:39.238
This dolphin has approached them in a way that

408
00:18:39.238 --> 00:18:41.578
nothing else has ever touched them,

409
00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:43.778
and they experienced something.

410
00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:45.618
Now of course we can't be in the mind of the

411
00:18:45.618 --> 00:18:46.838
autistic child.

412
00:18:46.838 --> 00:18:48.838
We don't know what it is that exactly that

413
00:18:48.838 --> 00:18:50.338
touches them in this way.

414
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:54.118
But we see enormous response, incredible reponse,

415
00:18:54.118 --> 00:18:56.658
particularly among the autistic community.

416
00:18:56.658 --> 00:18:58.878
So what are we encountering there?

417
00:18:58.878 --> 00:19:01.958
I would say not only are we seeing the physical ability

418
00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.198
of the dolphin to stimulate the physical body of the child

419
00:19:06.198 --> 00:19:09.838
but very likely this dolphin has got some access to the

420
00:19:09.838 --> 00:19:13.578
consciousness and perhaps even to the soul of that child.

421
00:19:13.578 --> 00:19:16.938
To welcome that child into life.

422
00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:20.478
I have seen families entire history be changed

423
00:19:20.478 --> 00:19:22.178
in a matter of weeks.

424
00:19:22.178 --> 00:19:25.138
With dolphin assistant therapy, a child who did not

425
00:19:25.138 --> 00:19:28.938
speak at all, within three weeks had about 30 sounds

426
00:19:28.938 --> 00:19:31.838
that she could make, and about 20 little gestures.

427
00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:34.698
Doesn't sound like much, but for a family that's been

428
00:19:34.698 --> 00:19:38.118
struggling with a child for 11 years who has never once

429
00:19:38.118 --> 00:19:41.600
ever intended to made any intentional communication,

430
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.060
to suddenly be expressing what she likes, what she

431
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.320
doesn't like;

432
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.560
this family in particular that I'm referring to, I have

433
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.740
kept track of.

434
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.260
And when I was writing my book I asked I,

435
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.080
wrote to the family and asked whether or not I could

436
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.040
publish a photograph that I had taken of their child.

437
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.080
And I asked them if they would ask her

438
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.580
whether it was okay.

439
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.220
And she responded, through the father, and said

440
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.680
yes I would like very much to have my photograph

441
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.200
published because I would like other children to know

442
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.070
what can happen.

443
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.200
Now this is a child, like I said who had never spoken.

444
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.830
So we see remarkable things occur and a

445
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.581
tremendous amount of credit must be given to the

446
00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:23.981
human therapist.

447
00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:27.061
We mustn't think of this as a silver bullet.

448
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:29.443
This is not just a magical process which is suddenly gonna

449
00:20:29.443 --> 00:20:31.001
change anything.

450
00:20:31.001 --> 00:20:33.241
The therapist must be very competent.

451
00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:37.221
Sadly actually to my mind, there is very little

452
00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:39.301
dolphin assistant therapy going on.

453
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:43.161
This story captured the human imagination

454
00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:46.741
in the very early 1990s when several stories were published

455
00:20:46.741 --> 00:20:48.741
they were widely distributed.

456
00:20:48.741 --> 00:20:50.741
And this seems to have caught fire in the

457
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:52.241
human imagination.

458
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:54.781
Virtually everywhere I've been around the world and

459
00:20:54.781 --> 00:20:56.221
I mean around the world.

460
00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:58.581
I can be talking to the most average of person,

461
00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:00.861
and I'll say something about dolphins and my work

462
00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:03.921
with dolphins and usually within a minute or two they say

463
00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:05.941
don't dolphins do something wonderful with

464
00:21:05.941 --> 00:21:08.301
challenged children or children with autism,

465
00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:09.921
down syndrome children?

466
00:21:09.921 --> 00:21:12.441
Well the fact that there is so little of it going on

467
00:21:12.441 --> 00:21:14.681
around the world and yet it is so prevalent in our

468
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:18.041
imagination, tells me something again about the importance

469
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.241
of our relationship with the dolphin.

470
00:21:20.241 --> 00:21:22.621
The people who are doing the most significant,

471
00:21:22.621 --> 00:21:24.761
the most beautiful and I would say the most,

472
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:28.001
reliably effective dolphin assistant therapy, are

473
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:29.941
in an organization in Florida which is called

474
00:21:29.941 --> 00:21:31.621
Island Dolphin Care.

475
00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:34.441
And you can find them, Island Dolphin Care dot com

476
00:21:34.441 --> 00:21:35.761
through the internet.

477
00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.021
The woman there named Deena Hoagland

478
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:41.401
and her husband Pete have been running this program

479
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:43.081
now for about 10 years.

480
00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:45.281
We were just there just a couple of weeks ago,

481
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.821
and they had just had the grand opening of a

482
00:21:47.821 --> 00:21:51.301
brand new three million dollar facility that they had built,

483
00:21:51.301 --> 00:21:54.121
specifically for dolphin assistant therapy.

484
00:21:54.121 --> 00:21:56.441
So they deal with special needs children from

485
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.741
around the world.

486
00:21:57.741 --> 00:21:59.581
They've never raised their prices.

487
00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:02.261
They're running a non profit organization there and the

488
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:04.731
results are absolutely stunning.

489
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:08.681
Where this is gonna go, I'm very happy to say

490
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:11.043
that there are now several facilities that are being

491
00:22:11.043 --> 00:22:13.083
either remodeled because they are very, very

492
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:16.223
old facilities and one in fact is being built

493
00:22:16.223 --> 00:22:19.063
from the ground up to do dolphin assistant therapy.

494
00:22:19.063 --> 00:22:21.723
So we are looking toward a time when this is gonna be

495
00:22:21.723 --> 00:22:23.023
much more prevalent.

496
00:22:23.023 --> 00:22:25.493
Right now there are very few places where it's done.

497
00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:28.123
<v Regina>Looking at that through perhaps the</v>

498
00:22:28.123 --> 00:22:32.063
opposite lens, I've also read studies

499
00:22:32.063 --> 00:22:36.223
in the past where dolphins were utilized by the military

500
00:22:36.223 --> 00:22:40.423
to be able to carry out more destructive missions

501
00:22:40.423 --> 00:22:41.463
as it were.

502
00:22:41.463 --> 00:22:45.183
Carrying explosives with them, etcetera.

503
00:22:46.303 --> 00:22:50.803
Why do you think a dolphin could be coerced into

504
00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:52.483
doing such a thing?

505
00:22:52.483 --> 00:22:55.643
I've always wondered about that because they're so

506
00:22:55.643 --> 00:22:58.883
they seem to have such an incredibly open heart

507
00:22:58.883 --> 00:23:02.783
and strong desire to help us in whatever we request.

508
00:23:02.783 --> 00:23:04.693
What's up with that?

509
00:23:04.743 --> 00:23:06.803
<v ->Well there is that factor right there.</v>

510
00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:09.323
A dolphin is fascinated by human beings and human

511
00:23:09.323 --> 00:23:13.563
activities and we must not let ourselves project onto

512
00:23:13.563 --> 00:23:17.003
the dolphin our own ideas and our own

513
00:23:17.873 --> 00:23:19.683
our own values really.

514
00:23:19.683 --> 00:23:22.123
A dolphin wouldn't know that that package of things

515
00:23:22.123 --> 00:23:25.263
that it's been asked to carry our there is explosives.

516
00:23:25.983 --> 00:23:28.883
However, that being said, that U.S. Navy

517
00:23:28.883 --> 00:23:31.583
attempted for quite a long time to enlist dolphins

518
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:34.563
as soldiers to do

519
00:23:34.563 --> 00:23:37.423
very damaging things, I'll put it that way.

520
00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:40.323
And the Navy still to this day denies

521
00:23:40.323 --> 00:23:43.623
certain aspects of this story, but there are very

522
00:23:43.623 --> 00:23:45.643
credible reports from people who did work in the

523
00:23:45.643 --> 00:23:49.323
program, indicating that in fact dolphins were

524
00:23:49.323 --> 00:23:51.223
enlisted to be soldiers.

525
00:23:51.223 --> 00:23:54.423
Eventually the Navy stopped that whole aspect of their

526
00:23:54.423 --> 00:23:57.643
work because they found the dolphins to be simply

527
00:23:57.643 --> 00:24:00.543
incapable of determining the difference between an

528
00:24:00.543 --> 00:24:02.305
enemy person and a friendly person.

529
00:24:02.305 --> 00:24:03.725
(laughing)

530
00:24:03.725 --> 00:24:05.145
There's no difference to a dolphin.

531
00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:06.125
<v Regina>Quote backfired.</v>

532
00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:07.505
<v ->It backfired.</v>

533
00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:09.965
At one point the U.S. Navy, and this was about

534
00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:13.505
10 years ago, made a big public statement it was widely

535
00:24:13.505 --> 00:24:15.242
publicized that they were decommissioning

536
00:24:15.242 --> 00:24:16.262
all their dolphins.

537
00:24:16.262 --> 00:24:17.722
They were giving up on dolphins.

538
00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:20.362
Dolphins just simply weren't amenable to this kind of work.

539
00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:22.002
They were giving up entirely.

540
00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:24.242
In fact they said that they'd much rather work with

541
00:24:24.242 --> 00:24:26.542
seals because you could go to sort of snap your fingers

542
00:24:26.542 --> 00:24:28.201
they seal would jump in the back of a pickup truck

543
00:24:28.201 --> 00:24:29.562
and you can go where you wanna do.

544
00:24:29.562 --> 00:24:31.142
Dolphins are a lot more difficult and

545
00:24:31.142 --> 00:24:33.262
dolphins don't do what you ask them to do.

546
00:24:33.262 --> 00:24:36.882
And I must say without going into any graphic details

547
00:24:36.882 --> 00:24:40.622
that the military tried some very, very extreme measures

548
00:24:40.622 --> 00:24:44.203
to try to get dolphins to do what they wanted them to do.

549
00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:49.802
However, what happened as a result of the Iraq war

550
00:24:49.802 --> 00:24:53.282
when six dolphins were taken to Iraq to help them

551
00:24:53.282 --> 00:24:55.122
clear the harbor there.

552
00:24:55.122 --> 00:24:57.961
Looking for mines and unexploded ordinates on the

553
00:24:57.961 --> 00:25:00.222
bottom of the harbor.

554
00:25:00.222 --> 00:25:02.722
They took six dolphins from their training facility

555
00:25:02.722 --> 00:25:06.162
in San Diego and they have them outfitted

556
00:25:06.162 --> 00:25:07.562
with video cameras.

557
00:25:07.562 --> 00:25:09.002
This is what they've come to now.

558
00:25:09.002 --> 00:25:11.602
They strap a video camera on the pectoral fin and the

559
00:25:11.602 --> 00:25:14.022
dolphin will swim around and they've been instructed

560
00:25:14.022 --> 00:25:17.422
to swim very slowly and in these sort of grip patterns.

561
00:25:17.422 --> 00:25:20.362
So the technician can be watching through this video

562
00:25:20.362 --> 00:25:23.502
camera and see what's on the bottom and then with a

563
00:25:23.502 --> 00:25:25.762
mapping system they can tell where these things are

564
00:25:25.762 --> 00:25:27.442
and they can go in a remove them.

565
00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:30.002
And it was actually very successfully done that the

566
00:25:30.002 --> 00:25:32.722
dolphins made a very real contribution to that.

567
00:25:32.722 --> 00:25:36.082
One interesting story is that when they got there,

568
00:25:36.082 --> 00:25:38.642
they put the six dolphins in the water after they've

569
00:25:38.642 --> 00:25:40.562
been accumulated for a little while and they had

570
00:25:40.562 --> 00:25:42.722
their little video camera strapped on them and they

571
00:25:42.722 --> 00:25:45.202
were sort of told go, and one of them sort of turned

572
00:25:45.202 --> 00:25:47.342
around and said well thanks for all the fish

573
00:25:47.342 --> 00:25:49.862
I'm out of here and left.

574
00:25:50.412 --> 00:25:53.122
I enjoy that part of the story I think that's wonderful

575
00:25:53.122 --> 00:25:55.322
that the dolphin had enough independence of its

576
00:25:55.322 --> 00:25:57.542
own mind that it just decided he wanted to go off and

577
00:25:57.542 --> 00:25:59.702
wonder around and see what was there and

578
00:25:59.702 --> 00:26:01.442
kind of on a holiday.

579
00:26:01.442 --> 00:26:03.662
But there's another part of the story which is also

580
00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:07.222
fascinating and that is that four days later Tahoma,

581
00:26:07.222 --> 00:26:08.982
this dolphin returned.

582
00:26:08.982 --> 00:26:12.222
Now this fits in with other stories that I know of

583
00:26:12.222 --> 00:26:15.932
where dolphins have sought out human care.

584
00:26:16.462 --> 00:26:18.602
They've actually come to human beings who were

585
00:26:18.602 --> 00:26:21.722
running dolphin facilities and said please let me in.

586
00:26:21.722 --> 00:26:25.322
After hurricane Andrew swept through the Florida keys

587
00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:26.702
some years ago.

588
00:26:26.702 --> 00:26:29.122
At one the dolphin facilities there actually had to

589
00:26:29.122 --> 00:26:31.822
drop all of their fences and force all the dolphins

590
00:26:31.822 --> 00:26:33.882
to leave, they had 17 dolphins.

591
00:26:33.882 --> 00:26:36.702
Once they were able to get back down after the

592
00:26:36.702 --> 00:26:39.882
alert had been called off, they went back down,

593
00:26:39.882 --> 00:26:42.862
they were hoping of course the dolphins would reappear.

594
00:26:42.862 --> 00:26:46.272
Well within a few days they had 22 dolphins.

595
00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:49.342
So the dolphins had gone out and said hey you guys

596
00:26:49.342 --> 00:26:50.340
come on back we got a

597
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.480
good place to be.
<v Regina>Free fish.</v>

598
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.640
<v ->Yeah free fish.</v>

599
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.080
<v Regina>Well let's talk about that a little bit</v>

600
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.700
because that's certainly a controversial issue is

601
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.590
should we be domesticating these wild creatures?

602
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.680
Certainly I have mixed feelings on it, it seems as

603
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.074
though it's on one hand a wonderful thing and that

604
00:27:07.074 --> 00:27:09.574
humans can have close-up interactions with them,

605
00:27:09.574 --> 00:27:10.994
and this is one way to do it

606
00:27:10.994 --> 00:27:13.834
On the other you wonder about their own sense of

607
00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:15.514
joy and freedom.

608
00:27:15.514 --> 00:27:17.234
So what is your take on it?

609
00:27:17.234 --> 00:27:19.734
<v ->Well it is a very sensitive issue and it's one that I've</v>

610
00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:21.614
struggled with a lot over time.

611
00:27:21.614 --> 00:27:24.074
I began from the point of view that all dolphins should

612
00:27:24.074 --> 00:27:26.554
be free and that our interaction with them should only be

613
00:27:26.554 --> 00:27:28.112
in the wild.

614
00:27:28.112 --> 00:27:31.792
For me there was a real epiphany when I went to visit a

615
00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:34.912
dolphin, she was the dolphin I first swam with.

616
00:27:34.912 --> 00:27:38.272
I had such an extraordinary experience with her

617
00:27:38.272 --> 00:27:41.272
that about six years later I went back to see her,

618
00:27:41.272 --> 00:27:44.213
not telling the people who care for her that I was

619
00:27:44.213 --> 00:27:47.292
there to try to find someway to get her free.

620
00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:50.392
And they were very nice very generous with me

621
00:27:50.392 --> 00:27:51.892
and they said well you can just go out and spend some

622
00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:54.412
time sitting by the pool with dolphin.

623
00:27:54.412 --> 00:27:56.152
This is during the rest period of the day when the

624
00:27:56.152 --> 00:27:58.412
dolphins are not to be interacted with.

625
00:27:58.412 --> 00:28:00.672
So I went out and sat beside the pool and I began

626
00:28:00.672 --> 00:28:02.872
talking to this dolphin, her name is Squirt.

627
00:28:02.872 --> 00:28:05.212
And I said to her look Squirt I'd really like to

628
00:28:05.212 --> 00:28:07.272
know what I can do to get you out of here.

629
00:28:07.272 --> 00:28:10.432
Have you got any ideas and how it is living here?

630
00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:13.272
And she preceded to show me, and I can only say that

631
00:28:13.272 --> 00:28:14.972
this was a subjective experience.

632
00:28:14.972 --> 00:28:17.412
This was what I felt a kind a soul to

633
00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:19.113
soul communication.
<v Regina>Almost telepathic</v>

634
00:28:19.113 --> 00:28:22.552
in a sense a deeper...
<v ->Well yes telepathy does</v>

635
00:28:22.552 --> 00:28:25.452
definitely play a role in who the dolphins are.

636
00:28:25.452 --> 00:28:28.313
And that's a subject we can definitely talk about some more.

637
00:28:28.313 --> 00:28:31.712
But I experienced with her over that next hour,

638
00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:35.992
an incredibly clear, and distinct

639
00:28:35.992 --> 00:28:39.612
mesage from her saying please don't even think about

640
00:28:39.612 --> 00:28:40.952
letting me out of here.

641
00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:42.232
I don't want to leave here.

642
00:28:42.232 --> 00:28:44.552
My life is completely fulfilled here.

643
00:28:44.552 --> 00:28:47.452
This is where I get to be, to do what my mission

644
00:28:47.452 --> 00:28:48.792
in life is.

645
00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:51.752
Every single day people bring me children who have

646
00:28:51.752 --> 00:28:54.352
needs and I get to work with them, and I'm

647
00:28:54.352 --> 00:28:56.712
working with a wonderful staff who love me,

648
00:28:56.712 --> 00:28:59.572
who care for me, this is where I'm meant to be

649
00:28:59.572 --> 00:29:01.992
don't even think about letting me out of here.

650
00:29:01.992 --> 00:29:03.692
Now that was shocking to me.

651
00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:05.812
It was not what I wanted to hear.

652
00:29:05.812 --> 00:29:08.512
This is part of how we can learn to validate telepathic

653
00:29:08.512 --> 00:29:10.793
transmission, or information that's coming from

654
00:29:10.793 --> 00:29:11.912
outside yourself.

655
00:29:11.912 --> 00:29:13.772
When it's something you don't want to hear,

656
00:29:13.772 --> 00:29:15.952
that's when it may very well be the most true,

657
00:29:15.952 --> 00:29:17.254
and most real.

658
00:29:17.254 --> 00:29:20.352
So this changed my attitude dramatically,

659
00:29:20.352 --> 00:29:23.872
and I knew in that instant, that this was going to

660
00:29:23.872 --> 00:29:26.252
tremendously change my relationship with a lot of

661
00:29:26.252 --> 00:29:29.412
my friends, who also held this very strong opinion that

662
00:29:29.412 --> 00:29:31.952
dolphins should all be free which it did.

663
00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:34.752
It did change my relationship with many friends.

664
00:29:34.752 --> 00:29:37.392
Over the years I think many of them now have begun

665
00:29:37.392 --> 00:29:38.912
to come to my view.

666
00:29:38.912 --> 00:29:41.692
And that simply is that dolphins also have a

667
00:29:41.692 --> 00:29:44.592
destiny in which they live, just as we do.

668
00:29:44.592 --> 00:29:47.392
Each one of us has a life that has a purpose,

669
00:29:47.392 --> 00:29:50.632
that is designed by something else, some great intelligence

670
00:29:50.632 --> 00:29:53.072
that leads our lives, guides us.

671
00:29:53.072 --> 00:29:56.412
And we can put that in the terms of the soul.

672
00:29:56.412 --> 00:29:59.032
I believe that each of us as a human being is not

673
00:29:59.032 --> 00:30:01.852
only a soul, but we are self aware souls.

674
00:30:01.852 --> 00:30:03.712
And this is just an extraordinary thing.

675
00:30:03.712 --> 00:30:08.212
I also say that the dolphins have not only very vital souls

676
00:30:08.212 --> 00:30:10.372
but they are clearly aware of that.

677
00:30:10.372 --> 00:30:12.932
They observe their own reality.

678
00:30:12.932 --> 00:30:16.892
And so when we say that our soul has guided us to

679
00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:18.432
live the life that we're living.

680
00:30:18.432 --> 00:30:21.252
Perhaps to have chosen the parents that we were born through

681
00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:24.332
to encounter certain learning in moments in our lives,

682
00:30:24.332 --> 00:30:27.732
why can't we also extend that same understanding

683
00:30:27.732 --> 00:30:29.292
to the dolphins.

684
00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:32.432
So if a dolphin is born in captivity, and I

685
00:30:32.432 --> 00:30:34.172
rarely use the word captivity.

686
00:30:34.172 --> 00:30:36.832
I'm only using it for this particular purpose.

687
00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:40.652
If a dolphin is born in a human managed facility,

688
00:30:40.652 --> 00:30:43.112
what is the destiny of that dolphin?

689
00:30:43.112 --> 00:30:45.692
It can never be returned to the ocean.

690
00:30:45.692 --> 00:30:48.072
It can't be returned to a place it's never been.

691
00:30:48.072 --> 00:30:50.072
It doesn't understand that.

692
00:30:50.072 --> 00:30:52.892
Now it gets a little bit complex, but let me just follow

693
00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:54.292
one track here.

694
00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:59.052
Right now there are somewhere around 3,000 or

695
00:30:59.052 --> 00:31:01.872
3,500 dolphins around the world that are living in

696
00:31:01.872 --> 00:31:03.892
human managed facilities.

697
00:31:03.892 --> 00:31:07.812
Of those let's say 3,000, probably over half

698
00:31:07.812 --> 00:31:09.882
were born in facilities.

699
00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:12.872
So let's just look at those half.

700
00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:15.812
Those let's say 1,500 dolphins around the world,

701
00:31:15.812 --> 00:31:17.252
if we're gonna treat them well.

702
00:31:17.252 --> 00:31:19.412
If we're gonna give them proper care,

703
00:31:19.412 --> 00:31:22.272
we must allow them to be in mixed society,

704
00:31:22.272 --> 00:31:24.252
males and females together.

705
00:31:24.252 --> 00:31:26.432
If you've got males and females together, you're

706
00:31:26.432 --> 00:31:27.952
gonna have offspring.

707
00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:32.372
So very simply mathematically we have a geometrically

708
00:31:32.372 --> 00:31:36.132
exponentially, increasing population of dolphins who

709
00:31:36.132 --> 00:31:38.192
have never been in the sea.

710
00:31:38.192 --> 00:31:40.572
There are dolphins now that are six generations

711
00:31:40.572 --> 00:31:42.732
away from the ocean.

712
00:31:42.732 --> 00:31:45.622
You have to say this is another kind of dolphin.

713
00:31:45.632 --> 00:31:49.032
This is a dolphin who's life is meant to be, if you will,

714
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:50.512
among human beings.

715
00:31:50.512 --> 00:31:54.452
And this calls us out, as human beings this calls to us

716
00:31:54.452 --> 00:31:57.212
a level of responsibility, that we have maybe never

717
00:31:57.212 --> 00:31:58.672
completely shouldered.

718
00:31:58.672 --> 00:32:00.812
How are we gonna care for these creatures?

719
00:32:00.812 --> 00:32:03.552
If we're gonna recognize them for who they truly are,

720
00:32:03.552 --> 00:32:06.452
are we gonna rise to that level of responsibility,

721
00:32:06.452 --> 00:32:09.172
to give them all that they should have?

722
00:32:09.172 --> 00:32:10.992
So, we've got that aspect.

723
00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:14.372
We've got this ever increasing population of dolphins

724
00:32:14.372 --> 00:32:16.312
who are born among humans.

725
00:32:16.312 --> 00:32:18.692
We have another population of dolphins who have

726
00:32:18.692 --> 00:32:20.732
been brought in from the wild.

727
00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:23.232
As time goes by, there will be less and less

728
00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:27.572
and less of those required, if you will, to provide

729
00:32:27.572 --> 00:32:31.012
the interaction that there is a tremendous demand for.

730
00:32:31.012 --> 00:32:34.672
Now I have looked very, very carefully at this whole

731
00:32:34.672 --> 00:32:37.852
story of the acquisition of wild dolphins.

732
00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:41.512
And I have to admit that there have been horrific stories

733
00:32:41.512 --> 00:32:43.092
terrible stories.

734
00:32:43.092 --> 00:32:45.792
Stories where quite a number of dolphins die just for

735
00:32:45.792 --> 00:32:47.972
one to be able to survive.

736
00:32:47.972 --> 00:32:50.952
That kind of story I'm happy to report is a thing

737
00:32:50.952 --> 00:32:52.812
very much of the past.

738
00:32:52.812 --> 00:32:55.472
People who go out to gather dolphins now, are

739
00:32:55.472 --> 00:32:59.052
extremely sensitive and becausefor one thing, and I'd

740
00:32:59.052 --> 00:33:01.832
hate to make it be this way but the simple economics

741
00:33:01.832 --> 00:33:04.612
of dealing with dolphins and caring for them,

742
00:33:04.612 --> 00:33:07.392
when it's a dolphin who just simply doesn't want to

743
00:33:07.392 --> 00:33:10.652
be among human beings, it's way too expensive.

744
00:33:10.652 --> 00:33:14.132
So what has happened as a result of the interest in

745
00:33:14.132 --> 00:33:17.712
having wild dolphins brought into the facilities, is that

746
00:33:17.712 --> 00:33:19.992
the people who were going out and gathering them

747
00:33:19.992 --> 00:33:22.432
are extremely sensitive to whether or not this dolphin

748
00:33:22.432 --> 00:33:25.272
is okay with being among human beings.

749
00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:28.192
The ways that they are brought out of the ocean now

750
00:33:28.192 --> 00:33:31.372
are much, much more gentle than ever before.

751
00:33:31.372 --> 00:33:34.912
And I really mustn't say where this is happening

752
00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:37.332
but there are several places in the world where,

753
00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:40.352
villages have been developing relationships with dolphins

754
00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:42.152
for many generations.

755
00:33:42.152 --> 00:33:44.332
The dolphins come in in a very friendly way,

756
00:33:44.332 --> 00:33:47.712
they interact with these people and what these people,

757
00:33:47.712 --> 00:33:50.032
these are typically in third world countries where there's

758
00:33:50.032 --> 00:33:52.232
very little income of any other kind;

759
00:33:52.232 --> 00:33:54.452
these people develop a relationship with the dolphin

760
00:33:54.452 --> 00:33:55.832
where they're feeding the dolphins.

761
00:33:55.832 --> 00:33:57.792
The dolphins become quite accumulated to humans,

762
00:33:57.792 --> 00:33:59.992
they become quite happy to be around human beings

763
00:33:59.992 --> 00:34:03.012
and those dolphins are carefully sometimes selected

764
00:34:03.012 --> 00:34:05.272
and taken to dolphin facilities.

765
00:34:05.272 --> 00:34:08.452
So at no time is there any kind of a physical

766
00:34:08.452 --> 00:34:11.772
forcing of a dolphin out of the ocean in that case.

767
00:34:13.512 --> 00:34:15.352
And that's certainly not to say that there aren't

768
00:34:15.352 --> 00:34:17.102
people who are

769
00:34:18.312 --> 00:34:20.052
rapacious in their attitude.

770
00:34:20.052 --> 00:34:21.892
Their certainly still are people out there who would

771
00:34:21.892 --> 00:34:24.032
just go out and throw a lasso around a dolphin and

772
00:34:24.032 --> 00:34:26.092
drag it on a boat and take it in some,

773
00:34:26.092 --> 00:34:28.332
into some pool they've dug with a back hoe

774
00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:31.092
and thrown some salt in the water and play with it

775
00:34:31.092 --> 00:34:32.672
often and charge money for it.

776
00:34:32.672 --> 00:34:34.772
The dolphin lives for a couple of months, dies

777
00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:36.112
and they go out and get another one.

778
00:34:36.112 --> 00:34:37.432
This is a horrible thing.

779
00:34:37.432 --> 00:34:39.872
It's been happening in Central and South America now for

780
00:34:39.872 --> 00:34:44.062
some time and it's a very real concern and I'm very

781
00:34:44.062 --> 00:34:46.552
I have a lot of respect for people who are

782
00:34:46.552 --> 00:34:49.462
struggling against that situation trying to stop it.

783
00:34:50.512 --> 00:34:54.392
But let's keep in mind that right now there are

784
00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:58.032
somewhere between two and three hundred thousand

785
00:34:58.032 --> 00:35:01.932
people every year, who are seeking out the experience

786
00:35:01.932 --> 00:35:04.232
of swimming with a dolphin.

787
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:08.972
Very few of them have the athletic ability,

788
00:35:09.772 --> 00:35:14.230
the opportunity, the time

789
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.890
to go to the wild and take their chance that they

790
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.070
might have the opportunity to swim with the dolphin

791
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.290
in the wild.

792
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.530
And I also think that there's something a bit more

793
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.450
appropriate about not going out and leaping into

794
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.250
the living room of the wild dolphins and saying

795
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.650
come on let's play.

796
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.790
Many of those dolphins don't want to hang out

797
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.490
with human beings.

798
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.330
So we've gotta, it's a complex issue.

799
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.170
But I think with a just a half step back

800
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.290
we can look at this and we can say you know

801
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.490
we're starting to very appropriate in our care for them.

802
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.730
There is a tremendous demand.

803
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.490
The London Times and the Melbourne Australia

804
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.490
daily newspaper each did an interview of over

805
00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.010
1,000 people and asked them what are the 10

806
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.410
top things that you would like to be sure you do

807
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.530
before you die?

808
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.550
And in both cases the number one response was

809
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.030
I want to swim with a dolphin

810
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.888
before I die.
<v Regina>That would've been</v>

811
00:36:05.888 --> 00:36:09.586
mine I've said the same thing, for years and years.

812
00:36:09.696 --> 00:36:12.096
<v ->And why is that, this is part of my fascination;</v>

813
00:36:12.096 --> 00:36:16.236
what is it that is of such residence and of such importance?

814
00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:18.956
What is it about the beauty, the embodiment

815
00:36:18.956 --> 00:36:22.838
that the dolphin is that draws us in this inexorable way

816
00:36:22.838 --> 00:36:24.596
toward this encounter?

817
00:36:24.596 --> 00:36:26.726
There's something there for us.

818
00:36:27.076 --> 00:36:29.106
<v Regina>On that note,</v>

819
00:36:29.616 --> 00:36:33.046
there are people around the planet,

820
00:36:33.196 --> 00:36:36.058
often times movie stars and other elites that

821
00:36:36.058 --> 00:36:39.656
that wear a little gold dolphin around their neck

822
00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:41.876
and this has to do with where we started in this

823
00:36:41.876 --> 00:36:44.556
interview, the legend of the Golden Dolphin.

824
00:36:44.556 --> 00:36:47.956
Now if dolphin appears in pictographs and in

825
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:51.016
petroglyphs and everything else throughout history

826
00:36:51.016 --> 00:36:54.936
around the globe, and the note said it was an

827
00:36:54.936 --> 00:36:57.617
important part of our past on many levels,

828
00:36:57.617 --> 00:37:01.116
where does that take us into the future from what

829
00:37:01.116 --> 00:37:04.496
you know and I know the Golden Dolphin's a very

830
00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:08.366
long story but in a nut shell?

831
00:37:08.436 --> 00:37:11.256
<v ->Well the legend of the Golden Dolphin tells this</v>

832
00:37:11.256 --> 00:37:15.196
extraordinary story of the westward movement of the

833
00:37:15.196 --> 00:37:18.236
influence of the dolphin spirit;

834
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:21.296
and how it has touched us as human beings.

835
00:37:21.296 --> 00:37:23.576
You could say that the dolphins perhaps even help us

836
00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:25.916
become human in the beginning.

837
00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:28.446
Excuse me (coughs).

838
00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:32.356
So the legend of the Golden Dolphin talks about these

839
00:37:32.356 --> 00:37:35.876
cultural influences in different places.

840
00:37:35.876 --> 00:37:38.396
In India the first incarnation of Vishnu,

841
00:37:38.396 --> 00:37:41.736
one of the gods of Hinduism, the first incarnation;

842
00:37:41.736 --> 00:37:45.396
the first of 10, the first incarnation was as a dolphin.

843
00:37:46.016 --> 00:37:49.096
When we and there he supposedly brought the

844
00:37:49.096 --> 00:37:52.506
civilizing arts to a barbaric mankind.

845
00:37:52.996 --> 00:37:55.376
If you move westward and you come to Samaria

846
00:37:55.376 --> 00:37:58.216
and the cradle of civilization, the earliest times

847
00:37:58.216 --> 00:38:02.056
there you also have a tradition of these fish like

848
00:38:02.056 --> 00:38:04.856
beings who came up out of the ocean to speak

849
00:38:04.856 --> 00:38:07.456
to man to give them the civilizing arts.

850
00:38:07.456 --> 00:38:09.556
And if you compare the list of what those civilizing

851
00:38:09.556 --> 00:38:11.516
arts they're exactly the same.

852
00:38:11.516 --> 00:38:14.616
In Egypt you have this mysterious story of Osiris

853
00:38:14.616 --> 00:38:17.656
who was a god of the waters who lived in water,

854
00:38:17.656 --> 00:38:20.096
who had glistening skin and taught people about

855
00:38:20.096 --> 00:38:22.016
life and the nature of life.

856
00:38:22.016 --> 00:38:24.856
And cultures all throughout Africa.

857
00:38:24.856 --> 00:38:27.676
You come to the story of Greece, the entire story

858
00:38:27.676 --> 00:38:31.176
of Greece was enlightened by the spirit of the Dolphin.

859
00:38:31.176 --> 00:38:34.896
It came through Apollo in the oracle of Delphi.

860
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:37.696
The oracle Delphi was the place where the voice of Apollo

861
00:38:37.696 --> 00:38:40.556
was heard in his form of a dolphin.

862
00:38:40.556 --> 00:38:43.896
And it was from there that the Apollo temples

863
00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:47.236
were built in all the cities of Greece

864
00:38:47.236 --> 00:38:49.596
as it expanded around the Mediterranean.

865
00:38:49.596 --> 00:38:53.676
The temple of Apollo was where law was dispensed,

866
00:38:53.676 --> 00:38:56.196
was were people would go for

867
00:38:57.236 --> 00:39:00.196
answers to life's deepest questions.

868
00:39:00.196 --> 00:39:02.736
This all came through the spirit of the Dolphin.

869
00:39:02.736 --> 00:39:05.156
And it was there in Greece that the idea of

870
00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:06.736
democracy was born.

871
00:39:06.736 --> 00:39:09.896
And it was born out of this dolphin story.

872
00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:12.716
Because the dolphins always, throughout time and

873
00:39:12.716 --> 00:39:15.716
in every culture, have brought people to that very thing

874
00:39:15.716 --> 00:39:18.956
we've been talking about, about self reflection.

875
00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:21.396
When you encounter the dolphin, you look into the

876
00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:24.216
eye of a dolphin, you realize there's somebody

877
00:39:24.216 --> 00:39:26.636
there looking back at you.

878
00:39:26.636 --> 00:39:28.776
Different from a dolphin, excuse me,

879
00:39:28.776 --> 00:39:30.956
different than a dog, different than a wolf,

880
00:39:30.956 --> 00:39:32.736
different than an elephant even.

881
00:39:32.736 --> 00:39:35.356
A dolphin has a presence that it's clearly

882
00:39:35.356 --> 00:39:37.636
intelligent which looks back at you.

883
00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:40.556
And so you have this experience of reflection.

884
00:39:40.556 --> 00:39:43.136
Someone's looking at me, I'm looking at someone.

885
00:39:43.136 --> 00:39:46.376
Suddenly that observer state comes into play.

886
00:39:46.376 --> 00:39:50.156
So it was in recognition of the self and the

887
00:39:50.156 --> 00:39:54.876
divinity, the god self that lies within us, the awaken soul.

888
00:39:54.876 --> 00:39:57.396
This is the beginning in Greece of this whole

889
00:39:57.396 --> 00:39:59.496
idea of democracy.

890
00:39:59.496 --> 00:40:03.036
That it is not appropriate for a few human beings

891
00:40:03.036 --> 00:40:07.156
to run all of the rest of humanity for their own purposes

892
00:40:07.156 --> 00:40:10.296
but in fact the voice of everyone combined together

893
00:40:10.296 --> 00:40:12.356
should be what guides us.

894
00:40:12.356 --> 00:40:14.276
And this is still something we're struggling with.

895
00:40:14.276 --> 00:40:16.236
Still something we're attempting to bring out,

896
00:40:16.236 --> 00:40:17.956
and bring into manifestation.

897
00:40:17.956 --> 00:40:19.636
There have been wonderful experiments,

898
00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:21.776
the American experiment being one.

899
00:40:21.776 --> 00:40:23.996
We've come now to a time where we're having to

900
00:40:23.996 --> 00:40:25.836
look at it and say, wait a minute,

901
00:40:25.836 --> 00:40:28.496
is this democracy we're experiencing here or is this

902
00:40:28.496 --> 00:40:30.196
something else?

903
00:40:30.196 --> 00:40:34.056
So this, the influence of the dolphins throughout time

904
00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:36.456
up into Greece was extraordinary.

905
00:40:36.456 --> 00:40:38.876
We can see it in mythology, we can see this

906
00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:40.536
these elements now that have entered into

907
00:40:40.536 --> 00:40:42.676
things that we have experienced today.

908
00:40:42.676 --> 00:40:44.976
Coming forward through time we see the

909
00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:48.376
entire era of wailing, which was a 600 year period

910
00:40:48.376 --> 00:40:51.676
when humanity was lifted up to an entirely

911
00:40:51.676 --> 00:40:54.736
new level of functioning through the products that

912
00:40:54.736 --> 00:40:57.276
were made from the bodies of whales.

913
00:40:57.276 --> 00:40:59.716
It seems an enormous statement but,

914
00:40:59.716 --> 00:41:02.676
virtually all of the great port cities of the world

915
00:41:02.676 --> 00:41:04.536
were developed around whaling.

916
00:41:04.536 --> 00:41:07.976
The products of the body of the whale were everywhere.

917
00:41:07.976 --> 00:41:10.856
Just as today we live in what you might call a

918
00:41:10.856 --> 00:41:13.576
petrochemical culture around the world.

919
00:41:13.576 --> 00:41:16.456
Everything is being supported and made and fueled

920
00:41:16.456 --> 00:41:19.996
lubricated by petroleum, but that's only that's a

921
00:41:19.996 --> 00:41:21.476
recent history.

922
00:41:21.476 --> 00:41:23.866
That began in 1858.

923
00:41:23.896 --> 00:41:26.976
That's the first time a well was ever drilled in the earth,

924
00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:29.916
intentionally to draw oil out to use it for things.

925
00:41:29.916 --> 00:41:32.916
For 600 years prior to that it'll have been the bodies

926
00:41:32.916 --> 00:41:35.316
of whales and dolphins that have provided us with

927
00:41:35.316 --> 00:41:37.398
virtually the same kinds of products.

928
00:41:37.398 --> 00:41:40.576
So there was an influence there.

929
00:41:40.576 --> 00:41:42.996
Now we can say wait a minute, that was just human beings

930
00:41:42.996 --> 00:41:44.896
just taking something...
<v Regina>Exploiting.</v>

931
00:41:44.896 --> 00:41:46.216
<v ->Exploiting.</v>

932
00:41:46.216 --> 00:41:48.416
I have a bit of a different take on that.

933
00:41:48.416 --> 00:41:51.756
But let's keep on moving up until now.

934
00:41:51.756 --> 00:41:54.616
We now have today, something we call

935
00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:56.256
the environment movement.

936
00:41:56.256 --> 00:41:58.116
This is something which has had a tremendous effect,

937
00:41:58.116 --> 00:42:01.016
not only in America, not only in the developed countries

938
00:42:01.016 --> 00:42:03.516
but even in the, so to speak, undeveloped countries

939
00:42:03.516 --> 00:42:04.636
around the world.

940
00:42:04.636 --> 00:42:06.776
The idea of becoming sensitive to the world in

941
00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:08.116
which we live.

942
00:42:08.116 --> 00:42:10.636
Well what is the history of that movement?

943
00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:14.196
I would say arguably the beginnings of Green Peace,

944
00:42:14.196 --> 00:42:16.976
as an organization was what really first brought it

945
00:42:16.976 --> 00:42:19.156
to the attention of people around the world.

946
00:42:19.156 --> 00:42:21.656
And what was it that Green Peace first did?

947
00:42:21.656 --> 00:42:24.436
They went out and tried to stop whaling.

948
00:42:24.436 --> 00:42:28.137
They put themselves literally in small rubber boats

949
00:42:28.137 --> 00:42:31.196
between a Russian whaling fleet, and some whales.

950
00:42:31.196 --> 00:42:33.557
Maybe this will start to bring up an image in your mind.

951
00:42:33.557 --> 00:42:35.196
You probably remember this.

952
00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:38.316
And when that happened, people sat up and said

953
00:42:38.316 --> 00:42:41.776
wait a minute, there are human beings, right now

954
00:42:41.776 --> 00:42:45.406
willing to risk their own lives to save a whale?

955
00:42:46.056 --> 00:42:47.596
What's that about?

956
00:42:47.596 --> 00:42:50.036
Well this begin to capture people's imagination,

957
00:42:50.036 --> 00:42:53.356
it took us outside of the superior importance of

958
00:42:53.356 --> 00:42:54.816
the human being.

959
00:42:54.816 --> 00:42:57.596
We begin to see that something else was important.

960
00:42:57.596 --> 00:43:01.156
This is now evolved into our recycling campaigns,

961
00:43:01.156 --> 00:43:03.716
and our attempts to preserve and protect lands,

962
00:43:03.716 --> 00:43:05.316
the cleaning up of rivers;

963
00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:08.176
all of these kinds of sensitive issues that we have now.

964
00:43:08.176 --> 00:43:10.916
So can we say that the whales had an influence in that?

965
00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:12.496
I think very directly.

966
00:43:12.496 --> 00:43:15.836
And even today, whales and dolphins could be seen as

967
00:43:15.836 --> 00:43:18.236
sort of the canary in the coal mine.

968
00:43:18.236 --> 00:43:20.416
You know the old story of the miners who would take

969
00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:22.216
a canary down and watch the canary.

970
00:43:22.216 --> 00:43:24.496
If the canary died in the cage, they knew there were

971
00:43:24.496 --> 00:43:27.116
poisonous gases in the mine they had to get out of there.

972
00:43:27.116 --> 00:43:29.336
<v Regina>Speaking of beaching etcetera,</v>

973
00:43:29.336 --> 00:43:30.256
as well?
<v ->Exactly.</v>

974
00:43:30.256 --> 00:43:33.196
So we've got these issues now of enormous numbers of

975
00:43:33.196 --> 00:43:35.452
dolphins and whales being literally driven out of the

976
00:43:35.452 --> 00:43:38.912
ocean by the sounds that are being poured into the ocean.

977
00:43:38.912 --> 00:43:42.092
We as humans don't know this directly, but the

978
00:43:42.092 --> 00:43:44.331
oceans are suffering from extraordinary

979
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:46.392
sonic pollution these days.

980
00:43:46.392 --> 00:43:49.612
And some of it is being directed in ways which,

981
00:43:49.612 --> 00:43:51.891
absolutely does not need to be happening;

982
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:54.012
and it is terribly destructive to the whales and

983
00:43:54.012 --> 00:43:57.592
dolphins who live in a primarily sonic environment.

984
00:43:57.592 --> 00:44:01.291
And beyond that we've got runoff issues where

985
00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:03.812
you got habitat destruction which is killing fish,

986
00:44:03.812 --> 00:44:06.432
it's killing reefs, and thereby affecting the

987
00:44:06.432 --> 00:44:07.952
whales and dolphins.

988
00:44:07.952 --> 00:44:10.292
Let me point our another little piece of

989
00:44:10.292 --> 00:44:13.552
what the affect of our relationship with whales and

990
00:44:13.552 --> 00:44:15.112
dolphins has had.

991
00:44:15.112 --> 00:44:17.651
In ancient traditions they talk about the whales

992
00:44:17.651 --> 00:44:20.111
being the creators of the breath of the planet

993
00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:22.272
and the keepers of the breath of the planet.

994
00:44:22.272 --> 00:44:24.631
A very nice and a poetic idea.

995
00:44:24.631 --> 00:44:26.851
You see the great plumes coming out of them as they

996
00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:29.051
rise to surface and you think, oh okay that's where

997
00:44:29.051 --> 00:44:30.652
their idea came from.

998
00:44:30.652 --> 00:44:33.012
But let's take a moment and look at where

999
00:44:33.012 --> 00:44:36.031
does most of the planets oxygen come from.

1000
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:38.532
Now many of us think that the oxygen primarily comes

1001
00:44:38.532 --> 00:44:40.832
from the rain forest and the trees of the planet,

1002
00:44:40.832 --> 00:44:41.991
not true.

1003
00:44:41.991 --> 00:44:45.012
About one third of the world's oxygen comes from there.

1004
00:44:45.012 --> 00:44:48.292
The larger portion comes from what's called phytoplankton.

1005
00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:51.132
And phytoplankton are tiny, tiny little plants that

1006
00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:52.852
bloom in the oceans.

1007
00:44:52.852 --> 00:44:56.151
Okay phytoplankton grows in literally trillions of

1008
00:44:56.151 --> 00:44:59.212
tons, most of it south of the equator.

1009
00:44:59.212 --> 00:45:02.472
And when this stuff blooms, it gives off oxygen

1010
00:45:02.472 --> 00:45:03.672
into the air.

1011
00:45:03.672 --> 00:45:07.432
What feeds upon phytoplankton are called krill,

1012
00:45:07.432 --> 00:45:10.592
and krill are tiny little shrimp like creatures.

1013
00:45:10.592 --> 00:45:13.812
The krill eat the phytoplankton and help keep the

1014
00:45:13.812 --> 00:45:16.352
phytoplankton in a kind of balance so that it can bloom

1015
00:45:16.352 --> 00:45:18.812
again and its whole reproduction cycle.

1016
00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:22.292
The krill is the food of the great whales.

1017
00:45:22.992 --> 00:45:25.772
In the southern oceans, human beings have removed

1018
00:45:25.772 --> 00:45:29.462
up to 96 percent of those great whales.

1019
00:45:29.812 --> 00:45:33.012
So what happens then when you take the farmer

1020
00:45:33.012 --> 00:45:34.601
out of the farm?

1021
00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:38.151
If the southern oceans and the phytoplankton blooms

1022
00:45:38.151 --> 00:45:41.692
are so to speak the oxygen farm of the planet,

1023
00:45:41.692 --> 00:45:44.912
and you disturb that cycle, profoundly

1024
00:45:44.912 --> 00:45:48.001
you will have affected the global atmosphere.

1025
00:45:48.132 --> 00:45:51.132
As a matter of fact, what happens, the phytoplankton

1026
00:45:51.132 --> 00:45:53.412
will bloom in enormous amounts,

1027
00:45:53.412 --> 00:45:56.882
the krill have not been eaten and

1028
00:45:58.052 --> 00:46:01.072
gone through their cycle necessarily because the whales are

1029
00:46:01.072 --> 00:46:03.702
missing, so the whole thing starts to get completely

1030
00:46:03.702 --> 00:46:04.372
out of balance.

1031
00:46:04.372 --> 00:46:06.652
There'll be enormous phytoplankton blooms without

1032
00:46:06.652 --> 00:46:08.032
enough krill to eat it.

1033
00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:10.212
What happens then is the phytoplankton begins to

1034
00:46:10.212 --> 00:46:13.372
rot on the surface, it exhausts methane gas which

1035
00:46:13.372 --> 00:46:16.672
goes into the atmosphere and it thins the ozone layer.

1036
00:46:16.672 --> 00:46:19.732
Plus it adds to other atmosphere conditions.

1037
00:46:19.732 --> 00:46:22.772
So part of what we're seeing in terms of global warming

1038
00:46:22.772 --> 00:46:25.932
is a direct result of our having taken so many whales

1039
00:46:25.932 --> 00:46:27.232
out of the system.

1040
00:46:27.232 --> 00:46:30.072
We're moving the farmer from the oxygen farm.

1041
00:46:30.072 --> 00:46:32.792
Now they have, because whales and dolphins have been

1042
00:46:32.792 --> 00:46:36.902
doing what they do on the planet for 30 million years.

1043
00:46:37.112 --> 00:46:39.992
About 50 million years ago is when they made their

1044
00:46:39.992 --> 00:46:41.812
apparently conscious choice.

1045
00:46:41.812 --> 00:46:43.192
The legend of the Golden Dolphin said it was a

1046
00:46:43.192 --> 00:46:46.152
conscious choice, to move back into the oceans.

1047
00:46:46.152 --> 00:46:48.312
They went through a long evolutionary period,

1048
00:46:48.312 --> 00:46:51.152
but for 30 million years, they've been doing just what

1049
00:46:51.152 --> 00:46:52.452
they're doing now.

1050
00:46:52.452 --> 00:46:55.432
In 30 million years they've figured out how to manange

1051
00:46:55.432 --> 00:46:57.712
things, how to take care of things.

1052
00:46:57.712 --> 00:47:00.192
So this is one area, where they've been managing

1053
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:02.092
the oxygen source of the planet.

1054
00:47:02.092 --> 00:47:04.172
Are they the keepers of the breath of the planet?

1055
00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:06.034
Well obviously they are.

1056
00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:09.572
So the effect that we have is not only mythological,

1057
00:47:09.572 --> 00:47:12.792
and a spiritual, and even an emotional and physical

1058
00:47:12.792 --> 00:47:16.272
effect in terms of the healing that they offer us,

1059
00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:19.632
but there are also an incredibly and integral part

1060
00:47:19.632 --> 00:47:21.852
in the whole living system of the planet.

1061
00:47:21.852 --> 00:47:24.392
This is not an emotional issue, which the

1062
00:47:24.392 --> 00:47:26.512
Japanese and the Norwegians are attempting

1063
00:47:26.512 --> 00:47:27.952
to make that argument.

1064
00:47:27.952 --> 00:47:31.132
In their attempt to retain their supposedly traditional

1065
00:47:31.132 --> 00:47:35.252
rights to harvest the whales, they say all the rest

1066
00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:37.352
of the cultures of the world, they're just emotionally

1067
00:47:37.352 --> 00:47:38.912
caught up in these animals.

1068
00:47:38.912 --> 00:47:40.652
Why should we pay any attention to that?

1069
00:47:40.652 --> 00:47:41.972
We have other needs.

1070
00:47:41.972 --> 00:47:44.232
Well as a matter of fact it's not an emotional issue

1071
00:47:44.232 --> 00:47:47.242
primarily, it's an issue of global survival.

1072
00:47:48.192 --> 00:47:51.293
<v Regina>As the founder of the Citations Study Institute</v>

1073
00:47:51.293 --> 00:47:53.953
what do you intend to do about this next?

1074
00:47:53.953 --> 00:47:55.943
Where does your road go?

1075
00:47:56.013 --> 00:48:00.373
Well the latest form that my work has taken is called

1076
00:48:00.373 --> 00:48:01.953
the Dolphin Embassy.

1077
00:48:01.953 --> 00:48:04.673
This is an idea that was first come up with some years

1078
00:48:04.673 --> 00:48:07.273
ago by some people in Australia.

1079
00:48:07.533 --> 00:48:10.033
The two primary people who have developed that idea

1080
00:48:10.033 --> 00:48:12.633
have since died and it was quite extraordinary for

1081
00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:16.043
me to realize that the day that I went to the Australian

1082
00:48:16.413 --> 00:48:19.633
registry office to register a non profit organization

1083
00:48:19.633 --> 00:48:22.253
called the Dolphin Embassy was in fact the very day

1084
00:48:22.253 --> 00:48:24.753
that the final person died who had originated the

1085
00:48:24.753 --> 00:48:26.913
idea, I found this out later.

1086
00:48:26.913 --> 00:48:31.093
This is a mission, so to speak, to help remind

1087
00:48:31.093 --> 00:48:34.033
people of the importance of the dolphin and the

1088
00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:35.773
whale in our history.

1089
00:48:35.773 --> 00:48:39.513
Part of the work includes the fact that in the 1980s

1090
00:48:39.513 --> 00:48:41.913
it was a tremendous upsurge in our awareness

1091
00:48:41.913 --> 00:48:44.433
of dolphins, suddenly they became quite popular.

1092
00:48:44.433 --> 00:48:47.913
Begin seeing the kind of artifacts and artwork you saw.

1093
00:48:47.913 --> 00:48:51.033
You saw lots of stories being written and films being made.

1094
00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:54.693
So in a sense that was like a gift that was given to us

1095
00:48:54.693 --> 00:48:57.673
that we said ah this is beautiful, we paid attention to

1096
00:48:57.673 --> 00:48:59.793
it for a while then we put it on the shelf;

1097
00:48:59.793 --> 00:49:01.333
and said well what other gifts are out there

1098
00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:04.173
because many gifts are being opened up right now?

1099
00:49:04.173 --> 00:49:06.813
And this is one that has perhaps been put aside for

1100
00:49:06.813 --> 00:49:08.013
a little bit too long.

1101
00:49:08.013 --> 00:49:10.833
We need to remember that we share this planet with

1102
00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:14.253
extraordinary beings who have so much to offer us.

1103
00:49:14.253 --> 00:49:16.913
We could call them the successful life forms

1104
00:49:16.913 --> 00:49:19.493
this planet has ever produced.

1105
00:49:19.493 --> 00:49:22.193
No dolphin has a hard time figuring out how to

1106
00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:23.513
be a dolphin.

1107
00:49:23.513 --> 00:49:25.773
But how many human beings, are struggling with the

1108
00:49:25.773 --> 00:49:27.993
issue of how to be a human?

1109
00:49:27.993 --> 00:49:30.393
How to be successful, how to be sustainable,

1110
00:49:30.393 --> 00:49:33.233
how to be loving and kind and full of the celebratory

1111
00:49:33.233 --> 00:49:34.633
joy of life?

1112
00:49:34.633 --> 00:49:36.913
And when we wanna see a model of that, we need

1113
00:49:36.913 --> 00:49:38.593
only look to the dolphins.

1114
00:49:38.593 --> 00:49:40.233
If we look beyond this world,

1115
00:49:40.233 --> 00:49:43.651
if we look to the ET's, the ascended masters, the angels

1116
00:49:43.651 --> 00:49:46.351
and ask for them to come and to help us in our lives,

1117
00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:48.271
they may or may not come.

1118
00:49:48.271 --> 00:49:50.531
In the meantime while you're waiting, you can

1119
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:53.531
always go down to the shore and commune with a dolphin.

1120
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:55.111
You can simply watch them.

1121
00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:57.111
You don't need to swim with them, you don't need

1122
00:49:57.111 --> 00:49:59.511
to touch them, you don't need to be in a swim

1123
00:49:59.511 --> 00:50:02.911
program somewhere and maybe dissapointed by the

1124
00:50:02.911 --> 00:50:06.271
the process that the trainers are asking you to go through.

1125
00:50:06.271 --> 00:50:08.311
You can contemplate the dolphin.

1126
00:50:08.311 --> 00:50:11.621
And in doing so you will contact that spirit.

1127
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:15.291
So if we recognize that the earth is not really

1128
00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:16.831
properly called earth.

1129
00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:19.131
We should probably call this Oceania because

1130
00:50:19.131 --> 00:50:20.971
more than two thirds of the planet is covered

1131
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:23.331
with the ocean as you said.

1132
00:50:23.331 --> 00:50:26.289
Well who are the enlightened citizens of that nation?

1133
00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:27.729
The whales and dolphins.

1134
00:50:27.729 --> 00:50:30.249
So we could that the citation nation.

1135
00:50:30.249 --> 00:50:33.969
So the Dolphin Embassy then is our work to

1136
00:50:33.969 --> 00:50:37.089
bring to awareness among human beings

1137
00:50:37.089 --> 00:50:39.529
as much as possible, that we share this earth

1138
00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:43.389
with an enlightened, extraordinary kind of creature,

1139
00:50:43.389 --> 00:50:46.509
who has gifts for us now, and has always given us

1140
00:50:46.509 --> 00:50:48.729
everything that we've needed, the be the human

1141
00:50:48.729 --> 00:50:50.739
beings that we really want to be.

1142
00:50:51.979 --> 00:50:55.207
<v Regina>So if your journey and your story is written into</v>

1143
00:50:55.207 --> 00:50:58.707
the greater legend of the Golden Dolphin,

1144
00:50:59.257 --> 00:51:01.613
what is next or

1145
00:51:01.613 --> 00:51:04.333
where are we headed with that again

1146
00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:07.793
and just in brief where are we headed with that?

1147
00:51:07.793 --> 00:51:11.674
<v ->Well ideally we will see dolphin assisted therapy</v>

1148
00:51:11.674 --> 00:51:13.674
expand tremendously.

1149
00:51:13.674 --> 00:51:16.354
The field of inter species communication still has

1150
00:51:16.354 --> 00:51:18.114
tremendous promise.

1151
00:51:18.114 --> 00:51:20.714
And we've just found some people in Florida just a

1152
00:51:20.714 --> 00:51:23.274
few weeks ago who appear to be making an

1153
00:51:23.274 --> 00:51:26.074
extraordinary breakthrough into new understandings

1154
00:51:26.074 --> 00:51:28.374
of what the dolphins are actually saying.

1155
00:51:28.374 --> 00:51:31.874
They've got an organization called speak dolphin dot com.

1156
00:51:31.874 --> 00:51:34.194
And by all means go and visit their website and take

1157
00:51:34.194 --> 00:51:35.794
a look at what they're doing.

1158
00:51:35.794 --> 00:51:38.254
They're using the latest technology, things that have only

1159
00:51:38.254 --> 00:51:41.314
been released in the last six months to be able to look

1160
00:51:41.314 --> 00:51:44.774
at dolphins sounds in such high resolutions;

1161
00:51:44.774 --> 00:51:46.974
that we're beginning to discover that what we thought

1162
00:51:46.974 --> 00:51:50.414
were simple and intense sounds are in fact

1163
00:51:50.414 --> 00:51:52.774
enormous songs.

1164
00:51:52.774 --> 00:51:55.514
Every little burst of sound a dolphin makes is an

1165
00:51:55.514 --> 00:51:58.314
entire stack of chords of sound.

1166
00:51:58.314 --> 00:52:00.454
And we've only been able with high technology

1167
00:52:00.454 --> 00:52:03.114
to begin to look at what that means.

1168
00:52:03.114 --> 00:52:05.174
We believe that there is language there.

1169
00:52:05.174 --> 00:52:07.234
We believe that there are effects that with it our

1170
00:52:07.234 --> 00:52:11.074
being created by the dolphins are encoded by that language.

1171
00:52:11.074 --> 00:52:13.394
So inter species communication is another area we're

1172
00:52:13.394 --> 00:52:16.534
gonna go, I think in a very exciting way in the

1173
00:52:16.534 --> 00:52:17.974
next few years.

1174
00:52:18.664 --> 00:52:21.334
The legend of the Golden Dolphin and the work of

1175
00:52:21.334 --> 00:52:26.214
John Lilly, together suggests that there can be

1176
00:52:26.214 --> 00:52:29.254
and should be, and I'm very much in favor of this,

1177
00:52:29.254 --> 00:52:30.854
a children's movement.

1178
00:52:30.854 --> 00:52:33.194
And that children's movement would ask the

1179
00:52:33.194 --> 00:52:35.794
community of nations to declare peace between

1180
00:52:35.794 --> 00:52:38.854
the people of the land and the people of the sea.

1181
00:52:38.854 --> 00:52:40.814
And I mean the people of the sea.

1182
00:52:40.814 --> 00:52:43.334
So I have had a vision in my mind I've been very

1183
00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:47.194
fond of, of bringing together and providing opportunity

1184
00:52:47.194 --> 00:52:50.074
for children around the world to represent what it is

1185
00:52:50.074 --> 00:52:53.044
their dream of a future world would be like.

1186
00:52:53.214 --> 00:52:55.195
I would love to see them come together under the

1187
00:52:55.195 --> 00:52:57.624
banner and the sponsorship of the Citation Nation.

1188
00:52:57.894 --> 00:53:01.114
And I have this picture of a wave of children walking

1189
00:53:01.114 --> 00:53:04.394
across the plaza in front of the United Nations building

1190
00:53:04.394 --> 00:53:07.334
and a young boy and young girl each carrying a scroll.

1191
00:53:07.334 --> 00:53:09.134
And have them walk up to the front door of the

1192
00:53:09.134 --> 00:53:11.494
United Nations and knock on the door and an adult comes

1193
00:53:11.494 --> 00:53:14.944
and opens the door and these two children present this

1194
00:53:14.944 --> 00:53:18.324
scroll, on which is written the dream of the children of the

1195
00:53:18.324 --> 00:53:20.954
world for the world they would like to see.

1196
00:53:22.724 --> 00:53:24.134
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1197
00:53:24.584 --> 00:53:28.224
(soft music)

1198
00:53:28.224 --> 00:53:30.864
For the full story on Scott's journey with dolphins

1199
00:53:30.864 --> 00:53:33.104
and whales you might also want to pick up a copy

1200
00:53:33.104 --> 00:53:35.484
of his book, Souls of the Sea:

1201
00:53:35.484 --> 00:53:38.164
Dolphins, Whales, and Human Destiny.

1202
00:53:38.164 --> 00:53:40.564
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1203
00:53:40.564 --> 00:53:44.759
(soft music)
