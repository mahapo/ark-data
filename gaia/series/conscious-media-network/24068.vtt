00:00:00.811 --> 00:00:02.644
<v ->Do you remember the joy and freedom of playing</v>

2
00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:04.424
in the sand when you were a kid?

3
00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:06.604
Perhaps you even brought some of your favorite little toys

4
00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:09.604
to the beach and placed them around your sand castle.

5
00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:11.924
Well, believe it or not, you were accessing a

6
00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:13.584
deep part of the mind.

7
00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:16.884
Recently I had the pleasure of experiencing this again,

8
00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.504
not at the beach, but in Paula Petrovic's office

9
00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:22.564
where she guides people in sand play for the soul.

10
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.679
The experience is incredibly freeing and revealing,

11
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.459
as well as just plain fun.

12
00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:29.799
She says she's worked with everyone from children

13
00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.079
with night terrors to grieving mothers to

14
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.129
powerful executives.

15
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Regina>First of all I want to thank you because</v>

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.620
you allowed me to have a little session doing

17
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.140
sand play with you, and it was just not only charming,

18
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.320
but also revelationary.

19
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
And I think from what I can tell and what I've read

20
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.380
in your book and what I've experienced is that

21
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.920
it seems as though you're offering a playful and

22
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.720
safe way for people to access really profound

23
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.060
subconscious information.

24
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.900
So how did this come into your practice

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.740
as an individual and family counselor?

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.400
<v ->Well, it's an interesting story.</v>

27
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.842
I've been in the field for over 27 years, but at the time in

28
00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:24.480
the early 90's, I had been in the field for about 14 years,

29
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.562
and I happened to run into a lady in Hawaii

30
00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:30.283
who was from Sedona.

31
00:01:30.283 --> 00:01:32.743
And when she heard I was from Sedona she said,

32
00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:37.743
"Could you babysit a box of my personal items for me?"

33
00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:40.203
And I said, "Sure."

34
00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:45.203
Then she decided to stay in Hawaii, and then she asked,

35
00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:47.363
"Well, could you just pack some things and

36
00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:48.503
"send it to me?

37
00:01:48.503 --> 00:01:50.872
"The rest just pack and send to my mother."

38
00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:53.432
So in there was a book by a lady called

39
00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:55.739
Doris Kalff on sand play.

40
00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:59.859
I read the introduction, and I was absolutely mesmerized.

41
00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.659
And also in that box were some miniatures.

42
00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.112
So at the time I was married to a really wonderful man

43
00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.972
who actually sponsored me for many years with my work,

44
00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:12.412
and he had left this really funky studio.

45
00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:14.872
And I said, "I have to live here."

46
00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:17.952
I didn't know why, so when I read the introduction

47
00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:22.520
to this incredible book, I was in love.

48
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.360
And so I said I have to go on an experimental journey

49
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.588
because I really knew nothing about sand play

50
00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:29.068
or sand play therapy.

51
00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:32.088
So I went on my journey for a few years and had some of

52
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:34.628
the most amazing clients.

53
00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:39.528
And one was a little Tibetan boy who was reported to be

54
00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:43.428
a first companion of an important future Lama.

55
00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:47.701
And so he went into the sand tray, and he went to

56
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.035
different timelines, multiple realities.

57
00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:53.615
He just went to town, he was in love,

58
00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:56.895
and I was looking at how all of this stuff came through.

59
00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:59.375
And then right after that I had another little boy

60
00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:03.215
who actually had horrendous nightmares for the first,

61
00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.435
after the age of one for four years straight he had

62
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.675
horrendous nightmares, and he could not sleep

63
00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:08.875
through the night.

64
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.775
When the mom and him came in, both of them were

65
00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:12.495
ready for a nervous breakdown.

66
00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:16.835
He walked to my sand tray, and he, it was like he went

67
00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:20.575
into this other world, and he went to town dealing with

68
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.695
the demons that were keeping him awake at night.

69
00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:24.235
He had these night terrors.

70
00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:27.575
And he just went to town, and it was amazing

71
00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.047
the journey he went on.

72
00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:32.794
And then after that I came across a lady who was

73
00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:35.894
a heavy smoker, and she wanted to quit smoking.

74
00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:39.414
And after one session she found out why she was

75
00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:42.534
smoking three packs a day, got the connection.

76
00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:45.494
And what I heard from her afterwards she stopped smoking.

77
00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:47.734
And there was a series of these kind of events

78
00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:50.054
the first year that I was just experimenting

79
00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:51.615
using sand play.

80
00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:54.635
And after that I knew there was something profound

81
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:57.535
happening in the sand tray, and that people were able to

82
00:03:57.535 --> 00:04:00.635
talk to their souls, or that knowing place,

83
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:03.015
that place that I say has all the answers,

84
00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:05.715
it's a place of knowing that we often don't tap into.

85
00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:10.035
When a person goes to, speaks with that place in

86
00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:13.915
three-dimensional form by creating scenes in the sand tray,

87
00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:17.935
the doors that open in their mind, body and spirit,

88
00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:19.635
I'm still in awe to this day.

89
00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:22.275
I don't know how it happens, but something totally

90
00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:23.855
opens for people.

91
00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.775
And it doesn't matter who you are, how old you are,

92
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.415
what your life situation, whether you're a scientist

93
00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:32.635
or a child dealing with night terrors, or a teacher

94
00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:35.135
or a housewife, it does not matter.

95
00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:38.155
Everybody has this place, and there is something magical

96
00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:41.315
about the sand tray, as you've had a taste the other day.

97
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.515
<v Regina>No, it is absolutely magical, and first of all,</v>

98
00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:46.135
it's a real relief to come in and see a lot of your

99
00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.495
childhood favorite images, and it immediately takes you

100
00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:52.655
into this place of joy.

101
00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:55.655
I think that's number, now I don't know.

102
00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:58.515
I mean, if you're drawing a lot of really dark

103
00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:01.155
kind of images maybe it's not so much joy as familiarity,

104
00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:03.155
but it seemed to me to be very comforting

105
00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:06.755
and very joyful to be able to gather up these little images

106
00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:09.115
of familiar objects from the past.

107
00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.335
<v ->Well, it's actually interesting you brought out</v>

108
00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:12.575
about the dark energies.

109
00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:15.196
I had one client, a lady came in and she was in

110
00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:19.076
absolute terror even before she did her sand tray.

111
00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:21.116
And so I gave her permission that we didn't have to

112
00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:23.016
do anything if it was too frightening for her,

113
00:05:23.016 --> 00:05:25.036
but she says, well we talked for awhile,

114
00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:26.494
and she said, no I'm ready.

115
00:05:26.494 --> 00:05:29.675
So she started picking items, and when we started to do

116
00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:32.535
the facilitation and start the journey to see what this was

117
00:05:32.535 --> 00:05:35.142
all about for her, she says, "Oh, these miniatures

118
00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:36.862
"are really terrifying for me."

119
00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:39.082
And I said, "Well, do all the miniatures terrify you?"

120
00:05:39.082 --> 00:05:40.922
She goes, "Oh, no."

121
00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:42.462
She says, "This one is different."

122
00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:45.722
So we started to explore the miniatures that felt really

123
00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:49.282
comfortable with her, and as she started to explore those

124
00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.722
she started to stand up, feel empowered and

125
00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:53.062
not so frightened.

126
00:05:53.062 --> 00:05:55.542
And then from that place we started to look at the

127
00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:58.539
miniatures that she was scared of, and of course she said,

128
00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.479
"Why are these miniatures no longer scary?"

129
00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.859
And I says, "Because you came from your empowered place,

130
00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:05.638
"a place that's not fearful."

131
00:06:05.638 --> 00:06:07.818
So when you come from a non-fear place dealing with

132
00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:10.927
the fear versus coming from a place of fear and

133
00:06:10.927 --> 00:06:14.867
dealing with the fear, it's a whole different ball of wax.

134
00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:17.087
<v Regina>And I wanna get into some of the other</v>

135
00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:19.587
types of experiences you've had and types of people

136
00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:22.027
you've dealt with, but let's just back up a moment.

137
00:06:22.027 --> 00:06:25.087
Where did sand play originate?

138
00:06:25.087 --> 00:06:28.247
<v ->OK, sand play originated with a pediatrician</v>

139
00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:30.327
from England in the 1920's.

140
00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:34.207
She was part British and part Polish, and she went to

141
00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:37.907
war torn Poland and discovered that kids that were playing

142
00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:41.167
with sticks and stones in the sand seemed to regroup

143
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.527
and heal quicker from the trauma of war than kids

144
00:06:43.527 --> 00:06:44.907
who did not.

145
00:06:44.907 --> 00:06:46.967
So she says, "Ah, I've got an idea."

146
00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.927
So she moved from like pediatrics and started to get

147
00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:52.547
more in the counseling realm, and she discovered

148
00:06:52.547 --> 00:06:55.887
as they went on this journey that kids that got to

149
00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:59.867
express the terror and the fear that they got from war,

150
00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:02.067
and they got to put it out there in the sand tray,

151
00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.327
and deal with their demons, and then they were able to

152
00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:06.967
shift and move into a healthier place because

153
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.987
the place that I feel has all the answers helped them

154
00:07:09.987 --> 00:07:13.107
work through the trauma through the three-dimensional play.

155
00:07:13.107 --> 00:07:15.527
And then Jung came along a little later on,

156
00:07:15.527 --> 00:07:19.107
and he played with sand and to work through his issues.

157
00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:21.807
So it just kind of evolved into this whole thing,

158
00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:24.267
and then the Jungians got involved,

159
00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:27.627
but it started with this pediatrician in the 1920's.

160
00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:28.967
<v Regina>And are there many other people</v>

161
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:30.447
doing this at this time?

162
00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:33.887
<v ->Yeah, sand play therapy per se, there is a handful</v>

163
00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.147
of people scattered around.

164
00:07:35.147 --> 00:07:37.247
It's becoming more and more and more.

165
00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:40.907
I have taken it to a slightly different level.

166
00:07:40.907 --> 00:07:44.627
I don't do it so much for clinical and assessment.

167
00:07:44.627 --> 00:07:48.727
I leave that to the people that are really focused that way.

168
00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:52.327
I discovered sand play for the soul by bringing that

169
00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:55.927
other element that's always at work I feel in therapy,

170
00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:58.727
but this other element which I say the knowing place

171
00:07:58.727 --> 00:07:59.907
of the soul.

172
00:07:59.907 --> 00:08:03.007
That's just the words that came to me when I wrote the book,

173
00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:06.767
is that that place helps you take your awareness and knowing

174
00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:08.667
to yet a higher level.

175
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:13.447
And when all of the power within ourselves is behind

176
00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:14.507
the discovery, you get that much more information,

177
00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:18.450
which makes things go quicker.

178
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.510
<v Regina>So let's talk about some of the types of</v>

179
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.090
experiences and clients you've had.

180
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.930
You've mentioned a couple, but one in your book

181
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.950
that was interesting.

182
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.050
It was a pretty powerful man, macho,

183
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.990
macho superman guy
(Regina laughs)

184
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.490
<v ->Oh, you're talking about the corporate exec.</v>

185
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Regina>The one that wanted to leave as soon as</v>

186
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.650
he came in and saw he was sitting down with--

187
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.330
<v ->Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.
a bunch of little toys

188
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.230
and a woman, and he thought--
<v ->Yes, yes, yes, yes.</v>

189
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.350
no, this is stupid, I'm outta here.

190
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.940
<v ->Yeah.</v>

191
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.024
<v Regina>Tell us about that if you don't mind.</v>

192
00:08:42.024 --> 00:08:43.244
You don't have to name names obviously.

193
00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:46.224
<v ->Well, that's OK, the names in the book are totally--</v>

194
00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:47.724
<v Regina>Fictitious.</v>
fictitious.

195
00:08:47.724 --> 00:08:50.584
They're real people, but for privacy I did not

196
00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:51.924
use their names.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

197
00:08:51.924 --> 00:08:53.284
So let's talk about macho man.

198
00:08:53.284 --> 00:08:56.944
<v ->Yeah, Matt came in having really no idea what he had</v>

199
00:08:56.944 --> 00:08:58.184
gotten himself into.

200
00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:00.104
<v Regina>Now how did he even end up calling you?</v>

201
00:09:00.104 --> 00:09:03.784
<v ->He was connected with an organization that were organizing</v>

202
00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:07.944
some retreats in Sedona, and I happened to be one of his

203
00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:10.504
stops on this personal growth retreat that he had

204
00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:11.644
selected to do.

205
00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:12.864
<v Regina>So he didn't really know what it was.</v>

206
00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.064
<v ->He had no idea, and the woman who had organized it</v>

207
00:09:15.064 --> 00:09:16.764
didn't really say anything.

208
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:19.464
I guess she had an intuitive knowing not to tell this guy

209
00:09:19.464 --> 00:09:21.464
because he probably wouldn't have signed up.

210
00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:22.624
<v Regina>It sounds like he was ready to walk</v>

211
00:09:22.624 --> 00:09:23.584
when he got here.

212
00:09:23.584 --> 00:09:26.804
<v ->Well, yes he was because when he came inside he thought,</v>

213
00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:29.964
my god, there's all these miniatures and a sand tray.

214
00:09:29.964 --> 00:09:31.304
I'm gonna play in a sandbox?

215
00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.124
Me, a corporate executive?

216
00:09:33.124 --> 00:09:35.124
A high powered profile person?

217
00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:36.444
I don't think so.

218
00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:39.264
So fortunately I jumped into the humor part,

219
00:09:39.264 --> 00:09:42.124
which I do use a lot of humor, especially for people

220
00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:44.384
that are a little nervous because it's like what the heck

221
00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:45.924
are you getting me into?

222
00:09:45.924 --> 00:09:48.924
So fortunately something I said and did at the time

223
00:09:48.924 --> 00:09:51.464
helped him relax, and he gave himself permission

224
00:09:51.464 --> 00:09:52.904
to just go for it.

225
00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:55.104
And so the minute he started to really look at

226
00:09:55.104 --> 00:09:57.964
the miniatures this whole other part of him,

227
00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:01.364
a part of him that has always wanted to get his attention,

228
00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:05.424
which is the playful fun part, and being in his position,

229
00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:08.004
and also from his childhood background being someone

230
00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:11.144
who's had a lot of responsibilities as a young child,

231
00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:13.684
playing, letting go and having fun is just something

232
00:10:13.684 --> 00:10:15.325
that wasn't part of his world.

233
00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:18.005
Yet something inside was saying we need to really

234
00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:20.605
open that part of me, and he just somehow,

235
00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:23.845
and I think that knowing part is what really helped him stay

236
00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:26.465
after we did a little bit of talking.

237
00:10:26.465 --> 00:10:27.666
And so he went on a journey--

238
00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:29.506
<v Regina>Cajoling.</v>
Right, and he made some

239
00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:33.106
very powerful discoveries that he had a sense about,

240
00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:37.026
but seeing it in the three-dimensional reality just really

241
00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:40.486
anchored and said yes, that is what's going on with me.

242
00:10:40.486 --> 00:10:45.186
And that recognition opened this vast amount of emotions

243
00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:49.766
inside of him that had had him feeling really repressed,

244
00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:52.186
but then it just burst free, he released it,

245
00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:54.466
and then we went on this really fun journey.

246
00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:58.526
And he was absolutely shocked that playing in the sand

247
00:10:58.526 --> 00:11:03.286
for a little over an hour could reveal so much so quickly,

248
00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:06.186
and make him feel really connected to his soul.

249
00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:07.986
And of course, he didn't know me from Adam,

250
00:11:07.986 --> 00:11:10.806
so the fact that this could all happen in less than

251
00:11:10.806 --> 00:11:13.806
90 minutes was a surprise for him.

252
00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.926
So that's the real fun thing about sand play.

253
00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:17.206
You don't have to know me.

254
00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:19.186
You walk in, and your soul is right there,

255
00:11:19.186 --> 00:11:21.906
that knowing place, and it just goes and starts to

256
00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:24.606
play and create, and suddenly, it's that place where

257
00:11:24.606 --> 00:11:27.576
all the visionaries come from, and all the great

258
00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:29.157
visionaries and inventors.

259
00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:32.717
They come from that highly place of knowing.

260
00:11:32.717 --> 00:11:34.637
<v Regina>Highly intuitive where, you tell people</v>

261
00:11:34.637 --> 00:11:37.317
when they come in that you just start choosing.

262
00:11:37.317 --> 00:11:38.857
You just start putting them in a basket.

263
00:11:38.857 --> 00:11:40.817
You don't think about it, don't question it,

264
00:11:40.817 --> 00:11:43.197
just put them in a basket, the rest will be revealed.

265
00:11:43.197 --> 00:11:44.077
<v ->Exactly.</v>

266
00:11:44.077 --> 00:11:46.517
<v Regina>So it gives people permission to not be wrong--</v>

267
00:11:46.517 --> 00:11:48.207
<v ->Exactly, exactly.
in their choice.

268
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.869
Now I have a question on that whole subject.

269
00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:52.869
I was thinking about it, reflecting on it,

270
00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:56.909
that I set the intention to ask for what I need to know

271
00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:59.909
at this specific phase of my journey in life.

272
00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:02.109
<v ->Yeah, I do that with everybody when they first start.</v>

273
00:12:02.109 --> 00:12:04.309
<v Regina>And what happens if you,</v>

274
00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:08.209
can you see a very pronounced change say if I came back

275
00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:11.049
a week later, and I was in a little different frame of mind?

276
00:12:11.049 --> 00:12:13.569
Maybe had a different emphasis going on at that time.

277
00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:15.849
Would it be a different kind of reading for me,

278
00:12:15.849 --> 00:12:18.469
or would it have a lot of the same principal parts?

279
00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:20.049
<v ->Well, it would depend on what's up for you</v>

280
00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:21.209
at that moment in time.

281
00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:24.189
If you remember, what do I most need to know about

282
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:26.589
my life at this time, show me the way.

283
00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:28.629
So whatever is up for you at that moment.

284
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:30.449
For some it might be a carryover.

285
00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:34.009
There might be more pieces to that particular issue

286
00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:35.749
that you need to like focus on,

287
00:12:35.749 --> 00:12:38.509
or it could be a whole different ballgame.

288
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:41.029
For some it just takes them that much deeper

289
00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:43.969
to another level of awareness within themselves.

290
00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:46.949
It really, every person that walks through the door,

291
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:49.649
I do not have a preconceived idea what's gonna happen.

292
00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:53.489
It's literally as if their soul and my soul are

293
00:12:53.489 --> 00:12:55.989
communicating through the sand tray,

294
00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:58.069
and then we start to have a dialog.

295
00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.829
And it's the person's soul, the person themselves

296
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:03.489
that actually come up with all the answers,

297
00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:04.909
with all the awareness.

298
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.209
I merely facilitate and help pull the information out

299
00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:09.949
and help guide them on the journey.

300
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:14.549
But really it's their soul talking with my soul,

301
00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:17.609
but it's their soul that really answers and reveals

302
00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:20.149
whatever they need to have revealed.

303
00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:23.262
<v Regina>Can you give me a couple more examples</v>

304
00:13:23.262 --> 00:13:26.322
of some of the more profound things you've witnessed

305
00:13:26.322 --> 00:13:28.822
here in the sand tray among people?

306
00:13:28.822 --> 00:13:31.922
Some of your favorite, a couple of your favorite stories.

307
00:13:31.922 --> 00:13:36.722
<v ->One was a woman, and it's in my book, who lost her son</v>

308
00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:40.282
two years ago, and it sent her in such a profound,

309
00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:44.342
powerful place of grieving and loss that

310
00:13:44.342 --> 00:13:46.862
when it came to her to come to the studio she had actually

311
00:13:46.862 --> 00:13:48.942
almost turned into an alcoholic.

312
00:13:48.942 --> 00:13:52.022
She almost moved into full blown alcoholism,

313
00:13:52.022 --> 00:13:54.622
and part of her treatment program was coming for

314
00:13:54.622 --> 00:13:56.482
a sand tray session.

315
00:13:56.482 --> 00:14:00.562
And when she came in she said her son had come to her

316
00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:03.882
in a dream and said that he was gonna be with her

317
00:14:03.882 --> 00:14:05.202
during this session.

318
00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:08.762
It turned out that his energy and his connection to him

319
00:14:08.762 --> 00:14:11.662
kind of worked its way through and was part of

320
00:14:11.662 --> 00:14:13.202
the session with her.

321
00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:16.482
And so she had a dialog with her son

322
00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:18.642
symbolically through the sand tray,

323
00:14:18.642 --> 00:14:22.082
and it just moved her healing to a whole new level.

324
00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:25.362
And he gave her bits of wisdom and information

325
00:14:25.362 --> 00:14:28.342
that just helped, she'd already been on the road to healing

326
00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:30.142
because she was in this treatment program,

327
00:14:30.142 --> 00:14:33.302
but it added a few little extra pieces that really brought

328
00:14:33.302 --> 00:14:36.762
home to her where she needed to be now in her life,

329
00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:39.722
and that it was time for her to move beyond the grieving,

330
00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:42.022
and that she really felt that he was always

331
00:14:42.022 --> 00:14:43.722
gonna be present.

332
00:14:43.722 --> 00:14:48.722
Another very profound thing was there was this psychologist

333
00:14:50.302 --> 00:14:53.382
who was a drug and alcohol rehab person.

334
00:14:53.382 --> 00:14:54.482
<v Regina>Oh, interesting.</v>

335
00:14:54.482 --> 00:14:56.502
<v ->And he got lost in drugs and alcohol.</v>

336
00:14:56.502 --> 00:15:01.502
And from that session he tapped into a part of him

337
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:05.062
that had been totally shut down for many years.

338
00:15:05.062 --> 00:15:08.222
And the other part that took over was this deep void

339
00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:11.862
inside of him, and he hadn't given himself permission

340
00:15:11.862 --> 00:15:14.582
to tap into this part of him that could help him

341
00:15:14.582 --> 00:15:16.122
feel more complete.

342
00:15:16.122 --> 00:15:18.662
So when he tapped into it, and I won't give you the details

343
00:15:18.662 --> 00:15:21.222
'cause I don't wanna, you know, keep the story a surprise,

344
00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:25.342
you have to buy the book, but when he created,

345
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:29.222
he created two scenes, one from this very dark place,

346
00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:33.042
and then I was guided to give him permission to create it

347
00:15:33.042 --> 00:15:34.582
from this other part.

348
00:15:34.582 --> 00:15:37.602
So when this other part redid his scene, he moved to a

349
00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:40.742
whole other level of understanding within himself,

350
00:15:40.742 --> 00:15:44.142
and that healthy more actualized part helped him see

351
00:15:44.142 --> 00:15:47.142
what he was doing and realize where he really

352
00:15:47.142 --> 00:15:48.642
needed to be in life.

353
00:15:48.642 --> 00:15:51.382
And he had never, ever given himself permission

354
00:15:51.382 --> 00:15:54.202
to open this aspect of him, I think it was from

355
00:15:54.202 --> 00:15:56.182
the age of 12 or something,

356
00:15:56.182 --> 00:15:58.502
that after that he totally shut down.

357
00:15:58.502 --> 00:16:01.222
So he awakened, actually it was a 14-year-old boy

358
00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:04.762
inside of him, so he awakened that part,

359
00:16:04.762 --> 00:16:06.602
and it just moved him to a whole other level.

360
00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:08.762
The last I'd heard, but it's been a few years,

361
00:16:08.762 --> 00:16:12.482
he ended up, he was in total recovery and

362
00:16:12.482 --> 00:16:13.862
stayed in recovery.

363
00:16:13.862 --> 00:16:16.622
And he used aspects of what he learnt from here

364
00:16:16.622 --> 00:16:19.322
to incorporate it into his own counseling.

365
00:16:19.322 --> 00:16:21.122
<v Regina>And so the beauty of this is that because</v>

366
00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:23.762
it's coming from a deep childlike subconscious part

367
00:16:23.762 --> 00:16:26.262
of the being, it never lies.

368
00:16:26.262 --> 00:16:28.602
<v Paula>Never lies, absolutely.</v>

369
00:16:28.602 --> 00:16:32.042
I've never, I have done thousands of sand trays,

370
00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:35.842
and I've never seen a sand tray lie because that innocent

371
00:16:35.842 --> 00:16:39.122
pure place, the soul place, that innocent childlike place

372
00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:42.922
is so pure it needs to prove nothing to anyone,

373
00:16:42.922 --> 00:16:44.542
it just is.

374
00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:48.002
And in that just is place you're not affected by

375
00:16:48.002 --> 00:16:49.582
past preconditioning.

376
00:16:49.582 --> 00:16:51.602
You're not affected by future fears.

377
00:16:51.602 --> 00:16:54.982
If you look at children, they are very much in the moment

378
00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:56.902
and very spontaneous,

379
00:16:56.902 --> 00:16:58.942
at least for the early part of their life.

380
00:16:58.942 --> 00:17:01.282
So when you're in that place of knowing that's very

381
00:17:01.282 --> 00:17:04.062
spontaneous and just is, boom.

382
00:17:04.062 --> 00:17:07.002
it's the wisdom and the insight just phew,

383
00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:08.503
comes right through.

384
00:17:08.503 --> 00:17:10.603
And what better way, I think of this expression,

385
00:17:10.603 --> 00:17:14.083
a teaspoon of honey or sugar helps the medicine go down.

386
00:17:14.083 --> 00:17:15.223
<v Regina>Right, very true.</v>

387
00:17:15.223 --> 00:17:20.223
<v ->What a neat way to have fun but have revealing information</v>

388
00:17:20.263 --> 00:17:24.504
brought forth, and to do it in such a playful easy way.

389
00:17:24.504 --> 00:17:27.164
I mean, in this day and age what an exciting fun way

390
00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:29.804
to get information so quickly and easily

391
00:17:29.804 --> 00:17:31.624
and have fun at the same time.

392
00:17:31.624 --> 00:17:32.884
I mean, that's a concept.

393
00:17:32.884 --> 00:17:34.444
<v Regina>Yeah, that's a concept for you.</v>

394
00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:37.764
Everything's so serious and stressed around the world

395
00:17:37.764 --> 00:17:40.264
at the moment that it really is a very gentle,

396
00:17:40.264 --> 00:17:42.224
playful, wonderful relief.

397
00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:44.664
What about, OK, if a person were to pick up a copy

398
00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:46.564
of your book, order a copy of your book,

399
00:17:46.564 --> 00:17:49.344
and they read through it, would they be able,

400
00:17:49.344 --> 00:17:53.384
for example, to set up an environment in their own home

401
00:17:53.384 --> 00:17:55.504
to work with their own children?

402
00:17:55.504 --> 00:17:57.444
<v ->They could work with themselves.</v>

403
00:17:57.444 --> 00:18:01.514
The book is designed to do it for yourself.

404
00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:03.465
There may be, there will probably be another book where

405
00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:06.485
I'll get a little more in depth because it is a very

406
00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:09.005
powerful process, so you do want to be in a certain

407
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.365
frame of mind when you do it.

408
00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:14.485
But my experience is the soul never takes you

409
00:18:14.485 --> 00:18:16.285
where you're not ready to go.

410
00:18:16.285 --> 00:18:18.925
And what it does is whether kids do it with a mom,

411
00:18:18.925 --> 00:18:22.845
just has a kid work it through, I don't recommend that

412
00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:25.065
they analyze or do therapeutic.

413
00:18:25.065 --> 00:18:27.325
You really need to have a trained professional for that,

414
00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:29.605
but when you're talking with your soul,

415
00:18:29.605 --> 00:18:31.805
anybody has that right to talk with their soul,

416
00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:35.405
whether they do it in meditation, they do it through dance,

417
00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:38.605
or they do it through writing a book.

418
00:18:38.605 --> 00:18:40.165
It does not matter.

419
00:18:40.165 --> 00:18:42.945
I present opportunities for people to do a version of

420
00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:45.505
what I do with others for themselves,

421
00:18:45.505 --> 00:18:49.065
to allow that three-dimensionality through their

422
00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:51.145
knowing place to speak to them.

423
00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:53.125
And they don't even have to have a sand tray.

424
00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:56.685
It could be a sacred alter, it could be through journaling.

425
00:18:56.685 --> 00:18:59.325
I present alternatives to doing sand play,

426
00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:01.685
but if they are drawn to the sand, I mean they could even

427
00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:04.185
do it on the beach, they can do it in their garden.

428
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:07.885
How many people have special little areas in their house

429
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.905
where they have certain knick knacks that are

430
00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:12.905
very important and profound for them?

431
00:19:12.905 --> 00:19:15.525
I mean, it's like they can communicate with that

432
00:19:15.525 --> 00:19:16.666
part of themselves.

433
00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:17.886
I'll give you an example.

434
00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:22.566
There is a picture that, a photo of my godchild Olivia

435
00:19:22.566 --> 00:19:24.666
when she was one month old.

436
00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:28.706
And every time I look at that photo I,

437
00:19:28.706 --> 00:19:32.326
the innocence and purity within side of me is activated.

438
00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:34.806
And that is under the purity and innocence which is

439
00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:37.846
one of the sacred seven that I mention in my book.

440
00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:41.686
And I did a self tray before I actually wrote the book,

441
00:19:41.686 --> 00:19:44.706
and those sacred seven is actually what helped me

442
00:19:44.706 --> 00:19:46.566
write the book 'cause otherwise the book would have

443
00:19:46.566 --> 00:19:48.046
never get written.

444
00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:51.806
So parts of myself came forth through these sacred seven,

445
00:19:51.806 --> 00:19:55.586
and they came up with all kinds of fun spiritual wisdoms,

446
00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:59.026
idea, techniques, all kinds of things came forth

447
00:19:59.026 --> 00:20:02.266
through that sacred seven, and that part's in my book.

448
00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:05.606
So that picture, for example, someone may have a photo

449
00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:08.506
that is just, when they look at it they just feel,

450
00:20:08.506 --> 00:20:10.366
they feel the purity and innocence, you know,

451
00:20:10.366 --> 00:20:12.426
that mother-child bond.

452
00:20:12.426 --> 00:20:15.106
It's like, it just suddenly they can't help but be

453
00:20:15.106 --> 00:20:17.806
in that place when they look at that photo.

454
00:20:17.806 --> 00:20:20.846
So what would happen if you did a self-facilitation

455
00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:23.986
and brought information forth to give a more complete

456
00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:26.966
picture of who you are in the scheme of your life?

457
00:20:26.966 --> 00:20:31.546
So there's lots of stories in the book that just by osmosis

458
00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:33.986
of reading those stories you will automatically start to

459
00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:36.166
be able to open that dialog with yourself.

460
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:38.706
Plus there's a how-to component where I give

461
00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:41.866
specific examples on how you could start working with

462
00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.366
that energy for yourself,

463
00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:45.266
whether you use a sand tray or not.

464
00:20:45.266 --> 00:20:46.766
It does not matter.

465
00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:49.906
it's about opening the communication with your soul.

466
00:20:49.906 --> 00:20:53.286
When you do it from that quality of a three-dimensionality,

467
00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:56.086
we are living in a three dimensional world, you know,

468
00:20:56.086 --> 00:20:58.726
so it just helps anchor it more than when it's just

469
00:20:58.726 --> 00:21:00.366
in the abstract in our mind.

470
00:21:00.366 --> 00:21:04.346
It just brings concrete tangible expression for us,

471
00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.526
and it's easier to understand the mind from

472
00:21:06.526 --> 00:21:08.466
that place of three-dimensional.

473
00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:10.866
<v Regina>Right, and how many people don't enjoy</v>

474
00:21:10.866 --> 00:21:12.446
playing in the sand on the beach?

475
00:21:12.446 --> 00:21:15.086
I mean as a little kid, if anyone's ever been near sand,

476
00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:16.986
the first thing you do is you start making things

477
00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:19.646
and expressing your creativity through it.

478
00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:22.466
And developing that, it seems what you were saying

479
00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:25.146
a moment ago is, for example, looking at the little picture

480
00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:27.406
of your godchild Olivia,

481
00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:29.626
and it brought this great joy to you.

482
00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:34.046
Just that experience alone seems to me to be the

483
00:21:34.046 --> 00:21:38.406
sacred place to start creating your own desires from,

484
00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:40.986
just to have that inspired, and then go into the

485
00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:44.006
creative process from that innocence and joy.

486
00:21:44.006 --> 00:21:47.546
<v ->You're reading my mind because when you start sand play,</v>

487
00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:49.986
the purity and innocence, you right away start,

488
00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:52.106
I'm getting goose bumps now, you're right away

489
00:21:52.106 --> 00:21:55.706
starting from a clean slate, from that purity and innocence.

490
00:21:55.706 --> 00:21:59.126
And before you even create your sand tray scene

491
00:21:59.126 --> 00:22:00.926
that's what happens.

492
00:22:00.926 --> 00:22:03.866
People automatically are in that place.

493
00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:06.786
And then as they do, all doors open,

494
00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:09.126
and then you go on a journey because there's

495
00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:13.166
so many things we can be faulting ourselves for.

496
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:16.006
There's an expression, we can do nine things right

497
00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:16.926
and one thing wrong.

498
00:22:16.926 --> 00:22:18.466
What are we gonna focus on?

499
00:22:18.466 --> 00:22:21.026
Well, when you do a sand tray you focus on,

500
00:22:21.026 --> 00:22:24.106
you begin with a clean slate, and then everything,

501
00:22:24.106 --> 00:22:26.946
all kinds of journeys and all kinds of adventures

502
00:22:26.946 --> 00:22:28.327
become possible.

503
00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:30.647
And when you come from that innocent open place

504
00:22:30.647 --> 00:22:33.247
of knowing, which is the knowing place of the soul,

505
00:22:33.247 --> 00:22:37.207
that's how I experience it, when you come from that place

506
00:22:37.207 --> 00:22:40.287
it's like all kinds of answers can come forth

507
00:22:40.287 --> 00:22:41.707
so quickly and easily.

508
00:22:41.707 --> 00:22:45.687
And how often do we even allow ourselves that possibility?

509
00:22:45.687 --> 00:22:47.587
<v Regina>Oh, very seldom, we're so busy with</v>

510
00:22:47.587 --> 00:22:50.167
ticking off our little tasks lists in life.

511
00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:53.327
Whether it's a vacation or work or house cleaning,

512
00:22:53.327 --> 00:22:55.287
it's always a to do list.

513
00:22:55.287 --> 00:22:57.127
<v ->Yeah, and the feeling, the guilt, the shame,</v>

514
00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:59.427
everything we carry forth that holds us back from

515
00:22:59.427 --> 00:23:02.087
becoming the bigger picture of who we are.

516
00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:03.847
None of that's in the sand tray.

517
00:23:03.847 --> 00:23:05.927
I mean, issues do come up, don't get me wrong,

518
00:23:05.927 --> 00:23:08.107
like this lady had tremendous fear,

519
00:23:08.107 --> 00:23:09.447
but that's real for people.

520
00:23:09.447 --> 00:23:11.707
But boy, if you can put that in the sand tray

521
00:23:11.707 --> 00:23:14.687
and transmute that and move it to a higher place

522
00:23:14.687 --> 00:23:17.367
of evolvement where you move beyond the shame,

523
00:23:17.367 --> 00:23:19.487
and you really see what really happened,

524
00:23:19.487 --> 00:23:21.367
and it's nothing what you thought it was,

525
00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.987
and what really happened actually absolves you

526
00:23:23.987 --> 00:23:26.767
and allows you to really move into a place of truth.

527
00:23:26.767 --> 00:23:28.927
And when you're in that place of truth you can quickly

528
00:23:28.927 --> 00:23:32.167
resolve those kinks in your life that have caused you

529
00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:33.667
a lot of pain.

530
00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:35.647
And there are some stories in there that are kind of

531
00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:39.467
heavy duty stories, but at the end they are so powerful

532
00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:42.907
and wonderful, that people come through really dark places,

533
00:23:42.907 --> 00:23:45.687
and they move to this higher place of awareness they never

534
00:23:45.687 --> 00:23:47.907
even thought was possible because the pain was

535
00:23:47.907 --> 00:23:51.067
so big in them, but when they really saw what was

536
00:23:51.067 --> 00:23:54.367
really going on and what that pain was really about,

537
00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:58.067
bam, they just instantly shifted to a whole other place.

538
00:23:58.067 --> 00:24:00.437
I mean, what is that worth?

539
00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:03.087
<v ->For those of you who are intrigued but can't make it</v>

540
00:24:03.087 --> 00:24:05.887
to a sand tray, you can also pick up a copy of her book

541
00:24:05.887 --> 00:24:07.767
titled Sand Play for the Soul.

542
00:24:07.767 --> 00:24:10.197
Until next time, thanks for watching.
