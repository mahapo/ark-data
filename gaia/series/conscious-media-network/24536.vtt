00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.848
<v ->I can think of no better way to begin a health program</v>

2
00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:06.148
than listening to the words of the renowned raw food author,

3
00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:07.188
David Wolfe.

4
00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:09.388
David exemplifies the work that he does,

5
00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:12.386
radiating good health, energy and passion.

6
00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:14.366
He explains in this interview the nature

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.126
of natural raw foods and their healing abilities

8
00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.166
along with those from the herb kingdom,

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.816
raw chocolate and more.

10
00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:22.722
He says once you get rolling on a light

11
00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.259
and color-filled diet, your dietary choices become easy

12
00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.870
and the weight falls off.

13
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.836 line:15% 
(bright electronic music)

14
00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:39.728
We've seen the world of nutrition go through a lot

15
00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:42.806
of evolution, starting with your advertisements for Geritol

16
00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:45.354
in the 1950s and 60s, too.

17
00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:49.662
Really, through high protein, high carbohydrate,

18
00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.702
vegetarian, classic vegetarian, vegan

19
00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:53.378
and here we are with you.

20
00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:55.908
So, can you give us an idea of the history,

21
00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:57.314
give us a little historical perspective

22
00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:00.622
on what's happened with food and why it's ended up here.

23
00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:04.106
<v ->Well, we tried better living through, (laughs)</v>

24
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.024
we tried better living through chemistry,

25
00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.384
we tried better living through antibiotics,

26
00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:10.684
we tried better living through hormone injections

27
00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:14.244
into factory-farmed animals, we tried better living through,

28
00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:17.500
basically, a poisoned ecosystem, and it didn't work

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.160
and we ended up with more obesity now than ever before,

30
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.458
we've got more frustration with diets now than ever before,

31
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.656
with all the stuff we have available,

32
00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:28.068
all the diet technology we have available.

33
00:01:28.068 --> 00:01:29.168
<v Voiceover>Total confusion.</v>

34
00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:31.528
<v ->Total confusion and chaos!</v>

35
00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.948
And what we really do with living foods is we just,

36
00:01:34.948 --> 00:01:38.418
we bring an anchor in under all that

37
00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:42.284
so we can be anchored and finally get our direction

38
00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:44.820
and our destiny in alignment.

39
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.498
This is really the power of living foods

40
00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:49.374
'cause it's very common sense-based.

41
00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:51.274
With all the different theories about diet,

42
00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:54.674
all the different conflicting ideas,

43
00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:55.879
how are we gonna make sense of it?

44
00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:59.819
Well, I think we have to go back to intuition or instinct,

45
00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.319
and really tune in to what our common sense is telling us.

46
00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.319
Every creature on the planet eats a living food diet.

47
00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.777
We are the only ones who disturb our food in any way,

48
00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:14.293
and not only that, we disturb our food in an extreme way.

49
00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.149
I mean all the way to microwaving,

50
00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.927
and I mean, what is going on, you know?

51
00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:22.965
Processed sugar to the max, hydrogenated oil to the max,

52
00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:25.819
factory farming, et cetera, et cetera.

53
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.427
So to me it's almost like a cosmic giggle.

54
00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:32.607
I mean it's absolute dietary madness out there,

55
00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:35.101
and what we represent is just the simple approach.

56
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:38.081
Let's just add, very important word,

57
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.859
add living foods to our diet,

58
00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.800
which means raw plant food, essentially.

59
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.959
It's a lot easier to sneak up on lettuce

60
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:45.857
than it is a rabbit.

61
00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:46.635
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:49.729
<v ->That's gotta be the basis of our original diet.</v>

63
00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.947
People say, "Oh my god, primates are eating meat!

64
00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:53.265
"They're tearing monkeys apart!"

65
00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:54.523
blah blah blah, and it's like,

66
00:02:54.523 --> 00:02:57.118
well, let's look at the other 98% of what they're doing,

67
00:02:57.118 --> 00:03:00.296
or 99% of what they're doing, which happens to be plants.

68
00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.432
<v Voiceover>Well, also, they can travel at speeds</v>

69
00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.408
up to 60 miles an hour and have claws and fangs. (laughs)

70
00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:06.786
<v ->Yeah, and look at us,</v>

71
00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.024
I mean, we could barely walk down the street anymore.

72
00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:09.742
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

73
00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:11.602
<v ->And so, this whole thing about, you know,</v>

74
00:03:11.602 --> 00:03:14.180
humans are, you know, the naked ape-killer,

75
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.640
ape and all that stuff, is actually a disturbed

76
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.618
theory created by eating a diet that is not really natural

77
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.178
and has nothing to do with what's normal,

78
00:03:24.178 --> 00:03:25.938
and now we're kind of getting back

79
00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:29.078
into the real understanding

80
00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:31.978
of the most popular phrase in the world,

81
00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.556
which is "You are what you eat."

82
00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:37.016
You are what you eat crosses all barriers,

83
00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:40.376
all cultural lines, all language,

84
00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.756
every single culture throughout all of history

85
00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.534
has had that phrase in their language,

86
00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:47.312
and the reason is is because I think, personally,

87
00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:49.850
that that was the Zip file we got

88
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.628
when we were emailed to the planet.

89
00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:53.726
<v Voiceover>Right, exactly, good way to put it.</v>

90
00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.018
<v ->You know, so we got something and that was it.</v>

91
00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.472
<v Voiceover>Well, why is it seeming so complicated</v>

92
00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.912
to plug back into such a basic reality for us,

93
00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:04.792
aside from, we know the programs that are running out there

94
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:06.872
in terms of advertising media,

95
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:10.371
the cultural programs trying to suck us into more

96
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:12.583
products that have a long shelf life, shall we say.

97
00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:15.664
<v ->Yeah, we've got to unwind ourselves out</v>

98
00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:19.003
and that is a, it's an emotional process,

99
00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:22.404
and it's psychological, and it's social.

100
00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:24.243
These are the main factors about food.

101
00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:25.484
It's not really physical.

102
00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:26.660
It's mostly emotional.

103
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.320
People eat for emotional reasons,

104
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.859
and so unwinding out those behaviors

105
00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:35.419
and actually bringing in food that is 100% good for you,

106
00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.736
that is high in nutrients, massively high in minerals

107
00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:42.150
and vitamins and enzymes, and low in calories,

108
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.327
I mean, that's how you lose weight.

109
00:04:43.327 --> 00:04:44.003
You wanna lose weight?

110
00:04:44.003 --> 00:04:45.238
Eat celery all day.

111
00:04:45.238 --> 00:04:46.618
Eat a cucumber all day.

112
00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:48.753
Eat apples, eat oranges,

113
00:04:48.753 --> 00:04:50.653
things that are natural and normal,

114
00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:53.214
and what happens is the weight just comes right off.

115
00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:56.729
In the world of living food, it's very common at any event

116
00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.744
that I do to have anywhere from two to six people

117
00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:02.445
in the audience who've lost over 100 pounds

118
00:05:02.445 --> 00:05:04.925
without trying, without suffering,

119
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:07.784
without guilt, without fear, without shame,

120
00:05:07.784 --> 00:05:11.044
without having to use willpower, essentially,

121
00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:15.225
and that is, that's shocking news, really.

122
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:17.056
I mean, every event I do, I'll say,

123
00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:18.951
"How many people here have lost over a hundred pounds?"

124
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.370
And there'll be two, three, four, five, six people out there

125
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.945
that say, "Yeah, I have."

126
00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:24.151
And I say, "Yeah, how'd you do it?"

127
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:25.368
and here's how they did it.

128
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:28.449
You just add living foods in your diet.

129
00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.943
The whole spectrum of living foods,

130
00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.458
not just lettuce, not just watermelon.

131
00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Voiceover>Can I just do salads and make it work?</v>

132
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.225
<v ->Yeah, I mean, after a while, you go salad-crazy.</v>

133
00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:38.439
I mean, I've done that,

134
00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.159
salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner,

135
00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.180
for weeks and weeks and months and months.

136
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.095
I mean, you just go completely nuts,

137
00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:46.131
or bananas, or you go plum crazy,

138
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.457
or whatever the metaphor you wanna use.

139
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:53.203
There's a tremendous cornucopia of living foods

140
00:05:53.203 --> 00:05:55.583
that we can add into our diet at any time,

141
00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:59.682
and they can be better than organic, or at least organic,

142
00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:02.918
they can be more fun than we were formerly allowed

143
00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:04.633
to have with food,

144
00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:07.310
they can be extremely nutritious,

145
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.904
at a level of nutrition we've never even known before,

146
00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:13.704
we never even had it in our whole existence, our whole life!

147
00:06:13.704 --> 00:06:17.656
That's what's available now, and what we add in,

148
00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:19.667
again, using that word, add, because people are like,

149
00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:21.463
"You mean I can't have

150
00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:22.275
"A, B,
<v Voiceover>Cupcakes?</v>

151
00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:24.442
<v David>"C, D, E, F, G."</v>

152
00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:26.619
You know, if we get into that game,

153
00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.658
like you can't have this, what ends up happening

154
00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:33.299
is we get into denial, willpower, battling ourselves, guilt.

155
00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:35.679
That's a losing game, nobody wins that game.

156
00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:37.419
We lose, everybody loses.

157
00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.659
If we get into what people really want,

158
00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:42.854
which is novelty, taste sensations,

159
00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:45.789
fun, unique experiences,

160
00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.730
then we line up the food that supports that,

161
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.630
which is raw fruits and vegetables,

162
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.969
raw nuts and seeds,

163
00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:56.950
raw seaweeds,

164
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.469
raw organic sprouts,

165
00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.749
grasses like wheatgrass juice,

166
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:06.549
herbs, the greatest herbs in the entire world,

167
00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:09.469
and an incredible category of foods

168
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.226
that we've really pioneered in the last 20 years,

169
00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:13.186
which is superfoods,

170
00:07:13.186 --> 00:07:15.922
a group of foods that are really loaded,

171
00:07:15.922 --> 00:07:17.897
I mean, that have got a lot of bang for the buck.

172
00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:20.257
Now if we add those things in,

173
00:07:20.257 --> 00:07:21.972
we can start going "Whoa!"

174
00:07:21.972 --> 00:07:25.571
instead of having some kind of whey protein glue

175
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:26.957
going into our morning shake

176
00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:31.017
with some kind of salmonella-infested egg or whatever.

177
00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.045
We can then say, "Here, let me just put a little bit of this

178
00:07:33.045 --> 00:07:34.216
"in there, I'll throw a little bit of that in there,

179
00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:35.551
"I'll throw my fruit juice in there,

180
00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:37.810
"blend the whole thing up, get the blueberries in there,"

181
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.251
and walk out the door with a zing, with a level of nutrition

182
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.924
that's probably greater than most Americans

183
00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:48.321
actually get in a week, or even sometimes a month,

184
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.341
right there in one blenderful.

185
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:52.750
I mean this is how simple we can make living foods

186
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.790
for people now.

187
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.821
So it doesn't have to be a complicated recipe book,

188
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:57.056
although I love that stuff,

189
00:07:57.056 --> 00:07:59.012
I mean I love complicated raw food recipes

190
00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:01.466
and I'll eat that if it's made with love

191
00:08:01.466 --> 00:08:02.946
any day of the week.

192
00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:05.658
I'll have a vegetable juice any day of the week

193
00:08:05.658 --> 00:08:09.178
but my goal is to make it as easy as possible

194
00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:12.113
for someone to get from point A to point Z.

195
00:08:12.113 --> 00:08:12.888
<v Voiceover>So you have somebody</v>

196
00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:14.463
who's living on a processed diet,

197
00:08:14.463 --> 00:08:16.299
what is the first thing you tell them?

198
00:08:16.299 --> 00:08:17.955
Where do they begin this journey?

199
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.535
It's unique to the person.

200
00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:20.990
It depends on what they're into.

201
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.670
For example, I can go to somebody and say,

202
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.600
"Hey, you should get into vegetable juice,"

203
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.856
because I can tell that they like playing with food a lot,

204
00:08:27.856 --> 00:08:29.095
and they're a kitchen person,

205
00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:30.732
and they just will start juicing celery,

206
00:08:30.732 --> 00:08:32.831
they'll juice carrots, cucumbers, lemons,

207
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:34.747
apples, everything's going down that juice machine

208
00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:37.047
and they can do it and it's fun for them.

209
00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:39.674
Now for me, personally, I'm not that type of person.

210
00:08:39.674 --> 00:08:41.880
I'm so busy with what I'm doing that, like,

211
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.291
I'll drink a vegetable juice any day of the week

212
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:45.851
as long as it's organic and freshly made.

213
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:46.767
<v Voiceover>And someone's made it. (laughs)</v>

214
00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:47.861
<v ->And someone's made it with love</v>

215
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.457
but, you know, I'm not gonna clean the juicer.

216
00:08:49.457 --> 00:08:49.933
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

217
00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:50.679
<v ->That's just how it works.</v>

218
00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:51.656
<v Voiceover>Right, so what do you do?</v>

219
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.231
So you're a busy, on-the-go person and--

220
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:54.883
<v ->So I do everything in a blender,</v>

221
00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:56.182
and so what I do is I,

222
00:08:56.182 --> 00:08:57.799
that could be somebody else's personality.

223
00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:59.535
They might go, "I can blend stuff

224
00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:01.291
"but juicing, sorry, can't do it," so we go,

225
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.350
OK, in that case, we go,

226
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.846
"Let's focus everything on the blender,"

227
00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:05.640
so we get everything in there.

228
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.136
We get the blueberries in there,

229
00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:09.012
we can cut up kiwis, throw that in there,

230
00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:10.568
we can throw raspberries in there,

231
00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:12.264
we can throw blackberries in there,

232
00:09:12.264 --> 00:09:15.698
and then instead of that heinous whatever protein powder,

233
00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:17.858
which is really coming from factory farms

234
00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.975
and loaded with gelatin and just literally,

235
00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:23.686
the most awful pesticides ever, (mumbles) awful,

236
00:09:23.686 --> 00:09:26.063
we can just go, "OK, that's gone

237
00:09:26.063 --> 00:09:27.538
"and here's what's coming in, boom!"

238
00:09:27.538 --> 00:09:29.848
and we just bring in a whole bunch of superfoods,

239
00:09:29.848 --> 00:09:32.889
goji berries, raw chocolate, cacao beans.

240
00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:33.800
<v Voiceover>I was gonna get around to that</v>

241
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.306
because you're big on that right now

242
00:09:35.306 --> 00:09:36.275
and that,
<v David>That's the big one.</v>

243
00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.869
now you're catching people, so that emotional eating thing,

244
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:41.065
"Oh, cacao, that sounds like chocolate to me."

245
00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:43.039
<v ->How about eating chocolate without guilt?</v>

246
00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.274
How about having the best food ever all the time?

247
00:09:45.274 --> 00:09:48.570
I mean, how about getting into such alignment with our food

248
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.749
that every time we eat, it's an ecstatic experience,

249
00:09:51.749 --> 00:09:54.690
and we never have to worry about calories

250
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.125
or what time we're eating, or who we're eating with,

251
00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:00.565
or any of that ever again.

252
00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:04.520
That just goes all into the ash bin of history, literally.

253
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.185
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

254
00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:05.754
<v ->That's all gone now.</v>

255
00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:06.493
<v Voiceover>That's fabulous.</v>

256
00:10:06.493 --> 00:10:09.592
<v ->See, this is all a technological innovation,</v>

257
00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:11.022
really, is what it is.

258
00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:12.046
What's a technology?

259
00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:14.446
It's a way of doing more with less.

260
00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:15.644
That's technology,

261
00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:17.084
and so what we've figured out now

262
00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:21.244
is how do we actually get what we really want with food,

263
00:10:21.244 --> 00:10:25.444
the emotional component, the fun, the novelty, the flavor,

264
00:10:25.444 --> 00:10:28.424
and have no side effects,

265
00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:31.002
and lose the weight with these without trying,

266
00:10:31.002 --> 00:10:34.762
right, without willpower, and as an answer to that question

267
00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:36.882
comes the living food diet,

268
00:10:36.882 --> 00:10:39.282
the superfood diet,

269
00:10:39.282 --> 00:10:42.100
the chocolate miracle diet,

270
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.698
essentially.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

271
00:10:42.698 --> 00:10:43.314
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

272
00:10:43.314 --> 00:10:45.177
<v ->You know, all that stuff, you suddenly, there it is.</v>

273
00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.461
<v Voiceover>Even in Eating for Beauty,</v>

274
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:49.261
I mean, this extends inside to outside.

275
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:50.781
That's what people don't understand.

276
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:51.175
<v ->Yeah.</v>

277
00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:54.125
<v Voiceover>I mean, women spend hundreds of dollars</v>

278
00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:56.975
a year, certainly, even a month in some cases,

279
00:10:56.975 --> 00:10:58.553
to try to make beautiful skin

280
00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:00.291
in a beautiful package on the outside.

281
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:04.191
In fact, it's the blueberries, it's the living foods,

282
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:07.251
it's the herbs, really, that is making people like you

283
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:10.030
and others that are very healthy like that beautiful.

284
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.927
<v ->Yeah, you just stop aging, too.</v>

285
00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:13.065
That's another side effect.

286
00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:14.565
You stop aging, your skin,

287
00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:15.803
I mean, I look at the back of my hands

288
00:11:15.803 --> 00:11:17.823
and they're exactly the same as they were

289
00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:19.380
when I was 16 years old.

290
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.938
Exactly the same, I haven't aged one day.

291
00:11:20.938 --> 00:11:21.794
<v Voiceover>I don't know how old you are</v>

292
00:11:21.794 --> 00:11:23.272
but you do have 16-year old hands,

293
00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:24.390
and I know you're not 16.

294
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:24.906
<v ->Yeah, I'm not 16. (laughs)</v>

295
00:11:24.906 --> 00:11:25.997
<v Voiceover>You've done too much in the world</v>

296
00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:27.474
to be 16. (laughs)

297
00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:29.868
<v ->I've been around the sun now 37 times.</v>

298
00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:31.223
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Wow.</v>

299
00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:33.578
<v ->I literally, interestingly enough,</v>

300
00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:35.858
in 1989, I broke my back,

301
00:11:35.858 --> 00:11:39.479
and I literally could not do a push up for 10 years,

302
00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:42.673
and I couldn't actually do any kind of pushing at all,

303
00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:44.594
even pushing a broom, literally,

304
00:11:44.594 --> 00:11:47.274
without pain for about two and a half years,

305
00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:49.769
and I couldn't sleep on my side for two and a half years.

306
00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:50.424
I mean,
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

307
00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:52.664
<v David>I went through that level of an injury.</v>

308
00:11:52.664 --> 00:11:54.965
Every doctor, every chiropractor,

309
00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:57.545
every alternative healer said it's a mechanical problem,

310
00:11:57.545 --> 00:11:59.965
you are not gonna able to fix it, blah blah blah.

311
00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:04.064
Well, with living foods, superfoods, herbs and yoga,

312
00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:05.480
I am completely well now.

313
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.128
I can do anything and to me, that is a miracle

314
00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:10.939
because I lived in a situation

315
00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.248
of being in pain non-stop for years

316
00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:15.234
and there are people out there right now

317
00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.534
who, a woman came to me yesterday just like that,

318
00:12:17.534 --> 00:12:20.755
had been in pain everyday for seven years,

319
00:12:20.755 --> 00:12:22.875
and I said "There is hope for you,

320
00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.289
"there is a solution out there for you."

321
00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:27.306
And we just give her a few tools and she was on her way

322
00:12:27.306 --> 00:12:31.706
but that, I'm not speaking because it's an idea or a theory.

323
00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:33.639
That's my experience, I know, actually,

324
00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.815
how to heal that kind of injury.

325
00:12:34.815 --> 00:12:37.731
<v Voiceover>Right, well, let's get into the notion of,</v>

326
00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:39.154
I want to ask you something really quickly,

327
00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:40.108
when you're making your smoothies,

328
00:12:40.108 --> 00:12:43.184
how do you feel about raw nut milk?

329
00:12:43.184 --> 00:12:44.460
Making your own raw nut milk,

330
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.930
I love making that milk.
<v David>Absolutely.</v>

331
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.586
<v Voiceover>I love it.</v>

332
00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:47.562
<v ->Nut milk is great.</v>

333
00:12:47.562 --> 00:12:49.158
I mean, we can go through the whole cornucopia,

334
00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:50.578
right, we've got fruits,

335
00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:51.633
you can with that any way you want.

336
00:12:51.633 --> 00:12:54.193
You can eat the fruit whole, you can make juices out of it,

337
00:12:54.193 --> 00:12:57.553
you can press it, get the juicy goodies out of it,

338
00:12:57.553 --> 00:12:59.614
all that stuff, and when it's living,

339
00:12:59.614 --> 00:13:02.534
when it's raw, it has all its enzymes intact.

340
00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:03.009
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

341
00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:05.681
<v ->It has its water, living water intact.</v>

342
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:07.051
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about enzymes for a sec.</v>

343
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.448
Why is this so important?

344
00:13:08.448 --> 00:13:10.428
We're not getting enough in our diet anymore.

345
00:13:10.428 --> 00:13:11.333
Why is it so important

346
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:13.323
to reintroduce enzymes alone?

347
00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:14.978
<v ->I believe it was Dr. Edward Howell</v>

348
00:13:14.978 --> 00:13:18.393
who did the most work in Western literature

349
00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:21.129
in informing us that enzyme depletion

350
00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:23.264
is a major cause of aging,

351
00:13:23.264 --> 00:13:25.599
and if we're eating living food,

352
00:13:25.599 --> 00:13:28.860
raw fruits, raw vegetables, raw nuts and seeds,

353
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.634
raw seaweed, et cetera,

354
00:13:30.634 --> 00:13:32.489
what happens is we actually get those enzymes,

355
00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:33.644
they're in the food.

356
00:13:33.644 --> 00:13:36.319
Even dried herbs contain active enzymes

357
00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:38.819
that once they hit water or hit your digestive system,

358
00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:40.119
they become active.

359
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.539
Now if those herbs have been cooked,

360
00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:43.659
those enzymes are no longer active.

361
00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.979
Those enzymes are catalysts, and they help

362
00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:50.299
with the cascade of metabolic events

363
00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:52.199
that occurs when we're digesting food

364
00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.219
or when we've been injured,

365
00:13:54.219 --> 00:13:55.794
or when we're attempting to heal ourself

366
00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.474
of a long-standing chronic condition, et cetera,

367
00:13:58.474 --> 00:14:02.194
and they essentially, over time, lighten the burden

368
00:14:02.194 --> 00:14:05.734
or the load that our pancreases are performing,

369
00:14:05.734 --> 00:14:07.404
that our liver is performing,

370
00:14:07.404 --> 00:14:09.444
that our circulatory system is performing,

371
00:14:09.444 --> 00:14:12.105
and they just make things a little bit easier

372
00:14:12.105 --> 00:14:14.499
and it's a cumulative effect.

373
00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:17.014
This is why somebody can eat junk food for 30 years

374
00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:19.610
and then suddenly, boom, it hits them.

375
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.105
You can get away with it for a while,

376
00:14:21.105 --> 00:14:23.020
but then one day, it's time to pay the piper.

377
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.140
There's a little bean counter in there somewhere.

378
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Voiceover>Right, you've used up those chips. (laughs)</v>

379
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.183
<v ->Yeah, and once you use those up,</v>

380
00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:29.437
but the great thing about it,

381
00:14:29.437 --> 00:14:31.747
and this is where I actually disagree with Dr. Howell,

382
00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:33.702
is that once you do get onto living food

383
00:14:33.702 --> 00:14:35.677
and you get those enzymes back in your food,

384
00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:37.152
you're eating all of your food raw

385
00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:39.367
or at least a good portion of it, at least 80%,

386
00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:40.443
that's our goal, really,

387
00:14:40.443 --> 00:14:42.897
to get people up to 80% living food,

388
00:14:42.897 --> 00:14:46.013
then what happens is you start to actually put more cash

389
00:14:46.013 --> 00:14:47.912
in your enzyme bank account.

390
00:14:47.912 --> 00:14:49.919
You start building that account up and then all of sudden,

391
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.718
you propel yourself into a future

392
00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:55.653
with a little bit of reserves, and that's what we need.

393
00:14:55.653 --> 00:14:56.993
I mean, if something happens to you,

394
00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:58.068
you go through an emotional stress,

395
00:14:58.068 --> 00:14:59.968
you lose someone in your family,

396
00:14:59.968 --> 00:15:02.263
you go through an injury, something, a car accident,

397
00:15:02.263 --> 00:15:04.804
something like that, you need that bank account,

398
00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:07.783
and enzymes cannot be replaced from any other source

399
00:15:07.783 --> 00:15:10.839
than either living foods or enzyme supplements,

400
00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:11.466
and that's where we get that.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

401
00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Voiceover>How do you feel about enzyme supplements?</v>

402
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.516
<v ->They vary in quality, a lot.</v>

403
00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:16.306
<v Voiceover>Do you mind giving me,</v>

404
00:15:16.306 --> 00:15:18.621
because we don't have sponsors doing,

405
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:19.856
we're free, we can say what we want.

406
00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:20.231
<v ->OK.</v>

407
00:15:20.231 --> 00:15:21.701
<v Voiceover>What are two of your top enzymes,</v>

408
00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:23.057
your favorite enzymes?

409
00:15:23.057 --> 00:15:26.026
<v ->Well, my favorite enzyme is the enzyme that I developed</v>

410
00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.741
over a period of about six or seven years

411
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:29.401
called Beauty Enzymes,

412
00:15:29.401 --> 00:15:32.034
and the reason why we developed it along that way,

413
00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:34.694
what my expertise really is, in that field is,

414
00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:38.594
enzymes both help with digestion and metabolism.

415
00:15:38.594 --> 00:15:42.294
Now, in digestion, that means they help digest your food,

416
00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:43.870
so you take them with food.

417
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.510
Another part of that, the metabolic side is,

418
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.946
let's say you have a long-standing chronic condition,

419
00:15:48.946 --> 00:15:50.677
let's say you just wanna get younger.

420
00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:52.237
Let's say you have an injury,

421
00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:53.573
then you need metabolic enzymes.

422
00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:56.049
Well we've taken both the best of both those worlds

423
00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:58.104
and combined it into one formula.

424
00:15:58.104 --> 00:16:00.480
Now there are great enzymes in the digestive enzyme world,

425
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.495
lot of them, I mean, it's an endless--

426
00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:03.161
<v Voiceover>Many, OK.</v>

427
00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:03.882
<v ->Many.</v>

428
00:16:03.882 --> 00:16:06.017
There's great enzymes in the metabolic enzyme world

429
00:16:06.017 --> 00:16:08.394
like Vitalzym, like Wobenzym.

430
00:16:08.394 --> 00:16:08.789
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

431
00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:10.600
<v ->And what we've done is we just said,</v>

432
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.559
"OK, how can we take that and this and go like this,

433
00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:15.116
"and do it organic?"

434
00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:16.790
So our enzyme product, Beauty Enzymes

435
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.487
is a hundred percent organic product,

436
00:16:18.487 --> 00:16:21.047
and actually, we can't put that on the bottle

437
00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:23.942
because there's no organic enzyme certification.

438
00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:24.979
<v Voiceover>Yeah, gotcha.</v>

439
00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:26.772
OK, so, now when you're doing,

440
00:16:26.772 --> 00:16:28.813
say if you're eating live foods anyway,

441
00:16:28.813 --> 00:16:31.613
do you still take an enzymatic supplement?

442
00:16:31.613 --> 00:16:33.648
Do you need to do that or do you only do it

443
00:16:33.648 --> 00:16:36.565
if you're eating something that's been processed or cooked?

444
00:16:36.565 --> 00:16:37.461
<v ->That's a great question.</v>

445
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:39.817
I mean, do we need to take enzyme supplements

446
00:16:39.817 --> 00:16:41.167
when we eat processed or cooked food,

447
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.483
and the answer is probably, yes,

448
00:16:42.483 --> 00:16:44.559
it would be very helpful to do that.

449
00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:46.459
Do we need to take enzyme supplements

450
00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:48.017
if we're eating all living food?

451
00:16:48.017 --> 00:16:49.836
No, but it's helpful.

452
00:16:49.836 --> 00:16:52.133
It is helpful, and I feel,

453
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:53.331
like for me personally,

454
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:55.209
a woman came up and asked me the other day,

455
00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:56.805
she's like, "Are you ever in pain?"

456
00:16:56.805 --> 00:16:58.283
and I was, I thought about that

457
00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.983
and I had been in pain for years,

458
00:17:00.983 --> 00:17:04.523
but I've been so far out of that for so long,

459
00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:07.537
that I completely forgot that I was ever in pain

460
00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:11.435
and that question really stuck in my mind,

461
00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:13.411
and I thought, "I'm never in pain, ever."

462
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:13.829
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

463
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.265
<v ->For any reason, I never have sore muscles,</v>

464
00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:16.783
anything like that, but I believe

465
00:17:16.783 --> 00:17:17.921
that part of the reason that is

466
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:19.861
is because not only do I eat living food,

467
00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:22.178
but I also take enzyme supplements.

468
00:17:22.178 --> 00:17:24.295
<v Voiceover>And we're in an oxygen-deprived environment,</v>

469
00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:27.495
now that is the basis for our metabolic functioning,

470
00:17:27.495 --> 00:17:30.495
so if you're, wouldn't you say that that also helps overcome

471
00:17:30.495 --> 00:17:32.611
some of the deficiencies we're going through

472
00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:34.709
by being a sheerly oxygen-deprived planet?

473
00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.949
You can't make that stuff up unless you're on a machine.

474
00:17:36.949 --> 00:17:38.207
<v ->Absolutely, yeah.</v>

475
00:17:38.207 --> 00:17:40.045
We live in a disturbed atmosphere.

476
00:17:40.045 --> 00:17:41.523
<v Voiceover>A disturbed atmosphere on every level</v>

477
00:17:41.523 --> 00:17:44.121
but let's just start with the one thing we can't do without,

478
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:46.321
oxygen, so wouldn't this help?

479
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:48.821
<v ->Yes, it does, 'cause enzymes thin your blood out.</v>

480
00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:51.259
What they do is they magnetize each red blood cell

481
00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:53.299
and you can see this under a live microscope.

482
00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:56.479
You can give somebody a host of enzyme supplements,

483
00:17:56.479 --> 00:17:59.414
like say, eight to 10, several thousand milligrams

484
00:17:59.414 --> 00:18:00.693
of an enzyme supplement,

485
00:18:00.693 --> 00:18:02.791
and then watch their blood in a half hour

486
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.649
and you can see that their blood actually goes

487
00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:08.569
from being clumpy to being, the red blood cells separate out

488
00:18:08.569 --> 00:18:10.722
and have a little bit of a magnetic charge.

489
00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:11.758
Well you know what that means.

490
00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.494
That means the red blood cells can carry more oxygen.

491
00:18:13.494 --> 00:18:15.804
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, that's fabulous.</v>

492
00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.176
I wanna try (mumbles) I'm gonna try your Beauty Enzymes,

493
00:18:18.176 --> 00:18:19.933
that sounds great.

494
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.269
OK, so, we've got a little bit in there on that.

495
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.585
I wanna talk about the superfoods

496
00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:25.645
and most powerful herbs and then, ultimately,

497
00:18:25.645 --> 00:18:27.496
we've gotta get to cacao,

498
00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:28.804
chocolate. (laughs)
<v David>Yeah, yeah.</v>

499
00:18:28.804 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about superfoods</v>

500
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.216
and the most powerful herbs, what's going on there?

501
00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:35.836
<v ->I've been a live foodist for 13, 14 years now.</v>

502
00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:37.672
I mean, I have really been,

503
00:18:37.672 --> 00:18:41.072
I mean I've been eating only live food for over 13 years.

504
00:18:41.072 --> 00:18:45.288
So I'm so far into researching food for real,

505
00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:48.164
not some trumped up way where I read some article somewhere

506
00:18:48.164 --> 00:18:50.099
and then I'm reporting some disturbed information.

507
00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:51.795
<v Voiceover>No, you're well respected in your research.</v>

508
00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:53.690
<v ->Yeah, it's like I live it.</v>

509
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.322
You know, and I just wanna put that out there

510
00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:57.199
because a lot of people in the diet

511
00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:59.494
and nutrition world don't live it.

512
00:18:59.494 --> 00:19:01.714
They are not living examples of what they teach.

513
00:19:01.714 --> 00:19:04.805
They don't have the, whatever, the willpower,

514
00:19:04.805 --> 00:19:07.102
the discipline or whatever it takes to really, like,

515
00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:08.062
walk their talk.

516
00:19:08.062 --> 00:19:10.402
Now that age is over with, we're out of that now.

517
00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:12.208
Now we're on to a different program,

518
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:16.448
and in the living experience of being a live foodist,

519
00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.026
and being in the world that I'm in,

520
00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:24.026
I mean, I've done something like 1500 live performances,

521
00:19:24.026 --> 00:19:26.925
educational classroom experiences,

522
00:19:26.925 --> 00:19:30.044
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, over the last 13, 14 years,

523
00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:33.522
I have met every major live foodist in the whole planet

524
00:19:33.522 --> 00:19:34.922
from all different countries.

525
00:19:34.922 --> 00:19:37.140
I've had tremendous experience with people

526
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.936
who have actually healed themself of X, Y and Z.

527
00:19:39.936 --> 00:19:40.576
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

528
00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:43.291
<v ->So from all that, what I found is that living food</v>

529
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.930
is the basis, that's the base,

530
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.770
and that is a very important base for anybody,

531
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.510
and then, where we're really getting the real,

532
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.430
kind of, fine attunement

533
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.828
is with the most powerful herbs in the world,

534
00:19:57.828 --> 00:19:59.786
so the top 20 herbs in the world, which is,

535
00:19:59.786 --> 00:20:01.504
makes it easy 'cause that means you don't need to know

536
00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:03.620
what herb number 50 is or herb number 100,

537
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.198
or you don't need to know herb number 1,000.

538
00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:05.856
<v Voiceover>Off the top of your head,</v>

539
00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:08.054
give us a few of the top 20 most powerful.

540
00:20:08.054 --> 00:20:10.354
<v ->Goji berry, reishi mushroom, ginseng,</v>

541
00:20:10.354 --> 00:20:12.890
astragalus, He Shou Wu,

542
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.310
this is in the Chinese world.

543
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.870
In Ayurveda, it's say, Tulsi, Shatavari, Ashwagandha.

544
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.210
In Amazonia, it's the Camu berry,

545
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.850
it's the Pau d'arco bark, Chuchuhuasi bark,

546
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.246
Cat's Claw bark, and I could just go on indefinitely,

547
00:20:29.246 --> 00:20:31.286
and right there, I've listed over 10 herbs,

548
00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:35.346
and if you just did those 10 herbs, if you just did that,

549
00:20:35.346 --> 00:20:37.644
that would have a radical effect on your life,

550
00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:38.482
just doing that,

551
00:20:38.482 --> 00:20:40.098
having the discipline of doing that everyday.

552
00:20:40.098 --> 00:20:40.836
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

553
00:20:40.836 --> 00:20:42.294
<v ->The way we approach this, again,</v>

554
00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:44.568
it's very important that I restate this,

555
00:20:44.568 --> 00:20:46.006
that you add these things in.

556
00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:47.204
You don't change what you're doing

557
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.782
because it's my understanding,

558
00:20:48.782 --> 00:20:51.162
it's actually my belief now from what I've seen,

559
00:20:51.162 --> 00:20:54.100
that when you get on live food as a base as best you can,

560
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.200
when you get on to the most powerful herbs

561
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.880
and then superfoods, the intelligence of that food

562
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.840
does speak to your body, and it does cause changes to happen

563
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.360
inside your metabolism and in your consciousness

564
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.980
that make it easier and easier and easier

565
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.738
to make healthier choices,

566
00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:13.856
and environmentally friendly choices.

567
00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:17.856
In fact, you become, literally, an environmental warrior.

568
00:21:17.856 --> 00:21:22.156
You become like an example of the living solution,

569
00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:26.464
and that's an enormous part of this whole green movement.

570
00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:29.111
We could point all day about that's wrong, this is bad,

571
00:21:29.111 --> 00:21:29.689
this is the worst ever--

572
00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:31.247
<v Voiceover>We wanna just know where does it go from here.</v>

573
00:21:31.247 --> 00:21:31.845
<v ->Exactly.</v>

574
00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:32.403
<v Voiceover>We wanna go up.</v>

575
00:21:32.403 --> 00:21:33.481
<v ->We wanna go up, we don't need to worry</v>

576
00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:35.257
about pointing this, that. (mumbles)

577
00:21:35.257 --> 00:21:36.975
So what is the best message?

578
00:21:36.975 --> 00:21:39.295
To be a living solution,

579
00:21:39.295 --> 00:21:42.295
so that everything you wear is organic, is natural,

580
00:21:42.295 --> 00:21:45.653
all your jewelry is made by hand, by friends,

581
00:21:45.653 --> 00:21:48.272
where you don't use any kind of products on your body

582
00:21:48.272 --> 00:21:50.671
that are harmful, everything going in your body

583
00:21:50.671 --> 00:21:54.671
is literally an offering to the temple of your soul.

584
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:55.869
Literally, and I'm at a point

585
00:21:55.869 --> 00:21:57.807
where I've been doing this long enough,

586
00:21:57.807 --> 00:22:00.407
where I don't eat anything just haphazardly

587
00:22:00.407 --> 00:22:02.605
or I'm not halfway through a bag of whatever

588
00:22:02.605 --> 00:22:04.205
before realizing what's going on.

589
00:22:04.205 --> 00:22:06.103
I used to do that, though. (both laugh)

590
00:22:06.103 --> 00:22:07.507
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

591
00:22:07.507 --> 00:22:11.891
Everything's eaten with an intention and a goal with soul.

592
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.449
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

593
00:22:12.449 --> 00:22:13.165
<v ->That, that--</v>

594
00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.422
<v Voiceover>If you're talking about, essentially,</v>

595
00:22:14.422 --> 00:22:15.360
conscious living--

596
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.118
<v ->Conscious living--</v>

597
00:22:16.118 --> 00:22:16.834
<v Voiceover>On every level, though.</v>

598
00:22:16.834 --> 00:22:18.390
<v ->At every level, at every level,</v>

599
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.405
but my experience is, is that unless we get a grip on

600
00:22:21.405 --> 00:22:24.303
"You are what you eat," we ain't gonna get to the goal

601
00:22:24.303 --> 00:22:26.381
because this temple, this vehicle,

602
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:29.101
has got to be an embodiment of living solution

603
00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:31.699
or where are we gonna end up?

604
00:22:31.699 --> 00:22:33.815
<v Voiceover>Exactly, and people's argument is,</v>

605
00:22:33.815 --> 00:22:35.233
"Yeah, but we've never lived longer."

606
00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:37.413
Well, A, that's already starting to reverse itself

607
00:22:37.413 --> 00:22:40.233
and B, it doesn't mean that there's any quality of life.

608
00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:41.973
Yeah, you might have been hunted down

609
00:22:41.973 --> 00:22:43.752
by a saber-tooth and died young,

610
00:22:43.752 --> 00:22:45.247
but you were probably healthy and in good shape.

611
00:22:45.247 --> 00:22:46.003
<v ->You're probably, yeah.</v>

612
00:22:46.003 --> 00:22:47.097
<v Voiceover>When you died,</v>

613
00:22:47.097 --> 00:22:48.615
and that's not the case anymore.

614
00:22:48.615 --> 00:22:50.633
Most people live at least half of their life

615
00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:52.861
in kind of a chronic decline.

616
00:22:54.229 --> 00:22:57.027
<v ->The phrases people ask me, "Oh, but we're living longer,"</v>

617
00:22:57.027 --> 00:22:58.405
or they state it to me and I say,

618
00:22:58.405 --> 00:22:59.803
"No, we're not, we're dying longer."

619
00:22:59.803 --> 00:23:02.491
<v Voiceover>We're dying longer, that's very well put,</v>

620
00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:03.547
very well put.

621
00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:05.063
<v ->And this is another thing about live food.</v>

622
00:23:05.063 --> 00:23:08.399
It's about living, I mean, living to the max.

623
00:23:08.399 --> 00:23:10.495
I literally go everyday all day,

624
00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:12.011
sometimes I stay up for days in a row.

625
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:13.027
I mean, I do that all the time.

626
00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:14.533
The other day I stayed up the entire night,

627
00:23:14.533 --> 00:23:16.934
got up into San Francisco 4:30 in the morning,

628
00:23:16.934 --> 00:23:19.046
then got up at 8 and you know, fire,

629
00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:21.327
go on it, full on all day long.

630
00:23:21.327 --> 00:23:22.603
That's living.

631
00:23:22.603 --> 00:23:23.918
We don't need to be sleeping longer,

632
00:23:23.918 --> 00:23:25.578
we don't need to be watching TV longer,

633
00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:27.289
we need to be living longer,

634
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:29.729
and emphasis on living.

635
00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:30.800
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

636
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.516
(clears throat) Well, OK,

637
00:23:32.516 --> 00:23:35.807
I know that you got a lot to do here at this festival.

638
00:23:35.807 --> 00:23:38.083
I wanna find out about cacao before we go.

639
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.378
It's something that it's a little darling of yours right now

640
00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:42.578
and there's a lot of it at this show,

641
00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:45.358
and at one point, I look at it and I think,

642
00:23:45.358 --> 00:23:49.398
OK, but it's almost like it's going overboard on one level

643
00:23:49.398 --> 00:23:52.816
when you go to some of the booths, for example, here.

644
00:23:52.816 --> 00:23:54.792
It's almost too much of a statement of chocolate

645
00:23:54.792 --> 00:23:57.031
and organic coffee rather than living foods.

646
00:23:57.031 --> 00:24:00.238
Let's talk about the way you view chocolate, cacao.

647
00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:03.157
<v ->The way that, just to be perfectly frank</v>

648
00:24:03.157 --> 00:24:05.323
and honest with you, what actually caused

649
00:24:05.323 --> 00:24:07.397
this cacao revolution is that one night,

650
00:24:07.397 --> 00:24:10.072
I was in Maui and for years I'd gone to Hawaii

651
00:24:10.072 --> 00:24:11.267
and a friend of mine would give me a little bit

652
00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:12.820
of cacao beans, which is the food

653
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.176
that all chocolate's made out of.

654
00:24:14.176 --> 00:24:16.932
I had no idea what it was, so now it's called cocoa beans.

655
00:24:16.932 --> 00:24:18.788
You see it spelled different ways.

656
00:24:18.788 --> 00:24:20.463
Anyway, I didn't know what it was,

657
00:24:20.463 --> 00:24:22.160
but I said, "Well, what do I do?"

658
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.995
He just said, "Oh, just peel it, throw it in a smoothie."

659
00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:25.100
Well, I said, "OK, whatever."

660
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.476
So we started out with three, then it was 10,

661
00:24:26.476 --> 00:24:28.512
then it was 50, then it was a hundred.

662
00:24:28.512 --> 00:24:30.407
Next thing I know, we got like 300 cacao beans,

663
00:24:30.407 --> 00:24:31.503
I'm at a friend's house.

664
00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:33.299
This is about four or five years ago,

665
00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:36.075
and we're peeling cacao beans and throw it into a smoothie

666
00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:37.490
and then a friend of mine said,

667
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.351
"Hey, have you ever just eaten one?"

668
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:40.423
I said, "No,"

669
00:24:40.423 --> 00:24:44.379
and when I bit into the first cacao bean that I ate,

670
00:24:44.379 --> 00:24:46.535
the cacao god actually communicated with me.

671
00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:49.195
Instantaneously, it happened in a millisecond,

672
00:24:49.195 --> 00:24:51.768
and what I mean by the cacao god or the deva of the plant,

673
00:24:51.768 --> 00:24:53.728
the plant spirit, communicated with me,

674
00:24:53.728 --> 00:24:55.648
and basically said this.

675
00:24:55.648 --> 00:24:57.505
Look, you've been trying to convince people

676
00:24:57.505 --> 00:24:58.684
to drink wheatgrass.

677
00:24:58.684 --> 00:25:00.222
That's all good, it's the best ever,

678
00:25:00.222 --> 00:25:02.980
but you might only reach a few million people

679
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.218
with that message.

680
00:25:04.218 --> 00:25:07.538
If you get on board with me, you will touch the hearts

681
00:25:07.538 --> 00:25:09.036
of billions of people.

682
00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:09.815
<v Voiceover>It's true.</v>

683
00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:12.592
<v ->And that literally happened in instantaneous download</v>

684
00:25:12.592 --> 00:25:14.550
and I was like, "Whoa," and then,

685
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.308
I literally signed on the dotted line

686
00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:18.486
and I've been working with the cacao god ever since.

687
00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:19.664
<v Voiceover>Well, let's talk about it,</v>

688
00:25:19.664 --> 00:25:22.965
the actual constituents of it, the antioxidants,

689
00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:24.922
at what point it's still good for you

690
00:25:24.922 --> 00:25:27.218
and at what point it's not good for you.

691
00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:29.208
<v ->OK, well, for me personally,</v>

692
00:25:29.208 --> 00:25:30.734
the way that my research started,

693
00:25:30.734 --> 00:25:33.952
started that moment, that second when that happened,

694
00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:36.810
and that night, I stayed up all night researching chocolate.

695
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.728
I grabbed every book at my friend's house that he had

696
00:25:38.728 --> 00:25:40.688
that even touched on chocolate.

697
00:25:40.688 --> 00:25:42.962
It was a really synchronistic night

698
00:25:42.962 --> 00:25:44.780
of unparalleled proportions.

699
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.238
That began the research that became the book,

700
00:25:47.238 --> 00:25:49.108
Naked Chocolate.

701
00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:50.844
which I wrote with Shazzie, who was actually there

702
00:25:50.844 --> 00:25:53.079
when that incident happened, and she kind of

703
00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:56.374
is the living foods guru of the U.K.,

704
00:25:56.374 --> 00:25:58.350
kind of what I do in the U.S. and Canada,

705
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.570
she does over there,

706
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.186
and we put that book together,

707
00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:05.090
and it was literally...

708
00:26:06.157 --> 00:26:08.476
Where the research led was encapsulated

709
00:26:08.476 --> 00:26:10.353
by the subtitle of the book,

710
00:26:10.353 --> 00:26:14.756
"The astonishing truth about the world's greatest food".

711
00:26:15.305 --> 00:26:17.925
I get chills even thinking, I'm getting chills right now.

712
00:26:17.925 --> 00:26:19.763
What chocolate really is

713
00:26:19.763 --> 00:26:23.043
is way beyond what people understand that it is.

714
00:26:23.043 --> 00:26:26.023
It is the number one alchemical food in the world.

715
00:26:26.023 --> 00:26:29.183
The great story of the alchemist who sells his soul

716
00:26:29.183 --> 00:26:31.623
to the devil for fame and fortune now,

717
00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:34.701
only to pay the price later, that entire story

718
00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:36.639
was downloaded right out of the cacao bean

719
00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:39.019
by Goethe, the great German philosopher,

720
00:26:39.019 --> 00:26:41.757
who was a cacao and chocolate addict.

721
00:26:41.757 --> 00:26:43.875
That's the part they never tell you.

722
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:46.173
They never tell you that food could affect your

723
00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:48.713
architecture, your art, your inspiration,

724
00:26:48.713 --> 00:26:50.113
your level of awareness,

725
00:26:50.113 --> 00:26:51.231
that's the part they never tell you.

726
00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:51.847
<v Voiceover>Oh, and it does.</v>

727
00:26:51.847 --> 00:26:54.901
I've made some incredible things with the raw cocoa.

728
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:55.739
Oh, my god.

729
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.997
I mean, and it gives a clarity that's unbelievable.

730
00:26:57.997 --> 00:26:58.551
<v ->It's unbelievable.</v>

731
00:26:58.551 --> 00:26:59.955
<v Voiceover>If it's done correctly.</v>

732
00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:01.043
But again, let's talk about

733
00:27:01.043 --> 00:27:03.599
what it means to do it correctly versus Hershey's.

734
00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:04.534
<v ->Yeah.</v>

735
00:27:04.534 --> 00:27:05.850
Well, it's done with consciousness.

736
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.309
What Hershey's is doing, they're taking pesticide-infected

737
00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:13.459
cacao beans, which is really a nut, so it's a cacao nut.

738
00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:16.360
They, obviously, the whole slave labor issue

739
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.960
and everything that's going on in Africa about cacao

740
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.100
is just awful, and these giant companies have supported that

741
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.380
from the beginning all along,

742
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.816
and then they're cooking the heck out of it

743
00:27:26.816 --> 00:27:28.211
because it's contaminated with mold

744
00:27:28.211 --> 00:27:29.781
because they don't have a clean process,

745
00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:34.316
it's just all done very, very low-technology, low-tech,

746
00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:36.631
and then they cook the heck out of that stuff

747
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:38.331
then they winnow the skins off,

748
00:27:38.331 --> 00:27:42.351
and then they literally press the oils out of it.

749
00:27:42.351 --> 00:27:44.207
They take the cake, they separate it out,

750
00:27:44.207 --> 00:27:46.968
they refine it down, they cook it again,

751
00:27:46.968 --> 00:27:49.743
then they add alkali, like potassium carbonate

752
00:27:49.743 --> 00:27:54.522
or calcium carbonate, to the actual chocolate powder,

753
00:27:54.522 --> 00:27:58.437
and then they add that into whatever to make it chocolate.

754
00:27:58.437 --> 00:28:00.978
Meanwhile, the oils that have been stripped away,

755
00:28:00.978 --> 00:28:03.917
once through a high-pressure grinding method,

756
00:28:03.917 --> 00:28:06.074
and basically pressing the oil out,

757
00:28:06.074 --> 00:28:08.533
and the next through hexane extraction,

758
00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:11.683
they take that, which hexane is a carcinogen.

759
00:28:11.683 --> 00:28:14.014
They take that and they add it into all the cosmetics,

760
00:28:14.014 --> 00:28:16.014
they create suntan lotions out of it,

761
00:28:16.014 --> 00:28:19.050
and then sometimes, a little tiny bit of it will go back

762
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.379
into the chocolate bar.

763
00:28:20.379 --> 00:28:20.927
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

764
00:28:20.927 --> 00:28:22.261
<v ->The average little chocolate bar</v>

765
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:24.672
that you buy for two dollars in a store

766
00:28:24.672 --> 00:28:27.667
literally contains less than three cacao beans,

767
00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:30.327
and those have been massively damaged by heat,

768
00:28:30.327 --> 00:28:32.578
so they contain, actually, chocolate,

769
00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:35.174
the nut contains omega-6 fatty acids,

770
00:28:35.174 --> 00:28:37.644
and if you heat that, it turns into a trans-fatty acid,

771
00:28:37.644 --> 00:28:41.255
so all processed chocolate contains trans-fatty acids

772
00:28:41.255 --> 00:28:45.512
because it's indigenous to the cooking of the cacao bean.

773
00:28:45.512 --> 00:28:46.567
<v Voiceover>Thank you for bringing that up,</v>

774
00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:47.882
very important point.

775
00:28:47.882 --> 00:28:49.958
Let's look at, OK, now you've got these beautiful,

776
00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:52.193
a lot of natural kind of chocolate products here.

777
00:28:52.193 --> 00:28:54.967
What would a nice natural chocolate product look like?

778
00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:57.239
Well it would be made out of raw chocolate,

779
00:28:57.239 --> 00:28:59.138
it would be organic,

780
00:28:59.138 --> 00:29:00.435
it would be clean.

781
00:29:00.435 --> 00:29:03.669
That means that the source is microbe-free, so not dirty.

782
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:06.216
A lot of nuts and seeds, the stuff you buy in stores,

783
00:29:06.216 --> 00:29:08.870
they're dirty, I mean, you gotta wash them.

784
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.511
If you put them in a big thing of water

785
00:29:10.511 --> 00:29:12.046
and put a little hydrogen peroxide in,

786
00:29:12.046 --> 00:29:13.660
you'll see a lot of dirt, and then you'd be like,

787
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.435
"Whoa, that stuff's

788
00:29:14.435 --> 00:29:14.982
"not exactly..."
<v Voiceover>Well, now,</v>

789
00:29:14.982 --> 00:29:16.358
<v Voiceover>they're pasteurizing almonds.</v>

790
00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:18.149
<v ->Yeah, now they're, god knows what they're doing,</v>

791
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:19.244
not even pasteurizing it,

792
00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:20.720
they're moving towards irradiating--

793
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.290
<v Voiceover>I know, I know, it makes me so upset.</v>

794
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.124
Anyway, let's continue on that good chocolate story.

795
00:29:25.124 --> 00:29:26.896
<v ->Yeah, so good chocolate will have those components,</v>

796
00:29:26.896 --> 00:29:28.230
and then good chocolate will be mixed

797
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:32.446
with chocolate's best friends, like vanilla, right?

798
00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:34.800
Like agave, like honey, I mean,

799
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.536
you take a cacao bean, dip it in honey and eat that,

800
00:29:37.536 --> 00:29:41.003
that experience right there can change your life that fast.

801
00:29:41.003 --> 00:29:42.261
Change your whole food reality,

802
00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:44.319
everything that you think about food.

803
00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:45.877
That's the whole thing,

804
00:29:45.877 --> 00:29:48.496
is if you can get this alchemy right, you get, for example,

805
00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:51.655
cinnamon and cacao have a long history together.

806
00:29:51.655 --> 00:29:54.494
Some of the great alchemical mixtures from down South,

807
00:29:54.494 --> 00:29:56.771
South America, the herbal components.

808
00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:57.510
<v Voiceover>Spices.</v>

809
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.329
<v ->The spices like nutmeg and cloves</v>

810
00:30:00.329 --> 00:30:01.028
and that kind of stuff,

811
00:30:01.028 --> 00:30:03.127
this stuff has a natural affinity for cacao,

812
00:30:03.127 --> 00:30:05.284
'cause cacao takes the best herbs

813
00:30:05.284 --> 00:30:06.704
and the most powerful superfoods

814
00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:08.503
and the great spices of the world,

815
00:30:08.503 --> 00:30:12.164
and synergizes them together alchemically,

816
00:30:12.164 --> 00:30:15.243
and then you eat that and you get all that nutrition,

817
00:30:15.243 --> 00:30:17.802
it's all raw, it's all organic,

818
00:30:17.802 --> 00:30:20.401
and you're also, interestingly enough,

819
00:30:20.401 --> 00:30:22.841
having the best day ever, too

820
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:25.276
because chocolate makes all those chemicals

821
00:30:25.276 --> 00:30:27.556
that make you feel good.

822
00:30:27.556 --> 00:30:28.512
<v Voiceover>Yeah, they do.</v>

823
00:30:28.512 --> 00:30:30.150
<v ->You know, like, they can feel like,</v>

824
00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.629
"Whoa, I want to keep living on this planet."

825
00:30:32.629 --> 00:30:33.868
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and you don't feel depleted</v>

826
00:30:33.868 --> 00:30:34.587
at the end of it.

827
00:30:34.587 --> 00:30:35.905
It's not like it's a big spike

828
00:30:35.905 --> 00:30:37.361
and then you suddenly drop off

829
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:39.698
and are just searching for coffee, for example.

830
00:30:39.698 --> 00:30:41.018
It's really a clean high.

831
00:30:41.018 --> 00:30:43.436
<v ->Yeah, I believe that's the whole point of living foods.</v>

832
00:30:43.436 --> 00:30:44.515
It's like how do we get the high

833
00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:46.572
without the hangover, always.

834
00:30:46.572 --> 00:30:48.911
How are we always high without any hangover

835
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:50.488
on the back end or side effects.

836
00:30:50.488 --> 00:30:50.867
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

837
00:30:50.867 --> 00:30:53.384
<v ->And we are so trained or conditioned</v>

838
00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:55.043
that if you get high, then you have to go low,

839
00:30:55.043 --> 00:30:57.480
it's like that's a conditioning, right?

840
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.323
You get high, you get the alcohol high,

841
00:30:59.323 --> 00:31:01.332
next thing you know, you have the hangover.

842
00:31:01.332 --> 00:31:05.548
That, to even get people out of that program is interesting

843
00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:07.082
because people think, oh you get high,

844
00:31:07.082 --> 00:31:09.321
then you're gonna have a crash or something like this.

845
00:31:09.321 --> 00:31:12.359
It's like, no, you keep going higher and higher,

846
00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:15.338
and your highs get higher and your lows get higher,

847
00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:17.275
so the lows keep going higher,

848
00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.554
and your highs keep going higher,

849
00:31:18.554 --> 00:31:21.503
and next thing you know, it is the best ever.

850
00:31:21.503 --> 00:31:22.887
You're living the best reality ever,

851
00:31:22.887 --> 00:31:24.446
and then you discover,

852
00:31:24.446 --> 00:31:26.665
this is such a powerful point about living food,

853
00:31:26.665 --> 00:31:30.684
you discover that the truth of the esoteric teachings

854
00:31:30.684 --> 00:31:32.363
that heaven lies within.

855
00:31:32.363 --> 00:31:33.922
I never could even touch that.

856
00:31:33.922 --> 00:31:36.322
It was all a distant idea.

857
00:31:36.322 --> 00:31:37.880
Lots of yogis have come to me

858
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.854
who've gotten into living food and told me that.

859
00:31:39.854 --> 00:31:42.252
That the heaven lies within concept is a distant idea

860
00:31:42.252 --> 00:31:44.090
until living foods comes in the picture.

861
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.669
Then suddenly, inside yourself, you feel,

862
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:48.228
"Whoa, I feel good."

863
00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:49.287
<v Voiceover>Yeah, you feel like your cells</v>

864
00:31:49.287 --> 00:31:50.201
are full of light.

865
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:51.859
<v ->Yeah, full of light, yeah!</v>

866
00:31:51.859 --> 00:31:53.839
Frequencies of light, all the minerals,

867
00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:57.797
which are frequencies of light, illuminating your soul.

868
00:31:57.797 --> 00:31:59.475
That is the power of living foods.

869
00:31:59.475 --> 00:32:02.674
You come fully, your soul comes fully alive into your body,

870
00:32:02.674 --> 00:32:05.431
and I mean, it's hard,

871
00:32:05.431 --> 00:32:08.030
it's challenging to tell people the truth about living food

872
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.448
because they can't believe it.

873
00:32:09.448 --> 00:32:11.607
They can't understand it, I mean, I couldn't understand it.

874
00:32:11.607 --> 00:32:13.346
I have no reference point.

875
00:32:13.346 --> 00:32:15.945
I grew up on Flintstones Chewable Vitamins and Froot Loops!

876
00:32:15.945 --> 00:32:16.664
(Voiceover laughs)

877
00:32:16.664 --> 00:32:18.643
And pasteurized, homogenized, larvicide,

878
00:32:18.643 --> 00:32:21.219
pesticide, herbicide, antibioticized,

879
00:32:21.219 --> 00:32:23.699
chemicalized, hormonally altered,

880
00:32:23.699 --> 00:32:27.058
pus-filled, chock-filled, blood-filled milk!

881
00:32:27.058 --> 00:32:28.916
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs)</v>

882
00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:30.654
<v ->I mean, how could I have any concept</v>

883
00:32:30.654 --> 00:32:33.789
of what food could really be with that?

884
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:36.169
I didn't, there's no way I could,

885
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:38.248
but the experiences have taught me

886
00:32:38.248 --> 00:32:40.186
that the power of living foods

887
00:32:40.186 --> 00:32:43.935
to rejuvenate every cell is ever-present.

888
00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:46.563
Living foods is always around us all the time

889
00:32:46.563 --> 00:32:48.962
and at any time, we can just go, decision,

890
00:32:48.962 --> 00:32:52.390
now I'm on to this, and just bringing light in.

891
00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:54.715
It's powerful.
<v Voiceover>Well,</v>

892
00:32:54.715 --> 00:32:56.474
<v Voiceover>if people watching this are not juiced up,</v>

893
00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:58.393
no pun intended by this,

894
00:32:58.393 --> 00:32:59.991
I don't know what it's going to take.

895
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:01.050
You're just wonderful.

896
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.729

897

899
00:33:07.004 --> 00:33:08.550
