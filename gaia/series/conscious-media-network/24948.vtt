00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>In part one of our
interviews with Ralph Ellis,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.140 align:middle line:84%
he shared his research
into the roots

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.220 align:middle line:84%
of some of the most
illustrious characters

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.630 align:middle line:90%
from the Old Testament.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.940 align:middle line:84%
In this interview
Ralph discusses

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.730 align:middle line:84%
what he believes to be the
roots, or family tree as it

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.130 align:middle line:90%
were, of Jesus.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:84%
In brief, Ralph's research,
based on the books of Josephus,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
who diaried events he witnessed,
along with information

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
contained in the
original Torah, suggest

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.153 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was not only
high born, but mighty.

00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Where we last left
off, we were talking

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
about the similarities
between Egyptian history

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and the Old Testament and
the plight of the Israelites,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
how a lot of the names,
the buildings, the family

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
structures, et cetera,
actually overlay each other

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:90%
in a more than convenient way.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to
continue along that line.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
You've written a book called,
Jesus, Last of the Pharaohs.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And this would be quite
shocking to a lot of people.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.485 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and
dive right into it

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
assume they've already

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:90%
watched the previous interview.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So getting into the
bloodline of Jesus,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:84%
let's start right there
with Jesus' ancestry

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:84%
according to what you've been
able to glean from the texts.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And this also takes up
on the next book as well.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just Jesus,
Last of the Pharaohs.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's also Cleopatra
to Christ as well.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Last of the
Pharaohs was my first book.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote this, and
I said quite clearly

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:84%
at the end of this
book that Jesus

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
had to be from
the Egyptian royal

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
line, hence the name of the
book, Last of the Pharaohs.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know where
you could hang him

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:90%
on the Egyptian royal line.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know from
what era he sprang

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
or from which part
of the royal line.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And so this sort of
waited for several years

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
until I could get my research
into this going again.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And so I had this problem.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And the basic problem was I
knew that Jesus was royal.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.259 align:middle line:84%
There are many
parts of the Bible

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that sort of hint
at him being royal.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.975 align:middle line:84%
>>And this is popping up in
a lot of different literature

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's all over.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>He wasn't a lowly carpenter.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Indeed, no.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
The carpenter business
came from Setepenra,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
which was one of the titles
of the pharaohs of Egypt.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.935 align:middle line:84%
Setepenra means the
gods' carpenter.

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:90%
He was King of the Jews.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:90%
So we knew he was royal.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Christ, he was the Christ.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Christ means King.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:90%
That's all it means.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It means King.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:90%
So we knew he was royal.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was something to do
from the Egyptian royal line

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
because if you do a
comparison between the Bible

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and Josephus, his works,
it's clear that he was also

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
called the Egyptian
false prophet.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have
this link to Egypt.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And we know that Jesus went
to Egypt for his education.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:90%
So we have this link.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:90%
He was royal.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.164 align:middle line:84%
And he was also something
to do with Egypt.

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Although in the
Bible, it would really

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
be interpreted more as a status
of his morality and position,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.485 align:middle line:84%
as God's Son, as
the King of Man.

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>That's rather convenient.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>So you're saying it's
actually quite literal.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>He was literally a royal.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But we have another
problem here.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
at his birth it is

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:84%
said that he was
visited by the Magi.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.855 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Magi were the
priesthood of Persia,

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:56.887 align:middle line:90%
or Parthia.

00:03:56.887 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
only the priesthood.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
They were also the
king-makers of Parthia.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, when Jesus was born--

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking him to be
born in A.D. 4 or A.D. 6,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
taxation event.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time, the throne of
Parthia, or Persia, was empty.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So what were the
Parthian-Persian king makers

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
doing at Jesus' birth, looking
at Jesus as a potential mark.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:90%
So we have a problem here.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
What I was looking
for was a monarch,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.892 align:middle line:84%
a prince, who was of
the Egyptian royal line,

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Persian royal line,
but somehow exiled in Judea

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
in circumstances
of semi-poverty.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:90%
So is it possible?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Could we find a
royal family that

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
was exiled into
Judea at this time?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, funnily enough, there was.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The king and queen of Persia
were exiled to Syrio-Judea,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
just to the East of the
River Jordan, in A.D. 4.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a royal family
out of Persia, exiled to Judea,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
living in a state of
poverty in Syrio-Judea.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.255 align:middle line:90%
So this was rather interesting.

00:05:27.255 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:90%
This is real history.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:90%
People know about this.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it's
very easy for historians

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to sideline sections of
history because it's not

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the sort of part of history
you will actually come across

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:84%
if you go through
history at school

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
or even if you do
history at university.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not a part of history
you're likely to know about.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a forgotten history.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
further into the history

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:90%
of this particular royal family.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And it seems likely to me--

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:90%
The reasons are complex.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to go into
all of the circumstances.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me, this lady,
the queen that was exiled,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
was the daughter
of Cleopatra VII.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
the lost daughter
of Cleopatra VII.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know Cleopatra
had several children.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And this lady was given to
the Persian King Phraates IV

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:90%
as a diplomatic gift.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.305 align:middle line:84%
Now, it says in the text
that she was a prostitute.

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But that is not
the sort of person

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:90%
you give as a diplomatic gift.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
This was Augustus,
Caesar of Rome.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
He was having a great deal
of problems with Persia.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.072 align:middle line:84%
Persia was the biggest
kingdom on his eastern border.

00:06:51.072 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:90%
He had had a lot of problems.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
They had lost two major
battles against the Persians.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.165 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to give a
spectacular gift to Phraates

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%
to end the hostilities.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And he gives Phraates
a prostitute?

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So who was this
lady that he gave?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And for many
reasons, she just has

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to be the lost daughter
of Cleopatra VII.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So now we have all
of the elements

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
that I was looking for.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
This queen was not only queen of
Persia, married to Phraates IV,

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.809 align:middle line:84%
but she was also of the
Egyptian royal line.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:41.225 align:middle line:84%
She was the daughter
of Cleopatra.

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And they reigned for
a number of years.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:90%
So she became chief.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
She didn't just become
the wife of this King.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:90%
She became chief wife.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And her son became
the prince of Persia.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So again, very strange,
you know, this prostitute,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
she suddenly becomes
chief wife of Persia.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But then they had a problem,
which we'll come to maybe a bit

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And she fell foul of the regime.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were kicked
out of Persia.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And so off they went with 200
courtiers and 600 cavalry,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:90%
archers, so mounted archers.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So she had her own
bodyguards, 600 archers.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And they were exiled into Judea.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So as I said before, we
come back to the fact

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that we were looking
for a royal prince born

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in some degree of
poverty in Syrio-Judea.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
this royal family

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the
same circumstances.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this lady, this queen
was called Thea Musa Armenia

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Urania.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the area that
she settled in, just

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to the East of the River
Jordan, just to the East of Oman

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:90%
became the kingdom of Urania.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
She set up a city-state,
a new city-state,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:90%
called Urania, after her name.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.274 align:middle line:84%
So it was known as
the kingdom of Urania.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's still called
that now actually.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Huron, which
comes from the same name.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
But if we translate that
into English, of course,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
the kingdom of Urania becomes
the kingdom of heaven.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was its name.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this prince
born to this queen, who

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:90%
came from the kingdom of heaven.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I start linking
the early part of the New

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.005 align:middle line:90%
Testament into real history.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I believe
Jesus was descended from.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So he was a prince, a very
well connected prince.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And we can now
see perhaps why he

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:90%
was so important in this era.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.872 align:middle line:84%
We're not just looking
for a nobody carpenter.

00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>A rebel rouser.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Why would a--

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.215 align:middle line:84%
I suppose a few people who
come from lowly backgrounds

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
do too rise up through the
system, I suppose, but--

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.572 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Here we're looking
for a prince who

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
made his mark in this
era in this area,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:90%
in fact, in the wider region.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
sort of prince that

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
could've done exactly that.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
He would have been descended
from the royal line of Egypt,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:84%
from Julius Caesar, from
the royal line of Persia,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and also from the royal line
of North Africa, Mauritania.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So here was a prince
that could've--

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>And this you have this lineage
in your book for people to be

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
able to--

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a complex lineage.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.497 align:middle line:84%
So it's difficult
to go through it.

00:10:57.497 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>And you would have to
say the evidence is there.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond circumstantial
evidence in your mind.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Or would you still say
it is circumstantial?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Some is circumstantial
because there

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:90%
are elements that are missing.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we can only look at the
links that link them together

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
definitive text that says,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
yes, this woman was the
daughter of Cleopatra.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
However, we do know that
Cleopatra was pregnant

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:90%
when she fled from Rome.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
What we don't have
is a text that

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
says where this child went.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this strange woman

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:90%
who pops up 20 years later.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, some of the
links are circumstantial.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at this
lady, what she looks like,

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
who she was, what her name was,
all of those link straight back

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
into the line of
Cleopatra and to Egypt,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
especially her
contentious marriage,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.299 align:middle line:90%
which even Jesus talks about.

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the links.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Can you talk about this a bit?

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We're probably jumping ahead
of ourselves a little bit here.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But one of the reasons
why I am convinced

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that this has to
do with Jesus is

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
because he talks of this
contentious marriage.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one of his parables
that he talks about.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And this was such a
strange, unusual event

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that it would seem inconceivable
that he would mention

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
this strange marriage
if it was not

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:90%
something to do with his family.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And here we come to the
reason why he could not

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
be included in the biblical
text because, OK, we

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
have this prince,
very influential, very

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:90%
well connected.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:90%
So why don't they admit that?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.969 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they say, this
is our hero, big prince?

00:12:54.969 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's two main reasons.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, it wasn't his
church, as we said before,

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:90%
in our previous interview.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Christianity was
the church of Saul,

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with
the church of Jesus.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Saul wanted this tale
about a lowly carpenter,

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, which didn't really
fit in with the story of Jesus

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%
being a prince.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps more
importantly, he also

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be head of the Church.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And after him,
obviously, Saint Peter.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
How could he be the
head of the Church,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and all the popes later on
be the head of the Church

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
if we had a royal bloodline
the was still living?

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And surely they
would, of course,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
have been the head
of the Church.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So the popes, of course,
of the Catholic Church

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:90%
are effectively priest kings.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:90%
They are kings of the Church.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But how can they be a
priest king of the church

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
if we have a real bloodline
prince still living

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:90%
in that era?

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>So he had to, essentially,
be knocked off of his throne

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to a lower status.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>All Saul wanted was an icon.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So he had this picture
he could hold up.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:90%
He had this icon.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The last thing he wanted
was this real prince

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
with real sons
and real daughters

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
still living somewhere
in the Far East.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't be
head of the Church

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:90%
if this person was still there.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:90%
And so they had to be sidelined.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
They had to be taken
out of the picture.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the reasons
why this prince was taken out

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:90%
effectively.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
The other reason is
that the circumstances

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
of this royal family's
life did not fit in, again,

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
with the story he
was trying to preach.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Saul's story is about
an ideal family,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the Waltons of the first
century A.D. Unfortunately,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
the reign of Thea Musa Urania
was not quite so idyllic.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Thea Musa herself
killed her husband.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And she then married her son.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.662 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.662 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
is one of the reasons

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I say that she was of
the Egyptian royal line

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
because this was normal
practice, of course,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:90%
for the Egyptian royal line.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people hear
this, we immediately,

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
ugh, start freaking out
by today's standards.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, that was
common in bloodlines.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, and those standards
that you're saying we have this

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:90%
reaction to--

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Incest.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.064 align:middle line:90%
>>Incest, yes.

00:15:44.064 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
--was created by Saul, of
course, in a later era.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So going back into
Egypt especially

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
during the Ptolemaic royal
line, the most important thing

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
for the royal family--

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
incest wouldn't have

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
been a normal thing for
all Egyptians, of course.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the royal family here.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And within the royal family,
the most important thing

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:84%
was the maintenance
of the bloodline.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And how to do that?

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, you keep it
within the family.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go
back into Egypt, we

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
find that sibling marriage was
very common, almost mandatory.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
If we look at Akhenaten,
for instance, Akhenaten

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
married two of his
daughters, maybe three.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
Nefertiti was his sister.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I thought she was
his half sister.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, she could have
been a half sister.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Hard to say.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>It's very confused in that
era, so we're not quite sure.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But certainly she would
have been a close relative.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
If you come down into
the Ptolemaic era--

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the era of the Greek
pharaohs of Egypt, of course.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
--all of the Greek
pharaohs of Egypt

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
married a sibling
of some nature.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Cleopatra herself married
two of her brothers.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this was perfectly
normal for the royal family,

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
mandatory even, to maintain
the bloodline in its purity.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I say
that Thea Musa Urania was

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptian royal line
because she was keeping

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
the same consanguinity rules as
they did in Egypt, which places

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
her strongly within the
Egyptian royal line.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know this
wasn't a Persian custom

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
because that is the reason they
kicked her out of the country.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So quite clearly incest
was not a Persian custom.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It was Egyptian.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say
she was Egyptian.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the reason
she was kicked out of Egypt.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has a big bearing
on Saul's perspective.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>I was just going
to say in casting

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians as the
root of all evil.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And the demonization,
of course, of incest.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
How do you eradicate
a royal line?

00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:00.454 align:middle line:84%
Well, you stop them doing
their usual customs.

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the usual
customs, of course,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptian royal
line was incest.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you make
incest taboo, you've

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:90%
just ruined the royal family.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you look at this as
in pedigrees of other species,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
this is always what's
done to keep the pedigree.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, indeed.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a royal pedigree.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's still actually.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's my strong belief that
it is still carried out today.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:84%
However, of course, to
maintain the normal rules we

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
have in our society, of
course, all the marriages

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
occur within close
relatives, cousins.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But you can still maintain
the bloodline, but just

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:84%
by having two separate lines
and marrying between cousins.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure it's still carried
out to some respects today.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>So how does this now going
back to the birth of Jesus?

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, so we have our prince.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the reasons
for the New Testament story,

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
why this prince was important,
why he became a leader.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back into the
works of Josephus again,

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:84%
he says that at this very
time a fourth sect of Judaism

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:90%
was set up.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.062 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't think that
Jesus was of the Essene sect.

00:19:29.062 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I was just going to
ask you about that.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
There were three main sects,
the Sadducees, the Pharisees,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and the Essene.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But there was also
a fourth sect.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think Jesus was
of this fourth sect.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Because this fourth sect was
very, very closely related

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to this area I'm talking
about, to the East of the River

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Jordan, which was called
Bethania, Bethany.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably where we
get the biblical Bethany from.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And this particular fourth
sect maintained its own army,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
just as Thea Musa
Urania had her own army,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and just as Jesus had
his own army as well.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come onto
that in a little bit.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think he was of this
fourth sect of Judaism.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably
from this fourth sect

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes were a
later branch off from them.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And the main concern
of the fourth sect

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.132 align:middle line:84%
was taxation because Thea
Musa Urania, when she set up

00:20:38.132 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:84%
her city-state, was
given the lands tax-free.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
was done, of course,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
was because she, with
her independent army,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.035 align:middle line:84%
could act as a mercenary army
for Herod, Herod Archelaus.

00:20:56.035 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, just to set
the record straight,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
Mary, the one who

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.125 align:middle line:84%
would be known as
Mary in the Bible?

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it might have
been Jesus' grandmother.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I think there was probably
another generation.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think Mary herself was
Thea Musa Urania's daughter.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're jumping
one more generation.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And the daughter
of Thea Musa Urania

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:90%
was known as Julia Urania.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:90%
She virtually had the same name.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:35.079 align:middle line:84%
And that is the generation,
I think, of Jesus.

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So she would have
been Jesus' mother.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Sorry.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to sidetrack you.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.089 align:middle line:90%
>>No, that's fine.

00:21:42.089 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated history.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, very complicated.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
keep the thread going.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So you were talking
about taxation.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we know that Jesus had
a lot of problems with taxation.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We know the turning
over the tables,

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, in the temple.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But also one of the main
accusations against him

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
was that he consorted with
publicans and sinners.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, publicans has been
very badly translated

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
because the word actually
means tax collector.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the main
accusations against him

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
was that he was consorting
with tax collectors.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So we know that one
of the main problems

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was having
was over taxation.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And these people to the
East of the River Jordan

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:90%
had this tax-free status.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And that tax-free status
was causing some friction,

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.274 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted to end it.

00:22:34.274 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they didn't want it

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:84%
ended because that's
how they maintained

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
their own private army.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And as I said before, Jesus
also had his own army.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might sound
a little bit peculiar.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But in order to find out these
historical details about Jesus,

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
we need to be able to find
further texts because the Bible

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:90%
doesn't give the full story.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly enough, there
are other texts about Jesus.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
are totally ignored.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Where do we find these texts?

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Within the books of Josephus.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to
clarify this, we

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:90%
need to know who Josephus was.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Josephus was the army commander
in command of Galilee.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And he later became the
primary historian of this era.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote his
own old testament

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and his own new
testament effectively.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have the complete
history of Judea from Josephus.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.290 align:middle line:90%
But who was he?

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Or rather perhaps I
should turn this around.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Who was Saul?

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Here we have Saul, we
were talking about before,

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
who was the founder
of Christianity.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
He was the most important person
perhaps in the last 2000 years.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And they've lost him.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:84%
How do you lose all
these important people

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:90%
from the historical record?

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe that was true.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It can't be true that
we lose so many people.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So I started to look for Saul
within the historical record.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly found there were
about 24 points commonality

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
between the life of Saul
and the life of Josephus.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I came to the
conclusion in the end

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that Saul was Josephus because
they had the same goals.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:90%
They had everything in common.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They both wrote
histories of that era.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.077 align:middle line:84%
But this is
interesting because--

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, wouldn't that
make it slightly skewed

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
if you say there was a
specific agenda with Saul.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, there was.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.311 align:middle line:84%
He very much had his
own agenda, of course.

00:24:48.311 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:90%
And so did--

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.079 align:middle line:84%
>>So you're saying Josephus'
agenda lines up with--

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>--Saul's?

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Completely.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They were both traitors to
the system, effectively.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:90%
They both changed sides twice.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So Saul tried to join
the Church of Jesus,

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and then was kicked
out or whatever

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.625 align:middle line:90%
and went off on his own.

00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, he had his flash
of inspiration on the road

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.642 align:middle line:84%
to Damascus because
Saul was persecuting

00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:84%
the Church of Jesus
and James, of course.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mention
how within the Bible.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
How was he persecuting them
and sending them to prison?

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Under what jurisdiction
did he send them to prison?

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not mentioned.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But Saul tried to join the
Church of Jesus and James

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and then split off
and went his own way.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at Josephus,
and he did exactly the same.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Josephus was the army commander
in command of Galilee.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And his main opponent that
he was chasing around Galilee

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:90%
was Jesus.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>I see.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, conventional
historians will say, oh,

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:90%
it's a different Jesus.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
No, this was the same
Jesus because this Jesus

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
was Jesus of Gamala,
who owned his own army.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he was the rebel
leader of 600 fishermen.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So who in this era was the
rebel leader of 600 fishermen?

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We can only be talking
about the biblical Jesus.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And so Josephus does
exactly the same as Saul.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
He was the chief of
police in that era.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.340 align:middle line:84%
He was persecuting
this particular Jesus

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And his band of rebel fishermen.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:84%
He then sort of
tried to join them.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, after
some disputes with the Romans

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and after the siege
of [? Japala, ?]

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:90%
he went off on his own.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And he changed sides
again, just as Saul did.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So again, he
changed sides twice.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
amongst many reasons

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:90%
why I think they are the same.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:07.770 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing is it
then gives us a new insight

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
into the life of Jesus
because the whole of Josephus'

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
discussion about this
era was his battles

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
with this person called Jesus.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us a
completely new set

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:84%
of texts that detail the
life of the biblical Jesus.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that
this particular Jesus

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:90%
was quite important.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:90%
He was the governor of Tiberius.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:90%
And he owned a castle.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And he also was the
leader of 600 soldiers.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, here we start linking
back into the fourth sect

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and to Thea Musa
Urania, who also

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:84%
had their own
independent army, exactly

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:90%
the same as this Jesus did.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems likely that
Jesus had his own armed forces.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might say, well,
that's completely impossible.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
That's just not present
within the Bible.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Bible as well.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
look for the texts.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And we come back to
sort of Matthew 10:34,

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus says, I don't
come to bring peace.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I come not to bring
peace to the world.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:90%
I come to bring a sword.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the event
on the Mount of Olives, which

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:84%
is a curious affair
because we have

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and his disciples on
the Mount of Olives at night,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're surprised
by the Roman guard.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, just before this
happens, of course, Luke 22:36,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.850 align:middle line:84%
he tells his disciples
to go out and buy swords.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Sell your purse and your
wallet, and go and buy swords.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The disciples come
back with swords.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And he says, it's enough.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
different sort of Jesus

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:90%
to what we're expecting.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not a Jesus that is
preached from the pulpit.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't get these
verses from the pulpit.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a revolutionary Jesus.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.305 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's what
Jesus the Galilean means.

00:29:22.305 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:90%
We say Jesus of Galilee.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does Galilee mean?

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.955 align:middle line:84%
It means a circle,
a revolutionary.

00:29:26.955 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this event
on the Mount of Olives

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
at night, where they're
surprised by the Roman guard.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're surprised
by not just one

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:90%
or two Romans that come up.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.776 align:middle line:84%
They're surprised
by a [? spirah ?],

00:29:44.776 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
a cohort, 600 fully
armed centurions.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So can we have a different
angle on this particular event?

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is the advantage with
having Josephus and his texts.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, we do
because Josephus

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:90%
writes exactly the same account.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is that Josephus

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:18.590 align:middle line:84%
says there were 30,000 armed
people on the Mount of Olives.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And the intent was to
take Jerusalem by force.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
the leader of this

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:84%
was the Egyptian false
prophet, Jesus himself.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it's clear from
these different texts

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about a rebel
leader, a man of influence,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:84%
a man with a great
number of followers,

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
who was interested in the
secular politics of that era.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Although within
Judaism, of course,

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.160 align:middle line:84%
you cannot separate
politics and religion.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:90%
It's identical.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But here we have
a rebel leader who

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.355 align:middle line:84%
is going to take
Jerusalem by force.

00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But they were foiled, of
course, because the Roman guard,

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in both versions, the
Roman guard comes out,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:90%
and they are scattered.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end of the
bid to take Jerusalem.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have a
completely different perspective

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
on the events of
the New Testament.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>So we go now into his life.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And as many books are
coming out about Jesus' life

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.752 align:middle line:84%
as a husband and a father,
and dare we go into this area?

00:31:38.752 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, of course.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>So why don't we go from there?

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, I suppose the main
thing that's come up recently

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:90%
is the Da Vinci Code.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And was Jesus married?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Da Vinci Code
has actually just put this

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:90%
into the public perspective.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's been around
obviously for years,

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
this question as to whether
he married Mary Magdalene.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And it seems quite
clear to me that he did.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:84%
They made a big fuss
about Leonardo Da Vinci

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and his last supper
scene, of course,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.842 align:middle line:84%
and said that this is a
woman on the right hand side.

00:32:14.842 --> 00:32:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And lots of people will
stand up and say, no, no, no.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Especially people from
the religious authorities

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:90%
say it's not possible.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Strangely enough, that is
not an unusual depiction.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.240 align:middle line:84%
There are many
last supper scenes,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:84%
of course, that have been
painted around the world.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you go around the
stately homes of Britain,

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.007 align:middle line:84%
you'll find quite a few last
supper scenes with a woman

00:32:44.007 --> 00:32:45.340 align:middle line:90%
on the right hand side of Jesus.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And quite clearly,
they are woman.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
But I was surprised
because I was

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:84%
doing some research
on a different topic

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:90%
entirely in Ireland.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went out to a cathedral
just north of Dublin.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was a last
supper scene there as well.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:90%
This was a marble one.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It's quite well done
actually in white marble.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And quite clearly, the disciple
on the right hand side of Jesus

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:90%
was a woman.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.005 align:middle line:84%
But this is a Catholic
cathedral in the middle

00:33:19.005 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:90%
of Catholic Ireland.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And still, the disciple on
the right hand side of Jesus

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:90%
was a woman.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And I did a little piece
for the local newspaper

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:90%
and said it's a woman.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the custodians
of the church, of the cathedral

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:90%
said, oh no, it's clearly not.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.840 align:middle line:90%
But everyone that--

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you can show
a little depiction of it

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.890 align:middle line:90%
as a part of this talk.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Quite clearly, everyone
I've spoken to have said,

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's a woman.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:90%
It can't be anything else.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
these secrets that

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
have been withheld
from the laity,

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.660 align:middle line:84%
clearly held even within
the Catholic church.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:84%
They know that Mary Magdalene
was an important part,

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.974 align:middle line:84%
the most important disciple
within the disciples.

00:34:09.974 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I go into a great deal
of detail about who she was,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.449 align:middle line:84%
what she was, and how her
history links back all the way

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:26.669 align:middle line:84%
back to the [INAUDIBLE] of
the united monarchy, that

00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:84%
were these important
women who played out

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
important roles
within their theology.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.989 align:middle line:84%
They were known
as the god's wife.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And you will find a
lot of the reasoning

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
behind what Mary
Magdalene was doing

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:90%
in the title of god's wife.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It comes back from Egypt
again because within Egypt--

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Without going too
much into detail,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:90%
--god needed a consort.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the original god, Atum,
did not have a consort.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.080 align:middle line:90%
There was no goddess equivalent.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And so he needed a consort.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the position of
god's wife was invented.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So we had this mortal
wife of the god.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And this tradition
has gone all the way

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:24.460 align:middle line:84%
through the Egyptian eras,
all the way through the united

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.640 align:middle line:84%
monarchy and into
the first century.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And I have no doubt
that Mary Magdalene

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:90%
was the god's wife in that era.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And the names match up,
and many things match up.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And so she was Mary
Magdalene, Mary of the tower.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene means tower.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And the original
tower referred to

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
was probably something
to do with the pyramids.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:90%
So she was Mary of the tower.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.617 align:middle line:90%
She was the equivalent of Isis.

00:35:55.617 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if we look
at the Madonna and child

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:84%
imagery, of course, from the New
Testament, it's pure Egyptian.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:90%
It comes from Isis, of course.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And so she was a
manifestation of Isis.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But we see sort of
little manifestations

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Magdalene
down the ages as well

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:84%
because she was
lost from history.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You weren't able to mention her
as being such an important part

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.790 align:middle line:90%
of the New Testament story.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we had all these
extra stories were made up,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:84%
fairy stories,
things like Rapunzel.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Rapunzel in the tower
with her golden hair.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Mary
Magdalene in the Talmud

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:84%
is known as the
dresser of lady's hair.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Magdalene
itself means the tower.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the lady in the
tower with the hair.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just got to be a
reference to Mary Magdalene.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we get a lot of these
lost princess stories running

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:90%
down through later.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Why was it so important to
demote her to a lowly woman

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and see to it that
Jesus remained celibate?

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>It has to be the destruction
of the royal family.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.667 align:middle line:84%
As I said previously,
Saul set up Christianity.

00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to do with the
Church of Jesus and James.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
He could not be the
leader of that church

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:33.420 align:middle line:84%
if there was a royal family
running alongside him,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:84%
who was still existent,
still had sons and daughters.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>So she, in essence,
had to be demoted,

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and he had to be written
out of the script.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>The whole of that royal
family had to be destroyed.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the popes
could not be the popes.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And so they had to be destroyed.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>So we go to the crucifixion.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:90%
So the crucifixion--

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.840 align:middle line:90%
So was Jesus crucified?

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, possibly.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think he
was crucified in A.D. 30

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:84%
because all of these events
that we've been talking about,

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the links with Josephus, the
being persecuted within Galilee

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and so on, all of that
happened in about A.D. 60, 65.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>And when would Mary have
come into the picture, had

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.860 align:middle line:84%
he married her and
had children with her?

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, they could have married
and had children at any time.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're probably
talking something

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.700 align:middle line:84%
around A.D. 20,
25, 30 or something

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:90%
for their particular marriage.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:84%
They could have had old
children by this time.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So all of these events
we've been talking about

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:90%
didn't occur back in A.D. 30.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:84%
All of these events
happened in about A.D. 65.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus would have been
much older at this point.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.320 align:middle line:84%
He would have been
around 60 years old.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.794 align:middle line:84%
And Josephus would have been
much younger, around 30.

00:38:54.794 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So the crucifixion,
if it happened,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:90%
did not happen in A.D. 30.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But of course, as
we go down the years

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and come through A.D.
65, A.D. 70, of course,

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
then we enter the most
traumatic era in Judaic history.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was the destruction
of the temple of Jerusalem.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
civil war going on.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.144 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of the reason
for the story about the Mount

00:39:25.144 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of Olives and why
there would have

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
been 30,000 soldiers on
the Mount of Olives going

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.252 align:middle line:84%
to take Jerusalem
by storm, et cetera.

00:39:33.252 --> 00:39:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Why was that happening?

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.784 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a
civil war going on.

00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying,
of course, is

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was one of those
elements within that civil war.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is a real civil
war from history, of course.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But this civil war,
of course, started

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.027 align:middle line:84%
to involve the Romans
because effectively this

00:39:53.027 --> 00:39:54.485 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be
Roman territory.

00:39:54.485 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
the Romans wanted

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.470 align:middle line:84%
was this major dispute going
on their eastern borders

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:84%
because they were afraid
of Persia, of course.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And so Vespasian,
the army commander,

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:12.066 align:middle line:84%
was sent to restore order
in the area, of course.

00:40:12.066 --> 00:40:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And so he went
all around Galilee

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.898 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed all
the cities there,

00:40:14.898 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and regained
control of Galilee.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, they
marched on Jerusalem itself.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And so then we have this major
event, the siege of Jerusalem.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at the end
of the siege of Jerusalem,

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:90%
the Jews lose, of course.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem is destroyed.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.120 align:middle line:84%
The people are either
killed during this assault

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.249 align:middle line:90%
or they're taken off as slaves.

00:40:45.249 --> 00:40:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Or scattered about
in one way or another.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Or scattered, yes,
on a huge exodus again.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So all of the Jewish population
thrown out of Israel.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And hence, all this problem
we have today, of course,

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.820 align:middle line:84%
with the Zionists wanting
to go back into Israel.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.380 align:middle line:84%
All of this occurred because
the Roman army dispersed

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.410 align:middle line:90%
all of the Jews out of Israel.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But at the last
moment, of course--

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And Josephus, this person
we've been talking about,

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Saul Josephus, was a major
component within this war.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:84%
He was now working
for the Romans.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.060 align:middle line:84%
He had given up on the
Jews and working for Jesus.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was now
working for Vespasian

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.570 align:middle line:90%
as propaganda minister.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Lord Haw Haw, if anyone knows
their World War II history.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We had the same sort of
event during World War II.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.204 align:middle line:84%
So effectively,
he was a traitor.

00:41:44.204 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Jews
were concerned,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.680 align:middle line:84%
he was working for
the wrong side.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But, of course,
when Jerusalem fell,

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:84%
he was in a perfect
position to write

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.140 align:middle line:84%
a history of these events
and this era, which he did.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, he was
given some special thank

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.440 align:middle line:84%
you presents by
Vespasian and Titus,

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.520 align:middle line:90%
the army commanders of Rome.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.470 align:middle line:90%
He was given lands in Judea.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.650 align:middle line:90%
He was given a wife.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:84%
He was given all of the scrolls
from the temple of Jerusalem.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I depend so much
on his texts, not only his New

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Testament texts, but
his Old Testament texts

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.280 align:middle line:84%
as well, because he
had the original Torah

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.080 align:middle line:90%
from the temple of Jerusalem.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So his Torah, his Old
Testament, is far more ancient

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and far more authoritative
than any Torah

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:90%
we have existent today.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I tend to
rely on his texts very much.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But he was given one
other special present.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:84%
He asked a favor of
Titus because when

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.080 align:middle line:84%
he entered Jerusalem,
there were three

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.650 align:middle line:90%
of his previous acquaintances--

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember now he's
on the wrong side.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:90%
He's on the Roman side.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.535 align:middle line:84%
So these acquaintances
would have

00:43:16.535 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:90%
been the rebels in Jerusalem.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And so he saw
three acquaintances

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:27.350 align:middle line:84%
on crosses being crucified
in the remains of Jerusalem.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And he asked a special favor
for them to be taken down.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.400 align:middle line:90%
And they were taken down.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And only one survived.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a story
about three people

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:46.650 align:middle line:84%
being on a cross,
who were associates

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:90%
or previous friends of Josephus.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Only one of them survived.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And the person who takes them
down from the cross, of course,

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:00.980 align:middle line:90%
was called Josephus, Joseph.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And here, I think, we
probably see a link

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.280 align:middle line:84%
into a biblical history
because, of course,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.370 align:middle line:84%
the person who took
Jesus down from the cross

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.830 align:middle line:90%
was called Joseph of Arimathea.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be an
incredibly similar story,

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that I think it is
most probably linked.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we're just
looking at a different era.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.080 align:middle line:84%
This didn't happen
in A.D 30 or 33.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.160 align:middle line:84%
This business with Jesus'
resurrection in A.D. 30,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.244 align:middle line:84%
33, was a simple Masonic
third degree raising

00:44:30.244 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Thirty-third degree, yeah.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a third
degree razor, same

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
as any Mason would
go through today,

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
where they symbolically die, and
they are raised from the dead.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So yes, these events
were not from that era.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:84%
These were from A.D. 70,
destruction of Jerusalem,

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:53.330 align:middle line:84%
a major event, which is
strangely absent from the New

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Testament, very
strangely absent.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Why is it missing?

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.420 align:middle line:84%
This was the most
upsetting event

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:84%
in the whole of Judaic history,
and yet it's not there.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's been
sort of slipped in,

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.170 align:middle line:90%
in a slightly different era.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to look at
the true story of the New

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Testament, you have to go
to the Jewish War, which

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:90%
was a book written by Josephus.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And it follows the same
sort of chronology,

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:84%
the same people,
the same events.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's just taken from
a secular viewpoint,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of a
religious viewpoint.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So we've got these two
books were written.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
One was a religious book
of this era and the events.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And one was a secular one.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:84%
One was written for his new
church, the Church of Saul.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the other was
written for the Romans

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.540 align:middle line:84%
because the Romans wanted
a history of this era.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And so he wrote two books.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:90%
One was secular.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.200 align:middle line:90%
One was religious.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And they went to
different people.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>And so the one of the three
that survived may have been--

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>May have been--

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>May have been Jesus.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>But remember, of course,
this Jesus in this era

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.290 align:middle line:84%
would have been 65
years old, of course.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.290 align:middle line:90%
He already had children.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.081 align:middle line:84%
>>He already had his
family, the bloodline.

00:46:11.081 --> 00:46:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>We don't need him
to survive in order

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:15.170 align:middle line:90%
to maintain the bloodline.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:90%
We know that he had children.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:84%
At least, we can be as
fairly sure as we can.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:84%
There's an interesting
confrontation between Saul

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and someone called
Jesus on his travels.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And he has this violent
argument with this guy,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.230 align:middle line:90%
and ends up blinding him.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.477 align:middle line:84%
Why did he have an
argument with this guy?

00:46:37.477 --> 00:46:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Why was he so upset?

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, his name was
Jesus, of course.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing Saul
wanted on his travels

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.360 align:middle line:84%
around the Mediterranean
was someone

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.660 align:middle line:84%
called Jesus, a son of Jesus,
he was called Ben Jesus,

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.260 align:middle line:84%
saying that what you're
saying is rubbish.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is effectively
what this guy was saying.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe it.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.430 align:middle line:84%
What Saul is telling
you is rubbish.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.130 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen that way.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why he had an argument
with this particular person.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And this particular person was
called Ben Jesus, son of Jesus.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty sure that he
did have sons and daughters.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them,
of course, would

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:22.770 align:middle line:84%
have escaped either prior to
the destruction of Jerusalem

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.020 align:middle line:90%
or after.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And they would have gone off,
maybe to the South of France.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And hence, we have
all the stories

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:34.220 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Magdalene in
the South of France.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.740 align:middle line:90%
What a journey.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're going
to wrap it up there.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, I will
highly encourage

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.140 align:middle line:84%
any of you viewing this to
purchase a copy of the books

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.110 align:middle line:90%
and dig in.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating research.

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, we're in a
time where, in my opinion,

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.330 align:middle line:90%
everything is up for review.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Indeed, it is.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:47:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I hope you've
enjoyed this interview.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.500 align:middle line:84%
As I've said before,
everything is up for review

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.300 align:middle line:84%
as new information
begins surfacing

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.620 align:middle line:84%
as to our histories
and religions.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.380 align:middle line:84%
If you want to continue
along this thread,

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.100 align:middle line:84%
you may also enjoy my
interview with Acharya S.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:28.544 align:middle line:90%
