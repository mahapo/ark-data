00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.921
<v ->If you're an astrology junkie
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.162
you've likely seen Rick Levine's daily takes

3
00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:07.277
on the homepages of Google, MySpace or AOL.

4
00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:09.271
If you're not an astrology enthusiast,

5
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.343
this is the best way to meet Rick for the first time.

6
00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:15.500
For him, the cycles of the cosmos speak much more deeply

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.359
than the simply predictions made by many astrologers.

8
00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.484
He even goes so far as to say the predictions themselves

9
00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:22.956
help manifest the reality,

10
00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.801
which is not the purpose of astrology.

11
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.566
(ethereal music)

12
00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:36.480
I was listening to your talk and you were telling about

13
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.774
a sign you have in your office which, of course,

14
00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:40.171
got a good chuckle and I love,

15
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:43.368
"Exercise the illusion of freewill."

16
00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.367
And I wanted to talk to you about that because

17
00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:48.614
this whole notion about astrology,

18
00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.466
you know, cycles of time,

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.237
fate versus freewill,

20
00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:55.575
this is a huge conundrum for mankind in general.

21
00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:56.828
What is it?

22
00:00:56.828 --> 00:01:01.007
<v ->Well, interestingly enough it's the same conundrum</v>

23
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.071
as scientists have asked or puzzled about for years.

24
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:09.770
It's the paradox of the particle wave duality.

25
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.384
Often people think fate or freewill.

26
00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:19.098
Well, I'm old enough to remember a commercial for Certs

27
00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:22.072
that was, "Is Certs a candy mint or is it

28
00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:23.228
a breath mint?"
<v Voiceover>It's two mints</v>

29
00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:23.975
in one.

30
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:26.740
<v ->And, the universe is two universes in one.</v>

31
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.134
<v ->Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:30.099
<v ->It's a universe of particle and wave.</v>

33
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.766
It's a universe of fate and freewill.

34
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:37.766
And as Werner Heisenberg discovered as we,

35
00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:43.124
or as scientists in the early 20th century begin to

36
00:01:43.124 --> 00:01:46.462
delve into the mysteries of the subatomic realities,

37
00:01:46.462 --> 00:01:50.206
Heisenberg discovered that the subatomic particles

38
00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:53.698
didn't conform to the laws of Newtonian gravitational

39
00:01:53.698 --> 00:01:55.181
cause and effect.

40
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.347
And that, in fact,

41
00:01:57.347 --> 00:02:02.347
there was an uncertainty that occurred from our perception

42
00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.098
of these very tiny worlds--

43
00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:04.812
<v ->Right.</v>

44
00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.383
<v ->because it would almost be,</v>

45
00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:10.112
Fred Alan Wolf talks about going into a little elf house

46
00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:11.853
and to see what that's like.

47
00:02:11.853 --> 00:02:13.316
Except when you're in there,

48
00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.357
just moving your elbow breaks out a wall.

49
00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:18.512
And the little elves are all running around fearful

50
00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:20.486
of how big you are and whatever.

51
00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:22.896
And by the same token,

52
00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:25.712
when we look at the subatomic universe

53
00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:28.685
we infringe this hugeness on it that alters it.

54
00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:29.133
<v ->Right.</v>

55
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:34.133
<v ->So that the observer then becomes part of what's observed</v>

56
00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:35.712
because it's not clean.

57
00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:36.927
We're not looking at it,

58
00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:39.692
we're interacting with it whether we know it or not.

59
00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:42.951
Now, what does that have to do with fate and freewill?

60
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:44.669
<v ->When you observe it, it becomes...</v>

61
00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.495
<v ->Well, that's it really.</v>

62
00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:51.885
Because what happens is that in the subatomic realm

63
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:58.706
reality is propagated by waves.

64
00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:02.063
Light travels as if it's a waveform.

65
00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:03.384
But when we look at it,

66
00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:06.368
for that moment that we go to measure it,

67
00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:08.792
in the words of the physicist Fred Alan Wolf,

68
00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:10.957
"The quantum wave function collapses."

69
00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.280
He calls it a QWF,

70
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.581
a quantum wave function.

71
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:14.972
QWF.

72
00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:16.541
<v ->Quantum wave function.</v>

73
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.890
And the collapse of the quantum wave function

74
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.860
turns a wave for a moment of observation into a particle.

75
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

76
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.279
<v ->Now, what happens is that we live in</v>

77
00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.023
a quantum field of waves.

78
00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:34.466
I can hear Deepak Chopra saying,

79
00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:37.761
"We live in a world of indeterminate particles and waves

80
00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:38.465
"and every--,"

81
00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:41.079
you know, this whole idea of the free floating end of it.

82
00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:41.839
<v Voiceover>Field of potential.</v>

83
00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:42.991
<v ->The field of potential.</v>

84
00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:44.610
"The Field."
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.674
<v ->Lynne McTaggart's, "The Field."</v>

86
00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:51.420
But when we talk about what's happening,

87
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.298
whether we're an astrologer or not,

88
00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:54.301
when we talk about,

89
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.826
"So, how's your life going?"

90
00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.799
At that moment you tell me a story.

91
00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.546
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

92
00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:01.271
<v ->And I love Muriel Rukeyser once wrote,</v>

93
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:03.948
"The world consists of stories, not of atoms."

94
00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:06.658
(chuckling)
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

95
00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:09.495
<v ->But what happens when we tell a story is we take</v>

96
00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:13.537
the indeterminacy of all the possibilities of our life

97
00:04:13.537 --> 00:04:15.176
and in that split second
<v Voiceover>You collapsed it</v>

98
00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:16.751
(clap)
<v ->Pop.</v>

99
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:19.332
We've popped the quantum wave function into a particle.

100
00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:20.305
<v Voiceover>Something observable.</v>

101
00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:21.371
<v ->Observable.</v>

102
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:22.219
Exactly.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.866
<v ->Now, as an astrologer,</v>

104
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.232
let me just preface this by saying that

105
00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:30.768
in the field of astrology,

106
00:04:30.768 --> 00:04:33.926
there's a hold spectrum of perception around

107
00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:35.824
fate versus freewill.

108
00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:40.325
There are those astrologers who are very deeply ingrained

109
00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:45.325
in the Greek Hellenistic, medieval astrology where

110
00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:48.887
things are predetermined.

111
00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:52.072
There are Vedic astrologers who practice Jyotisha,

112
00:04:52.072 --> 00:04:54.504
which is the science of light.

113
00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:57.069
Kind of like the correspondence of Ayurvedic,

114
00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.139
which is the science of the body.

115
00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.084
Jyotisha is the other side of the coin which is astrology,

116
00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:05.497
and the two of those together mesh into, you know,

117
00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:09.166
body and light or Forman light.

118
00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:12.009
But most Vedic astrologers also say that

119
00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.196
our lives are predetermined.

120
00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:16.788
And that when you look at a chart,

121
00:05:16.788 --> 00:05:20.158
you see that predetermination and you can ameliorate

122
00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:22.066
some of the energies or work with them.

123
00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:24.786
But again, it's very fated.

124
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:28.145
I believe that that sense of fatedness comes out of

125
00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:31.969
the world in which that astrology was born in

126
00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.540
a caste system where there was really no room for

127
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.462
personal movement or development.

128
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.216
It was just as it was.

129
00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:42.679
You were bound by the world you were born into.

130
00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:44.748
As you were in the ancient world,

131
00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:49.457
as you were if you were born into 15th century England,

132
00:05:49.457 --> 00:05:51.520
you never left your village.

133
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.344
You know, you were born into a place.

134
00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:54.741
You did what you were told.

135
00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:59.741
You maybe were, you know, drafted in a bar

136
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.952
by the English Navy and spent three or five

137
00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:04.510
or eight years on a ship.

138
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.922
And if you were lucky, you made it back to your town,

139
00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:08.435
but then you lived out your life there.

140
00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:09.501
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

141
00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:13.485
These days it's very different.

142
00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:16.202
When people ask me if I believe in reincarnation I go,

143
00:06:16.202 --> 00:06:18.623
"Sure. I've had several lifetimes in this body."

144
00:06:18.623 --> 00:06:19.434
(chuckle)

145
00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:22.916
It's very different now than it once was because

146
00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:27.576
very few of us live the same life into which we were born.

147
00:06:27.576 --> 00:06:30.228
So, you can say that may be fated,

148
00:06:30.228 --> 00:06:33.012
but there also seems to be an element of freewill

149
00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:36.560
that we have more so than our ancestors did because

150
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.586
we have more metaphysical mobility.

151
00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:39.397
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v Rick>We have more</v>

152
00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:40.131
information.

153
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.499
So, coming back full circle to the question of

154
00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:44.802
fate versus freewill,

155
00:06:44.802 --> 00:06:47.682
when I look at a chart as an astrologer,

156
00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:49.420
I see a pattern,

157
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.111
I see a picture of the energetic potential that

158
00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:55.414
you have at the moment when that you were born.

159
00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.526
You carry that throughout your life.

160
00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:02.443
As long as you are living in this particular meat body

161
00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:03.412
that you've chosen--

162
00:07:03.412 --> 00:07:05.854
<v Voiceover>And again, potential's the operative word.</v>

163
00:07:05.854 --> 00:07:07.870
<v ->Potential is the operative word.</v>

164
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.870
Unconsciously, you will take the lowest common denominator

165
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.781
and live out what an astrologer might consider the fate

166
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:17.907
of your chart.

167
00:07:17.907 --> 00:07:18.973
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

168
00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:22.423
<v ->But consciously, you can do anything.</v>

169
00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:24.460
Now, here's an interesting concept,

170
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.156
as a sailor,

171
00:07:26.156 --> 00:07:29.450
if the wind is blowing this way, toward me,

172
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.192
and I don't know I'm doing and I get into my sailing ship,

173
00:07:32.192 --> 00:07:33.237
the wind's going to blow me right

174
00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.713
against that wall.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

175
00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:36.639
<v ->It's going to blow me into the rocks because</v>

176
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.103
I'm at the whim of whatever which way,

177
00:07:39.103 --> 00:07:41.140
whatever way the wind is blowing.

178
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.562
But if I'm an accomplished sailor,

179
00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.446
doesn't matter which way the wind is blowing.

180
00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:48.133
If I have wind, I can go any direction I want.

181
00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:51.706
And in fact, a good sailor, by tacking,

182
00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:54.704
can go faster not in the direction of the wind.

183
00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:55.828
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

184
00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:57.119
<v ->But you have to be conscious.</v>

185
00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:58.676
You have to know

186
00:07:58.676 --> 00:07:59.569
how to use the wind
<v Voiceover>How to use</v>

187
00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:00.316
<v Rick>the energy.</v>
<v Voiceover>How to use</v>

188
00:08:00.316 --> 00:08:00.856
the energy--

189
00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.812
<v ->So, when you look at a chart</v>

190
00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:06.470
you can see the fated potential if there's

191
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.593
no conscious intervention.

192
00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:12.401
But, it's not which way the wind blows that determines

193
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.160
the fate of the soul.

194
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.966
It's the intention and the consciousness.

195
00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:21.381
And therefore, we do have a way not so much to overcome it,

196
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:22.032
we don't,

197
00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:25.161
I still have, you know, the fate.

198
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:27.429
The Greek said there were three kinds of fate.

199
00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:31.890
There was Heimarmene which is a Greek word

200
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.979
which means the fate of those things I can't change.

201
00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:36.034
If I lift up an object

202
00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:36.978
and drop it, (thump)
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

203
00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:37.992
<v ->It's going to hit the table.</v>

204
00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:38.525
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

205
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:39.804
<v ->It's the fate of that object.</v>

206
00:08:39.804 --> 00:08:40.497
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

207
00:08:40.497 --> 00:08:42.482
<v ->I live in a body, I'm gonna die.</v>

208
00:08:42.482 --> 00:08:44.658
It's the fate of this object or the physically

209
00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:45.586
I'm going to die.

210
00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:48.307
So, these are the things that we can't change.

211
00:08:48.307 --> 00:08:51.325
The second kind of fate is Agonia.

212
00:08:51.325 --> 00:08:52.911
This is the fate of not knowing.

213
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.097
If my eyes are closed and I'm running that way,

214
00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:56.477
I'm going to hit the wall and it hurts.

215
00:08:56.477 --> 00:08:57.070
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>

216
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.067
<v ->If I'm, you know, walking this way and</v>

217
00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:01.348
I don't see the cliff,

218
00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:03.001
I'll fall off the cliff and die.

219
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:03.855
Agonia.

220
00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:05.369
It's the fate of not being aware.

221
00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:06.575
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

222
00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:08.921
<v ->The third kind of fate is Pronoia.</v>

223
00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:13.347
In a way, it's the co-creation of your reality because

224
00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:14.627
you can know what's coming.

225
00:09:14.627 --> 00:09:15.235
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

226
00:09:15.235 --> 00:09:17.118
<v ->Doesn't mean that you're creating the reality,</v>

227
00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:18.206
that's a bit tricky.

228
00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:19.880
What it means is that you know which way

229
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.851
the wind is blowing,

230
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.495
you have a sense of how to work with it,

231
00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:23.519
and therefore,

232
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.610
I mean real magic isn't making something happen

233
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.708
out of the blue,

234
00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:29.311
it's taking all the forces that are currently at work

235
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:31.229
and almost like an Aikido Master,

236
00:09:31.229 --> 00:09:33.089
taking them in, transforming them,

237
00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:34.233
and running them through the system and

238
00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:35.935
making something happen at the other end.

239
00:09:35.935 --> 00:09:36.767
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

240
00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:38.377
<v ->And so in a way,</v>

241
00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:42.548
when I look at a chart of a client or of a moment in time,

242
00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:45.705
of whether it's election day or 2012 or a chart for

243
00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:47.731
the bombing of the World Trade Tower

244
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:50.398
or the beginning of World War II or any chart

245
00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:52.883
of any event or any person,

246
00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:57.653
what I'm looking at is a bunch of points.

247
00:09:57.653 --> 00:10:00.550
Planets mapped at a particular point

248
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.969
because I'm taking a measurement,

249
00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.547
so the quantum wave function (clap)

250
00:10:03.547 --> 00:10:05.480
is collapsed into a fated moment.

251
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.845
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

252
00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:07.965
<v ->But as soon as I look away,</v>

253
00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:09.426
all those planets are moving.

254
00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:10.580
They're all moving in their own speed

255
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.997
and their own direction.

256
00:10:11.997 --> 00:10:13.590
And so, by the same token,

257
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.310
if you as a client come to me and I look at your chart

258
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.579
and I go, "Holy smokes!

259
00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:20.529
"The Moon in your chart is at 23 degrees of Virgo

260
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:22.566
"and Saturn takes 30 years to go around,

261
00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:24.649
"and next year Saturn's going to line up with your Moon.

262
00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:27.060
"Oh my, God. You're going to get divorced."

263
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.577
I've just (clap) popped the quantum

264
00:10:29.577 --> 00:10:30.243
wave function.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

265
00:10:30.243 --> 00:10:31.831
You collapse that into--
<v Rick>The problem--</v>

266
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Voiceover>Haven't you collapsed it into</v>

267
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.608
a programmable reality?

268
00:10:34.608 --> 00:10:37.350
<v ->I have and I've programmed it with my bias.</v>

269
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.117
<v Voiceover>Yes, your bias.</v>
<v Rick>Which is</v>

270
00:10:38.117 --> 00:10:39.671
<v Rick>very dangerous.</v>
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

271
00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:40.440
Predictive astrology.

272
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.655
<v ->Predictive astrology can be very dangerous because</v>

273
00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:45.028
there's a homeopathic effect.

274
00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

275
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.118
<v ->Homeopathy, as you probably know,</v>

276
00:10:47.118 --> 00:10:48.724
is the treatment of like with like.

277
00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:49.073
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

278
00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:51.742
<v ->And it takes very little energy to drive</v>

279
00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:53.203
a resonant circuit.

280
00:10:53.203 --> 00:10:53.641
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

281
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:56.584
<v ->Which is why on crystal radio I can pick up a station</v>

282
00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:58.632
thousands of miles away because it's the

283
00:10:58.632 --> 00:11:00.214
exact same frequency.

284
00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:00.744
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

285
00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:02.945
So, by the same token, in homeopathy,

286
00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.488
the less physical substance there is in the remedy,

287
00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:06.896
the stronger the remedy is if
<v Voiceover>If it's</v>

288
00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:07.752
it's the right one.
<v Voiceover>potentized.</v>

289
00:11:07.752 --> 00:11:08.445
Yes.

290
00:11:08.445 --> 00:11:08.900
<v ->Potentized.</v>

291
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.497
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

292
00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:10.425
<v ->By the same token,</v>

293
00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:12.492
if I'm looking at your chart

294
00:11:12.492 --> 00:11:16.298
I can deliver a homeopathic remedy by my voice.

295
00:11:16.298 --> 00:11:17.620
No physical substance at all.

296
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.260
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

297
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.494
It's incredibly potent if it's symbolically accurate.

298
00:11:22.494 --> 00:11:24.691
So, if I say something about this prediction,

299
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.347
you're getting divorced in a year,

300
00:11:27.347 --> 00:11:28.856
you might say, "No, my marriage is great

301
00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:29.869
"and everything is fine."

302
00:11:29.869 --> 00:11:31.994
But there's symbolism going on

303
00:11:31.994 --> 00:11:32.383
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

304
00:11:32.383 --> 00:11:34.715
<v ->and something begins to stir in your unconscious</v>

305
00:11:34.715 --> 00:11:35.286
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

306
00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:39.212
<v ->And it can, in fact, manifest as my prediction</v>

307
00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:43.222
because I have planted almost like a hook for

308
00:11:43.222 --> 00:11:45.078
the subconscious mind to go, "That's it!"

309
00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:46.006
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

310
00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:47.521
<v ->And so from that standpoint,</v>

311
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:51.446
what I've done is I've popped your quantum wave function.

312
00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:55.318
I've particularized your waveform.

313
00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:56.992
<v Voiceover>Well, let's talk about those same aspects.</v>

314
00:11:56.992 --> 00:11:58.608
You see that in the chart--

315
00:11:58.608 --> 00:11:59.397
<v ->Well now, we--</v>

316
00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:00.551
<v Voiceover>Now, how would you responsibly</v>

317
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:02.019
render that information?

318
00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:05.842
<v ->Perfect question and it's a large part of what my work is</v>

319
00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:07.986
not only as counseling astrologer,

320
00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:11.538
but also as a teacher of other astrologers which I spend

321
00:12:11.538 --> 00:12:14.087
a fair mount of my time doing.

322
00:12:14.087 --> 00:12:17.735
And that is coming up with language that is not sloppy.

323
00:12:17.735 --> 00:12:20.550
This is not an excuse for being a sloppy astrologer.

324
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.769
But the fact is the Moon is our connection to the matrix.

325
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:26.601
It's the planet of nurturing.

326
00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:27.740
It's mothering.

327
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.804
The Moon is the mother.

328
00:12:28.804 --> 00:12:29.879
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

329
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.235
<v ->The Moon is our feelings.</v>

330
00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:32.728
It's our subconscious mind.

331
00:12:32.728 --> 00:12:35.715
It's our intuition.

332
00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:38.317
Saturn, on the other hand, is cold and calulating

333
00:12:38.317 --> 00:12:42.381
and authoritative and determined and hard.

334
00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:44.376
So, when the hard energy of Saturn meets

335
00:12:44.376 --> 00:12:46.012
the soft energy of the Moon,

336
00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:47.612
there's often a difficulty.

337
00:12:47.612 --> 00:12:50.609
We often feel out of place.

338
00:12:50.609 --> 00:12:52.317
So, the question becomes,

339
00:12:52.317 --> 00:12:53.735
where in your life now,

340
00:12:53.735 --> 00:12:56.103
assuming that this aspect is going to be exact

341
00:12:56.103 --> 00:12:57.588
in your chart in a year,

342
00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:00.088
where in your life are you feeling this energy

343
00:13:00.088 --> 00:13:02.274
of feeling like you're not being noticed or that

344
00:13:02.274 --> 00:13:04.802
you can't breathe deeply and feel what you're feeling?

345
00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:08.407
Because Saturn, authorities, structures, rules, commitments,

346
00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:11.553
are in some way holding you in or restraining you.

347
00:13:11.553 --> 00:13:11.990
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

348
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.641
<v ->And how can you look at those and begin a dialogue</v>

349
00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:18.769
with that part of your life, internally and externally,

350
00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:23.164
so that you can begin to grow through that and like

351
00:13:23.164 --> 00:13:25.606
a snake that sheds its skin,

352
00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:30.606
use this transit to gain new freedom without necessarily

353
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.062
taking down the structures that you have.

354
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:33.617
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

355
00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:35.035
<v ->There are times in our lives when taking down</v>

356
00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:36.358
the structures is important.

357
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:36.891
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

358
00:13:36.891 --> 00:13:39.027
<v ->But there's also times when it's not the</v>

359
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.157
smartest thing to do.

360
00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:42.365
That becomes your decision.

361
00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:44.733
Going back to the divorce aspect that

362
00:13:44.733 --> 00:13:45.970
I was just talking about,

363
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.661
the question would be, how can you begin in a dialogue now

364
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.837
with your spouse, with your partner,

365
00:13:51.837 --> 00:13:55.303
to talk about the issues that you feel are pressing on you

366
00:13:55.303 --> 00:13:58.151
so that you can negotiate a way to move through it

367
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:00.359
rather than staying in denial about it.

368
00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:02.987
Waiting until it's too late and coming home one day

369
00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:04.855
and leaving the note on the refrigerator.

370
00:14:04.855 --> 00:14:07.465
<v Voiceover>Well, and this is the real opportunity then</v>

371
00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:12.461
in understanding this clock of some kind as

372
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:15.339
movement of forces through our lives

373
00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:17.771
is being able to utilize it in this way.

374
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:20.757
This sounds like a responsible use of that

375
00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:22.261
movement of energies.

376
00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:23.540
<v ->Well, I think so.</v>

377
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.296
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

378
00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:29.296
<v ->I have contemporary associate astrologers who would say</v>

379
00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:32.445
that I'm shirking my duty as an astrologer.

380
00:14:32.445 --> 00:14:34.237
The client wants the prediction.

381
00:14:34.237 --> 00:14:35.091
<v Voiceover>Okay, now wait a minute.</v>

382
00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:36.355
Let me ask you a question.

383
00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:37.327
You have,

384
00:14:37.327 --> 00:14:39.790
your astrology column is on the homepage of

385
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.902
Google and MySpace and AOL,

386
00:14:41.902 --> 00:14:44.291
that has to be fairly predictive, doesn't it?

387
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:46.622
Is that kind of like your daily bite so to speak?

388
00:14:46.622 --> 00:14:47.604
<v ->Yeah, yeah--
<v Voiceover>How does that</v>

389
00:14:47.604 --> 00:14:48.944
fit in with all of this?

390
00:14:48.944 --> 00:14:49.989
<v ->I write a thousand words a day.</v>

391
00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:50.939
Seven days a week.

392
00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:52.538
And I've been doing it now for eight years.

393
00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:53.264
<v Voiceover>It's amazing.</v>

394
00:14:53.264 --> 00:14:55.749
<v ->I have in the range of 10 to 15 million readers a day.</v>

395
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:56.741
<v Voiceover>I know. It's just amazing.</v>

396
00:14:56.741 --> 00:14:57.387
<v Rick>Now,</v>
<v Voiceover>So, now what</v>

397
00:14:57.387 --> 00:14:58.126
are you doing with that?

398
00:14:58.126 --> 00:15:02.190
<v ->Well, what I do is I write about a hundred words</v>

399
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.099
of what I call overview.

400
00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:05.891
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

401
00:15:05.891 --> 00:15:10.065
<v ->The overview is basically a description of the weather.</v>

402
00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:10.833
Okay.

403
00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:14.324
So, I'll use a metaphor.

404
00:15:14.324 --> 00:15:18.738
If I was writing a week ago about yesterday

405
00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:20.615
here in San Francisco,

406
00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:24.375
I might say astrologically this looks like a day of rain.

407
00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:25.883
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

408
00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.600
<v ->Now, if...</v>

409
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.853
And then I discuss that weather through

410
00:15:30.853 --> 00:15:32.485
12 different lenses.

411
00:15:32.485 --> 00:15:35.130
12 archetypes, the signs.

412
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.821
And it's not just, you know, whatever your sign is,

413
00:15:38.821 --> 00:15:40.174
you're a Scorpio, you're a Virgo,

414
00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:42.322
you're a whatever.

415
00:15:42.322 --> 00:15:45.061
But there's just 12 different ways to frame the universe

416
00:15:45.061 --> 00:15:48.826
and we're all, all 12 signs truly.

417
00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:51.327
Though unconsciously we lean towards one.

418
00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:51.664
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

419
00:15:51.664 --> 00:15:53.733
<v ->That comes back to that fate versus freewill.</v>

420
00:15:53.733 --> 00:15:55.042
When we're not paying attention,

421
00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:58.829
we go to typically either our Sun sign,

422
00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:00.935
the time of the year that you were born,

423
00:16:00.935 --> 00:16:03.499
or some other facet of our chart.

424
00:16:03.499 --> 00:16:05.097
There's a Moon sign in Mercury and Venus.

425
00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.103
I mean it's more complicated then

426
00:16:07.103 --> 00:16:08.069
just the one and 12th.
<v Voiceover>So, let's say</v>

427
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:10.229
we're just going with say our Scorpio Sun sign.

428
00:16:10.229 --> 00:16:12.353
It's calling for rain in San Francisco,

429
00:16:12.353 --> 00:16:13.707
how is this going to play itself

430
00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:14.913
out in my field?
<v Rick>Okay. So,</v>

431
00:16:14.913 --> 00:16:15.724
<v Voiceover>Is that one of--</v>
<v Rick>Yes.</v>

432
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:17.330
(chuckles)
So, here's the thing.

433
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.729
If you're a Leo and love the Sun,

434
00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:20.593
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

435
00:16:20.593 --> 00:16:23.376
<v ->It might not be a fun day for you because you were</v>

436
00:16:23.376 --> 00:16:25.024
planning on going to the beach.

437
00:16:25.024 --> 00:16:26.763
Now, if you didn't know it was going to rain,

438
00:16:26.763 --> 00:16:29.941
you'd be there at the beach with your suntan lotion going,

439
00:16:29.941 --> 00:16:30.826
"Life sucks."

440
00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:31.584
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

441
00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:33.314
<v ->But if you knew it was going to rain,</v>

442
00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:36.396
you might reschedule that day and spend a day

443
00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:38.112
going to the movies.

444
00:16:38.112 --> 00:16:39.235
On the other hand,

445
00:16:39.235 --> 00:16:43.202
if you were a water sign like a Scorpio or

446
00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.938
a Cancer or a Pisces,

447
00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:46.346
or if you were a duck,

448
00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:48.021
you might go, "It's raining out.

449
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:49.503
"What a great day to go to the beach.

450
00:16:49.503 --> 00:16:51.316
"No one's going to be there but me."

451
00:16:51.316 --> 00:16:52.020
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

452
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.122
<v ->"I love those quiet, solemn, deep, heavy days</v>

453
00:16:55.122 --> 00:16:56.018
"at the beach.

454
00:16:56.018 --> 00:16:57.084
"I don't need the damn Sun."

455
00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:57.713
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

456
00:16:57.713 --> 00:17:01.489
<v ->You see so we have different ways of reacting with</v>

457
00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:03.420
our external environment.

458
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.039
And so, in my daily column,

459
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:09.561
what I try to do is first describe the cosmic weather.

460
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:13.581
For example, we're coming into election day here now.

461
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:17.154
We're talking the Sunday before election day.

462
00:17:17.154 --> 00:17:22.103
And we're coming into a pretty potent aspect that is

463
00:17:22.103 --> 00:17:23.095
Saturn and Uranus.

464
00:17:23.095 --> 00:17:24.652
Saturn, the planet of restriction that we

465
00:17:24.652 --> 00:17:26.391
talked about earlier, and Uranus,

466
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:28.972
the plant of breaking through restriction.

467
00:17:28.972 --> 00:17:30.593
Now, I don't know who's going to win the election.

468
00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:32.602
I certainly have my biases,

469
00:17:32.602 --> 00:17:36.527
but it's obvious that these two forces are standing off.

470
00:17:36.527 --> 00:17:38.735
Now, for someone,

471
00:17:38.735 --> 00:17:43.735
maybe a Capricorn, that is more Saturn oriented,

472
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:47.200
they may be very fearful of what could happen.

473
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.209
And therefore, they may pull in and constrict

474
00:17:50.209 --> 00:17:53.371
and hold something like this.

475
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:55.557
And so, that day may be very difficult for them

476
00:17:55.557 --> 00:17:57.872
if the world is exploding and it's not

477
00:17:57.872 --> 00:17:59.365
what it's supposed to be.

478
00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:00.613
On the other hand,

479
00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:03.429
an Aries or an Aquarius, as an example,

480
00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:06.906
may be much more interested in not the status quo,

481
00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:08.975
but whatever's happening next, "Oh, this is cool.

482
00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:10.831
"Things are screwed. I'm in!"

483
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:11.556
You know?
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

484
00:18:11.556 --> 00:18:14.521
<v ->And so, again, what I try to do everyday is for</v>

485
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:16.239
each of the 12 signs,

486
00:18:16.239 --> 00:18:20.238
describe a possible scenario of how you might react

487
00:18:20.238 --> 00:18:22.468
to what's going on and then,

488
00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.323
and I think this is the key thing and one of the things

489
00:18:24.323 --> 00:18:27.043
that makes my column substantially different than

490
00:18:27.043 --> 00:18:29.571
many of the others, I always try to say,

491
00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:33.493
"Here's something that you might try to do as a practice."

492
00:18:33.493 --> 00:18:33.950
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

493
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.763
<v ->I don't use those words around it,</v>

494
00:18:35.763 --> 00:18:38.269
but if you read the column there's always,

495
00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:40.862
I have people who write and say they love my column

496
00:18:40.862 --> 00:18:42.110
and blah blah blah blah.

497
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.664
In the same day I'll have someone write and say,

498
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.758
"I hate your column. It's always so negative."

499
00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:47.046
I love that because its,

500
00:18:47.046 --> 00:18:49.507
and part of the thing is that I don't just write

501
00:18:49.507 --> 00:18:51.001
the goodie goodie stuff,

502
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.667
I try to describe an energy that's difficult,

503
00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:56.291
and then I try to describe how we might work

504
00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:57.294
with that energy.

505
00:18:57.294 --> 00:18:58.702
That's my approach.

506
00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:01.101
<v Voiceover>Now, with the energies intensifying</v>

507
00:19:01.101 --> 00:19:02.371
in general these days.

508
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:05.901
The feeling that time is speeding up that life is

509
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:08.152
demanding our attention and some,

510
00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:10.221
not just discretion but wisdom and so forth.

511
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:12.034
Are you finding that more people are turning to

512
00:19:12.034 --> 00:19:16.461
these larger cycles and tools such as astrology?

513
00:19:16.461 --> 00:19:18.561
<v ->Yeah. (laughs)</v>

514
00:19:18.561 --> 00:19:19.479
<v Voiceover>Yeah. I mean</v>

515
00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:21.111
you can tell by book sales and log ons.

516
00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:21.623
<v ->No.</v>

517
00:19:21.623 --> 00:19:23.024
<v Voiceover>Is it ratcheting up?</v>

518
00:19:23.024 --> 00:19:23.525
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

519
00:19:23.525 --> 00:19:26.767
But in all honesty, it has been pretty steadily

520
00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:28.346
since the 1960s.

521
00:19:28.346 --> 00:19:29.209
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

522
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:31.547
<v ->And yet in the past 10 years it's taken another,</v>

523
00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:34.779
several leaps and there's a lot of reasons for that.

524
00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:37.915
A lot of my contemporaries (burp),

525
00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:41.925
excuse me, who begin seriously studying astrology

526
00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:42.885
in the '60s,

527
00:19:42.885 --> 00:19:46.064
I was a college student in the late '60s.

528
00:19:46.064 --> 00:19:49.130
And I got into astrology through an academic degree

529
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.492
in psychology, through an interest in Freud

530
00:19:51.492 --> 00:19:54.372
and Young and archetypal psychology,

531
00:19:54.372 --> 00:19:56.681
and depth psychology.

532
00:19:56.681 --> 00:19:59.171
And, as many of my contemporaries have,

533
00:19:59.171 --> 00:20:01.541
I also at that time became acquainted with a lot of

534
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:06.541
the Asian Eastern philosophies and religions.

535
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.430
And my work in astrology, as many of my contemporaries,

536
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:15.430
have lead to a renaissance of publishing.

537
00:20:16.638 --> 00:20:18.152
Today if you were to say,

538
00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:20.008
"I'm interested in as in astrology,"

539
00:20:20.008 --> 00:20:21.928
there would be thousands of books.

540
00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:22.515
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

541
00:20:22.515 --> 00:20:26.131
<v ->And many written by very intelligent people.</v>

542
00:20:26.131 --> 00:20:28.699
PhDs and--

543
00:20:28.699 --> 00:20:29.332
<v Voiceover>True.</v>

544
00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:30.655
<v ->And deep academic books.</v>

545
00:20:30.655 --> 00:20:32.532
Books on all sorts of, you know,

546
00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:34.815
whether it's economic cycles, psychological,

547
00:20:34.815 --> 00:20:37.022
spiritual, historical.

548
00:20:37.022 --> 00:20:40.409
I mean the amount of work out there is incredible.

549
00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:42.171
In the '60s there were only like eight books.

550
00:20:42.171 --> 00:20:43.324
I'm exaggerating a little bit.

551
00:20:43.324 --> 00:20:44.349
<v Voiceover>"Love Signs."</v>

552
00:20:44.349 --> 00:20:45.663
(laughs)
<v ->My first book.</v>

553
00:20:45.663 --> 00:20:49.062
<v Voiceover>Yeah. No, great.</v>

554
00:20:49.062 --> 00:20:50.453
<v ->Well actually it was not "Love Signs,"</v>

555
00:20:50.453 --> 00:20:51.744
it was Linda Goodman's first book,

556
00:20:51.744 --> 00:20:52.195
"Sun Signs."
<v Voiceover>Before</v>

557
00:20:52.195 --> 00:20:52.772
"Love Signs."

558
00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:53.583
Right. Exactly.

559
00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:54.472
<v ->And...</v>

560
00:20:54.472 --> 00:20:58.075
But the thing is that it has changed substantially.

561
00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:00.742
What used to be three books on a shelf at Barnes &amp; Noble

562
00:21:00.742 --> 00:21:01.766
is now two shelves.

563
00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:02.342
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

564
00:21:02.342 --> 00:21:06.052
<v ->And so, from that standpoint not only in the</v>

565
00:21:06.052 --> 00:21:08.399
publishing world, in the print media,

566
00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:09.795
you know, dead tree world.

567
00:21:09.795 --> 00:21:10.149
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

568
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:11.453
<v ->But also on the internet.</v>

569
00:21:11.453 --> 00:21:11.781
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

570
00:21:11.781 --> 00:21:15.685
<v ->You have just amazing growth of communities and chats</v>

571
00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:20.602
and user groups and websites of people who are

572
00:21:20.602 --> 00:21:22.814
studying astrology and wanting more information

573
00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:25.346
and finding that there are people, intelligent people,

574
00:21:25.346 --> 00:21:26.487
all over the world.

575
00:21:26.487 --> 00:21:29.687
I mean the fact is that in my professional life

576
00:21:29.687 --> 00:21:32.311
I've spent time in the telecommunications industry.

577
00:21:32.311 --> 00:21:34.402
I've spent time in the computer industry.

578
00:21:34.402 --> 00:21:36.929
I've spent time in the natural products,

579
00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:39.372
alternative medicine world.

580
00:21:39.372 --> 00:21:42.454
And in the astrological world.

581
00:21:42.454 --> 00:21:46.255
The reason I love being in the astrology world

582
00:21:46.255 --> 00:21:49.604
is the people who are involved in it are so damn smart.

583
00:21:49.604 --> 00:21:51.108
<v Voiceover>This has been my observations.</v>

584
00:21:51.108 --> 00:21:53.892
Well we have to remember kings and queens and--

585
00:21:53.892 --> 00:21:54.715
<v ->Popes.
<v Voiceover>and popes.</v>

586
00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:56.319
<v ->Let's talk about popes.
<v Voiceover>Popes and muses.</v>

587
00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:57.350
<v ->Until the 15th century</v>

588
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.785
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

589
00:21:57.785 --> 00:22:01.785
<v ->almost every pope either was an astrologer</v>

590
00:22:01.785 --> 00:22:03.268
or employed a staff of them.

591
00:22:03.268 --> 00:22:03.940
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

592
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.102
<v ->And, you know, all it takes is one trip to Europe</v>

593
00:22:07.102 --> 00:22:10.835
and going to the cathedral and seeing in the cathedrals

594
00:22:10.835 --> 00:22:15.224
the signs of the zodiac on the Sistine Chapel in all of the

595
00:22:15.224 --> 00:22:18.962
old cathedrals in Europe the connection between astrology

596
00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:21.789
and the church is absolutely intertwined and yet

597
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:24.185
we forget about that.

598
00:22:24.185 --> 00:22:25.268
<v Voiceover>Why did that get cut?</v>

599
00:22:25.268 --> 00:22:28.910
Why was that separate?

600
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.803
(children squealing)

601
00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:35.897
<v ->The connection between the church and astrology</v>

602
00:22:35.897 --> 00:22:39.918
is really interesting because politically it's

603
00:22:39.918 --> 00:22:41.859
a difficult position.

604
00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:46.179
To want to be in control, the church,

605
00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:49.176
and have people go to the edge of town and

606
00:22:49.176 --> 00:22:51.938
talk to the astrologer and find out what's going on.

607
00:22:51.938 --> 00:22:56.695
Either Jesus is the salvation or the astrologer

608
00:22:56.695 --> 00:22:57.815
has the information.

609
00:22:57.815 --> 00:22:58.839
Can't be both.

610
00:22:58.839 --> 00:23:01.532
And in some ways, you see,

611
00:23:01.532 --> 00:23:03.871
the fascinating thing is the church in none of its

612
00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:08.298
writing anywhere by any real church theologian

613
00:23:08.298 --> 00:23:10.804
has ever said astrology doesn't work.

614
00:23:10.804 --> 00:23:12.244
They just said don't do it.

615
00:23:12.244 --> 00:23:12.895
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

616
00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:16.340
<v ->And this is very important because the "don't do it"</v>

617
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.265
involves the sense of who's in control.

618
00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:21.143
Is it Jesus or is it the stars?

619
00:23:21.143 --> 00:23:25.238
Now, the odd thing here is I find it very peculiar

620
00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:27.158
that the Lord's prayer says it's done on Earth

621
00:23:27.158 --> 00:23:28.929
as it is in Heaven.

622
00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:30.315
And yet no one really believes that.

623
00:23:30.315 --> 00:23:31.414
(laughs)
<v Voiceover>Right. Right.</v>

624
00:23:31.414 --> 00:23:34.038
<v ->Because that's all astrology really says is that</v>

625
00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:35.563
it's done on Earth as it is in Heaven.

626
00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:36.075
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

627
00:23:36.075 --> 00:23:37.931
<v ->And so you have these people mumbling these words</v>

628
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:40.256
every time they get together in a group and pray.

629
00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:41.995
And yet, they same it the same breath

630
00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:43.296
but don't use relegy.
<v Voiceover>Don't look up.</v>

631
00:23:43.296 --> 00:23:43.860
Don't look up.

632
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.204
<v ->Don't look up and don't look in.</v>

633
00:23:45.204 --> 00:23:45.707
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

634
00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:47.742
<v ->Actually James Hillman points out that one of the</v>

635
00:23:47.742 --> 00:23:51.531
insidious things about the catholic, about the church

636
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:55.667
is that if Jesus banished Hades from the hell realms,

637
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:58.173
then what it really does is it robs each and every

638
00:23:58.173 --> 00:24:01.661
one of us of our hero's journey into the underworld,

639
00:24:01.661 --> 00:24:02.866
into our inner worlds,

640
00:24:02.866 --> 00:24:04.702
to do the work and come back with our own magic.

641
00:24:04.702 --> 00:24:05.384
We don't have to do
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

642
00:24:05.384 --> 00:24:07.101
<v ->the work 'cause he did it for us.</v>

643
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:07.444
<v Voiceover>Very</v>

644
00:24:07.444 --> 00:24:08.035
interesting.
<v Rick>It's an interesting</v>

645
00:24:08.035 --> 00:24:08.527
observation.
<v Voiceover>It is an</v>

646
00:24:08.527 --> 00:24:09.533
interesting observation.
<v Rick>Hillman has</v>

647
00:24:09.533 --> 00:24:10.631
many observations that

648
00:24:10.631 --> 00:24:11.354
are interesting.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

649
00:24:11.354 --> 00:24:13.370
<v ->But coming back to this whole thing of</v>

650
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.554
church and politics,

651
00:24:14.554 --> 00:24:17.865
or of the politics of church and astrology,

652
00:24:17.865 --> 00:24:22.129
is that another interesting observation is that astrology

653
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:26.130
is the only thing that I know of that modern science

654
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.010
and the church agree on.

655
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:33.191
And that is, astrology is a blight on mankind and

656
00:24:33.191 --> 00:24:38.191
the wart of astrology needs to be, you know, excised

657
00:24:38.418 --> 00:24:42.716
from the body of human thought and action

658
00:24:42.716 --> 00:24:45.063
for very different reason interestingly,

659
00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:46.365
but they both have a lot at stake.

660
00:24:46.365 --> 00:24:48.775
The church has this whole political thing at stake

661
00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:50.631
of, you know, who's in control.

662
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:54.396
Interesting, the Jews, the "Talmud"

663
00:24:54.396 --> 00:24:55.468
says that astrology works,

664
00:24:55.468 --> 00:24:56.534
but not for the Jews.

665
00:24:56.534 --> 00:24:58.070
(laughing)

666
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.604
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

667
00:24:58.604 --> 00:24:59.905
<v ->Oh yes, the short version of it.</v>

668
00:24:59.905 --> 00:25:00.505
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v Rick>But again,</v>

669
00:25:00.505 --> 00:25:02.110
<v ->it's like if you have</v>

670
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.595
some intention
<v Voiceover>Still taking</v>

671
00:25:02.595 --> 00:25:03.662
this power away.

672
00:25:03.662 --> 00:25:05.912
<v ->If you have some intention of a higher focus</v>

673
00:25:05.912 --> 00:25:07.128
then it's like it doesn't matter.

674
00:25:07.128 --> 00:25:11.264
Gravity, you know, doesn't impact you.

675
00:25:11.264 --> 00:25:12.711
But getting back to the science thing,

676
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:15.846
the problem with science and astrology is that

677
00:25:15.846 --> 00:25:18.982
you can't have a system based upon repeatability.

678
00:25:18.982 --> 00:25:21.627
Which is what the experimental method says that

679
00:25:21.627 --> 00:25:22.790
if you drop an object,

680
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.029
it has to accelerate at 32 feet per second, per second

681
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.752
all the time.

682
00:25:25.752 --> 00:25:26.542
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

683
00:25:26.542 --> 00:25:29.423
<v ->And yet, when the Moon is full,</v>

684
00:25:29.423 --> 00:25:31.888
it functions differently then when the Moon is new,

685
00:25:31.888 --> 00:25:33.787
then we have a problem in science.

686
00:25:33.787 --> 00:25:37.594
And it turns out that a student of Rudolf Steiner's,

687
00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:41.754
a chemist named Lili Kolisko in the '20s or '30s

688
00:25:41.754 --> 00:25:45.605
did a series of experiments where she took metal salts.

689
00:25:45.605 --> 00:25:50.298
Now, the ancients had a system where each

690
00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:51.738
of the seven planets,

691
00:25:51.738 --> 00:25:53.433
and when I use the word "planets" I use it in the

692
00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:56.477
Greek sense of Sun and Moon being a wanderer just like

693
00:25:56.477 --> 00:25:57.812
the other known planets.

694
00:25:57.812 --> 00:25:58.062
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

695
00:25:58.062 --> 00:25:59.491
<v ->But the seven visible planets,</v>

696
00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:02.109
Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,

697
00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:06.847
each had an association with one of what

698
00:26:06.847 --> 00:26:09.325
the ancients called the seven primary metals.

699
00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

700
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.914
<v ->So, the Sun was associated with gold.</v>

701
00:26:12.914 --> 00:26:14.568
Silver with the Moon.

702
00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:16.372
Mercury with Mercury.

703
00:26:16.372 --> 00:26:19.382
Copper with Venus.

704
00:26:19.382 --> 00:26:20.621
Iron with Mars.

705
00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:21.527
Tin with Jupiter.

706
00:26:21.527 --> 00:26:22.498
Lead with Saturn.

707
00:26:22.498 --> 00:26:25.878
Okay. (thump) Fine.

708
00:26:25.878 --> 00:26:28.641
The fascinating thing is that these metals can all be

709
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:30.870
made into chemical compounds called salts,

710
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.171
like copper sulfate,

711
00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:37.171
that bright green blue crystal or gold sulfite.

712
00:26:38.411 --> 00:26:43.411
Or iron sulfate or so on.

713
00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:46.634
Mercury chloride, et cetera.

714
00:26:46.634 --> 00:26:48.672
And so, these have become liquids

715
00:26:48.672 --> 00:26:51.466
because you can dissolve a salt in water.

716
00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:54.741
If you take a piece of filter paper and put it into

717
00:26:54.741 --> 00:26:57.034
these salt solutions,

718
00:26:57.034 --> 00:27:01.270
the liquid capillary action comes up the filter paper

719
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.620
and then you take it out and you let it dry.

720
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.482
Every salt compound has a distinguishable color,

721
00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:11.127
crystalline pattern that can be used to identify

722
00:27:11.127 --> 00:27:12.887
what the salt is in the laboratory.

723
00:27:12.887 --> 00:27:13.335
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

724
00:27:13.335 --> 00:27:16.762
<v ->It's one of those techniques that laboratory scientists</v>

725
00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:19.087
will use to figure out what's in a compound.

726
00:27:19.087 --> 00:27:20.777
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

727
00:27:20.777 --> 00:27:23.939
<v ->The problem that Lili Kolisko discovered,</v>

728
00:27:23.939 --> 00:27:27.558
and these experiments were redone by an associate of mine

729
00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:32.558
for his PhD thesis and the history of science at Cambridge

730
00:27:33.124 --> 00:27:36.258
a few years ago,

731
00:27:36.258 --> 00:27:38.576
incidentally this associates name is Nick Kollerstrom,

732
00:27:38.576 --> 00:27:40.837
K-O-L-L-E-R-S-T-R-O-M

733
00:27:40.837 --> 00:27:42.223
and you can Google this.

734
00:27:42.223 --> 00:27:44.723
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

735
00:27:44.723 --> 00:27:47.880
<v ->What Lili Kolisko discovered is that for a few hours</v>

736
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.123
every month when the planet associated with that

737
00:27:52.123 --> 00:27:57.123
particular metal was aligned in conjunction with the Moon,

738
00:27:59.856 --> 00:28:02.437
the cell salts or the salts would not crystallize.

739
00:28:02.437 --> 00:28:05.285
They would just remain grey sludge.

740
00:28:05.285 --> 00:28:06.245
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

741
00:28:06.245 --> 00:28:08.630
<v ->Now, so that means that you can take copper sulfate</v>

742
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.301
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

743
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:13.802
<v ->And for 28 days a month it will crystallize just as</v>

744
00:28:13.802 --> 00:28:14.869
it's supposed to,

745
00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:18.075
but for about for fours before and six hours after

746
00:28:18.075 --> 00:28:20.677
the alignment of Venus and the Moon,

747
00:28:20.677 --> 00:28:21.765
which happens once a month,

748
00:28:21.765 --> 00:28:23.184
because the Moon goes around once a month,

749
00:28:23.184 --> 00:28:24.293
Venus is moving
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

750
00:28:24.293 --> 00:28:25.274
<v ->at it's own rate.</v>

751
00:28:25.274 --> 00:28:30.274
And so once a month Venus or the Moon lines up with Venus

752
00:28:30.456 --> 00:28:32.463
and the same is true with each of the different planets

753
00:28:32.463 --> 00:28:33.924
and each of those different salts.

754
00:28:33.924 --> 00:28:35.962
Now, this is huge because here's a

755
00:28:35.962 --> 00:28:38.292
physical manifestation
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

756
00:28:38.292 --> 00:28:41.635
<v ->of how the movement of these planets actually change.</v>

757
00:28:41.635 --> 00:28:45.034
Perhaps blood chemistry which we know relates to emotion.

758
00:28:45.034 --> 00:28:47.818
I mean it's either all connected or it isn't.

759
00:28:47.818 --> 00:28:49.908
This is a clue that it may be all connected.

760
00:28:49.908 --> 00:28:54.908
Now, the problem still becomes that if time is a variable

761
00:28:55.857 --> 00:28:58.993
that a scientist needs to take into account,

762
00:28:58.993 --> 00:29:01.470
then the experimental model is in trouble.

763
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:05.197
And everything in science is based upon on repeatability.

764
00:29:05.197 --> 00:29:06.404
Like a neurotic.

765
00:29:06.404 --> 00:29:10.394
Doing it again and again and again and again and again.

766
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.428
And a neurosis is based upon an untruth.

767
00:29:13.428 --> 00:29:18.004
And therapy basically goes through the neurotic's past,

768
00:29:18.004 --> 00:29:19.742
unwinds the story,

769
00:29:19.742 --> 00:29:22.718
so they can be freed from their compulsive habits

770
00:29:22.718 --> 00:29:24.265
or patterning.

771
00:29:24.265 --> 00:29:28.584
It's my suggestion that a lot of what's happening and

772
00:29:28.584 --> 00:29:32.115
what astrology and other things have to offer to science

773
00:29:32.115 --> 00:29:36.067
is perhaps a retelling of the story because we,

774
00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:38.720
in the age in enlightenment or as Rob Handon,

775
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.224
an associate of mine says,

776
00:29:40.224 --> 00:29:41.611
the age of endarkenment,

777
00:29:41.611 --> 00:29:42.304
(chuckle)

778
00:29:42.304 --> 00:29:44.684
what happened is that we forgot that

779
00:29:44.684 --> 00:29:46.410
we were connected with everything.

780
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:50.239
And so, we have a basic untruth sitting behind the

781
00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:53.832
entire experimental scientific model.

782
00:29:53.832 --> 00:29:57.344
John Anthony West who was an Egyptologist and

783
00:29:57.344 --> 00:29:59.688
wrote a book called, "The Case for Astrology,"

784
00:29:59.688 --> 00:30:02.079
he calls science the church of progress.

785
00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:04.580
<v Voiceover>Yes and he's a seriously intelligent man.</v>

786
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.477
I've interviewed him a
<v Rick>John's a good guy.</v>

787
00:30:05.477 --> 00:30:08.610
<v Voiceover>couple of times</v>
<v Rick>I know John.</v>

788
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.866
But he talks about how they,

789
00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:12.916
that these priests of the church of progress

790
00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:14.004
wear their robes,

791
00:30:14.004 --> 00:30:14.889
have their jarg on,

792
00:30:14.889 --> 00:30:16.350
have their belief system,

793
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.962
and part of their belief system is what Deepak Chopra calls

794
00:30:19.962 --> 00:30:21.782
the superstition of materialism.

795
00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:22.507
(laughing)

796
00:30:22.507 --> 00:30:23.296
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>
<v Rick>I love that.</v>

797
00:30:23.296 --> 00:30:24.111
<v Voiceover>I do too.</v>
<v Rick>Just the superstition</v>

798
00:30:24.111 --> 00:30:25.174
of materialism.
(laughing)

799
00:30:25.174 --> 00:30:25.424
<v Voiceover>Oh, yes.</v>

800
00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:26.416
<v ->It's a superstition.</v>

801
00:30:26.416 --> 00:30:27.426
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

802
00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:28.807
<v ->Somewhere along the line,</v>

803
00:30:28.807 --> 00:30:31.452
someone believed that what we see is actually

804
00:30:31.452 --> 00:30:32.593
what we get.

805
00:30:32.593 --> 00:30:33.148
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

806
00:30:33.148 --> 00:30:33.419
<v ->You know.</v>

807
00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:36.064
And it's just not quite that way.

808
00:30:36.064 --> 00:30:36.533
<v Voiceover>There's more to</v>

809
00:30:36.533 --> 00:30:37.074
that story.
<v Rick>I don't remember</v>

810
00:30:37.074 --> 00:30:37.506
what your question,

811
00:30:37.506 --> 00:30:38.240
but did we answer it?
<v Voiceover>And you know</v>

812
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.252
what?
(laughing)

813
00:30:39.252 --> 00:30:42.325
At this point, oh I was asking about church and astrology,

814
00:30:42.325 --> 00:30:45.344
but I think you answered it and then we got some bonuses

815
00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:45.918
in there too.

816
00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:47.177
I just have a,

817
00:30:47.177 --> 00:30:49.449
I have one other question that I've wondered about

818
00:30:49.449 --> 00:30:51.027
in my lifetime about this whole notion,

819
00:30:51.027 --> 00:30:53.075
back to the original question of

820
00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:54.163
freewill versus fate.
<v Rick>Fate.</v>

821
00:30:54.163 --> 00:30:55.326
Rate versus freewill.
<v Voiceover>And that is,</v>

822
00:30:55.326 --> 00:30:56.965
where does the soul, the intention of the soul,

823
00:30:56.965 --> 00:30:57.946
come into it?

824
00:30:57.946 --> 00:31:02.170
If the soul is choosing to incarnate and has options

825
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.810
<v ->Mm Hmm.</v>

826
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.171
<v Voiceover>as to the astrological influences,</v>

827
00:31:06.171 --> 00:31:08.779
perhaps even the Trivates incarnating into if

828
00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:09.395
they do have that

829
00:31:09.395 --> 00:31:10.972
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Kind of choice.</v>

830
00:31:10.972 --> 00:31:12.966
Can't that be considered part of the freewill?

831
00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:15.377
Is the very choice of those aspects in your birth

832
00:31:15.377 --> 00:31:16.198
to begin with?
<v ->Yes.</v>

833
00:31:16.198 --> 00:31:17.789
Or part of the fate.

834
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:19.541
<v Voiceover>Or part of the fate. (laughs)</v>

835
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:22.494
<v ->Depending upon where you are in the process.</v>

836
00:31:22.494 --> 00:31:22.994
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

837
00:31:22.994 --> 00:31:25.789
<v ->You see karma basically,</v>

838
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:28.040
which is Newton's third law which basically says

839
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.994
an object, well no, it basically says that

840
00:31:30.994 --> 00:31:33.170
for every action there's an opposite and equal

841
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.237
reaction.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

842
00:31:34.237 --> 00:31:39.164
<v ->So, we are the result of all of our past actions.</v>

843
00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:42.855
And yet, at every given moment in time

844
00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:44.572
we can't change everything,

845
00:31:44.572 --> 00:31:46.428
but we can intercede in little ways.

846
00:31:46.428 --> 00:31:48.038
This is the magic of yoga.

847
00:31:48.038 --> 00:31:52.326
I mean what it's doing is it develops what starts off

848
00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:55.274
as a very little, you know,

849
00:31:55.274 --> 00:31:56.555
(inhales)

850
00:31:56.555 --> 00:31:57.920
just be aware of this.

851
00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.157
Just sit like,

852
00:32:00.157 --> 00:32:01.955
anything like that,

853
00:32:01.955 --> 00:32:06.428
what it does is it brings in a different habit.

854
00:32:06.428 --> 00:32:07.132
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

855
00:32:07.132 --> 00:32:10.331
<v ->And by doing that, we're actually breaking the cycles.</v>

856
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:12.166
I mean there are many ways to break cycles.

857
00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:14.555
Whether it's yoga, whether it's an exercise program,

858
00:32:14.555 --> 00:32:15.931
whether it's changing your diet,

859
00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:17.691
whether it's psychotherapy, whether--

860
00:32:17.691 --> 00:32:20.645
I mean there's all different ways of different practices

861
00:32:20.645 --> 00:32:22.107
to break patterns.

862
00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:26.650
So, I used to, when I taught astrology for beginners,

863
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.741
in my second class I used to have what I call the

864
00:32:28.741 --> 00:32:30.650
fate versus freewill discussion.

865
00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.442
And I'd go around the room and ask everyone,

866
00:32:32.442 --> 00:32:35.173
"So, what do you think? Fate or freewill?"

867
00:32:35.173 --> 00:32:38.640
And during one particular class and this,

868
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.866
I mean I can see it as if it were yesterday.

869
00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:43.607
It was probably 20 some odd years ago.

870
00:32:43.607 --> 00:32:45.185
There were two women sitting next to each other

871
00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:46.572
who didn't know each other.

872
00:32:46.572 --> 00:32:51.572
And the first woman was probably in her late 50s then,

873
00:32:51.827 --> 00:32:53.523
early 60s.

874
00:32:53.523 --> 00:32:54.813
She owned a home in Seattle.

875
00:32:54.813 --> 00:32:56.852
She owned a home in Sedona.

876
00:32:56.852 --> 00:33:01.852
And she was a post married single woman who

877
00:33:05.752 --> 00:33:09.095
was wealthy enough to go to any consciousness workshop

878
00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:11.026
anywhere on the planet as she chose,

879
00:33:11.026 --> 00:33:12.626
and she did.

880
00:33:12.626 --> 00:33:14.908
And she'd been Course of Miracles,

881
00:33:14.908 --> 00:33:19.908
she'd been to Omega and Esalen and Hollyhock, you know.

882
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.318
<v Voiceover>That she'd done the circuit.</v>

883
00:33:21.318 --> 00:33:22.693
<v ->She'd done the circuit.</v>

884
00:33:22.693 --> 00:33:26.725
And she said, "It's obviously freewill."

885
00:33:26.725 --> 00:33:28.507
We co-create our reality.

886
00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:30.313
Our reality is what we make it.

887
00:33:30.313 --> 00:33:32.862
We have choices, we exercise these choices.

888
00:33:32.862 --> 00:33:37.534
And so I definitely would vote on the freewill side.

889
00:33:37.534 --> 00:33:42.534
The woman sitting to her left said, "I disagree.

890
00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:46.163
"I personally think it's like all fate.

891
00:33:46.163 --> 00:33:49.746
"I'm the mother of two teenage hemophiliac kids

892
00:33:49.746 --> 00:33:53.063
"who are HIV positive because of blood transfusions.

893
00:33:53.063 --> 00:33:58.042
"And this is not something that I chose or would've chose

894
00:33:58.042 --> 00:34:01.658
"consciously and I think this idea of co-creating

895
00:34:01.658 --> 00:34:03.823
"our universe is a bunch of hogwash.

896
00:34:03.823 --> 00:34:07.749
"And as much as I live a pretty good life and clean life and

897
00:34:07.749 --> 00:34:09.871
"I make the best of what I have.

898
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:13.671
"This is a tough existence that I didn't ask for

899
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:16.220
"and everyday if there's a way I could change it, I would.

900
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.481
"I don't get that option that you have of co-creating

901
00:34:18.481 --> 00:34:19.388
"my universe."

902
00:34:19.388 --> 00:34:21.756
And in that moment it dawned on me it was very simple.

903
00:34:21.756 --> 00:34:23.675
The better your life is the more the ego would like

904
00:34:23.675 --> 00:34:26.111
to take credit for it and think that's freewill.

905
00:34:26.111 --> 00:34:26.783
(laughing)

906
00:34:26.783 --> 00:34:29.802
The less good, that's not correct English.

907
00:34:29.802 --> 00:34:32.820
The worst off you are, in whatever way you judge it,

908
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.772
the more you think that you're not in control

909
00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:35.935
and something else is.

910
00:34:35.935 --> 00:34:39.995
And that may be an over simplification.

911
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:41.896
But again I think that it comes back to that.

912
00:34:41.896 --> 00:34:44.957
It's a spectrum and I think that some people

913
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:49.957
moving through life seem to have consistently more

914
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:54.802
apparent freewill than other people who seem not

915
00:34:54.802 --> 00:34:56.946
to be able to make anything happen.

916
00:34:56.946 --> 00:34:58.076
And, hold on one second,

917
00:34:58.076 --> 00:34:59.687
and by the same token,

918
00:34:59.687 --> 00:35:04.583
there are times in our life when anything

919
00:35:04.583 --> 00:35:05.927
we think can happen.

920
00:35:05.927 --> 00:35:07.463
And there are other times in our life where

921
00:35:07.463 --> 00:35:10.268
it doesn't matter what we're doing, it's not happening.

922
00:35:10.268 --> 00:35:11.985
And so, it's a kind of a slippery issue.

923
00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:14.523
An astrology can look at some of that but

924
00:35:14.523 --> 00:35:16.401
it's not a quick and easy answer.

925
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:17.702
<v Voiceover>Could that have anything to do with</v>

926
00:35:17.702 --> 00:35:20.576
the density of karma per chance?

927
00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:21.479
<v ->Sure.
<v Voiceover>That's</v>

928
00:35:21.479 --> 00:35:22.369
a possibility.
<v Rick>The density</v>

929
00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:23.688
of karma.

930
00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:25.186
You know, or who knows why.

931
00:35:25.186 --> 00:35:26.186
<v Voiceover>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

932
00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:26.852
The density of karma.

933
00:35:26.852 --> 00:35:27.382
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

934
00:35:27.382 --> 00:35:28.718
<v ->It could have to do with the, you know,</v>

935
00:35:28.718 --> 00:35:29.923
astrology of the moment.

936
00:35:29.923 --> 00:35:30.520
It could have

937
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.523
to do
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

938
00:35:31.523 --> 00:35:32.888
<v ->with the tribe and, you know,</v>

939
00:35:32.888 --> 00:35:34.819
and the place that we've incarnated.

940
00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:37.304
This whole thing about the choice of incarnation,

941
00:35:37.304 --> 00:35:38.957
I'm sure that some people, you know,

942
00:35:38.957 --> 00:35:41.108
read the fine print and signed on the dotted line

943
00:35:41.108 --> 00:35:42.546
and said, "Here I go."

944
00:35:42.546 --> 00:35:45.330
And yet, there are days when I think I was just peering

945
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.279
over the edge and went,

946
00:35:46.279 --> 00:35:47.516
aaaghhhh!
(laughing)

947
00:35:47.516 --> 00:35:49.237
Oh shit.
(laughing)

948
00:35:49.237 --> 00:35:49.923
You know.

949
00:35:49.923 --> 00:35:51.693
I don't know that it's always conscious.

950
00:35:51.693 --> 00:35:55.245
I mean if you study the Tibetan "Book of the Dead"

951
00:35:55.245 --> 00:35:56.866
and the Tibetans who I think probably have a better

952
00:35:56.866 --> 00:35:59.842
sense of the of space between death and rebirth

953
00:35:59.842 --> 00:36:02.931
and many of the other philosophies.

954
00:36:02.931 --> 00:36:04.914
It's not always real conscious,

955
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.366
what happens in the bardo states and the states

956
00:36:07.366 --> 00:36:07.739
after death
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

957
00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:09.040
<v ->and before birth.</v>

958
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.184
And yeah, sometimes I think we choose,

959
00:36:11.184 --> 00:36:14.149
but sometimes I think we can slip there as much as

960
00:36:14.149 --> 00:36:17.168
we can slip here.

961
00:36:17.168 --> 00:36:20.421
The other thing is that even if we chose something,

962
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:22.117
even if we read the fine print,

963
00:36:22.117 --> 00:36:24.463
we sign on the doted line and we're in for exactly

964
00:36:24.463 --> 00:36:26.106
what we signed up for.

965
00:36:26.106 --> 00:36:28.452
There's still what I call the karmic zap factor.

966
00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:32.846
(chuckles) And that is, strange things can happen.

967
00:36:32.846 --> 00:36:34.109
And at any given moment,

968
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:37.554
this is a concept of Dzogchen which is a branch of Buddhism

969
00:36:37.554 --> 00:36:40.849
which basically says liberation and enlightenment

970
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:43.932
and ultimate change is available at any given moment

971
00:36:43.932 --> 00:36:45.649
all the time to anyone.

972
00:36:45.649 --> 00:36:47.253
Now, of course, the great Dzogchen masters have

973
00:36:47.253 --> 00:36:48.289
studied for lifetimes.

974
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.239
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

975
00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:50.706
<v ->But the fact is that it's--</v>

976
00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:51.954
<v Voiceover>Theoretically that is true though.</v>

977
00:36:51.954 --> 00:36:53.580
<v ->All there is is now.</v>

978
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.084
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v Rick>There is nothing</v>

979
00:36:54.084 --> 00:36:55.428
else than now.

980
00:36:55.428 --> 00:36:58.500
Granted as physical bodies we have weight from the past,

981
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.443
as egos we have anticipation of the future,

982
00:37:01.443 --> 00:37:03.833
but it's all right now.

983
00:37:03.833 --> 00:37:05.945
And so, at any given moment we are free with these

984
00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:09.219
big changes that we have going on all over on planet Earth.

985
00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:12.003
And you don't need to be a cosmologist or an astrologer

986
00:37:12.003 --> 00:37:15.256
or even paying attention to know that there's big stuff

987
00:37:15.256 --> 00:37:16.600
going on these days.

988
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.224
The fact is that we can doom and gloom it and

989
00:37:19.224 --> 00:37:20.344
it may all go down.

990
00:37:20.344 --> 00:37:21.666
Don't know. It may.

991
00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:24.919
But, we also have the potential of turning

992
00:37:24.919 --> 00:37:27.660
the ship around on a molecule.

993
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.143
That fast.

994
00:37:29.143 --> 00:37:31.042
And that's what happens when the lightning

995
00:37:31.042 --> 00:37:32.482
of awareness hits.

996
00:37:32.482 --> 00:37:34.446
That's some of the work,

997
00:37:34.446 --> 00:37:37.168
some of the reason why I'm doing what I'm doing,

998
00:37:37.168 --> 00:37:38.832
what you're doing what you're doing

999
00:37:38.832 --> 00:37:43.205
is because the new age, or the apocalypse does not

1000
00:37:43.205 --> 00:37:45.285
happen at one moment in time.

1001
00:37:45.285 --> 00:37:48.496
It happens to those people who are either ready

1002
00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:52.048
or standing in the right point or whatever it is.

1003
00:37:52.048 --> 00:37:53.509
When you get struck by the lightning,

1004
00:37:53.509 --> 00:37:55.087
that's it right then and there.

1005
00:37:55.087 --> 00:37:56.858
And yet, the lightning's getting bigger.

1006
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:58.618
More and more people are getting struck.

1007
00:37:58.618 --> 00:38:03.618
And as awareness changes, you know, the phenomenon spreads

1008
00:38:04.143 --> 00:38:07.128
and anything, it's like being in double jeopardy,

1009
00:38:07.128 --> 00:38:09.137
you know, where scores can change and anything can happen.

1010
00:38:09.137 --> 00:38:10.001
<v Voiceover>Anything can happen.</v>

1011
00:38:10.001 --> 00:38:11.228
<v ->Anyone can win.</v>

1012
00:38:11.228 --> 00:38:13.553
<v Voiceover>And, we do have the right to choose how</v>

1013
00:38:13.553 --> 00:38:15.387
we're going to act and react to all of it.

1014
00:38:15.387 --> 00:38:16.966
<v ->We have the illusion of right to choose.</v>

1015
00:38:16.966 --> 00:38:17.851
<v Voiceover>Yes. Yes.</v>
(laughing)

1016
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:19.099
<v Rick>No. And I'm not</v>
<v Voiceover>There's no right</v>

1017
00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:19.936
<v Rick>taking anyway.</v>
<v Voiceover>to choose how</v>

1018
00:38:19.936 --> 00:38:20.616
we want to respond.

1019
00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:21.458
We can either--

1020
00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:22.269
<v ->Yeah, we--</v>

1021
00:38:22.269 --> 00:38:23.943
<v Voiceover>We can either throw our hands up and despair</v>

1022
00:38:23.943 --> 00:38:24.797
or we can--

1023
00:38:24.797 --> 00:38:29.797
<v ->I once saw this very wonderful Rinpoche who's actually</v>

1024
00:38:31.034 --> 00:38:33.661
British born but spent 20 years in the caves and in

1025
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:35.240
the Hills of Bhutan.

1026
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.376
And his name was Nangpa Choekyi Rinpoche.

1027
00:38:38.376 --> 00:38:40.189
And a Nangpa is a title.

1028
00:38:40.189 --> 00:38:45.189
A Nangpa is an awareness master.

1029
00:38:46.485 --> 00:38:50.403
A word awareness I think is, word awareness master.

1030
00:38:50.403 --> 00:38:51.843
He called himself mantra man.

1031
00:38:51.843 --> 00:38:52.611
(laughing)

1032
00:38:52.611 --> 00:38:53.123
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1033
00:38:53.123 --> 00:38:54.115
<v ->And this guy was brilliant.</v>

1034
00:38:54.115 --> 00:38:55.480
He's still around.

1035
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.512
I haven't seen him for probably 15 years.

1036
00:38:57.512 --> 00:38:59.090
<v Voiceover>So, what says mantra man?</v>

1037
00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.373
<v ->Well, mantra man, when someone asked,</v>

1038
00:39:01.373 --> 00:39:03.346
"So what is it, fate or freewill?,"

1039
00:39:03.346 --> 00:39:06.994
said imagine you're walking down the street

1040
00:39:06.994 --> 00:39:09.127
and it's a bright sunny day and it's beautiful out

1041
00:39:09.127 --> 00:39:11.143
and you're whistling and you're having a good day.

1042
00:39:11.143 --> 00:39:13.670
And you look up to your left and on the third story

1043
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.764
there's a couple of bricklayers doing some repair work,

1044
00:39:16.764 --> 00:39:18.897
and as you walk by, you put your left foot out.

1045
00:39:18.897 --> 00:39:21.791
And just as you do, these guys knock a brick over

1046
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:23.218
(slam)
and it falls on your foot

1047
00:39:23.218 --> 00:39:25.304
and it breaks your foot.

1048
00:39:25.304 --> 00:39:27.451
And you look up and they're totally unconscious.

1049
00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:28.774
They don't even realize what they've done.

1050
00:39:28.774 --> 00:39:30.235
They're laughing, having a good time.

1051
00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:31.931
Your foot is hurting.

1052
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:35.675
You are in deep pain and you realize that your foot

1053
00:39:35.675 --> 00:39:38.011
is busted and you yell up at them and say,

1054
00:39:38.011 --> 00:39:39.525
"Hey, you guys. Be careful."

1055
00:39:39.525 --> 00:39:40.635
They don't hear you.

1056
00:39:40.635 --> 00:39:43.450
And so, the anger begins to well up and you're yelling

1057
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.978
at them 'cause you're in pain and they don't know it.

1058
00:39:45.978 --> 00:39:49.335
And you're at such a steep angle that they can't see you.

1059
00:39:49.335 --> 00:39:51.782
So, you step back 10 steps to get a better view.

1060
00:39:51.782 --> 00:39:53.785
A truck comes down the street, runs you over

1061
00:39:53.785 --> 00:39:54.448
and kills you.
(chuckle)

1062
00:39:54.448 --> 00:39:56.780
Fate or freewill?

1063
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.801
This is what he said.

1064
00:39:58.801 --> 00:40:00.699
And he said, "To me it's very plain.

1065
00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:03.184
"The brick landing on your foot was an act of fate,

1066
00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:05.232
"your death was an act of freewill."

1067
00:40:05.232 --> 00:40:06.480
And it's exactly what you

1068
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.131
just said
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1069
00:40:07.131 --> 00:40:12.131
<v ->and that is we can't control which way the wind blows.</v>

1070
00:40:12.858 --> 00:40:15.388
And we can't always control the way react,

1071
00:40:15.388 --> 00:40:19.591
but we can learn practices to help us change

1072
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:23.655
the response time and the reaction.

1073
00:40:23.655 --> 00:40:27.889
So, there in lies the key to making the small adjustments

1074
00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:31.718
at first that become more significant over time as

1075
00:40:31.718 --> 00:40:34.577
awareness and practice become married,

1076
00:40:34.577 --> 00:40:35.985
which is really what yoga is,

1077
00:40:35.985 --> 00:40:37.222
a combination of, you know,

1078
00:40:37.222 --> 00:40:39.984
yoga comes from the word "yoke" of an oxen

1079
00:40:39.984 --> 00:40:43.024
and has had a harness that's uncontrollable energy

1080
00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:48.024
by a practice of containing it enough to move it in

1081
00:40:48.037 --> 00:40:50.224
a direction that makes sense rather than having

1082
00:40:50.224 --> 00:40:52.089
the bull charge you.

1083
00:40:52.089 --> 00:40:54.789
<v Voiceover>On that note, thank you so much for your time.</v>

1084
00:40:54.789 --> 00:40:58.575
Very entertaining as well as enlightening.

1085
00:40:58.575 --> 00:41:00.804
I loved your presentation today and you have a

1086
00:41:00.804 --> 00:41:03.236
new book coming out for 2009 that people can check out.

1087
00:41:03.236 --> 00:41:05.721
Also, they can go to any of these websites and

1088
00:41:05.721 --> 00:41:06.905
look at the dailies.

1089
00:41:06.905 --> 00:41:08.975
And, you're available if someone wants to

1090
00:41:08.975 --> 00:41:09.684
chat with you too.

1091
00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:10.516

website info up there.
