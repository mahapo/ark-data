00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:02.751
There's no arguing that Nassim Haramein

2
00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:04.059
is an original thinker.

3
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.627
Still, he shocked himself

4
00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:07.555
and some of the world of classical physics

5
00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:09.460
when he recently won a coveted award

6
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.886
at an international physics conference in Belgium.

7
00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:13.016
The reason?

8
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.849
His work is way outside the box.

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.640
In fact he dares to say

10
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.394
that the clues for both his work

11
00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:20.642
and the future technologies on earth

12
00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:22.393
were left behind by the ancients,

13
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:24.873
i.e., E.T.'s, star-people, gods,

14
00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:26.054
as they were known.

15
00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:27.913
Nassim says these clues show us

16
00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:30.448
that unlimited energy is everywhere

17
00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:32.650
and we must only learn to tap into it.

18
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.218 line:15% 
(light bell music)

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.484
<v Hostess>Last time we spoke,</v>

20
00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:44.283
the first part of the conversation

21
00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:47.308
was a wonderful journey through the process

22
00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:48.734
of creation in consciousness

23
00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.007
and where we're headed

24
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:51.875
to eliminate duality.

25
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.337
Now, one of the areas on the planet,

26
00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:54.439
in a very concrete way,

27
00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:55.649
where we seem to be

28
00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.441
creating a lot of duality is,

29
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:58.810
"us against them" and a lot of it

30
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.680
has to do with resources and technologies.

31
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.927
<v ->Right.</v>

32
00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:04.582
<v Hostess>A lot of what you're doing right now</v>

33
00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:07.488
is really working toward application

34
00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:09.127
of technologies.

35
00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:09.854
And I don't know where

36
00:01:09.854 --> 00:01:10.905
we should start with on this.

37
00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.123
Should we start in Egypt?

38
00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:14.134
Or, should we start now and go back?

39
00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:15.751
Or, back then and come forward?

40
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.359
<v ->Yeah, we could start all the way back in Lemuria,</v>

41
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.959
you know?

42
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:19.817
<v Hostess>Let's start there.</v>

43
00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:21.299
Let's start in the ancient times of

44
00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.095
the technology as we've begun to understand,

45
00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.205
reveal, uncover and move forward

46
00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:27.762
into what's required...

47
00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:29.854
I don't even know the right question from here.

48
00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:31.078
Let's just begin.

49
00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:33.287
<v ->Well, it's interesting that</v>

50
00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:36.263
much of the research I had done

51
00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.267
in the earlier time was actually

52
00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:40.936
on ancient civilization because

53
00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:44.878
as I was elaborating in my head

54
00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:47.692
by observing nature and by studying physics,

55
00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:50.394
new concepts of physics, I kept on finding

56
00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:52.763
that they seem to link to ancient

57
00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:56.367
texts and monuments and concepts

58
00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:57.707
of geometry and so on,

59
00:01:57.707 --> 00:02:00.307
that you find in ancient times.

60
00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:02.373
You know, it seemed like there was

61
00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:03.926
a great mystery there and that

62
00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:08.095
there was a great message to be discovered.

63
00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:11.379
And, I was not the only one who felt that way in physics.

64
00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.369
Actually, one of our most famous physicists,

65
00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.353
Isaac Newton,

66
00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:19.246
spent most of his early time,

67
00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:21.028
some 20 years,

68
00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:22.914
studying ancient texts,

69
00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:25.700
ancient, mostly qabbalistic texts.

70
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.369
He learned ancient hebrew

71
00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.097
so he could decode them himself,

72
00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:34.163
built replicas of the Temple of Solomon and so on.

73
00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:37.921
Unknowingly, I took a very similar path.

74
00:02:38.293 --> 00:02:40.327
Newton was clear, by the way.

75
00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:44.231
He wrote all, or most of his physics

76
00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:46.501
based on the knowledge he learned

77
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.601
from studying ancient texts.

78
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.622
Not from apples falling on his head.

79
00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:51.641
<v Host>Mhmm.</v>

80
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:57.095
Similarly, when I was younger,

81
00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.743
I was studying a lot

82
00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:01.023
of ancient texts because

83
00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:03.051
I felt like there was a deep meaning there

84
00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:06.286
that hadn't been quite understood.

85
00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:09.879
Looking at these ancient knowledge

86
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.027
sets with the eye of physics.

87
00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:17.045
It started to come alive.

88
00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:19.916
It started to give a whole different picture

89
00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:21.793
then what had been interpreted

90
00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:26.241
by the archeology community at large.

91
00:03:26.657 --> 00:03:29.263
There's lots of evidence.

92
00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:31.746
Lots of evidence that there is...

93
00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.299
there was a very advanced civilization,

94
00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.389
prior to our written history,

95
00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:39.360
that was on our planet,

96
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.406
seemed to be prior to

97
00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:42.900
a large cataclysm

98
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.529
that moved a lot of things

99
00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.243
and changed a lot of things

100
00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:47.557
on our planet.

101
00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:50.174
There's remnants

102
00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:51.703
of that knowledge

103
00:03:51.703 --> 00:03:53.501
in many different cultures.

104
00:03:53.718 --> 00:03:57.221
Most of them call this knowledge set

105
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.373
and the people that brought it to them

106
00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.374
the Sun gods.

107
00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:04.379
It's found in the Mayan,

108
00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.916
the Incan tradition, the Chinese,

109
00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:11.916
the Japanese, the Egyptian tradition,

110
00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:16.732
even in ancient, um...

111
00:04:18.088 --> 00:04:19.216
<v Hostsess>Sumerian?</v>

112
00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:21.274
<v ->Sumerian tradition.</v>

113
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.514
The vast new tradition

114
00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:24.663
and all this...

115
00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:28.120
all these very ancient texts,

116
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.071
some of them very, very old,

117
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.373
talk about these sun gods,

118
00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:33.464
that came,

119
00:04:33.464 --> 00:04:37.450
that bestowed knowledge onto

120
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.680
the human beings at the time.

121
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.409
Taught them how to build enormous

122
00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:47.121
beautiful monuments and taught them

123
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.590
how to write, read,

124
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.074
how to behave with each other.

125
00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:53.077
To stop killing each other.

126
00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:55.409
They seem to be very pacifist,

127
00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.044
they seem to be vegetarian

128
00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:57.865
and so on.

129
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.024
And so,

130
00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:03.971
after reading all this stuff

131
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.176
and studying all this stuff,

132
00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:09.510
from all sorts of different cultures

133
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.478
around the world.

134
00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:11.680
It becomes compelling,

135
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.069
that this is not some imagination

136
00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.412
in a group of people isolated somewhere.

137
00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:20.417
That it's global and

138
00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.889
that it's relating

139
00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.212
a real experience,

140
00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:27.320
a direct experience with an advanced civilization.

141
00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.029
That might have found our planet

142
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.102
a very long time ago.

143
00:05:31.466 --> 00:05:32.533
If you were,

144
00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:36.758
an advanced civilization in our universe

145
00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:39.460
that's able to move across the galaxy,

146
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.813
or even from one galaxy to the other,

147
00:05:41.813 --> 00:05:44.321
or even from one universe to the other,

148
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:46.047
and you've found a planet that was

149
00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:48.912
very low in their evolution....

150
00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:50.100
It's not like you could just

151
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.702
go down there and start to

152
00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:53.440
teach them advanced physics and

153
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.759
teach them advanced mechanics

154
00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.179
and technology and all this.

155
00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:00.140
You'd have to, you know...

156
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.443
<v Hostess>We're trying to sharpen knives...</v>

157
00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:02.263
(laughing)

158
00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:04.731
<v ->Yeah, you have to shrowd all this</v>

159
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.236
into stories...

160
00:06:06.236 --> 00:06:07.044
<v Hostess>Right.</v>

161
00:06:07.044 --> 00:06:10.405
<v ->and concepts, very large concepts,</v>

162
00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:12.973
and stories and so on.

163
00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.610
But, when you actually

164
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.225
see it that way and you

165
00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:19.905
look at the stories and

166
00:06:19.905 --> 00:06:24.115
all the folklore in all these traditions

167
00:06:24.115 --> 00:06:25.483
from that time,

168
00:06:25.483 --> 00:06:27.495
from very ancient time.

169
00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:30.214
It's remarkable,

170
00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:32.166
the coordination, first of all,

171
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:34.499
of the information across the planet.

172
00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:37.924
But as well, the message that's given.

173
00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:41.546
Part of that message has to do

174
00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:44.027
with very powerful technology,

175
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:46.619
according to what I've found,

176
00:06:46.624 --> 00:06:50.017
that was given to human beings

177
00:06:50.017 --> 00:06:53.009
in that earlier evolution.

178
00:06:53.365 --> 00:06:58.259
It has great potential to transform our civilization

179
00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.681
into a civilization of abundance,

180
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:06.469
a civilization that has...

181
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:08.318
a peaceful civilization.

182
00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:10.564
A civilization that has the capacity

183
00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:14.802
to explore very large spans of our universe,

184
00:07:14.802 --> 00:07:16.134
and so on.

185
00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:20.430
I think that,

186
00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:23.577
in that folklore is very, very important

187
00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:28.422
advanced physics and technological information,

188
00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:30.885
and that some of the monuments that we find

189
00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:34.221
that defy our capacity to build them today.

190
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.292
Like the pyramids and very

191
00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:41.262
enormous blocks of granite that were moved,

192
00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:44.310
in some cases, hundreds of miles.

193
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.496
<v Hostess>And the accuracy of the geometry...</v>

194
00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:49.670
It can really not even be replicated today.

195
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.814
<v ->That's right,</v>

196
00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:53.588
with all the engineering that we have today

197
00:07:53.588 --> 00:07:55.578
and all the technology that we have today,

198
00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:58.109
wed would not be able to reproduce.

199
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.866
I think those are large evidence

200
00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:02.730
that we have a lot to learn

201
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.885
from these ancient civilizations.

202
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.956
But, we have to look at them

203
00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:11.525
not only in philisophical terms

204
00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:14.158
but in actual physics

205
00:08:14.158 --> 00:08:16.631
and mathematical understanding

206
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:18.349
and that from there,

207
00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:20.233
and that's what I did,

208
00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.905
a whole new engineering

209
00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:25.228
technology can emerge.

210
00:08:25.228 --> 00:08:27.809
And that technology is a technology that

211
00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:30.465
directly interacts with the vacuum,

212
00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:33.781
directly interacts with the source of creation.

213
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:35.822
<v Hostess>And what is that?</v>

214
00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:37.167
I mean, if you want to explain

215
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:39.843
some of the essential building blocks.

216
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.972
<v ->I think that if you</v>

217
00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:44.811
read between the lines in these

218
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.502
ancient texts and all this, it is crystal-based.

219
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:52.959
I mean, most of our advanced electronics today

220
00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.287
are crystal-based.

221
00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:57.755
So, it's actually,

222
00:08:58.232 --> 00:09:00.714
not so far-fetched.

223
00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:03.724
And then, it seems to have

224
00:09:03.724 --> 00:09:05.202
a very...

225
00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:09.380
it seems to have plasma involved,

226
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.807
it's very radiant,

227
00:09:10.807 --> 00:09:13.767
it has a capacity to create gravitational fields,

228
00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:15.789
to control gravitational fields.

229
00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.591
Most importantly it seems to

230
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.090
come in direct resonance with the human spirit,

231
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.860
the human mind.

232
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:28.282
Any initiate that walked into the room

233
00:09:28.282 --> 00:09:30.904
with these objects

234
00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.179
that are found in all these different cultures,

235
00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:35.042
in Hebrew culture, it was called

236
00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:39.018
the Ark of the Covenant of God.

237
00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:42.297
In the Quran,

238
00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:44.544
it's called the Qabar.

239
00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.637
The Dark Crystal.

240
00:09:46.637 --> 00:09:48.306
In the Sumerian texts,

241
00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:49.856
it's called a Dark Sun

242
00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.561
or the Black Sun.

243
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:55.395
I believe it produces a tiny singularity,

244
00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.381
a small mini-blackhole.

245
00:10:00.689 --> 00:10:03.637
It becomes interactive with

246
00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:07.611
your consciousness, when you're close to it.

247
00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:10.917
So, there's a training that's necessary

248
00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:15.506
and there's a level of preparation necessary

249
00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:18.251
so when you look at these ancient civilizations

250
00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:21.488
they talk about the initiates going through

251
00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:24.024
all sorts of levels of initiation

252
00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:28.902
before being able to go into the Holy of Holy,

253
00:10:28.902 --> 00:10:31.447
where the object is kept

254
00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:35.267
and all the things that occur there.

255
00:10:35.452 --> 00:10:38.682
I think we're about to rediscover this knowledge.

256
00:10:38.823 --> 00:10:41.058
I think we're about to rediscover this technology but,

257
00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:44.111
this time we are going to discover it.

258
00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:46.726
It's not going to be given to us.

259
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:48.165
<v Hostess>Would you say in a sense</v>

260
00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:49.243
it's already been given?

261
00:10:49.243 --> 00:10:51.062
All the clues have been left behind.

262
00:10:51.062 --> 00:10:52.319
<v ->That's right!</v>

263
00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:53.743
Everything we need is there.

264
00:10:53.743 --> 00:10:57.525
And it really is just about us awakening to it

265
00:10:57.541 --> 00:11:00.979
and I think that these Sun gods

266
00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:04.098
not only left us all the information necessary

267
00:11:04.098 --> 00:11:06.851
but, on top of it, left us calendars

268
00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:08.352
telling us

269
00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:09.954
you guys have to have this

270
00:11:09.954 --> 00:11:12.482
figured by this time.

271
00:11:12.612 --> 00:11:15.260
Because otherwise, it might not be so good,

272
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.772
you guys need this information,

273
00:11:17.772 --> 00:11:19.456
need this technology,

274
00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:22.199
because changes are going to occur on your planet

275
00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:24.221
in this region of time.

276
00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:25.235
<v Hostess>This is interesting,</v>

277
00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:26.237
because I looked at that

278
00:11:26.237 --> 00:11:28.103
and then I look at, say,

279
00:11:28.103 --> 00:11:30.044
in the DVD on the

280
00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:31.496
resonance project that you have,

281
00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:33.557
you start taking people through

282
00:11:33.557 --> 00:11:35.939
the various elements of

283
00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.841
space and time and the bending

284
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:41.008
of space and time

285
00:11:41.008 --> 00:11:42.349
and the implications that

286
00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:43.828
you take everyone forward

287
00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:44.742
and everybody should watch this,

288
00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.001
it's fascinating, by the way.

289
00:11:46.001 --> 00:11:46.598
<v ->Thank you.</v>

290
00:11:46.598 --> 00:11:48.351
<v Hostess>You move through into</v>

291
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:50.325
some of the more ancient validation

292
00:11:50.325 --> 00:11:51.774
of these concepts, which would be

293
00:11:51.774 --> 00:11:54.368
what you were just talking about there.

294
00:11:54.368 --> 00:11:55.440
As I'm looking at it,

295
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.246
it seems again we're dealing with

296
00:11:57.246 --> 00:11:59.454
an issue of density.

297
00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:02.368
If you look at

298
00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:03.638
a lot of what's being told

299
00:12:03.638 --> 00:12:05.889
about this period of time,

300
00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:08.760
that the Earth and the field,

301
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.020
and perhaps our entire solar system

302
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.105
are going through a density change.

303
00:12:13.157 --> 00:12:14.063
If you want to call it that.

304
00:12:14.063 --> 00:12:16.957
Some say a sub-dimensional or dimensional shift,

305
00:12:16.957 --> 00:12:17.864
which is density.

306
00:12:18.277 --> 00:12:19.010
<v ->Yes.</v>

307
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.937
<v Hostess>So,</v>

308
00:12:19.937 --> 00:12:21.637
these people were masters of being

309
00:12:21.637 --> 00:12:24.061
able to move density

310
00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:26.052
and actually change density.

311
00:12:26.198 --> 00:12:27.321
<v ->Uh huh.</v>

312
00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.267
<v Hostess>It would appear.</v>

313
00:12:28.267 --> 00:12:29.562
From everything that we're seeing.

314
00:12:29.562 --> 00:12:31.932
<v ->Well, definitely creating</v>

315
00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:34.066
a mini-singularity is

316
00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:37.436
mastering our capacity to

317
00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:41.279
produce very highly dense

318
00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:44.460
dynamics, of field interaction

319
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.631
in a very small amount of space.

320
00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:52.040
In that sense, definitely.

321
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.449
I think that

322
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:57.133
all of our universe is driven

323
00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.055
by a change in density,

324
00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:00.257
there's always...

325
00:13:00.257 --> 00:13:02.275
the vacuum structure is never

326
00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:04.041
completely empty.

327
00:13:04.041 --> 00:13:05.950
There's always fluctuation

328
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.947
but there is a large difference between

329
00:13:08.947 --> 00:13:11.589
the fluctuations at the universal level

330
00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:13.838
and the fluctuation inside the atom.

331
00:13:13.838 --> 00:13:18.467
There's a huge gradient change in density.

332
00:13:18.467 --> 00:13:19.685
So, it's like,

333
00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:22.993
pulling the plug on your tub.

334
00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:27.436
The structure of space is constantly spiraling, as it were.

335
00:13:27.436 --> 00:13:29.055
<v Hostess>Angular momentum you call it.</v>

336
00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:29.900
<v ->That's right!</v>

337
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.054
Angular momentum is generated.

338
00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:36.068
And that's what drives all of creation

339
00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:38.965
and so, to understand that,

340
00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:41.268
and to apply that to the way

341
00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:42.805
we do technology and to the way

342
00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:45.849
we think of our self, and so on.

343
00:13:46.602 --> 00:13:48.619
We start to harmonize

344
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.820
our technology and our consciousness

345
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.281
to these fundamental movements of creation,

346
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.389
these fundamental dynamics of creation

347
00:13:57.389 --> 00:14:00.541
and that's, I think, what's missing

348
00:14:00.643 --> 00:14:04.215
in our technological world.

349
00:14:04.608 --> 00:14:07.042
Our technology is actually

350
00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:09.809
based much more on fighting

351
00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:12.130
the forces of nature.

352
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.892
<v Hostess>Fighting them?</v>

353
00:14:12.892 --> 00:14:13.378
<v ->Yeah.</v>

354
00:14:13.378 --> 00:14:14.073
<v Hostess>Yes.</v>

355
00:14:14.073 --> 00:14:15.510
<v ->Yeah.</v>

356
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.872
<v Hostess>In our mastery of them.</v>

357
00:14:17.872 --> 00:14:19.286
<v ->Yeah, and it's a very male</v>

358
00:14:19.286 --> 00:14:20.932
approach to things.

359
00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:22.493
For instance,

360
00:14:22.493 --> 00:14:24.695
in order to overcome gravity,

361
00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:28.396
we built large, phallic symbols,

362
00:14:28.396 --> 00:14:31.855
we put it full of fuel in there.

363
00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:33.676
Highly explosive material,

364
00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:36.131
we put a little capsule on top of it

365
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:38.895
and we find volunteers to sit in it.

366
00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:41.407
And then, we light up the bottom

367
00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:43.963
and start praying that

368
00:14:43.963 --> 00:14:46.221
the whole thing is not gonna explode

369
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:48.650
and we shoot these people up

370
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.215
and then at the top, "poof",

371
00:14:52.215 --> 00:14:53.954
a small ejaculation and

372
00:14:53.954 --> 00:14:57.813
this little capsule gets pulled

373
00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:00.469
orbiting a few miles up.

374
00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:01.937
All this energy,

375
00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:03.234
all this power

376
00:15:03.234 --> 00:15:05.603
necessary to defy,

377
00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:07.984
the gravitational field...

378
00:15:07.984 --> 00:15:11.200
Instead of actually understanding

379
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.010
what produces gravity,

380
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.144
how it gets there,

381
00:15:14.144 --> 00:15:17.792
why is space-time curving and so on,

382
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:22.531
and then working with it.

383
00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:26.076
Entering the flow of the dynamics

384
00:15:26.076 --> 00:15:29.416
of the gravitational fields and

385
00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:32.805
actually learning to play with them

386
00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:34.628
so that we can produce our own

387
00:15:34.628 --> 00:15:36.468
gravitational field and then

388
00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.927
if we can produce

389
00:15:37.927 --> 00:15:39.169
our own gravitational fields,

390
00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:41.472
we can go anywhere we want

391
00:15:41.472 --> 00:15:43.549
with very little energy.

392
00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.923
<v Hostess>So, let's go to,</v>

393
00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:46.858
of all those cultures we talked about,

394
00:15:46.858 --> 00:15:48.347
let's go back to Egypt because

395
00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.679
this is an area that you did

396
00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:51.459
focus on and you came up with

397
00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:54.592
a theory that I immediately was getting chills

398
00:15:54.592 --> 00:15:55.995
as soon as I heard this one.

399
00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:57.482
I thought, "Yes".

400
00:15:57.482 --> 00:15:58.853
I've interviewed other people,

401
00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:02.098
John Anthony West, Robert Shrock, and William Henry

402
00:16:02.098 --> 00:16:03.586
and others,

403
00:16:03.586 --> 00:16:05.179
who are all bringing pieces of this,

404
00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:06.130
dating and so forth.

405
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.765
John Anthony West saying the pyramids

406
00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:10.064
may be more like 36,000...

407
00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:11.821
from 36,000 B.C.

408
00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:12.590
That's very old,

409
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.253
almost 40,000 years ago.

410
00:16:14.253 --> 00:16:15.495
Not 4,000, 40,000.

411
00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:16.239
<v ->That's right.</v>

412
00:16:16.239 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Hostess>So, we're having to be</v>

413
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.907
confronted with the fact that

414
00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:20.704
there appeared to be intelligent,

415
00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:23.169
far more intelligent cultures long ago.

416
00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:24.700
And they've left these, as you say,

417
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.137
they've detailed what they've left behind in a way.

418
00:16:27.137 --> 00:16:28.197
As we're getting ready

419
00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:29.486
to move into the need.

420
00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.673
<v ->Right, it's not appropriate</v>

421
00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:34.117
to carbon date

422
00:16:34.117 --> 00:16:37.785
the fire of this little guy

423
00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:40.688
that did a fire there 5,000 years ago

424
00:16:40.688 --> 00:16:41.933
beside the building

425
00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:44.402
and assume that it's the same guy

426
00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:45.731
that built the building.

427
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:46.660
<v Hostess>...built the building, exactly.</v>

428
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.725
So, we know that's blowing apart at the seams.

429
00:16:48.725 --> 00:16:50.595
We know that the technology that built

430
00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:52.873
the pyramids is virtually impossible

431
00:16:52.873 --> 00:16:54.874
to explain in any human terms

432
00:16:54.874 --> 00:16:56.519
of understanding what was available

433
00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:57.720
a few thousand years ago.

434
00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.368
<v ->Yeah, much of the data</v>

435
00:16:59.368 --> 00:17:00.699
that you look at

436
00:17:00.699 --> 00:17:02.230
when you study the pyramids

437
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.814
just does not add up.

438
00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:04.629
<v Hostess>Doesn't add up.</v>

439
00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:05.862
<v ->No, absolutely not.</v>

440
00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:07.621
<v Hostess>You came up with a piece, though,</v>

441
00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:09.550
that was so fascinating to me.

442
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.996
The Lore of the Ark of the Covenant of God.

443
00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:12.692
<v ->Yes.</v>

444
00:17:12.692 --> 00:17:14.255
<v Hostess>Mkay.</v>

445
00:17:14.255 --> 00:17:17.867
You put that in a very specific

446
00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:20.937
location in terms of it's actual usefulness.

447
00:17:20.937 --> 00:17:22.621
And this is an area that has been

448
00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:23.386
much debated.

449
00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:24.911
What is a sarcophagus,

450
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:26.623
in the center of the chamber,

451
00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:27.953
in the great pyramid?

452
00:17:27.953 --> 00:17:29.824
<v ->Or in any pyramid.</v>

453
00:17:29.824 --> 00:17:31.065
<v Hostess>Yes, or in any pyramid.</v>

454
00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:32.188
What is that all about?

455
00:17:32.188 --> 00:17:33.869
Can you take that story forward

456
00:17:33.869 --> 00:17:35.529
in it's implications of understanding

457
00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:36.631
this in this way.

458
00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:37.492
<v ->Well, you know,</v>

459
00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:39.268
there has been an assumption that's been made

460
00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.802
in the archaeology community,

461
00:17:41.802 --> 00:17:44.726
that the pyramids were tombs,

462
00:17:44.836 --> 00:17:46.558
tombs for pharaohs,

463
00:17:47.008 --> 00:17:47.868
or, you know,

464
00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:50.375
kings of all sorts around the world, like,

465
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:52.080
in the Mayan and Incan and so on.

466
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.102
But, the facts are

467
00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:01.503
no mummy,

468
00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:04.523
has been found inside a pyramid.

469
00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:06.933
Many of the pyramids were sealed.

470
00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:10.832
You know, 20 ton plugs,

471
00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:13.774
granite boulders and

472
00:18:13.774 --> 00:18:18.443
perfectly camouflaged in the surface of the pyramids,

473
00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:20.872
so that you couldn't find any entrance.

474
00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:21.870
In some of the pyramids,

475
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.147
they actually had to dynamite themselves in.

476
00:18:24.147 --> 00:18:28.617
And luckily, they found tunnels or

477
00:18:28.617 --> 00:18:31.560
ramps and so on

478
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.658
and found the entrance eventually, but,

479
00:18:34.508 --> 00:18:36.957
then they would find these sarcophagus

480
00:18:36.957 --> 00:18:38.129
in the middle

481
00:18:38.129 --> 00:18:40.702
and many of them were still

482
00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.302
with their cover on.

483
00:18:42.302 --> 00:18:46.534
20 ton, you know, boulders in some cases,

484
00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:49.065
like, 20 ton slabs of

485
00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:52.703
perfectly polished granite.

486
00:18:53.188 --> 00:18:55.795
And in some cases,

487
00:18:55.795 --> 00:18:59.095
they were sealed still, and so on,

488
00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:03.549
and they would remove these enormous

489
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.521
covers.

490
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:09.697
And typically, the sarcophagus would be empty.

491
00:19:09.697 --> 00:19:13.164
Now, when you look at

492
00:19:13.484 --> 00:19:16.692
popular books on ancient Egypt, and so on,

493
00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:19.487
they typically associate the mummy's

494
00:19:19.487 --> 00:19:22.294
with the sarcophagus

495
00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.350
and with the pyramids.

496
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.687
And they give you the impression that,

497
00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:29.352
that's where the mummies were found.

498
00:19:29.352 --> 00:19:33.396
But, actually, when these sarcophagus were opened,

499
00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:35.996
they were all empty.

500
00:19:35.996 --> 00:19:39.809
Mummies were found in underground

501
00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:43.169
tombs, that had nothing to do with the pyramids.

502
00:19:43.205 --> 00:19:45.414
Pharaoh mummies were never found

503
00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:48.474
in pyramids.

504
00:19:49.197 --> 00:19:53.477
The assumption that these things were built

505
00:19:53.477 --> 00:19:56.373
to bury pharaohs is a very large assumption.

506
00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:57.758
Never mind the fact that,

507
00:19:57.758 --> 00:19:59.062
you would think,

508
00:19:59.062 --> 00:20:01.831
that after placing two-million,

509
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:04.904
three-hundred thousand stones,

510
00:20:04.984 --> 00:20:06.760
in this incredible monument,

511
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.525
the most precise monument ever built on Earth,

512
00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:12.377
the largest, the most massive monument,

513
00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:16.358
that the pharaoh would have put their plaque somewhere.

514
00:20:16.385 --> 00:20:17.409
(laughing)

515
00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:19.172
Saying, "This is where I lie", you know?

516
00:20:19.172 --> 00:20:23.186
It's not like they were shy about writing,

517
00:20:23.186 --> 00:20:26.854
tombs where we did find the pharaohs.

518
00:20:26.854 --> 00:20:28.142
<v Hostess>There's plenty written.</v>

519
00:20:28.142 --> 00:20:29.493
<v ->There's plenty written,</v>

520
00:20:29.493 --> 00:20:31.753
it covered all the walls.

521
00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:32.484
<v Hostess>Yes.</v>

522
00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:33.296
<v ->Never mind that there's</v>

523
00:20:33.296 --> 00:20:35.726
no walls anywhere,

524
00:20:35.726 --> 00:20:39.202
in all of these thousands and thousands

525
00:20:39.202 --> 00:20:43.491
of documents, you know, documents,

526
00:20:43.491 --> 00:20:45.944
hieroglyphic documents,

527
00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:48.474
that say's, "We built the pyramids,

528
00:20:48.474 --> 00:20:50.221
and this is the way we did it."

529
00:20:50.844 --> 00:20:51.749
You would think

530
00:20:51.749 --> 00:20:53.279
that if these people accomplished

531
00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:54.950
such a task, that they would at...

532
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.514
You know, they told us everthing

533
00:20:56.514 --> 00:20:57.884
else about their culture.

534
00:20:57.884 --> 00:20:58.522
<v Hostess>Right.</v>

535
00:20:58.522 --> 00:21:00.392
<v ->What they ate, how they ate,</v>

536
00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.950
you know, everything else,

537
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.950
I mean, all the details of their culture

538
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.339
they left in all these scripts.

539
00:21:07.357 --> 00:21:09.543
But, nowhere does it say that we built the pyramid

540
00:21:09.543 --> 00:21:11.344
and that's how we did it.

541
00:21:11.344 --> 00:21:16.164
In fact, there's much more...

542
00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:19.703
evidence that they are talking about the Sun gods

543
00:21:19.703 --> 00:21:21.274
coming and doing this.

544
00:21:21.274 --> 00:21:22.007
<v Hostess>Yes.</v>

545
00:21:22.007 --> 00:21:22.842
That exists.

546
00:21:22.842 --> 00:21:24.444
<v ->They do not claim</v>

547
00:21:24.444 --> 00:21:25.911
to have done this.

548
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:26.583
So.

549
00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:27.812
<v Hostess>So, the Ark...?</v>

550
00:21:27.812 --> 00:21:30.621
<v ->So, then, when I studied the</v>

551
00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:33.566
Ark of the Covenant, I..

552
00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:38.527
I started to realize when I studied the Hebrew texts

553
00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:41.330
and the way that Moses

554
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.569
left Egypt and so on,

555
00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:48.896
I started to realize that there was something "fishy",

556
00:21:49.206 --> 00:21:54.011
descriptions that come much later in the Bible texts,

557
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:55.451
about the ark,

558
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:57.375
where it describes the subject.

559
00:21:57.375 --> 00:21:59.311
First of all, the Ark of the Covenant of God

560
00:21:59.311 --> 00:22:01.332
is the center

561
00:22:01.472 --> 00:22:03.352
of the Hebrew faith.

562
00:22:03.352 --> 00:22:06.722
It's not some relic that was kind of

563
00:22:06.722 --> 00:22:08.516
a nice thing to have in the temple.

564
00:22:08.516 --> 00:22:13.457
It was the center of all of their...

565
00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:14.591
devotion.

566
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:17.151
And they actually built the largest temple

567
00:22:17.151 --> 00:22:19.885
ever built on Earth to put it in the middle,

568
00:22:19.885 --> 00:22:20.991
in the Holy of Holy.

569
00:22:20.991 --> 00:22:24.065
It wasn't just some nice...

570
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.203
box that they had.

571
00:22:26.203 --> 00:22:28.374
It seems to have all sorts of powers

572
00:22:28.374 --> 00:22:29.925
that defy gravity,

573
00:22:29.925 --> 00:22:32.598
that did all of these things.

574
00:22:33.128 --> 00:22:34.346
You know, I started to realize,

575
00:22:34.346 --> 00:22:37.214
wait a minute, these guys are not talking

576
00:22:37.214 --> 00:22:41.021
about some god, with a beard, you know,

577
00:22:41.021 --> 00:22:43.287
sitting on a throne somewhere,

578
00:22:43.287 --> 00:22:45.561
observing creation and hitting you on

579
00:22:45.561 --> 00:22:47.453
the head if you did something wrong.

580
00:22:47.453 --> 00:22:52.135
But actually, talked about this very physical object

581
00:22:52.175 --> 00:22:54.540
that had all sorts of power.

582
00:22:54.634 --> 00:22:58.037
And when I looked at the description of that object,

583
00:22:58.037 --> 00:22:58.940
it was said that

584
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.112
there was a vortex above it

585
00:23:01.112 --> 00:23:03.376
that they called the Pillar of Light.

586
00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:05.869
<v Hostess>Angular momentum, spirals.</v>

587
00:23:05.869 --> 00:23:06.978
<v ->Yes, that spiral.</v>

588
00:23:06.978 --> 00:23:07.834
That vortex.

589
00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:09.493
That tornado above it,

590
00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:10.926
and so on.

591
00:23:10.946 --> 00:23:13.020
It's said that God talked through

592
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.257
that point, that, that was the seat of God.

593
00:23:17.257 --> 00:23:19.925
And then when you look at the word "God".

594
00:23:19.925 --> 00:23:23.487
It's a translation of the word Tetragrammaton,

595
00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:25.406
and all this, and then you can get into

596
00:23:25.406 --> 00:23:27.279
the Qabbalistic tradition and all this.

597
00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:30.272
And then I looked at the movement

598
00:23:30.272 --> 00:23:34.591
of the tribe of Israel, from Egypt.

599
00:23:34.941 --> 00:23:37.508
It says very clearly

600
00:23:37.508 --> 00:23:40.273
that as they move away from Egypt

601
00:23:40.273 --> 00:23:45.273
that they are following a Pillar of Light at night,

602
00:23:45.355 --> 00:23:48.493
or a Pillar of Cloud during the day.

603
00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:52.659
Very, very similar to the description

604
00:23:52.819 --> 00:23:56.097
that is given later about the Ark of the Covenant.

605
00:23:56.097 --> 00:23:59.100
So, they are following this object

606
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.675
and then they part

607
00:24:01.675 --> 00:24:04.115
the Red Sea with it.

608
00:24:04.115 --> 00:24:05.152
<v Hostess>Yes.</v>

609
00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:07.363
<v ->Now, if you read only that section</v>

610
00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:09.997
then it's not clear that they are using the Ark

611
00:24:09.997 --> 00:24:11.277
to do this because, supposedly,

612
00:24:11.277 --> 00:24:14.591
they only built the Ark after parting the Red Sea

613
00:24:14.611 --> 00:24:16.176
at the foot of Mt. Sinai.

614
00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:18.117
What I believe happened

615
00:24:18.117 --> 00:24:21.123
and it's clear in the traditions of

616
00:24:21.123 --> 00:24:22.611
this region of the world, that,

617
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:26.162
the word of God can neither be talked about, and so on,

618
00:24:26.162 --> 00:24:29.672
so that they would never actually give you

619
00:24:29.672 --> 00:24:32.885
the information about the thing that they were following,

620
00:24:32.885 --> 00:24:35.117
what it looked like, how it worked.

621
00:24:35.117 --> 00:24:38.034
But, later on they built a box

622
00:24:38.034 --> 00:24:40.171
made out of gold

623
00:24:40.171 --> 00:24:43.615
to isolate it, and to transport it

624
00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:45.782
for 40 years through the desert.

625
00:24:45.782 --> 00:24:47.249
<v Hostess>This also has an</v>

626
00:24:47.249 --> 00:24:49.048
interesting implication historically.

627
00:24:49.048 --> 00:24:50.478
When you look at the character

628
00:24:50.478 --> 00:24:53.145
that was, that is known as "Moses",

629
00:24:53.145 --> 00:24:56.083
and their origins as a very highly initiated

630
00:24:56.083 --> 00:24:58.294
member of Egyptian royalty.

631
00:24:58.294 --> 00:24:59.715
<v ->That's right.</v>

632
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:03.814
So he had access to this very advanced knowledge,

633
00:25:03.814 --> 00:25:06.767
this very advanced, what I believe technology

634
00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:10.205
and I think that's why the pharaoh went after him.

635
00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:12.431
Because when the pharaoh told him

636
00:25:12.431 --> 00:25:14.408
he could leave with the tribe of Israel,

637
00:25:14.408 --> 00:25:16.473
I don't think he meant,

638
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:19.669
"You can leave with our power source."

639
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:21.937
And I think that's what happened,

640
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:24.386
is that Moses, being a high initiate,

641
00:25:24.386 --> 00:25:28.786
had access and he took this with him.

642
00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:31.651
When the pharaoh discovered this

643
00:25:31.721 --> 00:25:34.382
and went after him,

644
00:25:34.382 --> 00:25:35.733
it was too late,

645
00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:38.733
he had already opened the Red Sea and crossed.

646
00:25:38.733 --> 00:25:42.401
And if you need to have confidence

647
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:45.666
that the Red Sea was opened using

648
00:25:45.666 --> 00:25:46.674
the power of the Ark,

649
00:25:46.674 --> 00:25:48.707
then look at Joshua,

650
00:25:48.707 --> 00:25:51.214
crossing the Jordan, you know,

651
00:25:51.214 --> 00:25:52.619
this is much later,

652
00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:56.720
at the end of the journey of the Israelite's.

653
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.614
When they arrive at the Jordan river

654
00:25:59.614 --> 00:26:01.416
and it's running at flood level.

655
00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:05.254
There is a very, very specific description

656
00:26:05.254 --> 00:26:08.887
of using the Ark to stop the course of water,

657
00:26:08.887 --> 00:26:10.247
open the water so that

658
00:26:10.247 --> 00:26:12.582
the tribes can cross and then

659
00:26:12.582 --> 00:26:14.069
close them again.

660
00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:17.503
It says, even literally,

661
00:26:17.503 --> 00:26:20.233
and this is the way we opened the Red Sea.

662
00:26:20.233 --> 00:26:21.167
<v Hostess>Yes.</v>

663
00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:22.308
This is amazing.

664
00:26:22.308 --> 00:26:23.508
Yes.

665
00:26:23.508 --> 00:26:26.012
So this really,

666
00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:28.473
obviously, gives people a lot contend with

667
00:26:28.473 --> 00:26:30.016
on the belief's system level.

668
00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:30.685
<v ->Mhmm.</v>

669
00:26:30.685 --> 00:26:31.848
<v Hostess>But, it also gives</v>

670
00:26:31.848 --> 00:26:33.183
us a lot of wonderful stuff to start

671
00:26:33.183 --> 00:26:35.084
thinking about on a technological level.

672
00:26:35.084 --> 00:26:35.724
<v ->That's right.</v>

673
00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:38.112
<v Hostess>Right now, our technology</v>

674
00:26:38.112 --> 00:26:40.210
is really key to starting to heal us

675
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.992
even on a belief system's level.

676
00:26:41.992 --> 00:26:43.417
If we keep going in this direction

677
00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:45.399
I think we can all see where we're headed

678
00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:47.837
if we go in this primitive direction path

679
00:26:47.837 --> 00:26:48.725
that we're on right now.

680
00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:51.107
So let's take forward then, into now.

681
00:26:51.107 --> 00:26:51.733
<v ->Right.</v>

682
00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:53.633
I think that this all,

683
00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:56.566
you know, all these stories, from all around the world.

684
00:26:56.566 --> 00:26:58.939
The Kaba, the Black Sun and all this.

685
00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:01.199
They're all...

686
00:27:01.739 --> 00:27:03.617
pushing us, leading us

687
00:27:03.617 --> 00:27:07.821
to the possibility of transforming our civilization,

688
00:27:07.821 --> 00:27:09.158
from a civilization...

689
00:27:09.158 --> 00:27:12.088
that you know, believed that there's

690
00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:13.296
a limited amount of goods,

691
00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:15.161
that there's scarcity,

692
00:27:15.161 --> 00:27:17.516
that there's a limited amount of space

693
00:27:17.516 --> 00:27:19.000
that we've gotta fight for.

694
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.230
To a society that realizes that

695
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.229
there is an infinite amount of energy.

696
00:27:24.229 --> 00:27:27.805
It's everywhere, it's in the vacuum everywhere.

697
00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:30.172
That we just gotta learn to dance with it.

698
00:27:30.172 --> 00:27:32.982
And that as soon as we do that

699
00:27:32.982 --> 00:27:35.352
we'll have, you know,

700
00:27:35.352 --> 00:27:37.379
not only an infinite amount of energy,

701
00:27:37.379 --> 00:27:40.452
but, an infinite amount of good available to us

702
00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:42.752
because we'll be able to control gravitational fields

703
00:27:42.752 --> 00:27:45.549
and we'll be able to explore our solar system

704
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:47.696
and beyond, so,

705
00:27:47.696 --> 00:27:49.949
there's no limitation.

706
00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:52.274
That the limitations are...

707
00:27:52.274 --> 00:27:56.496
is only a result of our capacity to imagine

708
00:27:56.856 --> 00:28:01.232
a future of abundance.

709
00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:03.836
I think we're on the verge

710
00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:05.719
of making that breakthrough.

711
00:28:05.719 --> 00:28:08.056
<v Hostess>You travel in some</v>

712
00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:09.979
lesser known circles, than,

713
00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:11.580
the masses would be aware of.

714
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.189
<v ->Yes.</v>

715
00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:13.315
<v Hostess>As do we,</v>

716
00:28:13.315 --> 00:28:15.358
and we're aware of a lot of technologies

717
00:28:15.358 --> 00:28:16.588
that are starting to emerge.

718
00:28:16.588 --> 00:28:17.091
<v ->Yes.</v>

719
00:28:17.091 --> 00:28:18.447
<v Hostess>The reality is,</v>

720
00:28:18.447 --> 00:28:20.909
in your opinion...

721
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:22.841
how close are we?

722
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:25.998
You know these technologies exist already.

723
00:28:25.998 --> 00:28:26.589
<v ->Right.</v>

724
00:28:26.589 --> 00:28:28.736
I think it's evident.

725
00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:32.279
The technological issue

726
00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:35.169
is not much of an issue anymore

727
00:28:35.169 --> 00:28:37.985
It is much more our capacity to

728
00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:41.688
have the appropriate structures to allow it to emerge

729
00:28:41.688 --> 00:28:44.782
and to allow it to transform our society,

730
00:28:44.782 --> 00:28:46.390
our financial structure,

731
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.823
our political structure and all this

732
00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:49.947
has to adjust to it.

733
00:28:49.947 --> 00:28:52.163
But, I think it's evident,

734
00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:55.789
and I'm so excited about it.

735
00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:58.874
I think we're just entering a...

736
00:28:58.874 --> 00:29:01.429
A world of abundance,

737
00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:04.405
a world of...

738
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:06.610
transformation.

739
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.903
And that we're really...

740
00:29:09.903 --> 00:29:14.903
gonna, literally, as the ancient texts told us,

741
00:29:15.512 --> 00:29:18.562
we are going to ascend at this time.

742
00:29:18.562 --> 00:29:20.283
Not only philosophically but, actually,

743
00:29:20.283 --> 00:29:23.810
literally, become Star Child,

744
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.302
Star beings, you know,

745
00:29:26.302 --> 00:29:29.544
Galactic entities.

746
00:29:29.822 --> 00:29:30.695
<v Hostess>On that note,</v>

747
00:29:30.695 --> 00:29:31.835
you've certainly done your part and more.

748
00:29:31.835 --> 00:29:34.101
And you continue to do so,

749
00:29:34.101 --> 00:29:36.002
and I thank you so much for your time.

750
00:29:36.002 --> 00:29:36.834
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

751
00:29:36.834 --> 00:29:39.798
Thank you for having me.

752
00:29:40.448 --> 00:29:42.207
<v ->To learn more about Nassim's</v>

753
00:29:42.207 --> 00:29:43.441
Resonance Project go to

754
00:29:43.441 --> 00:29:45.204
theresonanceproject.org

755
00:29:45.204 --> 00:29:47.048
I highly reccomend his six-hour

756
00:29:47.048 --> 00:29:49.377
DVD series where he walks you through the science,

757
00:29:49.377 --> 00:29:50.306
I loved it.

758
00:29:50.306 --> 00:29:51.275
Until next time,

759
00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:53.133
Thanks for watching CMN.
