00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:04.180
(soft music)

2
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:15.107
<v ->Marc Allen is the publisher of New World Library</v>

3
00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:17.011
which publishes the work of a number of authors

4
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.242
I've already interviewed.

5
00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:19.972
The reason I wanted to speak with him

6
00:00:19.972 --> 00:00:22.874
is because I noticed a plaque on his office wall that said

7
00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:25.614
best business to work for in a recent poll.

8
00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:28.482
That means there has to be a conscious boss at the top

9
00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:30.513
and it turned out that Marc was the boss.

10
00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.417
i absolutely loved this conversation

11
00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.554
with a man who is wise, quirky,

12
00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:36.626
and by his own admission, lazy.

13
00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:39.594
Nonetheless, very successful in the true meaning of the word

14
00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:42.248
and I believe he has something to teach us.

15
00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.962
<v Voiceover>One of the reasons I'm so happy to talk to you</v>

16
00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.608
is because when we come in here,

17
00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:51.328
into New World Library, I noticed there's a

18
00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.339
little plaque at the entryway.

19
00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.697
It talks about how you've been voted

20
00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.109
best business to work for.

21
00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.502
And that always impresses me

22
00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:00.881
because it means you're walking your talk

23
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.181
and you're doing something right

24
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:03.688
and that's what encouraged me to want to

25
00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:07.156
read about your personal story as a publisher.

26
00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:09.711
And I've interviewed a lot of your authors.

27
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:12.532
And why don't we take it off from the early part

28
00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:14.192
of your life where your life looked

29
00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:15.527
nothing like it did now.

30
00:01:15.527 --> 00:01:17.327
You talk about how you had the

31
00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.699
opposite of the Midas touch going in your life.

32
00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:21.499
<v ->Right.</v>

33
00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:22.261
(interviewer laughs)

34
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.930
In my 20s, yes, I had the opposite of the Midas touch.

35
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.509
Everything I touched fell apart.

36
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.778
I was born with something, or very early on

37
00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.589
I got something that's been very good

38
00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:33.913
and served me very well.

39
00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:36.084
I knew it was important doing what I loved.

40
00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:38.986
My dad lobbied that I should go into business.

41
00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.796
I knew that was not what I wanted to do.

42
00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:44.289
I didn't love the idea of going into business.

43
00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.785
I wanted to be an actor when I was a teenager,

44
00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:47.888
and a musician.

45
00:01:47.888 --> 00:01:49.998
And I had a band and did theater,

46
00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:52.805
so I was a theater major in college

47
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:55.742
and then joined a theater company that fell apart

48
00:01:55.742 --> 00:01:59.442
and joined another theater company that fell apart.

49
00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:02.783
And then I wandered around, I went to a Zen center

50
00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:05.079
and got kicked out for breaking the rules.

51
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.655
There were so many rules.

52
00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:09.890
And I wandered around the spiritual smorgasbord

53
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.708
of Berkeley we called it

54
00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:15.583
in the late 60s, early 70s, mid 70s.

55
00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:18.688
And ended up having a rock band

56
00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:20.093
and that fell apart.

57
00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:21.567
And then I turned 30.

58
00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:23.329
<v Voiceover>You had another couple jobs in there</v>

59
00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.429
that you didn't do well at.

60
00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:28.362
As I recall, dishwasher, busboy, got fired, too slow.

61
00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:31.032
<v ->Yes. Many short term jobs.</v>

62
00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:34.004
I lasted two days as a busboy, a dishwasher,

63
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.374
because I was too slow.

64
00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:36.779
He wanted me to work so fast.

65
00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.341
He wanted me to dry spoons like, shoo shoo shoo,

66
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.578
for minimum wage, you know.

67
00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:44.223
Except all the desserts I could eat,

68
00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:46.290
that was my perk, desserts.

69
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.726
But no, I didn't last, I lasted a day as a gardener.

70
00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:52.893
I got fired as a typesetter, the one skill I had

71
00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:55.203
was typesetting I'd learned at Dharma Press,

72
00:02:55.203 --> 00:02:58.001
the Tibetan Center Press, I'd learned how to typeset.

73
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.703
And so I got a job as a typesetter

74
00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:03.072
but then I got fired for not showing up on time.

75
00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:07.047
I'm not a morning person, I never was.

76
00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:10.097
I don't do mornings very well.

77
00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:12.372
I just got up for you, I probably look like I just got up,

78
00:03:12.372 --> 00:03:14.752
and it's noon, right, so.

79
00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:18.011
<v Voiceover>What's interesting, I'm hearing a theme here.</v>

80
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.990
First of all you say I was blessed with knowing

81
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.523
to do what I loved, but everything

82
00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:24.062
you tried to do that you loved seemed to fall apart on you.

83
00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:25.525
<v ->Right. Exactly.</v>

84
00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.834
So I had a very important teaching

85
00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.599
which has served me well over the years,

86
00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.398
I knew it was important to do what I loved.

87
00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:34.175
What I didn't have was how to make it work

88
00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.707
financially at all.

89
00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:38.575
I woke up 30 in a total state of shock

90
00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:39.806
the day I turned 30.

91
00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:42.845
Realized I wasn't a kid anymore.

92
00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.011
Somehow it was cool to be a poverty case in my 20s.

93
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:50.191
But at 30, that's this voice said you are 30,

94
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:52.409
you're not a kid anymore.

95
00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.789
It's time to look at your life.

96
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.726
And I spent most of the day pacing back and forth.

97
00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:01.124
I had a little one room slum apartment in Oakland,

98
00:04:01.124 --> 00:04:03.133
65 bucks a month rent.

99
00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.339
<v Voiceover>Which you usually had a hard time</v>

100
00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.205
scrounging up.

101
00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:08.108
<v ->Right, scrounging, that's a word we used all the time,</v>

102
00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:10.200
scrounging, I gotta scrounge up another

103
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.860
20 bucks for rent here.

104
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.205
I remember thinking it was almost magical

105
00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:17.909
how every month I would just get my 65 bucks together.

106
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.078
Every month, because that's what I was visualizing,

107
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.947
I need 65 bucks.

108
00:04:22.947 --> 00:04:26.393
My friend Shakti Gawain, she remembers me

109
00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:28.120
sitting up in the morning saying

110
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.231
how can I get a buck and a quarter together for a latte?

111
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:35.028
And that was my visualization for the morning.

112
00:04:35.028 --> 00:04:36.827
I need a buck and a quarter.

113
00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:38.867
<v Voiceover>So you were manifesting exactly what you</v>

114
00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:40.025
wanted and needed.

115
00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:41.732
<v ->Yes, I was, I was manifesting</v>

116
00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:44.945
exactly what I wanted and needed, yes, it's true.

117
00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:48.677
And then at age 30 I decided to raise the bar a little bit.

118
00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Voiceover>A little. (laughs)</v>

119
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.948
I paced up and down and I remembered,

120
00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:56.046
I'd also had a disastrous back to the land experiment

121
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.390
when I was about 22 that lasted six months.

122
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.085
I don't know what we were doing,

123
00:05:01.085 --> 00:05:04.797
we moved up to southwest Oregon in September

124
00:05:04.797 --> 00:05:08.060
with no buildings on the land or anything.

125
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.299
And winter hit and it was the coldest, wettest,

126
00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:14.062
worst winter of my life.

127
00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:17.376
We finally, I gave up on that.

128
00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:20.139
But I remember the day I turned 30

129
00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.717
that one night during that back to the land experiment

130
00:05:22.717 --> 00:05:24.377
we were sitting around a fire

131
00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:27.581
and this couple, we had kind of a strange couple there

132
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:31.018
who used to teach church camp.

133
00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:32.620
They went to church camp every year,

134
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.323
they were real active in their church.

135
00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:37.528
And they said, let's play this game we play at church camp.

136
00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:39.664
Let's imagine fie years have passed

137
00:05:39.664 --> 00:05:42.102
and everything has gone as well as you could imagine,

138
00:05:42.102 --> 00:05:43.925
what would your life look like?

139
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:45.933
And we went around the circle,

140
00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:48.035
sitting around a fire outside,

141
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.544
and everybody spoke.

142
00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:51.541
I don't remember a word of what I said.

143
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:55.430
So it obviously had not impact whatsoever in my life.

144
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.144
But the day I turned 30 I remembered that.

145
00:05:58.144 --> 00:06:01.709
And I thought, this is a good exercise to do,

146
00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:03.322
this is what I should do.

147
00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:05.293
But this time I took a sheet of paper

148
00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:07.928
and I wrote, Ideal Scene, at the top.

149
00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:12.166
And I dared to imagine my ideal life.

150
00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.426
As soon as I started doubts and fears

151
00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:15.866
just started assaulting me.

152
00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:17.456
Oh that's way too much Marc.

153
00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:19.836
You? Dreaming all these things?

154
00:06:19.836 --> 00:06:21.833
But I was amazed what spilled out,

155
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.768
it was I have a successful publishing company.

156
00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:29.548
I had no money, I had no family support financially.

157
00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:31.704
I was a total poverty case.

158
00:06:31.704 --> 00:06:33.339
I'd had no interest in business,

159
00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.254
I knew nothing about business.

160
00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.583
A friend reminded me a while ago,

161
00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:41.463
he remembered me walking along a beach saying to him,

162
00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:43.285
I don't know a thing about business.

163
00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:45.050
What do banks do anyway?

164
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.128
I had no idea what a bank did.

165
00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:49.160
How they could build all these big buildings

166
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.331
and how they made money, I had no idea.

167
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.707
And it wasn't until I decided, okay,

168
00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:56.322
I'd start a publishing company.

169
00:06:56.322 --> 00:06:58.109
<v Voiceover>Which just came out of nowhere, right?</v>

170
00:06:58.109 --> 00:06:59.388
<v ->Out of nowhere, I was amazed.</v>

171
00:06:59.388 --> 00:07:01.377
<v Voiceover>It's like, where did that even bubble up from</v>

172
00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:02.579
into your consciousness?

173
00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:04.715
<v ->Yeah, I don't know exactly.</v>

174
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:06.210
I'd worked some at Dharma Press,

175
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.288
I was at a Tibetan center in Berkeley.

176
00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:12.526
So I saw what a publishing company was.

177
00:07:12.526 --> 00:07:14.659
Otherwise I wouldn't have even known

178
00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.894
what it was or what they did.

179
00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:20.594
But I had this, when I dared dream my ideal

180
00:07:20.594 --> 00:07:22.562
I had this immediate picture of

181
00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:25.940
I want to write books, I'd never written a book.

182
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.704
But I don't want to be in the powerless position

183
00:07:28.704 --> 00:07:30.375
of going to all these publishers saying

184
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:32.245
please publish my book and have them say

185
00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:33.673
they want to change it and edit it.

186
00:07:33.673 --> 00:07:35.077
I didn't want that.

187
00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:37.881
I knew my dream, when I dared dream my ideal,

188
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:40.354
was I had this company that would publish

189
00:07:40.354 --> 00:07:43.419
whatever I wrote and publish all my friends,

190
00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.571
and it cruised along smoothly, it was very successful.

191
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.387
Of course my doubts and fears said, you?

192
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.430
Look, everything you've touched has fallen apart.

193
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.497
You've been a complete failure

194
00:07:54.497 --> 00:07:56.993
repeatedly at everything you've attempted.

195
00:07:56.993 --> 00:07:59.129
Those were my doubts and fears.

196
00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:03.042
But I dared dream my ideal and I wrote it down.

197
00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.472
And I thought it through and I even put

198
00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.874
what has become maybe my unique contribution to humanity,

199
00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:13.682
I put not only do I have success as a writer,

200
00:08:13.682 --> 00:08:17.513
as a musician, creating a beautiful company

201
00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:19.820
and having a big white house on a hill

202
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.353
in Marin County,

203
00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:23.629
I had a little slum apartment in Oakland,

204
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:26.763
not only do I have all that but I also have a life of ease,

205
00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:28.095
I don't work too hard.

206
00:08:28.095 --> 00:08:31.366
I love musician's hours and actor's hours.

207
00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:34.765
We never started a thing til one in the afternoon.

208
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.408
And we usually were late for that so,

209
00:08:37.408 --> 00:08:40.613
1:30 or 2 you'd get going, you know.

210
00:08:40.613 --> 00:08:43.713
That works with my biorhythm for sure.

211
00:08:43.713 --> 00:08:48.238
So that's what I wanted, a life of ease and success.

212
00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:51.981
My doubts and fears said absolutely impossible.

213
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:53.452
It's never been done, you've gotta work

214
00:08:53.452 --> 00:08:54.792
60 to 80 hours a week.

215
00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:58.366
I had these, I was assaulted by doubts and fears.

216
00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:02.601
But I paced up and down and one way I got around them,

217
00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:05.300
I remembered hearing about Buckminster Fuller.

218
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.004
People had told me he used to lecture in the 60s and 70s,

219
00:09:09.004 --> 00:09:12.870
and he looked at his life as an experiment, he said.

220
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.917
He decided, he said when he was in his 20s

221
00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:17.446
he came to a point where he decided

222
00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:19.835
to either commit suicide or look at his life

223
00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:21.785
as this unique experiment.

224
00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:23.689
And fortunately he chose the experiment.

225
00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:25.059
<v Voiceover>Fortunately for all of us.</v>

226
00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:25.823
<v ->For all of us.</v>

227
00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:27.930
It really helped me out, it was critical.

228
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.961
Because I just grabbed hold of that word,

229
00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:33.166
and i said to my doubts and fears, let me experiment.

230
00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:36.498
Let me go for my dream but in my own lazy way.

231
00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:38.866
Meaning, I work when I feel like it,

232
00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:40.663
which is afternoons and evenings.

233
00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.368
I don't do mornings, I don't do Mondays.

234
00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:46.131
Mondays is a moon day, people are emotional,

235
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:48.148
that's the worst day to start a work week.

236
00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:49.875
<v Voiceover>But did you work Saturday Sunday?</v>

237
00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.275
<v ->Sometimes. Never Sunday, no.</v>

238
00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:55.688
Sunday was always just rest, day of rest.

239
00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:58.324
<v Voiceover>So mostly it was a Tuesday through Friday,</v>

240
00:09:58.324 --> 00:09:59.923
maybe Saturday, sometimes.

241
00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:01.124
<v ->Tuesday through Friday, yeah.</v>

242
00:10:01.124 --> 00:10:03.057
In fact, what evolved over the years,

243
00:10:03.057 --> 00:10:05.632
I just do Tuesday through Friday afternoon.

244
00:10:05.632 --> 00:10:08.256
And Friday's even kind of a swing day

245
00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:10.299
where I sometimes take off.

246
00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:14.275
And then Saturday I often write or do something else.

247
00:10:14.275 --> 00:10:18.673
But I never do anything on Sunday

248
00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:20.341
except family stuff.

249
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:23.209
And Monday is my day, I never have any plans.

250
00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:24.811
It's my day alone.

251
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:26.587
It's my favorite day of the week.

252
00:10:26.587 --> 00:10:28.886
I wake up with nothing to do.

253
00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:30.651
So some days I do a lot

254
00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:32.056
when the energy's there.

255
00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:35.051
Other Mondays I just sleep all day

256
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:38.952
or relax, or hang out with my cats, or...

257
00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:42.029
<v Voiceover>So cut to, from your 30th birthday,</v>

258
00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:44.299
just really briefly here because then we have to go back

259
00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:45.901
to a few decades later.

260
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:47.898
Well, and it didn't take that long.

261
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:48.734
<v ->No.</v>

262
00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:50.237
<v Voiceover>You were living your dream.</v>

263
00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:52.776
<v ->Right. It took five years</v>

264
00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:55.040
because I didn't know what I was doing,

265
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.651
but it took five years for me to hit my financial low

266
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:01.484
where I was 65 thousand in credit card debt.

267
00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:03.457
<v Voiceover>Worse off than you're not scrounging up</v>

268
00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:04.682
65 dollars a month.

269
00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:05.553
<v ->It was way worse, yes.</v>

270
00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:07.419
Oh that's how I got around my doubts and fears,

271
00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:10.458
I said to them let me look at it at as an experiment

272
00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:13.287
to go for my dreams but do it in my own lazy way.

273
00:11:13.287 --> 00:11:16.132
And my doubts and fears said impossible,

274
00:11:16.132 --> 00:11:18.129
and I said, look, if it doesn't work

275
00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.207
I'll be no worse off than I am right now.

276
00:11:20.207 --> 00:11:22.239
I was totally broke.

277
00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:24.500
And they had to agree, well yeah,

278
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.337
it couldn't get much worse.

279
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:28.345
Well I found out it could get worse.

280
00:11:28.345 --> 00:11:31.352
In five years I was 65 thousand in credit card debt

281
00:11:31.352 --> 00:11:33.988
and my company was on the verge of bankruptcy.

282
00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:37.015
Our distributor that we had been

283
00:11:37.015 --> 00:11:39.651
one of the fore founders of, collapsed

284
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:42.089
and didn't pay us for six months of sales.

285
00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:43.366
<v Voiceover>That's a hit.</v>

286
00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.546
<v ->That's a hit, that's a really bad hit.</v>

287
00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:48.924
And we were virtually just hanging in there

288
00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:51.960
just because we had a little bit of direct mail going.

289
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.538
And it was just enough to pay the rent

290
00:11:54.538 --> 00:11:56.407
and it was just marginal.

291
00:11:56.407 --> 00:12:00.540
And personally I was 65 thousand in credit card debt

292
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.348
and this was the early 80s,

293
00:12:02.348 --> 00:12:03.880
so that's a lot more money.

294
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.852
Maybe 150 thousand in today's dollars

295
00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:08.220
or something, I was thinking.

296
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.724
And that's when I hit my financail low.

297
00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:14.695
And then, actually it was one phrase I heard

298
00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:17.896
that turned my life around, driving into work

299
00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:21.124
I heard on the radio, thank God for PBS radio,

300
00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:24.766
and for Conscious Media now and Internet and all that,

301
00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:29.210
but on a PBS station they quoted Napoleon Hill saying

302
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.840
within every adversity is an equal or greater benefit.

303
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.650
And it was like a light bulb went off.

304
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.611
It was, just this inner voice said

305
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:41.780
I've got to remember this, this is the peace I need,

306
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.951
I've been so overwhelmed with problems.

307
00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:46.494
And I pulled over on the shoulder of the freeway

308
00:12:46.494 --> 00:12:48.526
and wrote it down because I knew I'd forget it.

309
00:12:48.526 --> 00:12:51.823
I wrote it down and then I put it in big letters

310
00:12:51.823 --> 00:12:53.828
above my phone in my office.

311
00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:55.999
And then I put it in my words, I said

312
00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:58.600
within every problem is an opportunity.

313
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.336
And then later on I added a phrase

314
00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:02.610
from Bhagavad Gita

315
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.735
that we did a version of.

316
00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:06.499
So there's nothing new in this,

317
00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:08.810
this was written five thousand years ago.

318
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.744
The phrase was, even in the knocks of life

319
00:13:11.744 --> 00:13:13.610
we can find great gifts.

320
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.488
And I literally started, I would just ponder that,

321
00:13:17.488 --> 00:13:18.718
ponder that.

322
00:13:18.718 --> 00:13:20.518
People would keep coming into my office,

323
00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:21.992
we've got another problem.

324
00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:24.253
We still haven't got a check from the distributor.

325
00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:26.729
More problems came up.

326
00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:28.865
And I would acknowledge the problem,

327
00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:30.696
we'd get the problems right away.

328
00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:34.005
But then I literally started asking myself okay,

329
00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:35.898
what opportunities are here?

330
00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:39.346
What benefits? What gifts?

331
00:13:39.346 --> 00:13:43.212
And I would just listen for answers.

332
00:13:43.212 --> 00:13:45.987
And I found I'd get answers.

333
00:13:45.987 --> 00:13:48.622
And each of those three things are a little bit different.

334
00:13:48.622 --> 00:13:50.387
What opportunities are here?

335
00:13:50.387 --> 00:13:53.858
What benefits? What benefits can there possibly be

336
00:13:53.858 --> 00:13:55.927
in almost being bankrupt?

337
00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:59.921
Okay, I pondered that, and I got some answers.

338
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:03.699
I realized I'd been seeing myself

339
00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:06.434
as the space cased artist that really didn't know

340
00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:08.567
what he was doing and was waiting for

341
00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:10.471
a big daddy to come along

342
00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:12.665
and show me how to run my company.

343
00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:15.707
And big daddy or big mama had not come along.

344
00:14:15.707 --> 00:14:18.343
And I realized it's up to me

345
00:14:18.343 --> 00:14:20.711
to take responsibility for this.

346
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:23.416
We were all pointing our fingers at other people

347
00:14:23.416 --> 00:14:24.751
with all these problems.

348
00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:27.352
It was never our fault, it was always the distributor

349
00:14:27.352 --> 00:14:28.490
or this or that.

350
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.929
No, it was my fault.

351
00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:32.925
Bankruptcy is the fault of the top management

352
00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:34.698
and I was top management.

353
00:14:34.698 --> 00:14:36.532
You know, I tried to bring in other people

354
00:14:36.532 --> 00:14:39.493
to take over top management but it had not worked.

355
00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.502
So I got, okay, the benefit is

356
00:14:42.502 --> 00:14:45.811
I need to take responsibility, the buck stops here,

357
00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:48.609
I'm going to make this work, how do I make this work?

358
00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:50.746
As soon as I said that I got answers.

359
00:14:50.746 --> 00:14:52.684
Well, you need another distributor,

360
00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:55.273
give up on this distributor, they're going bankrupt.

361
00:14:55.273 --> 00:14:56.353
Duh.

362
00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:58.652
And the steps were very simple to take.

363
00:14:58.652 --> 00:15:00.483
Within a year I was profitable.

364
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.853
I was debt free.

365
00:15:01.853 --> 00:15:03.409
The company was cruising along

366
00:15:03.409 --> 00:15:06.367
just like my dream and visualization.

367
00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:09.060
<v Voiceover>Because you had dared to ask a question</v>

368
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.994
that people normally, because fear is running the show

369
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.270
by that point, would not stop to ask themselves.

370
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.103
And your mind was alert to look for the clues

371
00:15:17.103 --> 00:15:18.542
and guidance to that.

372
00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.760
So there was still something very flexible

373
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.710
about your spirit and your mind

374
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.079
that even allowed you to ask those questions.

375
00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.657
<v ->Yes, you could say that, right.</v>

376
00:15:27.657 --> 00:15:29.584
And you nailed it, fear.

377
00:15:29.584 --> 00:15:34.454
Fear is the root of all the problems.

378
00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:37.827
And love is the solution to all the problems.

379
00:15:37.827 --> 00:15:41.286
When you really do what you love to do

380
00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:44.572
and go for it and find what excites you and what works,

381
00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:46.171
it starts working.

382
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:48.559
And that love overcomes all those fears.

383
00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:50.545
<v Voiceover>Now you've written a couple books on the</v>

384
00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:53.142
subject, you have done interviews like this,

385
00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:55.174
and you've talked to many.

386
00:15:55.174 --> 00:15:58.041
So let's start dissecting a little bit

387
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.783
of what you found some of the really,

388
00:15:59.783 --> 00:16:03.684
just kind of, key must dos are in this process.

389
00:16:03.684 --> 00:16:06.258
If you're lucky enough to love something

390
00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:08.847
and have a passion for it, which again,

391
00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:10.426
because of fear, a lot of people haven't even

392
00:16:10.426 --> 00:16:12.260
identified what they love.

393
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.666
Can you talk about that?

394
00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:15.663
Just the first part about really getting to the point

395
00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:17.161
where you can identify your passion

396
00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:18.528
and what you really want.

397
00:16:18.528 --> 00:16:21.773
<v ->Yeah, I think there's just two key steps.</v>

398
00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:25.006
The older I get the more simple I can put it,

399
00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:27.073
the simpler I see things.

400
00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:28.942
I think there's just two key steps.

401
00:16:28.942 --> 00:16:31.041
The first is identifying what you love,

402
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:34.013
really finding out what you love to do,

403
00:16:34.013 --> 00:16:35.383
what you want to do.

404
00:16:35.383 --> 00:16:39.049
Oprah said if you don't know what you want to do,

405
00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:41.824
the most important work you can do is to find out.

406
00:16:41.824 --> 00:16:42.961
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

407
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.663
<v ->Oprah's become a wonderful teacher, definitely.</v>

408
00:16:45.663 --> 00:16:47.997
But that is, that's the critical thing.

409
00:16:47.997 --> 00:16:51.860
Find out what expands your heart,

410
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.566
what you love.

411
00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:56.538
It's a feeling thing totally.

412
00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:58.443
What excites you?

413
00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:01.609
What makes your eyes shine?

414
00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:04.546
<v Voiceover>What makes time stand still for you</v>

415
00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:05.951
when you're doing it?

416
00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:06.819
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

417
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.848
<v Voiceover>Okay, let's take that for a moment and take</v>

418
00:17:08.848 --> 00:17:11.155
someone that's watching right now that might feel

419
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.149
a little stuck, maybe their job has gone away.

420
00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:15.355
You know because we're in a recession at the moment.

421
00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:18.432
And so you're overwhelmed with fear

422
00:17:18.432 --> 00:17:22.867
and you have to work around through that

423
00:17:22.867 --> 00:17:25.267
mechanism of fear that people are experiencing

424
00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:28.472
to have the clear enough space to do that.

425
00:17:28.472 --> 00:17:30.376
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

426
00:17:30.376 --> 00:17:33.847
But you can do what a therapist once called

427
00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:36.781
lowering the gradient, you can lower the gradient.

428
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:41.121
The ideal to me is to do what you love

429
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.211
all the time, every moment.

430
00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:46.473
I, early on, when things started working,

431
00:17:46.473 --> 00:17:50.719
that was my guiding thing, do I love this moment?

432
00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:51.993
Do I love this project?

433
00:17:51.993 --> 00:17:54.196
Sometimes I love a project for a while

434
00:17:54.196 --> 00:17:56.297
and then something happens and it's no fun anymore

435
00:17:56.297 --> 00:17:57.737
so I just let it go.

436
00:17:57.737 --> 00:18:00.303
That's the ideal, to do what you love every moment.

437
00:18:00.303 --> 00:18:03.136
Okay, maybe you're very far from that ideal.

438
00:18:03.136 --> 00:18:05.539
Maybe you just lost a job and have a mortgage

439
00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:08.546
or rent and a family and all these obligations.

440
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:12.319
Okay, you need to take care of yourself

441
00:18:12.319 --> 00:18:14.606
and fulfill those obligations.

442
00:18:14.606 --> 00:18:16.313
It might even mean working in a job

443
00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:17.958
you don't particularly like.

444
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.419
When I first started the company,

445
00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:22.521
I knew nothing about financing or anything,

446
00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:24.646
I had no money, so I said okay,

447
00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.248
I've got to get some kind of job

448
00:18:26.248 --> 00:18:29.963
and save 20 percent and put in to my company.

449
00:18:29.963 --> 00:18:32.769
That was my first plan, which is not a bad plan.

450
00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:35.962
I got a perfectly awful 40 hour a week job,

451
00:18:35.962 --> 00:18:37.538
which I think is an inhumane amount

452
00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:39.280
of time to work any job.

453
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.336
<v Voiceover>I would agree.</v>

454
00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:41.909
<v ->I know, even things I love I don't love to do</v>

455
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:43.740
40 hours a week, whatever.

456
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.887
But I got a 40 hour a week job typesetting

457
00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:49.545
and I started saving some money

458
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.449
and did my first few little projects

459
00:18:51.449 --> 00:18:53.586
and that's how it started working.

460
00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:56.128
So at first you might have to do something

461
00:18:56.128 --> 00:19:00.487
that is not ideal, but at least covers the rent

462
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:02.260
and covers the basics.

463
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.337
But then you keep focused on that ideal

464
00:19:05.337 --> 00:19:07.926
and you find even an hour a week

465
00:19:07.926 --> 00:19:09.400
to lower the gradient.

466
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.512
Okay, find an hour a week., find two hours a week

467
00:19:12.512 --> 00:19:14.207
to do what you love.

468
00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:16.540
What do you love to do?

469
00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.844
I heard of this Canadian writer

470
00:19:18.844 --> 00:19:20.447
and I forget which one it was,

471
00:19:20.447 --> 00:19:22.153
maybe Anne Beattie or something,

472
00:19:22.153 --> 00:19:24.290
but she had four or five kids

473
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.285
and was just totally busy and overwhelmed.

474
00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:29.386
But she decided to write longhand

475
00:19:29.386 --> 00:19:31.325
two pages a day of her novel.

476
00:19:31.325 --> 00:19:33.659
And if she couldn't find time during the day

477
00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:35.400
she did it in bed.

478
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.094
Just before going to bed she'd write her two pages.

479
00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.495
Well you write two pages a day, that adds up.

480
00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:42.865
<v Voiceover>Sure does.</v>

481
00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:45.846
<v ->And she wrote her first novel and it did well.</v>

482
00:19:45.846 --> 00:19:48.110
<v Voiceover>And you're right, this gradient,</v>

483
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.071
this baby step commitment is right,

484
00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:52.510
Rome wasn't built in a day.

485
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.439
<v ->Right.</v>

486
00:19:53.439 --> 00:19:57.581
<v Voiceover>We are in such an impatient culture in general</v>

487
00:19:57.581 --> 00:20:01.456
that people are so attune now to instant gratification

488
00:20:01.456 --> 00:20:03.464
that maybe this is the part of ourselves

489
00:20:03.464 --> 00:20:04.794
we have to roll back

490
00:20:04.794 --> 00:20:07.081
and start to have trust and faith again

491
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:09.798
in the fact, it doesn't matter if you're trying to

492
00:20:09.798 --> 00:20:11.237
write the great American novel,

493
00:20:11.237 --> 00:20:13.571
whether you're trying to lose weight, make more money,

494
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:14.709
it doesn't really matter.

495
00:20:14.709 --> 00:20:17.100
It does start with those little baby steps, doesn't it?

496
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.772
<v ->Right, and it's all baby steps</v>

497
00:20:18.772 --> 00:20:20.572
every little step of the way.

498
00:20:20.572 --> 00:20:23.012
So it's daring to dream

499
00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:25.009
and make a plan.

500
00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:28.040
And the plan can be at first just baby steps.

501
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.617
I'm going to find two hours a week

502
00:20:30.617 --> 00:20:32.823
to focus on doing my dream.

503
00:20:32.823 --> 00:20:34.785
Two hours a week, I'll find it.

504
00:20:34.785 --> 00:20:36.656
And you can do that.

505
00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:38.722
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's true.</v>

506
00:20:38.722 --> 00:20:40.414
I mean there's no excuse when you're talking

507
00:20:40.414 --> 00:20:42.826
an hour, two hours a week, to not do it.

508
00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.869
<v ->Right. There's no excuse.</v>

509
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.599
<v Voiceover>So now you have no excuse,</v>

510
00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:50.544
again because, I think it's really important to look

511
00:20:50.544 --> 00:20:52.938
almost mechanistically at how our minds

512
00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:54.540
and our emotions work.

513
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.943
You're programmed, we're programmed,

514
00:20:56.943 --> 00:20:58.685
all of humanity is programmed

515
00:20:58.685 --> 00:21:01.042
with a good dollop of fear every day

516
00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:02.446
of some kind or another.

517
00:21:02.446 --> 00:21:04.277
Something's going down and, you know,

518
00:21:04.277 --> 00:21:05.923
watch out or you're going to get cancer

519
00:21:05.923 --> 00:21:07.223
and so on and so forth.

520
00:21:07.223 --> 00:21:11.298
So you, from a mechanistic model,

521
00:21:11.298 --> 00:21:12.993
you have a subconscious mind

522
00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:15.931
and even a mind filled with this negative programming.

523
00:21:15.931 --> 00:21:19.832
You have to override it so to speak

524
00:21:19.832 --> 00:21:24.273
through constant positive focus.

525
00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:27.138
<v ->Yeah, I used to think you had to</v>

526
00:21:27.138 --> 00:21:30.342
have a positive focus 51 percent of the time.

527
00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:32.652
I wrote a book, A Visionary Life,

528
00:21:32.652 --> 00:21:34.986
and even put that in there.

529
00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:38.515
Then I heard the wonderful analogy of a plane.

530
00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:41.824
It's not an analogy, it's reality.

531
00:21:41.824 --> 00:21:46.389
A plane is off course 95 percent of it's time or more,

532
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:49.768
but the pilot keeps correcting over and over and over.

533
00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:53.100
When I heard that I said, yes that's the story of my life.

534
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.301
You can be off course, you can be in fear even,

535
00:21:56.301 --> 00:21:59.192
95 percent of the time or more.

536
00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:02.707
But if you keep getting back,

537
00:22:02.707 --> 00:22:05.249
you keep correcting, you keep remembering your dream

538
00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:08.616
and taking whatever little baby steps you can

539
00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:12.053
this week toward it, you get back on course.

540
00:22:12.053 --> 00:22:14.218
You get off course again right away,

541
00:22:14.218 --> 00:22:16.029
oh more fear, oh this is so hard,

542
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:19.524
oh life is a struggle, it's so hard to succeed.

543
00:22:19.524 --> 00:22:20.964
Okay, you're off course.

544
00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.217
Then you get back on.

545
00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:25.004
No, I have this dream, I'm going for it,

546
00:22:25.004 --> 00:22:26.896
I'm going to do this thing

547
00:22:26.896 --> 00:22:30.333
and I'm putting an hour a week in toward this.

548
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:32.707
I'm taking this step, you're back on course.

549
00:22:32.707 --> 00:22:35.272
So you can be off course most of the time.

550
00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:37.432
You can be fearful most of the time.

551
00:22:37.432 --> 00:22:39.382
You can be totally neurotic.

552
00:22:39.382 --> 00:22:43.353
I had this sort of epiphany seeing Ross Perot on TV

553
00:22:43.353 --> 00:22:45.915
one time, the first time I ever saw him.

554
00:22:45.915 --> 00:22:49.956
I thought, he's a billionaire and the man is wacko.

555
00:22:50.746 --> 00:22:53.924
And I realized now that I've met a lot of rich people,

556
00:22:53.924 --> 00:22:55.758
rich people are just as neurotic.

557
00:22:55.758 --> 00:22:59.706
And many are just as fearful as poor people.

558
00:23:01.156 --> 00:23:03.601
They just have one thing going,

559
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:06.108
they dare to dream something and go for it.

560
00:23:06.108 --> 00:23:09.278
You know, they have just as many fears and anxieties

561
00:23:09.278 --> 00:23:12.877
and problems, but they have that piece of it,

562
00:23:12.877 --> 00:23:15.349
that they keep moving toward a goal,

563
00:23:15.349 --> 00:23:17.253
they keep focused on a goal

564
00:23:17.253 --> 00:23:20.887
and at some point that dream

565
00:23:20.887 --> 00:23:24.323
gets to become even an intention.

566
00:23:24.323 --> 00:23:26.924
I am going to do this.

567
00:23:26.924 --> 00:23:28.700
Once it becomes an intention,

568
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.629
all the fears and anxieties in the world

569
00:23:31.629 --> 00:23:33.034
won't stop an intention.

570
00:23:33.034 --> 00:23:34.841
<v Voiceover>Now you're getting into</v>

571
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:38.139
some kind of deep cosmic soul purpose thinking now.

572
00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:42.040
There has to be then embedded in that seed of that passion,

573
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.443
that love for what you want to do,

574
00:23:44.443 --> 00:23:46.614
something that is far more powerful

575
00:23:46.614 --> 00:23:48.414
than the force of fear.

576
00:23:48.414 --> 00:23:51.014
<v ->Yes, yes, ultimately</v>

577
00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:54.091
our love is far more powerful than fear.

578
00:23:54.091 --> 00:23:55.728
It literally is.

579
00:23:55.728 --> 00:23:57.423
It's higher in our bodies,

580
00:23:57.423 --> 00:24:00.523
our fear is centered low, real low.

581
00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:03.866
I mean in worst cases of extreme fear

582
00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:06.699
you can lose control of your sphincter muscle.

583
00:24:06.699 --> 00:24:09.428
That's where fear is centered, down low.

584
00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:12.368
Where love is in your heart, it's higher.

585
00:24:12.368 --> 00:24:14.214
Love transcends fear.

586
00:24:14.214 --> 00:24:16.640
And if you really do what you love to do,

587
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.168
if you dare to dream, it always does involve love

588
00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:24.424
and in some ways serving others.

589
00:24:24.424 --> 00:24:27.718
I do think the greatest key, at least for me

590
00:24:27.718 --> 00:24:30.191
in my words, to the greatest secret of all,

591
00:24:30.191 --> 00:24:34.025
I think is to love and serve yourself and others.

592
00:24:34.915 --> 00:24:38.400
And keep that in mind, that will overcome fears.

593
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.298
When the fears arise, they're petty, they're self centered,

594
00:24:42.298 --> 00:24:47.003
they're limiting, it's this little limited little me.

595
00:24:47.003 --> 00:24:49.907
Eckhart Tolle keeps talking about the little me.

596
00:24:49.907 --> 00:24:53.912
It's the little me saying, oh this is hard,

597
00:24:53.912 --> 00:24:56.254
this is hard, life is hard,

598
00:24:56.254 --> 00:24:57.891
you know, life is a struggle.

599
00:24:57.891 --> 00:24:59.249
It's so hard to make money,

600
00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:00.791
it's so hard to succeed.

601
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.021
That's the little me.

602
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:04.030
We're far greater than that.

603
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.188
We're far greater, more creative people.

604
00:25:07.188 --> 00:25:10.764
We have just as much potential as anybody else.

605
00:25:10.764 --> 00:25:14.874
We all have this amazing, amazing physical body,

606
00:25:14.874 --> 00:25:19.076
this phenomenal brain, and this incredible connection

607
00:25:19.076 --> 00:25:22.545
to some vast subconscious or whatever you want to call it.

608
00:25:22.545 --> 00:25:25.111
Some people even just call it the universe.

609
00:25:25.111 --> 00:25:28.722
We have this great, deep connection

610
00:25:28.722 --> 00:25:31.821
that we can even

611
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:34.085
summon into our lives.

612
00:25:34.085 --> 00:25:37.231
We can summon great power into our life

613
00:25:37.231 --> 00:25:39.030
by doing what we love.

614
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.862
<v Voiceover>And you took a few practical steps</v>

615
00:25:42.862 --> 00:25:43.764
along the way.

616
00:25:43.764 --> 00:25:46.661
One you decided, okay, I have to take responsibility,

617
00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:48.972
I'm the boss I've been waiting for in my company

618
00:25:48.972 --> 00:25:51.055
which is failing right now. (laughs)

619
00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:52.501
<v ->Right, right, yes yes, right.</v>

620
00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:54.311
<v Voiceover>You became the boss, you started turning</v>

621
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:57.110
it around, even within a year you started turning it around.

622
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.816
And there were a few little kind of,

623
00:25:58.816 --> 00:26:01.545
I won't call them tricks, but tools that you use

624
00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:04.981
to be able to repattern this in yourself

625
00:26:04.981 --> 00:26:07.559
that you write about in The Greatest Secret of All.

626
00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:09.576
Can you share just a couple of these little

627
00:26:09.576 --> 00:26:12.293
functional things that you have people work with,

628
00:26:12.293 --> 00:26:13.253
that you work with.

629
00:26:13.253 --> 00:26:14.980
<v ->Yeah, to me,</v>

630
00:26:15.832 --> 00:26:18.129
maybe the most powerful thing of all

631
00:26:18.129 --> 00:26:20.938
is finding the right affirmation in the moment.

632
00:26:20.938 --> 00:26:23.199
Or just finding something in the moment

633
00:26:23.199 --> 00:26:25.173
that gets you back on course.

634
00:26:26.503 --> 00:26:29.415
Fortunately I wandered into this seminar when I was 28

635
00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.714
led by this man named Ken Keyes, Jr.

636
00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:33.177
who had written a book called

637
00:26:33.177 --> 00:26:35.914
Handbook to Higher Consciousness in the 70s.

638
00:26:35.914 --> 00:26:40.326
He understood something about our deep core beliefs

639
00:26:40.326 --> 00:26:43.794
and that's the piece of the pie that he really knew

640
00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:45.427
and could teach.

641
00:26:45.427 --> 00:26:49.398
And he taught us the core belief process he called it.

642
00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:52.161
And what it boils down to is

643
00:26:52.161 --> 00:26:55.238
realizing that all these beliefs

644
00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:58.477
that we've accepted as true in our lives,

645
00:26:58.477 --> 00:27:00.636
and certainly seem true in our lives,

646
00:27:00.636 --> 00:27:03.977
because we see them every day in our loves, they become...

647
00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:05.544
<v Voiceover>You see evidence.</v>

648
00:27:05.544 --> 00:27:06.920
<v ->We see evidence in our lives.</v>

649
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.456
If you're struggling to pay the rent,

650
00:27:09.456 --> 00:27:12.683
well it's true, it's hard to pay the rent, it's a struggle.

651
00:27:12.683 --> 00:27:15.220
Yes, well, life is a struggle, it's hard.

652
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.287
He showed us these beliefs are not

653
00:27:17.287 --> 00:27:19.223
necessarily true in themselves.

654
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:22.932
There are many people with very different sets of beliefs.

655
00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:25.932
So the beliefs are not true in themselves.

656
00:27:25.932 --> 00:27:28.104
But they become true in our experience

657
00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:29.508
if we believe them.

658
00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:33.374
So it's very good to look at all our beliefs.

659
00:27:33.374 --> 00:27:37.849
Look, how do we really think the world is?

660
00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:39.715
Is the world a struggle?

661
00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:43.605
Is the world some place that's limited in some way,

662
00:27:43.605 --> 00:27:47.044
or scarcity? Is there scarcity in the world?

663
00:27:47.044 --> 00:27:49.052
Is there scarcity in our lives?

664
00:27:49.052 --> 00:27:51.522
Is it hard to succeed?

665
00:27:51.522 --> 00:27:53.693
If so, those are just beliefs.

666
00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:55.933
And we can change those beliefs.

667
00:27:55.933 --> 00:27:57.962
<v Voiceover>And you can see evidence to the contrary.</v>

668
00:27:57.962 --> 00:27:58.688
<v ->Yes.</v>

669
00:27:58.688 --> 00:27:59.539
<v Voiceover>Around.</v>

670
00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:01.164
<v ->And once we change the belief,</v>

671
00:28:01.164 --> 00:28:03.474
we see evidence to the contrary in our lives.

672
00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:06.208
So for me, when I hit my financial low,

673
00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:08.146
one of the best things I did,

674
00:28:08.146 --> 00:28:09.844
I've already said one of the best things,

675
00:28:09.844 --> 00:28:11.179
I just heard that phrase,

676
00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:14.279
within every adversity is an equal or greater benefit.

677
00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:16.212
That was key.

678
00:28:16.212 --> 00:28:20.124
The other best thing I did was the core belief process,

679
00:28:20.124 --> 00:28:23.247
I did a very effective one that changed my life.

680
00:28:23.247 --> 00:28:25.754
I was driving to the bank.

681
00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:28.367
I'd gotten another credit card sent to me.

682
00:28:28.367 --> 00:28:30.700
I had been living for years on

683
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.999
getting more credit cards, getting cash advances

684
00:28:32.999 --> 00:28:35.530
and paying down the minimums of the other cards.

685
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.039
<v Voiceover>A lot of people can relate.</v>

686
00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.069
<v ->Yeah, right.</v>

687
00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:41.866
And I realized I was, I had all this anxiety,

688
00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:43.880
my stomach was just churning

689
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.220
as I was going to the bank.

690
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.914
Oh, now I'm 65 thousand in credit card debt,

691
00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:50.921
okay, that was, I remember thinking that number,

692
00:28:50.921 --> 00:28:54.352
that was a pretty big number for me to grapple with.

693
00:28:54.352 --> 00:28:57.092
And I felt this anxiety, and then I remembered,

694
00:28:57.092 --> 00:28:59.658
oh this is the time to do the core belief process,

695
00:28:59.658 --> 00:29:01.329
when you feel anxiety.

696
00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:03.663
And I did, I went through these steps,

697
00:29:03.663 --> 00:29:08.091
all they are is asking you eight really simple questions.

698
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:10.472
The first is, what is the problem?

699
00:29:10.472 --> 00:29:12.596
That we know, we know that.

700
00:29:12.596 --> 00:29:14.570
<v Voiceover>It's almost like you have to throw a bone</v>

701
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.575
to that part of the mind that's trying to deal with,

702
00:29:16.575 --> 00:29:18.932
that's trying to create problems for yourself, right?

703
00:29:18.932 --> 00:29:20.455
Give it a bone.

704
00:29:20.455 --> 00:29:21.172
Acknowledge it.

705
00:29:21.172 --> 00:29:22.887
<v ->And really acknowledge the problem, right.</v>

706
00:29:22.887 --> 00:29:25.114
And that one we all know very quickly.

707
00:29:25.114 --> 00:29:27.389
We can say, oh it's so hard,

708
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:29.560
it's so hard to succeed, it's hard to make money.

709
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.854
For me it was, I'm almost bankrupt

710
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:34.164
because I'm just an idiot with money, that's the problem.

711
00:29:34.164 --> 00:29:36.616
Then two, it's really good to ask,

712
00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:38.857
what are you feeling physically?

713
00:29:38.857 --> 00:29:41.806
And just tune in, ah, I realized

714
00:29:41.806 --> 00:29:43.335
my neck and shoulders were uptight,

715
00:29:43.335 --> 00:29:44.903
my stomach was churning.

716
00:29:44.903 --> 00:29:47.471
Three, what are you feeling emotionally?

717
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:49.445
And just nail the emotion.

718
00:29:49.445 --> 00:29:52.712
Sometimes men especially will start going on and on and on

719
00:29:52.712 --> 00:29:55.414
getting philosophical, no, just nail the emotion.

720
00:29:55.414 --> 00:29:58.084
I feel anxiety.

721
00:29:58.084 --> 00:30:00.877
I feel there's some kind of guilt

722
00:30:00.877 --> 00:30:04.130
or sadness or, underneath it all

723
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.127
there's always fear.

724
00:30:06.127 --> 00:30:07.065
There's always fear.

725
00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:09.128
Okay, you acknowledge that fear.

726
00:30:09.128 --> 00:30:11.160
I feel this fear.

727
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.770
Then you just say,

728
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.508
what tapes have I been running

729
00:30:16.508 --> 00:30:17.945
is what we used to say, or

730
00:30:17.945 --> 00:30:19.907
what's been going through my mind?

731
00:30:19.907 --> 00:30:22.341
What am I telling myself repeatedly?

732
00:30:22.341 --> 00:30:26.080
And you just out loud spill out all those thoughts.

733
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.714
Well I'm just an idiot with money, I just can't handle it,

734
00:30:29.714 --> 00:30:30.944
it's just so hard.

735
00:30:30.944 --> 00:30:33.422
You just run all those things

736
00:30:33.422 --> 00:30:36.824
so you're consciously looking at them

737
00:30:36.824 --> 00:30:39.425
rather than being this passive victim

738
00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:41.802
of all these thoughts and feelings.

739
00:30:41.802 --> 00:30:45.772
Then, five, a very good thing to do is to say

740
00:30:45.772 --> 00:30:47.998
what's the worst that could happen?

741
00:30:47.998 --> 00:30:50.700
In this situation what's the worst thing that can happen?

742
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.869
Well, I could go bankrupt.

743
00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:56.641
Then you say, what's the very worst thing that can happen?

744
00:30:56.641 --> 00:30:59.578
So you really look at your worst fears.

745
00:30:59.578 --> 00:31:02.016
We tend to want to hide our worst fears.

746
00:31:02.016 --> 00:31:03.479
We don't want to confront them.

747
00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:04.710
We're afraid of them.

748
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.577
That little question force us to

749
00:31:07.577 --> 00:31:09.888
open all those closet doors and look,

750
00:31:09.888 --> 00:31:12.813
what are your worst deepest fears?

751
00:31:12.813 --> 00:31:14.892
What's behind all this anxiety?

752
00:31:14.892 --> 00:31:16.192
What is that fear?

753
00:31:16.192 --> 00:31:18.031
For me, what I got down to is,

754
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:23.239
well I could die painfully and slowly

755
00:31:23.239 --> 00:31:26.777
a drunken bum in a gutter somewhere

756
00:31:26.777 --> 00:31:29.305
and no one would know or care.

757
00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:30.452
I would just lay there...

758
00:31:30.452 --> 00:31:32.045
<v Voiceover>Well you got to the bottom of it.</v>

759
00:31:32.045 --> 00:31:34.082
<v ->Yes, that was somewhere at the bottom.</v>

760
00:31:34.082 --> 00:31:37.322
And it usually brings up even some chuckles

761
00:31:37.322 --> 00:31:40.093
because you realize the chance of your worst fears

762
00:31:40.093 --> 00:31:43.286
coming true are very slim.

763
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:46.020
Very very slim.

764
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.889
Very remote.

765
00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:49.967
So then you say, okay, what's the best case

766
00:31:49.967 --> 00:31:53.299
in this scenario? What's the best thing that could happen?

767
00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:58.007
I've done this, over the years, hundreds of times now

768
00:31:58.007 --> 00:31:59.609
with hundreds of people.

769
00:31:59.609 --> 00:32:03.413
Inevitably we get into our worst fears

770
00:32:03.413 --> 00:32:07.372
with incredible energy and we get into it right away.

771
00:32:07.372 --> 00:32:09.485
Then you say, okay, in this situation

772
00:32:09.485 --> 00:32:10.855
what's the best that could happen?

773
00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:14.591
And we go, huh, hmm, let me think.

774
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:16.356
And we have to think about it.

775
00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:19.966
And it shows me, yes, we've been dwelling in fear.

776
00:32:19.966 --> 00:32:21.763
We've been going through in the things

777
00:32:21.763 --> 00:32:24.898
we've been telling ourselves the fear based scenarios

778
00:32:24.898 --> 00:32:28.741
and very rarely have we even thought of

779
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:32.091
a good scenario.

780
00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:33.774
We certainly haven't thought of

781
00:32:33.774 --> 00:32:36.677
what is our ideal scene in this situation?

782
00:32:36.677 --> 00:32:39.812
Or what good things could possibly happen?

783
00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:42.110
We haven't even gone there usually.

784
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:46.720
So that question, what's your ideal scene in this situation?

785
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.687
What's the best that could happen?

786
00:32:48.687 --> 00:32:52.530
Oh, I could find a new distributor

787
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.329
and the company could make a profit

788
00:32:54.329 --> 00:32:57.731
and I could make a bonus that pays off my debt.

789
00:32:57.731 --> 00:33:00.956
That turned out to be exactly what happened.

790
00:33:00.956 --> 00:33:02.403
Exactly what happened.

791
00:33:02.403 --> 00:33:04.473
<v Voiceover>Is that the final of the eight questions then?</v>

792
00:33:04.473 --> 00:33:06.639
<v ->No, there's one more and that is,</v>

793
00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:09.007
there's actually two more, so I think that was six.

794
00:33:09.007 --> 00:33:10.934
Because then the one more is

795
00:33:10.934 --> 00:33:14.719
what's preventing that best case scenario from happening?

796
00:33:14.719 --> 00:33:16.217
Why isn't that happening?

797
00:33:16.217 --> 00:33:20.048
Whatever you answer there is your deep underlying belief.

798
00:33:20.048 --> 00:33:23.656
For me it was, well I'm a fool with money.

799
00:33:23.656 --> 00:33:25.687
I'm out of control.

800
00:33:27.017 --> 00:33:29.501
Say it in the simplest words you possibly can.

801
00:33:30.691 --> 00:33:34.295
What is preventing you from achieving that ideal scene

802
00:33:34.295 --> 00:33:35.700
in this situation?

803
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.938
Whatever comes up, that's the belief you have to replace,

804
00:33:39.938 --> 00:33:42.709
you have to delete, how do you do that?

805
00:33:42.709 --> 00:33:44.145
By the last question,

806
00:33:44.145 --> 00:33:47.385
what affirmation completely contradicts that belief

807
00:33:47.385 --> 00:33:48.987
and counteracts that belief

808
00:33:48.987 --> 00:33:50.519
and turns it right around?

809
00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:53.619
For me, I literally again, have pulled over

810
00:33:53.619 --> 00:33:55.358
on the side of the freeway when I got it

811
00:33:55.358 --> 00:33:56.995
because I was driving down the freeway

812
00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:58.423
and I was thinking, okay,

813
00:33:58.423 --> 00:34:00.997
my belief is I'm a fool and I'm out of control.

814
00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:04.794
Okay, what affirmation directly contradicts that?

815
00:34:04.794 --> 00:34:08.137
I came up with, I am sensible

816
00:34:08.137 --> 00:34:10.401
and in control of my finances.

817
00:34:10.401 --> 00:34:13.536
I'm creating total financial success.

818
00:34:13.536 --> 00:34:16.113
And I added, in an easy and relaxed manner

819
00:34:16.113 --> 00:34:18.099
in a healthy and positive way.

820
00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:20.711
And again, I pulled over and wrote that down.

821
00:34:20.711 --> 00:34:22.580
I wrote it down five times.

822
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.285
I put it up on my wall, I carried it in my pocket

823
00:34:25.285 --> 00:34:28.048
in my billfold, I put it in my bathroom

824
00:34:28.048 --> 00:34:30.428
on the mirror, I put it on my dresser,

825
00:34:30.428 --> 00:34:32.530
in my bed, I kept it in front of me.

826
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.432
And whenever those anxieties would come up again,

827
00:34:35.432 --> 00:34:38.300
whenever I thought of money anxiety would arise.

828
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.006
I'd just acknowledge the anxiety, okay,

829
00:34:42.006 --> 00:34:45.196
but then I'd start affirming, I am sensible

830
00:34:45.196 --> 00:34:47.947
and in control of my finances.

831
00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:50.676
I am creating total financial success.

832
00:34:50.676 --> 00:34:53.245
That affirmation was so powerful,

833
00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:57.250
the first time I said it I felt it through my whole body,

834
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.350
I felt like very cell of my body resonate.

835
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.554
And as I kept saying it, it finally got through

836
00:35:03.554 --> 00:35:05.992
my thick skull, oh yeah, you know,

837
00:35:05.992 --> 00:35:08.396
finances aren't that complicated.

838
00:35:08.396 --> 00:35:11.170
Money isn't that hard to master.

839
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.970
It's actually very simple.

840
00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:14.897
All you need is very simple math

841
00:35:14.897 --> 00:35:18.136
and all you need to do is make more money than you spend.

842
00:35:18.136 --> 00:35:21.306
This is not a complex thing,

843
00:35:21.306 --> 00:35:23.848
a ten year old can understand this concept.

844
00:35:23.848 --> 00:35:25.544
So even I can.

845
00:35:25.544 --> 00:35:29.119
And I affirmed that, I got that affirmation

846
00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:31.650
and that's what turned around the whole thing.

847
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:35.087
That affirmation and looking at the benefits

848
00:35:35.087 --> 00:35:37.330
and opportunities.

849
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.490
<v Voiceover>And you could feel it, I mean, it shifted you</v>

850
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.331
literally on a physical chemical level

851
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:44.560
when you said these things out loud to yourself.

852
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.638
And what's interesting in this

853
00:35:46.638 --> 00:35:49.204
is that oftentimes in the past

854
00:35:49.204 --> 00:35:51.410
when we're looking at doing affirmations and the sort,

855
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.336
it requires, people fell they are required to

856
00:35:54.336 --> 00:35:56.043
believe what they're saying.

857
00:35:56.043 --> 00:35:58.411
But what you're saying, it sounds to me,

858
00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:00.687
is no, you have to make a commitment

859
00:36:00.687 --> 00:36:02.820
to saying it to yourself, a commitment

860
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.153
to look at the card, your commitment

861
00:36:05.153 --> 00:36:07.290
is to engage with it

862
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.960
and the feelings will come with that.

863
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.992
You don't have to automatically believe

864
00:36:11.992 --> 00:36:14.198
in your heart and soul, I am a success,

865
00:36:14.198 --> 00:36:15.521
when you feel like a failure.

866
00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:16.969
It's lying to yourself.

867
00:36:16.969 --> 00:36:18.304
Can you talk about that.

868
00:36:18.304 --> 00:36:20.336
<v ->Yeah, I've often thought about that.</v>

869
00:36:20.336 --> 00:36:23.297
I've never had to come to believe any of this.

870
00:36:23.297 --> 00:36:26.211
I never say to people, I never say to myself,

871
00:36:26.211 --> 00:36:28.846
you have to believe in an affirmation

872
00:36:28.846 --> 00:36:30.982
or believe in anything.

873
00:36:30.982 --> 00:36:33.513
No, these are powerful tools.

874
00:36:33.513 --> 00:36:35.580
I say just do it, just try it,

875
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.122
just start affirming that you're,

876
00:36:38.122 --> 00:36:41.652
not that you're successful now if you're not.

877
00:36:41.652 --> 00:36:43.588
Don't affirm I'm now a millionaire

878
00:36:43.588 --> 00:36:45.655
if you're struggling to pay the rent.

879
00:36:45.655 --> 00:36:47.686
But find what works.

880
00:36:47.686 --> 00:36:51.901
For me it was, I am creating total financial success.

881
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:54.429
Here I was on the verge of bankruptcy,

882
00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:57.169
but I started affirming I am sensible

883
00:36:57.169 --> 00:36:59.108
and in control of my finances.

884
00:36:59.108 --> 00:37:02.545
I am creating total financial success.

885
00:37:03.745 --> 00:37:07.014
If you say that, part of you accepts it.

886
00:37:07.014 --> 00:37:09.452
I think the way it works is

887
00:37:09.452 --> 00:37:12.947
your subconscious mind says yes to every thought.

888
00:37:12.947 --> 00:37:15.756
So when you say I am sensible and in control,

889
00:37:15.756 --> 00:37:17.625
I am creating total financial success...

890
00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:18.798
<v Voiceover>That's data in.</v>

891
00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:20.757
<v ->Yes, data in, your subconscious says yes</v>

892
00:37:20.757 --> 00:37:22.568
and starts showing you how simple it is

893
00:37:22.568 --> 00:37:24.971
and what the simple next step to take is.

894
00:37:24.971 --> 00:37:28.802
But then, if you start saying oh but it's so hard,

895
00:37:28.802 --> 00:37:31.911
so few people succeed, your subconscious says

896
00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:34.779
yes it's so hard for you with that thought, yes.

897
00:37:34.779 --> 00:37:36.648
That's the way it works.

898
00:37:36.648 --> 00:37:39.783
<v Voiceover>And you're talking about genuine power,</v>

899
00:37:39.783 --> 00:37:43.219
symbolic and energetic power behind each of these words

900
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:45.724
that you're either looking at or you're uttering.

901
00:37:45.724 --> 00:37:49.183
The subconscious mind, it's working off of

902
00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:50.528
energy and symbols.

903
00:37:50.528 --> 00:37:51.990
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

904
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.765
<v Voiceover>So it's truly going in regardless of belief</v>

905
00:37:54.765 --> 00:37:55.694
as you say.

906
00:37:55.694 --> 00:37:57.970
<v ->Yeah, yeah, so there's nothing to believe.</v>

907
00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:02.436
Just know that we do have some very mysterious power

908
00:38:02.436 --> 00:38:05.545
we'll never understand, but we can set it in motion.

909
00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.809
And we set it in motion with finding

910
00:38:07.809 --> 00:38:09.434
the right affirmation for us.

911
00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:12.372
I am now creating success doing what I love.

912
00:38:12.372 --> 00:38:15.077
I am now writing a brilliant book,

913
00:38:15.077 --> 00:38:18.548
I am now doing my art in a way

914
00:38:18.548 --> 00:38:20.684
that touches people's hearts so much

915
00:38:20.684 --> 00:38:24.864
that they wish to pay 25 thousand for my painting,

916
00:38:24.864 --> 00:38:26.056
whatever it is.

917
00:38:26.056 --> 00:38:27.624
<v Voiceover>I want to see your paintings.</v>

918
00:38:27.624 --> 00:38:29.333
<v ->Yeah, right, right, right.</v>

919
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:33.234
<v Voiceover>Yeah, no that's absolutely, that's a really</v>

920
00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:35.800
huge point that I think has been a big gap

921
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.205
for people to get over.

922
00:38:37.205 --> 00:38:41.210
Because a lot of the metaphysical or new age thought is

923
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.575
you have to believe, you have to believe.

924
00:38:43.575 --> 00:38:44.980
But what you're saying is,

925
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.045
and very appropriately contradicting that

926
00:38:48.045 --> 00:38:50.013
and saying it's more than that,

927
00:38:50.013 --> 00:38:51.488
it's beyond belief.

928
00:38:51.488 --> 00:38:55.217
<v ->Yes. My wife gave me this frame that I talk about</v>

929
00:38:55.217 --> 00:38:56.848
in Greatest Secret of All that had

930
00:38:56.848 --> 00:38:58.424
four words stamped into it.

931
00:38:58.424 --> 00:39:01.187
Dream, imagine, believe, create.

932
00:39:01.187 --> 00:39:02.789
My first thought when I saw it,

933
00:39:02.789 --> 00:39:05.369
I thought this is the whole process.

934
00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:07.064
And then my next thought was,

935
00:39:07.064 --> 00:39:09.072
but there's really nothing to believe,

936
00:39:09.072 --> 00:39:12.404
you don't have to believe in it at all.

937
00:39:12.404 --> 00:39:15.109
You just dream, imagine and create.

938
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:17.382
But then I did think, well, you have to deal

939
00:39:17.382 --> 00:39:19.043
with the beliefs you have that are

940
00:39:19.043 --> 00:39:21.411
preventing you from creating it.

941
00:39:21.411 --> 00:39:23.083
That's the work.

942
00:39:23.083 --> 00:39:25.486
There's two essential things to do.

943
00:39:25.486 --> 00:39:28.354
Dare to dream and go for it.

944
00:39:28.354 --> 00:39:33.096
And then deal with all those old limiting beliefs

945
00:39:33.096 --> 00:39:36.831
that are preventing you from taking those simple steps.

946
00:39:36.831 --> 00:39:39.095
<v Voiceover>Makes perfect sense, of course.</v>

947
00:39:39.095 --> 00:39:41.069
And like you say, as you get older,

948
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:43.367
it becomes more distilled, the message is

949
00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:45.910
distilled down to the real essential components

950
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.672
and you've helped a lot of people with this.

951
00:39:49.202 --> 00:39:51.541
Let's talk about the Greatest Secret of All.

952
00:39:52.251 --> 00:39:53.686
Let's spend a little time on that.

953
00:39:53.686 --> 00:39:55.343
<v ->That's my favorite because</v>

954
00:39:56.493 --> 00:39:59.353
it's wonderful to be able to manifest what you want,

955
00:39:59.353 --> 00:40:02.557
it's wonderful to even create the life of your dreams.

956
00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:08.393
And as you do, just inevitably, you'll find yourself

957
00:40:08.393 --> 00:40:11.163
reflecting on what's really important in life.

958
00:40:11.163 --> 00:40:13.357
And what is important in life?

959
00:40:13.357 --> 00:40:16.573
To me, I just,

960
00:40:17.843 --> 00:40:20.672
I encourage everyone to ask these questions

961
00:40:20.672 --> 00:40:25.002
because it's the words we find within

962
00:40:25.002 --> 00:40:27.078
that really guide us.

963
00:40:27.078 --> 00:40:28.807
Maybe the greatest secret of all,

964
00:40:28.807 --> 00:40:30.781
it can be expressed in so many ways,

965
00:40:30.781 --> 00:40:34.183
but definitely one way to express it is

966
00:40:34.183 --> 00:40:37.457
it's finding our own inner guidance.

967
00:40:37.457 --> 00:40:40.731
It's becoming our own teachers.

968
00:40:40.731 --> 00:40:43.958
It's finding that the higher self

969
00:40:43.958 --> 00:40:47.372
or that expansive master within

970
00:40:47.372 --> 00:40:49.705
that guides each of us.

971
00:40:49.705 --> 00:40:53.694
And we realize we're,

972
00:40:54.512 --> 00:40:58.246
we don't trust other people totally any more.

973
00:40:58.246 --> 00:41:00.544
We realize whatever they say to us comes through

974
00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:03.122
their experience, even if they're a great teacher,

975
00:41:03.122 --> 00:41:06.872
it comes through their experience and their life.

976
00:41:06.872 --> 00:41:09.925
And that's very different from our experience and our life.

977
00:41:09.925 --> 00:41:12.677
And their guidance for us might be absolutely

978
00:41:12.677 --> 00:41:15.161
the worst possible thing in the moment for us.

979
00:41:15.161 --> 00:41:17.866
The best possible thing is only to be found

980
00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:21.640
within our own inner being.

981
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.436
That's where we find it all.

982
00:41:24.206 --> 00:41:26.237
When I ask that voice within then,

983
00:41:26.237 --> 00:41:28.347
what is the greatest secret of all?

984
00:41:28.347 --> 00:41:31.749
I get a very simple answer which I've already said.

985
00:41:31.749 --> 00:41:35.487
I just get, it's all about loving and serving

986
00:41:35.487 --> 00:41:37.748
yourself and others.

987
00:41:37.748 --> 00:41:41.521
And I even get, yes you gotta take care of yourself first.

988
00:41:41.521 --> 00:41:44.753
You dare to dream your fulfillment

989
00:41:44.753 --> 00:41:46.762
and take care of yourself

990
00:41:46.762 --> 00:41:49.595
because you need to be fulfilled

991
00:41:49.595 --> 00:41:54.204
before you can really help others become fulfilled.

992
00:41:54.204 --> 00:41:57.103
<v Voiceover>It's true and you've created an environment,</v>

993
00:41:57.103 --> 00:41:59.340
well, like the little plaque on the wall says,

994
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.440
it's considered to be the most wonderful place to work,

995
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.973
best place to work.

996
00:42:03.973 --> 00:42:07.543
So obviously your publishing company

997
00:42:07.543 --> 00:42:10.515
is producing all of these beautiful books

998
00:42:10.515 --> 00:42:12.985
with beautiful messages, so you're serving in that way.

999
00:42:12.985 --> 00:42:16.061
You're somehow trickling down your own

1000
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:20.078
philosophy which you live, to your employees

1001
00:42:20.078 --> 00:42:22.861
or they wouldn't be so happy to work here, right?

1002
00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.469
So you're serving in that way, you seem to have

1003
00:42:26.469 --> 00:42:28.057
a lot of happy campers around here.

1004
00:42:28.057 --> 00:42:30.135
<v ->Yeah we sure do. We sure do.</v>

1005
00:42:30.135 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Voiceover>And that has to be the missing link in the new</v>

1006
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.438
way of doing business and the new kind of success,

1007
00:42:35.438 --> 00:42:37.307
this connectedness with each other.

1008
00:42:38.817 --> 00:42:42.254
<v ->It is missing in a lot of companies and it surprises me.</v>

1009
00:42:42.254 --> 00:42:44.088
To me it just seems obvious.

1010
00:42:45.338 --> 00:42:47.088
When I first started the company,

1011
00:42:47.088 --> 00:42:49.189
before we even made money, I remember

1012
00:42:49.189 --> 00:42:52.022
I just happened to read an in flight magazine

1013
00:42:52.022 --> 00:42:56.167
about, I'd never read any business articles

1014
00:42:56.167 --> 00:42:58.837
but this happened to be something in front of me

1015
00:42:58.837 --> 00:43:00.532
while I was on a plane, so.

1016
00:43:00.532 --> 00:43:03.040
It was about a Swiss hotel that was failing

1017
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.896
and run down, and they fired the manager

1018
00:43:05.896 --> 00:43:08.113
and all the owners sat around and went to hire

1019
00:43:08.113 --> 00:43:09.505
this other manager.

1020
00:43:09.505 --> 00:43:11.445
And the manager said, well here's the deal,

1021
00:43:11.445 --> 00:43:13.985
you hire me, I'll put a third of the profits

1022
00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:17.416
to go to employees, and a third will go to you owners.

1023
00:43:17.416 --> 00:43:19.656
And some of the owners even said,

1024
00:43:19.656 --> 00:43:20.951
you mean you're giving employees

1025
00:43:20.951 --> 00:43:24.187
as much as you're giving owners?

1026
00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:27.890
And he says yes, that's the deal, take it or leave it,

1027
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.560
because that's what will work.

1028
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.566
To me it became so obvious that this formula

1029
00:43:34.566 --> 00:43:37.666
is just a no brainer for success.

1030
00:43:37.666 --> 00:43:40.975
The first year, he turned it around and made that

1031
00:43:40.975 --> 00:43:44.411
hotel profitable, and the employees got a bonus check

1032
00:43:44.411 --> 00:43:47.116
worth about two weeks of their salary.

1033
00:43:47.116 --> 00:43:49.821
After seven years when the article was written,

1034
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:52.817
the employees got a bonus check at the end of the year

1035
00:43:52.817 --> 00:43:56.122
worth over eight months of their salary.

1036
00:43:56.122 --> 00:43:57.651
Their annual salary.

1037
00:43:57.651 --> 00:43:58.757
<v Voiceover>Beautiful.</v>

1038
00:43:58.757 --> 00:44:01.627
<v ->The hotel looked beautiful, the employees were happy.</v>

1039
00:44:01.627 --> 00:44:02.892
<v Voiceover>Were the bosses happy?</v>

1040
00:44:02.892 --> 00:44:04.235
<v ->The bosses were ecstatic.</v>

1041
00:44:04.235 --> 00:44:07.623
And I said oh yeah, that's how to run a company.

1042
00:44:07.623 --> 00:44:10.930
You tell employees, half the profits go to employees,

1043
00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.834
half the profits go to owners.

1044
00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:15.307
First you need to retain whatever you need to retain

1045
00:44:15.307 --> 00:44:18.082
for your growth or whatever, you retain that,

1046
00:44:18.082 --> 00:44:19.742
but you split the rest.

1047
00:44:19.742 --> 00:44:22.110
People say that's so generous.

1048
00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.884
It's not generous, it's just smart business.

1049
00:44:25.884 --> 00:44:28.388
Because I know, I can show on paper,

1050
00:44:28.388 --> 00:44:31.593
because I give half my profits to my employees,

1051
00:44:31.593 --> 00:44:33.996
every employee, even the part time guy in shipping,

1052
00:44:33.996 --> 00:44:38.005
every employee gets a profit sharing substantial check.

1053
00:44:38.005 --> 00:44:41.371
Because of that I make more than twice the profits.

1054
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:43.368
I absolutely know it.

1055
00:44:43.368 --> 00:44:46.004
<v Voiceover>That's fabulous and so right on.</v>

1056
00:44:46.004 --> 00:44:48.976
<v ->Yeah, I know, it just makes sense.</v>

1057
00:44:48.976 --> 00:44:51.147
They say, you know,

1058
00:44:52.717 --> 00:44:54.839
people think it's so noble and generous

1059
00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:56.813
and it's not at all, it's just...

1060
00:44:56.813 --> 00:44:58.879
<v Voiceover>Happy people, happy business.</v>

1061
00:44:58.879 --> 00:45:00.583
<v ->And it's where I make more money.</v>

1062
00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:03.810
In the long run I make more.

1063
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.094
I can even show in percentages most publishers

1064
00:45:06.094 --> 00:45:08.367
make a five to ten percent pre tax profit,

1065
00:45:08.367 --> 00:45:09.795
most print publishers.

1066
00:45:09.795 --> 00:45:12.233
We make at least three or four times that.

1067
00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:16.406
So right there, it's proof, it's proof.

1068
00:45:16.406 --> 00:45:18.971
I make more money by giving my people,

1069
00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:23.410
every dollar I retain, every dollar I get as a bonus,

1070
00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.813
I give a dollar to my employees.

1071
00:45:25.813 --> 00:45:28.216
<v Voiceover>Well, obviously you've put,</v>

1072
00:45:28.216 --> 00:45:31.185
you've given a lot of thought to all of this clearly.

1073
00:45:31.185 --> 00:45:33.020
I mean, even though you say you're lazy

1074
00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.550
and you don't real business articles,

1075
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:36.686
and it sounds like that's all true.

1076
00:45:36.686 --> 00:45:38.323
<v ->Yeah, it is.</v>

1077
00:45:38.323 --> 00:45:41.957
<v Voiceover>But you have given a lot of thought to it</v>

1078
00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:45.184
and you have followed that love, that passion, that heart.

1079
00:45:45.184 --> 00:45:49.364
And you, it sounds like you really insist

1080
00:45:49.364 --> 00:45:52.136
that the people around you follow their passion

1081
00:45:52.136 --> 00:45:55.073
and heart as well, and you all raise the ship together.

1082
00:45:55.073 --> 00:45:57.744
<v ->Yeah, I encourage each one of them to find,</v>

1083
00:45:57.744 --> 00:46:00.367
you know, what they love to do and to do it.

1084
00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:03.514
I get people here that love what they're doing

1085
00:46:03.514 --> 00:46:06.521
in the company and those are the ones that stay.

1086
00:46:06.521 --> 00:46:08.717
<v Voiceover>Yeah, very good.</v>

1087
00:46:08.717 --> 00:46:11.215
Well, so,

1088
00:46:11.215 --> 00:46:13.757
I'm totally enjoying this conversation

1089
00:46:13.757 --> 00:46:15.290
and listening to you.

1090
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.459
Any other final thoughts before we wrap up here.

1091
00:46:18.459 --> 00:46:20.766
You're obviously living the life

1092
00:46:20.766 --> 00:46:23.274
that you saw all those years ago.

1093
00:46:23.274 --> 00:46:26.037
You work Tuesday through Thursday afternoons

1094
00:46:26.037 --> 00:46:27.674
for sure, pretty much?

1095
00:46:27.674 --> 00:46:29.509
Everything else is negotiable.

1096
00:46:29.509 --> 00:46:31.947
Everything else is negotiable and you can do

1097
00:46:31.947 --> 00:46:34.176
what you wish with it, which now that's

1098
00:46:34.176 --> 00:46:36.483
a dream in and of itself for most people.

1099
00:46:36.483 --> 00:46:39.154
Anything else you'd like to share at this point

1100
00:46:39.154 --> 00:46:41.023
because you have to still be going through

1101
00:46:41.023 --> 00:46:42.486
your own growth and learning.

1102
00:46:42.486 --> 00:46:45.864
<v ->Sure, oh yeah, it's an endless wonderful process.</v>

1103
00:46:48.354 --> 00:46:50.231
Gee, this morning I just had such thoughts,

1104
00:46:50.231 --> 00:46:53.319
I walked out and it was so beautiful,

1105
00:46:53.319 --> 00:46:55.131
the big storm clouds were there

1106
00:46:55.131 --> 00:46:56.501
and the sun was shining through,

1107
00:46:56.501 --> 00:46:58.904
it was almost like an Ansel Adams photo.

1108
00:46:58.904 --> 00:47:01.760
And I have a beautiful house on a hill

1109
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.442
with these great views, and I thought

1110
00:47:05.432 --> 00:47:09.254
the beauty of it all is just overwhelming.

1111
00:47:09.254 --> 00:47:12.121
And I thought what is beauty?

1112
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:16.684
And I realized beauty is what opens your heart.

1113
00:47:16.684 --> 00:47:19.612
That's why we love beautiful art.

1114
00:47:19.612 --> 00:47:22.956
That's why we love people, some people

1115
00:47:22.956 --> 00:47:26.671
that are so beautiful they just open our heart, you know.

1116
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:30.308
And just having some kind of beauty

1117
00:47:30.308 --> 00:47:33.308
or acknowledging the beauty in our lives

1118
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:36.838
is a wonderful way to open our hearts.

1119
00:47:36.838 --> 00:47:41.552
And that's the key to a life well lived, an open heart.

1120
00:47:41.552 --> 00:47:44.149
And the key to success.

1121
00:47:44.149 --> 00:47:46.385
Doing what you love,

1122
00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:49.752
you never have to work then.

1123
00:47:49.752 --> 00:47:51.755
I never liked that word work.

1124
00:47:52.685 --> 00:47:56.792
There's some good things, there is a great work ahead of us

1125
00:47:56.792 --> 00:48:00.268
as Riane Eisler says, overcoming

1126
00:48:00.268 --> 00:48:02.602
the established dominator model.

1127
00:48:02.602 --> 00:48:05.862
Both on a political national level

1128
00:48:05.862 --> 00:48:10.239
and anything personal, any attempts that we have

1129
00:48:10.239 --> 00:48:13.309
to dominate or exploit others we need to

1130
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:16.548
totally get rid of and replace with partnership model,

1131
00:48:16.548 --> 00:48:18.081
a pure partnership.

1132
00:48:18.081 --> 00:48:21.055
The dominator model is based on fear

1133
00:48:21.055 --> 00:48:23.354
and there's a need to control.

1134
00:48:23.354 --> 00:48:25.897
We need to replace it all with partnership

1135
00:48:25.897 --> 00:48:29.194
which is based on love and total respect,

1136
00:48:29.194 --> 00:48:30.999
respect for all other people.

1137
00:48:30.999 --> 00:48:34.262
That's the key to the solution of the world's problems.

1138
00:48:34.262 --> 00:48:36.665
We need to respect everyone in the world

1139
00:48:36.665 --> 00:48:39.277
and work in partnership with them.

1140
00:48:39.277 --> 00:48:41.274
We need to quit bombing people

1141
00:48:41.274 --> 00:48:44.177
and say we're stuck together on this planet

1142
00:48:44.177 --> 00:48:47.578
as one dysfunctional family, how do we get along?

1143
00:48:47.578 --> 00:48:48.948
How do we get along?

1144
00:48:48.948 --> 00:48:52.254
Well, let's see, quit bombing people for a start,

1145
00:48:52.254 --> 00:48:56.513
and quit killing people, and sit down and negotiate

1146
00:48:56.513 --> 00:48:59.923
and see how we can work together

1147
00:49:00.863 --> 00:49:02.867
as one global family.

1148
00:49:02.867 --> 00:49:05.897
<v Voiceover>And that starts one decision and thought</v>

1149
00:49:05.897 --> 00:49:07.703
individually at a time.

1150
00:49:07.703 --> 00:49:11.209
<v ->Yes, yes, one little step at a time.</v>

1151
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:14.108
So that's the great work ahead of us.

1152
00:49:14.108 --> 00:49:16.541
<v Voiceover>On that note, I thank you so much for taking</v>

1153
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:18.917
the time out of your not so busy schedule. (laughs)

1154
00:49:18.917 --> 00:49:20.810
<v ->Yeah, right, I have nothing else to do today.</v>

1155
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.215
<v Voiceover>Thanks for getting up.</v>

1156
00:49:22.215 --> 00:49:24.287
<v ->Thank you Regina.</v>

1157
00:49:26.614 --> 00:49:29.087
<v ->Marc has written a few books which you can check out</v>

1158
00:49:29.087 --> 00:49:31.897
by visiting his site newworldlibrary.com.

1159
00:49:31.897 --> 00:49:33.728
The book we spoke about today is titled

1160
00:49:33.728 --> 00:49:35.331
The Greatest Secret of All

1161
00:49:35.331 --> 00:49:38.163
which you can also buy in kindle form through Amazon.

1162
00:49:38.163 --> 00:49:41.762
He's got it figured out; love, passion, and persistence.

1163
00:49:41.762 --> 00:49:44.543
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1164
00:49:44.543 --> 00:49:48.621
(soft music)
