00:00:00.398 --> 00:00:03.126
<v ->What if there were a key in each human being</v>

2
00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:06.050
that could turn on or off our physical,

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.782
mental, and even spiritual well being?

4
00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:11.701
There's a growing group of people that say this exists.

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.814
It's the atlas bone,

6
00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:15.594
the cradle that holds our heads above our spines.

7
00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:16.983
For a variety of reasons,

8
00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.730
this bone is out of place,

9
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.463
pinching off our life force to one degree or another

10
00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:23.850
in the vast majority of the population,

11
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.558
and it can have severe implications

12
00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.606
regarding the quality of our lives.

13
00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:30.564 line:15% 
(soothing music)

14
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.106
What is the nature of the atlas profilax work,

15
00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.200
let's just lay the foundation of it.

16
00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:46.080
<v ->It is correcting the atlas vertebrae,</v>

17
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.792
the first cervical vertebrae which supports the skull,

18
00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:52.800
its the pedestal, the saddle,

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.984
and the work entails simply installing

20
00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:59.629
or correcting the C1.

21
00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.037
Not adjusting,

22
00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:03.943
we're actually putting it back into it's correct position.

23
00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:07.426
<v ->What I've read in the literature about this,</v>

24
00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:09.292
I mean this is all very new to me,

25
00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:10.962
there aren't that many practitioners

26
00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.012
it sounds like in the U.S.,

27
00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:14.264
it's really just now coming in, is that correct?

28
00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:14.686
<v ->That's right.</v>

29
00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:16.730
<v ->But you say in Europe it's fairly well saturated,</v>

30
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.228
most countries have practitioners?

31
00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:20.261
<v ->Well I wouldn't say well saturated,</v>

32
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:23.474
I think there's about 100 trained practitioners

33
00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:24.922
there in Switzerland,

34
00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:26.674
of course there's a greater concentration.

35
00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.172
My father as of two years ago

36
00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:32.244
was the 24th practitioner trained,

37
00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:34.548
and since then it's cumulatively

38
00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:36.064
been getting more popular,

39
00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:38.432
so we're up to about 100,

40
00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.415
you can find at least one in most of the European countries,

41
00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:44.000
but they're most concentrated in Switzerland

42
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.959
and Germany and a bit in Austria,

43
00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.320
there was a big training there recently.

44
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.135
<v ->And now it's making it's way to the United States.</v>

45
00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:51.990
<v ->Slowly, yeah.</v>

46
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.124
<v ->What is such a breakthrough</v>

47
00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:54.928
about this particular technology

48
00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:59.336
that has not been brought to light prior to this?

49
00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:02.876
<v ->Well there's several pioneers</v>

50
00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:05.652
that have been working with the atlas,

51
00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:10.324
this is not a new thing as far as the understanding

52
00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.627
that the atlas is vital for our well being,

53
00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:15.291
so there's been a number of people

54
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:18.984
who've developed techniques to work on the atlas.

55
00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:21.602
The Palmer Blair method, there's NUCCA...

56
00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:24.187
That's in New York,

57
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.920
and there's a few other people doing this work.

58
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.163
But what makes this different is a combination

59
00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:35.490
of the philosophy that the atlas...

60
00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:42.523
As designed by nature is meant to fit in correctly

61
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:46.611
in the right position for well being,

62
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.805
for total body balance.

63
00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:52.826
Also in combination of a specific tool

64
00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:55.986
that was invented by Rene Schumperli

65
00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.758
over many years of research and development

66
00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:03.730
that is very different than the tools you use in the states

67
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.406
to install or adjust the atlas.

68
00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:11.099
What makes this different is we use the word installation.

69
00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.451
It's not a neck crack, we don't use a special table.

70
00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:18.216
we don't rely on an activator or a...

71
00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:22.618
A quick--

72
00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:23.706
<v ->Almost percussive.</v>

73
00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:25.823
<v ->Percussive motion.</v>

74
00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:27.595
The tool is very specific,

75
00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:31.397
and it has a pulsating motion on the end

76
00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:33.445
that allows a sustained pressure

77
00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:37.389
to actually flow to the atlas into its correct position

78
00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.113
with the proper guidance of the practitioner.

79
00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:43.585
Also because of the nature of the muscles

80
00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:46.894
that they get very tense over time,

81
00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:49.345
it works within the muscle tissue.

82
00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:51.841
So we're first working through the muscle tissue,

83
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:55.056
and then we finally start guiding the atlas into place

84
00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:57.852
once the muscles have released.

85
00:03:57.852 --> 00:03:59.949
So there is quite a bit of difference.

86
00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.564
<v ->So it is an installation?</v>

87
00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:02.810
<v ->It is an installation.</v>

88
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.242
We don't adjust.

89
00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:09.110
Again twerk the neck in any such way.

90
00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:11.603
<v ->So now let's start going back</v>

91
00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:14.912
and build the base of understanding

92
00:04:14.912 --> 00:04:18.731
as to why, as I've read,

93
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.419
virtually everybody has an atlas

94
00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.168
that is not in the correct position.

95
00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:26.112
How can this be, why is this?

96
00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:28.371
If we're designed for it to fit,

97
00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:30.592
why is it not fitting to begin with?

98
00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:34.347
<v ->Well, probably because it was never in to begin with.</v>

99
00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:37.503
And in the institute and through my experience

100
00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:39.522
as a body worker,

101
00:04:39.522 --> 00:04:42.613
a lot of this has occurred in early childhood

102
00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:44.725
when bones are not fully developed,

103
00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:46.965
when the underlining of the skull

104
00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:49.933
does not have the same topography

105
00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:53.731
and condyle structures under there to hold the atlas,

106
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:58.731
it's developing as we're in the early months of our being.

107
00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:06.473
Often times it can come out in those early months,

108
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.397
and especially if you've had traumatic birthing.

109
00:05:09.397 --> 00:05:12.573
Cesarean sections where they can sometimes

110
00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:14.517
pull the child out,

111
00:05:14.517 --> 00:05:17.781
under the stressful environments of hospitals at times,

112
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:19.465
where their people are rushed.

113
00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:22.265
Sometimes the care is not always there.

114
00:05:23.384 --> 00:05:26.939
Considering the fragility of the infant

115
00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.027
coupled with the fact that their muscles,

116
00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.651
I mean they can't even hold their heads up.

117
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:32.443
It's a very delicate situation,

118
00:05:32.443 --> 00:05:36.450
so I see a lot of luxation of the atlas

119
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.887
caused by traumatic birthing

120
00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:41.378
and things that happened early on.

121
00:05:41.378 --> 00:05:45.647
And of course the falls and the mishandlings.

122
00:05:45.647 --> 00:05:49.275
So from the very get go it's out slightly.

123
00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:52.475
<v ->Doesn't it just seem like a weird little apparition</v>

124
00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:53.984
of nature that you could be...

125
00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:57.733
that we're born with a certain skeletal structure

126
00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:02.733
that is if not perfect, at least ideal for what we are,

127
00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:06.033
and then have it flawed from birth on?

128
00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:10.237
<v ->Yeah, it's a question I have to answer quite a bit,</v>

129
00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:14.444
and people always want to know why is this atlas out?

130
00:06:14.444 --> 00:06:17.555
And there's so many ideas and theories and possibilities

131
00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:18.795
and you have to take into account

132
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.907
the history of our lives and various traumas

133
00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:22.955
that we've gone through.

134
00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:24.339
A lot of people that come to me

135
00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.539
are already in their fifties who've had

136
00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.883
multiple car accidents,

137
00:06:27.883 --> 00:06:32.883
who can all relate to some experience where they've fallen,

138
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.805
or they can relate to some moment

139
00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:39.626
where they felt like something certainly was not right.

140
00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:40.310
<v ->Whiplash.</v>

141
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.379
<v ->Whiplash is huge, you know?</v>

142
00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.055
But if you want to go more into the esoteric realm,

143
00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:47.431
which you probably do,

144
00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:48.967
and a lot of people here--

145
00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:50.543
<v ->Yes, I do. (laughs)</v>

146
00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.605
<v ->A lot of people that email me and write me</v>

147
00:06:53.605 --> 00:06:57.189
have read an article written by Jean Clark Cowan,

148
00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.072
and he has been kind of a pioneer in this work,

149
00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:04.824
he also received the atlas profilux work,

150
00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.192
and it made huge shifts with him.

151
00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:12.613
He firmly believes that we have been manipulated,

152
00:07:12.613 --> 00:07:15.669
our DNA, our genetics have been altered,

153
00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.720
by intelligent life beings.

154
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.111
<v ->I've read this as well.</v>

155
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.470
<v ->Have used minerals and other resources</v>

156
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.398
on this planet to better their own habitat,

157
00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:32.450
and they've used homo sapiens to do this.

158
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.950
So the idea is that by luxating the atlas,

159
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.678
by throwing it out,

160
00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:40.745
by creating pressure on the brain stem

161
00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:42.729
and thus the nervous system,

162
00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.910
the complete organism is under pressure

163
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.193
and therefore is more docile,

164
00:07:49.193 --> 00:07:51.408
more easily to be controlled...

165
00:07:52.984 --> 00:07:55.864
Gets caught in ruts, you know?

166
00:07:55.864 --> 00:07:57.987
Hard to pull out of.

167
00:07:57.987 --> 00:08:01.111
<v ->That's exactly one of the theories</v>

168
00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:02.199
that I've read about this,

169
00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.995
which is interesting if you follow

170
00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:07.235
some of the work of many people out there.

171
00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:08.358
Zecharia Sitchin and others,

172
00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:11.110
that we're genetically engineered species,

173
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.497
in which case maybe just throw this little bit out

174
00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:15.482
and keep us a little more manageable

175
00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:17.089
or docile like you said.

176
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.068
Maybe on some has been by design,

177
00:08:19.068 --> 00:08:21.332
if you're going to look to the esoteric for it.

178
00:08:21.332 --> 00:08:22.785
<v ->Subserving.</v>

179
00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:25.148
<v ->Subserving. It worked.</v>

180
00:08:25.148 --> 00:08:27.917
So here we are, and now we're waking up,

181
00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:30.573
so let's talk about first some of the things

182
00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:34.405
that have happened by way of dysfunction

183
00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:37.500
to our lives and beings and our ability to perform...

184
00:08:38.594 --> 00:08:41.148
as a result of having this thing out of whack.

185
00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:45.259
<v ->Well I see it on three levels.</v>

186
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.283
You have the physical discomfort

187
00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:50.251
and the pain that we obviously can experience

188
00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:51.957
pretty easily in our daily lives.

189
00:08:51.957 --> 00:08:53.966
And then we have the spiritual

190
00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:55.842
and then we have the emotional.

191
00:08:55.842 --> 00:08:58.766
And people come to me for a variety of reasons,

192
00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:03.629
some people come for physical release and relief,

193
00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:06.146
and some others are looking for spiritual clarity

194
00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:10.581
and something emotional they feel is coming up in them

195
00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:12.181
outside of this work,

196
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.101
then they hear about it and they get turned on,

197
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:16.945
then they hear about the article and you really start.

198
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.047
People just either feel strongly about it

199
00:09:21.047 --> 00:09:24.090
or they completely tune it out.

200
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.593
Physically what happens to the body

201
00:09:25.593 --> 00:09:28.407
when the atlas is out of alignment,

202
00:09:28.407 --> 00:09:31.374
that immediately starts throwing off

203
00:09:31.374 --> 00:09:32.638
the balance of the body,

204
00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:33.939
is primarily in the hips.

205
00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:37.128
So you get a short leg, that's very common,

206
00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:40.520
and almost every chiropractor can confirm this.

207
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.145
We have a short leg which puts more pressure

208
00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:46.173
on that side of the body.

209
00:09:46.173 --> 00:09:48.663
In other words more weight will be over time...

210
00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:51.249
Weighted on that side.

211
00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:53.853
So it will affect and disrupt the low back.

212
00:09:53.853 --> 00:09:55.812
It'll cause tension in the hips,

213
00:09:55.812 --> 00:09:59.293
and that'll definitely translate into the shoulder areas.

214
00:09:59.293 --> 00:10:04.221
And the body has a way of just knowing when it is unstable,

215
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:06.801
so it splints by contracting muscles.

216
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:08.593
So neck muscles get tight,

217
00:10:08.593 --> 00:10:09.834
shoulder muscles get tight,

218
00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:13.245
and you start seeing people walking like this.

219
00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:14.549
And like this.

220
00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:18.325
The atlas that's dislocated can also throw

221
00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:21.929
the whole cranium forward,

222
00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:25.769
and also the weight of it which is ten to fourteen pounds

223
00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:28.733
or so is actually being pushed down,

224
00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:33.585
so we can actually go now into the spiritual realm of it.

225
00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:36.221
What is the organism when they're unable

226
00:10:36.221 --> 00:10:38.073
to look up comfortably?

227
00:10:38.073 --> 00:10:41.958
And we feel a pressure or oppressive feeling

228
00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.345
on the back of the neck,

229
00:10:43.345 --> 00:10:45.265
and then the tension of the neck muscles

230
00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:46.289
and the shoulders.

231
00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:48.721
You know you're looking down a lot,

232
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:53.089
so metaphorically you're not looking in people's eyes,

233
00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:55.177
you're not looking up and out,

234
00:10:55.177 --> 00:10:57.697
You're not seeing the abundance that's coming in.

235
00:10:57.697 --> 00:11:01.384
You're more dealing with your daily troubles,

236
00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:03.368
you're feeling oppressed in other words,

237
00:11:03.368 --> 00:11:05.792
and that's exactly how the manpulation

238
00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:09.736
of the C1, what it can cause in the organism.

239
00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:13.161
So it begins to break down over time,

240
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:16.278
and it only is when people get a little older.

241
00:11:16.278 --> 00:11:17.302
But I'm not saying everyone

242
00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.710
because I've treated children,

243
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.889
I've treated 20 year olds that already are feeling horrible.

244
00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:25.346
They already have problems with their low back,

245
00:11:25.346 --> 00:11:30.346
and TMJ, temporal mandibular joint,

246
00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:35.028
that symptom where people are grinding their teeth

247
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:39.007
which is typically an anxious, neurological thing.

248
00:11:39.007 --> 00:11:41.247
For releasing, people have their mouth guards.

249
00:11:41.247 --> 00:11:44.230
And then the epidemic of migraine headaches.

250
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.041
<v ->I was going to ask you about that next.</v>

251
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:48.665
<v ->And this is getting back into the physical realm,</v>

252
00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:53.017
but that can wear down the spirit as well.

253
00:11:53.017 --> 00:11:56.832
So again you can go into a spiritual aspect to this.

254
00:11:56.832 --> 00:11:59.308
Where when you live with pain,

255
00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:03.296
you tend to lose trust in abundance,

256
00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:04.512
and the universe--

257
00:12:04.512 --> 00:12:05.536
<v ->And each other, even.</v>

258
00:12:05.536 --> 00:12:07.622
<v ->And each other, and that there is...</v>

259
00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:11.000
A light at the end of the tunnel.

260
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.732
I mean if you're afflicted by pain chronically,

261
00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:17.118
it's hard to know that things are in balance

262
00:12:17.118 --> 00:12:20.743
and things are flowing with the universe, and that...

263
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.973
<v ->Yeah, I totally understand what you're saying.</v>

264
00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:30.092
So let's talk about some case examples

265
00:12:30.092 --> 00:12:31.830
that you've worked on.

266
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.553
Some conditions that people have come in with,

267
00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:39.693
and some of the experiences they've had afterward.

268
00:12:39.693 --> 00:12:41.563
And we'll get back to in a little bit

269
00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:44.395
some of the not side effects,

270
00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:47.363
but reactions to it that happen as well.

271
00:12:47.363 --> 00:12:49.573
So if you don't mind launching into two

272
00:12:49.573 --> 00:12:52.856
or three cases that you found particularly interesting.

273
00:12:54.994 --> 00:12:57.854
<v ->Well the most recent one has been a woman</v>

274
00:12:57.854 --> 00:13:00.178
that's had MS, multiple sclerosis,

275
00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:03.222
and she has a lot of the common symptoms

276
00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:05.910
of the shaking, and she's in her fifties.

277
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.794
She's had real trouble with her hearing as well,

278
00:13:10.794 --> 00:13:14.341
numbness, tinnitus, ringing in the ears.

279
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:15.992
She walks with a cane.

280
00:13:17.022 --> 00:13:19.582
And fate brought us together,

281
00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:23.910
she received the treatment, and within a weeks time,

282
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.814
after following up with her,

283
00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:29.714
the shaking had disappeared

284
00:13:29.714 --> 00:13:32.387
and she doesn't walk with a cane.

285
00:13:32.387 --> 00:13:35.075
But aside from that she was kind

286
00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:38.203
of a twitchy, nervous individual

287
00:13:38.203 --> 00:13:42.759
that has an anxious element to her,

288
00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:45.959
and here's someone who now does not shake,

289
00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.643
that does not need her cane.

290
00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:51.315
Still is not 100% back to normal,

291
00:13:51.315 --> 00:13:55.687
but certainly feels so much more calmer.

292
00:13:55.687 --> 00:13:58.823
That points directly to the neurological effect

293
00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:01.018
that increasing pressure on the brain stem

294
00:14:01.018 --> 00:14:03.815
due to a dislodged atlas creates.

295
00:14:03.815 --> 00:14:07.565
So the MS individual...

296
00:14:09.127 --> 00:14:11.557
Was touching because she really did improve,

297
00:14:11.557 --> 00:14:12.932
and very quickly.

298
00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:16.177
Atlas work is very quick.

299
00:14:16.177 --> 00:14:18.863
<v ->It's not something you do repeatedly either, is it?</v>

300
00:14:18.863 --> 00:14:21.157
<v ->Well in this method, no.</v>

301
00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:27.447
This methodology was designed to be a one time visit,

302
00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:29.605
with a follow up a month later,

303
00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:32.332
or some time later just to recheck.

304
00:14:32.332 --> 00:14:34.341
But this is not something where we do

305
00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:38.329
baby adjustments and then we take an x-ray,

306
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:41.125
and then recheck, and reposition,

307
00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:44.428
and readjust, and have them come back a week later.

308
00:14:44.428 --> 00:14:45.900
No, because the nature of the atlas,

309
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.381
it is a stubborn bone, it's part of the earth element,

310
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:51.961
it sometimes does not want to shift.

311
00:14:51.961 --> 00:14:54.820
And due to the history of the organism,

312
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.185
or the person,

313
00:14:56.185 --> 00:14:58.297
the muscles can be very tight and used

314
00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:01.443
to being off in a certain way, and it'll pull out.

315
00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:06.426
So anyway, back to what we're talking about.

316
00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.801
<v ->That's a point that's good to make.</v>

317
00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:12.494
Now another couple stories that touched you.

318
00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:13.450
<v ->Oh gosh.</v>

319
00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:15.837
Well...

320
00:15:17.763 --> 00:15:21.047
What's touching is when you can see how quickly it works.

321
00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:23.759
Having someone that has a tremendous amount of pain

322
00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.995
in the lower back.

323
00:15:24.995 --> 00:15:26.423
And when we do the leg test

324
00:15:26.423 --> 00:15:29.647
where we see the imbalance of the legs,

325
00:15:29.647 --> 00:15:31.223
and we have them turn side to side,

326
00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:33.507
you can kind of test the static and the stress,

327
00:15:33.507 --> 00:15:36.427
and how the hips are lying.

328
00:15:36.427 --> 00:15:39.543
Seeing people who have a hip that's raised

329
00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:43.747
to one side, that's obviously the traumatic side,

330
00:15:43.747 --> 00:15:44.643
the short leg.

331
00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:48.823
And seeing it be in balance immediately

332
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.254
after the installation,

333
00:15:50.254 --> 00:15:52.791
doing the leg test after and seeing

334
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:54.656
that the balance has restored,

335
00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:57.557
and seeing that there's evenness.

336
00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:00.309
The shoulders have immediately dropped

337
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:01.740
and have pulled back.

338
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.086
In other words the guarding

339
00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:06.647
and the protection has let go.

340
00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:09.699
So I see that a lot and I'm very touched by that.

341
00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:11.634
And that's a pretty common thing.

342
00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:14.014
But actually now that you mentioned that,

343
00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.871
I'm recalling, you know sometimes I forget,

344
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:18.253
because I see so many people.

345
00:16:18.253 --> 00:16:20.079
But just yesterday or two days ago,

346
00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.938
we had a woman who had severe scoliosis.

347
00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:27.938
Very advanced, she's in her 70's, or 69 I believe.

348
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.253
Very difficult atlas to palpate.

349
00:16:33.253 --> 00:16:36.497
Her spine was of course completely crooked,

350
00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:37.771
and the muscles were...

351
00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:43.619
Had developed to accommodate that.

352
00:16:45.609 --> 00:16:50.609
And working with her and her partner was wonderful

353
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:53.184
and creating a space for her,

354
00:16:53.184 --> 00:16:57.007
because it was intense and painful.

355
00:16:57.007 --> 00:17:01.722
And having her respond in the way she did

356
00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:04.046
after it was installed,

357
00:17:04.046 --> 00:17:06.586
the eyes brightening up.

358
00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:11.586
After 69 years, feeling for the first time,

359
00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:15.527
her head being able to turn with greater mobility,

360
00:17:15.527 --> 00:17:17.339
without the restriction.

361
00:17:19.052 --> 00:17:23.020
And almost feeling the emotions coming out

362
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.976
where her breathing changed,

363
00:17:26.976 --> 00:17:30.912
and just thanking God and greater that she had come,

364
00:17:30.912 --> 00:17:33.634
and that this modality was here,

365
00:17:33.634 --> 00:17:35.338
and that we could do it in one treatment

366
00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:38.774
and not pull people through a series.

367
00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:41.142
<v ->Which is expensive and time consuming as well,</v>

368
00:17:41.142 --> 00:17:42.826
just on a practical level.

369
00:17:42.826 --> 00:17:44.406
What a relief to know that you can come

370
00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:46.689
and have something so profound done

371
00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:49.070
in such a short space of time.

372
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.306
So what are some of the reactions

373
00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:51.610
that people might experience

374
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.214
with such a profound type of shift going on?

375
00:17:55.214 --> 00:17:57.554
<v ->Yeah, good question.</v>

376
00:17:57.554 --> 00:17:59.825
And you know it's really hard to say,

377
00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:01.873
because we have to take into account

378
00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:04.136
the vitality of the being,

379
00:18:04.136 --> 00:18:05.757
what kind of history they have,

380
00:18:05.757 --> 00:18:08.680
what kind of accidents and trauma they've gone through,

381
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.419
and what are they coming here to receive from it.

382
00:18:13.505 --> 00:18:15.596
Some people just wanna feel better physically,

383
00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:17.729
they have lower back pains.

384
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.757
Some people wanna feel more spiritual clarity,

385
00:18:20.757 --> 00:18:23.475
or they want to have deeper meditation.

386
00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:27.297
I just had a call from a man in Colorado

387
00:18:27.297 --> 00:18:28.827
who does Kundalini work,

388
00:18:28.827 --> 00:18:31.154
and he finds that everybody gets stuck

389
00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:32.455
right at the nape of the neck.

390
00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:36.187
So people are coming for that to be opened up

391
00:18:36.187 --> 00:18:40.050
and to have a reaction which allows more energy flow.

392
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.374
Typically what you get immediately is

393
00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:44.978
oh my goodness, I can turn my head again,

394
00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:48.367
without having to move the whole torso to look behind you.

395
00:18:49.866 --> 00:18:52.021
So physically what people will feel

396
00:18:52.021 --> 00:18:57.021
is openness in the neck muscles and mobility of the head.

397
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.729
The shoulders will feel better,

398
00:18:59.729 --> 00:19:04.613
breathing changes, and the low back can open up.

399
00:19:04.613 --> 00:19:06.597
And immediately you see like I mentioned before,

400
00:19:06.597 --> 00:19:07.941
the hip will drop,

401
00:19:07.941 --> 00:19:11.333
and then the legs will actually become closer

402
00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:13.581
to almost perfectly even.

403
00:19:14.782 --> 00:19:17.066
But again that has to do a lot with the individual.

404
00:19:17.066 --> 00:19:18.410
Some people have had surgery,

405
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.435
some people have had disks removed.

406
00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:21.310
<v ->Or fused.</v>

407
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.570
<v ->They're fused,</v>

408
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.196
and so whether that will ever regain 100% normality,

409
00:19:27.196 --> 00:19:29.864
or whatever normal is really.

410
00:19:29.864 --> 00:19:30.803
It's hard to say,

411
00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:33.192
and sometimes the physical benefits

412
00:19:33.192 --> 00:19:36.115
and reactions could be a life long thing.

413
00:19:36.115 --> 00:19:38.823
And maybe due to your vigor and vitality,

414
00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:42.663
that has a lot to do with how quickly you regenerate.

415
00:19:42.663 --> 00:19:44.199
But typically, physically,

416
00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:46.931
you can have a feeling of spaciousness.

417
00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:51.931
The pressure is released off the base of the skill,

418
00:19:52.156 --> 00:19:54.715
and you just have a feeling of freedom.

419
00:19:56.045 --> 00:19:57.814
Now going to the emotional thing,

420
00:19:57.814 --> 00:20:00.269
what people have told me about,

421
00:20:00.269 --> 00:20:02.523
is that it's helped them get through emotional...

422
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.773
Trying times in their lives.

423
00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:09.928
It brings up anger, it brings up sadness.

424
00:20:09.928 --> 00:20:13.044
I've had feedback from clients

425
00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:15.260
that became very angry,

426
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.190
they expressed anger for days.

427
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.660
And then I've had people tell me they wept like babies.

428
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.397
But all of that being very cathartic,

429
00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:25.237
and all that being very healing for them.

430
00:20:25.237 --> 00:20:28.736
And this work seems to bring out

431
00:20:28.736 --> 00:20:30.185
what this person needs,

432
00:20:30.185 --> 00:20:32.937
or gives them what they need

433
00:20:32.937 --> 00:20:36.288
for whatever thing they're going through.

434
00:20:36.288 --> 00:20:38.912
Then I recently had a call from a man

435
00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:41.380
that didn't come to me with any physical problems,

436
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.572
has felt good, middle aged gentleman.

437
00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:47.644
And he came for a more spiritual awakening,

438
00:20:47.644 --> 00:20:50.799
and his atlas was not far off, but it was out.

439
00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:55.556
But he had tremendous shifts as a body worker himself,

440
00:20:55.556 --> 00:20:58.535
he was feeling his hands getting hotter

441
00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:00.178
during his sessions,

442
00:21:00.178 --> 00:21:04.059
greater sense of energy flow in his body.

443
00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:05.504
A feeling that...

444
00:21:06.854 --> 00:21:09.882
Feeling optimistic in his life.

445
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:14.603
Self actualization is a big thing,

446
00:21:14.603 --> 00:21:17.888
feeling a little more confident.

447
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.020
<v ->It makes sense,</v>

448
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.644
I mean once you start releasing that amount of energy

449
00:21:22.644 --> 00:21:24.861
and allowing for it to flow freely,

450
00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:26.868
I guess it could touch any aspect of life.

451
00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:27.849
And by the way,

452
00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:29.903
that sound in the background which I'll just mention

453
00:21:29.903 --> 00:21:32.931
'cause I'm sure that our viewers will be hearing it

454
00:21:32.931 --> 00:21:34.639
are the cicadas here.

455
00:21:34.639 --> 00:21:36.698
Just a beautiful Page Springs area.

456
00:21:36.698 --> 00:21:37.850
Lot of wild critters,

457
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.986
and some quarrelsome little bugs out there right now.

458
00:21:42.116 --> 00:21:45.018
Also one can get really tired I understand sometimes

459
00:21:45.018 --> 00:21:46.765
in the beginning of the healing process,

460
00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.598
you have to kind of allow for that.

461
00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:50.406
Can you talk a little bit about

462
00:21:50.406 --> 00:21:51.450
how that might show itself,

463
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.350
and how long it might take?

464
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.059
<v ->Well one client said she slept for four days.</v>

465
00:21:56.059 --> 00:21:57.167
<v ->Okay (laughs).</v>

466
00:21:57.167 --> 00:22:02.139
<v ->But to me, and then further investigating her life,</v>

467
00:22:02.139 --> 00:22:04.099
and what was happening at that time.

468
00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:07.131
She was going through a career move,

469
00:22:07.131 --> 00:22:09.243
she was selling a home,

470
00:22:09.243 --> 00:22:11.310
she was exhausted from the pressures

471
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.467
of her work environment.

472
00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:15.387
She needed to rest.

473
00:22:15.387 --> 00:22:16.515
And then I had a woman call me

474
00:22:16.515 --> 00:22:18.030
that she couldn't sleep at night,

475
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.907
she had so much energy from the treatment,

476
00:22:19.907 --> 00:22:22.491
that she got a whole lot done around her house

477
00:22:22.491 --> 00:22:24.785
but she was exhausted because she couldn't sleep

478
00:22:24.785 --> 00:22:26.595
because of the energy.

479
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.334
But typically people feel tired,

480
00:22:28.334 --> 00:22:31.724
and that's kind of a generic way to tell somebody,

481
00:22:31.724 --> 00:22:33.537
take it easy, there's been a shift here.

482
00:22:33.537 --> 00:22:35.865
Whether you're aware of it or not,

483
00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:39.340
and as subtle or as sensitive as this work

484
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.324
can be for some people.

485
00:22:41.324 --> 00:22:43.131
Just take it easy,

486
00:22:43.131 --> 00:22:47.242
and just be allowing to what is gonna come up from this.

487
00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:48.764
And if you need to sleep for a couple days,

488
00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:50.449
allow that to happen.

489
00:22:50.449 --> 00:22:53.545
But again when I was installed,

490
00:22:53.545 --> 00:22:56.425
I'm very active and doing my body work

491
00:22:56.425 --> 00:22:58.896
and raising kids and everything.

492
00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.539
There's no time to sleep, but I was fine with that.

493
00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:04.564
And that was just my history.

494
00:23:04.564 --> 00:23:06.558
But some people do feel tired,

495
00:23:06.558 --> 00:23:08.670
they feel lightheaded,

496
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.459
they can feel dizzy as we're working

497
00:23:10.459 --> 00:23:13.381
with the neurology of the organism.

498
00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:15.886
There's a lot of things that can come up from that.

499
00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:16.996
So yeah that's a common thing.

500
00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:17.693
Which is great,

501
00:23:17.693 --> 00:23:20.789
I think we all need to rest a little bit more.

502
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:22.600
<v ->Well it would seem logically</v>

503
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.632
that this should be taught almost ordinarily

504
00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:29.201
in chiropractic school for example.

505
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:32.593
Are more chiropractors coming into this awareness,

506
00:23:32.593 --> 00:23:35.511
and can we see a time in the future

507
00:23:35.511 --> 00:23:38.487
where most chiropractors will understand this,

508
00:23:38.487 --> 00:23:41.087
and have that included in their practice as well?

509
00:23:42.072 --> 00:23:44.256
<v ->That's the hope, I would hope so.</v>

510
00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.836
And I think there's a lot of very open chiropractors

511
00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:50.484
that have moved away from the typical experience

512
00:23:50.484 --> 00:23:52.205
that most people get, and...

513
00:23:55.176 --> 00:23:56.979
<v ->So let's hope, it's not there yet,</v>

514
00:23:56.979 --> 00:23:59.641
because it sounds like it's still fairly new in the U.S.

515
00:23:59.641 --> 00:24:01.014
<v ->It is, but it...</v>

516
00:24:02.492 --> 00:24:04.368
It's almost like it's a taboo thing.

517
00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:06.076
Like oh let's not mess with the atlas,

518
00:24:06.076 --> 00:24:08.218
because God, you can get paralyzed.

519
00:24:08.218 --> 00:24:10.945
And one little slip of the atlas

520
00:24:10.945 --> 00:24:12.417
and you can have permanent damage.

521
00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:15.745
I almost feel like it's a liability,

522
00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:19.053
fear based resistance to the atlas work.

523
00:24:19.053 --> 00:24:22.957
Where it's only designated for neurosurgeons

524
00:24:22.957 --> 00:24:26.625
who go in from the front and adjust the atlas

525
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:29.293
to relieve the pressure there.

526
00:24:29.293 --> 00:24:32.769
I think it's a much more grassroots simple procedure,

527
00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:37.121
and the overwhelmingly positive response from this work

528
00:24:37.121 --> 00:24:39.873
is that I feel like it can be incorporated

529
00:24:39.873 --> 00:24:42.241
into regular chiropractic work.

530
00:24:42.241 --> 00:24:44.716
And it needs to be the cornerstone

531
00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:47.532
of spinal health in my opinion.

532
00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:50.732
I have a friend who just went ten sessions

533
00:24:50.732 --> 00:24:53.982
of rolfing to deal with her neck problems

534
00:24:53.982 --> 00:24:55.070
and her back problems,

535
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.958
and after ten sessions she feels her body's out again.

536
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:00.939
For her I would have said,

537
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:04.606
hey you need to get your atlas in first,

538
00:25:04.606 --> 00:25:06.590
so that the muscles can be open enough

539
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.494
to receive further chiropractic treatment.

540
00:25:09.494 --> 00:25:12.438
I think chiropractic treatment is vital,

541
00:25:12.438 --> 00:25:14.334
and I think it's very important.

542
00:25:14.334 --> 00:25:16.662
But to neglect the atlas

543
00:25:16.662 --> 00:25:20.414
like I feel that a lot of chiropractors do,

544
00:25:20.414 --> 00:25:22.334
at least with my own experiences,

545
00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:24.246
the few people that I have seen,

546
00:25:24.246 --> 00:25:25.950
they don't talk about the atlas,

547
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.174
they don't palpate it, they don't even think about it.

548
00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:31.242
And they start from the bottom up.

549
00:25:32.784 --> 00:25:34.256
Depending on the chiropractor of course,

550
00:25:34.256 --> 00:25:38.313
but lower lumbar to the thoracic, then up to the cervical.

551
00:25:38.313 --> 00:25:39.585
And if the atlas is out,

552
00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:41.923
try to imagine when you're winding up...

553
00:25:42.934 --> 00:25:45.577
An extension cord that's plugged in or something,

554
00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:48.329
and it's in the socket, and it gets taught.

555
00:25:48.329 --> 00:25:51.445
Or a hose that is full of water still,

556
00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:52.386
you haven't released the pressure

557
00:25:52.386 --> 00:25:54.306
and you're trying to wind it up

558
00:25:54.306 --> 00:25:56.270
or manipulate it,

559
00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.411
and it starts to create tension along the path.

560
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:02.586
And then what happens is once you leave the office,

561
00:26:02.586 --> 00:26:05.530
it unravels back to the position

562
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.746
and the luxation of the atlas.

563
00:26:07.746 --> 00:26:09.538
So again I feel like that needs to be--

564
00:26:09.538 --> 00:26:11.930
<v ->So really the foundational part is not--</v>

565
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.038
<v ->Well it doesn't make sense,</v>

566
00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:14.638
it's the uppermost bone,

567
00:26:14.638 --> 00:26:18.050
and it guards and assures an opening

568
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.654
of the foramen magnum where all

569
00:26:20.654 --> 00:26:22.382
of the ascending and descending nerve tracks

570
00:26:22.382 --> 00:26:24.524
are running through, it's like this is important.

571
00:26:25.758 --> 00:26:26.702
<v ->And beyond that you're talking</v>

572
00:26:26.702 --> 00:26:28.678
acupuncture meridians and such as well,

573
00:26:28.678 --> 00:26:30.982
all of the energy and chi flows go through there.

574
00:26:30.982 --> 00:26:33.094
<v ->Our whole relationship to the world</v>

575
00:26:33.094 --> 00:26:35.631
is running through that column.

576
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:38.765
It's vital and I do feel like it's gonna shift.

577
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:43.207
We had these two lovely chiropractors come the other day,

578
00:26:43.207 --> 00:26:45.491
and one of them was the scoliotic patient

579
00:26:45.491 --> 00:26:48.287
that we were discussing in particular,

580
00:26:48.287 --> 00:26:51.954
and her partner was just completely open to it,

581
00:26:51.954 --> 00:26:53.111
and he was wonderful.

582
00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.155
<v ->I know who you're talking about,</v>

583
00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:55.307
is he going to take the training?

584
00:26:55.307 --> 00:26:57.119
<v ->I hope so, he was interested in doing it,</v>

585
00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:59.319
and I do feel like the chiropractor's gonna go for it,

586
00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:02.794
because I feel like subconsciously they know

587
00:27:02.794 --> 00:27:04.927
that they don't want to keep seeing these people again.

588
00:27:04.927 --> 00:27:07.423
They really do wanna heal them

589
00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:09.578
and see them on their way,

590
00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:12.095
and kind of get them out of their office,

591
00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:13.719
and maybe come back in a month or so.

592
00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:16.746
But I've had clients come to me

593
00:27:16.746 --> 00:27:18.538
getting neck cracked once a week,

594
00:27:18.538 --> 00:27:22.153
and I'm just going, there's something wrong here.

595
00:27:23.244 --> 00:27:26.742
To have that kind of tension and twerking

596
00:27:26.742 --> 00:27:29.782
on the spine once a week?

597
00:27:29.782 --> 00:27:32.856
And then having a lot of the atlas folks

598
00:27:32.856 --> 00:27:35.236
need to take x-rays all the time.

599
00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:37.541
But x-rays don't give you an idea

600
00:27:37.541 --> 00:27:39.541
of their emotional state...

601
00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:43.176
Or the tension in the muscle structure.

602
00:27:43.176 --> 00:27:46.770
It doesn't give you an idea of their personal history,

603
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.582
or what's going on energetically or emotionally.

604
00:27:49.582 --> 00:27:53.175
So again I think we are seeing one side of the picture,

605
00:27:53.175 --> 00:27:55.894
and I feel like this is gonna open up.

606
00:27:57.028 --> 00:28:00.220
A lot of people are calling me about reversing the curse,

607
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.292
and a lot of people just tend to be gravitating

608
00:28:02.292 --> 00:28:04.252
towards this work because of

609
00:28:04.252 --> 00:28:08.948
just wanting mostly on a spiritual path that they're on.

610
00:28:08.948 --> 00:28:11.925
<v ->Right, wanting to be truly open again to all the forces.</v>

611
00:28:11.925 --> 00:28:13.373
<v ->To feel their abundance,</v>

612
00:28:13.373 --> 00:28:17.621
to feel everything that's coming in and going out.

613
00:28:17.621 --> 00:28:20.181
<v ->Yes, well any final thoughts on it?</v>

614
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:21.353
Anything we have not covered?

615
00:28:21.353 --> 00:28:23.582
Because that's a lot of good information.

616
00:28:23.582 --> 00:28:25.163
<v ->I feel like I spoke a lot.</v>

617
00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:27.254
<v ->I think so, I think we've got it,</v>

618
00:28:27.254 --> 00:28:29.858
so I just want to thank you so much for your time.

619
00:28:29.858 --> 00:28:30.882
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

620
00:28:30.882 --> 00:28:32.722
<v ->I hope many people watch this</v>

621
00:28:32.722 --> 00:28:36.026
and start seeking help in this way.

622
00:28:36.026 --> 00:28:38.695
And more chiropractors and healing practitioners

623
00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:41.447
taking this on as well, it really takes above, doesn't it?

624
00:28:41.447 --> 00:28:43.794
<v ->It does, and I would say just one last thing,</v>

625
00:28:43.794 --> 00:28:46.886
it's very important to tune into our intuition.

626
00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:48.870
And to know what is right for our bodies,

627
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.870
and not get too overloaded by fancy medical terms,

628
00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:57.268
and pathologies, and things that our...

629
00:28:58.386 --> 00:29:01.522
Traditional healthcare system wants to throw on us,

630
00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:03.826
and I feel like we have tremendous amount

631
00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:06.642
of vitality still to self heal,

632
00:29:06.642 --> 00:29:08.646
and to self regenerate,

633
00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:10.418
and I think that's what's gonna empower us

634
00:29:10.418 --> 00:29:13.289
for the things to come and the shifts

635
00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:15.401
that I think are happening in our lives,

636
00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:17.301
and we all feel it,

637
00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:21.495
that we have now the ability to reset,

638
00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:24.183
to start again with a corrected atlas,

639
00:29:24.183 --> 00:29:27.746
and to self heal and be in control of our spine

640
00:29:27.746 --> 00:29:29.386
and how it feels,

641
00:29:29.386 --> 00:29:32.828
and to have a little more self empowerment.

642
00:29:33.987 --> 00:29:35.237
I think that's important.

643
00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:39.408

of atlas installation for yourself.

649
00:29:50.947 --> 00:29:52.949
Until next time, thanks for watching.
