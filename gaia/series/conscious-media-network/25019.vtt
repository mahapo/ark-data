00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:03.633
(gentle instrumental music)

2
00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.041
<v ->With all of the grand events that seem to be playing out</v>

3
00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.337
across the world, we met up, once again, with Jessica Murray

4
00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:20.918
to see how the stars point to the opportunities

5
00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:23.126
embedded within the challenges.

6
00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.494
Our conversation about the astrological chart

7
00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:28.395
of the United States has been the focus of our discourse,

8
00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.616
and each stage has come to pass with the great challenge

9
00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:34.571
and opportunities still laying ahead.

10
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:36.405
Relax and dial into this one.

11
00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:40.548
We go deeper and deeper as the interview progresses.

12
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.335
<v Regina>It's been a little over a year</v>

13
00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:51.871
since we last chatted.

14
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:54.655
When we did, I think it was right after the downturn

15
00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.001
in the economy, and it was just about

16
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.711
the time of Obama's election.

17
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.684
What we were focusing on at that time,

18
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:05.129
was Saturn-Uranus opposition that was going on

19
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.627
that you say is continuing until July of this year.

20
00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:10.878
Just to kind of give us a reference point

21
00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:13.758
from where we were, how that has been playing out

22
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:16.179
according to what you saw back then,

23
00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.197
up until what happens through July on that.

24
00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:21.448
We'll finish that off and then go into some new stuff,

25
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.954
but I just want to pick up where we left off.

26
00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:26.994
<v ->The Saturn-Uranus opposition</v>

27
00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:31.058
is one of the arms of the T-square,

28
00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:35.772
which is moving into the grand cross in cardinal signs.

29
00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:37.447
<v Regina>And again, explain all that.</v>

30
00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:41.020
<v ->I will, but you know, the thing that you hear about</v>

31
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.265
when you hear about 2012, according to western astrology,

32
00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:49.723
is really talking about the cardinal T-square,

33
00:01:49.723 --> 00:01:53.414
which includes the Saturn-Uranus opposition.

34
00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:55.718
You could say that opposition we talked about last time

35
00:01:55.718 --> 00:02:00.718
is kind of its spine, and it's a two year chunk

36
00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.517
of a big series of configurations

37
00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:07.536
which have a lot of moving parts.

38
00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:11.205
It's so complex, which is why it's such a big deal.

39
00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:12.943
That and its rarity.

40
00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:15.334
The Saturn-Uranus opposition we've already

41
00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.747
had our big taste of,

42
00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:23.747
and, in essence, it governs the tendency

43
00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:28.896
of entrenched, fearful of change

44
00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:32.591
institutions, if you look at it on a collective level.

45
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.386
It means all those agencies and people,

46
00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:36.911
and groups that don't want to change.

47
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:37.913
<v Regina>Paralyzed.</v>

48
00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:39.631
<v ->They're hunkering down,</v>

49
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:44.631
and they're opposed to Uranus, which governs, really,

50
00:02:44.857 --> 00:02:49.518
the force of ideas whose time have come.

51
00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:52.824
That we've seen all along,

52
00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:55.768
I mean, since Obama was elected.

53
00:02:55.768 --> 00:03:00.483
We've seen it act out in the form of

54
00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:03.160
any kind of reform that tried to happen

55
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.477
was squelched through these almost hysterically

56
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:11.287
obdurate filibustering parts of society.

57
00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:13.399
I think about the U.S. chart mostly,

58
00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.695
because it's what I study, am closest with.

59
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:19.693
We looked at where in the U.S. chart

60
00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:21.485
Saturn and Uranus were opposing.

61
00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:22.882
We've had Saturn on the midheaven,

62
00:03:22.882 --> 00:03:27.010
which governs the presidency, and leadership,

63
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.357
and our face in the world.

64
00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:31.767
We've had that going on and then, little by little,

65
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:36.066
these other pieces of the cardinal cross

66
00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:39.041
have been slipping into gear.

67
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.145
One of the pieces of the Saturn-Uranus opposition

68
00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:47.145
that is a main theme, star of the show,

69
00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:51.916
is Pluto having moved into Capricorn.

70
00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:52.727
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

71
00:03:52.727 --> 00:03:55.011
<v ->Which had happened right around the time we talked last.</v>

72
00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:55.918
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

73
00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:59.117
<v ->Which astrologers mostly chalk up</v>

74
00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:02.232
the financial global collapse to that,

75
00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:05.314
because Pluto is complete destruction.

76
00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:06.893
<v Regina>Yet, at the same time, we're seeing</v>

77
00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:10.583
the entrenchment happening, as with the banking industry,

78
00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:15.063
for example, trying to hang on by frayed fingernails

79
00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:16.812
to the old way.

80
00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:19.831
Again, this re-entrenchment into greed

81
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:23.542
at an insane level.

82
00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:28.118
<v ->It was Michael Moore who said that greed became legalized.</v>

83
00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:29.622
<v Regina>Yes, greed became legalized.</v>

84
00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:30.763
<v ->Over the past few years.</v>

85
00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:34.904
We had this, this was the preview to what's going on now.

86
00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Regina>Yes, and we're going to get into that,</v>

87
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.237
so is there anything else about that from then

88
00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:41.709
that you want to continue on?

89
00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:43.468
Or should we just jump into --

90
00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:46.478
<v ->Well, you know, you can't really understand the Saturn,</v>

91
00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:49.517
which has just now moved into Libra,

92
00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:53.997
opposing Uranus, which is just about to move into Aries.

93
00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.618
<v Regina>What's that mean?</v>

94
00:04:55.618 --> 00:05:00.077
<v ->Well, both of these signs are making ingresses.</v>

95
00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:03.404
Both of these planets are making sign changes,

96
00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:06.028
and that is sort of like they're clicking into gear,

97
00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:10.529
one step further into the big 2012 placements

98
00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.599
that I'm calling the cardinal T-square.

99
00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.732
<v Regina>Okay, now if we haven't dealt well</v>

100
00:05:14.732 --> 00:05:17.238
with where the positions were before,

101
00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:19.766
in terms of, as you say, this re-entrenchment into old ways

102
00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.259
instead of flowing into the new.

103
00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.582
<v Regina>Shall I define them?</v>

104
00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:23.947
<v ->Then what does this mean?</v>

105
00:05:23.947 --> 00:05:25.942
What does this mean if we haven't done our part

106
00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:27.776
in reaction to the times?

107
00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:31.750
<v ->Well, it's an interesting question because</v>

108
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.537
this is just the beginning of the intensity.

109
00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:41.814
To the extent that each of these little milestones

110
00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:44.224
that this whole configuration, which is really

111
00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:47.851
a series of configurations and not just one thing.

112
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:52.525
Each little move towards the peaks of the 2012 years,

113
00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:56.354
which I'll define in a minute,

114
00:05:56.354 --> 00:06:01.153
has a job of separating the sheep from the goats, i think.

115
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:04.663
Each one of them makes it more and more clear

116
00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:07.404
that we can either get out of denial

117
00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:12.235
and step up to what's happening,

118
00:06:12.235 --> 00:06:13.622
and get clearer,

119
00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:18.622
and live through our charts, or not.

120
00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:21.984
I think the "or not" thing is going to be

121
00:06:21.984 --> 00:06:26.984
making life very hard for people, a lot of people.

122
00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:31.274
<v Regina>Essentially, we can choose to not step up,</v>

123
00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:33.365
but if we do, it's going to become

124
00:06:33.365 --> 00:06:36.031
increasingly uncomfortable in our experience?

125
00:06:36.031 --> 00:06:37.706
<v ->I think it's going to be exciting.</v>

126
00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:40.607
When people step up, what they're going to do is,

127
00:06:40.607 --> 00:06:42.455
they're going to realize that there are aspects

128
00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:43.980
of their own individual charts

129
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.372
which have been waiting all their lives for that.

130
00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:48.812
This is my take on it.

131
00:06:48.812 --> 00:06:51.457
This is kind of a humanistic astrology take on it,

132
00:06:51.457 --> 00:06:56.457
which doesn't really see things quite the same way

133
00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:59.777
as the Vedic astrologers,

134
00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:02.347
or the more prediction-oriented astrologers.

135
00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:07.019
We see life being created at every moment.

136
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:10.315
If you consider that what you have to work with

137
00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:13.792
is all in coded form in your individual chart,

138
00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:15.818
then you realize that your only job, really,

139
00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:17.951
is to pay attention to the moment

140
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:19.690
and use what you've already got,

141
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.919
which will feel like instinct,

142
00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.543
it'll feel like a natural impulse to do so.

143
00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:27.337
If you're in the present moment.

144
00:07:27.337 --> 00:07:30.441
you'll be told what to do.

145
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.969
I mean, you'll be told by your inner self what to do.

146
00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:36.671
We'll call it living through the chart.

147
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:40.897
I think this is another interesting

148
00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:44.523
place to put in that a lot of people are asking,

149
00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:46.198
consciousness seekers are asking,

150
00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:51.198
"But what will I do when the 2012 energies

151
00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:55.488
"really start to climb and climb and climb,

152
00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:57.386
"really through 2016?"

153
00:07:57.386 --> 00:07:58.901
<v Regina>We're going to work through that.</v>

154
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:01.802
We'll work through that, but I just thought we'd --

155
00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:04.191
<v ->But I wanted to say one thing about that, if I may.</v>

156
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.646
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:08.788
<v ->You don't have to do anything but live through your chart.</v>

158
00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.249
You don't have to do anything but show up

159
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:13.504
to who you already are.

160
00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:18.504
I think that the business of doing is

161
00:08:18.892 --> 00:08:20.684
not really where it's at.

162
00:08:20.684 --> 00:08:22.817
It's about being.

163
00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:25.238
It's about being your chart, which is an astrologist's way

164
00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:27.190
of saying, being yourself,

165
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.910
and using all the resources at your disposal.

166
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.862
But I just wanted to put this in,

167
00:08:31.862 --> 00:08:35.499
because there's kind of an understandable

168
00:08:35.499 --> 00:08:40.192
fear and desperation, even among consciousness seekers,

169
00:08:40.192 --> 00:08:45.192
about how can I show up for this world-altering phase,

170
00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:48.003
this epoch that they've heard so much about.

171
00:08:48.003 --> 00:08:52.698
The answer is, don't really worry about doing.

172
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.244
Just be your chart.

173
00:08:54.244 --> 00:08:55.994
You've got all of the ingredients already.

174
00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Regina>Which means, live by your instincts.</v>

175
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.609
<v ->It does.</v>

176
00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:01.220
Instincts is a big word, which we might

177
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.492
have to explain a little bit,

178
00:09:03.492 --> 00:09:06.628
because, of course, various people use it in different ways.

179
00:09:06.628 --> 00:09:10.809
In this context, I mean that those strong impulses,

180
00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:15.267
when you're in the moment, that are already there,

181
00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:18.680
are your purest guide for why you even decided

182
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.543
on a soul level to show up at this time.

183
00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:24.889
That's the big assumption, isn't it?

184
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:29.889
That's what's axiomatic in humanistic astrology, is that

185
00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:33.177
we did all decide on some level to show up right now.

186
00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.412
<v Regina>We made this choice.</v>

187
00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:39.780
Let's go into some of what you're looking at now,

188
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.260
which is the whole, I think it's the Uranus-Pluto,

189
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.927
I'm still in the old way of saying it,

190
00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:49.533
Uranus-Pluto square, 2012, and all of the, really,

191
00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:52.392
paradigm shifts that we're going to be looking for

192
00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.920
that have been spoken about in many ways

193
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.423
through many different lenses,

194
00:09:56.423 --> 00:09:59.538
whether it's the Mayan calendar or what-not.

195
00:09:59.538 --> 00:10:02.119
But you're looking at it through an astrological lens,

196
00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:05.138
so let's talk about some of those trends

197
00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:07.665
that we should be looking at.

198
00:10:07.665 --> 00:10:12.380
<v ->I think that when western astrology talks about 2012,</v>

199
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.422
mostly people mean the seven exact hits

200
00:10:16.422 --> 00:10:19.558
of Uranus square Pluto,

201
00:10:19.558 --> 00:10:24.558
which go from the middle of 2012 until 2016.

202
00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:28.976
We would consider that a peak time,

203
00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:32.252
but even within that peak time, there are peaks.

204
00:10:32.252 --> 00:10:35.825
If you were to graph it, it would look like this.

205
00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:38.449
People who really track their transits

206
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:40.444
want to know when those peaks are,

207
00:10:40.444 --> 00:10:42.492
and they want to know how they overlie

208
00:10:42.492 --> 00:10:44.567
with their own charts.

209
00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:48.448
That's where astrology can get into a lot of detail.

210
00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:52.203
<v Regina>Okay, let's start with 2012 in terms of,</v>

211
00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:56.298
are there some significant peaks within 2012

212
00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:57.546
with this particular --

213
00:10:57.546 --> 00:11:02.546
<v ->The first one is that first hit of Uranus square Pluto,</v>

214
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.202
and I think that that would be the strongest arm

215
00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:09.695
of the cross.

216
00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:13.151
It's the one between the two slowest moving planets,

217
00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:17.054
so they have that much more gravitas.

218
00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:21.694
Those transits in general, which are the slowest,

219
00:11:21.694 --> 00:11:24.137
happen the least frequently, are the ones

220
00:11:24.137 --> 00:11:26.707
that are considered the most profound.

221
00:11:26.707 --> 00:11:31.707
We're talking about world-altering energies

222
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:34.440
confronting each other.

223
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.693
I think we talked about, last time, how

224
00:11:37.693 --> 00:11:41.874
the last time that Uranus and Pluto

225
00:11:41.874 --> 00:11:44.423
had this kind of a fraught coming together

226
00:11:44.423 --> 00:11:46.162
was in the mid '60s,

227
00:11:46.162 --> 00:11:49.212
and we remember what happened then.

228
00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:54.212
That's another way that astrologers look ahead,

229
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.821
even though we don't,

230
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:00.840
I don't like to predict.

231
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.999
I do look at what's coming energetically,

232
00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:08.786
and I look at the fact that we were in this waning square

233
00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:11.228
of Uranus and Pluto, and now we're in the --

234
00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:15.079
I'm sorry, we were in the conjunction of it in '65, '66,

235
00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:19.068
as a world, and we had these consciousness movements

236
00:12:19.068 --> 00:12:20.604
exploding all over the place.

237
00:12:20.604 --> 00:12:22.971
We had assassinations and violence,

238
00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:27.846
but we also had revolutions of consciousness with people.

239
00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:32.048
Now, we're coming to their first square since then.

240
00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:33.787
It's a development, you see,

241
00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:38.787
if you look at history, in terms of an unfolding.

242
00:12:39.856 --> 00:12:42.085
You can also look at the fact that,

243
00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:44.709
I know this is complex, but this is all the layers

244
00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:48.911
that are going on, the planet Jupiter,

245
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:51.578
which is a relatively quickly moving planet

246
00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:53.924
compared to these big guys.

247
00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:58.276
Jupiter will be conjuncting Uranus this summer.

248
00:12:58.276 --> 00:12:59.321
<v Regina>What's the mean?</v>

249
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:01.177
I'll be saying this to everything, "What's that mean?"

250
00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:03.172
<v ->Yes, and I'm going to try to get there,</v>

251
00:13:03.172 --> 00:13:05.987
but I want to give the backdrop of reminding us

252
00:13:05.987 --> 00:13:08.889
that all of these have a different kind of veilance.

253
00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.736
Jupiter's almost like a second hand of a clock

254
00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:14.808
compared to the Uranus-Pluto thing we were talking about,

255
00:13:14.808 --> 00:13:16.728
which is the hour hand.

256
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:22.009
Again, using the idea of, what did it do last time?

257
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:25.070
The last time Jupiter and Uranus were doing

258
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.321
something like this on a cardinal point,

259
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:29.507
which they will be now,

260
00:13:29.507 --> 00:13:32.251
was the summer of the Manson murders,

261
00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:33.574
<v Regina>I remember, yes.</v>

262
00:13:33.574 --> 00:13:37.480
<v ->Woodstock, and the moon walk.</v>

263
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.314
<v Regina>Mixed bag.</v>

264
00:13:39.314 --> 00:13:41.543
<v ->Well, they're all so grand.</v>

265
00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:42.823
<v Regina>Powerful. Grand.</v>

266
00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:44.167
<v ->They're all so dramatic.</v>

267
00:13:44.167 --> 00:13:47.090
They're all so world-altering.

268
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.372
They're game-changing.

269
00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:54.372
It's that idea of game-changing-ness that you look at,

270
00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:56.867
when you consider Jupiter and Uranus

271
00:13:56.867 --> 00:13:59.256
are doing their thing.

272
00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:01.464
Jupiter just went last night into Pisces.

273
00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:03.789
It's going to whip through Pisces

274
00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:05.943
and it's going to meet up with Uranus,

275
00:14:05.943 --> 00:14:10.943
which goes into Aries in late May and June.

276
00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:14.679
June 26th there's going to be a full moon.

277
00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:18.113
I'm looking at May and June as kind of a,

278
00:14:18.113 --> 00:14:21.313
the first of the grand explosions.

279
00:14:21.313 --> 00:14:22.710
<v Regina>When you say grand explosions,</v>

280
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.054
what does that mean?

281
00:14:24.054 --> 00:14:27.745
<v ->Let's go back to the Saturn-Uranus opposition,</v>

282
00:14:27.745 --> 00:14:32.043
which was the idea of

283
00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:33.835
energies that don't want to change

284
00:14:33.835 --> 00:14:36.384
and which are hanging on for dear life,

285
00:14:36.384 --> 00:14:41.384
opposed to explosive newness which can't not change,

286
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.024
and invention.

287
00:14:45.024 --> 00:14:47.178
<v Regina>The pressure is excruciating.</v>

288
00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:47.651
<v ->Yeah.</v>

289
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:49.167
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Jessica>Yeah.</v>

290
00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:52.140
It isn't that Saturn has to take this

291
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.505
low level of expression.

292
00:14:53.505 --> 00:14:55.639
Let's go back later and talk about the ways

293
00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:59.863
that we want to use it, but what we've seen so far,

294
00:14:59.863 --> 00:15:01.623
and what we can expect when when we think of

295
00:15:01.623 --> 00:15:03.554
the pressure that you talk about,

296
00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:06.711
is that Jupiter will join Uranus.

297
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:08.033
It's like if you have a see-saw

298
00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:11.448
and one more kid gets on that other end.

299
00:15:11.448 --> 00:15:14.509
Jupiter exaggerates what it touches,

300
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:18.666
and it's touching the planet of invention and explosion.

301
00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:21.493
Saturn might be left up here like the kid

302
00:15:21.493 --> 00:15:25.302
with her legs kicking in the air.

303
00:15:25.302 --> 00:15:28.577
This is the way the balance is going to fall.

304
00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:33.577
It's not going to be possible for the reactionary forces

305
00:15:35.423 --> 00:15:38.420
to keep on the same tack

306
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.089
when Jupiter and Uranus conjoin this spring and summer.

307
00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:43.465
Something's got to give.

308
00:15:43.465 --> 00:15:46.462
<v Regina>Well, let's get into one specific,</v>

309
00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:49.054
because this same period of time

310
00:15:49.054 --> 00:15:51.539
keeps coming up in economic circles

311
00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:55.464
as another likely downturn,

312
00:15:55.464 --> 00:16:00.317
or certainly destabilization of what's happening now,

313
00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:03.175
which is already fairly destabilized.

314
00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:05.543
I mean, you don't see that, when we talked before,

315
00:16:05.543 --> 00:16:08.007
you said, in 2008, which it was.

316
00:16:08.007 --> 00:16:10.967
It was what, September, October of 2008

317
00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:13.409
is when started seeing the real tumble in the economy.

318
00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:16.214
We're now looking at some of the spun-off effects from that

319
00:16:16.214 --> 00:16:18.764
which haven't really even gained speed yet.

320
00:16:18.764 --> 00:16:21.302
We're just seeing the beginning of the passed on

321
00:16:21.302 --> 00:16:23.595
effects of that, but you're saying,

322
00:16:23.595 --> 00:16:26.710
with these various aspects, we're looking at

323
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.472
something even more powerful happening by summer,

324
00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:31.701
as the people in the world of economics are saying.

325
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.371
How do you see that expressing itself from here, then,

326
00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:38.037
just looking at economics alone?

327
00:16:38.037 --> 00:16:42.655
<v ->Well, I see the economic downturn as a symbol.</v>

328
00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:45.173
I see everything as a symbol.

329
00:16:45.173 --> 00:16:48.074
If you look at the constituents of this symbol,

330
00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:51.604
you see Pluto, which governs destruction and break down

331
00:16:51.604 --> 00:16:55.380
in the sign of monetary systems, which is Capricorn.

332
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.765
It was right when it had ingressed into that placement

333
00:16:58.765 --> 00:16:59.991
that we had the first --

334
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:02.082
<v Regina>It was right on, yeah.</v>

335
00:17:02.082 --> 00:17:06.636
<v ->Now, we have that placement backed up by Uranus,</v>

336
00:17:06.636 --> 00:17:11.636
which is the intensity that comes of the future trying to

337
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.485
bring forth, in an evolutionary way,

338
00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:19.821
some sets of conditions.

339
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:24.821
For example, enlightenment among the people.

340
00:17:25.006 --> 00:17:28.216
I smile when I say that because it sounds

341
00:17:28.216 --> 00:17:31.747
like a cliche,

342
00:17:31.747 --> 00:17:33.944
but Uranus really does govern freedom,

343
00:17:33.944 --> 00:17:36.387
and freedom to think.

344
00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:40.866
When it's in Aries, which is the sign of leadership

345
00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:45.282
and invention, you do get a picture

346
00:17:45.282 --> 00:17:48.183
of a whole populace, which is Uranus, the people,

347
00:17:48.183 --> 00:17:52.940
rising up with a kind of an independence of thought.

348
00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.380
What are they squaring?

349
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.705
What are they in conflict with?

350
00:17:56.705 --> 00:17:59.958
They're in conflict with this dying beast

351
00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.924
of an economic system.

352
00:18:02.924 --> 00:18:06.295
Now, I want to say something here because

353
00:18:08.502 --> 00:18:12.960
I do think we have to make the distinction between

354
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.755
the events on the ground, so to speak,

355
00:18:15.755 --> 00:18:20.181
and the symbolic energies that are behind them.

356
00:18:20.181 --> 00:18:23.274
Because I believe, and this is kind of the Tarnas,

357
00:18:23.274 --> 00:18:27.594
Richard Tarnas, school of looking at astrology

358
00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:32.287
as being very precise at predicting archetypes,

359
00:18:32.287 --> 00:18:35.721
but not that good at predicting actual events.

360
00:18:35.721 --> 00:18:38.089
We don't really care about those.

361
00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:40.521
But when you look at the archetypes that are

362
00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:44.446
vying for prominence here, Uranus and Pluto,

363
00:18:44.446 --> 00:18:49.446
you get the feeling that something is trying to

364
00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:52.191
come to group consciousness,

365
00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:55.274
that's been happening all along.

366
00:18:55.274 --> 00:18:59.039
This idea that we've had a federal reserve

367
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.004
which nobody knows, I mean the public

368
00:19:02.004 --> 00:19:03.681
really doesn't have a clue what it's about.

369
00:19:03.681 --> 00:19:05.077
<v Regina>It still doesn't understand this is not</v>

370
00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:07.821
even federal, for starters.

371
00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:08.557
<v ->Right.</v>

372
00:19:08.557 --> 00:19:10.903
The incredible corruption of it, you know.

373
00:19:10.903 --> 00:19:13.410
Bernanke going to lunch with all these guys,

374
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.231
he's supposed to be --

375
00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:16.354
<v Regina>The revolving door of Goldman-Sachs</v>

376
00:19:16.354 --> 00:19:18.743
and so on and so on.

377
00:19:18.743 --> 00:19:23.319
<v ->The fed is just this great monolithic secret,</v>

378
00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:27.681
dark, totally Plutonian symbol.

379
00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:28.961
Let's use it.

380
00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:33.697
It's the perfect symbol for Pluto in Capricorn.

381
00:19:33.697 --> 00:19:36.043
I don't know if there's going to be this massive

382
00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:38.336
breakthrough, where people start asking questions about,

383
00:19:38.336 --> 00:19:40.747
what exactly is the fed?

384
00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:45.747
And why are the same economists that are supposedly

385
00:19:46.283 --> 00:19:49.877
objective, the very ones that are trying to manage

386
00:19:49.877 --> 00:19:52.479
congressional policy about the fed?

387
00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:54.943
Why are they on the fed payroll?

388
00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.023
All of these kinds of things, I imagine,

389
00:19:57.023 --> 00:20:00.724
will start to come up in the public mind,

390
00:20:00.724 --> 00:20:04.457
so that when I say that there's going to be

391
00:20:04.457 --> 00:20:08.638
a new breakthrough, a new explosion

392
00:20:08.638 --> 00:20:13.638
in the financial landscape in the USA,

393
00:20:14.207 --> 00:20:16.810
which starts the whole thing going

394
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.551
in ripple effect throughout the world here,

395
00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:24.236
what I mean is that something's going to burst up

396
00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:27.170
through collective consciousness.

397
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.908
These corruptions have been there,

398
00:20:28.908 --> 00:20:31.233
but they haven't been exposed.

399
00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:34.017
They haven't met that tipping point,

400
00:20:34.017 --> 00:20:38.401
where the mass mind in general gets it.

401
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:41.710
That's what I think astrology's very good at predicting.

402
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.918
For example,

403
00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:47.417
back when Saturn was opposing Neptune,

404
00:20:47.417 --> 00:20:51.950
when Al Gore's wonderful documentary came out,

405
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.755
it wasn't until then that there was something

406
00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:57.315
that broke through that crust,

407
00:20:57.315 --> 00:21:00.376
and this tipping point of the American public

408
00:21:00.376 --> 00:21:03.160
got hip to global warming.

409
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.829
It isn't that people hadn't known about it for a long time,

410
00:21:06.829 --> 00:21:10.220
that scientists hadn't been ready,

411
00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.444
if anybody had asked them, with all kinds of evidence.

412
00:21:14.444 --> 00:21:16.844
It's that it took this tipping point.

413
00:21:16.844 --> 00:21:19.063
That's what I think we're going to be seeing

414
00:21:19.063 --> 00:21:23.297
from the summer on, and it didn't start this summer,

415
00:21:23.297 --> 00:21:25.868
but it's going to be incrementally more intense

416
00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:30.049
with every milestone of this series of peaks,

417
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:31.787
a series of tipping points.

418
00:21:31.787 --> 00:21:33.558
<v Regina>What about, when you speak of tipping points,</v>

419
00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:37.365
what about the notion of conflict,

420
00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:41.824
whether it be domestic or global?

421
00:21:41.824 --> 00:21:43.189
<v ->You mean armed conflict?</v>

422
00:21:43.189 --> 00:21:44.448
<v Regina>Yes, armed conflict.</v>

423
00:21:44.448 --> 00:21:46.976
<v ->Oh, it's absolutely in there,</v>

424
00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:50.293
but, in a way, it too is a symbol,

425
00:21:50.293 --> 00:21:54.922
because the kinds of conflicts that the post-millennial

426
00:21:54.922 --> 00:21:58.015
world is finding itself in, that it doesn't really

427
00:21:58.015 --> 00:22:00.564
have the equipment to deal with,

428
00:22:00.564 --> 00:22:04.446
are such a thing, for example, as a trade war.

429
00:22:04.446 --> 00:22:07.785
It's almost like we don't have the psychic vocabulary

430
00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:12.777
as a group to imagine a trade war

431
00:22:12.777 --> 00:22:15.475
in the same terms that we imagine

432
00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:18.536
taking our drone planes and tanks to Afghanistan.

433
00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:20.275
That's really that second idea.

434
00:22:20.275 --> 00:22:23.976
it's a very old-fashioned way of fighting

435
00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:28.573
the kinds of extreme conflicts, energetic conflicts,

436
00:22:28.573 --> 00:22:31.282
that astrology is talking about.

437
00:22:31.282 --> 00:22:36.282
Since Google has decided to pull out of China --

438
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:37.747
<v Regina>China, yes.</v>

439
00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:39.784
<v ->We don't really know what kind of a conflict,</v>

440
00:22:39.784 --> 00:22:44.784
economic conflict, that's going to cause,

441
00:22:45.085 --> 00:22:47.496
that's going to trigger.

442
00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:49.309
This is the kind of thing I mean.

443
00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:52.861
Most people don't think of conflict in that term.

444
00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:55.719
What does it mean to people who know about it,

445
00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:59.453
who think about it, that the U.S. is in hock to China

446
00:22:59.453 --> 00:23:01.620
for a trillion dollars?

447
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.587
I don't think people think of these terms.

448
00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:08.382
In the same way that in the middle ages,

449
00:23:08.382 --> 00:23:12.385
Tudor England was still trying to fight its wars with France

450
00:23:12.385 --> 00:23:16.726
in the same clunky old equipment that the

451
00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:20.299
grandfathers had fought in the dark ages.

452
00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:23.552
It's the same type of paradigm shift we're seeing here.

453
00:23:23.552 --> 00:23:24.597
Am I making sense?

454
00:23:24.597 --> 00:23:25.802
<v Regina>Yes, yes.</v>

455
00:23:25.802 --> 00:23:27.712
<v ->The energies talk about conflict,</v>

456
00:23:27.712 --> 00:23:29.983
and we have to get hip to the fact

457
00:23:29.983 --> 00:23:31.754
that things are moving way faster --

458
00:23:31.754 --> 00:23:34.026
<v Regina>It doesn't necessarily mean Afghani policy.</v>

459
00:23:34.026 --> 00:23:36.042
Like you said, this could be something

460
00:23:36.042 --> 00:23:39.711
with much more extensive consequences.

461
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:41.801
Just like you say, this one move for Google

462
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:44.681
pulling out of China, for example, and you're right.

463
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:48.030
<v ->People getting hip to the amount of debt we're in.</v>

464
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:53.030
What do ordinary Americans imagine

465
00:23:53.139 --> 00:23:56.968
is really behind the U.S. economy?

466
00:23:56.968 --> 00:24:00.360
Do they understand that their government is broke?

467
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.699
Flat broke, just like they are?

468
00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:06.856
<v Regina>I don't think so, because Bill O'Reilly says,</v>

469
00:24:06.856 --> 00:24:08.925
"We're the wealthiest nation on the planet."

470
00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:10.365
<v ->Okay, so there's your answer.</v>

471
00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:11.474
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

472
00:24:11.474 --> 00:24:15.773
<v ->This is the discontinuity between public reality</v>

473
00:24:15.773 --> 00:24:19.047
and the energetic realities we see in the planets.

474
00:24:19.047 --> 00:24:21.436
<v Regina>But those same people that might be</v>

475
00:24:21.436 --> 00:24:24.924
watching this kind of popular news cast, for example,

476
00:24:24.924 --> 00:24:29.756
spouting off platitudes of America's position in the world,

477
00:24:29.756 --> 00:24:32.070
the very same people also know others who

478
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.206
are losing their homes to foreclosure,

479
00:24:35.206 --> 00:24:37.627
who are losing their jobs and are among

480
00:24:37.627 --> 00:24:39.131
the real numbers of unemployment,

481
00:24:39.131 --> 00:24:43.527
which are much closer to 20% than 10%.

482
00:24:43.527 --> 00:24:45.640
We're talking about denial.

483
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.008
<v ->Yeah, we are talking about denial.</v>

484
00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:51.697
This is where we get the

485
00:24:53.772 --> 00:24:55.863
Aquarius transits come in.

486
00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:58.295
It might be a good way to segue into them.

487
00:24:58.295 --> 00:25:02.136
Neptune governs denial, and in the last couple of years,

488
00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:07.136
there's been kind of a sea change in the group mind,

489
00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:11.492
which I look at in terms of the moon in the Sibley chart,

490
00:25:11.492 --> 00:25:15.833
the USA chart, which was born July 4th, 1776,

491
00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:19.324
and has its own chart

492
00:25:19.324 --> 00:25:23.387
which we track transits towards.

493
00:25:23.387 --> 00:25:27.003
These, if I may say briefly about them,

494
00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:30.213
then I want to go back to this.

495
00:25:30.213 --> 00:25:34.341
Neptune and Chiron together in the sky,

496
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:36.613
as they were all last year for what was called

497
00:25:36.613 --> 00:25:38.053
the super conjunction --

498
00:25:38.053 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

499
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.914
<v ->2009, and next month they're going to be peaking</v>

500
00:25:41.914 --> 00:25:46.116
in a new kind of way, February 16th, 17th, 2010.

501
00:25:46.116 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Regina>What's the opportunity there,</v>

502
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.572
if you don't mind my asking, just a couple bullet points?

503
00:25:49.572 --> 00:25:53.913
<v ->Well, Neptune can be denial,</v>

504
00:25:53.913 --> 00:25:57.006
and Chiron has to do with wounds and pain.

505
00:25:57.006 --> 00:25:58.468
<v Regina>So we cannot deny the pain</v>

506
00:25:58.468 --> 00:26:00.366
that we are in collectively and individually.

507
00:26:00.366 --> 00:26:01.785
<v ->Thank you, we can't deny our pain.</v>

508
00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:05.081
We have a chance to stop denying our pain.

509
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:06.265
<v Regina>It gives me chills when you're</v>

510
00:26:06.265 --> 00:26:07.502
talking about that.

511
00:26:07.502 --> 00:26:10.403
<v ->We have the chance, and we've been led up to it</v>

512
00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:14.552
through a relatively benefic addition of Jupiter,

513
00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:19.298
which was in the conjunction last year.

514
00:26:19.298 --> 00:26:20.877
A lot of people have written about this,

515
00:26:20.877 --> 00:26:23.682
so I won't talk about that in detail,

516
00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:27.767
but it's almost as if there was a...

517
00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:31.608
Jupiter lent to the party this ingredient

518
00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:35.992
of internationalizing the phenomenon

519
00:26:35.992 --> 00:26:40.992
that now Neptune and Chiron are left alone to finish up.

520
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.079
That means that Jupiter, which makes everything

521
00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:48.463
big and expansive and go beyond its boundaries,

522
00:26:48.463 --> 00:26:50.671
made it undeniable to the whole world

523
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:53.753
that we're all in this together.

524
00:26:53.753 --> 00:26:56.473
Then we look at the fact that these things

525
00:26:56.473 --> 00:27:00.356
were conjunct on the USA moon,

526
00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:05.356
and I think when you talk about the houses under water,

527
00:27:06.873 --> 00:27:11.873
it's such a cosmic pun, because Neptune governs flooding,

528
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.514
and things being literally underwater.

529
00:27:15.514 --> 00:27:18.724
Neptune also governs illusion,

530
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:23.620
and Chiron is pain, so we have a whole bunch of people

531
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.062
who were inundated with the illusion

532
00:27:26.062 --> 00:27:29.284
that they owned their homes and they never really did.

533
00:27:29.284 --> 00:27:30.329
<v Regina>Right.</v>

534
00:27:30.329 --> 00:27:33.369
<v ->Or the illusion that they had equity in their houses,</v>

535
00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:34.595
and they didn't.

536
00:27:34.595 --> 00:27:38.083
There's thiis wrenching pain, which is very close to home,

537
00:27:38.083 --> 00:27:41.080
home in another sense, the USA moon,

538
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.952
moon is the home in all senses of the word.

539
00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:48.600
<v Regina>And many, many more of these to come.</v>

540
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.151
<v ->Here's where you get this idea of the interchange</v>

541
00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:55.981
between Pluto, which is, remember, not so much,

542
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:58.466
Pluto and Capricorn didn't invent the corruption

543
00:27:58.466 --> 00:28:01.858
of the financial system, it just exposed it.

544
00:28:01.858 --> 00:28:05.900
It exposes decay to the light.

545
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.262
You get it squaring these

546
00:28:10.262 --> 00:28:15.262
Uranian realizations in the public mind.

547
00:28:15.512 --> 00:28:17.997
There's a real friction there.

548
00:28:17.997 --> 00:28:20.226
People who don't want to believe,

549
00:28:20.226 --> 00:28:23.938
and who go into the kind of Neptunian denial mechanisms,

550
00:28:23.938 --> 00:28:27.511
which there are so many of them, aren't there?

551
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:30.819
I think that the USA is ground zero for them.

552
00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:31.651
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

553
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:34.040
<v ->I think consumerism is really the biggest</v>

554
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.104
denial mechanism we have as a country.

555
00:28:38.104 --> 00:28:39.683
<v Regina>If it hurts, go shopping.</v>

556
00:28:39.683 --> 00:28:40.984
<v ->If it hurts, go shopping.</v>

557
00:28:40.984 --> 00:28:42.445
<v Regina>Consume.</v>

558
00:28:42.445 --> 00:28:45.081
<v ->Consumerism is an interesting thing.</v>

559
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:48.494
It's really behind peak oil.

560
00:28:48.494 --> 00:28:52.494
It's really behind the whole fossil fuels obsession,

561
00:28:52.494 --> 00:28:57.494
which pushes through to obsess about oil

562
00:28:58.083 --> 00:29:01.080
and still we've got the governor of California

563
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.218
thinking that he's going to drill off the coast.

564
00:29:05.218 --> 00:29:08.631
They really are still stuck on that idea

565
00:29:08.631 --> 00:29:11.854
that this non-renewable resource

566
00:29:11.854 --> 00:29:16.686
is worth laying waste to the environment over.

567
00:29:16.686 --> 00:29:20.774
That's a form of macro-cosmic consumerism.

568
00:29:20.774 --> 00:29:21.798
<v Regina>Right.</v>

569
00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:24.955
<v ->Then you have all these other symptoms of consumerism,</v>

570
00:29:24.955 --> 00:29:28.741
which are obesity, I guess, is the most

571
00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:30.745
obvious, literal form.

572
00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:32.986
<v Regina>Rising by the month, statistically.</v>

573
00:29:32.986 --> 00:29:35.740
<v ->It's very frightening.</v>

574
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.175
It's kind of another close to home version.

575
00:29:39.175 --> 00:29:41.361
<v Regina>This, often, if you're speaking</v>

576
00:29:41.361 --> 00:29:44.092
on an individual basis, has to do again

577
00:29:44.092 --> 00:29:48.092
with pain and filling a void, or satisfying,

578
00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:49.510
soothing a pain of some kind.

579
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.488
We're talking about it en masse.

580
00:29:52.488 --> 00:29:56.733
We can lay it off to clever marketing campaigns

581
00:29:56.733 --> 00:29:59.964
and strategies by the FDA and so forth,

582
00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:03.452
in terms of the food pyramids changing,

583
00:30:03.452 --> 00:30:04.999
and this, that, and the other thing.

584
00:30:04.999 --> 00:30:09.649
The reality is, it's only to assuage pain.

585
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:13.318
<v ->I think that this is the most important point of all.</v>

586
00:30:13.318 --> 00:30:14.986
I think this is the way that we're really

587
00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:17.752
going to understand how to deal with

588
00:30:17.752 --> 00:30:22.029
this Neptune, Chiron, and Aquarius thing,

589
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:25.719
which goes through 2011.

590
00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:29.409
You know, these transits that are around for so long

591
00:30:29.409 --> 00:30:32.353
are that long-lasting, because they have something

592
00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:35.169
so profound to teach.

593
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:38.721
They want us to really get it.

594
00:30:39.768 --> 00:30:43.693
Chiron is a tricky planet.

595
00:30:43.693 --> 00:30:44.898
It's not really a planet, you know,

596
00:30:44.898 --> 00:30:49.804
it has an eccentric orbit and was only discovered

597
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:53.399
by humans in 1977.

598
00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:57.857
A lot of astrologers don't even use it,

599
00:30:57.857 --> 00:31:02.635
but I think it's tricky to talk about in other ways.

600
00:31:02.635 --> 00:31:07.510
More importantly, that it speaks to a wound

601
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.859
that is hard to explain psychologically.

602
00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:15.157
Of course, it can be said to mean all kinds of wounds.

603
00:31:15.157 --> 00:31:18.218
We can project our inner pain on any number

604
00:31:18.218 --> 00:31:22.517
of stories that explain why we hurt.

605
00:31:22.517 --> 00:31:24.746
Those aren't lies.

606
00:31:24.746 --> 00:31:28.639
I'm not saying that they are when I say they're stories,

607
00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:33.639
but I want to suggest that the real aborigines

608
00:31:33.963 --> 00:31:37.952
of Chiron pain,

609
00:31:37.952 --> 00:31:42.581
date from when we incarnated and were expelled,

610
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:46.826
as it were, from the garden.

611
00:31:46.826 --> 00:31:49.567
In other words, you can't really get this level

612
00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:53.556
of meaning of Chiron unless you already believe

613
00:31:53.556 --> 00:31:58.556
that human beings have a spiritual self,

614
00:31:58.857 --> 00:32:00.735
that there is this spiritual dimension

615
00:32:00.735 --> 00:32:02.772
to every human being.

616
00:32:02.772 --> 00:32:04.798
<v Regina>Thus the indications for the awakening,</v>

617
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:06.420
or the remembrance.

618
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.118
<v ->Yes, that it's all based upon the fact</v>

619
00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:11.742
that we have this cellular memory

620
00:32:11.742 --> 00:32:14.590
that we were all once connected.

621
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.758
Of course, we still are, but what incarnation did

622
00:32:17.758 --> 00:32:20.381
is make us forget that we are.

623
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:24.626
Chiron is the wound of sort of being abandoned

624
00:32:24.626 --> 00:32:29.626
by the Great Mother, and the ache to go back there.

625
00:32:31.431 --> 00:32:34.706
I think that's too deep and primal,

626
00:32:34.706 --> 00:32:39.559
and aboriginal really for a lot of people to make sense of.

627
00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:42.972
<v Regina>But yet, all of our deeper feelings</v>

628
00:32:42.972 --> 00:32:47.590
and behaviors are essentially validating that very point.

629
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.913
<v ->That's what I think.</v>

630
00:32:48.913 --> 00:32:50.609
<v Regina>Everything we're doing to compensate,</v>

631
00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:52.251
it's all compensatory, for the most part.

632
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:53.393
<v ->That's what I believe.</v>

633
00:32:53.393 --> 00:32:55.441
That's what I think is the real meaning

634
00:32:55.441 --> 00:32:58.203
of Neptune conjunct Chiron in the sky.

635
00:32:58.203 --> 00:33:03.203
As you say, the consumerism is to try to fill this void,

636
00:33:04.517 --> 00:33:09.517
and gambling, what a sad thing that is.

637
00:33:10.417 --> 00:33:13.969
Indian reservations, I mean, it's such black humor,

638
00:33:13.969 --> 00:33:15.729
what we've done to the native peoples

639
00:33:15.729 --> 00:33:18.214
and how they've pulled a fast one on us,

640
00:33:18.214 --> 00:33:21.264
if you look at it in economic terms merely,

641
00:33:21.264 --> 00:33:25.584
by coming out ahead materially with these hideous --

642
00:33:25.584 --> 00:33:28.880
Oh well, it's a form of addiction,

643
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.685
and it's a form of the consumerism.

644
00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:34.287
I think the fact that they've just popped up now,

645
00:33:34.287 --> 00:33:39.287
like mushrooms after a rain in this Chiron period,

646
00:33:39.654 --> 00:33:43.461
Chiron has been in Aquarius for about five, six years.

647
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:46.331
Neptune has been in Aquarius for about 12.

648
00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:51.184
It's just now, 2009 to 2011, that they're all meeting up.

649
00:33:53.007 --> 00:33:57.276
These efforts to assuage our pain

650
00:33:57.276 --> 00:34:02.276
are not new, but they're becoming so blatant

651
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:04.891
that they cannot be denied, which goes back

652
00:34:04.891 --> 00:34:07.078
to your original point.

653
00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:11.717
It's all about denial, but now there's kind of a crossroads.

654
00:34:11.717 --> 00:34:15.365
Are you going to keep going, or trying to go,

655
00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:18.405
for the denial, because it'll get more and more difficult,

656
00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:20.847
or are you going to be one of the ones who

657
00:34:20.847 --> 00:34:25.071
really tries to brush denial off of yourself entirely

658
00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:30.071
and goes with this full excitement and sense of clarity

659
00:34:30.298 --> 00:34:34.105
into these years that your own soul incarnated

660
00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:36.495
into for a reason?

661
00:34:36.495 --> 00:34:39.748
<v Regina>Let me just asking something at this point,</v>

662
00:34:39.748 --> 00:34:41.305
because we're talking about the chart

663
00:34:41.305 --> 00:34:43.787
of the United States, right?

664
00:34:43.787 --> 00:34:44.586
<v ->Mostly.</v>

665
00:34:44.586 --> 00:34:45.942
<v Regina>Mostly, we're talking about the chart</v>

666
00:34:45.942 --> 00:34:46.955
of the United States.

667
00:34:46.955 --> 00:34:49.536
We're talking about a phenomena that seems very

668
00:34:49.536 --> 00:34:52.395
evident in the United States, in terms of every type

669
00:34:52.395 --> 00:34:57.035
of over-consumerism to fill some void and some pain,

670
00:34:57.035 --> 00:35:00.469
to soothe some pain.

671
00:35:00.469 --> 00:35:04.469
But because of the prominence of the United States,

672
00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:09.439
this has a definite passed on effect to the entire planet.

673
00:35:09.439 --> 00:35:10.666
<v ->Right.</v>

674
00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:15.615
As you know, you have that very idea spelled out in the sky,

675
00:35:15.615 --> 00:35:20.116
because Neptune governs universalization.

676
00:35:20.116 --> 00:35:21.236
It is not particular.

677
00:35:21.236 --> 00:35:24.894
It spills over boundaries, that's its job,

678
00:35:24.894 --> 00:35:28.681
so the idea of increased internationalization

679
00:35:28.681 --> 00:35:31.367
that we talked about

680
00:35:31.367 --> 00:35:36.007
as was last year's big theme,

681
00:35:36.007 --> 00:35:38.588
is now becoming even more so.

682
00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:42.182
The universal ills, they started here

683
00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:46.971
because we as a collective USA, also,

684
00:35:46.971 --> 00:35:51.824
incarnated as the world's only super power for a reason.

685
00:35:51.824 --> 00:35:53.765
If you don't believe anything is an accident,

686
00:35:53.765 --> 00:35:56.859
you have to believe that too.

687
00:35:56.859 --> 00:35:59.440
The fact that it has all these stunning,

688
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.544
the grand crosses above have all these stunning

689
00:36:02.544 --> 00:36:06.373
correlations with the USA chart, isn't --

690
00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:07.418
<v Regina>An accident.</v>

691
00:36:07.418 --> 00:36:09.786
<v ->An accident, none of it is random.</v>

692
00:36:09.786 --> 00:36:13.924
The fact that the computer revolution

693
00:36:13.924 --> 00:36:18.924
started just south of here in Silicon Valley,

694
00:36:20.196 --> 00:36:23.609
this is another piece that fits the transit so exactly,

695
00:36:23.609 --> 00:36:27.737
it makes astrologers laugh because we think,

696
00:36:27.737 --> 00:36:29.390
you can't make this stuff up.

697
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.779
<v Regina>And media, just a little further south,</v>

698
00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:34.008
in terms of whatever you want to call it, entertainment.

699
00:36:34.008 --> 00:36:35.288
<v ->Yes, exactly, that's right.</v>

700
00:36:35.288 --> 00:36:36.653
<v Regina>Edu-tainment and what not.</v>

701
00:36:36.653 --> 00:36:38.115
<v ->I do think that the internet,</v>

702
00:36:38.115 --> 00:36:40.067
which is governed by Aquarius,

703
00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:42.690
if any sign governs it, it's Aquarius,

704
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.570
and Neptune, which governs this universalization,

705
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:50.570
this covering the whole world, as you were suggesting,

706
00:36:52.492 --> 00:36:54.466
it was the last 12 years that made

707
00:36:54.466 --> 00:36:56.738
the internet what it is.

708
00:36:56.738 --> 00:36:58.476
Before then, it was --

709
00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.268
I mean, do you remember the well?

710
00:37:00.268 --> 00:37:02.476
It had these little primitive beginnings,

711
00:37:02.476 --> 00:37:03.606
the idea of the internet.

712
00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:04.822
<v Regina>Yes, that's right.</v>

713
00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.305
<v ->Which, most of our listeners are probably</v>

714
00:37:06.305 --> 00:37:07.606
scratching their heads.

715
00:37:07.606 --> 00:37:09.814
<v Regina>When the only video game at that time was Pong.</v>

716
00:37:09.814 --> 00:37:12.203
<v ->Pong, bing, bing, little yellow guy.</v>

717
00:37:12.203 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Regina>Bing, bing, bing.</v>

718
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.776
I mean, it is astounding what's happened technologically,

719
00:37:15.776 --> 00:37:17.990
in terms of entertainment and information.

720
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.352
<v ->It's happened so fast, and we can look at the fact</v>

721
00:37:20.352 --> 00:37:22.222
that the planets we're looking at,

722
00:37:22.222 --> 00:37:26.659
involved in these configurations, defy time.

723
00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:27.897
They're stronger than time.

724
00:37:27.897 --> 00:37:30.937
They don't operate within the confines of normal,

725
00:37:30.937 --> 00:37:35.513
one year to the next, calendar time.

726
00:37:35.513 --> 00:37:40.035
Neptune in Aquarius, 12 years it's been.

727
00:37:40.035 --> 00:37:43.566
It's revolutionized the way people interact.

728
00:37:43.566 --> 00:37:46.605
I think it's going to be centuries before

729
00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:49.720
sociologists have any kind of perspective

730
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.317
on the degree to which the internet has changed

731
00:37:54.317 --> 00:37:57.474
human social interaction.

732
00:37:57.474 --> 00:38:01.602
It's happened so fast that we can't even conceive of it.

733
00:38:01.602 --> 00:38:03.863
The fact that they're in Aquarius,

734
00:38:03.863 --> 00:38:07.713
Aquarius governs groups and collectives.

735
00:38:07.713 --> 00:38:10.401
Chiron, as we say, is wounds and pain,

736
00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:15.401
and I think that so much of the social networking

737
00:38:15.725 --> 00:38:18.808
is covering up a deep loneliness.

738
00:38:18.808 --> 00:38:21.069
<v Regina>That's what I was just going to ask next.</v>

739
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:24.567
It creates a type of connectivity that we have lost

740
00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:28.962
the feel for on kind of an indigenous level.

741
00:38:28.962 --> 00:38:32.887
<v ->Right, and it isn't true that Aquarius has to be that.</v>

742
00:38:32.887 --> 00:38:37.847
Aquarius governs a kind of a righteous,

743
00:38:37.847 --> 00:38:39.457
I mean that in the positive sense of the word,

744
00:38:39.457 --> 00:38:42.934
friendship, where in its classical meaning,

745
00:38:42.934 --> 00:38:46.582
Aquarius is the sign of a meeting of like minds,

746
00:38:46.582 --> 00:38:51.582
and an idealistic kind of intellectual coming together,

747
00:38:52.107 --> 00:38:57.107
whereby groups and an individual can meet up with a group

748
00:38:57.333 --> 00:39:02.333
in just the right way to share her skills

749
00:39:03.936 --> 00:39:06.517
by first becoming an individual herself.

750
00:39:06.517 --> 00:39:09.087
By the way, we can't skip that step.

751
00:39:09.087 --> 00:39:12.298
Righteous Aquarius implies that things

752
00:39:12.298 --> 00:39:14.154
are done in that order.

753
00:39:14.154 --> 00:39:16.148
We become a unique individual

754
00:39:16.148 --> 00:39:18.559
and we are clear on our personhood,

755
00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:20.980
and then we come together and convene

756
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.412
with large groups of people.

757
00:39:23.412 --> 00:39:25.225
<v Regina>So, the internet is the absolute perfect tool --</v>

758
00:39:25.225 --> 00:39:26.505
<v ->It has done wonderful things.</v>

759
00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:28.830
<v Regina>...to have arrived exactly on cue.</v>

760
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.678
<v ->We're totally not putting it down,</v>

761
00:39:31.678 --> 00:39:34.472
but when we look at Chiron's involvement,

762
00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:38.899
we're being forced to look at the loneliness

763
00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:41.299
and the isolation, ironically,

764
00:39:41.299 --> 00:39:45.426
which is the shadow of all of this.

765
00:39:45.426 --> 00:39:50.426
Every conjunction, dinky or huge and epochal,

766
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.459
has a shadow side,

767
00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:57.321
as well as this world-altering epochal side.

768
00:39:57.321 --> 00:40:00.520
We know which side of these things we want to be on,

769
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.424
but to get out of denial, we have to look in them both.

770
00:40:04.424 --> 00:40:08.744
<v Regina>So, again, we're putting salve on this</v>

771
00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:11.272
deep feeling of not being part of,

772
00:40:11.272 --> 00:40:14.437
of deep, deep inner kind of longing and loneliness,

773
00:40:14.437 --> 00:40:18.778
by the salve is the internet, for example.

774
00:40:18.778 --> 00:40:23.045
People texting and Twittering by the moment, practically.

775
00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:24.047
<v ->And friending.</v>

776
00:40:24.047 --> 00:40:25.050
<v Regina>And friending.</v>

777
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.767
<v ->We should have known, shouldn't we have,</v>

778
00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:29.273
when the word friend became a verb,

779
00:40:29.273 --> 00:40:31.225
that something was really weird.

780
00:40:31.225 --> 00:40:32.548
<v Regina>Yeah, friending.</v>

781
00:40:32.548 --> 00:40:37.348
So we're seeing the shadow and the possibilities.

782
00:40:37.348 --> 00:40:39.492
We're seeing the medicine for it, that people feel

783
00:40:39.492 --> 00:40:41.070
they can reach into right now,

784
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.321
but there's a larger medicine.

785
00:40:43.321 --> 00:40:46.499
What about reclaiming our genuine sense of connection

786
00:40:46.499 --> 00:40:48.451
with each other, self, and beyond?

787
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:49.870
<v ->Right.</v>

788
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.266
That is the golden core

789
00:40:54.266 --> 00:40:58.116
of Neptune and Chiron in Aquarius.

790
00:40:58.116 --> 00:41:02.873
For those who do ritual, the middle of next month

791
00:41:02.873 --> 00:41:04.569
would be a wonderful time.

792
00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:05.913
<v Regina>We're talking the middle of February.</v>

793
00:41:05.913 --> 00:41:08.590
<v ->The 16th and 17th of February, 2010,</v>

794
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.073
is one of these times.

795
00:41:10.073 --> 00:41:12.441
It's not confined to those times,

796
00:41:12.441 --> 00:41:15.257
and as I say, it'll go through 2011.

797
00:41:15.257 --> 00:41:18.616
Even after that, these two will be neck and neck

798
00:41:18.616 --> 00:41:23.075
for a while, but for people who do ritual,

799
00:41:23.075 --> 00:41:26.721
in this spirit that you're talking about,

800
00:41:26.721 --> 00:41:31.721
to zone in on the very highest potential,

801
00:41:33.549 --> 00:41:36.887
rather than the lowest and sort of unconscious

802
00:41:36.887 --> 00:41:41.887
symptomologies that we're seeing that we talked about.

803
00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.827
Neptune is the spiritualization

804
00:41:46.827 --> 00:41:51.827
of whatever it touches, and Chiron is pain,

805
00:41:53.429 --> 00:41:57.631
and Aquarius is the group, the collective.

806
00:41:57.631 --> 00:42:01.151
<v Regina>We are to, I guess,</v>

807
00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:03.850
go to the deeper well within ourselves

808
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.932
to, en masse, transcend this pain?

809
00:42:06.932 --> 00:42:09.097
<v ->Yes, to transcend our individual pain</v>

810
00:42:09.097 --> 00:42:14.097
by understanding the aboriginal nature of group pain.

811
00:42:14.379 --> 00:42:18.208
That, it's interesting, the chart for that exact conjunction

812
00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:22.133
shows a moon in Aries and a bunch of other features

813
00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:27.133
which suggests that to half understand it

814
00:42:27.402 --> 00:42:32.393
implies a certain degree of delusional selfishness.

815
00:42:32.393 --> 00:42:36.128
That is one side of this thing, another thing not to do,

816
00:42:36.128 --> 00:42:39.050
but to get out of denial, we have to look at

817
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.002
the temptations around us,

818
00:42:41.002 --> 00:42:44.693
and how many people are giving in to that.

819
00:42:44.693 --> 00:42:47.829
It reminds me of the kind of thinking that

820
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:52.829
people who are arguing against healthcare reform

821
00:42:54.059 --> 00:42:56.917
were into when they really weren't thinking.

822
00:42:56.917 --> 00:42:59.915
Because they had insurance, they really weren't thinking

823
00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:02.858
about the millions who didn't.

824
00:43:02.858 --> 00:43:06.367
It was clear that they didn't give a fig about them.

825
00:43:06.367 --> 00:43:08.127
It's delusional.

826
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:11.679
It's in denial about the state of the collective,

827
00:43:11.679 --> 00:43:15.956
and it's also this kind of icky selfishness.

828
00:43:15.956 --> 00:43:20.084
Now, if we're going to get to the golden core,

829
00:43:20.084 --> 00:43:24.084
we have to go back to what Neptune promises,

830
00:43:24.084 --> 00:43:29.084
which is that we really are all interconnected.

831
00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:33.279
It's not just a new age cliche,

832
00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:37.599
it's the truth behind all other truths.

833
00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:42.599
To live from there, I mean to actually live your life

834
00:43:42.846 --> 00:43:47.390
as if that was so, is to see all these other connections

835
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:52.390
for what they are, which are illusions.

836
00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:55.635
It's okay to have illusion in your life

837
00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:59.933
if you understand the real illusions,

838
00:43:59.933 --> 00:44:02.515
to name them as such.

839
00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:07.515
Such as the fact that countries have boundaries.

840
00:44:10.077 --> 00:44:12.839
If everything is flooded with global warming,

841
00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:15.260
I'm not saying that I'm seeing this happening,

842
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.185
but clearly, water levels are rising.

843
00:44:19.185 --> 00:44:24.185
We're given, if nothing else, the hint of this,

844
00:44:25.244 --> 00:44:27.004
so that we can think about it

845
00:44:27.004 --> 00:44:29.329
and consider the implications.

846
00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:33.318
You know the, in Copenhagen, in December,

847
00:44:33.318 --> 00:44:36.710
how there was this wonderful bit of guerilla theatre

848
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.398
by the President of Maldives,

849
00:44:39.398 --> 00:44:44.398
when he held his cabinet meeting under water.

850
00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:49.221
Because what, his whole island is seven miles

851
00:44:49.221 --> 00:44:51.866
above sea level only, so his will be

852
00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:53.530
the first to be flooded.

853
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.388
This was the canary in the mind.

854
00:44:56.388 --> 00:44:59.268
I think that the whole cosmos is giving us

855
00:44:59.268 --> 00:45:03.215
a little bit of guerilla theatre here, like he did,

856
00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:07.050
to say that you who take your

857
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.399
nationalisms so seriously,

858
00:45:10.399 --> 00:45:13.930
the patriots of all the countries who consider

859
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.979
that your own countries are so inviolate

860
00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:20.277
that you should and can build walls.

861
00:45:20.277 --> 00:45:23.104
Israel is building a new wall now on their Egyptian border

862
00:45:23.104 --> 00:45:25.015
to keep out the African migrants.

863
00:45:25.015 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Regina>Yes, I've read about it.</v>

864
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.689
<v ->After boycotting, and I can't even talk about</v>

865
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:34.326
what they're doing to Palestine, it's so painful.

866
00:45:34.326 --> 00:45:36.299
We're doing the same thing, the USA,

867
00:45:36.299 --> 00:45:38.486
on our southern border with Mexico.

868
00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:42.080
When you look at it through Neptune's eyes,

869
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.035
if we can anthropomorphize and imagine

870
00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:47.616
what the great god who says, "There are no such things

871
00:45:47.616 --> 00:45:50.282
"as separations, it's all illusion."

872
00:45:50.282 --> 00:45:54.367
What must he think of this folly?

873
00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:59.007
Then you can see how these telluric activities,

874
00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:03.999
like global warming and this terrible earthquake in Haiti,

875
00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:06.529
which happened right on the eclipse,

876
00:46:06.529 --> 00:46:07.926
two days before the eclipse,

877
00:46:07.926 --> 00:46:10.646
where everything is crumbled down.

878
00:46:10.646 --> 00:46:15.104
Pluto destruction, Capricorn structures.

879
00:46:15.104 --> 00:46:16.235
It's all written --

880
00:46:16.235 --> 00:46:18.443
<v Regina>But does this not bring up an opportunity</v>

881
00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:20.554
to have a global response?

882
00:46:20.554 --> 00:46:22.805
To have a global heart of sorts?

883
00:46:22.805 --> 00:46:25.781
<v ->Well, the point I'm trying to make now</v>

884
00:46:25.781 --> 00:46:30.781
is that these are symptoms of energetic themes,

885
00:46:31.775 --> 00:46:34.879
that if we saw these, not to disconnect

886
00:46:34.879 --> 00:46:36.735
from the human level.

887
00:46:36.735 --> 00:46:41.735
If we take Neptune's wisdom to heart,

888
00:46:41.822 --> 00:46:45.630
we'll see that it might as well have been us.

889
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:48.137
Neptune is that kind of compassion

890
00:46:48.137 --> 00:46:51.176
that sees no distinction between human groups.

891
00:46:51.176 --> 00:46:52.712
If something terrible happens to them,

892
00:46:52.712 --> 00:46:54.686
it is to happen to us.

893
00:46:54.686 --> 00:46:58.291
But the global warming I'm trying to speak to,

894
00:46:58.291 --> 00:46:59.752
actually, I'm trying to tell people

895
00:46:59.752 --> 00:47:03.581
not to be afraid of it, because if they consider it

896
00:47:03.581 --> 00:47:08.581
as a symbol, they'll realize why the cosmos made it up,

897
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:14.010
to make us realize that the parameters

898
00:47:14.055 --> 00:47:18.215
that we put on our countries are arbitrary.

899
00:47:18.215 --> 00:47:19.794
They're silly.

900
00:47:19.794 --> 00:47:23.900
It's to get trans-national immediately in our thinking.

901
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.596
<v Regina>Yet, at the same time,</v>

902
00:47:25.596 --> 00:47:27.271
some of the people listening to this right now

903
00:47:27.271 --> 00:47:30.470
from around the world would say,

904
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:33.030
"Oh goodness, and that brings us right up against

905
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.579
"new world order, globalization," and all these

906
00:47:35.579 --> 00:47:39.227
other concepts that are also,

907
00:47:39.227 --> 00:47:41.414
that humanity is being presented with

908
00:47:41.414 --> 00:47:45.008
because of some of the dysfunction of other parts of,

909
00:47:45.008 --> 00:47:49.317
not just the U.S.'s chart, but other factors.

910
00:47:49.317 --> 00:47:53.008
It's not by accident, I suppose, that greed and corruption,

911
00:47:53.008 --> 00:47:55.951
they've always existed, but that they have come to reign

912
00:47:55.951 --> 00:47:59.855
so extensively around the planet now.

913
00:47:59.855 --> 00:48:02.916
You come into this human understanding

914
00:48:02.916 --> 00:48:07.916
that we do need to be a global human species.

915
00:48:08.217 --> 00:48:10.607
We do need to look beyond borders.

916
00:48:10.607 --> 00:48:12.601
Then you come up against, "But I don't want

917
00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:16.313
"the people that are trying to control the global show

918
00:48:16.313 --> 00:48:18.126
"to be in control of me."

919
00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:20.707
What happens in there when you're looking at --

920
00:48:20.707 --> 00:48:23.864
<v ->Yeah, that's a very good question.</v>

921
00:48:23.864 --> 00:48:27.320
It depends on a lot of faith.

922
00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.083
Before I answer it, may we take a break?

923
00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:30.790
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

924
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.625
We've taken our little tea break and warmed up a bit.

925
00:48:32.625 --> 00:48:33.926
It was chilly in here.

926
00:48:33.926 --> 00:48:36.593
Now, let's get back to the question that I posed

927
00:48:36.593 --> 00:48:39.312
just before we broke, which is,

928
00:48:39.312 --> 00:48:44.123
universality of spirit versus new world order,

929
00:48:44.123 --> 00:48:45.861
heavily contrived, heavily controlled

930
00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:47.504
by the same groups of people that have been

931
00:48:47.504 --> 00:48:49.765
perpetrating this and foisting it on the planet

932
00:48:49.765 --> 00:48:53.229
for a very long time now.

933
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:57.992
<v ->There's so many levels to talking about</v>

934
00:48:57.992 --> 00:48:59.613
something like this.

935
00:48:59.613 --> 00:49:02.653
One is very esoteric,

936
00:49:02.653 --> 00:49:05.789
and one is sort of on the ground, like,

937
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:07.389
"But what about these governments?

938
00:49:07.389 --> 00:49:09.757
"What about what the CIA is up to?"

939
00:49:09.757 --> 00:49:11.964
What about this and that?

940
00:49:11.964 --> 00:49:15.260
In literal, which is absolutely real,

941
00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.745
and then one is kind of intermediate,

942
00:49:17.745 --> 00:49:21.319
which says, "Well, that's a symbol of this and that."

943
00:49:21.319 --> 00:49:24.177
It all gets kind of difficult to express.

944
00:49:24.177 --> 00:49:28.731
I'm going to start with the most esoteric of all,

945
00:49:28.731 --> 00:49:31.639
which is, I believe we create our own reality,

946
00:49:31.639 --> 00:49:35.328
and I don't believe it in a conditional way.

947
00:49:35.328 --> 00:49:38.559
I believe that it's unconditionally true.

948
00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:43.221
I believe that we, as individuals, create our own reality,

949
00:49:43.221 --> 00:49:45.706
as even the psychologists will agree

950
00:49:45.706 --> 00:49:48.628
in terms of self-fulfilling prophecy and so on.

951
00:49:48.628 --> 00:49:51.167
They've noticed this is true on that level.

952
00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:54.857
I agree that collectives, I believe that collectives

953
00:49:54.857 --> 00:49:57.641
create our own reality.

954
00:49:57.641 --> 00:49:59.454
I look at the chart of the USA

955
00:49:59.454 --> 00:50:04.454
and I see that in 2022 when Pluto returns,

956
00:50:06.215 --> 00:50:09.234
we could either go bust in every sense of the word,

957
00:50:09.234 --> 00:50:11.441
or we could completely remake ourselves over

958
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:14.919
and hold on to the thread of identity

959
00:50:14.919 --> 00:50:19.919
that is the very best of the USA as it was once conceived.

960
00:50:20.006 --> 00:50:23.397
It's not written yet. It's a potential.

961
00:50:23.397 --> 00:50:25.050
<v Regina>There's a choice point.</v>

962
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.088
Yes, a choice point, we're at a choice point.

963
00:50:27.088 --> 00:50:29.338
<v ->Choice point is a good phrase.</v>

964
00:50:29.338 --> 00:50:32.058
I would say that, and this is the same thing

965
00:50:32.058 --> 00:50:35.258
people ask me when they consider

966
00:50:35.258 --> 00:50:37.583
these dire transits going on.

967
00:50:37.583 --> 00:50:39.631
Yeah, they're dire, but if we take

968
00:50:39.631 --> 00:50:43.801
all value judgement away, all you get is intensity.

969
00:50:43.801 --> 00:50:44.943
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

970
00:50:44.943 --> 00:50:47.780
<v ->If people could conceive of looking at things</v>

971
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.468
without the good-bad dualism,

972
00:50:50.468 --> 00:50:52.185
which is very difficult for people.

973
00:50:52.185 --> 00:50:54.979
We're completely brainwashed into thinking,

974
00:50:54.979 --> 00:50:58.525
"Well, it has to be good or it has to be bad.

975
00:50:58.525 --> 00:51:00.338
"There isn't any other way."

976
00:51:00.338 --> 00:51:02.237
What if it was just intense?

977
00:51:02.237 --> 00:51:04.562
What if it was just energy?

978
00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:06.535
What if it was the kind of energy that we see

979
00:51:06.535 --> 00:51:09.788
up in the sky right now that would squeeze

980
00:51:09.788 --> 00:51:11.858
a new result (makes popping noise)

981
00:51:11.858 --> 00:51:16.858
out of an old set of circumstances?

982
00:51:17.468 --> 00:51:21.958
That's the way I see the cardinal cross happening.

983
00:51:21.958 --> 00:51:25.180
Now, when you talk about the types of dark

984
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:30.180
or shadow versions of these controlling elements,

985
00:51:30.545 --> 00:51:34.118
astrologers mostly look at the Saturn-Pluto piece

986
00:51:34.118 --> 00:51:38.832
of the cardinal cross as being that.

987
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.997
It's reaction.

988
00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:43.013
Throughout history, there have been

989
00:51:43.013 --> 00:51:48.013
some very ugly authoritative agencies

990
00:51:48.122 --> 00:51:52.185
which have contrived to dominate,

991
00:51:52.185 --> 00:51:56.526
in terms of financial, physical, life and death

992
00:51:56.526 --> 00:51:58.894
power over other people.

993
00:51:58.894 --> 00:52:02.222
It is associated with oppression on that level,

994
00:52:02.222 --> 00:52:04.611
with governmental fascism.

995
00:52:04.611 --> 00:52:08.259
Of course, that is in there.

996
00:52:08.259 --> 00:52:13.259
It's one of the dark multitudes of potential

997
00:52:13.336 --> 00:52:14.776
in the patterns we're seeing.

998
00:52:14.776 --> 00:52:17.400
They're so intense, how could it not be in there?

999
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.589
We're talking about life and death transits.

1000
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:21.698
<v Regina>The issue seems to be with</v>

1001
00:52:21.698 --> 00:52:23.607
the disempowered people.

1002
00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:26.573
<v ->Yes, the issue is with empowerment or not.</v>

1003
00:52:26.573 --> 00:52:27.479
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1004
00:52:27.479 --> 00:52:30.124
<v ->If you take on the most individual level,</v>

1005
00:52:30.124 --> 00:52:34.305
and transpersonal psychology has made

1006
00:52:34.305 --> 00:52:37.559
a very good case for this,

1007
00:52:37.559 --> 00:52:39.692
that if every person were empowered

1008
00:52:39.692 --> 00:52:42.294
in terms of what she or he could do,

1009
00:52:42.294 --> 00:52:44.566
which astrologically translates to,

1010
00:52:44.566 --> 00:52:46.379
"If they would only live through their charts,

1011
00:52:46.379 --> 00:52:48.118
"and stop barking up the wrong tree

1012
00:52:48.118 --> 00:52:52.906
"of somebody else's externally

1013
00:52:52.906 --> 00:52:55.892
"derived sense of standards,"

1014
00:52:55.892 --> 00:52:58.803
then we would be more powerful

1015
00:52:58.803 --> 00:53:01.875
than we could ever imagine.

1016
00:53:01.875 --> 00:53:03.987
If everyone did that.

1017
00:53:03.987 --> 00:53:05.373
This goes back to, I think, the thing

1018
00:53:05.373 --> 00:53:07.006
we were saying at the very beginning,

1019
00:53:07.006 --> 00:53:11.603
which is the dividing the sheep from the goats time.

1020
00:53:11.603 --> 00:53:14.365
<v Regina>That makes for a powerful choice point,</v>

1021
00:53:14.365 --> 00:53:16.872
not one that is reactionary in nature.

1022
00:53:16.872 --> 00:53:19.709
<v ->Well, if we react, we're dead meat now.</v>

1023
00:53:19.709 --> 00:53:22.535
<v Regina>We are reacting, in fear for the most part.</v>

1024
00:53:22.535 --> 00:53:23.996
<v ->Well, there are huge numbers of people</v>

1025
00:53:23.996 --> 00:53:25.586
who are reacting through fear.

1026
00:53:25.586 --> 00:53:27.303
<v Regina>Yeah, the majority seem to be.</v>

1027
00:53:27.303 --> 00:53:29.063
<v ->The difference between using,</v>

1028
00:53:29.063 --> 00:53:33.244
Saturn is the ingredient of the mix that

1029
00:53:33.244 --> 00:53:35.025
tells us about that piece.

1030
00:53:35.025 --> 00:53:39.537
Saturn is either reaction or response,

1031
00:53:39.537 --> 00:53:41.947
which is the root of responsibility.

1032
00:53:41.947 --> 00:53:45.883
<v Regina>And response is from an empowered individual.</v>

1033
00:53:45.883 --> 00:53:48.901
<v ->You can only respond when you're right in the moment,</v>

1034
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:52.613
so then we get back to the idea of being in the now.

1035
00:53:52.613 --> 00:53:57.189
But to react is to be squeezed up and entrenched,

1036
00:53:57.189 --> 00:54:00.858
which is the way we were describing the forces earlier

1037
00:54:00.858 --> 00:54:04.729
when we were looking at the Saturn-Uranus opposition.

1038
00:54:04.729 --> 00:54:07.033
We were saying, it's the forces of reform

1039
00:54:07.033 --> 00:54:09.230
and wanting to change, versus these

1040
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.958
entrenched old agencies.

1041
00:54:10.958 --> 00:54:14.275
But that's only dark Saturn.

1042
00:54:14.275 --> 00:54:19.275
Light Saturn, or the more spiritually mature way

1043
00:54:19.779 --> 00:54:24.003
of using that piece of the sky we're under,

1044
00:54:24.003 --> 00:54:28.440
is maturity, which is a way to respond

1045
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.328
to whatever's happening.

1046
00:54:30.328 --> 00:54:34.012
Only grown-ups can do that.

1047
00:54:34.156 --> 00:54:36.428
<v Regina>Yes, that would be correct,</v>

1048
00:54:36.428 --> 00:54:39.009
and we don't have a history --

1049
00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.449
<v ->I mean spiritual grown-ups.</v>

1050
00:54:40.449 --> 00:54:41.612
<v Regina>Yes, spiritual grown-ups.</v>

1051
00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:43.286
We don't have a history of that as a culture just yet.

1052
00:54:43.286 --> 00:54:46.998
<v ->No, but now we're under such intense pressures</v>

1053
00:54:46.998 --> 00:54:50.646
that there isn't any choice to fence-straddle.

1054
00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:53.526
I think we're saying the same thing in different ways.

1055
00:54:53.526 --> 00:54:56.352
My way of understanding why, for example,

1056
00:54:56.352 --> 00:55:01.352
global warming came along, was,

1057
00:55:01.973 --> 00:55:04.554
I know this sounds like a sacrilege to say,

1058
00:55:04.554 --> 00:55:08.938
but it's the biggest blessing humanity ever had

1059
00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:13.140
because it's forcing what we were twiddling

1060
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.231
our thumbs over before, in terms of

1061
00:55:15.231 --> 00:55:16.809
the kinds of awarenesses.

1062
00:55:16.809 --> 00:55:20.457
Now we have to see we're all in this together.

1063
00:55:20.457 --> 00:55:25.160
Like this little guy, I mean this little island,

1064
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.925
the Maldives president who held his summit meeting

1065
00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:31.965
underwater was trying to explain,

1066
00:55:31.965 --> 00:55:33.565
that we're all in this together.

1067
00:55:33.565 --> 00:55:37.842
It's my island first, but it could be yours next,

1068
00:55:37.842 --> 00:55:39.933
and it will be.

1069
00:55:39.933 --> 00:55:44.082
To imagine the whole world as a unified whole

1070
00:55:44.082 --> 00:55:47.175
is exactly what Neptune is about.

1071
00:55:47.175 --> 00:55:51.303
It just takes a half an inch more step

1072
00:55:51.303 --> 00:55:54.417
to understand that it isn't even just countries

1073
00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.785
that are all in this together,

1074
00:55:56.785 --> 00:56:01.009
it's every sentient being in the cosmos.

1075
00:56:01.009 --> 00:56:05.798
It's every being, even inanimate being

1076
00:56:05.798 --> 00:56:09.061
in the cosmos, that we're all in this together.

1077
00:56:09.061 --> 00:56:10.992
That's ultimately the meaning of Neptune.

1078
00:56:10.992 --> 00:56:12.645
<v Regina>That is undeniable.</v>

1079
00:56:12.645 --> 00:56:17.637
The light and dark of how it plays out is our choice.

1080
00:56:17.637 --> 00:56:20.602
<v ->It's our choice, and it's our choice at every moment.</v>

1081
00:56:20.602 --> 00:56:25.602
When you consider, again this is a question of faith,

1082
00:56:26.084 --> 00:56:29.017
I can't really spell it out in rational terms

1083
00:56:29.017 --> 00:56:30.713
and have it make sense to everyone,

1084
00:56:30.713 --> 00:56:33.145
nor would I want to proselytize this.

1085
00:56:33.145 --> 00:56:37.811
I can only say that my understanding

1086
00:56:42.797 --> 00:56:47.570
of these metaphysical laws

1087
00:56:48.525 --> 00:56:53.356
are that light is everything,

1088
00:56:53.356 --> 00:56:57.196
and shadow is only the absence of light.

1089
00:56:57.196 --> 00:57:01.004
In a way, I don't really believe in light and dark

1090
00:57:01.004 --> 00:57:06.004
as being two equal polarities.

1091
00:57:06.175 --> 00:57:10.985
I think of, for example, a misused planet

1092
00:57:10.985 --> 00:57:12.351
as being just that.

1093
00:57:12.351 --> 00:57:14.462
It's because the person hasn't gotten hip

1094
00:57:14.462 --> 00:57:16.232
to the real meaning of the planet.

1095
00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:17.044
<v Regina>Yes, very true.</v>

1096
00:57:17.044 --> 00:57:18.814
It's more a function of ignorance.

1097
00:57:18.814 --> 00:57:19.945
<v ->It's ignorance.</v>

1098
00:57:19.945 --> 00:57:21.150
<v Regina>And lack of maturity.</v>

1099
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:22.985
<v ->Which there's nothing wrong with ignorance</v>

1100
00:57:22.985 --> 00:57:24.082
that can't be corrected.

1101
00:57:24.082 --> 00:57:24.872
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1102
00:57:24.872 --> 00:57:27.069
<v ->Then we get to information,</v>

1103
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:29.693
which is another thing I would like to put in here

1104
00:57:29.693 --> 00:57:32.274
if I were going to give a recommendation about

1105
00:57:32.274 --> 00:57:37.019
how people could line themselves up to be,

1106
00:57:37.019 --> 00:57:39.994
when we all find ourselves at the threshold,

1107
00:57:39.994 --> 00:57:42.640
to be on the path that goes towards the light

1108
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.794
instead of keeping in denial,

1109
00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:47.930
is to get clean information.

1110
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:49.231
<v Regina>Hard to find.</v>

1111
00:57:49.231 --> 00:57:51.652
<v ->This is why we need CMN,</v>

1112
00:57:51.652 --> 00:57:56.652
and their are other blogs that have some kind of rigor

1113
00:57:57.263 --> 00:58:00.473
and that are using the same kind of clean intelligence

1114
00:58:00.473 --> 00:58:03.097
that the best of the old media had.

1115
00:58:03.097 --> 00:58:06.318
We're very all too aware of the blogs that aren't,

1116
00:58:06.318 --> 00:58:08.386
but there are more and more blogs that are.

1117
00:58:08.386 --> 00:58:09.272
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1118
00:58:09.272 --> 00:58:12.663
<v ->And the underground press,</v>

1119
00:58:12.663 --> 00:58:17.356
and guerilla theatre,

1120
00:58:17.356 --> 00:58:19.116
and demonstrations in the street.

1121
00:58:19.116 --> 00:58:20.855
I think we should be seeing more of this.

1122
00:58:20.855 --> 00:58:24.268
It's a very direct way to get the word out.

1123
00:58:24.268 --> 00:58:28.076
There was last month's Berkeley demonstrations

1124
00:58:28.076 --> 00:58:29.686
at UC Berkeley.

1125
00:58:29.686 --> 00:58:33.750
There's nothing like young people shouting through

1126
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:38.112
a bullhorn and getting people to think about

1127
00:58:38.112 --> 00:58:42.549
the fact that there are all these students

1128
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:44.011
that can't get into classes,

1129
00:58:44.011 --> 00:58:46.421
meanwhile President Yudof is getting, what,

1130
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:48.768
a million dollars in a compensation package?

1131
00:58:48.768 --> 00:58:49.973
<v Regina>I know, criminal.</v>

1132
00:58:49.973 --> 00:58:52.480
<v ->This is very, very effective</v>

1133
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.221
as a way to get clean information out.

1134
00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:58.612
Street demonstrations, it's gone out of favor a little bit,

1135
00:58:58.612 --> 00:59:00.330
but I think it'll come back.

1136
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.492
This is Uranus.

1137
00:59:01.492 --> 00:59:04.212
This is the part of the grand cross that is Uranus,

1138
00:59:04.212 --> 00:59:06.527
the people rising up.

1139
00:59:08.137 --> 00:59:10.814
This is a long-winded way of answering your question,

1140
00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:15.814
which is that when individuals are out of denial,

1141
00:59:18.174 --> 00:59:20.584
which isn't, I want to say here,

1142
00:59:20.584 --> 00:59:24.467
the jury's still not out yet about this denial piece,

1143
00:59:24.467 --> 00:59:27.251
because all of this year we're going to have

1144
00:59:27.251 --> 00:59:32.251
Neptune and Chiron asking us,

1145
00:59:32.456 --> 00:59:34.237
"Are you going to get out of denial?

1146
00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.071
"Are you going to get out of denial?"

1147
00:59:36.071 --> 00:59:38.909
Again and again with all these different ways.

1148
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:40.903
Neptune is lies.

1149
00:59:40.903 --> 00:59:42.759
Chiron is pain.

1150
00:59:42.759 --> 00:59:45.148
Self-delusion is the drug.

1151
00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:50.148
This is going to be hugely up all of this year, 2010, 2011.

1152
00:59:50.513 --> 00:59:55.132
To those people who step up to the plate

1153
00:59:55.132 --> 00:59:59.355
and make some kind of a more dramatic

1154
00:59:59.355 --> 01:00:02.310
statement about their own self-actualization

1155
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.048
than they've ever made before,

1156
01:00:04.048 --> 01:00:05.424
because they never have had to before.

1157
01:00:05.424 --> 01:00:10.424
These transits are, literally, unprecedented.

1158
01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:14.170
Then they're going to have to live through their charts

1159
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.239
in a new way, because that's all they've got,

1160
01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:17.893
and that's all they need.

1161
01:00:17.893 --> 01:00:19.044
<v Regina>You mean authentic living?</v>

1162
01:00:19.044 --> 01:00:20.602
<v ->Authentically.</v>

1163
01:00:20.602 --> 01:00:25.529
When they do, it's stronger than shadow.

1164
01:00:25.529 --> 01:00:26.639
It just is.

1165
01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:28.079
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

1166
01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:31.940
<v ->If your remember back to the days when</v>

1167
01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:37.465
the New York Times was witnessing

1168
01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:41.646
all of these demonstrations before

1169
01:00:41.646 --> 01:00:44.888
the Pentagon bombed Iraq in shock and awe.

1170
01:00:44.888 --> 01:00:47.608
They were all over the world, every major big city,

1171
01:00:47.608 --> 01:00:49.261
millions of people were coming out.

1172
01:00:49.261 --> 01:00:50.065
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1173
01:00:50.065 --> 01:00:53.595
<v ->The New York Times had the prescience to say,</v>

1174
01:00:53.595 --> 01:00:57.168
"There are now two super powers in the world.

1175
01:00:57.168 --> 01:01:02.143
"The U.S. government and world public opinion."

1176
01:01:03.312 --> 01:01:07.002
World public opinion has it all over the U.S. government.

1177
01:01:07.002 --> 01:01:08.890
<v Regina>Yes. (laughs)</v>

1178
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:10.490
<v ->If you think of the numbers,</v>

1179
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:11.791
you can do it that way and you'd still

1180
01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:14.831
come to the same conclusion.

1181
01:01:14.831 --> 01:01:18.340
But if you came to the idea that I really meant

1182
01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:22.777
when I was introducing this esoterically,

1183
01:01:22.777 --> 01:01:25.998
the power of light has it all over the power of dark.

1184
01:01:25.998 --> 01:01:28.137
Dark doesn't even have any power.

1185
01:01:28.137 --> 01:01:29.341
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1186
01:01:29.341 --> 01:01:31.570
<v ->That's Uranus and I think it's going to win,</v>

1187
01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:36.423
and I think Jupiter is going to expand the explosion.

1188
01:01:36.423 --> 01:01:39.655
I think it's going to be like a spark to dry straw

1189
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:41.394
this summer.

1190
01:01:41.394 --> 01:01:44.626
I think if you want to look to a particular point

1191
01:01:44.626 --> 01:01:49.308
to do rituals at, to breath this vision into being,

1192
01:01:49.308 --> 01:01:53.073
it would be the lunar eclipse on June 26th,

1193
01:01:53.073 --> 01:01:56.465
where we're going to have seven planets no less

1194
01:01:56.465 --> 01:01:58.598
involved in this grand cross.

1195
01:01:58.598 --> 01:02:00.507
<v Regina>Wow, that's powerful.</v>

1196
01:02:00.507 --> 01:02:04.475
<v ->I think that a good practice for people</v>

1197
01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:08.581
can be to take the four pieces of the cross apart

1198
01:02:08.581 --> 01:02:12.901
and make a commitment

1199
01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:17.264
to live through its highest expression,

1200
01:02:17.264 --> 01:02:19.781
each one in order.

1201
01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:22.760
First of all, there's Saturn, whose highest expression

1202
01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.240
is not fear, that's its shadow expression.

1203
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.405
It's maturity.

1204
01:02:29.405 --> 01:02:32.744
To take responsibility for being alive right now,

1205
01:02:32.744 --> 01:02:35.666
right here in this moment,

1206
01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:39.250
with the skills I have, nobody else's.

1207
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:41.938
It's absolutely enough.

1208
01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:46.938
And Uranus, which is the strength of inventive ideas,

1209
01:02:47.742 --> 01:02:49.459
which is going to be joined by Jupiter,

1210
01:02:49.459 --> 01:02:53.896
so it's a wise and knowledgeable use of invention

1211
01:02:53.896 --> 01:02:58.237
rather than some wacky --

1212
01:02:58.237 --> 01:03:00.487
<v Regina>It won't be a pet rock. (laughs)</v>

1213
01:03:00.487 --> 01:03:02.162
<v ->Won't be a pet rock.</v>

1214
01:03:02.162 --> 01:03:05.085
There may be a few very odd fads.

1215
01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:07.740
Look at the internet, it's full of them,

1216
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.679
but we're talking about making choices here.

1217
01:03:12.679 --> 01:03:17.308
Then there's Pluto, in the planet of,

1218
01:03:17.308 --> 01:03:22.235
in the sign rather, of physical structures,

1219
01:03:22.235 --> 01:03:24.902
decaying, breaking down.

1220
01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:27.184
Physical structures of the earth too, you know,

1221
01:03:27.184 --> 01:03:29.691
which means tectonic plates.

1222
01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:31.014
<v Regina>Yes, we didn't get into that,</v>

1223
01:03:31.014 --> 01:03:33.008
and I know that is a portion of it.

1224
01:03:33.008 --> 01:03:36.581
<v ->But also physical structures meaning material structures,</v>

1225
01:03:36.581 --> 01:03:40.154
which are symbolized by financial structures.

1226
01:03:40.154 --> 01:03:40.976
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1227
01:03:40.976 --> 01:03:42.853
<v ->That they're breaking down and their decay</v>

1228
01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:45.967
is becoming too obvious to ignore,

1229
01:03:45.967 --> 01:03:48.071
and making sure you're on the right side of that.

1230
01:03:48.071 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Regina>Well, there was a couple emails</v>

1231
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.025
that came in this morning to CMN.

1232
01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:53.627
Bank failures would be one extension of that,

1233
01:03:53.627 --> 01:03:56.134
as just one small example of the decay.

1234
01:03:56.134 --> 01:03:57.937
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

1235
01:03:57.937 --> 01:04:00.221
It's the example that's caught

1236
01:04:00.221 --> 01:04:04.050
a lot of people's attention,

1237
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.916
which is the only reason these things,

1238
01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:08.401
speaking as an astrologer, happen,

1239
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:10.620
is to catch our attention.

1240
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.918
That's why global warming, you know.

1241
01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:17.894
It's whatever it takes to get the people to wake up,

1242
01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:21.051
which is what I meant before by...

1243
01:04:21.051 --> 01:04:24.603
<v Regina>So we have Saturn, Uranus, Pluto topped with...</v>

1244
01:04:24.603 --> 01:04:29.603
<v ->Okay, and I think that Cancer, the last pull</v>

1245
01:04:30.821 --> 01:04:35.821
of the square, leads us back to the days when,

1246
01:04:36.144 --> 01:04:39.119
and I think we have cellular memory of this,

1247
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:43.151
when people understood the earth as a mother.

1248
01:04:43.151 --> 01:04:46.929
Cancer is the sign of the mother on many levels.

1249
01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:50.481
The primordial mother earth,

1250
01:04:50.481 --> 01:04:53.287
that's now thought of even by the scientists

1251
01:04:53.287 --> 01:04:56.219
in terms of the Gaia theory,

1252
01:04:56.219 --> 01:05:01.157
and by the Wiccans in a spiritual way, in a religious way

1253
01:05:01.157 --> 01:05:03.994
as the mother goddess.

1254
01:05:03.994 --> 01:05:08.994
Now we have the idea that she took care of us

1255
01:05:09.521 --> 01:05:12.188
in the way that is filled with a kind of

1256
01:05:12.188 --> 01:05:14.674
an intimate sense of love.

1257
01:05:14.674 --> 01:05:16.969
You know, Cancer is a water sign,

1258
01:05:16.969 --> 01:05:21.969
so this is a very personal kind of an emotional feeling.

1259
01:05:22.216 --> 01:05:24.008
It's the only piece of the grand cross

1260
01:05:24.008 --> 01:05:26.653
that has this quality.

1261
01:05:26.653 --> 01:05:31.653
And that, as an infant feels towards its mother,

1262
01:05:33.044 --> 01:05:38.044
we have this gut-deep sense of allegiance to the earth

1263
01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.663
now that she's in peril,

1264
01:05:41.663 --> 01:05:45.610
and that we must take care of her as well,

1265
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.935
that it goes both ways.

1266
01:05:47.935 --> 01:05:51.092
<v Regina>Extending into the human family, it's also --</v>

1267
01:05:51.092 --> 01:05:55.497
I believe even the Dalai Lama was quoted as saying recently,

1268
01:05:55.497 --> 01:05:59.497
that he feels that the leaders

1269
01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:03.507
of the way out and beyond into our more spiritual state

1270
01:06:03.507 --> 01:06:07.209
is going to come about through western women,

1271
01:06:07.209 --> 01:06:08.755
the leadership of western women.

1272
01:06:08.755 --> 01:06:09.619
<v ->Right.</v>

1273
01:06:09.619 --> 01:06:11.635
<v Regina>So this extends to the feminine in general.</v>

1274
01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.725
<v ->It's going to have to reclaim the feminine,</v>

1275
01:06:13.725 --> 01:06:17.630
even on the level of gender leadership.

1276
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.233
It's interesting you say leadership.

1277
01:06:20.233 --> 01:06:25.197
That's the one piece we didn't spell out.

1278
01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.638
The cardinal signs involved in these formations

1279
01:06:28.638 --> 01:06:31.219
are the signs of leadership.

1280
01:06:31.219 --> 01:06:35.069
Even on an individual level, to step up

1281
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:37.373
and be the leader of your own life,

1282
01:06:37.373 --> 01:06:41.149
which is another way of saying to live authentically

1283
01:06:41.149 --> 01:06:43.378
and in an empowered way.

1284
01:06:43.378 --> 01:06:46.684
It isn't possible, in my belief system,

1285
01:06:46.684 --> 01:06:50.652
for the big, mean old dark powers

1286
01:06:50.652 --> 01:06:54.524
to scrub you out when you do that.

1287
01:06:54.524 --> 01:06:56.689
It isn't possible.

1288
01:06:56.689 --> 01:06:58.891
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1289
01:07:00.422 --> 01:07:03.633
When we're talking about, I want to just

1290
01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:07.600
make this one statement as we're talking about women

1291
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.202
rising more to the forefront.

1292
01:07:09.202 --> 01:07:11.197
We're not talking necessarily politically,

1293
01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:14.589
but just more in terms of a maturity of influence

1294
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:16.562
on a spiritual level.

1295
01:07:16.562 --> 01:07:19.719
That also includes the feminine in all beings,

1296
01:07:19.719 --> 01:07:20.860
men and women.

1297
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.417
It's the feminine aspect.

1298
01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:27.388
<v ->Yes, it's the yin that this past 5,000-year period</v>

1299
01:07:27.388 --> 01:07:32.388
of patriarchy and dominance-submission models

1300
01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:35.505
has almost wiped out,

1301
01:07:35.505 --> 01:07:38.384
but we've gotten very stereotypical, haven't we,

1302
01:07:38.384 --> 01:07:43.384
when we think about the anima and the animas in gender,

1303
01:07:43.687 --> 01:07:47.260
which is Jung's way of saying basically the same thing,

1304
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.811
that we're all bisexual spiritually speaking.

1305
01:07:50.811 --> 01:07:55.755
It sometimes seems kind of ridiculous to me

1306
01:07:56.528 --> 01:08:01.403
that people forget that it's a continuum,

1307
01:08:01.403 --> 01:08:04.368
whether you're talking about sexual persuasion,

1308
01:08:04.368 --> 01:08:07.642
homosexuality or heterosexuality,

1309
01:08:07.642 --> 01:08:09.552
and never the twain shall meet.

1310
01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:12.335
Which Kinsey, by the way, blew that out of the water.

1311
01:08:12.335 --> 01:08:13.683
He showed that wasn't true.

1312
01:08:13.683 --> 01:08:14.430
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1313
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:16.360
<v ->Or whether you're talking about</v>

1314
01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.289
the softness and ability to weep --

1315
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:22.569
<v Regina>Flexibility.</v>

1316
01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:24.329
<v ->...and the ability to feel empathy</v>

1317
01:08:24.329 --> 01:08:28.211
that we can see in gender males,

1318
01:08:28.211 --> 01:08:33.211
and the warriorship that we can see in gender females.

1319
01:08:33.226 --> 01:08:37.268
We've got to stop being so stereotypical about these things.

1320
01:08:37.268 --> 01:08:42.268
If we look at the whole arc of

1321
01:08:42.612 --> 01:08:44.959
what I call the sky-god religions,

1322
01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:49.812
when they sort of took over about five millennia ago,

1323
01:08:49.812 --> 01:08:52.640
the whole arc of that has gone way too far

1324
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.730
in the yang direction,

1325
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:59.348
and is dying for the yin to be called back in.

1326
01:08:59.348 --> 01:09:04.180
I would tie up that loose end by reiterating

1327
01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.879
this piece of the astrology,

1328
01:09:06.879 --> 01:09:11.879
that the T-square in the sky has as its linchpin,

1329
01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:18.513
Cancer, one of the most feminine signs in the zodiac,

1330
01:09:20.627 --> 01:09:24.382
and the sign that governs the type of wisdom

1331
01:09:24.382 --> 01:09:27.144
which mothers have.

1332
01:09:27.144 --> 01:09:30.440
Not just literal mothers, as you say,

1333
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.602
but the ability --

1334
01:09:31.602 --> 01:09:33.629
<v Regina>The nurturing quality, the healing.</v>

1335
01:09:33.629 --> 01:09:38.269
<v ->...to nurture, to feed, to protect,</v>

1336
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:40.519
to care for.

1337
01:09:40.519 --> 01:09:45.519
It's come out in these men's crises that the world faces,

1338
01:09:46.236 --> 01:09:48.465
that human beings are running around

1339
01:09:48.465 --> 01:09:52.614
like chickens with their heads cut off trying to explain,

1340
01:09:52.614 --> 01:09:55.238
when it's as obvious as pie,

1341
01:09:55.238 --> 01:09:59.750
that it's about care-taking coming back,

1342
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.448
and not fouling your own nest.

1343
01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:06.045
Any mother bird knows that.

1344
01:10:06.045 --> 01:10:11.045
For us all to take a cue from the wisdom of Cancer.

1345
01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:14.228
<v Regina>There was one area that we did not talk about</v>

1346
01:10:14.228 --> 01:10:15.719
that we had talked about off-camera,

1347
01:10:15.719 --> 01:10:17.084
and I don't know if it's appropriate

1348
01:10:17.084 --> 01:10:18.641
or if you still choose to go into it,

1349
01:10:18.641 --> 01:10:23.291
and it is the subject of jihad in this entire mix.

1350
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:28.291
<v ->It's one of those big paradigm-shifting subjects,</v>

1351
01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.112
one of several themes that is putting people

1352
01:10:32.112 --> 01:10:34.224
in such a panic that they can't see

1353
01:10:34.224 --> 01:10:37.125
something very, very simple.

1354
01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:42.125
That is that it's nonsense

1355
01:10:42.416 --> 01:10:47.247
to imagine that you can

1356
01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:52.247
squash out the Arab world's grievances

1357
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.441
with bombs and more pain.

1358
01:10:56.441 --> 01:10:59.183
I think that most thinking people

1359
01:10:59.183 --> 01:11:01.412
have already reached this conclusion,

1360
01:11:01.412 --> 01:11:05.934
but I'll just spell it out in the terms of an astrologer.

1361
01:11:05.934 --> 01:11:09.241
That is really what no more or less,

1362
01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:13.400
I almost hesitate to say, than Osama Bin Ladin himself

1363
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.795
spelled out when he said, "We want you to stop

1364
01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:21.645
"putting your occupying forces in lands

1365
01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.778
"sacred to Islam.

1366
01:11:23.778 --> 01:11:28.589
"We want you to stop bombing innocent Muslim people,

1367
01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:31.532
"and we want you to stop bank-rolling

1368
01:11:31.532 --> 01:11:36.503
"Israel's slaughtering of the Palestinians."

1369
01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:38.871
Really very simple.

1370
01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:42.102
You know, these are simple sort of common sense things

1371
01:11:42.102 --> 01:11:46.092
which, to bring it back to the feminine,

1372
01:11:46.092 --> 01:11:49.185
I think that any woman or any man

1373
01:11:49.185 --> 01:11:52.363
who is in touch with his inner mothering

1374
01:11:52.363 --> 01:11:55.616
would see this if we allowed ourselves to sink back in.

1375
01:11:55.616 --> 01:11:57.931
<v Regina>You would think.</v>

1376
01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:00.139
<v ->It takes turning off the TV, first step.</v>

1377
01:12:00.139 --> 01:12:01.536
<v Regina>Absolutely, because there is</v>

1378
01:12:01.536 --> 01:12:03.861
a fair amount of persuasion, i.e. brain-washing,

1379
01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.112
that's going on regarding all of this.

1380
01:12:06.112 --> 01:12:07.573
<v ->This is the clean information part.</v>

1381
01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:10.314
<v Regina>We are a mind controlled culture in that sense,</v>

1382
01:12:10.314 --> 01:12:12.373
a perception-controlled culture.

1383
01:12:12.373 --> 01:12:13.589
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1384
01:12:13.589 --> 01:12:16.906
When that TV is turned off, when the clean information

1385
01:12:16.906 --> 01:12:19.370
is made a part of a life --

1386
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.596
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1387
01:12:20.596 --> 01:12:25.582
<v ->...very common sense answers start to rise up.</v>

1388
01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:29.257
It just makes me furious when I see,

1389
01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:32.137
very frustrated I think, when I see

1390
01:12:32.137 --> 01:12:37.137
essays by, you know, writers who should know better,

1391
01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:43.048
who are saying things like, "What does the Arab world want?"

1392
01:12:43.048 --> 01:12:45.971
<v Regina>They want what every human being wants.</v>

1393
01:12:45.971 --> 01:12:47.208
<v ->This is it.</v>

1394
01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:50.365
I remember reading, when Sigmund Freud had the gall

1395
01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:52.381
to say, "What do women want?"

1396
01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:54.237
You know, he's puffing on his cigar,

1397
01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:57.863
and you want to say, "Uh, they want the right to vote.

1398
01:12:57.863 --> 01:13:01.394
"They want to own their own property."

1399
01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:04.509
We're talking about the same thing.

1400
01:13:04.509 --> 01:13:06.760
<v Regina>Basic freedoms.</v>

1401
01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.480
<v ->Freedom, and not just the freedom to buy stuff.</v>

1402
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.058
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1403
01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:13.223
Well, you said that.

1404
01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:17.074
Well, let's see, with everything we've talked about,

1405
01:13:17.074 --> 01:13:19.602
each thing has so much depth.

1406
01:13:19.602 --> 01:13:24.465
Let's go back to, let's now wrap it up by looking at,

1407
01:13:24.465 --> 01:13:26.716
and I think we have covered a fair amount of this,

1408
01:13:26.716 --> 01:13:31.716
at what kind of a state of being

1409
01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:35.931
we would best embrace to be able to meet

1410
01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:40.390
these collective challenges in a way that is healing,

1411
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:45.221
that helps us ascend our own belief systems,

1412
01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:47.451
whatever obstacles there have been

1413
01:13:47.451 --> 01:13:51.557
to the healing of, not just what we've looked at here,

1414
01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:52.901
of the economy and so forth,

1415
01:13:52.901 --> 01:13:56.111
but actually the maturation of our species.

1416
01:13:56.111 --> 01:13:59.087
What can we do with all these challenges at our doorstep?

1417
01:13:59.087 --> 01:14:01.935
A lot of people say, "But I'm one person,

1418
01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:03.428
"how am I going to stop it?"

1419
01:14:03.428 --> 01:14:07.652
What can every one person do to play their part out

1420
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.146
in this process of maturation?

1421
01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:11.288
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1422
01:14:11.288 --> 01:14:16.258
You know, the whole idea of, where does the individual

1423
01:14:16.258 --> 01:14:20.087
fit in to the group crises, is itself something

1424
01:14:20.087 --> 01:14:21.868
we talked about when we mentioned

1425
01:14:21.868 --> 01:14:24.130
the meaning of the Aquarius transits.

1426
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:25.079
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1427
01:14:25.079 --> 01:14:29.345
<v ->They are asking all of us to work on this conundrum.</v>

1428
01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:33.089
If I can't be a self-actualized individual,

1429
01:14:33.089 --> 01:14:36.811
how can I possibly help any group I'm a part of?

1430
01:14:36.811 --> 01:14:39.222
That's a very key point.

1431
01:14:39.222 --> 01:14:40.662
<v Regina>It's a very defeatist attitude</v>

1432
01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:43.243
to think because I'm one, and I can't change

1433
01:14:43.243 --> 01:14:46.443
the outcome of the whole, I shouldn't bother myself.

1434
01:14:46.443 --> 01:14:48.459
I mean that's, no.

1435
01:14:48.459 --> 01:14:50.133
<v ->You really can't break through this</v>

1436
01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:52.949
until you reach a spiritual place with it.

1437
01:14:52.949 --> 01:14:56.608
I have to say that, it sounds like an ultimatum,

1438
01:14:56.608 --> 01:14:59.487
but these transits really can't,

1439
01:14:59.487 --> 01:15:02.026
their code can't be cracked unless

1440
01:15:02.026 --> 01:15:04.319
you come at them from a spiritual point of view.

1441
01:15:04.319 --> 01:15:06.154
Otherwise, they don't make any sense.

1442
01:15:06.154 --> 01:15:09.543
They'll just raise more conflict

1443
01:15:09.543 --> 01:15:12.818
and misunderstanding.

1444
01:15:12.818 --> 01:15:16.881
You already have to assume, I think,

1445
01:15:16.881 --> 01:15:21.881
that this is a birth agony, a birth throes,

1446
01:15:21.948 --> 01:15:24.828
of the human species that, again,

1447
01:15:24.828 --> 01:15:28.934
we each decided to be part of in some unfathomable way.

1448
01:15:28.934 --> 01:15:32.464
When we were not yet incarnate,

1449
01:15:32.464 --> 01:15:35.558
we decided we wanted to be here for the show.

1450
01:15:35.558 --> 01:15:39.291
To get back to remembering,

1451
01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:42.149
remembering isn't quite the right word, is it?

1452
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:44.421
Because it isn't conscious perhaps,

1453
01:15:44.421 --> 01:15:47.909
but to sink into a part of a level of self

1454
01:15:47.909 --> 01:15:52.909
that is in touch already, and has never been out of touch,

1455
01:15:52.986 --> 01:15:57.243
with the fact that

1456
01:15:57.243 --> 01:15:59.728
we did make that pact,

1457
01:15:59.728 --> 01:16:01.776
and we are here now.

1458
01:16:01.776 --> 01:16:03.078
<v Regina>And we better step up.</v>

1459
01:16:03.078 --> 01:16:05.093
<v ->And we better step up, what else is there to do?</v>

1460
01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:06.034
<v Regina>Not just for the collective,</v>

1461
01:16:06.034 --> 01:16:07.100
but individually as well.

1462
01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.337
We owe it to ourselves.

1463
01:16:08.337 --> 01:16:10.376
<v ->Well, here's where you get to the natal chart,</v>

1464
01:16:10.376 --> 01:16:12.861
which is just spelled out in black and white.

1465
01:16:12.861 --> 01:16:17.384
Everybody's own individual birth chart

1466
01:16:17.384 --> 01:16:20.637
tells us very clearly where their strengths

1467
01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:24.658
and talents lies, and where the pains,

1468
01:16:24.658 --> 01:16:27.580
the Chironic points are.

1469
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.812
Of course, people don't want to think about this.

1470
01:16:30.812 --> 01:16:33.383
A lot of even spiritual thinkers would rather,

1471
01:16:33.383 --> 01:16:34.940
"Oh, I don't want to talk about my pain anymore.

1472
01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.939
"I worked that out in 10 years of psychotherapy."

1473
01:16:38.939 --> 01:16:43.163
But we're talking about accepting pain in this case,

1474
01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:48.163
and in this year particular, not as if it was a pathology.

1475
01:16:48.391 --> 01:16:51.612
I know that sounds so bizarre to a lot of people,

1476
01:16:51.612 --> 01:16:54.769
but to use it as a medicine path,

1477
01:16:54.769 --> 01:16:59.067
to let it lead you to this point of remembering

1478
01:16:59.067 --> 01:17:03.366
that we're all in the same stew here.

1479
01:17:03.366 --> 01:17:06.448
This is the Neptune-Chiron.

1480
01:17:06.448 --> 01:17:08.912
Once you work through your chart,

1481
01:17:08.912 --> 01:17:12.005
with its pains, with its skills, with its genius,

1482
01:17:12.005 --> 01:17:14.277
the placement of Uranus in your chart

1483
01:17:14.277 --> 01:17:18.362
shows you where you are a genius potentially.

1484
01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.249
Its artistry, look at your Venus,

1485
01:17:23.249 --> 01:17:26.587
its force of character and bravery, which is your Mars,

1486
01:17:26.587 --> 01:17:28.977
and on, and on, and on.

1487
01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:33.254
Then you, after that interpretation has been

1488
01:17:33.254 --> 01:17:38.171
allowed to sink in, you lay against the backdrop of it,

1489
01:17:38.171 --> 01:17:43.171
the cardinal cross, or the transits that are happening now.

1490
01:17:44.698 --> 01:17:47.301
That's the answer to your question.

1491
01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:50.661
How do I, as a self-actualized individual,

1492
01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:55.661
fit in with this incredible world-altering backdrop?

1493
01:17:58.745 --> 01:18:00.996
<v Regina>Well, and we already talked about the dates.</v>

1494
01:18:00.996 --> 01:18:03.225
We're looking at February 16th and 17th,

1495
01:18:03.225 --> 01:18:05.550
for any kind of ritual around this.

1496
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:08.356
Also, the lunar eclipse on June 26th,

1497
01:18:08.356 --> 01:18:12.302
so you've given us a few dates that we can work with,

1498
01:18:12.302 --> 01:18:13.603
where there are likely to be many

1499
01:18:13.603 --> 01:18:16.110
working with these dates at the same time.

1500
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:19.182
There's a type of connectivity too.

1501
01:18:19.182 --> 01:18:20.568
Any final thoughts?

1502
01:18:20.568 --> 01:18:23.128
You've stated everything so beautifully, as always.

1503
01:18:23.128 --> 01:18:26.658
Any final thoughts, Jessica?

1504
01:18:26.658 --> 01:18:30.647
<v ->I want to see people get into an aliveness</v>

1505
01:18:30.647 --> 01:18:35.569
about this and see how damned exciting it is.

1506
01:18:36.247 --> 01:18:41.247
I think to realize that we're on the same team

1507
01:18:41.815 --> 01:18:43.489
as the transits up there.

1508
01:18:43.489 --> 01:18:45.740
The transits up there are just symbols, of course.

1509
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.478
They're not making anything happen,

1510
01:18:47.478 --> 01:18:52.478
but the cosmos, as the Bioneers

1511
01:18:52.719 --> 01:18:57.339
say so eloquently, it's all connected.

1512
01:18:57.339 --> 01:18:59.802
It's all intelligent.

1513
01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:04.796
It's all alive, and we're part of it.

1514
01:19:04.796 --> 01:19:06.289
How exciting is that?

1515
01:19:06.289 --> 01:19:08.582
<v Regina>Yes, and we need to find the passion</v>

1516
01:19:08.582 --> 01:19:10.534
that's been more or less stomped out.

1517
01:19:10.534 --> 01:19:11.558
<v ->But it's in there.</v>

1518
01:19:11.558 --> 01:19:12.550
<v Regina>It's in there.</v>

1519
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:13.648
It's definitely in there.

1520
01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:15.408
If you're breathing, you still have it in there.

1521
01:19:15.408 --> 01:19:16.965
<v ->If you're breathing, it's in there.</v>

1522
01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:18.107
<v Regina>It's still in there.</v>

1523
01:19:18.107 --> 01:19:19.771
On that note, thank you so much, Jessica,

1524
01:19:19.771 --> 01:19:22.021
and we will touch base as all of this progresses,

1525
01:19:22.021 --> 01:19:24.144
once again, probably about a year from now

1526
01:19:24.144 --> 01:19:25.946
and see what the opportunity is then.

1527
01:19:25.946 --> 01:19:27.024
<v ->Wonderful.</v>

1528
01:19:27.024 --> 01:19:27.734
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1529
01:19:27.734 --> 01:19:29.008
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1530
01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:32.567
<v ->If you would like to get a bit of historical perspective</v>

1531
01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:34.167
on what's led up to the situations

1532
01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:35.820
we find ourselves in today,

1533
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.580
please feel free to watch our first two

1534
01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.159
interviews with Jessica.

1535
01:19:39.159 --> 01:19:41.409
Also, she explains much of what we spoke of

1536
01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:43.500
in her book, "Soul-Sick Nation,"

1537
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.078
which you can buy through Amazon

1538
01:19:45.078 --> 01:19:46.710
and other major book-sellers.

1539
01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:48.150
You can also follow her blog at

1540
01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:50.145
MotherSky.com.

1541
01:19:50.145 --> 01:19:54.021
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1542
01:19:54.326 --> 01:19:56.528
(gentle instrumental music)
