00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.618
<v ->Many of you have heard whispers and even roars</v>

2
00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:05.570
of the control over the supplement industry

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.987
becoming much tighter.

4
00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:09.003
Possibly to the point where physicians

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:12.393
would have the sole power to prescribe such nutrients.

6
00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:14.940
It's right that this information should raise alarm

7
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.870
for any responsible person that has invested their time

8
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.995
and money caring for themselves in a healthy way.

9
00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:23.925
In this interview Scott Tips, a food and drug lawyer

10
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.244
for 23 years, gives us the skinny on the status of this

11
00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:29.815
threat to our rights as consumers as well as

12
00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.199
what we can do about it.

13
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.684
Let me warn you that the video is very noisy,

14
00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:37.039
as we were at the gargantuan natural products expo.

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.841
<v Voiceover>Every now and then these headlines seem to</v>

16
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.285
come and go from the newspapers and the magazines

17
00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:51.497
that the health food industry, particularly supplements,

18
00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:54.375
are going to come under the auspices of the

19
00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.475
FDA and so forth.

20
00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.221
And people become frightened and then

21
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.285
it goes away and comes back.

22
00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:05.534
Can you tell us what is truly happening in terms of the FDA

23
00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:09.199
gaining any sort of control over the supplement industry?

24
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:10.341
<v ->I'd be happy to.</v>

25
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.021
Basically the FDA does have control over

26
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.250
the supplement industry.

27
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.510
It's just a fight over the degree of that control.

28
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.301
And ever since the passage of the

29
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:22.948
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994,

30
00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:25.337
which of course tells you when it was passed,

31
00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:27.980
the FDA has been trying to recover powers,

32
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.653
arbitrary powers, that it had before then.

33
00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.643
Prior to the passage of the act

34
00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:37.141
the FDA had a lot of arbitrary power to remove or control

35
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.594
the dietary supplements that were on the market.

36
00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:43.649
And a lot of the products that were produced

37
00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.260
and marketed prior to 1994,

38
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.090
there wasn't much innovation.

39
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.935
There was not much innovation.

40
00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:54.435
There was not much advancement

41
00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:56.375
in the technology of the supplements,

42
00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:58.013
or the quality of the supplements.

43
00:01:58.013 --> 00:01:59.257
There wasn't much incentive

44
00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:01.037
because what the FDA would do,

45
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.481
is it would come in and say,

46
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.881
you have a drug-like product,

47
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.007
you have a new-type product,

48
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.327
that needs to fall under the drug regulations,

49
00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:11.894
especially if you're making these kind of claims.

50
00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:15.177
So what happened is in 1990,

51
00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:18.953
the allies of the FDA in Congress tried to pass a law,

52
00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:20.279
and did, in fact, pass a law

53
00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:22.909
that tightened down even more on supplements.

54
00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.698
This caused a backlash amongst the American public,

55
00:02:25.698 --> 00:02:28.072
of which the National Health Federation

56
00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:30.641
and a number of other health freedom organizations,

57
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:33.608
as well as some of the consumer trade associations,

58
00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:37.283
like the National Nutritional Foods Association.

59
00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:39.646
They joined together and Congress was inundated

60
00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.199
with so many letters.

61
00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.079
In fact, as many letters as they'd ever gotten

62
00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.382
since the advent of the Vietnam War,

63
00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:49.142
or at least the pursuit of the Vietnam War.

64
00:02:49.142 --> 00:02:52.728
It was incredible the millions and millions of letters.

65
00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:54.628
And it caused them to pass,

66
00:02:54.628 --> 00:02:57.141
provided a lot of impetus for FDA to pass

67
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.671
the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.

68
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:01.322
And what that did,

69
00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:04.540
is it did not end the FDA's regulation

70
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.460
of the industry or of dietary supplements.

71
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.492
Although, most of it's critics still keep

72
00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:14.169
up that mantra, yes, it ended these,

73
00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.039
the regulation of these supplements,

74
00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.652
and they're unregulated and there's no

75
00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:20.280
control over them.

76
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.620
But, in fact, what happened, is all it did,

77
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.377
is it removed the arbitrary power off the FDA.

78
00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:27.430
To arbitrarily go in and say,

79
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.180
"If you don't follow what we say or do what we say,

80
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.586
we're gonna take you off the market,

81
00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.106
and run you out of business."

82
00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:35.962
So the FDA has always hungered

83
00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:38.154
for regaining that power since then.

84
00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:40.646
So these days in the media,

85
00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:44.214
certainly what I would call the controlled media,

86
00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:47.519
certainly influenced by the large pharmaceutical companies

87
00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.750
and others with very vested interest,

88
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.260
you'll keep hearing the mantra time over time,

89
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.067
supplements are unregulated, supplements are unregulated.

90
00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.094
In fact, they are not unregulated.

91
00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:01.257
Right now, today, the FDA has the power to go in,

92
00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:03.866
and if someone's making a misrepresentation

93
00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:07.166
or selling a drug or selling a dietary supplement

94
00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:10.250
that is dangerous to take it off the market,

95
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.583
to even imprison the people who are selling it.

96
00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.811
And, in fact, they've done that.

97
00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:17.316
<v Voiceover>And that's primarily if they're making false</v>

98
00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.975
claims or extraordinary claims right?

99
00:04:19.975 --> 00:04:24.165
<v ->False claims or extraordinary claims as you've said.</v>

100
00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:27.362
Or if they are

101
00:04:27.362 --> 00:04:30.242
selling an ingredient that is dangerous.

102
00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:31.823
I mean, look what they did with Ephedra even.

103
00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:32.824
<v Voiceover>Ephedra right.</v>

104
00:04:32.824 --> 00:04:34.721
<v ->I mean that's a prime example, if they don't have</v>

105
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.227
regulatory power then how did they do what they

106
00:04:36.227 --> 00:04:37.530
did with Ephedra?

107
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.866
How did they do what they did with a lot of different

108
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:43.995
ingredients, different products and particularly every

109
00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:46.576
week they come out with a list of products that they've

110
00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:47.731
acted against.

111
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:50.171
That they've sent letters to, they've visited.

112
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.545
They've even taken off the market or called for recalls of

113
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:58.686
that product and so they have a lot of power right now.

114
00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:01.587
So it's actually a regulated market.

115
00:05:01.587 --> 00:05:03.807
It's just not regulated to the same

116
00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:06.317
extent that drugs are regulated.

117
00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:08.008
But then, why should they be?

118
00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:10.259
They shouldn't, they aren't dangerous products.

119
00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.496
<v Voiceover>What about the notion of products that really</v>

120
00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:16.401
cannot be measured within the structure that

121
00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:17.589
already exists?

122
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.109
A lot of the new products coming out with

123
00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:24.680
processes that are say electromagnetic and, where you have

124
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.398
other elements involved in the production of it.

125
00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:29.853
How does this come into play?

126
00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:31.605
<v ->That's an excellent question.</v>

127
00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:36.555
Well, those type that you would,

128
00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:39.980
it's a bit of a complex answer, Because the type

129
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.660
that fall within conventional electromagnetic energy they

130
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.600
would be regulated as medical devises so they would fall

131
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.721
within the in the Medical Devise Act of 1976.

132
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.474
But there is another component to what you're asking.

133
00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:54.346
Those are ones that fall more within,

134
00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:58.476
say oriental style of energy meridians

135
00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:02.248
and more esoteric kind of new age kind of energy.

136
00:06:02.248 --> 00:06:06.631
And those are not regulated by the FDA,

137
00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:08.771
and unless they make drug claims.

138
00:06:08.771 --> 00:06:12.269
If they say, "Doing this will cure you of cancer," then yes

139
00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:15.316
the FDA and probably the FTC

140
00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:18.296
will come in and take action.

141
00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:21.016
Certainly the FDA if they hear about it.

142
00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:22.679
And a lot of times, it's important to know,

143
00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:24.959
a lot of times they hear about it through competitors.

144
00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.250
That's one of the main ways.

145
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.608
Or they'll have an internet surfing day where their agents

146
00:06:29.608 --> 00:06:32.560
will surf on the internet and look for key words

147
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.736
and they'll find it, and then they'll hunt down

148
00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:36.260
those people that way.

149
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.520
That's another way the find their victims.

150
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.388
But, generally the oriental style

151
00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:45.728
or the more Asian style

152
00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:50.559
energy meridians, which I think is more profound anyway,

153
00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:55.397
which is a very substantial healing modality.

154
00:06:55.397 --> 00:06:57.930
Interestingly enough that's most likely

155
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.970
to be untouched by the FDA.

156
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:00.902
<v Voiceover>Interesting</v>

157
00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:02.993
<v ->Just because it's more esoteric.</v>

158
00:07:02.993 --> 00:07:05.444
<v Voiceover>So going back into the supplements,</v>

159
00:07:05.444 --> 00:07:08.989
every now and then you hear this might, that this particular

160
00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:11.859
supplement might be subjected to having a prescription,

161
00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:12.944
for example in the future.

162
00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:13.635
<v ->Right</v>

163
00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:15.418
<v Voiceover>It might be mandated that that be delivered</v>

164
00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:17.274
only by prescription.

165
00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:20.624
Whats actually happening there?

166
00:07:20.624 --> 00:07:21.126
<v ->Well</v>

167
00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:22.597
<v Voiceover>Who's behind that?</v>

168
00:07:22.597 --> 00:07:25.897
<v ->That's a good question yet again.</v>

169
00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:27.197
There's a lot of,

170
00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:31.795
there's two different mind sets behind it, I think.

171
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:36.297
There's the regulatory mindset of the FDA that lives to grow

172
00:07:36.297 --> 00:07:39.539
in it's power, because that's how they get promotions,

173
00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:44.355
that's how they get more jobs, more money and the like

174
00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:46.150
is by doing the regulation.

175
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.510
You know, business is good if they're regulating people.

176
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.942
Business is not good if there's nothing to regulate.

177
00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:54.054
So there's the old saying,

178
00:07:54.054 --> 00:07:56.307
"If it moves tax it.

179
00:07:58.702 --> 00:08:00.712
If it moves even faster regulate it."

180
00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:02.770
So this is one of the things that they do.

181
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.448
But also behind it are competitive interests as well.

182
00:08:06.448 --> 00:08:09.891
Because the up and coming market that we've seen since,

183
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:12.538
really since I first started practicing food and drug law

184
00:08:12.538 --> 00:08:16.354
23, 24 years ago has been

185
00:08:16.354 --> 00:08:19.074
an increase in the power and the

186
00:08:19.074 --> 00:08:23.661
widespread nature of natural alternatives to the normal

187
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.839
allopathic mode of thinking.

188
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:30.179
The take the aspirin, take this drug that we've created,

189
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:33.412
this expensive drug with dangerous side effects.

190
00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.442
There's been this increase in this

191
00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:39.110
alternative mentality, a good mentality, by the way.

192
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.974
So the established interest,

193
00:08:41.974 --> 00:08:43.374
see this as a threat and what

194
00:08:43.374 --> 00:08:45.064
is the best way to protect themselves?

195
00:08:45.064 --> 00:08:46.323
Well one way is to

196
00:08:46.323 --> 00:08:49.726
just advertise more and go to head with a company and

197
00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:52.777
say, "Our product is better for this reason, that reason,"

198
00:08:52.777 --> 00:08:54.210
and have the consumer decide.

199
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.420
And the consumer votes

200
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.113
in the marketplace for what they prefer.

201
00:08:58.113 --> 00:08:59.865
I mean, its the ultimate democracy

202
00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:01.985
is really the free marketplace.

203
00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:05.349
Because the consumer votes with each and every dollar that

204
00:09:05.349 --> 00:09:07.582
she spends or he spends on a product.

205
00:09:10.638 --> 00:09:14.970
So what you find then, is these pharmaceutical interests

206
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.588
these others who are threatened by this up and coming

207
00:09:17.588 --> 00:09:20.587
industry, there's another way they can protect themselves.

208
00:09:20.587 --> 00:09:23.168
And that is to run to the government

209
00:09:23.168 --> 00:09:24.933
and to ask for protection.

210
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:29.464
So what they do, and what they've done--

211
00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:31.993
<v Voiceover>What does that mean to ask for protection?</v>

212
00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:34.589
<v ->Do want me to wait for this?</v>

213
00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:37.632
<v Voiceover>No it's okay. The pastry cart.</v>

214
00:09:37.632 --> 00:09:39.064
<v ->I'm not sure when those things go by</v>

215
00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:40.064
if I should keep talking.

216
00:09:40.064 --> 00:09:43.283
But what does it mean when the ask for protection?

217
00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.705
They will go to their particular representatives

218
00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:47.938
they've given a lot of money to.

219
00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:49.843
<v Voiceover>When you say representatives be very specific.</v>

220
00:09:49.843 --> 00:09:52.155
<v ->Sorry, their representatives in Congress</v>

221
00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:54.041
and their U.S. Senators.

222
00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:55.681
Or in Europe it might be their

223
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:57.553
representatives in parliament.

224
00:09:58.688 --> 00:10:01.528
In Canada, their particular

225
00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:03.821
parliamentary representatives, whom they've contributed

226
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:05.971
a lot of campaign funds to.

227
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.091
Or maybe they haven't and they

228
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:08.971
just have their ear for some reason.

229
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.290
But more likely than not,

230
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.097
they're one of the biggest campaign contributors you

231
00:10:13.097 --> 00:10:15.653
can imagine, so of course they'll have their ear.

232
00:10:15.653 --> 00:10:17.239
They go to them they say,

233
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:19.739
"Look there's a danger, we need it taken care of."

234
00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.476
And one of the things they do,they have

235
00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:25.454
advertising agencies and other people who plant these

236
00:10:25.454 --> 00:10:28.165
articles in the media about how dangerous Ephedra is,

237
00:10:28.165 --> 00:10:31.979
how dangerous this product is, that product, this natural

238
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:34.905
product, this homeopathic remedy and the like.

239
00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:37.389
And they keep trying to sink that message

240
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:39.669
into the public conscience.

241
00:10:39.669 --> 00:10:43.129
So what they do is they keep hounding

242
00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:47.285
that message away through their advertising revenue power

243
00:10:47.285 --> 00:10:49.495
that they have with the media.

244
00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:51.487
They can get these articles in the paper

245
00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:54.171
that talk about how dangerous dietary supplements--

246
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:56.113
<v Voiceover>This is proved disinformation though.</v>

247
00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.923
<v ->It's absolutely disinformation, in fact if you look at</v>

248
00:10:58.923 --> 00:11:01.798
the statistics, which have been done over the years,

249
00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:04.148
dietary supplements are safer than food.

250
00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:06.994
Dietary supplements are safer than hospitals.

251
00:11:06.994 --> 00:11:10.411
Dietary supplements are safer than drugs, far and away

252
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:12.281
by any of those three things.

253
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:14.611
In fact, you're more likely,

254
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:16.988
the average American is more likely to die from a

255
00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:19.804
lightening strike or a bee sting than they are

256
00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.608
from taking a dietary supplement.

257
00:11:21.608 --> 00:11:23.642
That is the fact shown by statistics

258
00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:26.952
over the last 20 to 25 years.

259
00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:29.261
The only thing that would be more likely or

260
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:31.609
less likely to die from is a meteor strike.

261
00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:33.949
You're more likely to die from a dietary supplement

262
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:35.416
than you are from being hit by meteor.

263
00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:36.951
<v Voiceover>Or jumping out an airplane and your</v>

264
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:38.792
shoot doesn't release.

265
00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:41.200
<v ->That's right, your shoot doesn't release so there you go.</v>

266
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.261
But the bottom line is the dietary supplements are

267
00:11:44.261 --> 00:11:48.705
extraordinarily safe, even though there is some high profile

268
00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:52.361
things that happened in past, like Tryptophan back early on

269
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:55.409
when it was banned by the FDA, although they didn't ban

270
00:11:55.409 --> 00:12:00.004
Perrier water and the didn't ban Tampons when had the

271
00:12:00.004 --> 00:12:02.474
problem with toxic shock syndrome and the like.

272
00:12:02.474 --> 00:12:04.679
But they did ban Tryptophan interestingly enough--

273
00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:05.142
<v Voiceover>Interesting</v>

274
00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:08.435
<v ->because Prozac had just been released six months earlier.</v>

275
00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:12.204
when there was a big competitor to L-Trpytophan

276
00:12:12.204 --> 00:12:14.990
But even L-Tryptophan was due to, that problem

277
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.431
was from one manufacturing defect in a genetically modified

278
00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:23.422
organism in one factory in Japan.

279
00:12:23.422 --> 00:12:25.692
And it was not endemic to

280
00:12:25.692 --> 00:12:28.762
L-tryptophan per se, just that particular batch.

281
00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:30.908
Easily cured and easily taken care of.

282
00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:33.091
<v Voiceover>And yet thousands of people die from</v>

283
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:36.015
prescription drug interactions every year.

284
00:12:36.015 --> 00:12:36.849
<v ->Every year</v>

285
00:12:36.849 --> 00:12:38.579
<v Voiceover>And they're not pulled from the market.</v>

286
00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:41.834
<v ->Even from doctors mistakes every year far more than</v>

287
00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:42.746
dietary supplements.

288
00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:45.116
On average, and I'm not trying to

289
00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:49.486
minimize these deaths at all, any death is tragic but on

290
00:12:49.486 --> 00:12:52.151
average, its fewer than five per year

291
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:53.751
for dietary supplements.

292
00:12:53.751 --> 00:12:57.005
And for doctors and hospitals,

293
00:12:57.005 --> 00:12:58.562
to be honest I don't recall the exact figures.

294
00:12:58.562 --> 00:13:00.977
<v Voiceover>I think it's about 750,000 a year.</v>

295
00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:02.768
<v ->I was going to say something very close to that.</v>

296
00:13:02.768 --> 00:13:03.603
<v Voiceover>That's about right.</v>

297
00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:04.435
<v ->Yes I agree.</v>

298
00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:06.170
<v Voiceover>Five a year compared to 750,000.</v>

299
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.982
<v ->It's incredible the difference and so.</v>

300
00:13:08.982 --> 00:13:12.387
<v Voiceover>Yet these industries, the drug industry that</v>

301
00:13:12.387 --> 00:13:14.211
plants this material with the media cannot really taken

302
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:16.214
to task.

303
00:13:16.214 --> 00:13:17.668
<v ->They cannot you're right.</v>

304
00:13:17.668 --> 00:13:19.738
Mainly because there's a revolving door

305
00:13:19.738 --> 00:13:23.273
kind of situation at FDA, where a lot

306
00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:26.096
of the regulators there when the graduate from the FDA

307
00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:27.479
retire from the FDA.

308
00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:29.259
They have cushy jobs waiting for them

309
00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:32.546
in the pharmaceutical industry who can afford to pay them

310
00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:35.677
the kind of money that they would like to get.

311
00:13:35.677 --> 00:13:37.435
And I'm not saying at all that they are on the take,

312
00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:40.520
the FDA people are on the take when they're in their jobs,

313
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.507
there are actually a lot of very fine FDA agents that I've

314
00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:47.193
dealt with over the years who are very ethical, very honest

315
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.213
wanting to do the right thing.

316
00:13:49.213 --> 00:13:51.643
But there are also a lot who know enough

317
00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:53.805
who know their next job is going to be

318
00:13:53.805 --> 00:13:55.688
with the pharmaceutical industry, and they're the ones

319
00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:57.174
with the big bucks.

320
00:13:57.174 --> 00:13:58.124
The other thing is they just have

321
00:13:58.124 --> 00:14:01.559
that mentality that it needs to be subjected,

322
00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:03.979
anything needs to be subjected to 10 years of tests

323
00:14:03.979 --> 00:14:07.609
and millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars of

324
00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:09.602
testing costs before it should be allowed

325
00:14:09.602 --> 00:14:11.172
to be taken by the public.

326
00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:13.139
But that's a really stupid mentality.

327
00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:15.085
Here are natural substances that

328
00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:18.976
we have been with for a millennia

329
00:14:18.976 --> 00:14:20.806
and are very natural to our body

330
00:14:20.806 --> 00:14:24.608
and are proven safe both by their track record and

331
00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:31.072
both by their track record and

332
00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:33.649
by the fact that,

333
00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:37.699
just that there is, just naturally there is no reason

334
00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:41.118
rhyme or reason why they should be a danger.

335
00:14:41.118 --> 00:14:44.334
It's not like we're introducing a toxic substance that was

336
00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:47.072
artificially created into our body, rather where it's a

337
00:14:47.072 --> 00:14:50.505
natural product it may have been tweaked a little bit

338
00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:51.944
to make it more effective,

339
00:14:51.944 --> 00:14:53.824
but otherwise it's entirely natural.

340
00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:58.092
So people with the regulatory mindset are trying

341
00:14:58.092 --> 00:15:02.420
to apply this toxic logical model to natural products.

342
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.968
And instead of being safer,

343
00:15:04.968 --> 00:15:08.228
it's just reducing our ability to get

344
00:15:08.228 --> 00:15:10.618
natural products that would help us.

345
00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.120
And in reducing our ability to get natural products that

346
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.366
would help us there actually harming people.

347
00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:18.341
They're causing more deaths than they are preventing.

348
00:15:18.341 --> 00:15:20.763
And that's really the bottom line.

349
00:15:20.763 --> 00:15:24.850
<v Voiceover>Do you see vitamins and minerals being more</v>

350
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.621
heavily regulated in the future to the point where you might

351
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:29.183
need to have a doctor's prescription

352
00:15:29.183 --> 00:15:30.183
for some of these things?

353
00:15:30.183 --> 00:15:32.333
Is that possible it would happen that way?

354
00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:36.210
<v ->It's extremely possible and if the Codex guidelines go</v>

355
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.089
through as we're seeing them on the path of going

356
00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:41.716
through, then it could very well happen.

357
00:15:41.716 --> 00:15:43.223
<v Voiceover>Explain what this is about.</v>

358
00:15:43.223 --> 00:15:44.728
This whole Codex issue.

359
00:15:44.728 --> 00:15:47.577
<v ->Well I've been attending the Codex Alimentarius meetings</v>

360
00:15:47.577 --> 00:15:49.968
that deal with vitamin and mineral supplements.

361
00:15:49.968 --> 00:15:52.106
<v Voiceover>And explain what the Codex is.</v>

362
00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:55.210
<v ->For about six years now and our organization,</v>

363
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.710
National Health Federation has been following it

364
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.610
for 10 years.

365
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.110
Codex Alimentariuos Commission is a

366
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.655
commission that was created by the United Nations,

367
00:16:03.655 --> 00:16:07.953
by their World Health Organization

368
00:16:07.953 --> 00:16:10.913
and The Food and Agriculture Organization.

369
00:16:10.913 --> 00:16:13.957
It was used for the purposes of creating

370
00:16:13.957 --> 00:16:16.294
standardized guidelines in all areas,

371
00:16:16.294 --> 00:16:18.794
not just for food supplements.

372
00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:22.034
But for food additives, for, it could even be

373
00:16:22.034 --> 00:16:25.927
shrimp and shellfish,

374
00:16:25.927 --> 00:16:27.747
many different things.

375
00:16:27.747 --> 00:16:31.713
Food labeling, infant formulas and the like.

376
00:16:31.713 --> 00:16:34.428
They have some 27 at this count,

377
00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:38.618
at this time about 27 different committees that operate

378
00:16:38.618 --> 00:16:41.819
underneath the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

379
00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:44.219
The Commission itself alternates it's meetings

380
00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:46.039
in Rome and Geneva.

381
00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:49.117
I went to the last meeting in Rome at which they

382
00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:52.569
considered adopting the food supplement guidelines that it's

383
00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:54.701
committee had just approved upon.

384
00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:55.626
<v Voiceover>Which would be?</v>

385
00:16:55.626 --> 00:16:58.665
<v ->Which means that these are putting high restrictions,</v>

386
00:16:58.665 --> 00:17:02.085
very tough restrictions on vitamin and mineral supplements

387
00:17:02.085 --> 00:17:04.064
much tougher than we find in the U.S.

388
00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.099
<v Voiceover>Is this already happening in other countries?</v>

389
00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.119
I mean you said this was more of a global reach.

390
00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:11.729
<v ->It is.</v>

391
00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:14.479
A lot of countries that don't have their own

392
00:17:14.479 --> 00:17:17.849
guidelines or their own fully

393
00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.909
enacted rules and regulations

394
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:25.732
or on the recent skids of adopting these guidelines.

395
00:17:25.732 --> 00:17:28.862
And reason for that is, one they want to be competitive

396
00:17:28.862 --> 00:17:30.272
in the world marketplace.

397
00:17:30.272 --> 00:17:31.999
The other reason is they look to

398
00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:35.139
the U.N. as being more, and the WHO and the FAO, as

399
00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:38.608
being a higher authority for their own rules and regulations

400
00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:40.885
particularly the third world.

401
00:17:40.885 --> 00:17:44.780
What would help with your viewers to understand and

402
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.505
what they need to understand is that what was adopted

403
00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:52.259
last fall, well excuse me the fall before,

404
00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:55.714
that'd be the fall of 2004, the Codex Committee

405
00:17:55.714 --> 00:17:58.728
on food supplements in Bonn, Germany

406
00:17:58.728 --> 00:18:00.898
was really just a loose framework and

407
00:18:00.898 --> 00:18:04.005
right now what they're putting into this framework that

408
00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:07.339
would govern food supplements and what could be sold and

409
00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:11.081
internationally, are the upper limits,

410
00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:13.051
the maximum upper limits.

411
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.452
And a positive list, what they call as the positive list.

412
00:18:16.452 --> 00:18:18.448
Only those vitamins and minerals supplements that

413
00:18:18.448 --> 00:18:22.001
are on the list would be allowed to be sold.

414
00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:23.666
<v Voiceover>How limited is this list?</v>

415
00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:25.367
<v ->Well that's the situation.</v>

416
00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:27.677
The list is not yet been created

417
00:18:27.677 --> 00:18:30.391
and the upper limits have not yet been created so all that's

418
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:33.731
been adopted as we speak now in 2006,

419
00:18:33.731 --> 00:18:36.961
is a framework into which they will drop the limits.

420
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.717
The other thing that it's important to understand,

421
00:18:39.717 --> 00:18:43.632
is that we have a system, these committee meetings

422
00:18:43.632 --> 00:18:47.044
that I've been attending, are really run the

423
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:49.980
engine that's driving them is the Europena Union with it's

424
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.719
very anti-supplement hysterical mentality,

425
00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:57.769
almost paranoid mentality against supplements.

426
00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.914
And so if they control the processes

427
00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:04.028
they have in the past of setting these maximum

428
00:19:04.028 --> 00:19:07.063
upper limits, then they will be set very low.

429
00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:10.667
In fact the chairman of the committee is an individual named

430
00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:13.394
Dr. Rolf Grossklaus, a German.

431
00:19:13.394 --> 00:19:15.674
He's also a director of an institute called

432
00:19:15.674 --> 00:19:17.474
The German Risk Assessment Institute

433
00:19:17.474 --> 00:19:20.658
or in German the initials are BFR.

434
00:19:20.658 --> 00:19:24.128
And they themselves have set some guidelines

435
00:19:24.128 --> 00:19:26.674
of what they think the maximum upper limits should be.

436
00:19:26.674 --> 00:19:29.554
So just to give you a flavor or what could come

437
00:19:29.554 --> 00:19:32.633
down the road, they see Niacin,

438
00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:36.663
vitamin B3, as having an upper limit of 17 milligrams.

439
00:19:36.663 --> 00:19:38.435
That would be the maximum dosage

440
00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:40.685
that would be allowed to be sold.

441
00:19:40.685 --> 00:19:44.384
Vitamin B1, Thaimine, it would be 1.3 milligrams.

442
00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:47.179
<v Voiceover>So for people who need these for blood pressure</v>

443
00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:49.382
or whatever they would be forced over to pharmaceuticals

444
00:19:49.382 --> 00:19:50.546
because they couldn't get the proper help.

445
00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:51.261
<v ->Absolutely</v>

446
00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:52.821
<v Voiceover>And that's the idea behind this?</v>

447
00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:55.211
<v ->I think so because it's eliminating the competition.</v>

448
00:19:55.211 --> 00:19:57.448
This is looping back to what you were talking about before,

449
00:19:57.448 --> 00:20:00.484
what do these companies do that see this up and

450
00:20:00.484 --> 00:20:01.849
coming competition?

451
00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:03.309
If they don't go head to head they

452
00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:05.782
run to the government and they get laws passed

453
00:20:05.782 --> 00:20:07.814
that prohibit the competition.

454
00:20:07.814 --> 00:20:09.963
That's why it's so dangerous to put that power

455
00:20:09.963 --> 00:20:11.163
in the hands of the government,

456
00:20:11.163 --> 00:20:13.633
because it can be so easily misused by

457
00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:17.270
more powerful interests, than these smaller innovative

458
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.041
up and coming companies or

459
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:22.761
new consumer-oriented companies.

460
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:24.539
Now there's another way they could do it.

461
00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:27.232
Instead of going to Congress, to the halls of Congress

462
00:20:27.232 --> 00:20:30.448
and asking their representatives to do it,

463
00:20:30.448 --> 00:20:32.546
they can go to unelected bureaucrats

464
00:20:32.546 --> 00:20:35.386
in an international bureaucracy and have them do it.

465
00:20:35.386 --> 00:20:38.180
In this case the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

466
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.296
That's even further removed, because they don't get elected.

467
00:20:41.296 --> 00:20:44.612
These are bureaucrats like FDA type officials who are

468
00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:47.634
already oriented mentally against supplements so they

469
00:20:47.634 --> 00:20:51.835
already believe the disinformation they're being fed,

470
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.515
because they're part of the problem,

471
00:20:53.515 --> 00:20:55.215
not a solution to the problem.

472
00:20:55.215 --> 00:20:58.309
So what you have is a lot of FDA type bureaucrats

473
00:20:58.309 --> 00:20:59.998
from different countries voting,

474
00:20:59.998 --> 00:21:02.078
and even that's a misnomer, they aren't really voting.

475
00:21:02.078 --> 00:21:04.115
They call it consensus, the chairman looks

476
00:21:04.115 --> 00:21:06.681
around if he doesn't see or she doesn't see any

477
00:21:06.681 --> 00:21:10.133
disagreement in the crowd, then that particular guideline or

478
00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.249
portion of a guideline is adopted

479
00:21:12.249 --> 00:21:16.159
and put into effect.

480
00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:20.202
<v Voiceover>Couple questions following that up.</v>

481
00:21:20.202 --> 00:21:23.224
Is there a way out of this,

482
00:21:23.224 --> 00:21:26.704
in terms of the companies themselves

483
00:21:26.704 --> 00:21:31.341
by simply not suggesting that their product do anything

484
00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:33.199
or have any particular result.

485
00:21:33.199 --> 00:21:34.579
Can you sell something if you don't make

486
00:21:34.579 --> 00:21:39.233
any claims as food in a pill or whatever?

487
00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:43.924
<v ->Well basically yes, in the U.S. you can and certain other</v>

488
00:21:43.924 --> 00:21:44.844
countries you can't.

489
00:21:44.844 --> 00:21:47.464
For example, in Denmark, you must have

490
00:21:47.464 --> 00:21:49.776
a claim associated with a dietary supplement.

491
00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.026
They require you to.

492
00:21:51.026 --> 00:21:53.084
So you can't get around it that way.

493
00:21:53.084 --> 00:21:55.854
But in the US, yes, you're absolutely right.

494
00:21:55.854 --> 00:21:59.120
However, you could run up against another obstacle

495
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.790
and that is, is it a new dietary ingredient.

496
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.640
Since one of the problems with DSHEA is good

497
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.581
of law as it was, that is the Dietary Supplement Health

498
00:22:07.581 --> 00:22:11.183
and Education Act, what we call DSHEA one of the problems

499
00:22:11.183 --> 00:22:15.696
with it, is it set a very arbitrary kind of cut off date.

500
00:22:15.696 --> 00:22:20.416
That any dietary ingredient sold after October 15, 1994,

501
00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:24.174
are considered to be new dietary ingredients and must

502
00:22:24.174 --> 00:22:27.058
contain FDA approval.

503
00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:31.298
Not in drug-like way, an expensive, lengthy drug-like way,

504
00:22:31.298 --> 00:22:34.624
but in a kind of quasi-drug like way

505
00:22:34.624 --> 00:22:37.625
and the FDA has the right to demand safety evidence and all

506
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.681
of that for the new dietary ingredient.

507
00:22:39.681 --> 00:22:42.280
So this is a new development that we are seeing

508
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.490
that the FDA is starting to implement,

509
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.784
where they will use this kind of argument to

510
00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:50.187
shut down companies who have products

511
00:22:50.187 --> 00:22:52.517
or who make claims that they don't like.

512
00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:56.704
<v Voiceover>Second question, what can the consumer slash</v>

513
00:22:56.704 --> 00:23:01.474
voter do at this point with new codec?

514
00:23:01.474 --> 00:23:04.037
These new regulations coming down the pipe.

515
00:23:04.037 --> 00:23:07.293
<v ->Well they can do several things on different fronts.</v>

516
00:23:07.293 --> 00:23:12.143
One is to be what I would call persistently vocal.

517
00:23:12.143 --> 00:23:16.616
That is to contact their congressman, their congress woman

518
00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:21.124
their senator, senators and to tell them

519
00:23:21.124 --> 00:23:22.944
that they don't like

520
00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:27.104
to tell them that they don't like what the FDA is doing

521
00:23:27.104 --> 00:23:31.248
at Codex, that they do not like

522
00:23:31.248 --> 00:23:33.619
these laws that are attempting to be passed

523
00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:36.754
to limit DSHEA and they should be

524
00:23:36.754 --> 00:23:38.234
persistently vocal about it.

525
00:23:38.234 --> 00:23:42.340
So when I say that, what I mean is not to send just

526
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.813
one letter and say I'm done and go home.

527
00:23:44.813 --> 00:23:46.826
Make a phone call, send a fax,

528
00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:49.776
send an email, send a letter, send another letter,

529
00:23:49.776 --> 00:23:51.538
send another phone call.

530
00:23:51.538 --> 00:23:53.338
And to get better informed.

531
00:23:53.338 --> 00:23:55.742
So to go some of the websites that are out there

532
00:23:55.742 --> 00:23:56.821
that will give them information.

533
00:23:56.821 --> 00:23:57.755
<v Voiceover>Including yours?</v>

534
00:23:57.755 --> 00:24:01.835
<v ->Including ours, at the nationalhealthfederation.org.</v>

535
00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:02.975
They can go there.

536
00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:05.085
There are plenty of others out there as well that

537
00:24:05.085 --> 00:24:08.937
have very good information, very good useful information.

538
00:24:08.937 --> 00:24:11.038
International Advocates for Health Freedom.

539
00:24:11.038 --> 00:24:14.389
There's a Coalition for Health Freedom, as well,

540
00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:19.379
but the NHF.com, THE and HF.com

541
00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:23.346
would be another one for the health federation.

542
00:24:23.346 --> 00:24:24.542
They can go there get informed.

543
00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:27.012
They can even give them sample letters to send in.

544
00:24:27.012 --> 00:24:28.948
They can print out and mail

545
00:24:28.948 --> 00:24:30.700
in or they can do it electronically.

546
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.295
<v Voiceover>So old fashion activism.</v>

547
00:24:32.295 --> 00:24:34.405
<v ->Old fashion activism, to be informed,</v>

548
00:24:34.405 --> 00:24:38.225
be persistently vocal and to keep at it.

549
00:24:38.225 --> 00:24:41.298
The other thing to do is to frankly not

550
00:24:41.298 --> 00:24:43.830
take no as answer from their representative.

551
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.196
Because the usual response that we see coming back

552
00:24:46.196 --> 00:24:48.782
from them is, "Oh you've been misinformed."

553
00:24:48.782 --> 00:24:51.918
This is coming from the representative or the senator,

554
00:24:51.918 --> 00:24:53.882
"We think this is a very nice bill

555
00:24:53.882 --> 00:24:55.612
because it will protect the consumer."

556
00:24:55.612 --> 00:24:58.182
That's their big mantra, protect the consumer.

557
00:24:58.182 --> 00:25:00.284
Well the consumer can be protected to death.

558
00:25:00.284 --> 00:25:01.814
We're in favor of health freedom.

559
00:25:01.814 --> 00:25:04.545
We're in favor of the right of consumer to choose.

560
00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:07.927
How is it by reducing consumer choice that

561
00:25:07.927 --> 00:25:09.003
we're protected better?

562
00:25:09.003 --> 00:25:11.093
We want more consumer choice,

563
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:14.784
informed consumer choice and then if some company is

564
00:25:14.784 --> 00:25:17.174
truly doing wrong, then they're already,

565
00:25:17.174 --> 00:25:21.974
there are already existing laws that will shut them down.

566
00:25:21.974 --> 00:25:23.920
And they can be used against them.

567
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.043
And we encourage them to be shut down.

568
00:25:26.043 --> 00:25:27.586
There are also private citizen law suits

569
00:25:27.586 --> 00:25:30.156
that will shut them down.

570
00:25:30.156 --> 00:25:32.583
<v Voiceover>How imminent is this potential threat to our</v>

571
00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:35.241
ability to freely choose the supplements

572
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:36.913
in the United States and abroad?

573
00:25:36.913 --> 00:25:40.178
<v ->Well, it's hard to say,</v>

574
00:25:40.178 --> 00:25:42.678
because it could happen this year

575
00:25:42.678 --> 00:25:44.796
or it might be 5 years from now.

576
00:25:44.796 --> 00:25:47.776
It depends on the momentum and really whether

577
00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:50.751
they sneak laws through like they tend to.

578
00:25:51.871 --> 00:25:54.538
So what happens is a lot of these bills are pushed through

579
00:25:54.538 --> 00:25:57.776
or rammed through at the last minute as Congress is

580
00:25:57.776 --> 00:25:59.243
adjourning such as on Christmas Eve.

581
00:25:59.243 --> 00:26:00.793
I mean they even did that with the

582
00:26:00.793 --> 00:26:04.015
Federal Reserve Act in 1913 at the last

583
00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:05.682
minute with everyone going home.

584
00:26:05.682 --> 00:26:08.838
And that was one of the worst disasters to ever hit America.

585
00:26:10.058 --> 00:26:12.217
This a favorite trick of theirs.

586
00:26:12.217 --> 00:26:16.417
And then it becomes a

587
00:26:16.417 --> 00:26:20.510
fait accompli that the Americans are forced to put up with.

588
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.700
And it's very tough to then roll this back.

589
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.510
Or what they did with the Patriot Act,

590
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.261
where they did a bill that was hundreds

591
00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:29.957
of pages thick, no one had time to even read it.

592
00:26:29.957 --> 00:26:31.641
<v Voiceover>Yea pulled it together in a few days literally.</v>

593
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:33.811
<v ->Yes, well actually they had it prepared ahead of time.</v>

594
00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:35.278
<v Voiceover>No I'm teasing. Of course they did.</v>

595
00:26:35.278 --> 00:26:38.837
<v ->They had it prepared before 9/11.</v>

596
00:26:38.837 --> 00:26:41.517
But then they produced it at the last minute,

597
00:26:41.517 --> 00:26:44.597
barely dry on the paper and none of

598
00:26:44.597 --> 00:26:47.078
the representatives read it all the way through,

599
00:26:47.078 --> 00:26:50.093
nor could they have, and yet they voted on it an passed it.

600
00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:52.263
<v voiceover>And this could happen with our ability obtain</v>

601
00:26:52.263 --> 00:26:54.645
these nutrients?

602
00:26:54.645 --> 00:26:57.066
<v ->Yes most likely what will happen it will be a,</v>

603
00:26:57.066 --> 00:26:59.842
I predict a scenario as I predict like the following,

604
00:26:59.842 --> 00:27:02.240
There'll be some emergency,

605
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.270
there'll be some dangerous thing that happens,

606
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.388
that they they'll blame on dietary supplements

607
00:27:06.388 --> 00:27:07.809
as they did with Ephedra,

608
00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:09.179
as they did with Tryptophan,

609
00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:10.789
as they did even did with Ginseng,

610
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:12.185
back when they had the Korea-gate

611
00:27:12.185 --> 00:27:14.957
problem in the 70s and they banned Ginseng

612
00:27:14.957 --> 00:27:16.687
for a while because of that.

613
00:27:16.687 --> 00:27:19.325
There will be some fake, made-up, emergency

614
00:27:19.325 --> 00:27:22.175
and then they'll try to stampede Congress

615
00:27:22.175 --> 00:27:24.255
and the public into supporting this.

616
00:27:24.255 --> 00:27:27.471
And then they'll, not necessarily

617
00:27:27.471 --> 00:27:31.053
shut down, but at least severely limit the freedoms of DSHEA

618
00:27:31.053 --> 00:27:34.705
and reinstitute the arbitrary powers of the FDA.

619
00:27:34.705 --> 00:27:36.373
So we need to be guarded against that

620
00:27:36.373 --> 00:27:38.263
and be prepared to act on that.

621
00:27:38.263 --> 00:27:40.276
But anyway to answer your question,

622
00:27:40.276 --> 00:27:43.180
bottom line, I don't see that happening overnight.

623
00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.582
There's a lot of support for DSHEA,

624
00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:47.562
a lot of support for our freedoms here.

625
00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:50.099
I see it being more a lengthy process of

626
00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:51.900
slowly chipping away.

627
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.040
And there are bills in the pipe right now,

628
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.733
that are anti-DSHEA, anti-health freedom,

629
00:27:57.733 --> 00:28:00.874
anti-consumer choice as we speak.

630
00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:02.374
And there are several representatives,

631
00:28:02.374 --> 00:28:05.865
in particular, Henry Waxman from Santa Monica, CA,

632
00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:10.490
Susan Davis from San Diego, CA,

633
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.340
Dick Durbin from Illinois, who are particularly aggressive

634
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.271
against supplements and against consumer health freedom.

635
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:20.330
And yet these people get

636
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:25.138
reelected time after time after time, even though they

637
00:28:25.138 --> 00:28:28.760
strive heartily to shut down our right to take what

638
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.950
we want into our own bodies.

639
00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:36.710
<v Voiceover>In short, we just have to make ourselves aware</v>

640
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.771
and not, I think what happens often, when you have

641
00:28:39.771 --> 00:28:42.674
something large and immediate people will stand up

642
00:28:42.674 --> 00:28:45.242
and respond to it, but as you say when it's subtle and they

643
00:28:45.242 --> 00:28:49.342
chip away at you one, little bit of legislation at a time it

644
00:28:49.342 --> 00:28:52.008
kind of goes unnoticed and people get worn down.

645
00:28:52.008 --> 00:28:53.960
<v ->It does, that's absolutely right.</v>

646
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.620
And then the slowly get adjusted to this idea that,

647
00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.263
yes, maybe dietary supplements are dangerous,

648
00:28:59.263 --> 00:29:01.911
when in fact, it's exactly the opposite.

649
00:29:01.911 --> 00:29:04.194
And that's the message we keep getting today.

650
00:29:04.194 --> 00:29:06.394
That's why I appreciate your program,

651
00:29:06.394 --> 00:29:08.060
because it gets out the truth,

652
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.134
and people can be better informed, than reading the local

653
00:29:12.134 --> 00:29:15.956
Times or whatever the newspaper is that is not quite

654
00:29:17.266 --> 00:29:20.473
so vocal or quite so well informed.

655
00:29:20.473 --> 00:29:21.727
So thank you.

656
00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:25.382
<v ->Scott has made it his life's work to protect the rights</v>

657
00:29:25.382 --> 00:29:27.952
of the consumer, to choose how we wish to

658
00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:29.006
care for ourselves.

659
00:29:29.006 --> 00:29:30.486
You can find out much more about this

00:29:30.486 --> 00:29:33.320
important topic by going to his website below.

661
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.010
Until next time, thanks for watching.
