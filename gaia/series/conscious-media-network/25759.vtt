<v ->If you're a regular BBLC viewer, you may have seen</v>

2
00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.479
our interview with Rob Williams and Psych-K,

3
00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.574
a system of repatterning our subconscious beliefs.

4
00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:12.742
Dr. Teri Mahaney carries forth in this tradition

5
00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:14.603
with her work in reprogramming

6
00:00:14.603 --> 00:00:17.672
subconscious belief systems, but while we sleep.

7
00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:20.119
Among her clients have been the Department of Defense,

8
00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.479
the U.S. Army, the IRS, insurance corporations,

9
00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.333
and even the Girl Scouts.

10
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.486
The magic of Teri's work lies in her unrelenting search

11
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.318
for the all-inclusive messages that every brain

12
00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:34.731
can respond to while in a theta, or sleep, state.

13
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:37.013
Truly, a woman who has done her homework.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:43.022 line:15% 
(relaxing guitar music)

15
00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.573
So, how did you end up on this path of curiosity

16
00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:52.344
as to how the depth of the human mind works, to begin with?

17
00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:55.731
<v ->Well, I was always curious, and then I had a daughter</v>

18
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.224
who was born with some brain difficulties.

19
00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.283
I never expected to do this when I grew up.

20
00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:02.076
And in those days, back in the 70's,

21
00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:04.069
we didn't even have labels, we didn't have research,

22
00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.173
and I just started working with her intuitively.

23
00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:08.243
And I got such good results that, pretty soon,

24
00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:10.469
I was being asked would I come in and talk to teachers,

25
00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.788
and it just began to evolve, and then I ended up teaching,

26
00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:16.361
which I did not do until I was 40 years old.

27
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.734
When I got in the classroom, I was

28
00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.899
really dedicated to my students performing,

29
00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.397
and so I was just constantly playing with the brain.

30
00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:24.148
<v Regina>What kind of work were you in?</v>

31
00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:26.482
<v ->At that time, I was an associate professor of business</v>

32
00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:28.602
at the university, which was an extremely interesting

33
00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:31.052
place to be, because I was the token female

34
00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:33.904
in the business department, doing snake oil on the side.

35
00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:35.470
So it was quite fun. (laughs)

36
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.807
<v Regina>Well, the snake oil must have had</v>

37
00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:39.664
some applications, certainly, in the business world.

38
00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:42.520
Did you start playing with some of that in that world?

39
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.281
<v ->That is exactly correct, all of my first clients</v>

40
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:47.739
who came to me were all through the business connection.

41
00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.911
It was people wanting to sell more insurance,

42
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:53.027
businessmen wanting to get along better with their partners.

43
00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:55.116
I had a man who wanted to own a fishing fleet,

44
00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:59.086
and came and did a custom tape on that,

45
00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:00.887
and he ended up with a fishing fleet.

46
00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:03.947
<v Regina>You've had some, actually some very high profile</v>

47
00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:08.094
clientele in the past, and it seems to be

48
00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:12.087
across the board, whether they're professional athletes,

49
00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:16.256
whether they're housewives, whether they're salesmen.

50
00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.765
What is it that you have, what is it that you've developed

51
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.521
that seems to have this across the board

52
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.825
effective success for individuals?

53
00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:27.819
<v ->It fixes it.</v>

54
00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:29.284
<v Regina>Well yeah, I gathered that.</v>

55
00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:31.266
Is there some special thing, though,

56
00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.980
that you figured out in the area of hypnosis?

57
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.567
I mean, I assume some of the work you're doing now

58
00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.150
is that special thing, but, where did you start realizing

59
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.517
that you could have a particular impact on people like this?

60
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.928
<v ->Oh, that's a great question, because I never did,</v>

61
00:02:43.928 --> 00:02:45.845
and again, I never expected to.

62
00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.661
I had made a tape for myself, to this super

63
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:51.715
learning technology, Suggestopedia as we call it in Europe.

64
00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:53.738
And I fell asleep listening to it, and I just thought

65
00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:55.511
it didn't work, and threw it away.

66
00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:57.664
And when it ended up working, I jokingly

67
00:02:57.664 --> 00:02:59.347
told my women friends about it.

68
00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:01.510
We started as a complete joke, and they said,

69
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.439
"Oh, well do you think it's help me, blah blah blah?"

70
00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.064
And I said, no, but we'll try it.

71
00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:07.297
And every one of them we tried worked.

72
00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:10.626
And I still didn't believe it, so I was in denial,

73
00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:12.665
or disbelief, or whatever language you wanna use

74
00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:15.031
for probably the first year, but everybody

75
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:17.062
kept reporting back going "Teri, it worked!"

76
00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:17.958
And I kept going--

77
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Regina>Well, explain what it is for a moment.</v>

78
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.007
<v ->Sure, in the beginning, 1985 to 1989,</v>

79
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:24.856
I worked one on one with private clients.

80
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.441
They would come to me with a problem.

81
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:27.851
"I talk on the phone too much."

82
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:30.311
A young man who couldn't pass a Spanish test.

83
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:33.568
A businessman who hit his head too often.

84
00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.096
A fellow who wanted to sell real estate, but said he would

85
00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:38.160
sit in front of his TV instead of getting out there.

86
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.020
I mean, it was just across the board.

87
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.393
And I would sit down with them,

88
00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:44.379
hand write a custom script for them

89
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.788
making statements to fix this,

90
00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:47.970
and then I would send them home with

91
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.660
a tape recorder and some music.

92
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.223
And they would record that script in their own voice,

93
00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:53.824
and then they would listen to it at night,

94
00:03:53.824 --> 00:03:55.609
while they slept, for 10 nights.

95
00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.459
And the problem would be gone.

96
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.417
They all kept reporting back, it was fixed,

97
00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:02.121
and I'd go, that's impossible, it can't be fixed.

98
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:03.653
But it just kept working.

99
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:07.311
So in '89, I took two years off and went in research mode,

100
00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:09.322
and read everything about the brain, everything

101
00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:12.124
about EEG, everything about subliminal programming.

102
00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:14.465
I actually did the work for four years

103
00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.374
before I did the research.

104
00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:20.878
<v Regina>So, it sounds as though the way in which</v>

105
00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:25.449
you structure the phrases, seems to be really key here,

106
00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.335
<v ->Critical.</v>

107
00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.579
<v Regina>because other people do subliminal programming.</v>

108
00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:29.537
<v ->Critical.</v>

109
00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:31.633
<v Regina>And what is it that you discovered</v>

110
00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:34.380
about the way in which the statements have to be made

111
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.291
that you're going to have an effect that might not,

112
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:40.222
say, at times be even counter-productive for people?

113
00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:42.749
<v ->Several things make this particularly different.</v>

114
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.414
Number one, we play a specific music in the background

115
00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:47.702
that holds the brain in the theta brain wave state.

116
00:04:47.702 --> 00:04:49.748
It's a little technical, but just know that

117
00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.988
we're hittin' the right place.

118
00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:55.110
Number two, each statement is repeated three times

119
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.180
to an eight second cadencing,

120
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.585
that is the brain research for long term learning.

121
00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:01.888
Number three, I did not limit my statements

122
00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:04.618
to positive affirmations, there is a tremendous

123
00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:06.308
body of information out there

124
00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:09.354
that says the subconscious can't hear a negative statement.

125
00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:11.312
Well, (sighs) I'm not gonna say on video

126
00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:12.744
what my response is to that,

127
00:05:12.744 --> 00:05:13.444
(Regina laughs)

128
00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:15.633
because it's very simple, if that were true,

129
00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:19.236
you would not have any possible programming

130
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.765
that you weren't okay.

131
00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:22.874
If the subconscious can't hear a negative,

132
00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:24.893
you never would have heard "You're dumb."

133
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.479
If the subconscious can't hear a negative,

134
00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.620
you never would have heard, "You're a bad person."

135
00:05:30.592 --> 00:05:33.008
I mean, make up your mind, it either can hear a negative,

136
00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:34.704
or it can't hear a negative, you gotta go

137
00:05:34.704 --> 00:05:37.107
one way or the other, do you know what I'm saying? (laughs)

138
00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:38.669
<v Regina>Absolutely, evidence would suggest</v>

139
00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.410
looking at all of us it's society at large.

140
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.069
We've heard an awful lot of, our subconscious

141
00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.809
has heard an awful lot of negative programming

142
00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:45.932
throughout our lives.

143
00:05:45.932 --> 00:05:49.084
<v ->Absolutely, so, this body of information</v>

144
00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:52.080
that goes that way, I go the other way, says, for instance,

145
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.252
"Never use the word not, never make a negative statement."

146
00:05:55.252 --> 00:05:56.397
I don't do that.

147
00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:59.084
Gimme any topic, and I'll give you an example of a script,

148
00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:00.696
just throw something out for me.

149
00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:03.244
<v Regina>Okay, popular one, "I'm fat."</v>

150
00:06:03.244 --> 00:06:06.466
<v ->Fat, arright, being fat and I are one, everybody goes</v>

151
00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.407
(gasps) "Oh, no, I can't do that, oh my gosh!"

152
00:06:09.407 --> 00:06:12.379
Well, what we resist, persists.

153
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:16.376
As soon as we come into oneness with something, supposedly,

154
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.127
that is the healing state in itself, that's where I start.

155
00:06:19.127 --> 00:06:21.541
I release and forgive myself for being fat.

156
00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:24.809
I release and forgive myself for not being fat.

157
00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.552
The subconscious can hear that, it can hear that.

158
00:06:27.552 --> 00:06:30.245
<v Regina>Interesting, because as I was looking through all</v>

159
00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:32.508
of your materials and the various subjects that you cover,

160
00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:34.048
I have a couple girlfriends, in fact,

161
00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:36.168
that were curious about this interview today,

162
00:06:36.168 --> 00:06:38.113
because they have interest in losing weight.

163
00:06:38.113 --> 00:06:39.158
Which is why I brought it up.

164
00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:40.483
But I notice there's nothing in there

165
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.686
called weight loss, why is that?

166
00:06:42.686 --> 00:06:44.086
<v ->That's because I can't guarantee it,</v>

167
00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:46.156
and I will only put out what I can guarantee.

168
00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.366
Weight loss, when I work privately with clients,

169
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.615
is a 50-50 game, they either lose it (finger snaps),

170
00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:51.615
or they don't (finger snaps).

171
00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:54.446
They don't say, "I wanna lose 25 pounds" and lose five.

172
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.358
They don't way "I wanna lose 25 pounds" and lose 10.

173
00:06:57.687 --> 00:06:59.510
They either (snaps fingers) lose it, or (snaps) they don't.

174
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.081
It's a yes-no question, if you don't hit that target,

175
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:05.757
you don't get the results.

176
00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.032
<v Regina>Years ago, I used to do hypnotherapy.</v>

177
00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:10.551
Had a little clinic, and I noticed the same thing.

178
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:12.695
What is it, and I'm going to come back

179
00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:14.879
to some of the broad questions, but while we're on this,

180
00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.172
what is it about weight loss

181
00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:20.212
that is so personally deep

182
00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:22.659
and difficult to transform on some levels?

183
00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:24.950
<v ->Boy, you probably know more about that</v>

184
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.620
than I do, with your background.

185
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.425
Let me give you an example as an answer.

186
00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:30.811
I have a new client, she got on the money series,

187
00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:33.729
she increased her income 600% in six months,

188
00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.813
so she was pretty impressed, and caught with me.

189
00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:38.487
She wanted to work on weight, and I said,

190
00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:41.165
"May I ask you to start on one thing first,

191
00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:42.383
"then we'll move into that?"

192
00:07:42.383 --> 00:07:44.799
And I put her on the CD Love Yourself.

193
00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:47.204
She then called me and said, "I've never even told you

194
00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:50.549
"I'm a binge eater, I have stopped binge eating on this CD."

195
00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:52.246
It doesn't have the word weight on it.

196
00:07:52.246 --> 00:07:53.868
<v Regina>Because, really, it's not about weight,</v>

197
00:07:53.868 --> 00:07:54.726
<v ->It's not about weight.</v>

198
00:07:54.726 --> 00:07:56.329
<v Regina>Weight is just a symptom that has to do</v>

199
00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:59.356
with other feelings of self-worth, et cetera.

200
00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:02.392
So, I found, I assume that was the reason you did not

201
00:08:02.952 --> 00:08:06.368
overtly offer that, because you do have other series

202
00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:09.842
that have to do with self-worth, and self-love, et cetera.

203
00:08:09.842 --> 00:08:12.315
And so that can be, and a manifestation

204
00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:13.313
of that as weight loss.

205
00:08:13.313 --> 00:08:15.795
<v ->That's correct, I now, because of popular pressure,</v>

206
00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:17.758
I'll be perfectly honest, I shouldn't say that,

207
00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.444
commercial popular pressure.

208
00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:20.181
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>

209
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.167
<v ->I have a CD out called Be Physically Well,</v>

210
00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:26.876
and it does include weight management and exercise.

211
00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:29.045
But it is not geared toward that.

212
00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Regina>Okay, now let's go into the,</v>

213
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.962
a little bit more of the nuts and bolts of doing this.

214
00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:36.416
You call this SuperSleep, and you

215
00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:38.759
listen to these while you're sleeping.

216
00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.969
There's something called preconscious processing

217
00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:44.813
involved in this, what does that mean?

218
00:08:45.203 --> 00:08:47.186
<v ->Preconscious processing is a term that</v>

219
00:08:47.186 --> 00:08:49.959
was come up with a guy named Dixon.

220
00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.472
And the reason he did that,

221
00:08:51.472 --> 00:08:52.897
he did years and years of research,

222
00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:54.746
and when he tried to put the research out,

223
00:08:54.746 --> 00:08:57.259
the hypnotherapy community,

224
00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:59.757
the psychological community, psychotherapist community,

225
00:08:59.757 --> 00:09:01.780
all went AAAAH! and went running and screaming,

226
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.726
because he used the word subliminal.

227
00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:05.971
So he simply changed the word to preconscious

228
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:07.405
so it would be acceptable.

229
00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:08.607
<v Regina>Ah, so that's what preconscious is.</v>

230
00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:10.114
<v ->So that's the real truth.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

231
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:11.584
<v ->See, when you talk to a researcher, you get all that</v>

232
00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:14.021
background stuff, you know how it really happened.

233
00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.040
(laughter)

234
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.487
And the real truth is, Dixon simply said,

235
00:09:18.487 --> 00:09:21.190
the only reason this society has not accepted

236
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.224
subliminal programming is, number one, fear of the unknown,

237
00:09:24.224 --> 00:09:27.547
number two, we cannot agree

238
00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:29.697
on the definition of subliminal,

239
00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:31.173
and number three, too many people

240
00:09:31.173 --> 00:09:33.393
will lose too much money if it works.

241
00:09:33.893 --> 00:09:36.629
So he renamed it pre-conscious processing.

242
00:09:37.074 --> 00:09:39.317
<v Regina>Interesting, and also, a general fear</v>

243
00:09:39.317 --> 00:09:41.963
in society at large because of the popularization

244
00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:44.295
in films and such, that the subliminal programming

245
00:09:44.295 --> 00:09:46.475
can program you to a negative effect.

246
00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:47.733
<v ->Yes, you're right.</v>

247
00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:50.774
<v Regina>I notice that you actually have,</v>

248
00:09:50.774 --> 00:09:54.515
in your materials, the script that's embedded,

249
00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:57.579
so people can actually see the lines that are

250
00:09:57.579 --> 00:09:59.606
embedded in the subliminal programming.

251
00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:01.554
I've used it the last few nights, because

252
00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:04.304
I wanted to experience this before we talked.

253
00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:09.058
I noticed that, as your brain becomes more sleepy,

254
00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:11.613
more entrained, ultimately you drop off

255
00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:16.071
and your voice starts receding into the music more and more.

256
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:17.848
Now I'm assuming that's intentional,

257
00:10:17.848 --> 00:10:20.540
so that it's not competing with the brain?

258
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.566
<v ->It is intentional, but you've asked this question</v>

259
00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:27.264
at the perfect time, because I've had so many people

260
00:10:27.264 --> 00:10:30.430
call me back and say "I want to be able to hear every word."

261
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.604
I have just gone back into the sound studio,

262
00:10:32.604 --> 00:10:35.268
we have just started from scratch, and 48 CDs

263
00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:37.655
are being remastered with a higher volume.

264
00:10:37.655 --> 00:10:40.936
So, not only will you get a word for word script,

265
00:10:40.936 --> 00:10:42.917
you will be able, at any time,

266
00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.659
to hear every word on that CD.

267
00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:47.940
You're gonna need to turn it down lower to go to sleep.

268
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.428
From my perception, there could be

269
00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:50.959
a lot of reasons for that, frankly,

270
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.176
I think that is a lot of fear, right now,

271
00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:55.265
of people saying "I don't trust she's telling me

272
00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:57.099
"what she says she's telling me."

273
00:10:57.099 --> 00:10:59.150
And I can honor that, they don't know me.

274
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Regina>It's a fearful society right now.</v>

275
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.873
<v ->And it is showing up in my business,</v>

276
00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:06.897
and I'm completely re-doing my product line based on that.

277
00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:09.117
<v Regina>What kind of effect does that have?</v>

278
00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:11.160
Because ideally, you want the person to relax,

279
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.469
hear the music, float away, and drift off to sleep.

280
00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:16.213
If you're anchored in trying to listen to every word,

281
00:11:16.213 --> 00:11:17.430
<v ->It doesn't work.</v>

282
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.717
<v Regina>It doesn't work.</v>

283
00:11:18.717 --> 00:11:19.447
<v ->No.</v>

284
00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:22.101
<v Regina>So, what happens if you pump the volume</v>

285
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:23.626
of your voice up, then?

286
00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:27.083
How's this going to affect the result?

287
00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:29.432
<v ->The only thing I can do is, quote,</v>

288
00:11:29.432 --> 00:11:30.845
hope for the best, that eventually,

289
00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:32.470
they're gonna get so tired of listening,

290
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.895
they're gonna fall asleeṗ.

291
00:11:33.895 --> 00:11:35.010
(laughter)

292
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.239
I'm counting on that.

293
00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:38.869
That's what I'm holding out for.

294
00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.072
<v Regina>It is done in a monotonous cadence for a reason.</v>

295
00:11:41.072 --> 00:11:41.923
<v ->It is, isn't it?</v>

296
00:11:41.923 --> 00:11:43.283
<v Regina>But the interesting part is,</v>

297
00:11:43.283 --> 00:11:46.177
if you can see, on a sheet of paper, what's being said,

298
00:11:46.177 --> 00:11:49.684
it should, ideally, alleviate a lot of that fear.

299
00:11:49.684 --> 00:11:53.217
But again, we're like I said, we are in mistrustful times,

300
00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:55.429
as you're well aware of.

301
00:11:55.429 --> 00:11:57.664
Now that we're talking a little bit about

302
00:11:57.664 --> 00:11:59.951
the stages of consciousness and the sleep,

303
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:02.801
what about the levels of consciousness that we experience,

304
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:07.434
from our pure, working daytime mentality

305
00:12:07.434 --> 00:12:10.282
we carry with us through to the deepest levels of sleep,

306
00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:12.165
and where does this start interfacing?

307
00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:15.224
<v ->Well, I oversimplify, because</v>

308
00:12:15.224 --> 00:12:17.389
we don't have 33 hours here,

309
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:18.855
so if you don't mind, I'm gonna do that.

310
00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:20.613
I always ask people just to think about

311
00:12:20.613 --> 00:12:22.470
baseball, and being up to bat.

312
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.141
It makes it easier to remember.

313
00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:28.425
B is for Beta, A is for Alpha, and T is for Theta.

314
00:12:28.524 --> 00:12:30.332
Beta is where you and I are right now.

315
00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.318
We're talking, speaking, doing, acting,

316
00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:34.300
hopefully not under too much stress.

317
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.511
Now when we (breathing),

318
00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:40.327
chill, we'll be in alpha, and when

319
00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.071
we go to sleep, we'll be in theta.

320
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:44.118
<v Regina>So where does meditation normally fall in?</v>

321
00:12:44.118 --> 00:12:45.696
<v ->It depends on the meditator, and of course,</v>

322
00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:47.101
where you are at the time.

323
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:49.172
Most people are meditating in a low alpha.

324
00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:51.868
Some people, with a lot of practice, who are at easy access,

325
00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:53.577
will go right into a theta state.

326
00:12:53.577 --> 00:12:55.488
Now, this is the complexity of it.

327
00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:58.273
The whole brain doesn't have to be in one brain state,

328
00:12:58.273 --> 00:13:00.237
so this can be in beta, this can be in alpha,

329
00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:01.528
this can be in theta.

330
00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:04.054
And they can be operating simultaneously.

331
00:13:04.054 --> 00:13:08.274
What we call the awakened mind, Anna Wise did this research,

332
00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:09.808
if any of your people are interested,

333
00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:12.138
I love what she did, pick up her books.

334
00:13:12.138 --> 00:13:15.028
What we call the awakened mind is operating

335
00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:18.495
simultaneously in all brain states.

336
00:13:19.474 --> 00:13:20.931
Simultaneously.

337
00:13:21.945 --> 00:13:23.653
<v Regina>There's also delta.</v>

338
00:13:24.523 --> 00:13:26.907
<v ->Yes, and delta is deep, dreamless sleep,</v>

339
00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:29.568
which I choose to believe is the,

340
00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:32.573
if we have these kinds of theories,

341
00:13:32.573 --> 00:13:34.693
it can be the state of astral travelling,

342
00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:36.709
it can be that the door to the book of life,

343
00:13:36.709 --> 00:13:39.304
or Akashic records, if we choose to believe that.

344
00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:41.548
It is, in my opinion, the door

345
00:13:41.548 --> 00:13:43.582
to the collective unconscious.

346
00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:46.240
Based on Jung's psychology, it is

347
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.029
the door to the collective unconscious.

348
00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:49.933
<v Regina>And you say that the people, for example,</v>

349
00:13:49.933 --> 00:13:53.034
very experienced and devoted yogis, et cetera,

350
00:13:53.034 --> 00:13:57.802
can function a good part of the time in the delta state?

351
00:13:57.802 --> 00:13:59.075
<v ->They hang out there, in theta.</v>

352
00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:00.061
<v Regina>They hang out there.</v>

353
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:01.253
<v ->They hang out in theta/delta.</v>

354
00:14:01.253 --> 00:14:03.110
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>
They just hang there.

355
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.337
So if you've been in what we call the presence of a saint,

356
00:14:05.337 --> 00:14:08.236
and you feel some sort of a shifting,

357
00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:10.068
I mean literally, like an electrical current,

358
00:14:10.068 --> 00:14:12.140
brain wave states are electrical current,

359
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.142
and you are getting a different electrical current.

360
00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:16.298
It's like the difference between

361
00:14:16.298 --> 00:14:18.655
plugging into a 220 or a 110.

362
00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:20.872
You plug into a 220, you're in high beta.

363
00:14:20.872 --> 00:14:23.133
(imitates machine whining), you know,

364
00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:26.145
you plug into a 110, you've chilled out a little bit.

365
00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:29.399
You plug into a yogi, you're probably down to 30.

366
00:14:29.587 --> 00:14:32.450
(makes shushing noise)

367
00:14:32.758 --> 00:14:33.831
<v Regina>So what happens when we're</v>

368
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.134
plugging into each other in our culture all day long,

369
00:14:36.134 --> 00:14:37.949
especially in the caffeine culture?

370
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:39.512
<v ->In my opinion, the same.</v>

371
00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:42.086
To the degree that we have what

372
00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:44.947
the language Silva made popular, mind control,

373
00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:48.392
is the degree we can hold our mind where we want it,

374
00:14:48.392 --> 00:14:50.899
regardless of external influence,

375
00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:53.870
and that's hopefully what a meditator learns to do,

376
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.487
is to be able to control that.

377
00:14:55.487 --> 00:14:57.749
If I wanna put it right in this language,

378
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:59.452
the BAT language, it's to be able

379
00:14:59.452 --> 00:15:01.677
to control that electrical current through the brain.

380
00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:03.888
So that if I drive out of here, let's say,

381
00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:06.170
and a rabbit goes in front of my car,

382
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.104
and I'm afraid of hitting it, I go "AAAH!"

383
00:15:09.104 --> 00:15:10.598
I could freak, or I can just go,

384
00:15:10.598 --> 00:15:13.042
"I'm gonna stop for that pretty rabbit."

385
00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:16.224
One puts me in high beta, one keeps me in alpha.

386
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.139
<v Regina>What about the life we're living,</v>

387
00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:25.570
and the culture in which we live?

388
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.137
We're bombarded with thoughts, ideas,

389
00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.917
billboards, magazines, media, et cetera.

390
00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:35.161
How is that affecting the, quote,

391
00:15:35.161 --> 00:15:37.728
subliminal programming of our brain?

392
00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:38.774
In an overt way, even?

393
00:15:38.774 --> 00:15:41.325
<v ->It's a great question, and I'm the wrong one to ask.</v>

394
00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:43.757
I took my T.V. out about 28 years ago.

395
00:15:43.757 --> 00:15:45.239
I don't read the newspaper,

396
00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:47.709
I don't listen to the news, except NPR.

397
00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:49.907
I take selected magazines where I'm

398
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:53.787
very, very conscious of how I input information.

399
00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:56.857
<v Regina>You obviously have done this intentionally.</v>

400
00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:57.658
<v ->One would think so.</v>

401
00:15:57.658 --> 00:15:58.999
(laughter)

402
00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.402
It's become a habit, hasn't it?

403
00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:04.655
<v Regina>Well, I can completely relate to that.</v>

404
00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:08.260
I also had to stop reading the paper quite a long time ago.

405
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.912
I'll cruise the headlines, still,

406
00:16:09.912 --> 00:16:12.143
just to be aware of what's happening,

407
00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:15.258
but this degree of negativity,

408
00:16:16.798 --> 00:16:20.490
by design or not, is creating a huge amount

409
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.336
of neuroses in this culture, it would seem.

410
00:16:22.336 --> 00:16:24.839
And how are you experiencing

411
00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:27.763
the end result of that in your clientele?

412
00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:29.391
<v ->That's a good question.</v>

413
00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:32.523
I wanna say one segue into that, if I might first.

414
00:16:32.523 --> 00:16:36.278
I have a theory that the bombardment on the United States

415
00:16:36.278 --> 00:16:40.736
of the 9/11 photography put probably a good 60%

416
00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:43.300
of our public into post traumatic stress disorder,

417
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.269
none of which has been recognized,

418
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.052
and so people are walking around out there goin'

419
00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:48.717
"I dunno what's wrong with me."

420
00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.579
Well, if you sit and watch image after image after image

421
00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:54.670
after image after image, it just mainlines straight in.

422
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.521
Then you go to sleep at night and go into theta,

423
00:16:57.521 --> 00:16:59.665
and when all that downloads, it goes

424
00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:01.528
directly into long term memory.

425
00:17:01.528 --> 00:17:03.774
Now, we have another disaster that

426
00:17:03.774 --> 00:17:06.162
we're watching more and more and more images of.

427
00:17:06.162 --> 00:17:08.864
I think what that has done is really

428
00:17:10.914 --> 00:17:14.908
created a tremendous imbalance in our society.

429
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:16.581
Fear based, as you said earlier.

430
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:18.407
I'm finding people primarily fear based,

431
00:17:18.407 --> 00:17:21.025
I'm finding people scattered, I'm finding people

432
00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:23.697
unable to focus, all of the things that would be

433
00:17:23.697 --> 00:17:26.712
the side effects of a post-traumatic stress disorder.

434
00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.333
<v Regina>And of the,</v>

435
00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:30.816
what are we supposed to do en masse?

436
00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:33.225
What would you recommend if you were queen of the world,

437
00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:36.543
en masse, to start reversing

438
00:17:36.543 --> 00:17:39.565
some of the fear that's been instigated here?

439
00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:42.146
<v ->Well of course, I have a personal agenda.</v>

440
00:17:42.146 --> 00:17:42.902
<v Regina>Right.</v>

441
00:17:42.902 --> 00:17:44.599
<v ->I would run my CD Open To Love</v>

442
00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:46.988
on every Muzak and elevator in America.

443
00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:49.684
I have 90 statements on it dissolving fear,

444
00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:52.876
and then 90 statements being safe in a loving environment.

445
00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:57.176
Post-traumatic stress disorder is in the theta.

446
00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.713
It's in the subconscious, and if you're not

447
00:17:58.713 --> 00:18:00.873
working on that level, you're not healing it.

448
00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:03.273
<v Regina>And this obviously is going to influence</v>

449
00:18:03.273 --> 00:18:06.062
other aspects of your life, if you have this anxiety,

450
00:18:06.062 --> 00:18:07.849
subconscious anxiety going on?

451
00:18:07.849 --> 00:18:09.369
<v ->Your business, your relationships,</v>

452
00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:10.923
what you're doing with your kids,

453
00:18:11.943 --> 00:18:13.618
it's pervasive.

454
00:18:15.104 --> 00:18:16.879
<v Regina>So, wouldn't you say,</v>

455
00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:18.944
you pick up one of these CDs, and

456
00:18:18.944 --> 00:18:22.143
we start working on ourselves in this SuperSleep state?

457
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.209
<v ->Mm hmm.</v>

458
00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Regina>You're talking about a Pandora's Box of sorts.</v>

459
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.998
You're coming up against every program

460
00:18:28.998 --> 00:18:32.871
that the person has held true on a subconscious level.

461
00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:35.458
How does the subconscious affect that person

462
00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:38.023
when you open these doors, what starts happening?

463
00:18:38.023 --> 00:18:40.833
<v ->The program's not for wimps, let me start there.</v>

464
00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:45.531
You really have to be willing to take a look at yourself,

465
00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:48.428
and be willing to go through the process of those changes.

466
00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:51.020
People who come to me unexpected,

467
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.724
and I have a tremendous amount of people

468
00:18:52.724 --> 00:18:56.549
who just find me on the internet, just kind of,

469
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:59.468
never have tried anything like this before,

470
00:18:59.468 --> 00:19:03.048
and that's why you see, on my web page, I have like

471
00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:06.692
22 pages of "What can I expect when I listen to this?"

472
00:19:06.692 --> 00:19:08.860
This is what processing looks like, folks,

473
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.581
so if you have this or this or this come up,

474
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:12.130
it's all perfectly normal.

475
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.747
<v Regina>Give me a typical processing scenario.</v>

476
00:19:14.747 --> 00:19:18.286
<v ->Sure, I have a new client that has a fear of flying.</v>

477
00:19:18.286 --> 00:19:20.154
She happens to be in marketing, and

478
00:19:20.154 --> 00:19:22.635
she works with an international clientele.

479
00:19:22.635 --> 00:19:24.922
This has stopped her in her tracks in business.

480
00:19:24.922 --> 00:19:26.656
(makes crash noise) All in all, done.

481
00:19:26.656 --> 00:19:29.626
So before I do a custom tape for someone,

482
00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:31.328
I always ask they start on a CD.

483
00:19:31.328 --> 00:19:33.017
Number one, it's a lot cheaper for them.

484
00:19:33.428 --> 00:19:34.512
It's just, you know.

485
00:19:34.718 --> 00:19:36.742
And so we started her on Open To Love.

486
00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.858
I gave her a week, and then I checked back in with her.

487
00:19:38.858 --> 00:19:41.099
She said, "You know, I've had this strangest thing."

488
00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:43.362
She said, "I've just been so irritable with my boyfriend,

489
00:19:43.362 --> 00:19:46.039
"and one day I just, everything in my life went wrong.

490
00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:48.165
"And then two days later, it happened to him."

491
00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:49.890
And she said, "We wondered what's going on."

492
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.806
I said, "You're processing."

493
00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:53.729
She started having nightmares.

494
00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:56.550
It is all unusual to have a nightmare,

495
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.753
and it's a wonderful thing when it happens.

496
00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:02.741
Because a nightmare says, "I've just hit Pandora's box.

497
00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:05.501
"I've just opened Pandora's Box, I've just

498
00:20:05.501 --> 00:20:07.083
"let that monster out."

499
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.702
And when you've had a nightmare

500
00:20:08.702 --> 00:20:11.203
that has been triggered by this kind of work,

501
00:20:11.203 --> 00:20:13.237
you never have that issue again.

502
00:20:13.237 --> 00:20:17.894
Your nightmare is your guarantee that issue's gone.

503
00:20:18.597 --> 00:20:20.004
It's quite wonderful.

504
00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.442
<v Regina>So how often do people bail</v>

505
00:20:21.442 --> 00:20:23.143
when the nightmares begin, and say,

506
00:20:23.143 --> 00:20:25.492
"Ooh, I can't ride this out any further."

507
00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:26.454
What happens then?

508
00:20:26.454 --> 00:20:27.762
<v ->Oh, that's an excellent question.</v>

509
00:20:27.762 --> 00:20:29.737
I don't know if I'm just protected,

510
00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:31.320
or you know, angels are flying all over us.

511
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.771
Anybody can make up any theory they want to.

512
00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:37.406
Generally speaking, I'd say over 95% of the time,

513
00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:41.334
anyone that begins working with the CD will continue.

514
00:20:41.334 --> 00:20:42.848
Because from the time they've had

515
00:20:42.848 --> 00:20:44.066
that thing on three nights,

516
00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:46.621
the subconscious has already started to program.

517
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:49.928
And it says, "I don't care what you want, conscious,

518
00:20:49.928 --> 00:20:52.726
"I want fixed," and it will leave them to turn that on.

519
00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:54.586
I have people say to me,

520
00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.418
"I swore I would never listen to you,

521
00:20:56.418 --> 00:20:58.047
"and I was so tired of your voice,

522
00:20:58.047 --> 00:20:59.234
"and I was not going through that,"

523
00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:01.124
went right in that night and turned that CD on.

524
00:21:02.577 --> 00:21:05.342
So what I really try to support people in doing

525
00:21:05.342 --> 00:21:07.551
is make this your program, I mean,

526
00:21:07.551 --> 00:21:10.005
you've got a CD, but listen to it your way.

527
00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:11.994
If you wanna listen to it two nights and quit, quit.

528
00:21:11.994 --> 00:21:14.658
You wanna listen to it a year without stopping,

529
00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:16.523
as one of my clients, did, get this.

530
00:21:17.183 --> 00:21:19.305
She traveled internationally, wore a watch,

531
00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:21.761
kept one watch on her home time

532
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:23.133
and one on her international time

533
00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:25.940
so she never went 24 hours without her tape.

534
00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.570
That's a little compulsive, but

535
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.103
<v Regina>She get her results, though?</v>

536
00:21:29.103 --> 00:21:31.250
<v ->She got her results, it worked for her.</v>

537
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.458
Then we went and worked on the compulsion.

538
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.975
(laughter)

539
00:21:35.975 --> 00:21:38.047
You know that game, Regina, one flips up,

540
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:40.116
another one flips up, it's like jack in the box.

541
00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:41.703
This one's gone, look what was under it.

542
00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:43.397
This one's gone, look what was under it.

543
00:21:43.397 --> 00:21:45.647
(laughter)

544
00:21:45.647 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Regina>We have another person on our site,</v>

545
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.545
Rob Williams, who also works

546
00:21:50.163 --> 00:21:52.375
with kinesiology and the subconscious mind,

547
00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:54.843
and talks about some of the key blocks

548
00:21:54.843 --> 00:21:57.251
that occur for humanity at large.

549
00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:00.468
What is your understanding, from all your experience,

550
00:22:00.468 --> 00:22:02.366
of some of the key blocks?

551
00:22:02.366 --> 00:22:05.360
Do you notice things with human beings

552
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.910
that come up over and over?

553
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.751
What would those key blocks generally be?

554
00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:10.934
<v ->Actually, that's how I started making things</v>

555
00:22:10.934 --> 00:22:13.227
for the public, as I said, the first four years

556
00:22:13.227 --> 00:22:14.747
I just worked one on one, and I had this

557
00:22:14.747 --> 00:22:17.042
"I will never make a recording for another person,

558
00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:19.260
"they must take responsibility for their own lives."

559
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.424
Well, then I made a tape for myself

560
00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:22.740
and got over that kind of arrogance.

561
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.805
(laughter)

562
00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:26.808
I'm doing this for me, too.

563
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:28.547
It never stops.

564
00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:30.472
And then I started making them for the public,

565
00:22:30.472 --> 00:22:32.259
based on just those themes, you know,

566
00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:33.561
nobody got enough love as a kid,

567
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:36.537
nobody got enough approval, nobody got enough safety.

568
00:22:37.087 --> 00:22:39.365
If we wanna call Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,

569
00:22:39.365 --> 00:22:41.238
if you wanna start just with a

570
00:22:41.238 --> 00:22:43.178
hierarchy of needs, it's pretty interesting,

571
00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:45.607
or you can start with a chakra system, and just

572
00:22:45.607 --> 00:22:47.892
clear everything that's supposedly in those chakras.

573
00:22:47.892 --> 00:22:49.223
That's pretty interesting.

574
00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:53.386
You can go through any philosophical door you choose to,

575
00:22:54.146 --> 00:22:56.106
to reach what you think those issues are.

576
00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:59.453
For me, 20 years later, as you know what became great fun,

577
00:22:59.453 --> 00:23:01.618
is about five years ago I started working with

578
00:23:01.618 --> 00:23:03.717
what we would call collective unconscious,

579
00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:05.930
of if you choose to call it, karmic issues,

580
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.524
and did a couple of research projects on that.

581
00:23:08.524 --> 00:23:11.397
We got some major, major movement with people

582
00:23:11.397 --> 00:23:15.831
when we took on what we felt were universal, karmic issues.

583
00:23:16.101 --> 00:23:18.654
Slavery, domination, other things that have been

584
00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:21.368
going on on this planet from the beginning.

585
00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.962
We had some shake, rattle and roll on that.

586
00:23:25.197 --> 00:23:27.392
<v Regina>Does the karma extend to individuals,</v>

587
00:23:27.392 --> 00:23:31.158
as well, and even extending back into other times?

588
00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.229
<v ->I dunno, make up a story.</v>

589
00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.669
<v Regina>Yeah, so, wherever it's coming from,</v>

590
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:36.936
it doesn't matter if it's individual, or collective.

591
00:23:36.936 --> 00:23:39.264
The experience is still buried there,

592
00:23:39.264 --> 00:23:40.724
in the subconscious mind.

593
00:23:40.724 --> 00:23:42.510
<v ->If we choose to believe that delta is</v>

594
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.997
the access to the collective unconscious,

595
00:23:44.997 --> 00:23:47.196
then every one of us access that.

596
00:23:47.438 --> 00:23:50.853
If we go with that scientific doorway,

597
00:23:50.853 --> 00:23:53.786
and then every time every one of us goes into delta,

598
00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:55.387
we are going in that doorway.

599
00:23:57.057 --> 00:23:59.161
<v Regina>What about the notion of belief systems,</v>

600
00:23:59.161 --> 00:24:01.433
and religion, and how this plays in?

601
00:24:02.763 --> 00:24:04.757
Are there, do you find that some people

602
00:24:04.757 --> 00:24:07.695
are afraid of having their mind worked with,

603
00:24:07.695 --> 00:24:10.035
because of religious or spiritual

604
00:24:10.035 --> 00:24:11.908
belief systems that are in place?

605
00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:13.737
<v ->Yes, and again in the first years,</v>

606
00:24:13.737 --> 00:24:15.304
that's why it was so powerful for me

607
00:24:15.304 --> 00:24:16.624
to be working with people where they

608
00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:18.346
made their own recordings, so they got

609
00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:19.828
to do it in their own language.

610
00:24:20.238 --> 00:24:23.287
I will give you an example, I had a young woman come to me.

611
00:24:23.287 --> 00:24:24.642
Gorgeous young woman.

612
00:24:24.777 --> 00:24:28.113
She was bulimic, she was all dressed in flowing silk,

613
00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:30.061
everything was colorful and soft.

614
00:24:30.061 --> 00:24:32.251
And I said, "I'm just curious, what do you do?"

615
00:24:32.251 --> 00:24:34.152
She was a park ranger, she went out

616
00:24:34.152 --> 00:24:36.690
three months at a time, in a canoe in Alaska,

617
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.418
by herself, and mapped rivers.

618
00:24:39.112 --> 00:24:42.585
I kinda went, "Cognitive dissonance, cognitive dissonance,

619
00:24:42.585 --> 00:24:44.305
"cognitive dissonance."
<v Regina>It's a disguise.</v>

620
00:24:44.305 --> 00:24:45.910
(laughter)

621
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.445
<v ->Oops!</v>

622
00:24:46.445 --> 00:24:47.846
<v Regina>You wouldn't have read that one.</v>

623
00:24:47.876 --> 00:24:50.415
<v ->No, I woulda missed that one by, as we say,</v>

624
00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:53.949
the New York mile, and I'm goin' okay.

625
00:24:53.949 --> 00:24:56.468
She'd been in out of several treatments centers,

626
00:24:56.468 --> 00:24:58.192
the fancy one in Florida and whatever,

627
00:24:58.192 --> 00:24:59.677
and had not been able to fix this.

628
00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:01.075
They told her, "You go into one more

629
00:25:01.075 --> 00:25:02.778
"bout like this, chickie, you're dead."

630
00:25:02.778 --> 00:25:04.675
So that was pretty serious to her.

631
00:25:05.234 --> 00:25:06.558
<v Regina>She found her way to your door?</v>

632
00:25:07.158 --> 00:25:09.446
<v ->Different, it's interesting how they find me, isn't it?</v>

633
00:25:10.448 --> 00:25:11.813
<v Regina>So what happened, when she saw</v>

634
00:25:11.813 --> 00:25:13.394
this dissonance, as it were?

635
00:25:13.394 --> 00:25:14.854
<v ->I started playing with that dissonance,</v>

636
00:25:14.854 --> 00:25:17.945
and what I found was, she was raised Amish.

637
00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:21.530
She was extremely, we can call it creative,

638
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.691
we can call it sensual, we can call it kinesthetic,

639
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:26.123
whatever language is comfortable for you on it.

640
00:25:26.123 --> 00:25:29.554
But it gave her great pleasure to have

641
00:25:29.554 --> 00:25:32.441
all of the things in her life the Amish said were sins.

642
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:33.667
<v Regina>Mmmm.</v>

643
00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.549
<v ->Including the pleasant taste of food.</v>

644
00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:37.216
<v Regina>Mmmm.</v>

645
00:25:37.216 --> 00:25:40.152
<v ->And so we created a script for her that said</v>

646
00:25:40.152 --> 00:25:45.058
things like, God knows I'm a good person, or a good girl,

647
00:25:45.058 --> 00:25:47.998
or a good Amish person, or whatever her language was,

648
00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:50.809
when I nurture myself with good food.

649
00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:52.388
<v Regina>Mmm hmmm.</v>

650
00:25:52.388 --> 00:25:53.260
(finger snap)

651
00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:55.346
She could eat again.
<v ->That was it.</v>

652
00:25:55.346 --> 00:25:56.381
<v Regina>And carry the food.</v>

653
00:25:57.041 --> 00:25:58.373
<v ->So what I found, and I know you found</v>

654
00:25:58.373 --> 00:26:01.275
the same thing in hypnosis, is when we get these thoughts,

655
00:26:01.275 --> 00:26:04.039
some of them hook up like cars on a railroad train.

656
00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:06.015
(laughter)

657
00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:08.464
and as soon as those things hook up and connect,

658
00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:10.991
that's where we get some very interesting behavior.

659
00:26:11.168 --> 00:26:14.556
A lot of my work is to disconnect those,

660
00:26:14.556 --> 00:26:17.969
and that's why some of the scripting language I use

661
00:26:17.969 --> 00:26:20.204
can be something like this,

662
00:26:20.564 --> 00:26:24.343
"Eating well and feeling shame are separate for me now.

663
00:26:24.343 --> 00:26:26.388
"Eating gourmet food and feeling guilty

664
00:26:26.388 --> 00:26:27.917
"are separate for me now."

665
00:26:27.917 --> 00:26:29.919
See, we literally just unhook those.

666
00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.195
If you can find those statements,

667
00:26:32.195 --> 00:26:33.762
you're just three minutes, well actually,

668
00:26:33.762 --> 00:26:36.629
24 seconds away from being able to unhook them.

669
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:40.439
<v Regina>What happens, though, when you have,</v>

670
00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:42.264
say if you have a CD that's pre-recorded,

671
00:26:42.264 --> 00:26:43.988
now this is for an individual,

672
00:26:44.758 --> 00:26:46.233
if you have one that's pre-recorded

673
00:26:46.233 --> 00:26:49.679
taking into account the various different

674
00:26:50.619 --> 00:26:52.693
influences in one's life, they could be

675
00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:55.445
polar opposites but have the same effect,

676
00:26:57.205 --> 00:27:00.019
how is that bridged in the way you do things?

677
00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:02.107
<v ->Great, I love talking to hypnotherapists.</v>

678
00:27:02.107 --> 00:27:03.191
(laughter)

679
00:27:03.191 --> 00:27:05.787
Two things, number one is, I shared before in the scripting,

680
00:27:05.787 --> 00:27:07.611
let's go back to, let's say, eating,

681
00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:09.756
because this was the example we brought up.

682
00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:14.044
"I release and forgive myself for eating too much.

683
00:27:14.044 --> 00:27:17.232
"I release and forgive myself for not eating too much."

684
00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:20.072
I always, what I call, clear it both ways.

685
00:27:20.752 --> 00:27:21.827
<v Regina>And the subconscious mind,</v>

686
00:27:21.827 --> 00:27:23.413
it doesn't matter to it, it will take

687
00:27:23.413 --> 00:27:26.014
the one that it's attached to, so to speak?

688
00:27:26.684 --> 00:27:29.458
<v ->Every one of my CDs starts with a protection statement</v>

689
00:27:29.458 --> 00:27:32.414
that says, "As I listen to these statements,

690
00:27:32.414 --> 00:27:36.114
"I am divinely protected, I hear only the statements

691
00:27:36.114 --> 00:27:38.952
"for my highest good and perfect healing,

692
00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:40.959
"dissolving all else."

693
00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:42.257
Isn't that sweet?

694
00:27:42.257 --> 00:27:43.403
Any event, I do something.

695
00:27:43.403 --> 00:27:44.528
<v Regina>Pretty much covers that part.</v>

696
00:27:44.528 --> 00:27:47.692
<v ->Then I do something stupid, you don't hafta pay the price.</v>

697
00:27:47.737 --> 00:27:50.640
So, that gets it set up, and then,

698
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.462
once the subconscious hears this both ways,

699
00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:56.088
if one's already healed, it just doesn't need it.

700
00:27:56.088 --> 00:27:58.474
And if the other one's not, it takes it into account.

701
00:27:58.474 --> 00:27:59.464
<v Regina>Mmm hmm.</v>

702
00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:02.807
<v ->That's the first one, and then, when I get further,</v>

703
00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:04.702
deeper into what I call the clearing script,

704
00:28:04.702 --> 00:28:06.913
before I go into the positive affirmations,

705
00:28:06.913 --> 00:28:08.301
I have this marvelous statement

706
00:28:08.301 --> 00:28:10.759
that took me like 16 years to get,

707
00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:15.051
"I dissolve all my imbalances on the soul level around."

708
00:28:15.342 --> 00:28:16.724
It's pretty sweet, you can just do

709
00:28:16.724 --> 00:28:18.494
"I dissolve all my imbalances

710
00:28:18.494 --> 00:28:20.308
"on the soul level around food."

711
00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:21.523
<v Regina>Mmm hmm.</v>

712
00:28:21.523 --> 00:28:22.583
<v ->I don't have to know what they are.</v>

713
00:28:22.583 --> 00:28:23.297
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

714
00:28:23.297 --> 00:28:24.688
<v ->"I dissolve all my imbalances</v>

715
00:28:24.688 --> 00:28:26.084
"on the soul level around eating."

716
00:28:26.084 --> 00:28:27.654
I don't have to know what they are.

717
00:28:27.654 --> 00:28:30.194
After I used that statement for four years,

718
00:28:30.194 --> 00:28:32.965
and it's still on some of my CDs, I thought,

719
00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:36.341
am I limiting myself by saying "On the soul level?"

720
00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:39.661
If we choose to believe in an aetheric level,

721
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:41.960
or an astral level, or if we have other belief systems,

722
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.539
I have just limited this person.

723
00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.809
So all of the new work just says,

724
00:28:46.809 --> 00:28:49.823
"I dissolve all my imbalances around."

725
00:28:50.417 --> 00:28:51.117
<v Regina>Right.</v>

726
00:28:51.807 --> 00:28:54.846
And speaking of the subject of the soul,

727
00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:58.475
and human evolution, at this time,

728
00:28:58.475 --> 00:29:01.554
when all this fear is being generated,

729
00:29:01.554 --> 00:29:03.926
we also seem to be noticing that

730
00:29:03.926 --> 00:29:06.489
many, many people on this planet are,

731
00:29:06.489 --> 00:29:08.810
there's a push from inside their being

732
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.621
to start growing new parts,

733
00:29:11.621 --> 00:29:14.978
and evolving their own consciousness.

734
00:29:15.822 --> 00:29:18.218
How is what you're doing playing into

735
00:29:18.218 --> 00:29:21.262
the evolution of consciousness at this time,

736
00:29:21.262 --> 00:29:22.374
or is that something that you're

737
00:29:22.374 --> 00:29:24.261
exploring and working on now?

738
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:27.147
<v ->Well, I'm just gonna jump out there,</v>

739
00:29:27.147 --> 00:29:29.872
I appreciate your style, because you're putting me on a line

740
00:29:29.872 --> 00:29:32.081
that I have not gone on before publicly.

741
00:29:32.081 --> 00:29:33.747
When I started this many years ago,

742
00:29:33.747 --> 00:29:35.664
I set a quote secret purpose that

743
00:29:35.664 --> 00:29:36.974
I did not share with anyone, and it was

744
00:29:36.974 --> 00:29:39.539
to change the collective unconscious on the planet.

745
00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:42.540
If we choose to believe in the Hundredth Monkey,

746
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.842
if we choose to believe in some of those philosophies,

747
00:29:44.842 --> 00:29:48.237
if 144,000 people shift in a particular way,

748
00:29:48.237 --> 00:29:50.220
supposedly, it's enough to hold the energy

749
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.717
for the rest of the people to shift.

750
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.063
I'm perfectly happy to support that.

751
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.981
<v Regina>And so, what you're already doing</v>

752
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:58.793
is spinning that into motion?

753
00:29:58.793 --> 00:29:59.545
<v ->You got it.</v>

754
00:29:59.545 --> 00:30:00.917
<v Regina>And how about someone who's</v>

755
00:30:00.917 --> 00:30:04.824
not coming for relationships, or health, or anything else,

756
00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:07.977
they say "I seem to be experiencing some block

757
00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:11.558
"in my own being, I want to jump to the next level."

758
00:30:11.558 --> 00:30:13.578
Maybe most people, not even knowing

759
00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:17.590
what that next level is, how do you then respond to that?

760
00:30:17.844 --> 00:30:19.510
<v ->Actually, if we know what the next level is,</v>

761
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.164
I get a little nervous, because,

762
00:30:21.164 --> 00:30:23.327
(laughter)

763
00:30:23.327 --> 00:30:24.888
that tells me we probably don't have a clue

764
00:30:24.888 --> 00:30:26.819
where we're going, but I haven't, anyway.

765
00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:27.956
Let me speak for myself,

766
00:30:27.956 --> 00:30:29.348
I shouldn't put that on anyone else.

767
00:30:29.688 --> 00:30:31.522
I would chat with the person a few minutes,

768
00:30:31.522 --> 00:30:34.496
I could certainly start them with Ground your Spirituality.

769
00:30:34.496 --> 00:30:37.196
I love that CD, I'll give you an example.

770
00:30:37.196 --> 00:30:38.600
When I moved to Sedona, I thought,

771
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.069
okay, now it's my turn, I've been in the business world

772
00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:42.229
and I've worked for the governor,

773
00:30:42.229 --> 00:30:43.064
and I've done all that stuff.

774
00:30:43.064 --> 00:30:45.192
Now, I'm gonna become Mother Teresa.

775
00:30:45.192 --> 00:30:47.615
And you know, I wore sackcloth, and took off my earrings,

776
00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:48.844
and quit cussing, and you know.

777
00:30:48.844 --> 00:30:49.661
<v Regina>Which a lot of people in Sedona</v>

778
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.964
do when they first arrive.

779
00:30:50.964 --> 00:30:52.773
<v ->It was the natural go Sedona thing.</v>

780
00:30:52.773 --> 00:30:55.400
I was out on the land every day going "Um,"

781
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.645
it was just great.

782
00:30:56.645 --> 00:30:58.984
I knew that I was just so close,

783
00:30:58.984 --> 00:31:00.668
so I did this script for myself,

784
00:31:00.668 --> 00:31:02.843
on grounding my spirituality,

785
00:31:02.843 --> 00:31:04.568
and one of the statements in there was,

786
00:31:04.568 --> 00:31:06.896
"I am divinely guided when to control

787
00:31:06.896 --> 00:31:10.363
"from personality and ego, and when to flow from soul."

788
00:31:10.682 --> 00:31:12.487
Because after I went into Boynton Canyon

789
00:31:12.487 --> 00:31:14.199
and sat there and opened my crown chakra,

790
00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:15.642
I still had to drive home.

791
00:31:15.642 --> 00:31:16.876
<v Regina>(laughs) Right.</v>

792
00:31:16.876 --> 00:31:19.360
<v ->So I'm goin', okay, I kinda need to work this out.</v>

793
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.820
That was the statement--

794
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.726
<v Regina>So what happened from there, for you?</v>

795
00:31:22.726 --> 00:31:24.674
<v ->I was so excited, because I knew it was gonna</v>

796
00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.743
put me over the edge, I was gonna be so spiritual.

797
00:31:26.743 --> 00:31:28.500
And three days later, I come out, put my earrings back on,

798
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.849
put my mascara back on, change back into my,

799
00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:32.534
and start cussing again, and I wondered,

800
00:31:32.534 --> 00:31:34.133
what has happened here?

801
00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:35.846
(Regina laughs)
What just happened here?

802
00:31:36.116 --> 00:31:39.087
This is not what I expected to happen.

803
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:41.438
So I called some of my gurus or whatever,

804
00:31:41.438 --> 00:31:42.891
and I said, "What just happened here?"

805
00:31:42.891 --> 00:31:46.583
and they said "Teri, we have a Mother Teresa.

806
00:31:46.583 --> 00:31:48.049
"We don't have another person training

807
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:50.372
for the Department of Defense doing what you're doing."

808
00:31:52.012 --> 00:31:54.350
<v Regina>Therein lies your secret,</v>

809
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:58.087
to be able to do this work in the real world.

810
00:31:58.087 --> 00:31:59.593
<v ->In interesting places.</v>

811
00:31:59.593 --> 00:32:00.655
(laughter)

812
00:32:00.655 --> 00:32:02.846
In interesting places, yes.

813
00:32:05.546 --> 00:32:08.110
<v Regina>Do you find that in that real world,</v>

814
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.713
where we're talking about some

815
00:32:10.423 --> 00:32:13.246
agencies that have a lot of different things going,

816
00:32:14.356 --> 00:32:17.739
that it's, especially when we start kinda

817
00:32:17.739 --> 00:32:20.336
stereotyping industries, for example.

818
00:32:21.146 --> 00:32:24.210
Do you find it's really not the same

819
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.970
when you get to an individual level,

820
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.704
as the people's, as someone's understanding

821
00:32:28.704 --> 00:32:32.940
of some of these kind of overarching motives or agendas?

822
00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:34.374
<v ->Unfortunately, I would have said that.</v>

823
00:32:34.374 --> 00:32:35.878
Before I went into politics,

824
00:32:35.878 --> 00:32:38.352
I was a gubernatorial appointee at one time,

825
00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:39.982
going from division to division,

826
00:32:39.982 --> 00:32:43.331
and I found most of the people I encountered

827
00:32:43.331 --> 00:32:44.918
in the political realm, unfortunately,

828
00:32:44.918 --> 00:32:46.448
to be worse than I expected them to be.

829
00:32:46.448 --> 00:32:47.331
<v Regina>Oh goodness.</v>

830
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.501
<v ->So that was quite a shock for me.</v>

831
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:49.467
<v Regina>That's a surprise.</v>

832
00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.858
<v ->But remember, I hadn't been watching T.V.,</v>

833
00:32:50.858 --> 00:32:52.221
and I hadn't been reading the paper,

834
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:54.043
so what did I know? (laughs)

835
00:32:54.043 --> 00:32:55.394
<v Regina>Gee, I was kinda thinking</v>

836
00:32:55.394 --> 00:32:56.709
maybe it would be the other way.

837
00:32:56.709 --> 00:32:58.781
<v ->I'd love to have given you a positive here.</v>

838
00:32:58.781 --> 00:33:01.429
So I came outta that one a little bit shell shocked.

839
00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:03.707
I came outta that one a little bit shell shocked.

840
00:33:03.707 --> 00:33:05.230
<v Regina>But you worked on somea your co-workers.</v>

841
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.670
<v ->Absolutely, and we did a fabulous job.</v>

842
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.499
And what I found was, as is true anywhere,

843
00:33:10.499 --> 00:33:12.100
it's just percentages.

844
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.868
If we choose to believe in the Pareto Principle

845
00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:15.927
of the 80/20 rule, all the research on that,

846
00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:19.932
in one industry, you probably have 20% self-seekers

847
00:33:19.932 --> 00:33:22.767
and 80% who are really working for a higher good,

848
00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.350
and perhaps in another industry,

849
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.539
its 20/80 goes the other way.

850
00:33:27.449 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Regina>Well, now you're in the 80/20, it sounds like.</v>

851
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.095
<v ->Let's hope so.</v>

852
00:33:31.095 --> 00:33:32.812
(laughter)

853
00:33:32.812 --> 00:33:35.602
I'm pretty blessed, I meet some pretty fun people.

854
00:33:35.602 --> 00:33:38.202
Even what we would call traditional people,

855
00:33:38.202 --> 00:33:40.992
and again, as you can tell, I can move my language

856
00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:43.715
to meet the person where they are.

857
00:33:43.715 --> 00:33:48.014
I have zero desire to change a person's belief system.

858
00:33:48.014 --> 00:33:50.062
If they come in with a belief system,

859
00:33:50.062 --> 00:33:52.060
we work with that belief system

860
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.000
to get them the results they want.

861
00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:57.462
<v Regina>If you could instill just one thought,</v>

862
00:33:57.462 --> 00:33:59.940
and not even instill, but maybe just share with us,

863
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.032
one thought that seems to move to the heart

864
00:34:03.032 --> 00:34:05.155
of what most people are looking for.

865
00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:07.260
<v ->Oh sure, peace, inner peace.</v>

866
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.621
I ended up doing a CD after 20 years

867
00:34:10.621 --> 00:34:12.326
called Attain Inner Peace.

868
00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:14.855
The way that started is I made the commitment

869
00:34:14.855 --> 00:34:17.197
to do a 12-step series, one for

870
00:34:17.197 --> 00:34:19.345
each of the steps of the AA program.

871
00:34:19.345 --> 00:34:21.244
And the more I got into that, and I studied it,

872
00:34:21.244 --> 00:34:23.050
met with the coordinators, all that stuff,

873
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.860
I'm a researcher, and

874
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.825
my ego gets involved, you'd think after all these years

875
00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:30.466
I wouldn't have ego attachment, but,

876
00:34:30.466 --> 00:34:32.553
give that over, I have ego attachment.

877
00:34:32.553 --> 00:34:35.322
And I just kept saying, this isn't gonna take 12 recordings.

878
00:34:35.322 --> 00:34:36.752
I can do this in one recording.

879
00:34:36.752 --> 00:34:38.036
And everybody kept saying, no you can't.

880
00:34:38.036 --> 00:34:39.606
And I kept saying, "Yes, I can."

881
00:34:39.606 --> 00:34:41.553
So I just kept focusing on that,

882
00:34:41.553 --> 00:34:43.491
and I thank Steven Halpern for this,

883
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:45.853
he and I were working on some music,

884
00:34:45.853 --> 00:34:46.915
and this was a line in one of--

885
00:34:46.915 --> 00:34:47.805
<v Regina>Oh, perfect.</v>

886
00:34:47.805 --> 00:34:49.731
<v ->This was a line in one of his brochures,</v>

887
00:34:50.261 --> 00:34:52.751
and I just jumped it into the script, which is

888
00:34:52.751 --> 00:34:56.202
"I dissolve all my imbalances on the soul level

889
00:34:56.202 --> 00:35:00.350
"around seeking inner peace in dysfunctional ways."

890
00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:03.992
Now, that hits it all.

891
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.546
That's alcohol, that's all addictions,

892
00:35:06.546 --> 00:35:09.311
that's working too much, that's, you know,

893
00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:12.397
the constant gardener, it's staying in the garden too much.

894
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.120
That hits it.

895
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.094
I said, I like that.

896
00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:21.612
<v ->If you haven't already seen Rob Williams,</v>

897
00:35:21.612 --> 00:35:22.792
you might want to check it out,

898
00:35:22.792 --> 00:35:24.775
as it adds another piece to the subject

899
00:35:24.775 --> 00:35:27.693
of programming our subconscious for higher functioning.

900
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.633
Until next time, thanks for watching.

901
00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:35.306
(soulful music)
