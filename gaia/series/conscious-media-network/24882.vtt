2
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.616
<v ->While meeting with biographer Sidney Kirkpatrick</v>

3
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.029
at the Cayce headquarters in Virginia Beach,

4
00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.930
we learned of another book he recently wrote

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.281
titled Hitler's Holy Relics.

6
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.127
This was an aspect of World War II

7
00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.561
that I had never been exposed to, and reads like

8
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.791
an Indiana Jones adventure tale.

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.394
It's not fiction however.

10
00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:34.304
Sidney explains in detail the obsessive mission

11
00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:38.258
of Adolf Hitler to obtain the famed Spear of Destiny

12
00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:39.562
which is thought to be the spear

13
00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.312
that was driven into the side of Jesus

14
00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.121
during the crucifixion.

15
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.366
Also called the Spear of Longinus,

16
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.586
it has held a spellbinding power over military leaders

17
00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:51.670
throughout the ages.

18
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.009
So many people are intrigued with this

19
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.646
individual in modern history that seems to show

20
00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.995
many complex sides, the most of which

21
00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.431
he is certainly not respected for.

22
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.915
Nonetheless, there was something in Hitler

23
00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:11.729
that was obsessed with these holy relics.

24
00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.061
And you wrote a beautiful book on it,

25
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.298
and I thought we would first start out

26
00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:19.272
by asking you why you chose this subject of all subjects.

27
00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:23.477
Hitler's holy relics.

28
00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:28.242
<v ->I was very interested in a particular relic.</v>

29
00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:31.878
It's called the Spear of Longinus, or the Spear of Destiny.

30
00:01:31.878 --> 00:01:35.842
It was the spearhead or lance

31
00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:37.362
that was alleged to have been used

32
00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:41.425
at the crucifixion, spear in the side of Christ.

33
00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:45.762
And it has a long and detailed,

34
00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:47.448
wonderful history

35
00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:49.742
as it's passed on from,

36
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.994
you know, one ruler to the next, to the next.

37
00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:57.387
I was particularly interested in this relic

38
00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:01.425
in the larger scheme of things,

39
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:04.942
how it was venerated differently at different periods

40
00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:07.953
in time, and you could sort of get a sense of

41
00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:10.509
how Christianity changed and evolved

42
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.341
because at one time, the Spear of Longinus

43
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:17.810
was as sacred as the Holy Grail.

44
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.896
And of course, the Holy Grail at various points

45
00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:24.376
eclipsed the Spear of Longinus.

46
00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:27.018
Anyway, I was very interested in writing

47
00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:31.598
the history of this spear, only to discover

48
00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:35.366
that it's got a magnificent, marvelous,

49
00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.824
mind-boggling, actually, modern history

50
00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:42.481
that Adolf Hitler had become obsessed

51
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.286
with this relic as part of the collection

52
00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:47.775
of Holy Roman Empire relics.

53
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:53.383
And that not only Hitler was interested in it, and got it,

54
00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:56.115
but General Patton was also interested in it.

55
00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.264
So you have an interesting--

56
00:02:57.264 --> 00:02:58.763
<v Voiceover>Yeah, when you look at their personalities,</v>

57
00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:00.117
that would make sense.

58
00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:04.470
<v ->Well, it's just an interesting true historical drama</v>

59
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.917
which speaks to a much greater, longer story.

60
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Voiceover>You know, I don't know that this is</v>

61
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.128
the point at which I should be asking this

62
00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:16.293
or if you have any thoughts on it,

63
00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:20.301
but Patton with his connection

64
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:24.004
to the ancient Cathars I believe it was,

65
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:27.035
and with Hitler and this story that you're going to

66
00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:30.708
reveal here, did either of these men have a belief

67
00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:34.052
in past lives that they personally

68
00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.111
may have related to?

69
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.107
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

70
00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:42.601
And that's what makes this pair so interesting

71
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:45.026
because they were looking at it from different sides.

72
00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:49.839
The legends that grew up about this spear

73
00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.428
come almost as a talisman.

74
00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:56.790
I mean, there's a legend that goes with it

75
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.544
that you can trace, you know, right up through history

76
00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:02.295
that whoever holds this spear

77
00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:04.347
holds the destiny of mankind.

78
00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.298
The Longinus legend is actually suggested

79
00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:13.590
in the Bible, but Eastern Orthodox tradition

80
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.752
tells a much richer story.

81
00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:19.764
According to Christian tradition,

82
00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:24.133
Longinus was a legionnaire,

83
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:27.345
very well respected,

84
00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:30.291
Pilate appreciated his services,

85
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:32.875
he was very good in battle, he got cataracts

86
00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:35.926
or had difficulty with his vision

87
00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:37.402
and was no longer

88
00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:41.244
good on the battlefield, he was no longer good

89
00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:45.663
in service, so he was reassigned to Mount Calvary

90
00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:48.976
where, you know the crucifixion took place.

91
00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:51.522
And it was sort of easy duty.

92
00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:54.790
And when he came up, you know,

93
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.929
as legend has it, there were three

94
00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.886
souls being crucified, you have Jesus, and you have

95
00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:04.804
two thieves, and the thieves legs were broken.

96
00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.281
When Longinus came to Jesus, he speared him

97
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:11.536
in his right side, and according to tradition,

98
00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:13.763
ancient tradition, blood dripped down

99
00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:17.839
the side of the spear, and into Longinus's eyes,

100
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.167
and he was miraculously cured of cataracts.

101
00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:25.547
His eyesight returned, and he had a vision

102
00:05:25.547 --> 00:05:28.006
of Jesus as the Messiah,

103
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:30.913
and of the future.

104
00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:35.898
And future Christianity, and one could argue

105
00:05:37.748 --> 00:05:39.418
as I think Patton did.

106
00:05:39.418 --> 00:05:42.291
You know, Patton actually wrote on Longinus,

107
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:45.809
wrote a poem about Longinus.

108
00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.881
One could argue that the first Christian

109
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:51.931
was a Roman centurion

110
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:56.016
because Jesus didn't become the Messiah

111
00:05:56.016 --> 00:05:59.569
until the crucifixion, until he crossed.

112
00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.397
And Longinus was right there, and so one could argue

113
00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:06.667
that he was the first Christian,

114
00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:11.078
and began Christianity because after, you know,

115
00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:13.727
according to this tradition,

116
00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:16.512
Longinus could no longer serve Pilate

117
00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:21.117
and no longer serve Rome, and he left

118
00:06:21.117 --> 00:06:25.033
Jerusalem with his spear, carrying his spear.

119
00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:29.111
And because he was a Roman citizen and not a Jew,

120
00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:31.358
he was free to travel Roman roads.

121
00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:34.940
And so, he takes the spear with him and he walks

122
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.448
to Antioch, eventually gets to Rome.

123
00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:40.619
And you know, much of his movements,

124
00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.289
of course, are all legendary, so one can't say for certain.

125
00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.603
But, you know, according to tradition,

126
00:06:48.603 --> 00:06:52.743
he went around proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah

127
00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:55.690
and, you know, in his very act

128
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.898
he fulfilled certain Old Testament

129
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.105
prophesy.

130
00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:04.878
<v Voiceover>And can you talk about that prophesy,</v>

131
00:07:04.878 --> 00:07:06.221
that's my next question.

132
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:07.890
What was that prophesy?

133
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.690
<v ->Well, that the bones of Jesus would not be broken</v>

134
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.309
or that he would,

135
00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:19.130
and that a gentile would declare in the Messiah.

136
00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:23.673
<v Voiceover>Okay, so that had been fulfilled then.</v>

137
00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:26.653
<v ->By Longinus's act.</v>

138
00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:31.567
And so, this spear was passed on.

139
00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:35.193
It was first, you know, Longinus first had it,

140
00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:39.424
and then it was passed on through legend

141
00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:43.443
in Cappadocia, eventually becoming

142
00:07:43.443 --> 00:07:47.204
the property of the Theban Legion in Egypt.

143
00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:50.233
And the Theban Legion was really the first

144
00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:53.784
Christian legion, Coptic Christian legion,

145
00:07:53.784 --> 00:07:56.348
and they were sent off to Gaul

146
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.153
by the Roman emperor.

147
00:08:00.153 --> 00:08:04.658
And in Gaul, they were to fight

148
00:08:05.762 --> 00:08:10.442
whom they discovered to be another Christian tribe.

149
00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:14.275
And they weren't about to kill fellow Christians

150
00:08:14.275 --> 00:08:19.212
and martyred themselves

151
00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:22.736
rather than kill further Christians.

152
00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:23.944
The whole

153
00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:29.300
hymn Onward, Christian Soldiers

154
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.026
comes out of that.

155
00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:35.220
This spear became sort of a holy talisman,

156
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.590
and it was passed from, you know,

157
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.443
one army ruler to the next.

158
00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:43.175
It was not property of the church,

159
00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:44.741
never became property of the church,

160
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:48.177
but Constantine was said to have carried it

161
00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:51.711
at the Two Councils of Nicaea.

162
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:53.090
You know, the second council being

163
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.625
where the actual Bible as we know it today

164
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:58.085
was assembled.

165
00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:03.774
Frederick Barbarossa passed on through

166
00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:05.757
the Holy Roman emperors.

167
00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:10.494
And it was widely believed, that it was actually used

168
00:09:10.494 --> 00:09:14.823
in the coronation ceremony to become

169
00:09:14.823 --> 00:09:17.501
a Holy Roman Emperor.

170
00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:21.128
One needed certain accouterments, and one needed

171
00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:22.723
the Spear of Destiny,

172
00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:27.025
a crown eventually,

173
00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:30.632
and paraphernalia was collected and passed on.

174
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.817
When Napoleon was, you know, rampaging

175
00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:38.635
through Europe, Napoleon wanted the spear,

176
00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:42.184
and he wanted the collection of Holy Roman relics

177
00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:46.062
because he was, he wanted to be the world monarch

178
00:09:46.062 --> 00:09:49.841
and he needed those signs, those symbols

179
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:52.127
of world domination that, you know,

180
00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:56.062
in order to be truly, call himself the world monarch,

181
00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:57.727
he needed these symbols with it.

182
00:10:00.106 --> 00:10:02.280
They were hidden from him.

183
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.087
They were secreted out of Germany

184
00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:05.742
and they were sent to Vienna.

185
00:10:07.387 --> 00:10:09.187
Jump ahead.

186
00:10:09.187 --> 00:10:12.664
Young Adolf Hitler, young failed art student

187
00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:14.009
in Austria.

188
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.504
As legend has it, he wanted to get out of the rain.

189
00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:25.419
People don't realize how impoverished Adolf was

190
00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:28.391
at various points in his early life.

191
00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:32.063
As the story is told as a failed art student,

192
00:10:32.063 --> 00:10:34.639
he was living at times on park benches.

193
00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:41.758
He came in to the royal treasury, the Hofburg

194
00:10:41.758 --> 00:10:43.688
in Austria, in Vienna

195
00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:47.186
to get out of the rain, supposedly walking

196
00:10:47.186 --> 00:10:50.599
through the halls, and he saw

197
00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:53.265
the crown jewels on display.

198
00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:56.556
And allegedly,

199
00:10:58.598 --> 00:11:02.184
he had an epiphany, a moment in which

200
00:11:05.006 --> 00:11:07.234
he saw the future of the world,

201
00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:10.913
and he saw, looking at this spear.

202
00:11:12.085 --> 00:11:14.548
And years later,

203
00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:17.769
as he rose in office,

204
00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:22.760
he tried to arrange for a loan

205
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:27.118
of the crown jewels to Germany.

206
00:11:27.118 --> 00:11:30.706
And the Austrian government would not

207
00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:34.241
permit a loan

208
00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:36.020
because they knew the Germans weren't gonna

209
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.017
give them back.

210
00:11:38.017 --> 00:11:42.005
So, at the opening of World War II

211
00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:46.170
when actually the invasion of Austria,

212
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.945
the very first art and artifacts

213
00:11:49.945 --> 00:11:51.797
that the Nazis seized

214
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.909
was the Spear of Longinus and the crown jewels

215
00:11:55.909 --> 00:11:57.374
of the Holy Roman emperor.

216
00:11:57.374 --> 00:11:58.419
<v Voiceover>So he was on a mission.</v>

217
00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:00.564
Let's go back for just a moment to that epiphany

218
00:12:00.564 --> 00:12:03.277
when he was walking through the Habsburg palace

219
00:12:03.277 --> 00:12:05.523
and first became exposed to this.

220
00:12:06.763 --> 00:12:08.620
And I'd ask you about the reincarnation piece

221
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.998
a little bit ago.

222
00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:12.052
Did his epiphany have anything to do with himself,

223
00:12:12.052 --> 00:12:14.087
did he see himself in this broader picture

224
00:12:14.087 --> 00:12:16.019
somewhere somehow?

225
00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.505
<v ->Well, I'm sure you could read that into it.</v>

226
00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:19.912
But there no hard evidence,

227
00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:22.140
no hard documentation.

228
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.151
But even in Mein Kampf,

229
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.899
he references that moment

230
00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:31.724
seeing those artifacts

231
00:12:31.724 --> 00:12:35.152
and how important it was to him and to the future.

232
00:12:35.152 --> 00:12:37.570
So, one could easily interpret

233
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.572
more meaning in that, and it depends on,

234
00:12:41.572 --> 00:12:43.799
you know, what tradition you're coming out of,

235
00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:44.723
how you're looking at it.

236
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:45.786
<v Voiceover>Well true, he who holds the spear</v>

237
00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:48.444
holds the destiny of mankind.

238
00:12:48.444 --> 00:12:51.277
Okay, so he was highly motivated in this sense,

239
00:12:51.277 --> 00:12:54.725
on some psychological slash spiritual level.

240
00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:55.873
<v ->Yeah.</v>

241
00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:57.755
<v Voiceover>Okay, so now we go to modern history,</v>

242
00:12:57.755 --> 00:13:00.926
and let's talk about the journey from there

243
00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:01.794
and what happened

244
00:13:01.794 --> 00:13:05.449
when he made that his highest priority to gain access

245
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:08.012
to these, well, confiscate them, steal them, basically.

246
00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:11.793
<v ->Well, they were taken from Austria,</v>

247
00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:14.600
and they were put on display in Nuremberg

248
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.928
at a church in Nuremberg,

249
00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:19.841
and many thousands,

250
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.980
during the festivals,

251
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.109
many thousands of people came

252
00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:29.900
and saw the artifacts.

253
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.780
Eventually as the World War began

254
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.225
and bombing missions started,

255
00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:40.293
a special hidden vault was made for them.

256
00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:41.944
And they dropped from sight.

257
00:13:41.944 --> 00:13:43.706
And where they were really placed

258
00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:47.643
was literally underneath the castle.

259
00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:48.482
<v Voiceover>In Nuremberg?</v>

260
00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:51.513
<v ->In Nuremberg, in a special hidden chamber.</v>

261
00:13:51.513 --> 00:13:55.027
And a very high-tech chamber actually.

262
00:13:55.027 --> 00:13:57.918
You know, great expense was taken

263
00:13:57.918 --> 00:14:02.563
to construct this vault for these artifacts

264
00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:06.202
because Hitler wanted them preserved.

265
00:14:06.202 --> 00:14:09.020
This was Germany's--

266
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.461
<v Voiceover>It was to be his legacy after this, right?</v>

267
00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:15.069
<v ->I mean, he viewed, you know,</v>

268
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:16.618
the thousand year reich.

269
00:14:16.618 --> 00:14:20.342
And these were artifacts that were

270
00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:22.769
that were the thousand,

271
00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:25.576
symbols of the thousand year reich.

272
00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:27.207
<v Voiceover>And so, where did</v>

273
00:14:27.207 --> 00:14:30.414
Lieutenant Walter Horn come in to all of this?

274
00:14:30.414 --> 00:14:32.761
Where does that part of the story come in?

275
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:35.598
Just, maybe you can give us a linear reach

276
00:14:35.598 --> 00:14:36.839
from where you just were

277
00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.412
that he had them on display, and also had

278
00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:41.966
created this vault for their safekeeping in Nuremberg.

279
00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:46.274
And, then the plot starts thickening as time goes on,

280
00:14:46.274 --> 00:14:48.288
as everybody else, and Patton included,

281
00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.614
are after the same thing.

282
00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:51.192
So, just continue.

283
00:14:51.192 --> 00:14:54.489
<v ->Well, it was a research odyssey on my part.</v>

284
00:14:54.489 --> 00:14:59.156
I was very interested in, I knew

285
00:15:00.421 --> 00:15:03.690
ahead of time that Patton, you know,

286
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.478
under General Eisenhower had managed to

287
00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:10.517
reclaim these artifacts, and the spear in particular,

288
00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:12.427
but I didn't know how and I didn't know

289
00:15:12.427 --> 00:15:14.241
who had obtained them.

290
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:18.283
And I went in search, you know, first in

291
00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:21.071
College Park, Maryland, in the National Archives

292
00:15:21.071 --> 00:15:22.565
where all our military records were.

293
00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:24.484
And I went searching and searching,

294
00:15:24.484 --> 00:15:28.065
and I came up with a identification number

295
00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:30.068
of a particular soldier,

296
00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:33.463
and it was even more difficult to figure out

297
00:15:33.463 --> 00:15:34.701
who that soldier was.

298
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:39.261
But eventually, I was able to document a soldier.

299
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:42.839
And one, I think it surprised me

300
00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:49.809
that if, under Patton's command,

301
00:15:49.809 --> 00:15:53.152
a team had been sent in to recover

302
00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.135
these artifacts, why so little was known,

303
00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:57.865
and why so little was published.

304
00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:03.312
There's newsreel footage of the artifacts

305
00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:07.395
being returned to Austria, amongst great fanfare.

306
00:16:07.395 --> 00:16:11.407
Special trains, special plane was brought in.

307
00:16:13.478 --> 00:16:14.280
But who was the team?

308
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.161
How did they actually get it back?

309
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:17.188
<v Voiceover>So that story--</v>

310
00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:19.033
<v ->I was dying to find out,</v>

311
00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:22.337
which is how I came upon Walter Horn.

312
00:16:23.444 --> 00:16:26.721
And, Walter Horn, you know,

313
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:30.564
what a fascinating story, what a fascinating life odyssey.

314
00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:32.429
It's one of those things where

315
00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:36.970
there truth is really much stranger than fiction.

316
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.761
But Walter Horn had been a young art historian,

317
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:45.167
a young art student getting his doctorate.

318
00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:51.301
He got his doctorate just as Hitler came to power

319
00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:53.058
in 1933.

320
00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:55.128
<v Voiceover>He was getting his doctorate in--</v>

321
00:16:55.128 --> 00:16:57.939
<v ->In Heidelberg in Berlin.</v>

322
00:16:57.939 --> 00:17:02.787
And his specialty was Holy Roman Empire.

323
00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:07.725
And his specialty, these artifacts and the art

324
00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:09.790
of that era.

325
00:17:11.982 --> 00:17:13.792
And he was quite concerned, he was quite concerned

326
00:17:13.792 --> 00:17:17.065
about the Nazis, he was concerned about his future.

327
00:17:17.065 --> 00:17:21.542
His doctoral professor, Erwin Panofsky,

328
00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:23.408
he was a very famous art historian,

329
00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:25.619
eventually emigrated to the United States,

330
00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:26.990
was telling his students, you know,

331
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.544
get the hell out of Germany.

332
00:17:29.813 --> 00:17:34.014
You know, the horror is about to descend.

333
00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:39.367
Walter had very mixed feelings.

334
00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:43.011
A, he didn't think he was gonna get a job

335
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:44.641
outside of Germany

336
00:17:46.219 --> 00:17:48.800
in his particular specialty.

337
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.080
And B, he was having an affair

338
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.863
with a young Jewish woman

339
00:17:54.863 --> 00:17:58.239
who at the time happened to be married to a Nazi.

340
00:17:58.239 --> 00:18:01.027
And she thought by virtue of her marriage,

341
00:18:01.027 --> 00:18:02.277
she was gonna be protected.

342
00:18:02.277 --> 00:18:06.826
So, as much as Walter wanted to leave,

343
00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:10.192
and hated the Nazis.

344
00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:11.252
<v Voiceover>He didn't wanna leave her.</v>

345
00:18:11.252 --> 00:18:13.342
<v ->He was dragging his feet.</v>

346
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.971
And one thing led to another, and eventually

347
00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:19.839
he escaped to Italy, and from Italy,

348
00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:23.700
the SS started chasing him, and he got out of Italy

349
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.368
to Havana, Cuba, and from Havana, he got to Miami,

350
00:18:27.368 --> 00:18:31.711
and Miami, he got to New York, at which point

351
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:36.692
his former doctoral professor had emigrated

352
00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:40.357
and eventually got a job at Berkeley.

353
00:18:40.357 --> 00:18:43.107
And at Berkeley he essentially married

354
00:18:43.107 --> 00:18:45.561
the first girl who walked into his classroom.

355
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:47.563
And got his citizenship, and was protected.

356
00:18:47.563 --> 00:18:48.645
<v Voiceover>Well, that was smart.</v>

357
00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:50.556
Did he speak English prior to arriving here?

358
00:18:50.556 --> 00:18:53.244
<v ->He was very learned, he spoke five languages,</v>

359
00:18:53.244 --> 00:18:56.113
very articulate, and,

360
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:02.886
you know, eventually found himself back in the war.

361
00:19:02.886 --> 00:19:07.431
And the point I chose

362
00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:10.478
to open this book is in Belgium.

363
00:19:10.478 --> 00:19:14.915
And Walter Horn is a young lieutenant,

364
00:19:14.915 --> 00:19:18.487
and he's with Patton's army, and they're about to

365
00:19:18.487 --> 00:19:20.753
march into Germany, cross the Rhine River

366
00:19:20.753 --> 00:19:22.059
and go into Germany.

367
00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:25.173
But Walter's got very mixed feelings

368
00:19:25.173 --> 00:19:26.462
about what's going on.

369
00:19:26.462 --> 00:19:28.724
A, he's on the SS hit list,

370
00:19:28.724 --> 00:19:32.535
and so he knows if he's captured, he will be killed.

371
00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:38.103
He also, you know, sees the bombers going overhead

372
00:19:38.103 --> 00:19:42.665
at this point, the German air force

373
00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:45.294
has essentially been wiped out

374
00:19:45.294 --> 00:19:48.146
and so we have these armadas, these, you know,

375
00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.467
giant numbers, hundreds sometimes,

376
00:19:50.467 --> 00:19:53.022
seven, 800 planes at a time,

377
00:19:53.022 --> 00:19:55.967
going over, doing, you know, bombing Germany.

378
00:19:55.967 --> 00:19:59.735
And he's worried,

379
00:19:59.735 --> 00:20:02.177
you know, his family's still in Heidelberg.

380
00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:07.735
He doesn't know almost any day.

381
00:20:07.735 --> 00:20:10.141
I mean, he's been working as an interpreter,

382
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:13.012
he's been interrogating captured soldiers,

383
00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:16.547
he doesn't know, you know, when his classmates

384
00:20:16.547 --> 00:20:19.843
are gonna show up, when his brother is going to show up.

385
00:20:21.057 --> 00:20:22.362
So he's got very mixed feelings,

386
00:20:22.362 --> 00:20:27.050
and while all of that's going on, Patton has discovered

387
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.985
that Himmler has a secret vault in Nuremberg.

388
00:20:31.985 --> 00:20:35.022
And it's in a, believed, it's supposed

389
00:20:35.022 --> 00:20:37.634
that this is where the crown jewels are,

390
00:20:37.634 --> 00:20:39.983
and so Patton wants them back.

391
00:20:39.983 --> 00:20:42.792
Patton wants the coillection, and he's searching

392
00:20:42.792 --> 00:20:47.772
through his, you know, metaphoric Rolodex of soldiers

393
00:20:47.772 --> 00:20:51.205
serving under him for A, someone who speaks German,

394
00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:53.452
and two, someone who knows something

395
00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:57.386
about ancient history

396
00:20:57.386 --> 00:20:59.230
and modern Germany

397
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.160
and here all of a sudden, Walt, you have this ideal,

398
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.162
perfect candidate.

399
00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:08.277
It's like you couldn't, Steven Spielberg

400
00:21:08.277 --> 00:21:13.134
couldn't come up with a more perfect candidate

401
00:21:13.134 --> 00:21:17.612
to send on a mission to recover these artifacts.

402
00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:22.069
And it's really only because of who Walter is,

403
00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:25.956
the fact that he was such a scholar and studied

404
00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:30.814
in Germany, that he's able to actually ultimately

405
00:21:30.814 --> 00:21:31.910
return them.

406
00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.171
Because it's who he knew as a student,

407
00:21:34.171 --> 00:21:38.405
the, you know, soldier, the classmates who, unlike him,

408
00:21:38.405 --> 00:21:43.290
stayed behind versus he had fled.

409
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.021
But in order to

410
00:21:47.331 --> 00:21:50.814
succeed in his mission, he has to revist

411
00:21:50.814 --> 00:21:54.401
much of his own past, and much of his family's past.

412
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:57.314
But, that early Nazi era,

413
00:21:57.314 --> 00:22:00.807
and it's a really incredible story.

414
00:22:00.807 --> 00:22:04.324
<v Voiceover>So, I mean, obviously he ultimately</v>

415
00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:05.721
succeeded in this.

416
00:22:05.721 --> 00:22:08.651
Can you give us a couple of hints about

417
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:13.029
some of the obstacles or adventures along the way

418
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:15.709
prior to his procuring it?

419
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:20.245
<v ->Well, I think for him, the most important revelation,</v>

420
00:22:20.245 --> 00:22:22.194
and it was really frightening,

421
00:22:22.194 --> 00:22:25.581
was that the very team of

422
00:22:27.654 --> 00:22:32.601
civilians, when I say civilians, I mean German nationals

423
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:36.176
that the occupation forces had hired

424
00:22:36.176 --> 00:22:39.865
to help assist,

425
00:22:39.865 --> 00:22:44.862
assist the allied forces.

426
00:22:44.862 --> 00:22:48.376
Many of them were deeply entrenched Nazis.

427
00:22:48.376 --> 00:22:52.944
Many of them were, there's a group called The Werewolves

428
00:22:52.944 --> 00:22:55.491
who were,

429
00:22:55.491 --> 00:22:58.882
as the Nazi regime

430
00:22:58.882 --> 00:23:00.925
was falling apart,

431
00:23:03.254 --> 00:23:05.683
Hitler, Himmler especially,

432
00:23:05.683 --> 00:23:09.681
could see the writing on the wall, so they planted

433
00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:13.073
civilian, you know, they planted ardent Nazis.

434
00:23:13.073 --> 00:23:14.217
<v Voiceover>As werewolves.</v>

435
00:23:14.217 --> 00:23:18.036
<v ->In civilian garb to help</v>

436
00:23:18.036 --> 00:23:19.703
the allied occupation.

437
00:23:19.703 --> 00:23:21.727
What they really were were spies.

438
00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:26.610
So I think that the most terrifying revelation

439
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.842
is, you know, to Horn's point of view was that

440
00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:33.175
plans were really made for a fourth reich.

441
00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:37.121
And to pull that fourth reich off,

442
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:40.769
they wanted to keep hold of, you know,

443
00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:43.692
these relics, the Spear of Destiny.

444
00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:47.223
<v Voiceover>So what happened then</v>

445
00:23:47.223 --> 00:23:50.837
once they were accurate in having located it

446
00:23:50.837 --> 00:23:54.257
and they were able to procure the spear,

447
00:23:54.257 --> 00:23:55.528
free the spear.

448
00:23:55.528 --> 00:23:57.217
What happened then kind of politically

449
00:23:57.217 --> 00:23:58.454
and within the military

450
00:23:58.454 --> 00:24:01.294
with Patton, Eisenhower was involved as well?

451
00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:03.308
What happened from there?

452
00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.718
<v ->Well, it was a,</v>

453
00:24:08.256 --> 00:24:10.837
it became a public relations issue

454
00:24:10.837 --> 00:24:15.115
because exciting, as heroic

455
00:24:15.115 --> 00:24:18.571
a story as, you know, American ingenuity

456
00:24:18.571 --> 00:24:22.655
reclaiming these holy relics,

457
00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:25.831
when you truly examine the story,

458
00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:29.491
examine how they were found and who helped,

459
00:24:30.798 --> 00:24:32.106
you had several.

460
00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:35.515
You had a German Jewish ex-patriot

461
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:37.915
on the back of a motorcycle,

462
00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:40.543
and you had Walter Horn

463
00:24:40.543 --> 00:24:44.664
who had fled Nazi Germany.

464
00:24:44.664 --> 00:24:47.764
You had a number of

465
00:24:47.764 --> 00:24:51.032
spies, per se, former Nazis.

466
00:24:51.032 --> 00:24:55.657
So, you had this cabal which was very difficult to sell

467
00:24:57.584 --> 00:25:00.427
to the American public, and so they kept it all quiet.

468
00:25:00.427 --> 00:25:03.853
Plus, I think the whole subject

469
00:25:03.853 --> 00:25:06.052
of a fourth reich

470
00:25:06.052 --> 00:25:08.830
was not a subject that

471
00:25:10.157 --> 00:25:13.980
the American government wanted to talk about

472
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.012
in any great length.

473
00:25:16.012 --> 00:25:20.006
Even like the Nuremberg trials, for example.

474
00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:22.585
That subject is hardly touched upon,

475
00:25:22.585 --> 00:25:25.552
just as the whole spiritual

476
00:25:28.853 --> 00:25:30.160
philosophy.

477
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.446
So much of

478
00:25:33.053 --> 00:25:36.147
the esoteric aspects of Nazism

479
00:25:36.147 --> 00:25:40.301
were not covered in the Nuremberg trials.

480
00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:42.947
And I think that was a conscious decision

481
00:25:42.947 --> 00:25:44.732
not to go that direction.

482
00:25:44.732 --> 00:25:45.783
<v Voiceover>Into the occult.</v>

483
00:25:45.783 --> 00:25:46.564
<v ->Right.</v>

484
00:25:46.564 --> 00:25:47.698
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

485
00:25:47.698 --> 00:25:52.514
So, the spear's relationship to the fourth reich

486
00:25:52.514 --> 00:25:54.888
and the importance of having this spear

487
00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:57.200
for the establishment of the fourth reich,

488
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.482
you're saying this is really terrifying to him,

489
00:25:59.482 --> 00:26:01.793
and this is something that certainly the American military,

490
00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:04.163
why did they, in hindsight, why did they

491
00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:06.426
not want to release that information?

492
00:26:08.896 --> 00:26:11.698
<v ->Well, a combination of reasons.</v>

493
00:26:11.698 --> 00:26:16.011
I think Eisenhower especially,

494
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:20.271
he wanted to A, put the past behind them,

495
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:22.229
they also didn't wanna hold

496
00:26:23.602 --> 00:26:27.681
all Germans responsible for the war.

497
00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:33.711
And I think they made certain decisions

498
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:36.630
about what the story was to be.

499
00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:41.349
Who would be prosecuted for war crimes

500
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.177
and how and why.

501
00:26:43.177 --> 00:26:46.274
There was also a certain embarrassment factor

502
00:26:46.274 --> 00:26:48.659
in Europe because the very people

503
00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:51.670
they had that the allied army

504
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.404
had Germans,

505
00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:57.993
the very Germans that the allied army hired

506
00:26:57.993 --> 00:27:02.912
to protect these things actually turned out to be Nazis.

507
00:27:04.204 --> 00:27:06.663
And so, that was an embarrassing factor,

508
00:27:06.663 --> 00:27:09.415
they didn't wanna go there.

509
00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:13.214
The real issue was keeping the spear,

510
00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:16.084
and there was a lot of that, there was a lot of it.

511
00:27:16.084 --> 00:27:19.235
Patton wanted it, and didn't see any reason

512
00:27:19.235 --> 00:27:21.083
why they should give it up.

513
00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:25.382
In fact, he was making a pretty compelling argument

514
00:27:25.382 --> 00:27:26.911
not to give it up.

515
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:30.225
That if this was truly, this was more than

516
00:27:30.225 --> 00:27:34.158
just an artifact, this was a symbol

517
00:27:34.158 --> 00:27:37.244
of world monarchy, and are you gonna give it back

518
00:27:37.244 --> 00:27:40.814
to the Austrians or the Germans?

519
00:27:40.814 --> 00:27:42.027
<v Voiceover>What was his rationale?</v>

520
00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:47.010
<v ->You could almost consider it an article of war,</v>

521
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.830
a symbol of war.

522
00:27:50.584 --> 00:27:51.992
<v Voiceover>So what was his rationale as to why</v>

523
00:27:51.992 --> 00:27:55.461
he should have kept it?

524
00:27:55.461 --> 00:27:57.689
Because besides his, we know, his personality

525
00:27:57.689 --> 00:27:58.594
and that he would have wanted it?

526
00:27:58.594 --> 00:27:59.919
<v ->Yeah, and he wanted it,</v>

527
00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:03.122
but according to war reparations,

528
00:28:03.122 --> 00:28:05.631
art, you know, just like the art that was looted

529
00:28:05.631 --> 00:28:08.173
from The Louvre gets returned to The Louvre.

530
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.218
This was looted

531
00:28:13.218 --> 00:28:15.589
from Austria and should be returned to Austria.

532
00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:16.875
<v Voiceover>But he was trying to circumvent that.</v>

533
00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:18.586
He must have had some rationale.

534
00:28:18.586 --> 00:28:19.887
<v ->Yes, he was, and you know,</v>

535
00:28:19.887 --> 00:28:23.048
if he didn't die suddenly,

536
00:28:23.048 --> 00:28:26.597
the United States might actually well have kept it.

537
00:28:26.597 --> 00:28:30.083
There's all kinds of conspiracy theories going on

538
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:33.282
that we did keep it.

539
00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:35.325
I don't buy into them.

540
00:28:35.325 --> 00:28:39.395
There's even one conspiracy theory that Walter Horn

541
00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:44.295
and the GI who was sent to recover it

542
00:28:44.295 --> 00:28:46.580
actually brought it back with him to California.

543
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.401
I don't buy it, but there was one afternoon I know

544
00:28:53.488 --> 00:28:56.289
from Walter's friends

545
00:28:56.289 --> 00:28:58.811
in Point Richmond, California,

546
00:28:58.811 --> 00:29:00.441
right outside of San Francisco

547
00:29:00.441 --> 00:29:03.401
that somebody was actually digging in Walter's yard

548
00:29:03.401 --> 00:29:06.218
looking for this spear that he believed

549
00:29:06.218 --> 00:29:08.026
Walter had hidden there.

550
00:29:08.026 --> 00:29:10.047
<v Voiceover>Didn't it end up back in Austria?</v>

551
00:29:10.047 --> 00:29:12.936
<v ->Yes, and it's in Austria, and it's on display today.</v>

552
00:29:12.936 --> 00:29:14.020
<v Voiceover>And furthermore--</v>

553
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.080
<v ->But there's an argument that that's not the real spear.</v>

554
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.251
<v Voiceover>Well, I was going to ask you about that</v>

555
00:29:19.251 --> 00:29:21.448
because, as I was reading in your book,

556
00:29:21.448 --> 00:29:24.085
I think, didn't you say they were maybe three, four

557
00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:26.171
different versions of this?

558
00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:29.865
<v ->Yes, and I mean some are patently not the spear,</v>

559
00:29:29.865 --> 00:29:34.060
but we know Himmler made copies.

560
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.844
Made copies of the entire collection of holy relics.

561
00:29:41.306 --> 00:29:43.848
Studies have been done on this spear

562
00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:47.306
that's now on display in Austria.

563
00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:48.808
<v Voiceover>The forensics, that's what I was going to</v>

564
00:29:48.808 --> 00:29:50.775
ask you about, and that was 2003,

565
00:29:50.775 --> 00:29:51.857
so recent history.

566
00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:54.291
<v ->Yeah, and you know, which compelling arguments</v>

567
00:29:54.291 --> 00:29:57.388
that that spear is the one

568
00:29:57.388 --> 00:30:00.283
that Hitler took from Austria.

569
00:30:00.283 --> 00:30:04.649
That it may not go right back to the crucifixion

570
00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:06.434
and probably didn't.

571
00:30:06.434 --> 00:30:09.547
However, that was the spear that had been venerated

572
00:30:09.547 --> 00:30:12.476
for five or 600 years

573
00:30:12.476 --> 00:30:15.266
prior to Napoleon going after it, and prior

574
00:30:15.266 --> 00:30:18.482
to Hitler actually going after and getting it.

575
00:30:18.482 --> 00:30:22.007
<v Voiceover>So, whether it's the real spear or not,</v>

576
00:30:22.007 --> 00:30:25.561
we're talking about, still, the fulfillment

577
00:30:25.561 --> 00:30:27.547
in carrying forward over prophesy.

578
00:30:27.547 --> 00:30:28.404
<v ->Yes.</v>

579
00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:29.654
<v Voiceover>And it's become symbolic.</v>

580
00:30:29.654 --> 00:30:31.605
So, as you see it today,

581
00:30:31.605 --> 00:30:34.208
as it rests in Vienna, is it in Vienna?

582
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.092
<v ->Mmhm.</v>

583
00:30:35.092 --> 00:30:36.399
<v Voiceover>As it rests in Vienna,</v>

584
00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:40.109
what, whether it's this conspiracy world or not,

585
00:30:40.109 --> 00:30:42.478
what does this represent, this sure existence

586
00:30:42.478 --> 00:30:44.967
of this particular artifact now.

587
00:30:46.415 --> 00:30:49.070
<v ->It's a very good question because,</v>

588
00:30:51.393 --> 00:30:52.558
it's a big debate.

589
00:30:52.558 --> 00:30:54.583
Does it belong in a church?

590
00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:56.215
Does it belong in a church collection?

591
00:30:56.215 --> 00:30:58.461
Does it belong to the state?

592
00:30:58.461 --> 00:31:01.112
Is it a work of art?

593
00:31:01.112 --> 00:31:04.387
Or is it a religious icon?

594
00:31:06.407 --> 00:31:08.709
It depends how you're looking at it.

595
00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:11.153
So to answer that question, it really depends

596
00:31:11.153 --> 00:31:12.215
how you're looking at it.

597
00:31:12.215 --> 00:31:14.442
General Patton looked at it one way,

598
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.783
Himmler and Hitler looked at it another.

599
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:24.004
Walter Horn was coming at it as an art historian,

600
00:31:24.004 --> 00:31:27.061
but also as a German.

601
00:31:27.061 --> 00:31:30.398
And, you know, he recognized its significance

602
00:31:30.398 --> 00:31:33.848
because, you know, its significance is really based

603
00:31:33.848 --> 00:31:37.099
on what you decide you're gonna put on that.

604
00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:42.506
I dunno, do you believe

605
00:31:42.506 --> 00:31:44.035
that it belongs in a museum

606
00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.983
or do you believe it ought to

607
00:31:46.983 --> 00:31:50.740
belong in the hands of a world emperor?

608
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.324
<v Voiceover>Yeah, well, I mean,</v>

609
00:31:52.324 --> 00:31:56.538
if I were voting, I'd probably put it in a museum. (laughs)

610
00:31:58.034 --> 00:32:02.315
So, what are some, for you,

611
00:32:02.315 --> 00:32:04.822
in going through this journey, and especially

612
00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:05.868
with some of the background.

613
00:32:05.868 --> 00:32:07.973
You're steeped in a lot of different histories,

614
00:32:07.973 --> 00:32:09.765
including a lot of the histories of what came through

615
00:32:09.765 --> 00:32:13.316
Edgar Cayce as you're the biographer of Cayce and such.

616
00:32:13.316 --> 00:32:17.329
Are there any other thoughts about what this kind of

617
00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:23.274
artifact and prophesy means to you personally.

618
00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.345
After you were done with this study.

619
00:32:27.331 --> 00:32:30.225
<v ->One of the things Edgar Cayce often talked about</v>

620
00:32:30.225 --> 00:32:34.490
was how objects, the history of an object

621
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.786
is actually contained within the object

622
00:32:36.786 --> 00:32:39.628
and if you know how to read the energy

623
00:32:39.628 --> 00:32:42.789
around a particular object, you will know its history.

624
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:46.051
And actually, there were psychics,

625
00:32:46.051 --> 00:32:48.972
Peter Hurkos for example, the Dutch psychic

626
00:32:48.972 --> 00:32:52.716
had that power to hold onto something and read it.

627
00:32:52.716 --> 00:32:53.985
<v Voiceover>Yes, psychometry.</v>

628
00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:55.634
Did anyone do that with the Spear of Destiny.

629
00:32:55.634 --> 00:32:56.438
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

630
00:32:56.438 --> 00:32:58.004
<v Voiceover>Oh please, do tell.</v>

631
00:32:58.004 --> 00:33:01.210
<v ->Well, I mean, perhaps one of the most interesting</v>

632
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.082
figure in its history.

633
00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:06.573
I mean, we know the great emperors from, you know,

634
00:33:06.573 --> 00:33:09.250
Constantine to Frederick Barbarossa--

635
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.273
<v Voiceover>Charlemagne in there on it?</v>

636
00:33:11.273 --> 00:33:13.190
<v ->Yep, Charlemagne.</v>

637
00:33:14.507 --> 00:33:18.596
Is, Anne Catherine Emmerich who was a German nun.

638
00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:22.388
And like Hildegard von Bingen, she would

639
00:33:22.388 --> 00:33:25.071
fall into an ecstasy.

640
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:27.505
She actually had stigmata, you know,

641
00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.517
where you develop...

642
00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:36.914
Anne Catherine Emmerich, when she fell into ecstasy

643
00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:40.707
didn't create music like Hildegard did,

644
00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:43.784
what she was able to do was hold an object

645
00:33:43.784 --> 00:33:48.524
and describe what, you know, the visions she saw

646
00:33:48.524 --> 00:33:51.260
when she was in ecstasy like that.

647
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.517
And it's actually...

648
00:33:58.625 --> 00:34:01.564
Many trips were made to her nunnery

649
00:34:01.564 --> 00:34:04.111
to give her objects to hold.

650
00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:06.543
And royalty, you know,

651
00:34:08.163 --> 00:34:10.407
Spanish royalty would come all the way

652
00:34:10.407 --> 00:34:13.242
to Germany to let her hold something.

653
00:34:13.242 --> 00:34:18.188
And there was a long period where they were testing

654
00:34:18.188 --> 00:34:20.299
medieval artifacts.

655
00:34:20.299 --> 00:34:22.355
Are these the real thing, because of course,

656
00:34:22.355 --> 00:34:26.710
we know relics at various points were produced on demand.

657
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:31.638
And so she was given the Spear of Destiny to hold.

658
00:34:31.638 --> 00:34:34.921
And it's very very well documented,

659
00:34:34.921 --> 00:34:39.775
but she went into a reverie, and an ecstasy

660
00:34:39.775 --> 00:34:44.050
and described the crucifixion

661
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.968
in minute detail.

662
00:34:46.968 --> 00:34:50.993
Nothing that would contradict gospel,

663
00:34:50.993 --> 00:34:53.792
but minute detail,

664
00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:57.426
almost from the point of view of Longinus.

665
00:34:58.623 --> 00:35:02.176
What he saw, who was there, what Jesus looked like,

666
00:35:02.176 --> 00:35:04.338
the color of his eyes, his hair,

667
00:35:04.338 --> 00:35:08.636
and it's actually her work

668
00:35:08.636 --> 00:35:12.676
that Mel Gibson used as the basis

669
00:35:12.676 --> 00:35:16.578
for the movie Passion of Christ.

670
00:35:16.578 --> 00:35:20.087
And, so as Catherine Emmerich

671
00:35:20.087 --> 00:35:21.936
was holding this spear,

672
00:35:21.936 --> 00:35:24.304
she developed stigmata again,

673
00:35:24.304 --> 00:35:27.260
and you know, a wound opened on her chest,

674
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.434
and she began, you know, to bleed.

675
00:35:30.931 --> 00:35:35.129
So, it's a, this spear is wrapped up

676
00:35:35.129 --> 00:35:40.091
with so much, so many interesting, fascinating aspects

677
00:35:40.091 --> 00:35:43.797
that it's very difficult to deny that there isn't

678
00:35:43.797 --> 00:35:45.300
something going on.

679
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.976
With what's going on, I couldn't tell you,

680
00:35:48.976 --> 00:35:51.585
but there's certainly something going on.

681
00:35:51.585 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Voiceover>Does that document still exist</v>

682
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.953
of her reading of the object.

683
00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:56.050
<v ->Yes, absolutely, yes.</v>

684
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.118
You can find it, it's been published

685
00:35:59.118 --> 00:36:02.895
and her reveries have been published.

686
00:36:02.895 --> 00:36:05.384
Two volume set.

687
00:36:05.384 --> 00:36:06.484
<v Voiceover>Tell me again.</v>

688
00:36:06.484 --> 00:36:07.837
<v ->Anne Catherine Emmerich.</v>

689
00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:10.243
<v Voiceover>Anne Catherine Emmerich.</v>

690
00:36:10.243 --> 00:36:11.111
<v ->Right.</v>

691
00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:12.488
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

692
00:36:12.488 --> 00:36:14.419
Very interesting one.

693
00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:16.140
I'm so glad we got to that piece.

694
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.361
That's where the story starts really thickening,

695
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:20.061
and for the rest of the story, I think people

696
00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:21.764
will just have to pick up a copy of the book

697
00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:23.799
otherwise we'll be sitting here for the next six hours

698
00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:25.299
and we both have flights to catch.

699
00:36:25.299 --> 00:36:27.869
<v ->There is a wonderful twist and turn.</v>

700
00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:29.018
<v Voiceover>Oh, tell me.</v>

701
00:36:29.018 --> 00:36:31.563
<v ->Because a lot of people ask,</v>

702
00:36:31.563 --> 00:36:34.781
they believe the book almost to be fictional

703
00:36:34.781 --> 00:36:38.770
because I'd been able to write it with such specificity.

704
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:39.907
<v Voiceover>We talked about that off camera, yes.</v>

705
00:36:41.905 --> 00:36:45.366
<v ->I was able to do that because</v>

706
00:36:45.366 --> 00:36:50.034
I had an amazing trunk of documents and

707
00:36:57.114 --> 00:37:00.385
there was a point where Caroline Kennedy.

708
00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.371
<v Voiceover>Yes, I wanted to know about that.</v>

709
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.042
Yeah, the Jacqueline Kennedy connection.

710
00:37:04.042 --> 00:37:06.772
<v ->Because Walter Horn came back from the war,</v>

711
00:37:06.772 --> 00:37:09.664
created a great family,

712
00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:13.304
and eventually became

713
00:37:13.304 --> 00:37:16.486
the head of the Berkeley art history department.

714
00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:19.510
And in one of the lectures,

715
00:37:20.931 --> 00:37:24.233
which was attended by Caroline Kennedy, that had,

716
00:37:25.588 --> 00:37:27.519
he talked about his World War II adventures

717
00:37:27.519 --> 00:37:29.710
which she was very excited about,

718
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:34.139
and you know, very interesting, compelling story.

719
00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:37.676
She came home and talked to her mother Jackie Kennedy

720
00:37:37.676 --> 00:37:40.826
about what an exciting character

721
00:37:40.826 --> 00:37:42.107
this Walter Horn was.

722
00:37:42.107 --> 00:37:43.091
<v Voiceover>And she was in the publishing business</v>

723
00:37:43.091 --> 00:37:44.214
at that time.

724
00:37:44.214 --> 00:37:45.990
<v ->Yes, she was an editor of Doubleday.</v>

725
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.836
And so she contracted,

726
00:37:48.836 --> 00:37:51.476
you know, to get a Walter Horn book.

727
00:37:51.476 --> 00:37:56.424
And they conducted several, I think it's ultimately

728
00:37:56.424 --> 00:37:59.548
almost a thousand pages of interviews.

729
00:37:59.548 --> 00:38:00.528
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

730
00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:04.787
<v ->And then, Walter died, she died,</v>

731
00:38:04.787 --> 00:38:08.583
project went south, and it went into a trunk

732
00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:12.471
and I was very fortunate to have access to it.

733
00:38:12.471 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Voiceover>Meant to be.</v>

734
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.488
Well, congratulations on that.

735
00:38:16.488 --> 00:38:18.109
It's a wonderful work.

736
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:19.324
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

737
00:38:19.324 --> 00:38:20.620
<v ->So, until next time,</v>

738
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.216
thank you again for taking the time with us.

739
00:38:26.008 --> 00:38:28.517
This fascinating account of the mystical undertones

740
00:38:28.517 --> 00:38:30.653
of World War II can be delved into

741
00:38:30.653 --> 00:38:33.421
by picking up a copy of Hitler's Holy Relics

742
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:35.864
at Amazon or other major booksellers.

743
00:38:35.864 --> 00:38:38.476
To learn more of this subject but from a different angle,

744
00:38:38.476 --> 00:38:41.087
you might also enjoy my interview with Jim Marrs

745
00:38:41.087 --> 00:38:43.578
on the continuation of a Nazi agenda

746
00:38:43.578 --> 00:38:45.441
into modern day politics.

747
00:38:45.441 --> 00:38:47.920
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
