00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:03.488
<v ->A surgeon by trade and a renegade at heart,</v>

2
00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:05.724
Dr. Harvey Bigelsen has been looking for the

3
00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:08.560
Holy Grail of healing his entire life.

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.561
After serving as the president of Arizona's

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.698
Homeopathic Board, Harvey began pushing the envelope

6
00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:17.402
in the world of healing, including his awe inspiring work in

7
00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:20.840
decoding holographic images in human blood.

8
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.040
For this he was charged with defrauding the Medicare

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.949
system by assisting clients to have their alternative

10
00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.319
therapies covered, a common practice in the medical field.

11
00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.818
The total fine was $3,500.

12
00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:34.450
For this, he lost his medical license.

13
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.720
One only has to scratch a little deeper to find out

14
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.490
there may be more to the story.

15
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.008
(mysterious music)

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Regina>You are a renegade, by all accounts,</v>

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.378
at this, in this subject and you're an MD,

18
00:00:55.378 --> 00:00:59.244
you've chosen to basically unplug from the system

19
00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:02.280
so that you can go ahead and do what you do best

20
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.790
without having to be under the scrutiny of the AMA

21
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.160
and other organizations and agencies, right?

22
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.720
<v ->Correct.</v>

23
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Regina>So, that said, give us a little bit of</v>

24
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.559
background about the nature of your work before

25
00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.928
we dive into the specifics.

26
00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:18.930
<v ->There are two basic philosophies that have</v>

27
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.299
gone on since Hippocrates.

28
00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.670
Hippocrates, Harris Coulter wrote in Divided Legacy,

29
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.968
he called Hippocrates an empirical physician.

30
00:01:28.968 --> 00:01:30.947
Several hundred years later, Galen comes up

31
00:01:30.947 --> 00:01:33.712
with another, opposing view of healthcare

32
00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:36.014
and he becomes a rationalist.

33
00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:39.751
Hippocrates basically said that the body is intelligent

34
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.418
and knows the whole show.

35
00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:44.188
He was a homeopathic philosopher.

36
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:48.028
If the body's dumping a waste, help the body dump the waste.

37
00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:50.998
He comes up with that type of philosophy.

38
00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:53.198
Galen then comes up with the exact opposite

39
00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:55.968
type of philosophy that if the body's having diarrhea,

40
00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:57.268
stop it up.

41
00:01:57.268 --> 00:01:58.836
Nose is running, stop it up.

42
00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:02.078
Galen's philosophy becomes allopathic medicine,

43
00:02:02.078 --> 00:02:05.377
opposite philosophy to the pathology that's now

44
00:02:05.377 --> 00:02:07.317
dominant in our society.

45
00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:10.148
Hippocrates' philosophy, I deal with that.

46
00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:12.178
That's empirical philosophy.

47
00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:14.657
Bring it up to today, what are the two differences

48
00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:16.288
in philosophy?

49
00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:19.057
Today, there were two great mistakes made

50
00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:22.443
in history, oh, over a century ago.

51
00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.216
Possibly, oh, how could I say it,

52
00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.469
oh, purposefully made mistakes or purposefully

53
00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.371
picked up by the establishment.

54
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.305
Pasteur makes a great mistake.

55
00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:36.440
Pasteur says a hundred some odd years ago

56
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.612
that germs cause disease

57
00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:41.947
and he comes up with, and germs never change,

58
00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:44.115
a strep is always a strep.

59
00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:47.486
Pasteur's philosophy becomes the dominant philosophy today.

60
00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.487
The germ theory of disease, if you've got the germ theory

61
00:02:49.487 --> 00:02:51.222
of disease, you can have the magic bullet

62
00:02:51.222 --> 00:02:53.391
philosophy of therapy.

63
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:56.795
So now we have find the name, find the magic bullet.

64
00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:58.529
Everything is a magic bullet philosophy,

65
00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.532
that's what the whole system is.

66
00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:04.268
Pasteur's rival, Antoine Bechamp, says, "no, germs live in

67
00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:06.237
"a disease terrain

68
00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:08.406
"and germs change and adapt, are constantly

69
00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:09.341
"changing and adapting.

70
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.076
"A bacteria can become a fungus,

71
00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:12.944
"they can become a virus, they can change

72
00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:14.945
"and adapt to the terrain."

73
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.849
Well, first of all, everything changes in our society.

74
00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.152
Seasons change, trees change, we change,

75
00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:23.062
why doesn't the single-most primordial form of life change?

76
00:03:23.062 --> 00:03:24.122
Of course it does.

77
00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:25.460
<v Regina>Our blood?</v>

78
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.825
<v ->Well, I'm talking about the one-celled organism, the germ.</v>

79
00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:29.494
The germ changes, that changes.

80
00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:32.097
If everything else changes, that'll change.

81
00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:34.032
If I throw seeds to asphalt, nothing grows,

82
00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:37.368
but if I put seeds in manure, everything grows.

83
00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:40.238
Pasteur, on his deathbed, recants

84
00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:43.390
and says he is wrong and Bechamp is right.

85
00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Regina>Well, it's interesting, you don't hear a</v>

86
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.378
whole lot about Bechamp out there.

87
00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:49.148
Everyone knows who Louis Pasteur is.

88
00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:51.883
<v ->Right and that's because we've had now a whole</v>

89
00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:54.151
system based on Pasteur.

90
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Regina>Even after he recanted?</v>

91
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.556
<v ->Even after he recanted because that's suppressed</v>

92
00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:02.026
and that's historical, his recantation, on his deathbed.

93
00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:03.395
<v Regina>Very interesting.</v>

94
00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:06.064
<v ->He said the germ is nothing, the terrain is everything,</v>

95
00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:07.098
Bechamp is right.

96
00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:08.700
<v Regina>And this is really where you're coming from.</v>

97
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.334
<v ->Yes.</v>

98
00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:10.001
<v Regina>Terrain is everything.</v>

99
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:11.202
<v ->Everything.</v>

100
00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:13.205
And I'm gonna come back with another theory,

101
00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:14.839
cause there was another theory that I'm coming from

102
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.041
that I'm gonna put that together into one package.

103
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Regina>Before you do, now the terrain, in this case,</v>

104
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.545
is the blood.

105
00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:22.714
<v ->Terrain is, no, it's, you are the terrain.</v>

106
00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:24.883
Your thymus gland, your thyroid gland, your heart,

107
00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:26.485
<v Regina>Oh, okay.</v>
<v ->It's one big terrain.</v>

108
00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:27.418
<v Regina>Oh, okay.</v>

109
00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:30.188
<v ->I'll give you an example of terrain of cancer, okay?</v>

110
00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:33.325
Cancer we're looking at is one cell that goes wild,

111
00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:35.735
it grows into a tumor, into a mass, that invades

112
00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:38.964
into a blood vessel or lymphatic cells break off

113
00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:40.565
and they scatter and metastasize

114
00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:43.567
and it's a whole random concept, okay,

115
00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.137
one cell going wild.

116
00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.005
Let's come into that whole concept.

117
00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:48.773
First of all, the way I look at it, number one,

118
00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:50.774
is if I have a cream cheese with a mold on it,

119
00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:52.475
and I cut the mold off, the rest of the cream cheese

120
00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:55.584
is still rotten, next day you'll have 12 spots.

121
00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:58.015
Cancer is a mold.

122
00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.083
Okay?

123
00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.425
It's a mold on a peach, you cut the mold of the peach off,

124
00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:03.694
the rest of the peach is still rotten,

125
00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:04.995
it's ready to go that way.

126
00:05:04.995 --> 00:05:07.695
Prostate cancer only goes to the bones,

127
00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:09.455
there's nothing random about that.

128
00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:13.404
Because the mold of prostate cancer feeds on calcium.

129
00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:15.300
When they took women and gave em hormonal replacement

130
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.302
therapy and they told them they had osteoporosis,

131
00:05:17.302 --> 00:05:19.103
and they give them calcium, they skyrocket

132
00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:20.505
in breast cancer.

133
00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:22.440
They set the ball game up.

134
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.175
So, I'm coming back to the whole story,

135
00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:27.078
I'm treating the whole cream cheese, okay?

136
00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:30.648
Let's come back to, though, a little bit different now.

137
00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:33.818
Before Pasteur, Charles Darwin

138
00:05:33.818 --> 00:05:35.753
makes two mistakes.

139
00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:38.056
Charles Darwin says, "everything is

140
00:05:38.056 --> 00:05:39.823
"survival of the fittest."

141
00:05:39.823 --> 00:05:42.266
We have developed a philosophy based on Darwin.

142
00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.763
We have, essentially if I'm stronger, I win.

143
00:05:44.763 --> 00:05:48.399
We have wars on drugs, we have wars on germs,

144
00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.668
we have wars on people, we've developed an

145
00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:54.238
antagonistic philosophy based on Darwin.

146
00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:57.869
Darwin also said that all change takes place by mutation.

147
00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:59.249
That was wrong too.

148
00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.279
That's accident or chance, I do not believe in accident

149
00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.709
or chance in this universe.

150
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:07.319
Darwin's predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck,

151
00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.421
states, "the universe, the creation was parasitic,

152
00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:13.224
"adaptive and symbiotic."

153
00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:15.868
If a bug eats a plant, the plant will die.

154
00:06:15.868 --> 00:06:19.699
The plant's gotta adapt and they become symbiotic.

155
00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.069
And he states that the whole creation's going to harmony,

156
00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.129
not to antagonism, okay?

157
00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:27.372
<v Regina>Nature thrives through cooperation?</v>

158
00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:29.074
<v ->It's cooperation.</v>

159
00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:31.976
Now, the difference that I am now, traditional physicians,

160
00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:33.545
obviously I'm very different.

161
00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:35.079
They're stuffing up the diarrhea,

162
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.614
I'm doing it the other way.

163
00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:39.049
Now, I look at traditional physicians as the Dutch boy

164
00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:42.754
at the dike, plugging up the leak with pharmacy and surgery.

165
00:06:42.754 --> 00:06:45.525
I look at the alternative physician as using vitamins,

166
00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:47.685
herbs, to plug up the dike.

167
00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:50.065
I'm rebuilding the dike.

168
00:06:50.065 --> 00:06:51.635
So I'm coming at it even another way,

169
00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:53.705
so I'm getting my own enemies that way.

170
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.200
The alternative physician is just

171
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.802
substituting a lot of this.

172
00:06:57.802 --> 00:07:01.005
Okay, basically, everything is adaptive,

173
00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:02.945
everything is symbiotic.

174
00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:05.145
We have now, we've been in alternative medicine,

175
00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:07.645
where people are doing parasite purges or cleanses.

176
00:07:07.645 --> 00:07:08.554
No.

177
00:07:08.554 --> 00:07:12.345
The worm is there, the germ is there for a purpose.

178
00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:15.153
Okay, that's what I mean that they're doing the same thing.

179
00:07:15.153 --> 00:07:17.355
If you understand the purpose of it, therefore,

180
00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:19.089
then you can understand what's going on

181
00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:21.259
and figure out the answer.

182
00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.029
<v Regina>Well, this brings up an obvious question,</v>

183
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.764
the word these days in alternative medicine

184
00:07:26.764 --> 00:07:29.216
is to detoxify.

185
00:07:31.103 --> 00:07:32.269
Okay, you can go at it.

186
00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:33.504
(both laugh)

187
00:07:33.504 --> 00:07:36.274
<v ->I do, when I do a study of the blood life,</v>

188
00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:38.672
if the blood is dirty, you need to clean it.

189
00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:40.444
<v ->But if the blood is not dirty,</v>

190
00:07:40.444 --> 00:07:43.381
you can detox all you want, what does that mean?

191
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:46.117
Okay, if the blood is dirty, I'll clean em up.

192
00:07:46.117 --> 00:07:48.320
If the blood is weak, I'll strengthen em up.

193
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.154
There's different things you do.

194
00:07:50.154 --> 00:07:52.357
The alternative medicine, you detox everyone

195
00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:53.557
and let's go into that.

196
00:07:53.557 --> 00:07:55.459
How much of that is a fad?

197
00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:57.128
We go on a juice fad.

198
00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:00.298
Okay, how many people eat 30 to 50 carrots at once?

199
00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:02.699
I think if the creator wanted you to have the carrot juice,

200
00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:04.369
he would have put a tap on the thing

201
00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:05.770
or on the tree.

202
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.040
I like to do, so a lot of these things are fads.

203
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.307
<v Regina>They're not in balance because you're</v>

204
00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:12.210
saying they're over saturation of nutrient groups

205
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.111
that's not normal.
<v Harvey>That's over sell.</v>

206
00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:16.313
It's only in the past 100 plus years that this is around.

207
00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:18.550
Okay, I spoke to, he was a great physician at an

208
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.185
election a couple years ago around here

209
00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:22.253
and someone asked him about fasting and he said,

210
00:08:22.253 --> 00:08:23.721
"I don't know of any animals that really

211
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:24.889
"go through fasting."

212
00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:25.756
<v Regina>Not intentionally.</v>

213
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:26.725
<v ->He says, "what about juicing?"</v>

214
00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:27.658
And he goes, "duh."

215
00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:28.893
(both laugh)

216
00:08:28.893 --> 00:08:31.196
Let's go back to nature and reality.

217
00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:33.464
I live by the KISS principle, Keep It Simple, Stupid,

218
00:08:33.464 --> 00:08:35.399
so you'll see a lot of my things.

219
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:38.069
I'm looking at every day, old cells are dying,

220
00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:39.470
new cells are being born,

221
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.438
there's a, every day is a different day in our lives.

222
00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:44.342
If I can improve your functioning today, over yesterday,

223
00:08:44.342 --> 00:08:46.644
improve your functioning tomorrow over today,

224
00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:49.580
next week over this week, and continue on that way

225
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.090
and if your asthma disappears, it's only a side-effect

226
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.720
of improving your functioning.

227
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Regina>Mmhmm, so, going to this subject of</v>

228
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.460
toxicity again, you said, "well, if you've got dirty blood,

229
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.758
"I clean it," what are some of the ways in which the blood

230
00:09:00.758 --> 00:09:04.300
can be cleaned under your understanding

231
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.430
of the principles?

232
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.600
<v ->(stammers) There's ways that I,</v>

233
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.100
remedies that I use that I'm working on the whole terrain.

234
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.137
I'm making that dike stronger,

235
00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:15.273
I'm making the bridge stronger, whatever it is.

236
00:09:15.273 --> 00:09:17.609
If I make you, you're better functioning,

237
00:09:17.609 --> 00:09:18.809
you will clean yourself.

238
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:22.012
If I make your liver stronger, it will metabolize better,

239
00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:24.248
it will clean itself better.

240
00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:26.384
<v Regina>So if a person does have dirty blood,</v>

241
00:09:26.384 --> 00:09:28.953
then how, what are the means by which you would

242
00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:32.456
start fortifying the liver or helping them detoxify?

243
00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:34.192
<v ->Well, I use remedies,</v>

244
00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:35.894
the remedies I use are very different.

245
00:09:35.894 --> 00:09:38.819
Very few people understand how to use isopathic remedies.

246
00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:41.357
These are live germs.

247
00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:44.569
I can actually make the liver stronger, function better.

248
00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:46.770
They're much much more potent than anything

249
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.440
you could possibly imagine.

250
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.675
I've also used animal tissue, just like animal

251
00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:52.343
stem-cell tissue.

252
00:09:52.343 --> 00:09:54.846
If you ran a four minute mile today, I can make your

253
00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:56.915
heart, your lungs stronger, your muscles stronger,

254
00:09:56.915 --> 00:09:58.950
tomorrow you run a three fifty mile.

255
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.686
It's essentially getting you more octane,

256
00:10:01.686 --> 00:10:03.053
getting you performing better.

257
00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:05.622
If you perform better, that's what we go on.

258
00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:07.258
So I do it in a combination of ways,

259
00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:08.759
not just my remedies.

260
00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:11.295
I'm heavily into the structure of the body.

261
00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:12.296
<v Regina>What's that mean?</v>

262
00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:14.599
<v ->Well, there are three great, to me, there are three</v>

263
00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:18.001
divine sciences that came up through history in healthcare.

264
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:20.071
The philosophy and the science of acupuncture

265
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:21.905
came up in Asia.

266
00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:24.475
The philosophy of homeopathy came up in Europe.

267
00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:26.310
I'm not saying homeopathic remedies,

268
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.746
but the whole philosophy of homeopathy came from Europe

269
00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:31.816
and the philosophy of structure and specific osteopathy

270
00:10:31.816 --> 00:10:34.119
came up in the United States.

271
00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:37.021
And if you put those three concepts together,

272
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:39.423
now you're really putting the package.

273
00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:42.510
The structure is very, very, very important.

274
00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:46.197
To me, the greatest American physician of all time

275
00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:47.932
was Andrew Taylor Still.

276
00:10:47.932 --> 00:10:49.166
<v Regina>Would you spell his name so we...</v>

277
00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:51.135
<v ->Andrew Taylor Still, just the way it sounds.</v>

278
00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:52.236
<v Regina>Taylor...</v>

279
00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:53.270
<v ->Still, S-T-I-L-L.</v>

280
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.405
<v Regina>S-T-I-L-L.</v>

281
00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:58.743
<v ->He founded the profession of osteopathy.</v>

282
00:10:58.743 --> 00:11:01.486
He stated, "disease cannot exist where

283
00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:03.825
"there are no obstructions."

284
00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:05.015
<v Regina>Very true.</v>

285
00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:07.184
<v ->And in the obstruction we have fluid flows and electrical</v>

286
00:11:07.184 --> 00:11:08.719
flows that go through the body.

287
00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:11.155
If you've got an obstruction, in that obstruction

288
00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:12.556
it will create a stagnation.

289
00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:15.326
In that stagnation, you get a dysbiosis.

290
00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:17.562
The germ is changing and adapting.

291
00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:18.663
<v Regina>That's another subject, too.</v>

292
00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:21.032
I wanna go into that, can we go into that now?

293
00:11:21.032 --> 00:11:21.899
<v ->Uh huh, sure.</v>

294
00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:23.600
<v Regina>Because it was always thought that a virus</v>

295
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.138
is a virus, a fungus is a fungus, bacteria's bacteria,

296
00:11:27.138 --> 00:11:29.239
but that is not necessarily true, is it?

297
00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:33.177
<v ->No, that's just been propaganda you've been handed to.</v>

298
00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:37.248
I call so much of what's going on today Orwellian 1984.

299
00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:39.917
You've been propagandized that these are the things

300
00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:41.052
that are going on.

301
00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:42.860
<v Regina>And they've known for a long time, actually,</v>

302
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.988
this isn't true,

303
00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:46.457
cause I know that, I remember dealing with some Germans,

304
00:11:46.457 --> 00:11:48.793
20 years ago that had already seen this under

305
00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:50.728
a high-powered microscope that there's

306
00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:52.197
mutation that does occur.
<v Harvey>Well, you're gonna</v>

307
00:11:52.197 --> 00:11:54.099
find, it's not mutation, it's an adaptation.

308
00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:55.099
<v Regina>An adaptation, yeah.</v>

309
00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:57.991
<v ->But what's gone on in history, like I got,</v>

310
00:11:57.991 --> 00:12:01.205
the US and I, we've had our roundabouts.

311
00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:04.775
In history, people have done pleomorphic philosophy

312
00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:06.844
have been harassed and arrested.

313
00:12:06.844 --> 00:12:10.153
My counterpart in Germany just got out of jail,

314
00:12:10.153 --> 00:12:12.684
Ryke Hamer, he wrote the same things,

315
00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:14.652
he did the same type of work that I did,

316
00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:17.656
but he used cat scans of the brain,

317
00:12:17.656 --> 00:12:19.790
took up patterns of disease,

318
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.026
retired, went to Spain and they arrested him.

319
00:12:23.026 --> 00:12:25.429
Wilhelm Reich, who's one of my heroes,

320
00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:26.680
died in prison.

321
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.234
They did harass Royal, I'm the third one to do

322
00:12:30.234 --> 00:12:31.435
the pleomorphic work.

323
00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:33.104
Royal Rife was harassed, Virginia Livingston

324
00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:34.287
got away with it,

325
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.908
but they don't harass a lot of the people

326
00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:39.610
because they'll let em do the thing.

327
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.547
Anyone that's doing pleomorphic work is very,

328
00:12:42.547 --> 00:12:45.416
throughout history, has been suppressed.

329
00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:47.151
Paris Seltzis, one of my patron saints,

330
00:12:47.151 --> 00:12:49.254
was probably killed by him compatriots.

331
00:12:50.454 --> 00:12:52.022
<v Regina>Very interesting.</v>

332
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:55.465
<v ->Okay, this is a fight for several thousand years</v>

333
00:12:55.465 --> 00:12:56.910
and it's not nice.

334
00:12:58.328 --> 00:12:59.998
<v Regina>What is the objection to it?</v>

335
00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:01.332
Why is it suppressed?

336
00:13:01.332 --> 00:13:03.267
<v ->It's money.</v>

337
00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:05.636
It's plain and simple, it's money.

338
00:13:07.305 --> 00:13:10.074
The industry, and this goes back, actually in 1910,

339
00:13:10.074 --> 00:13:12.510
Rockefeller and Connehey got together

340
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.712
to decide where should they put their money,

341
00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:18.683
money was decided to be put into pharmaceutical medicine.

342
00:13:18.683 --> 00:13:20.751
43% of the schools in the United States were

343
00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:22.721
homeopathic at that time.

344
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:25.561
In 1947, Flower and Fifth Avenue, in New York

345
00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:28.692
was finally the one to lose it's homeopathic charter.

346
00:13:28.692 --> 00:13:31.895
The whole, it exploded the pharmaceutical industry

347
00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.398
and John Rockefeller died at the age of 94,

348
00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:36.300
never taken a drug into his mouth, only with a

349
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.269
homeopath in attendance.

350
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:39.003
We've had one-

351
00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:40.271
<v Regina>Like the Royal Family.</v>

352
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:41.572
<v ->Yes, it is.</v>

353
00:13:41.572 --> 00:13:43.374
<v Regina>The Royal Family are the same, homeopathics.</v>

354
00:13:43.374 --> 00:13:46.874
<v ->Yeah, but Rockefeller's money started</v>

355
00:13:46.874 --> 00:13:49.848
the industry of the pharmaceutical industry.

356
00:13:49.848 --> 00:13:50.681
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

357
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:53.050
<v ->It's all money and greed.</v>

358
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.451
It's plain and simple.

359
00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:58.389
Cancer is an anaerobic disease, oxygen will kill cancer.

360
00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:00.758
And I've had cases with hyperberic chambers that I've used

361
00:14:00.758 --> 00:14:04.000
on cancer cases, I've done great, but yet the industry

362
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.868
makes a half a trillion dollars a year on cancer alone,

363
00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:09.070
they can't make money on oxygen.

364
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.568
<v Regina>Let's talk about something even simpler,</v>

365
00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:12.970
something that most people encounter.

366
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.038
You get a chest infection,

367
00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:16.840
they say, "here, take this antibiotic,

368
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.980
"it's probably a virus."

369
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.150
What's really going on there?

370
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.988
<v ->Number one, infection is their word.</v>

371
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.689
Infection means the germ caused the disease,

372
00:14:25.689 --> 00:14:26.989
you know, Pasteur.

373
00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:30.737
No, you have a stagnation and a dysbiosis.

374
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.658
If you break the stagnation,

375
00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:35.359
that's the name of the game.

376
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:37.794
Now, depending on the pH of the stagnation,

377
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:41.832
if there's acid, it'll be more acid, the germ will

378
00:14:41.832 --> 00:14:43.734
go more to the viral form.

379
00:14:43.734 --> 00:14:45.969
If the pH is more alkaline, the germ will

380
00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.471
go more into the fungal form.

381
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.475
The germ adapts and changes.

382
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:52.543
<v Regina>Very interesting.</v>

383
00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:53.410
I haven't heard anyone
<v Harvey>It's not the germ.</v>

384
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.812
[Regina] explain it that way.

385
00:14:54.812 --> 00:14:58.214
<v ->In fact, what goes on is,</v>

386
00:14:58.214 --> 00:14:59.416
the first thing that goes on,

387
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:01.886
we're talking about the strep toxin.

388
00:15:01.886 --> 00:15:02.753
Okay, strep toxin.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

389
00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:04.254
<v ->Well, you got strep in your throat,</v>

390
00:15:04.254 --> 00:15:06.656
you've got strep in your throat, I have strep in my throat,

391
00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.059
what's happening to this toxin?

392
00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:10.360
It's named the toxin like it's a poison.

393
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.462
Every day that step is ingesting things

394
00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:14.464
and waste parts are coming out.

395
00:15:14.464 --> 00:15:16.617
Those waste products are helpful to us.

396
00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:19.904
<v Regina>How so?</v>
<v ->They're very important.</v>

397
00:15:19.904 --> 00:15:23.612
Now, as we, there's a stagnation that takes place,

398
00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:24.912
so what does the strep do?

399
00:15:24.912 --> 00:15:27.912
It morphs slightly, it changes its waste product

400
00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:32.112
to bring in fevers, to bring in circulation,

401
00:15:32.112 --> 00:15:34.892
okay, to clean up the stagnation.

402
00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.122
Now you've got somebody giving an antibiotic to ya

403
00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:39.492
and now what goes on, the stagnation, the germs in the

404
00:15:39.492 --> 00:15:42.431
stagnation say "the heck with you," and they slowly become

405
00:15:42.431 --> 00:15:46.897
more fungal aspects and the purpose of the fungal nature

406
00:15:46.897 --> 00:15:50.400
of the germ is to break down and recycle you.

407
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.911
So, it's not an infection, it's a stagnation.

408
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.872
Break the stagnation

409
00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:57.080
and the problem goes away.

410
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.902
It's that simple.

411
00:15:57.902 --> 00:16:00.078
A lot of times I can do it osteopathically,

412
00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:02.447
I can change the pHs with some of our treatments.

413
00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:05.115
There's ways to break the stagnations.

414
00:16:06.984 --> 00:16:08.919
Why they got the chest thing, we can get into

415
00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:11.521
that a little later, but (sighs).

416
00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:13.724
<v Regina>That just seems to be such a common malady.</v>

417
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.693
You know, every cold and flu season, everybody's coughing

418
00:16:16.693 --> 00:16:18.595
and we seem to get the chest thing.

419
00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:20.163
<v ->Well, first of all, you know, we're talking about how</v>

420
00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:21.898
we even predict colds and flues.

421
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.667
You know what a cold and flu is?

422
00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:25.603
The season's change, so do we.

423
00:16:25.603 --> 00:16:28.105
And as the season's change, okay,

424
00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:31.875
if you're toxic, if you're stressed, you will quote

425
00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:33.377
"get a flu."

426
00:16:33.377 --> 00:16:36.920
If you're clean and you're strong, you won't get a flu.

427
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.150
All it is is an adaptation to the change of the season.

428
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.459
It's not a new virus.

429
00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:42.420
(both laugh)

430
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.890
Okay, and it's related so much to what goes on in society,

431
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.630
how virulent the flu is has a lot to do with the emotions

432
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.800
of society, but that's a whole other story, too.

433
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.370
<v Regina>Well, it's one I want to talk about.</v>

434
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.239
<v ->Okay.</v>

435
00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Regina>Um, let's go back for just a moment,</v>

436
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.670
acid versus alkaline.

437
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.469
<v ->Yes.</v>

438
00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:00.309
<v Regina>Um, the whole thing about</v>

439
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:03.180
raising our alkalinity, that's another thing

440
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.880
that's big in the health community.

441
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.850
<v ->Well, there's a confusion on it, okay?</v>

442
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.980
<v Regina>Yes, let's talk about that.</v>

443
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.716
<v ->What happens is, as we go ill more, as we get stressed</v>

444
00:17:12.716 --> 00:17:16.119
adrenaline, starts to fire up,

445
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.888
our cells become acid.

446
00:17:17.888 --> 00:17:21.690
By becoming acid, they dump alkaline waste.

447
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:26.190
The normal pH of the venous blood now is considered 7.4.

448
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.370
That's what I was taught in medical school.

449
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.235
In the 1950 though, it was 7.35,

450
00:17:31.235 --> 00:17:33.337
7.32 to 7.35.

451
00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:35.873
From the pollutions, we're changing.

452
00:17:35.873 --> 00:17:37.575
We're accepting 7.4.

453
00:17:37.575 --> 00:17:39.810
Cancer develops after 7.4.

454
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.978
If you ever get the pH down below 7.35,

455
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.463
cancer can't even live.

456
00:17:44.881 --> 00:17:47.633
Okay, now, stress makes the alkaline blood.

457
00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:53.357
There's ways, the best way to get yourself into

458
00:17:53.357 --> 00:17:56.609
a meditative state and the blood will change its pHs.

459
00:17:57.894 --> 00:17:59.996
The best way to stabilize the pH of the blood,

460
00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.081
more than anything else is joy.

461
00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:05.735
Okay, that almost instantaneously starts

462
00:18:05.735 --> 00:18:07.103
to stabilize the system.

463
00:18:07.103 --> 00:18:08.238
<v Regina>Amazing, yeah.</v>

464
00:18:08.238 --> 00:18:09.773
<v ->Every thought has a reaction.</v>

465
00:18:09.773 --> 00:18:11.808
If you worried, it's gonna be there

466
00:18:11.808 --> 00:18:14.678
and that stress will do things to the blood.

467
00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:16.046
<v Regina>And you can see this</v>

468
00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:18.148
in the blood?
<v ->Oh yes, oh yes.</v>

469
00:18:18.148 --> 00:18:19.482
If you're angry, I can see it in the blood.

470
00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:20.917
If you're angry for a week, it's different.

471
00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:22.720
If you're a genetically angry person,

472
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.989
it's even different still.

473
00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:25.889
It's there.

474
00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:28.425
<v Regina>So which kinds of emotions are you seeing</v>

475
00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:30.827
having the greatest impact?

476
00:18:30.827 --> 00:18:31.962
On the blood.

477
00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:33.430
(both stammer)

478
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.100
Depression, anger, uh, loss, yeah-

479
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.735
<v ->No, it gets more specific than that.</v>

480
00:18:38.735 --> 00:18:41.806
Every single disease has an emotion to it.

481
00:18:41.806 --> 00:18:42.606
<v Regina>Can you talk about it?</v>

482
00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:43.741
Give us a little list?

483
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:44.608
<v ->Yes.</v>

484
00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:47.144
Hamer in Germany came up with the same theories,

485
00:18:47.144 --> 00:18:49.480
which to me is a homeopathic proving of the truth,

486
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.981
which is very, very, very interesting.

487
00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:54.250
And my book will go in and explain how does disease

488
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.353
get from A to Z.

489
00:18:56.353 --> 00:18:57.621
Okay?

490
00:18:59.422 --> 00:19:02.526
We all know that John Wayne had lung cancer.

491
00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:04.595
So did Humphrey Bogart, so did Yul Brynner,

492
00:19:04.595 --> 00:19:07.430
so did Steve McQueen, so did Gary Cooper.

493
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.366
Now, what's the story of them?

494
00:19:09.366 --> 00:19:11.969
The personality sets the pattern.

495
00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:15.105
The lungs are the organ of fear, in acupuncture philosophy

496
00:19:15.105 --> 00:19:17.007
and they clean themselves by crying.

497
00:19:17.007 --> 00:19:19.410
Can you picture any one of these five stars

498
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.344
showing fear or crying?

499
00:19:21.344 --> 00:19:23.714
So instead of showing fear, they'd act like the macho guy

500
00:19:23.714 --> 00:19:25.282
and pick up the cigarette.

501
00:19:25.282 --> 00:19:27.918
It wasn't the cigarette that caused the lung cancer,

502
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:30.387
it was the attitude that craved the cigarette

503
00:19:30.387 --> 00:19:31.721
that caused the lung cancer.

504
00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:33.123
<v Regina>Ahh.</v>

505
00:19:33.123 --> 00:19:35.859
<v ->It's the same personalities.</v>

506
00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:39.663
We all know the ulcer person's wearing a hole in himself.

507
00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:41.365
Every disease.

508
00:19:41.365 --> 00:19:42.732
Left breast cancer's somewhat different

509
00:19:42.732 --> 00:19:44.135
than right breast cancer.

510
00:19:44.135 --> 00:19:47.871
Every single disease has its own personality.

511
00:19:47.871 --> 00:19:50.841
And that personality starts to be reflected,

512
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:54.244
it changes the physical structure.

513
00:19:54.244 --> 00:19:57.648
Okay, if you're angry, you'll walk around (grunts).

514
00:19:57.648 --> 00:20:00.017
That change in the physical structure is causing

515
00:20:00.017 --> 00:20:03.837
stagnations, which are starting to cause things to happen.

516
00:20:05.522 --> 00:20:07.625
<v Regina>What about breast cancer?</v>

517
00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:09.659
What are the emotions that are often linked

518
00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:11.095
to breast cancer and -

519
00:20:11.095 --> 00:20:14.632
<v ->Two major ones: breasts are the organs of nurturing.</v>

520
00:20:14.632 --> 00:20:17.234
Every organ's got a symbol, okay?

521
00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:19.069
The breasts are the organs of nurturing.

522
00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:22.239
Okay, there's a lack of nurturing.

523
00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:24.308
Also, the other aspect,

524
00:20:24.308 --> 00:20:26.076
there's two aspects of breast cancer.

525
00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:28.512
It's the lack of nurturing and the other one is

526
00:20:28.512 --> 00:20:31.147
the male/female territorial problem.

527
00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.316
Who's wearing the pants.

528
00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:32.949
<v Regina>Oh, can you-</v>

529
00:20:32.949 --> 00:20:35.220
<v ->I hate to say it, but the feminists have created</v>

530
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.437
an epidemic of breast cancer.

531
00:20:39.189 --> 00:20:40.357
Men are men and women are women,

532
00:20:40.357 --> 00:20:42.026
there is no equality.

533
00:20:42.026 --> 00:20:45.161
When a woman is, a man is being man, you women,

534
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.464
hit you over the head with a club and drag ya.

535
00:20:47.464 --> 00:20:50.467
Women's strength is her guile and intuition.

536
00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:53.169
If you get in the face of a man, you're gonna lose.

537
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:53.804
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

538
00:20:53.804 --> 00:20:56.205
<v ->When a woman goes out to a man's world,</v>

539
00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:58.809
and acts like a man,

540
00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:01.544
that is affecting things.

541
00:21:01.544 --> 00:21:02.413
Okay?

542
00:21:02.413 --> 00:21:04.581
Women now are working like crazy,

543
00:21:04.581 --> 00:21:07.384
instead of being home raising the kids.

544
00:21:07.384 --> 00:21:09.385
There's a lack of nurturing going on.

545
00:21:09.385 --> 00:21:12.123
There's also who's wearing the pants,

546
00:21:12.123 --> 00:21:13.623
where we are now equal.

547
00:21:13.623 --> 00:21:15.626
I have equal rights and you have equal rights

548
00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:17.494
and the game goes on, okay?

549
00:21:17.494 --> 00:21:21.911
So that confusion has caused breast cancer to rise.

550
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:22.265
<v Regina>Well-</v>

551
00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:23.533
<v ->Plain and simple.</v>

552
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:26.469
<v Regina>As I see it among people that I know,</v>

553
00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:28.338
I see a lot of what you say is true.

554
00:21:28.338 --> 00:21:30.174
There's this conflicted feeling inside.

555
00:21:30.174 --> 00:21:30.940
<v ->Yes.</v>

556
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.044
<v Regina>A lot of conflicted feeling, a definite lack</v>

557
00:21:33.044 --> 00:21:37.348
of nurturing, a lack of love in the environment, often.

558
00:21:37.348 --> 00:21:40.655
<v ->Yes, and the women, frankly, I think a man should</v>

559
00:21:40.655 --> 00:21:43.394
work on five jobs before a woman has to work on one.

560
00:21:43.394 --> 00:21:45.155
That's what the man's job is.

561
00:21:45.155 --> 00:21:45.994
<v Regina>I didn't hear that part, say-</v>

562
00:21:45.994 --> 00:21:48.065
<v ->A man should work on five jobs before a woman</v>

563
00:21:48.065 --> 00:21:50.495
has to work on one.

564
00:21:50.495 --> 00:21:52.395
You can't replace the woman's job, I mean,

565
00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.765
you put a man at home over there and he's a horror show.

566
00:21:54.765 --> 00:21:56.035
We all have our own strengths.

567
00:21:56.035 --> 00:21:58.505
Give a man prelabor pains and he'll blow his brains out.

568
00:21:58.505 --> 00:21:59.605
(both chuckle)

569
00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:01.035
We each have our own strengths.

570
00:22:01.035 --> 00:22:03.414
Not one is better than the other.

571
00:22:03.414 --> 00:22:05.505
So making us the same is crazy.

572
00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:07.315
<v Regina>I've often wondered about that.</v>

573
00:22:07.315 --> 00:22:09.814
If one chooses to incarnate as male, that brings a certain

574
00:22:09.814 --> 00:22:12.754
set of priorities and skills and propensities

575
00:22:12.754 --> 00:22:15.685
and the same thing if one chooses to incarnate as female.

576
00:22:15.685 --> 00:22:18.225
And it seems as though we're actually attempting

577
00:22:18.225 --> 00:22:20.695
to make the experience androgenous now.

578
00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:22.625
<v ->It's totally ridiculous.</v>

579
00:22:24.696 --> 00:22:28.832
The equality of liberalism is so ridiculous at times.

580
00:22:28.832 --> 00:22:31.501
I mean, let's look at the reality of the show.

581
00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:33.940
Okay, what is the reality of it, you know?

582
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.071
That's what it is.

583
00:22:35.071 --> 00:22:37.641
It's not better or worse, it just is.

584
00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:39.610
I tell any women if they're gonna go out and work,

585
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.579
go out dressed like a woman.

586
00:22:42.579 --> 00:22:44.581
Okay, you know, and do that.

587
00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:47.050
You can still do it that way.

588
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.818
Don't go out there like a man and do it,

589
00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:52.190
so these are the confusing attitudes of society.

590
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.523
Know there are two major emotions.

591
00:22:53.523 --> 00:22:56.160
If you track, if you did psychological testing,

592
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.161
you'll track em down and you'll find em pretty darn

593
00:22:58.161 --> 00:23:01.064
accurate on the emotions involved in disease.

594
00:23:01.064 --> 00:23:03.000
<v Regina>Well, yes, very interesting.</v>

595
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.202
I know, is this mentioned in more detail in your book?

596
00:23:05.202 --> 00:23:06.436
Do you go into
<v Harvey>Yes.</v>

597
00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:08.238
[Regina] the descriptions of the various diseases

598
00:23:08.238 --> 00:23:09.305
and emotions underlying?

599
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.842
<v ->Yes, I go into great details on it and explain</v>

600
00:23:11.842 --> 00:23:15.178
how it gets through, how it gets through from the structure,

601
00:23:15.178 --> 00:23:16.813
through the meridians, through the organs

602
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.715
and why it goes to where.

603
00:23:18.715 --> 00:23:20.716
Okay and there is no accident

604
00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:23.653
to why someone's getting a hepatitis C

605
00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:25.021
to someone who's getting an ulcer,

606
00:23:25.021 --> 00:23:26.322
there are no accidents.

607
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.258
If there was an accident in nature, the whole earth

608
00:23:28.258 --> 00:23:30.060
can go off its axis.

609
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.295
There cannot be, okay?

610
00:23:32.295 --> 00:23:35.132
<v Regina>Let's talk about diet and nutrition.</v>

611
00:23:35.132 --> 00:23:37.233
I know you have very different view points.

612
00:23:37.233 --> 00:23:38.968
You've said off camera that you're not particularly

613
00:23:38.968 --> 00:23:41.538
popular with the MDs, but you're also not particularly

614
00:23:41.538 --> 00:23:43.907
popular with the alternative therapists on your

615
00:23:43.907 --> 00:23:45.642
views over diet and nutrition.

616
00:23:45.642 --> 00:23:48.746
Could you go ahead and just explain?

617
00:23:48.746 --> 00:23:51.081
<v ->First of all, I'm a naturalist more than anything else.</v>

618
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:52.583
I learn from nature.

619
00:23:52.583 --> 00:23:54.817
What's going on now, all the processed foods, you know,

620
00:23:54.817 --> 00:23:58.271
the nutrition, the American nutrition is a horror show.

621
00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:00.591
Everything we eat, all the chemicals that we're eating,

622
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.826
the amount of fat people that we have here

623
00:24:02.826 --> 00:24:04.461
and that's from the chemicals that we eat

624
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:06.162
and all the garbage that we're eating and the body's

625
00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:08.598
just bloating up like crazy.

626
00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:11.068
Now, the alternative people are going to the natural stuff.

627
00:24:11.068 --> 00:24:12.269
Let's go vegetarian.

628
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:14.738
Well, we have canine teeth, we're carnivorous beings,

629
00:24:14.738 --> 00:24:16.639
we've centuries eaten meat.

630
00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:18.308
That's what we're about.

631
00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:21.951
You need to eat the meat, the mouth is made to chew.

632
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:24.315
I believe, and a lot of the work, I think Weston Price's

633
00:24:24.315 --> 00:24:28.100
work was probably the greatest nutritional work around.

634
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.454
He spends a chunk of his life going around the world

635
00:24:30.454 --> 00:24:32.589
to find the perfect mouth.

636
00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:35.058
He was a dentist that developed root canals.

637
00:24:35.058 --> 00:24:36.560
After a few years of that he said that root canals

638
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.794
are a horror.

639
00:24:37.794 --> 00:24:40.997
He finds 14 civilizations with perfect mouths.

640
00:24:40.997 --> 00:24:44.268
They're in Georgia in Russia, they're equatorial,

641
00:24:44.268 --> 00:24:46.643
there's nothing in common with them,

642
00:24:46.643 --> 00:24:49.773
except their concepts of how they eat.

643
00:24:49.773 --> 00:24:51.677
70% of the food they eat,

644
00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:55.428
animal meats, animal fats, animal proteins and bones.

645
00:24:56.546 --> 00:24:58.414
<v Regina>Interesting cause this goes counter to</v>

646
00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:01.419
everything that's being said today about going into

647
00:25:01.419 --> 00:25:04.421
more greens and more juices and

648
00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:06.790
essentially more of a plant-based diet.

649
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.592
<v ->Everything is getting PR and propaganda, okay?</v>

650
00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:12.161
I mentioned before the juicing.

651
00:25:12.161 --> 00:25:15.332
I mean, the concept, if god wants you to drink orange

652
00:25:15.332 --> 00:25:17.734
juice, he would have put a tap on the tree.

653
00:25:17.734 --> 00:25:21.038
I mean, no one has 30 oranges in a sitting.

654
00:25:21.038 --> 00:25:22.706
Juicing is a fad.

655
00:25:22.706 --> 00:25:25.709
Eat the whole thing, the pulp is there for a reason.

656
00:25:25.709 --> 00:25:28.044
How many people have 30 carrots in a sitting?

657
00:25:28.044 --> 00:25:28.979
<v Regina>Right.</v>

658
00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:31.515
<v ->Okay, so these concepts,</v>

659
00:25:31.515 --> 00:25:33.786
you know, they're just the same hype

660
00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:35.586
that everyone else gives.

661
00:25:35.586 --> 00:25:37.588
My philosophy is like a bear.

662
00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:39.522
A bear is gonna hibernate for the winter,

663
00:25:39.522 --> 00:25:43.242
eats everything he can, puts all the energies into the fats

664
00:25:44.494 --> 00:25:47.164
and that's where they store the energy.

665
00:25:47.164 --> 00:25:50.934
The human has no enzymes to digest a raw green.

666
00:25:50.934 --> 00:25:52.970
Raw greens have celluloid coats on em.

667
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.203
We do not have cellulase.

668
00:25:54.203 --> 00:25:56.773
The cow has cellulase, can digest the raw green

669
00:25:56.773 --> 00:25:58.408
and if the cow's not using the energy,

670
00:25:58.408 --> 00:26:00.944
put the stores in the fats.

671
00:26:00.944 --> 00:26:02.546
<v Regina>So what if we eat their fat in the form</v>

672
00:26:02.546 --> 00:26:04.480
of butter and so forth?

673
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.082
<v ->That's the best thing to eat.</v>

674
00:26:06.082 --> 00:26:07.050
The organic butters-

675
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.719
<v Regina>You're my hero (laughs).</v>

676
00:26:08.719 --> 00:26:09.886
<v ->Eat the fat.
<v Regina>I love butter.</v>

677
00:26:09.886 --> 00:26:10.854
I love cream.

678
00:26:10.854 --> 00:26:11.654
<v ->I love butter.</v>

679
00:26:11.654 --> 00:26:13.723
Eat the fatty steaks, that's where it's there.

680
00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:15.792
We're taught all of these things, everything

681
00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:17.628
we're taught on fats is wrong.

682
00:26:17.628 --> 00:26:19.698
The cholesterol is a myth.

683
00:26:19.698 --> 00:26:21.798
Right now Lipitor is one of the biggest selling drugs

684
00:26:21.798 --> 00:26:24.368
on the market cause it's all cholesterol.

685
00:26:24.368 --> 00:26:26.838
Number one, cholesterol, normal cholesterol

686
00:26:26.838 --> 00:26:29.848
they say is 180 to 220, almost, most geniuses

687
00:26:29.848 --> 00:26:32.178
run 240 to 300.

688
00:26:32.178 --> 00:26:36.087
Almost every chronic fatigue is under 180 down to 150.

689
00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:38.917
Cholesterol is made by our adrenal glands.

690
00:26:38.917 --> 00:26:40.918
It's our body's own steroid.

691
00:26:40.918 --> 00:26:43.327
You take the adrenal, that out of the adrenal glands

692
00:26:43.327 --> 00:26:45.328
over there and suppress that and you have

693
00:26:45.328 --> 00:26:46.928
no get-up-and-go.

694
00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:49.738
Cholesterol's very important.

695
00:26:49.738 --> 00:26:51.961
As we get old and the internal linings of the blood vessels

696
00:26:51.961 --> 00:26:54.631
crack and cholesterol's just the body's putty.

697
00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:57.268
If you could make the internal lining soft,

698
00:26:57.268 --> 00:27:00.236
you could have 1,000 cholesterol and it makes no difference,

699
00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:03.486
so that's their story, okay?

700
00:27:03.486 --> 00:27:05.809
My good friend, the late Bob Atkins, he was right

701
00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:08.210
on the money, okay?

702
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.614
It's the high protein and the bones.

703
00:27:10.614 --> 00:27:12.482
The bone combinations, there's ways to actually

704
00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:14.751
gelatinize the bones, you can leech the bones,

705
00:27:14.751 --> 00:27:16.820
it's the perfect mineral combination there is.

706
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.020
You wanna, instead of going to a store

707
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.760
and buying minerals, the bones.

708
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.799
<v Regina>How does that go?</v>

709
00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:25.028
<v ->The bones of the animal are the same material</v>

710
00:27:25.028 --> 00:27:26.267
as the bones of you.

711
00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:27.290
<v Regina>Yeah, right, but I mean, how</v>

712
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.370
<v ->Make a soup.
<v Regina>do you consume them</v>

713
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.870
oh you're saying using them in soups,

714
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.769
like the marrow
<v ->In soups, and there are</v>

715
00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:33.240
ways that you can look up recipes.

716
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.772
There's Weston Price has got something

717
00:27:35.772 --> 00:27:39.271
nourishing traditionally took ways to gelatinize the bones.

718
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:41.477
There's ways that you can gelatinize and use them

719
00:27:41.477 --> 00:27:45.716
as spreads, but basically, eat it the way the animal has it

720
00:27:45.716 --> 00:27:47.757
and it's so much better.

721
00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:49.325
<v Regina>I know the French are really big on that.</v>

722
00:27:49.325 --> 00:27:52.395
They're much more understanding of the various aspects

723
00:27:52.395 --> 00:27:56.897
or portions of the animal that can be utilized.

724
00:27:56.897 --> 00:27:59.657
<v ->First of all, if a wolf pack catches an antelope,</v>

725
00:27:59.657 --> 00:28:01.727
the first one there gets the adrenal glands.

726
00:28:01.727 --> 00:28:02.967
The next bunch get the organs,

727
00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:04.906
only the weakest get the meat.

728
00:28:04.906 --> 00:28:07.607
The organs really, this is a concept, you eat the

729
00:28:07.607 --> 00:28:09.505
adrenal glands, that's gonna strengthen your adrenals.

730
00:28:09.505 --> 00:28:13.015
Do you remember the movie Dances With Wolves?

731
00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:13.717
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

732
00:28:13.717 --> 00:28:15.585
<v ->He goes on a buffalo hunt over there and they give</v>

733
00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:17.085
him a testicle to eat because they've got

734
00:28:17.085 --> 00:28:18.886
a virility dance that night.

735
00:28:18.886 --> 00:28:20.857
It's a like treats like.

736
00:28:20.857 --> 00:28:23.287
But the animals,

737
00:28:23.287 --> 00:28:26.387
oh, going back to the nutrition aspect,

738
00:28:26.387 --> 00:28:29.326
I think everything, with just the propaganda for both sides

739
00:28:29.326 --> 00:28:31.294
is absolutely horrendous and again, you look at

740
00:28:31.294 --> 00:28:33.329
the French, we talked about before,

741
00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:36.499
5,000 calories at dinner, they're thin as rails

742
00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:38.468
cause they do it over two to three hours.

743
00:28:38.468 --> 00:28:40.437
It's a social experience.

744
00:28:40.437 --> 00:28:42.540
We inhale our food.

745
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.274
Big difference.

746
00:28:44.274 --> 00:28:45.741
Okay?

747
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:48.044
We should chew our food up to 40 times,

748
00:28:48.044 --> 00:28:49.879
the teeth are made to grind back here,

749
00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:52.817
if you're just eating what I call foo-foo food,

750
00:28:52.817 --> 00:28:54.317
you're mouth's gonna rot because

751
00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:55.985
you're not even exercising it.

752
00:28:55.985 --> 00:28:58.288
<v Regina>Well, that makes sense and also for the enzymes,</v>

753
00:28:58.288 --> 00:28:58.956
<v ->Everything.</v>

754
00:28:58.956 --> 00:29:00.023
<v Regina>that kick in, yeah.</v>

755
00:29:00.023 --> 00:29:01.458
<v ->You start, digestion starts in the mouth,</v>

756
00:29:01.458 --> 00:29:02.692
you chew it.

757
00:29:02.692 --> 00:29:04.761
And also the intestines work by this,

758
00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:06.329
they work all like this and if you're gonna

759
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:09.466
give it liquids, the intestines are gonna get floppy.

760
00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:11.300
They like to work.

761
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.603
<v Regina>So how much of a problem are we creating</v>

762
00:29:13.603 --> 00:29:18.074
for ourselves by being essentially in such a hurry,

763
00:29:18.074 --> 00:29:20.217
where we just throw our food down,

764
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.979
have a mocha or a protein drink in the morning,

765
00:29:22.979 --> 00:29:25.386
jam through a fast-food lunch,

766
00:29:25.386 --> 00:29:26.887
what are we doing to ourselves?

767
00:29:26.887 --> 00:29:29.557
<v ->Oh, humans, I personally think god gave humans</v>

768
00:29:29.557 --> 00:29:31.926
free will because he's got a sense of humor.

769
00:29:31.926 --> 00:29:32.917
(Regina laughs)

770
00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:35.225
Humans are the only people that do, only creatures

771
00:29:35.225 --> 00:29:37.966
on the planet that do stupid things like that.

772
00:29:37.966 --> 00:29:39.229
We're the only ones on the planet that have

773
00:29:39.229 --> 00:29:40.162
a well-rounded meal.

774
00:29:40.162 --> 00:29:42.466
You think a deer eats from this leaf and that clover

775
00:29:42.466 --> 00:29:44.267
and that tree? (both laugh)

776
00:29:44.267 --> 00:29:46.202
Okay, everything's digested differently.

777
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:48.938
It's all, we eat when we're supposed to eat,

778
00:29:48.938 --> 00:29:51.574
okay now it's all clockwork.

779
00:29:51.574 --> 00:29:54.678
We live life what I call ass-backwards.

780
00:29:54.678 --> 00:29:56.280
Okay, and it's all programmed.

781
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.182
We live it according to the way TV tells us to live it

782
00:29:59.182 --> 00:30:01.485
and we're missing the show.

783
00:30:01.485 --> 00:30:03.619
Especially in the United States.

784
00:30:03.619 --> 00:30:06.924
<v Regina>So at what point can we say it's best for us</v>

785
00:30:06.924 --> 00:30:10.260
to, I mean, I assume all the time, to go by intuition

786
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.696
in terms of what our body is craving that day,

787
00:30:12.696 --> 00:30:15.264
where do we start picking up our natural intuition,

788
00:30:15.264 --> 00:30:18.568
versus our programmed cravings now?

789
00:30:18.568 --> 00:30:21.337
<v ->Oh, you know, I tell people just simple, little things</v>

790
00:30:21.337 --> 00:30:22.977
if you listen to yourself.

791
00:30:22.977 --> 00:30:24.546
You're gonna reach for the chocolate and you're gonna say,

792
00:30:24.546 --> 00:30:25.642
you know, "I want the chocolate."

793
00:30:25.642 --> 00:30:27.878
Ask yourself the question, "should I eat that?"

794
00:30:27.878 --> 00:30:30.213
And the answer will come so quickly you won't believe it.

795
00:30:30.213 --> 00:30:32.381
Most people reject the answer (laughs).

796
00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:35.052
Okay, but if you follow what your cravings are

797
00:30:35.052 --> 00:30:37.503
and then you ask it, you'll know the answers.

798
00:30:39.156 --> 00:30:40.823
I'm simplistic.

799
00:30:40.823 --> 00:30:44.661
You eat, Eskimos eat blubber because they need the fat,

800
00:30:44.661 --> 00:30:47.197
that's why it's there, they're living in the cold.

801
00:30:47.197 --> 00:30:49.399
In southern California, a lot of citrus is grown

802
00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:51.902
because that's what necessary, you eat what the land

803
00:30:51.902 --> 00:30:54.904
prepares for you at the time of the year the land

804
00:30:54.904 --> 00:30:57.341
prepares for you, okay?

805
00:30:57.341 --> 00:30:59.976
That's basically what you eat and you eat the animals,

806
00:30:59.976 --> 00:31:01.827
you eat free-range.

807
00:31:04.415 --> 00:31:05.048
You know, fatty-

808
00:31:05.048 --> 00:31:06.383
<v Regina>What about dairy?</v>

809
00:31:06.383 --> 00:31:10.086
<v ->Dairy, I go into unpasteurized stuff if you can get it,</v>

810
00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:12.855
raw milk, raw butter, but the human, again,

811
00:31:12.855 --> 00:31:15.157
is the only creature still has milk after we're weened.

812
00:31:15.157 --> 00:31:17.426
We're weened about the age of 25.

813
00:31:17.426 --> 00:31:19.763
So butter's, you know, milk products are not necessary,

814
00:31:19.763 --> 00:31:21.063
we don't do as well with it.

815
00:31:21.063 --> 00:31:22.599
<v Regina>A lot of people are, yeah,</v>

816
00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:24.701
they're lactose intolerants, but that's not

817
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:27.036
necessarily true in the fat.

818
00:31:27.036 --> 00:31:28.938
The fat doesn't bring about the same reaction

819
00:31:28.938 --> 00:31:30.940
as the actual milk, right?

820
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.309
<v ->Well, you know, first of all, cow's milk and human milk</v>

821
00:31:33.309 --> 00:31:34.476
are two different things.

822
00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.412
Goat's milk you're not gonna find this quote

823
00:31:36.412 --> 00:31:39.615
"lactose intolerance," that's just a name again.

824
00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:44.020
Lactose intolerance comes from as the tissue swells

825
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.089
and because it swells in our intestines,

826
00:31:46.089 --> 00:31:47.957
from stress or multiple different things,

827
00:31:47.957 --> 00:31:50.026
you quote "become lactose intolerant."

828
00:31:50.026 --> 00:31:51.895
You can tighten up mucosas too, you have no

829
00:31:51.895 --> 00:31:53.696
problem with that at all.

830
00:31:53.696 --> 00:31:55.900
These are names that are given to things.

831
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.101
I am "lactose intolerant."

832
00:31:58.101 --> 00:32:01.204
You know, I have this and it labels you.

833
00:32:01.204 --> 00:32:02.939
No, that's all.

834
00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:06.810
There's no animal on the planet that's allergic.

835
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.177
There's no animal on the planet that's got

836
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:09.580
an autoimmune disease.

837
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.914
You think the creator made body, you allergic

838
00:32:11.914 --> 00:32:13.817
to your own body?

839
00:32:13.817 --> 00:32:15.818
These are names that have been given

840
00:32:15.818 --> 00:32:16.953
and that people are brainwashed,

841
00:32:16.953 --> 00:32:18.321
they don't even know how to talk

842
00:32:18.321 --> 00:32:20.324
the right conversation anymore.

843
00:32:20.324 --> 00:32:22.693
<v Regina>Yeah, well I, here, here.</v>

844
00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:25.295
I would like to get on to looking at some of your slides.

845
00:32:25.295 --> 00:32:25.895
<v ->Okay.</v>

846
00:32:25.895 --> 00:32:27.664
<v Regina>This is fascinating work you're doing</v>

847
00:32:27.664 --> 00:32:29.766
and do you wanna go ahead and just take a minute

848
00:32:29.766 --> 00:32:31.935
to set up and find a slide or two that

849
00:32:31.935 --> 00:32:33.903
we'll find quite fascinating here?

850
00:32:33.903 --> 00:32:35.772
<v ->Yep, I'm gonna show you some pictures here,</v>

851
00:32:35.772 --> 00:32:36.473
lemme get this...

852
00:32:36.473 --> 00:32:37.173
<v Regina>So...</v>

853
00:32:37.173 --> 00:32:39.108
<v ->It was about 20 years ago that I started</v>

854
00:32:39.108 --> 00:32:39.975
to look at the blood.

855
00:32:39.975 --> 00:32:44.113
I visited a physicist outside of Montreal, Gaston Naessens,

856
00:32:44.113 --> 00:32:47.283
who had a microscope that magnified up to 60 thousand times.

857
00:32:47.283 --> 00:32:49.153
Once I looked into his microscope and saw things

858
00:32:49.153 --> 00:32:51.487
moving around, my life changed.

859
00:32:51.487 --> 00:32:54.758
No one had ever shown me live blood before.

860
00:32:54.758 --> 00:32:57.192
I had two different German teachers worked with me

861
00:32:57.192 --> 00:32:59.329
side-by-side to show me different things.

862
00:32:59.329 --> 00:33:02.231
In the United States, there are 96 medical schools

863
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:04.234
in the United States, they stain the blood.

864
00:33:04.234 --> 00:33:06.869
The stain fixed it for mortality.

865
00:33:06.869 --> 00:33:09.440
You never see the blood, and it kills it, it's a poison.

866
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.074
You never see the blood live, you never see how

867
00:33:11.074 --> 00:33:12.642
it deteriorates and if it's not stainable,

868
00:33:12.642 --> 00:33:14.511
it's invisible on an artifact.

869
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:16.512
There are things in the human blood

870
00:33:16.512 --> 00:33:20.517
that have absolutely no name for it in American literature.

871
00:33:20.517 --> 00:33:21.954
Plus, there are a lot of things in the blood

872
00:33:21.954 --> 00:33:23.984
they've called artifacts.

873
00:33:23.984 --> 00:33:26.094
There's a concept they see in the blood that Germans have

874
00:33:26.094 --> 00:33:28.564
seen now for a century, of debris in the blood

875
00:33:28.564 --> 00:33:30.364
they call symplasts.

876
00:33:30.364 --> 00:33:32.634
And the first teacher I saw in the United States

877
00:33:32.634 --> 00:33:36.104
came over from Sweden in the early 1990s

878
00:33:36.104 --> 00:33:39.304
and he started talking about these artifacts in the blood

879
00:33:39.304 --> 00:33:41.004
and I turned around to a friend next to me and I said,

880
00:33:41.004 --> 00:33:42.674
"you know, I've been studying those artifacts

881
00:33:42.674 --> 00:33:44.944
"for five years."

882
00:33:44.944 --> 00:33:47.174
I wanna show you some pictures that I've seen in the blood

883
00:33:47.174 --> 00:33:48.944
to show you...

884
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:50.884
<v Regina>Now I wanna know what an artifact in the blood is</v>

885
00:33:50.884 --> 00:33:52.114
and what this means.

886
00:33:52.114 --> 00:33:53.954
<v ->There's a lot of debris in the blood.</v>

887
00:33:53.954 --> 00:33:57.670
Okay and they say it's on the slide and they push it off and

888
00:33:58.955 --> 00:34:00.789
people are looking at what I, they're looking at

889
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:02.625
the leaves and they're missing the forest

890
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:04.560
when they look at the blood.

891
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.729
They're pieces of debris and I'll give you an example.

892
00:34:06.729 --> 00:34:09.165
This was a piece of debris.

893
00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:11.983
Here's a red blood cell, if you can see that one.

894
00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.240
I take capillary blood out of a finger.

895
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.408
Only one red cell can come through a capillary at a time

896
00:34:17.408 --> 00:34:20.276
and yet, you've got pictures like this in the blood.

897
00:34:20.276 --> 00:34:22.512
This was someone, and to show people that these

898
00:34:22.512 --> 00:34:25.715
are not crazy and that a lot of these things are,

899
00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:28.985
really look weird, a lot of them are very accurate.

900
00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:31.788
This is a tooth implant on someone that had to come out,

901
00:34:31.788 --> 00:34:33.156
there was a problem.

902
00:34:33.156 --> 00:34:35.791
This is a picture of it in the blood.

903
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:37.093
<v Regina>Interesting, now how-</v>

904
00:34:37.093 --> 00:34:38.594
<v Harvey>Okay, now look at the accuracy.</v>

905
00:34:38.594 --> 00:34:40.030
There's the butt on that, look at the butt on that.

906
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.964
There are the threads on that.

907
00:34:41.964 --> 00:34:42.732
How did that get

908
00:34:42.732 --> 00:34:43.465
into the blood?
<v Regina>Yeah, the threads,</v>

909
00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:44.400
the tooth on the top.

910
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.702
How did that get in the blood?

911
00:34:45.702 --> 00:34:47.570
<v ->Well, it's taken me about 10 years to try to</v>

912
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.772
figure that one out and another 10 years to try to

913
00:34:49.772 --> 00:34:52.675
explain it in my newest book (laughs), okay?

914
00:34:52.675 --> 00:34:54.077
It's not an easy concept.

915
00:34:54.077 --> 00:34:55.878
<v Regina>What is it?</v>

916
00:34:55.878 --> 00:34:57.513
<v Harvey>Well, let's go further on that one.</v>

917
00:34:57.513 --> 00:35:00.716
That's one picture, let's show you another picture.

918
00:35:00.716 --> 00:35:03.753
This is a picture, this gal came to me,

919
00:35:03.753 --> 00:35:06.055
she was 10 weeks pregnant.

920
00:35:06.055 --> 00:35:07.390
In the blood.

921
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.592
There is a picture of the fetus.

922
00:35:09.592 --> 00:35:10.993
That is the umbilical cord,

923
00:35:10.993 --> 00:35:14.902
that's the placenta and that's in the uterus.

924
00:35:14.902 --> 00:35:17.033
<v Regina>And that's showing up wh-</v>

925
00:35:17.033 --> 00:35:18.133
<v Harvey>In a drop of blood.</v>

926
00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:19.485
Let's go further, okay?

927
00:35:20.972 --> 00:35:22.722
That's where you do it over here.

928
00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:26.960
Let's go here, in the same drop of blood.

929
00:35:28.244 --> 00:35:30.647
There's the placenta, there's the cord,

930
00:35:30.647 --> 00:35:33.795
that's the baby in the uterus.

931
00:35:33.795 --> 00:35:34.583
Okay?

932
00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:35.786
<v Regina>And that's in, that is-</v>

933
00:35:35.786 --> 00:35:37.487
<v Harvey>One drop of blood.</v>

934
00:35:37.487 --> 00:35:38.921
This is actually another shot,

935
00:35:38.921 --> 00:35:41.624
this is from the placenta and there's the same shape

936
00:35:41.624 --> 00:35:43.626
coming off of there.

937
00:35:43.626 --> 00:35:45.628
<v Regina>The same shape in multiple drops of blood?</v>

938
00:35:45.628 --> 00:35:48.096
<v Harvey>Right, in one drop.</v>

939
00:35:48.096 --> 00:35:49.265
This was all in one drop.

940
00:35:49.265 --> 00:35:50.166
<v Regina>Oh, on one drop.</v>

941
00:35:50.166 --> 00:35:51.668
<v Harvey>The uterus is a pear-shaped organ.</v>

942
00:35:51.668 --> 00:35:55.871
There is the fetus, there is the placenta in the uterus.

943
00:35:55.871 --> 00:35:57.711
In the blood.

944
00:35:57.711 --> 00:36:00.981
<v Regina>Now, you wrote a book called Holographic Blood.</v>

945
00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:02.979
What are we looking at here?

946
00:36:02.979 --> 00:36:05.681
<v ->Well, this is, first of all, the book, who's title will</v>

947
00:36:05.681 --> 00:36:07.411
be changed to Blood Mysteries.

948
00:36:07.411 --> 00:36:08.951
<v Regina>Right, the old title.</v>

949
00:36:08.951 --> 00:36:12.391
<v ->Edgar Cayce, America's most prolific psychic stated,</v>

950
00:36:12.391 --> 00:36:14.631
"the physician of the future from one drop of blood

951
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:17.743
"will diagnose the condition of the entire physical body."

952
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:22.098
There is a hologram in the pupil of the eye, in the iris.

953
00:36:22.098 --> 00:36:24.666
There's one in the ear, there's one in the tongue,

954
00:36:24.666 --> 00:36:26.602
there's one in the palm, there's one in the foot,

955
00:36:26.602 --> 00:36:28.738
the Chinese have known this for centuries.

956
00:36:28.738 --> 00:36:30.973
Well, there's one in the blood, too.

957
00:36:30.973 --> 00:36:32.641
Of course there's one in the blood.

958
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:33.909
The blood is very dynamic.

959
00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:35.978
It's not only in the blood, but you can visualize

960
00:36:35.978 --> 00:36:37.629
all of these things that are there.

961
00:36:39.014 --> 00:36:41.384
<v Regina>So what (stammers),</v>

962
00:36:41.384 --> 00:36:45.188
okay, what is the emanation that's showing itself

963
00:36:45.188 --> 00:36:47.157
as this image?

964
00:36:47.157 --> 00:36:48.708
Is this, what is it?

965
00:36:49.993 --> 00:36:51.794
Is it energetic? Is it holographic-

966
00:36:51.794 --> 00:36:54.897
<v ->Yes, Bjorn Nordenstrom, in Sweden,</v>

967
00:36:54.897 --> 00:36:57.567
basically, Bjorn Nordenstrom, in Sweden,

968
00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:00.303
about a couple decades ago,

969
00:37:00.303 --> 00:37:03.405
actually picked up the electrical body of man.

970
00:37:03.405 --> 00:37:05.842
There is, each cell is differently charged.

971
00:37:05.842 --> 00:37:08.678
The blood is like an electrical cable.

972
00:37:08.678 --> 00:37:12.148
They run, the different cells will run in different layers.

973
00:37:12.148 --> 00:37:15.650
In nature, energy's just the pattern for physical.

974
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.920
Electricity sets the pattern for the physical.

975
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.722
If I have a magnet and I put iron filings on it,

976
00:37:19.722 --> 00:37:20.723
it will set a pattern.

977
00:37:20.723 --> 00:37:23.426
If I put stones on it, nothing will happen.

978
00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:25.961
Well, the liver's got an electrical pattern.

979
00:37:25.961 --> 00:37:28.031
Every organ's got an electrical pattern.

980
00:37:28.031 --> 00:37:31.768
In acupuncture philosophy, every organ's got an emotion.

981
00:37:31.768 --> 00:37:34.169
If you're angry, it's the liver.

982
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:37.807
If you're an angry person, the electrical pattern

983
00:37:37.807 --> 00:37:41.311
of the liver will be in the cable and as it precipitates out

984
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:44.014
it will form a shape of a liver.

985
00:37:44.014 --> 00:37:46.081
That is about the best, these things that there are

986
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:49.585
pictures of things that are impossible to be in the blood,

987
00:37:49.585 --> 00:37:51.855
but yet I'll show you the pictures of them.

988
00:37:51.855 --> 00:37:52.822
How did they get there?

989
00:37:52.822 --> 00:37:55.157
I don't believe they're there as much as they precipitate

990
00:37:55.157 --> 00:37:57.960
out when it comes on the slide.

991
00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.994
<v Regina>More energetically?</v>

992
00:37:58.994 --> 00:38:00.363
<v ->Yes, the energy's there.</v>

993
00:38:00.363 --> 00:38:01.998
<v Regina>Like an electrical emanation almost.</v>

994
00:38:01.998 --> 00:38:03.599
<v ->Right, that's exactly right.</v>

995
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:05.135
<v Regina>Would you show us some more?</v>

996
00:38:05.135 --> 00:38:06.236
This is fascinating.

997
00:38:06.236 --> 00:38:06.986
<v ->Okay.</v>

998
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:09.121
This was...

999
00:38:10.873 --> 00:38:13.910
my secretary when she was six weeks pregnant

1000
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.578
and this is the sonogram.

1001
00:38:15.578 --> 00:38:18.882
That is the fetus in the blood, matching the sonogram.

1002
00:38:18.882 --> 00:38:20.883
<v Regina>Huh, that's pretty obvious.</v>

1003
00:38:20.883 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Harvey>Okay?</v>

1004
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.553
This is her three months pregnant.

1005
00:38:24.553 --> 00:38:26.956
There's the head, the neck, there's the arms,

1006
00:38:26.956 --> 00:38:29.541
that's the low back, that's the butt and there are the legs.

1007
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.129
This is six months pregnant, you've actually got eyes

1008
00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:35.531
on there, there's a nose on there and it's a boy,

1009
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:36.966
there's a penis.

1010
00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

1011
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.450
<v Harvey>In there.</v>

1012
00:38:39.902 --> 00:38:42.872
Let's go further, let's go back on a couple things.

1013
00:38:42.872 --> 00:38:44.390
(mouse clicking)

1014
00:38:45.607 --> 00:38:48.143
That was her having her period.

1015
00:38:48.143 --> 00:38:50.246
Right in the blood.
<v Regina>Wow, wow.</v>

1016
00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:51.814
<v Harvey>This one is very interesting.</v>

1017
00:38:51.814 --> 00:38:54.316
See this picture, this is a worm.

1018
00:38:54.316 --> 00:38:58.020
This is a picture of a tapeworm.

1019
00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:02.426
Tapeworms are normally 100 to 200 centimeters in size.

1020
00:39:02.426 --> 00:39:03.696
How did this get in the blood?

1021
00:39:03.696 --> 00:39:05.128
In fact, here's a picture of the tapeworm,

1022
00:39:05.128 --> 00:39:07.930
look at the segments.

1023
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.932
In the blood, in the blood.

1024
00:39:09.932 --> 00:39:11.100
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

1025
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.968
<v Harvey>Okay, here's another one,</v>

1026
00:39:12.968 --> 00:39:15.404
this is a roundworm.

1027
00:39:15.404 --> 00:39:16.939
And I'll show you a picture of that any time.

1028
00:39:16.939 --> 00:39:18.373
How did the roundworm get in the blood?

1029
00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:19.341
Look at the size of that.

1030
00:39:19.341 --> 00:39:20.142
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:39:20.142 --> 00:39:21.376
<v Harvey>And if I show the exact pictures,</v>

1032
00:39:21.376 --> 00:39:22.845
it looks exactly like a worm.

1033
00:39:22.845 --> 00:39:23.913
It couldn't physically be there.

1034
00:39:23.913 --> 00:39:25.047
<v Regina>No.</v>

1035
00:39:25.047 --> 00:39:27.783
<v Harvey>But it's meaning something.</v>

1036
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:29.017
It's meaning something.

1037
00:39:29.017 --> 00:39:33.221
<v Regina>Now, even really more outrageous</v>

1038
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:37.526
than this is that you have seen things in the blood,

1039
00:39:37.526 --> 00:39:40.913
or in imagery, before they've occurred?

1040
00:39:41.997 --> 00:39:44.099
<v ->Well, the most amazing picture, that's the one</v>

1041
00:39:44.099 --> 00:39:45.067
you're referring to.

1042
00:39:45.067 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.969
<v Harvey>Let me see if I can go way back on that one.</v>

1044
00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:47.670
<v Regina>Yeah, that's pretty shocking.</v>

1045
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.271
<v Harvey>Let's see if I can get back on that.</v>

1046
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:53.176
<v Regina>So this is the picture we're mentioning.</v>

1047
00:39:53.176 --> 00:39:54.983
Can you explain what's going on here?

1048
00:39:54.983 --> 00:39:56.683
<v Harvey>This is the single-most exciting picture</v>

1049
00:39:56.683 --> 00:39:58.284
I've ever taken.

1050
00:39:58.284 --> 00:40:02.024
Okay, this is a picture of a leg bone, called a femur.

1051
00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:05.021
Okay, this is a picture of it in Grey's Anatomy.

1052
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:07.724
Okay, you can see the similarity and the accuracy of it.

1053
00:40:07.724 --> 00:40:08.591
This is two,

1054
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:09.759
you know I'm accurate.
<v Regina>Identical.</v>

1055
00:40:09.759 --> 00:40:11.227
<v Harvey>Plus, this has got a crack in it.</v>

1056
00:40:11.227 --> 00:40:12.095
See it broken?

1057
00:40:12.095 --> 00:40:12.995
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1058
00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:15.097
<v Harvey>This came from a patient of mine who sent me</v>

1059
00:40:15.097 --> 00:40:16.900
a slide in the mail, which I can do that,

1060
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.667
they sent FedEx it to me

1061
00:40:18.667 --> 00:40:21.771
and I looked at the slide and I called her up and I said,

1062
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:24.406
"Maureen, did you ever break your leg, or your arm,

1063
00:40:24.406 --> 00:40:25.407
"or anything like that?"

1064
00:40:25.407 --> 00:40:27.409
"No, no, nope."

1065
00:40:27.409 --> 00:40:28.944
But a month later her son calls up,

1066
00:40:28.944 --> 00:40:32.314
"my mom just fell on the ice, guess what just happened?"

1067
00:40:32.314 --> 00:40:33.616
<v Regina>Huh.</v>

1068
00:40:33.616 --> 00:40:36.686
<v Harvey>That picture was taken one month</v>

1069
00:40:36.686 --> 00:40:39.456
before the injury.

1070
00:40:39.456 --> 00:40:41.123
<v Regina>Now, the implications here are huge,</v>

1071
00:40:41.123 --> 00:40:42.558
can you talk about this?

1072
00:40:42.558 --> 00:40:43.893
<v Harvey>(laughs) The only-</v>

1073
00:40:43.893 --> 00:40:45.461
<v Regina>As best you can.</v>

1074
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:47.496
I mean, this is where, I like the new title,

1075
00:40:47.496 --> 00:40:49.933
Blood Mysteries: Myth, Magic or Reality.

1076
00:40:49.933 --> 00:40:51.500
What the heck is this about?

1077
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.370
<v ->This is the most exciting picture I've ever taken,</v>

1078
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:58.541
because it tells you that thought is everything.

1079
00:40:58.541 --> 00:40:59.542
Thought is real.

1080
00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:00.809
<v Regina>Might she have been afraid of falling</v>

1081
00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:02.077
on the ice or something?

1082
00:41:02.077 --> 00:41:04.613
<v ->What she wanted, no, it wasn't.</v>

1083
00:41:04.613 --> 00:41:08.650
She was close to 80 years old, okay?

1084
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.253
And we talked about different things, like example,

1085
00:41:11.253 --> 00:41:14.123
she actually talked about stem cells for her.

1086
00:41:14.123 --> 00:41:16.859
She didn't want that because she was happy

1087
00:41:16.859 --> 00:41:19.011
that everyone was taking care of her.

1088
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.863
Okay?

1089
00:41:21.863 --> 00:41:24.700
Plain and simple, that if she was on her own

1090
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.802
and she was strong, all the people wouldn't

1091
00:41:26.802 --> 00:41:28.070
be taking care of her.

1092
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.872
She would have sons come over, people would come over,

1093
00:41:29.872 --> 00:41:31.374
everyone would help her.

1094
00:41:31.374 --> 00:41:32.741
<v Regina>Well, broken leg'll do it.</v>

1095
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:33.776
<v ->Right.</v>

1096
00:41:33.776 --> 00:41:35.226
She didn't want

1097
00:41:37.113 --> 00:41:39.082
to go the way of getting stem cells

1098
00:41:39.082 --> 00:41:41.350
and getting regenerated cause she was happy

1099
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.386
with everyone taking care of her.

1100
00:41:43.386 --> 00:41:44.286
<v Regina>Oooh.</v>

1101
00:41:44.286 --> 00:41:46.255
<v ->So the thought was, "no, I'm not going that way,</v>

1102
00:41:46.255 --> 00:41:49.558
"this is fine," and then she breaks the leg.

1103
00:41:49.558 --> 00:41:51.960
Aunt Mary has got cancer.

1104
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.264
Why, because everyone visits Aunt Mary.

1105
00:41:55.264 --> 00:41:58.267
Otherwise, no one paid attention to Aunt Mary.

1106
00:41:58.267 --> 00:42:00.402
My first cancer case I got into remission,

1107
00:42:00.402 --> 00:42:02.572
she was 10 years on and off with the disease,

1108
00:42:02.572 --> 00:42:04.608
we called her up and said, "everything's clean."

1109
00:42:04.608 --> 00:42:06.241
And she came in, she looked at me and says,

1110
00:42:06.241 --> 00:42:08.677
"Dr. Bigelsen, now what do I do?"

1111
00:42:08.677 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Regina>Hmmm.</v>

1112
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.882
<v ->Her whole life was cancer, so.</v>

1113
00:42:12.882 --> 00:42:13.715
This was interesting.

1114
00:42:13.715 --> 00:42:14.850
Why this happened?

1115
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.519
That was my thought of why this happened to this gal

1116
00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:19.054
is basically, no, she didn't want

1117
00:42:19.054 --> 00:42:19.955
to get better.
<v Regina>A belief system</v>

1118
00:42:19.955 --> 00:42:22.658
that to be infirmed means you're connected with others and

1119
00:42:22.658 --> 00:42:24.994
they care for you.
<v Harvey>Whatever it is, yes</v>

1120
00:42:24.994 --> 00:42:28.163
There's a secondary gain to most illness.

1121
00:42:28.163 --> 00:42:31.466
<v Regina>Yes, I think that pretty much</v>

1122
00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:33.036
explains it right there.

1123
00:42:33.036 --> 00:42:35.338
<v ->That was it and the picture's so accurate,</v>

1124
00:42:35.338 --> 00:42:37.406
you can't, you know, how did that get there.

1125
00:42:37.406 --> 00:42:39.442
And again, only one red cell can come through the capillary

1126
00:42:39.442 --> 00:42:40.842
at a time, that's the size of a red cell,

1127
00:42:40.842 --> 00:42:42.578
how did that get in there?

1128
00:42:42.578 --> 00:42:44.380
And the beauty and the perfection of that picture.

1129
00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.982
<v Regina>That is an amazing slide.</v>

1130
00:42:46.982 --> 00:42:49.585
Can we talk about some of the mysteries a bit?

1131
00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:50.186
<v ->Sure.</v>

1132
00:42:50.186 --> 00:42:53.872
<v Regina>Historically, the blood is life.</v>

1133
00:42:55.257 --> 00:42:58.527
Can you talk about any of the, whether it's Shamanic

1134
00:42:58.527 --> 00:43:01.530
traditions or the Egyptians and embalming and,

1135
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.333
or whatever you choose, a little bit about the mystery

1136
00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:07.135
of blood from the past, myths and mysteries-

1137
00:43:07.135 --> 00:43:08.971
<v ->It's always been sacred.</v>

1138
00:43:08.971 --> 00:43:11.373
I'm Jewish and Jewish and Kabbalistic Mysticism,

1139
00:43:11.373 --> 00:43:14.042
the soul is in the blood, the spirit's in the blood.

1140
00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:15.845
That's part of the reasons the Kosher food

1141
00:43:15.845 --> 00:43:19.048
is done certain ways, they drain the blood.

1142
00:43:19.048 --> 00:43:23.452
All the life is in the blood, almost in every religion

1143
00:43:23.452 --> 00:43:26.363
since time immemorial that there's been

1144
00:43:26.363 --> 00:43:29.162
a sacredness in the blood.

1145
00:43:29.162 --> 00:43:31.727
That's about the simplest answer I can give to you.

1146
00:43:31.727 --> 00:43:35.465
(stammers) In Judaism, for example,

1147
00:43:35.465 --> 00:43:36.665
and again, and a lot of,

1148
00:43:36.665 --> 00:43:38.467
the whole Christianity's based on that,

1149
00:43:38.467 --> 00:43:40.469
instantaneously, you've gotta drain the blood

1150
00:43:40.469 --> 00:43:41.571
out of the body.

1151
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:43.171
<v Regina>And the ancient Egyptians understood this</v>

1152
00:43:43.171 --> 00:43:44.740
and started embalming.
<v Harvey>Instantaneously</v>

1153
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.075
draining the blood out of the body, right.

1154
00:43:46.075 --> 00:43:48.110
Instantaneously you drain it out and then

1155
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:50.913
you bury the body rapidly, but it's the blood,

1156
00:43:50.913 --> 00:43:51.814
whatever it is-

1157
00:43:51.814 --> 00:43:53.349
<v Regina>It's carrying this force.</v>

1158
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:55.584
<v ->It's carrying that force, that's the sacred force.</v>

1159
00:43:55.584 --> 00:43:57.152
I can't give you further answers.

1160
00:43:57.152 --> 00:43:59.723
It blows me away that everything is in the blood.

1161
00:43:59.723 --> 00:44:02.324
It tells you the whole story.

1162
00:44:02.324 --> 00:44:04.660
Okay, but it's been historical and when I started

1163
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.497
to see this and started to try to put the meanings together

1164
00:44:08.497 --> 00:44:12.405
in the past 20 years, it keeps on, ohh,

1165
00:44:12.405 --> 00:44:15.237
it gets more and more exciting.

1166
00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:19.377
Okay, the more I learn about it, of how the body is working,

1167
00:44:19.377 --> 00:44:21.716
and the blood will tell you every single aspect of

1168
00:44:21.716 --> 00:44:24.080
how it's working and why it's doing.

1169
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.783
<v Regina>When you see blood that has issues (laughs),</v>

1170
00:44:27.783 --> 00:44:31.320
can most people, through attitude and a little bit

1171
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.389
of sunshine and having some fun,

1172
00:44:33.389 --> 00:44:35.157
really correct a whole lot of what's going

1173
00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:36.192
wrong in the body?

1174
00:44:36.192 --> 00:44:38.193
<v ->Only to a certain extent.</v>

1175
00:44:38.193 --> 00:44:40.263
Edgar Cayce said we have an electrical body

1176
00:44:40.263 --> 00:44:42.498
or an energy body and a physical body.

1177
00:44:42.498 --> 00:44:44.166
You treat the electrical body and the energy body

1178
00:44:44.166 --> 00:44:48.771
with electricity, you treat the physical body physically.

1179
00:44:48.771 --> 00:44:51.440
Very important and you must treat them on their

1180
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.108
both plains.

1181
00:44:53.108 --> 00:44:55.878
You can change your attitude, but you can only go

1182
00:44:55.878 --> 00:44:58.146
to a certain extent.

1183
00:44:58.146 --> 00:45:00.583
If you've had a gallbladder surgery

1184
00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:02.451
and you've had scars on your body,

1185
00:45:02.451 --> 00:45:06.989
you can't get past that scar, the emotion behind the scar

1186
00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:09.085
unless there's certain ways that we can actually treat it

1187
00:45:09.085 --> 00:45:11.534
and start to loosen that memory up.

1188
00:45:11.534 --> 00:45:12.795
<v Regina>Is that where the acupuncture and</v>

1189
00:45:12.795 --> 00:45:16.065
homeopathy and osteopath work comes in?

1190
00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:17.773
<v ->They all come together, right, yes.</v>

1191
00:45:17.773 --> 00:45:19.735
And German philosophy we do things like

1192
00:45:19.735 --> 00:45:22.475
neural therapy, we treat the scars to loosen it up

1193
00:45:22.475 --> 00:45:24.974
and get and open things up that way.

1194
00:45:24.974 --> 00:45:28.105
The whole body is a pulsating, expanding, constantly,

1195
00:45:28.105 --> 00:45:30.615
eight to 10 times a minute, it's constantly moving.

1196
00:45:30.615 --> 00:45:34.015
When it scars or injures, it obstructs and it is those

1197
00:45:34.015 --> 00:45:37.125
obstructions that you get, the stagnations and the disease.

1198
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:40.222
You have to break these scars, break the openings,

1199
00:45:40.222 --> 00:45:42.925
let the pulsations go back again.

1200
00:45:42.925 --> 00:45:45.935
Most disease, especially in the United States,

1201
00:45:45.935 --> 00:45:48.435
are created by physicians.

1202
00:45:48.435 --> 00:45:49.803
<v Regina>I was just going to say that.</v>

1203
00:45:49.803 --> 00:45:52.705
Take the subject of Cesarean births, which are now

1204
00:45:52.705 --> 00:45:55.775
encouraged, they're now optional.

1205
00:45:55.775 --> 00:45:59.545
<v ->The stupidity of that, that man, the pompous arrogance</v>

1206
00:45:59.545 --> 00:46:02.245
of man that thinks they know more how to deliver a baby

1207
00:46:02.245 --> 00:46:04.415
than the creator taught us how

1208
00:46:04.415 --> 00:46:06.485
is absolutely horrendous.

1209
00:46:06.485 --> 00:46:09.355
That you have to cut a woman open and pull the baby out.

1210
00:46:09.355 --> 00:46:13.593
23% of newborns are born that way in the US.

1211
00:46:13.593 --> 00:46:16.104
In the Unites States, and I'm a surgeon by trade,

1212
00:46:16.104 --> 00:46:18.143
95% of surgery's a nightmare.

1213
00:46:20.295 --> 00:46:23.032
All disease, the body heals by inflammation.

1214
00:46:23.032 --> 00:46:25.500
It gets ill by suppressed inflammation.

1215
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.303
When you cut into the body, you are creating an inflammatory

1216
00:46:28.303 --> 00:46:31.641
reaction that gets locked into the body.

1217
00:46:31.641 --> 00:46:33.342
There are more surgical interventions in

1218
00:46:33.342 --> 00:46:35.111
the United States and it's one of the reasons why

1219
00:46:35.111 --> 00:46:38.046
we're one of the sicker populations.

1220
00:46:38.046 --> 00:46:40.182
Dentists in the United States, Orthodontists.

1221
00:46:40.182 --> 00:46:41.750
You'll go to an Orthodontist and they'll tell you

1222
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.393
the kid, too many teeth in the mouth,

1223
00:46:43.393 --> 00:46:45.523
let's take the teeth out.

1224
00:46:45.523 --> 00:46:47.893
The creator never put too many teeth in your mouth.

1225
00:46:47.893 --> 00:46:50.363
If you can take braces and change the shape of the mouth,

1226
00:46:50.363 --> 00:46:53.602
well why can't you take braces and stretch the mouth open?

1227
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:55.763
There are dentists around the world that do that,

1228
00:46:55.763 --> 00:46:58.733
stretch the mouth open and the teeth will come in straight.

1229
00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:01.073
But the US wacks em out.

1230
00:47:01.073 --> 00:47:03.943
They do surgeries, the invasions of the body.

1231
00:47:03.943 --> 00:47:06.973
Let's tie off the tubes, you don't need that.

1232
00:47:06.973 --> 00:47:09.003
You don't need, let's take the uterus out,

1233
00:47:09.003 --> 00:47:10.879
okay, you're not gonna need that anymore.

1234
00:47:10.879 --> 00:47:13.048
The Lord wanted the uterus out, he'd put a zipper

1235
00:47:13.048 --> 00:47:14.683
on the darn thing and you'd take it out when

1236
00:47:14.683 --> 00:47:16.585
you're 50 years old.

1237
00:47:16.585 --> 00:47:19.989
The intervention of man into the body is an absolute,

1238
00:47:19.989 --> 00:47:23.625
absolute horror show and it's created so many diseases.

1239
00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:25.259
Right now the third leading cause of death

1240
00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:27.830
in the United States are physicians in hospitals.

1241
00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:29.264
And that is a fact.

1242
00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:30.132
<v Regina>So what happens when we're left</v>

1243
00:47:30.132 --> 00:47:31.366
with all these scars?

1244
00:47:31.366 --> 00:47:33.235
Going back to the subject you were talking about before.

1245
00:47:33.235 --> 00:47:35.871
<v ->There are ways to treat scars, it's called neural therapy,</v>

1246
00:47:35.871 --> 00:47:37.674
scar therapy, there's ways we inject em,

1247
00:47:37.674 --> 00:47:39.809
certain things to loose em up, but scars will always tend

1248
00:47:39.809 --> 00:47:42.078
to pull back in and so about every three months to a year

1249
00:47:42.078 --> 00:47:43.845
you need these treated.

1250
00:47:43.845 --> 00:47:47.149
Osteopathically you need to open up the areas.

1251
00:47:47.149 --> 00:47:49.285
The human being is an electromagnet.

1252
00:47:49.285 --> 00:47:51.820
All living things are electromagnetic.

1253
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.024
Dead things have no charge to it.

1254
00:47:55.024 --> 00:47:57.225
Waste products will accumulate at the scar.

1255
00:47:57.225 --> 00:47:58.259
They're dead.

1256
00:47:58.259 --> 00:48:00.729
You can fast and not clean it up.

1257
00:48:00.729 --> 00:48:03.298
I can do one scar injection and get more garbage out of you,

1258
00:48:03.298 --> 00:48:06.491
a lot of times, because the waste products are just at

1259
00:48:06.491 --> 00:48:08.803
the scar, they're sort of dammed up and blocked there.

1260
00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:10.612
<v Regina>Let's go back to Cesareans, we have a quarter</v>

1261
00:48:10.612 --> 00:48:13.343
of the women giving birth out there that will have

1262
00:48:13.343 --> 00:48:14.813
these horrendous scars and they've cut through

1263
00:48:14.813 --> 00:48:16.311
a lot of tissue there.

1264
00:48:16.311 --> 00:48:17.913
What kind of things gather there?

1265
00:48:17.913 --> 00:48:19.721
<v ->Well, let me just tell you what's going on with</v>

1266
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:21.523
women in the past 50 years.

1267
00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:23.983
It's a nightmare what's gone on with them.

1268
00:48:23.983 --> 00:48:26.922
Number one, the whole sexuality has changed.

1269
00:48:26.922 --> 00:48:29.531
Okay, abortions are now common.

1270
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:32.232
What an abortion is, you're taking a metal rake

1271
00:48:32.232 --> 00:48:34.863
and you're scraping the hell out of it.

1272
00:48:34.863 --> 00:48:36.833
I have more women ill from those things

1273
00:48:36.833 --> 00:48:38.733
and the chronic inflammation.

1274
00:48:38.733 --> 00:48:42.473
I have two cases of IUDs that have caused hepatitis C.

1275
00:48:42.473 --> 00:48:45.273
The amount of inflammation that it creates.

1276
00:48:45.273 --> 00:48:47.043
Okay, the invasion of the woman's body.

1277
00:48:47.043 --> 00:48:48.813
They're tying the tubes off, they're putting these

1278
00:48:48.813 --> 00:48:50.762
bellybutton surgeries in there.

1279
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.284
Two out of every three Lyme disease patients are women.

1280
00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:59.187
Almost all Lyme disease is caused by so much inflammation

1281
00:48:59.187 --> 00:49:02.707
in the body, mostly dental work and female surgery.

1282
00:49:04.029 --> 00:49:05.460
Another thing that goes on with women,

1283
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.497
not just the c-sections, the tampons.

1284
00:49:08.497 --> 00:49:10.766
You wanna stop the HPV?

1285
00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:13.334
Don't give em a vaccine, just get everything out of there.

1286
00:49:13.334 --> 00:49:14.136
<v Regina>Right, makes total</v>

1287
00:49:14.136 --> 00:49:15.103
sense.
<v Harvey>Plain and simple.</v>

1288
00:49:15.103 --> 00:49:16.371
<v Regina>Yeah, plain and simple.</v>

1289
00:49:16.371 --> 00:49:18.440
<v ->Plain and simply, HPV is just a result of</v>

1290
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.742
a deteriorated terrain, that so many things

1291
00:49:20.742 --> 00:49:22.244
have been in there.

1292
00:49:22.244 --> 00:49:25.514
And the cutting apart of it, um,

1293
00:49:25.514 --> 00:49:27.450
it was men that were running the system

1294
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.785
is about the best answer I can give you.

1295
00:49:29.785 --> 00:49:32.420
Okay and they made women the guinea pigs

1296
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.456
and I come back on the sexuality thing,

1297
00:49:34.456 --> 00:49:37.660
god forbid a man should wear a condom in the 60s.

1298
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.629
Let's give the women the pill, let's give her the IUD,

1299
00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:43.554
let's give her the abortion.

1300
00:49:43.554 --> 00:49:45.667
Okay, and all of those things now, what's going on

1301
00:49:45.667 --> 00:49:48.370
with the women and c-sections, an absolute horror show.

1302
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.773
I have never had a patient that needed a c-section.

1303
00:49:51.773 --> 00:49:54.009
All my patients go to either the osteopath or

1304
00:49:54.009 --> 00:49:56.178
someone, a chiropractor, someone who knows

1305
00:49:56.178 --> 00:49:57.912
how to manipulate right.

1306
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.249
They keep the baby lined up right.

1307
00:50:00.249 --> 00:50:02.484
After you give birth, you work on the woman,

1308
00:50:02.484 --> 00:50:04.886
she never, ever gets postpartum depression,

1309
00:50:04.886 --> 00:50:07.122
you get it from the coccyx being jammed up.

1310
00:50:07.122 --> 00:50:10.232
And you work on the baby and the kid gets a 180 IQ,

1311
00:50:10.232 --> 00:50:12.032
becomes creative and you put a do-not-disturb

1312
00:50:12.032 --> 00:50:13.501
sign until death.

1313
00:50:13.501 --> 00:50:14.062
(Regina laughs)

1314
00:50:14.062 --> 00:50:16.432
And you do not need, you do not need c-sections,

1315
00:50:16.432 --> 00:50:18.583
this is a ridiculous concept.

1316
00:50:19.862 --> 00:50:22.805
(stammers) Everything is done defensive medicine.

1317
00:50:22.805 --> 00:50:25.040
You can't, we've gotta do this, we gotta do, oh!

1318
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.176
The baby may get caught, the baby don't know this.

1319
00:50:27.176 --> 00:50:29.451
<v Regina>Right, well, it's highly profitable.</v>

1320
00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:31.746
<v ->Oh yes, it's all fear tactics.</v>

1321
00:50:31.746 --> 00:50:33.648
It's all, "well, no one knows, no one knows,

1322
00:50:33.648 --> 00:50:34.950
"let's do this, let's do that."

1323
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:37.886
You know, to me, it's become a Rodney Dangerfield joke.

1324
00:50:37.886 --> 00:50:39.621
Rodney Dangerfield goes to the doctor and says,

1325
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:41.789
"hey doc, you got anything to stop me from aging?"

1326
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:43.091
And the doctor gives him a gun.

1327
00:50:43.091 --> 00:50:44.358
(both laugh)

1328
00:50:44.358 --> 00:50:45.760
Let's do preventive medicine.

1329
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.695
They haven't found, traditional medicine hasn't found

1330
00:50:47.695 --> 00:50:50.799
the cause of one chronic disease in the 20th century

1331
00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:53.902
nor the cure of one chronic disease in the 20th century.

1332
00:50:53.902 --> 00:50:56.771
What makes them the experts?

1333
00:50:56.771 --> 00:50:58.573
Okay, plain and simple.

1334
00:50:58.573 --> 00:51:01.209
I tell people, your car's transmission failed, you go to

1335
00:51:01.209 --> 00:51:03.278
a mechanic, he says, "I've never fixed a transmission

1336
00:51:03.278 --> 00:51:04.145
"in my life."

1337
00:51:04.145 --> 00:51:05.014
Would you leave the car there?

1338
00:51:05.014 --> 00:51:05.814
Of course not.

1339
00:51:05.814 --> 00:51:07.698
Would you ask him his expert opinion?

1340
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.719
Why do we listen to these expert opinions

1341
00:51:10.719 --> 00:51:12.721
and these failures?

1342
00:51:12.721 --> 00:51:15.657
It's all smoke and mirrors.

1343
00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:17.275
(mysterious music)
Smoke and mirrors.

1344
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.363
<v ->Dr. Bigelsen's extraordinary work is highly regarded</v>

1345
00:51:21.363 --> 00:51:23.699
and often referred to by Bruce Lipton,

1346
00:51:23.699 --> 00:51:25.433
who you can also see on our site,

1347
00:51:25.433 --> 00:51:29.038
as well as with the famed researcher, Dr. Masaru Emoto.

1350
00:51:34.176 --> 00:51:36.545
Until next time, thanks for watching.
