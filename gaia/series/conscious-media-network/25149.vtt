00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:13.832 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing we have learned
in both classical, medical,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and esoteric alternative studies
of the human body is that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
the healing process is far
more complicated than once

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:84%
understood, and
highly individual.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gerald Cohen came
to understand this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
at an early stage
of his education.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%
In addition to his training
in chiropractic medicine

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and homeopathy, Gerald
has made a deep study

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
implications involved

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:90%
in healing the human body.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
He has distilled this vast and
comprehensive understanding

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
into a system he calls
the healing process.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to meet
with you, Gerald.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, just for
the viewers' sake,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I met you through a
friend of mine who's

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
done lots of deep research into
healing, healing processes,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and people that really
have the broadest

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the human
being and the healing mechanism.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said you've got
to interview Gerald Cohen.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're here, and as we've
just been talking off-camera

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:90%
a little bit--

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:90%
you have a really rich history.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And give us an idea of where
your philosophy in healing in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:90%
such a broad spectrum way began.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it began many years
ago, actually, in Jerusalem,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
where I was taking a course with
a very old Kabbalist who was 94

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was teaching us exactly
how intention becomes creation.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.276 align:middle line:84%
And it was very difficult
to get in to see him,

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
because you literally
had to punch to get in,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
there were so many people in
a small room trying to get in.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And I used to wear a
black coat and pretend

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I was part of their community,
and go in and listen

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:90%
to the teachings.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of it I understood,
and some of it I didn't, because

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:90%
of the accent.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I was up on Mount
Zion, and looking at some

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:90%
of the displays up there.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, but
how do we do repair?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody's
teaching how things manifest

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
but nobody is teaching how to
actually repair the damage when

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:90%
things don't manifest correctly.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And that became
my lifelong quest,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.752 align:middle line:84%
to understand how the
healing process takes place.

00:02:25.752 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I believed
it was important

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
not only for
individuals, but it was

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
important for
humanity as a whole,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth as a whole,
and creation as a whole.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've been at
this many, many years now.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And off-camera,
you were saying you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
started exploring the work of
a 15th century philosopher.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> 14th century.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> 14th century philosopher?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, named Cicatilia.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And he helped me put a
structure and a framework

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
on what became my quest,
my passion for life,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
in that he said that we come
into this world with a very

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
precise intention,
and in that intention,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
we have enough time
and enough energy

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to express the
answer to that one

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
question that governs our life.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And how our life unfolds
becomes the answer.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said that the
symptoms that we experience,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is
uncomfortable with,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
are actually the map back
to our original intention,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and that eliminating the
symptoms without following

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
the map ruins the possibility
to authenticate ourselves

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, what a profound,
beautiful way to state it.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow,
this man understood.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
started working forward

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:84%
to try to reverse engineer
the patterns of creation

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.426 align:middle line:90%
into the patterns of healing.

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you
have symptomology,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.964 align:middle line:84%
these are your little
keystones to find your way back

00:04:01.964 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
to your true intent
and purpose is life?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, that's your
subconscious telling you where

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
you're diverted from
your original intention,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that our whole purpose of living
is to express a very particular

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
question that's
totally unique to you.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
And if you lose
that opportunity,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that question will
never be answered.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And if it's answered,
if it's authenticated,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
it becomes part of the entangled
fabric of consciousness

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
that evolves way past
our own lifetimes.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's fair
to say that this would be

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
the polar opposite of allopathic
medicine and its practices,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> In some ways.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It depends if you look at
allopathic as a tool Instead

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.485 align:middle line:90%
of a solution.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> There is value
in allopathic--

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> As a solution, you
mask the symptoms.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And don't go any
further than the physical.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we see some people
that are extremely sick.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you have to use
some allopathic medicine, yes.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to use
allopathic sometimes.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
What I'm against is the
misuse of allopathic,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
not the use of it.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if you suppress the
body's attempt to heal itself,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
you're actually driving the
condition deeper and deeper

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.032 align:middle line:84%
inside them, and then
you get distortion.

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I can
appreciate that difference.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, looking
around your office,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
you have a very rich
history in Eastern,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and Tibetan, and many
of the other healing

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:84%
modalities, including
some more high tech

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
modern technologies, using
frequencies, into homeopathy,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:90%
craniosacral.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
You really embrace
all of it, and this

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:84%
is because, as you were
pointing out a moment ago,

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the individual
journey is the point.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not about slapping
whatever the newest patented

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:84%
drug is over the
entire population.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the biochemical
pathways are

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
too complex to be answered by
a very large molecule, which

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:90%
is pharmaceutical medicine.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The actual healing has to
take part on micro-doses

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:90%
and signaling capacity.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can suppress
symptoms and buy time

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:84%
for people, which
can be valuable

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:90%
if they're very, very sick.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
address themselves

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:84%
as a complete person that
can function not only

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
physically, but also
emotionally, mentally,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and eventually spiritually,
then it has to be a process.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a single intervention.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And part of the reason you
attracted an interesting array

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
of people to you--

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
not the least of which are some
of the local Silicon Valley

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
physicists and scientists, some
of whom we've interviewed--

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you not only work with
them, but they've also

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:90%
been students of yours--

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is because you have struck
upon this key of this much

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:90%
higher understanding.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to say,
you're definitely

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.284 align:middle line:84%
spilling over into
spiritual understanding

00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:06.325 align:middle line:90%
throughout your practice.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm very scientifically
oriented.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I specialize

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is brain chemistry,
and hormonal testing,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and individual biochemistry,
and individual genetics

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:90%
and epigenetics.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when I can
talk about that,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:84%
scientists are very,
very comfortable

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
in that we can measure
the communication,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:90%
and we can measure objectively.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So not only scientists,
but engineers like it

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:90%
because we have the data.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:90%
We look at the data.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we initiate
the process with people.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
try to teach them

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
how to individuate
themselves through reducing

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
their stress through different
meditation techniques

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:90%
or lifestyle changes.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's look at this--

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go one direction,
I've just changed my mind.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
epigenetics that are involved

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:90%
in a profile of health.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
Bruce Lipton, certainly,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
has brought information
to the forefront through--

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --for the last several years.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's an area that's just
really now being embraced

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and explored a little
bit more fully.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
He was considered out there
in the wings in the beginning.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about it
from your perspective.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's two
places that it started,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and then it developed
also from Sweden.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
The one was McGill
University in Montreal,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and one was Duke University.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And in McGill, they
did experiments

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
with mice that had obesity, and
diabetes, and chronic disease.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And they had what was
called the agouti defect.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing--
that was the first understanding

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
of epigenetics.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the agouti defect?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a genetic defect that
predisposed them to obesity

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> And diabetes?

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.445 align:middle line:84%
>> --and sugar problems so
they would be extremely fat

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and slow-moving, and subject
to very degenerative disease,

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:90%
early death etc.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And they fed them a high
diet that methylated--

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
in other words that attached to
the gene, That's methylation--

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and methylation is
what shuts off a gene.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.795 align:middle line:84%
So the offspring
were born normally.

00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:31.412 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.412 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing--
this is how we knew about

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:90%
epigenetics--

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
was the offspring
of the offspring

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
were no longer treated
with methylation,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and they continued to be born
normally even though they still

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
had the gene.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA doesn't change,
but the tags on the DNA--

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.065 align:middle line:90%
what's-- called the histones--

00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:51.865 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Now in understanding
epigenetics from the human

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
animal, the way Bruce Lipton
has framed it is this has a lot

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to do with our overriding
cultural, familial,

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and personal thoughts
and beliefs systems,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:90%
in terms of how this programs.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you relate
that to lab rats

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.184 align:middle line:90%
who would not have that?

00:10:15.184 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They would not
have any attachment

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to any particular
beliefs or philosophy,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and just explain how this
works between the two.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't really want to
talk about Bruce Lipton's work.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.167 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I mean the other.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
How does this-- we're talking
about beliefs on one hand.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, Bruce Lipton is
into the cellular membrane,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that the cellular
membrane retains memory.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So as different molecules go in
and out, it retains the memory,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and then the memory is
transferred generation

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:90%
to generation.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And Candace Pert talked
about the neural peptides,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:84%
the protein molecules,
the tiny kinase

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
signals going in between the
cells, and they also retain.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you use a language,
I'm crazy, I'm sick,

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
nobody likes me,
nobody loves me,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:84%
that memory is retained
on a cellular level that

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.096 align:middle line:90%
affects the membrane.

00:11:10.096 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And then this is
passed on subsequently?

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So they had a town in
Sweden that some researcher

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
found that kept meticulous
records for over 200 years

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:90%
about all the residents.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
a lot of immigration.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So the data was sent to
Cambridge University,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:90%
which analyzed it.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And they found what was
going on in that town

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
with the residents of the
town and with their help

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
was affected by
signals that were

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
coming from the grandparents.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So in females, it would come
from the maternal grandmother

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
when she was in gestation
with her mother,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%
so the great-grandmother.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So what the great-grandmother
was experiencing

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
would be passed on
to the grandchild

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:90%
on the maternal side.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So if she was living
a life of excess--

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:90%
there was plenty of food--

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:84%
they would have
diseases of excess.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Two generations?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Two generations.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Now in boys it was different,
it was the paternal grandfather

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.490 align:middle line:90%
at puberty that was passed on.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So if there was a
period of starvation

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
the boys were having, you would
have diseases of retention,

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
which would predispose
people to chronic disease,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
because the body
would store too much.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And I had a case like that--

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's on my website,
or at least I wrote about it--

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
where I was referred a girl from
parents who were from Guatemala

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.452 align:middle line:90%
for tremendous weight gain.

00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was a simple case,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:84%
it was probably junk food,
she's a teenager, eating poorly.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And all my assumptions
were completely wrong.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:84%
She comes in,
she's an A student.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
They ate a natural diet.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:84%
She was on the soccer team,
and she was doing well in life.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
she kept gaining weight,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and really getting to
a point of obesity.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So I knew this about
the epigenetics.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:90%
And I questioned the mother.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, what was
it like when your mother was

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:90%
born to your great-grandmother?

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about it?

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Which was in Guatemala.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
there was 12 children

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and there was never
enough to eat.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So the epigenetic
signal was transferred

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
on to the
granddaughter to store.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Now we know the actual
biochemical way that happens,

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:84%
that the excess is
stored in the fat cells.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And the fat cells--

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:84%
if the liver gives
the wrong signal--

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
can expand and become
inflamed as much as 100 times

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:90%
its original size.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And it started
explaining to me why

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I have people coming to see me
who have tremendous obesity,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're in the
gym three hours a day,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're eating
hardly anything,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and they keep gaining weight.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that they're exposed to

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.987 align:middle line:90%
is stored in the fat cells.

00:14:11.987 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And you see that now
with the epidemic

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
we're having with
estrogen dominance.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Almost everybody
is under stress.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
The estrogen, which
tells the body build,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
store, and progesterone tells
the body what to build into.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
The progesterone
converts too rapidly

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
into cortisol, which is the
sugar mechanism in stress.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the body has
unopposed estrogen.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.189 align:middle line:84%
You can have low estrogen and
still have estrogen dominance.

00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what are the effects
of estrogen dominance again?

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of them is thyroid,
because progesterone signals

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.916 align:middle line:90%
the thyroid.

00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have a lot of
hypothyroidism, for example?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a lot of hypothyroid,
but it's not coming from

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:90%
the thyroid.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.437 align:middle line:90%
That's why we have it.

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's saying, I
don't have enough energy

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
to keep doing what I am,
I'm going to shut down

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.305 align:middle line:90%
so I don't blow a gasket.

00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:02.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:15:02.215 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's really an adrenal
problem, a stress problem.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the body's
tearing itself apart,

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
it's catabolic, which
means tearing itself apart.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you tear apart your
body, you have to rebuild it.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
the right signals,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have the right
nutrients to rebuild yourself.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So every single day,
you recreate yourself.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're imbalanced
one way or the other,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
certain problems,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we're seeing.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're seeing so
much disability, and lack

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:84%
of adaptation,
and people looking

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to take drugs or
something to keep

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
them going to mitigate
the imbalances that we're

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing, which is basically
an allergy to modern life.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly, to stress.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, a couple of questions then.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Has science determined why it
is that it skips a generation?

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> That was actually
noticed in ancient times.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:90%
If you go back to homeopathy--

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we've heard
it all, but why?

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all heard the
notion it skips a generation.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if we
understand it scientifically,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
but I think we understand
it spiritually.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we've always had
in spiritual traditions

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that grandparents
transfer the traditions

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
on to the grandchildren
to continue

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:84%
the purpose for living,
and the passion for life,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and this sense of community.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.235 align:middle line:84%
If you see how we
develop neurologically,

00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
it comes a lot of times
from that connection

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:84%
of living with your
grandparents in a community.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
to have a healthy life,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to have six things
every day, seven days a week.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Which are?

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> One of them is challenge.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to push yourself a
little bit every single day.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:57.582 align:middle line:84%
Complexity, nutrition, movement,
nurturing, and community.

00:16:57.582 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't have
community in the same way.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't have extended
family in the same way.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening
to us physiologically?

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can go on all
levels, but since we're

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
talking about the body, what
happens to us when we don't

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:84%
have the direct contact
with the previous generation

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to our parents,
our grandparents?

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.701 align:middle line:90%
What do you see en masse?

00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> En masse lack of oxytocin,
which is what gives us

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
a communal sense, gives
us a sense of belonging,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:90%
gives a timeless sense.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It makes us a part of
something, the same hormone

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that a mother bonds with
her children in lactation.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we get
instead, which is

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
interesting from an biologically
evolutionary standpoint,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.192 align:middle line:84%
we get a lot more vasopressin,
which is only two molecules

00:17:42.192 --> 00:17:43.775 align:middle line:84%
difference, which
is quite incredible.

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:46.655 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the is the difference
between what that provides?

00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Vasopressin gives
you high blood pressure.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
It's pushing to survive.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh interesting.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Which makes perfect sense
if you don't have the other.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.058 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, oxytocin has to be
present just to get the child

00:17:56.058 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:90%
out into the world.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But to bond the child
so it feels protected.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think-- this
is my own theory--

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that in mammalian
life, what made

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
the mother want to
self-sacrifice herself

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.036 align:middle line:90%
for her children?

00:18:13.036 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It would be oxytocin.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And what would make her-- if
some predator wanted to eat her

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:90%
children--

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the ferocious defender
of her children,

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
she had to rapidly
convert it to vasopressin

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
to defend the lives of her child
for generations to continue.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we have in the modern
world is a lack of oxytocin,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:84%
which means a lack of
nurturing, a lack of safety.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> A lack of supportive
community emotionally,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:90%
that's what we experience.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah then--

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.466 align:middle line:90%
>> And-- go ahead, please.

00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that's
the nurturing part.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:90%
You have to get touched.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing is,
in the work on oxytocin,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
to get oxytocin it has
to be a non-sexual touch

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.175 align:middle line:90%
in the front of the body.

00:18:58.175 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You get a back rub, you
don't get any oxytocin.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.642 align:middle line:90%
>> At the belly, though.

00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The front of the
body, and non-sexual.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.335 align:middle line:90%
>> The hands?

00:19:04.335 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's why people hug.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And people that
don't get hugged.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.749 align:middle line:84%
And how many people do we
know never get touched?

00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Nobody even touches them.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Many, many.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I hear people that
nobody's held their hand.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's touched,
gently, their face.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And how are they supposed to
develop into who they are?

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And as part of a broad-based
community that's timeless?

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we authenticate
ourselves by expressing

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:90%
the uniqueness within us?

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Because this is basically
a precious rare opportunity

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of leisure, that we are
a very unusual species,

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is that we have the time
to reflect on these things,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:90%
and to grow in a soul way.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is fascinating.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
can feel viscerally

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
what the result has been of
not having extended family,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
not having that
great-grandparental kind

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of love, or that grandparental
kind of love that you have,

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
which tends to be unconditional.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the responsibilities
of parenthood

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
are not on that
generation any longer.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you look at the
universality of what everybody

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:90%
wants--

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:90%
unless there's brain damage--

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
there's not a person
alive that doesn't want

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:90%
to be unconditionally loved.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Wants to be understood.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And the grandparents are often
the very ones that offer that

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to our lives, and yet when
we grow up without them,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you can feel the
tension in the being.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's very easy to
get lost in this world.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happens then?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we are.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Yet on some levels, whether
we know our grandparents

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
or don't, or spend
time with them or not,

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:84%
we're still being
programmed on another level

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:90%
by them biologically and such.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And what if we have some kind
of a chronic condition that

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:90%
has come to us in this manner?

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you break these patterns?

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The way we break
these patterns is--

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
what the Dalai Lama
said is that we're

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
drawn to what's
most familiar, it

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:90%
gives us suffering and torment.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So you break the
patterns by doing

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:90%
something totally different.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the problem is,
and you have to be determined.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Like we talked about, you have
to have the right nutrition.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:90%
You have to be moving.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have
a sense of purpose

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and a connection
with other people

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that's beyond your
own individual needs.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go back to the girl the
was obese who was a straight A

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.775 align:middle line:84%
student and doing
everything right.

00:21:43.775 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:90%
What did you find with her?

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.315 align:middle line:84%
Was she able to
break the pattern?

00:21:46.315 --> 00:21:48.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, she was able
to break the pattern.

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>What did you do for her,
just as one living example?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
What did you help
her do for herself?

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, two things.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.447 align:middle line:84%
I used homeopathy,
which in my mind--

00:21:57.447 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going
to talk about that.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, in my mind, that's
the epigenetic signal.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the kinase signal
that signals the body

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:90%
to go back to center.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's the tag.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And I used the type
of diet that was

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.525 align:middle line:84%
consistent with
her own genetics.

00:22:17.525 --> 00:22:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:90%
We did a detox.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.205 align:middle line:84%
She started losing weight
within three weeks.

00:22:28.205 --> 00:22:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
homeopathics now.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something that
has not caught on in the US

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's been
around for a long time.

00:22:39.342 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Long time, couple
hundred years.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It did catch on,
but it got lost?

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.895 align:middle line:90%
>> When did it catch?

00:22:45.895 --> 00:22:48.095 align:middle line:90%
>> In the 1900s.

00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so they were
using it in the 1900s?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There were
homeopathic hospitals.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
There was 45 homeopathic
medical schools.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But this was
decades ago now, right?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we lost it
for political reasons.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of the 1970s,
I met with an old homeopath

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
in Chicago.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And he told me what
happened politically.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It was never made illegal.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And even Aaron Copeland,
who was a eye surgeon,

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and became senator
from New York,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and treated the President
of the United States,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:90%
had it grandfathered in.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
with homeopathy is

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that you can't patent
homeopathic medicines.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:29.678 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's no money.

00:23:29.678 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No profit, yeah.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when the Flexner
Report in 1914 said all medical

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
schools should be organized
and have the same initial basic

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:84%
science curriculum, the
homeopaths signed on.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And they were
promised that there

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
would be funding for homeopathic
residencies, similar to what's

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
today in Germany, where
there's a two-year residency

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:90%
after medical school.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happened then
is that nobody funded

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:90%
the residencies.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And this-- you said 1914?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It started in 1914,
but by the 1920s,

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
it was difficult for new
people to become homeopaths

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because there was
no funding for them.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the homeopathic
colleges had now

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
become part of the
allopathic colleges.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people have the
myth that there was only a war

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
between the allopaths
and the homeopaths.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But modern pharmacology
came from homeopathy,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.080 align:middle line:84%
the purity laws, and
the that the idea

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:31.787 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need these high
doses of debilitating drugs,

00:24:31.787 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and that you had to know the
source of everything, which

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.306 align:middle line:84%
today in pharmacology
is called assay,

00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:90%
to make sure of its purity.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
The homeopaths had that first,
and a lot of the homeopaths,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:90%
they worked together.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when the medical schools
stopped funding residencies

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
there was no financial
incentive for people

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.632 align:middle line:84%
to do homeopathy unless they
wanted to do it on their own.

00:24:59.632 --> 00:25:01.682 align:middle line:84%
>> And it takes
quite a lot more.

00:25:01.682 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't go in for
a seven-minute office

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
visit, as you can in
a lot of the HMOs.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
They process them through
about every seven minutes.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
A homeopath actually takes quite
a lot of time with this person,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
reflecting on all
aspects of their life,

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:90%
so this is labor-intensive.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.825 align:middle line:84%
Because it's based
on my ignorance.

00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:23.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:23.695 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I catch on something
quicker, if I know something,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:90%
it takes less time.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:84%
If I have to learn something new
it's going to take me longer.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I just have
one fee for patients,

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.226 align:middle line:84%
because I never know
how long it's going

00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:38.191 align:middle line:90%
to take me to understand it.

00:25:38.191 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And I also incorporate
other things,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
because I do a lot of neurology,
and a lot of lab testing.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And I include that
in the homeopathy.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So the homeopathy, basically,
is the individuation of signals.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:90%
So when we're born--

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.850 align:middle line:84%
if you know neurology,
one of the things--

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the way our brain
exists, you and I

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be having
this conversation

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
if there wasn't for
brain-derived neurotrophic

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.610 align:middle line:90%
factor.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Because the target
neuron has to signal back

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
the non-target
neuron, and it has

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to signal back with
brain-derived neurotrophic

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
factor at a dilution
of one to 100 billion.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So in English?

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In English, that if
you don't have a massive--

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
tiny micro dose that can't
even be measured in our brain

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
we don't have any communication
and there's no life.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.057 align:middle line:84%
So we're pre-programmed for
these homeopathic doses.

00:26:31.057 --> 00:26:31.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's exactly
what Montagnier,

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
who got the Nobel Prize
for medicine in 2008--

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
he's the world's most
respected virologist.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
He's discovering
in his labs today

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.446 align:middle line:84%
that the signals and
the high dilutions,

00:26:51.446 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and right now, they
have the technology

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to measure 10 to the 18th.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Guess what 1 to 100 billion is?

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:90%
10 to the 18th.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 to the 18th.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.995 align:middle line:84%
>> And they said it's
just a matter of time.

00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is beyond-- now
there's really no original mass

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:90%
of any kind.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There's none of the original
substance left of that.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> But the signal remains.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The signal remains, yes.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So it causes--

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:13.991 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's what's in--

00:27:13.991 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And in peer-reviewed
papers, called ghost DNA,

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
he shows that the body continues
to produce the enzymes even

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
though there's no more
physical substance.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's responding
to a signal,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but there's no longer
a molecule that exists.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And he came out and said that
the homeopaths got it right,

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and the solutions
to modern conditions

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:84%
will be found in
the high dilutions.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I just love that.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have so much
respect for homeopathy.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And so we're looking at--

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about the high dilutions,

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
just explain it for people
who have not already

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:84%
studied homeopathy, and kind of
the essence of what this means

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
in terms of potentizing and
getting that signal solidly

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
entrenched into the medium
of water, or water-alcohol,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> These signals-- basically,
it says the more we non-exist,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:90%
the more potent the signal.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.245 align:middle line:90%
>> So you take a substance?

00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.052 align:middle line:84%
>> And it is now put
into a water substance,

00:28:16.052 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a little water-alcohol
carrier or something.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it goes
through three processes.

00:28:19.968 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's just take a real
life example of say, digitalis.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Digitalis is a herb that's
always been used for the heart.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then on a
pharmacological dose

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.360 align:middle line:84%
it's done for chest
contractions and chest pain.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:84%
In a homeopathic dose, you
would serially dilute it.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You would succuss it,
and you would titrate

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:90%
it, which means to mix it.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.797 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, the more
you keep reducing it by going

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
through that process--
and I've done--

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> They take a drop out,
put it in another bottle,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
take a drop out of that bottle,
put it in another bottle.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of that.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:58.936 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, just roughly so--

00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but usually, we
do it in porcelain bowls.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, just
to get the idea,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about a
dilution of a drop of one

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.324 align:middle line:84%
of the previous bowls
into an entire bowl

00:29:09.324 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:90%
of fluid at the other.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And then isn't there a
process of moving and shaking?

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, shaking.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Shaking it to potentize it?

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But the scientists found that
the way the homeopaths did it,

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.496 align:middle line:90%
the succussion.

00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:90%
The same thing works with--

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> What is succssion?

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Shaking.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the shaking.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but a centrifuge
will do the same thing.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Benveniste in the 1980s--

00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:28.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:29:28.525 --> 00:29:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> --working with antibodies
found the same thing with

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.350 align:middle line:90%
a centrifuge.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.315 align:middle line:90%
So the memory remains.

00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And the information remains,
and the signal remains even

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.210 align:middle line:84%
though you don't
have a physical form.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Remember, life exists by speed.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The faster something goes,
the heavier it becomes.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a law of physics.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>> So when you take away--

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, speed equals mass.

00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you take
away the heaviness,

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:84%
you're left with
the original signal,

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.740 align:middle line:84%
which controls the
focus of your life.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And why this world is
so important for us

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to have a full experience
is because it's

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:90%
designed for experience.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
The heavier it is, the more
concentrated our experience,

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and experience
predates consciousness.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're on this
homeopathic thing.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Our being is transmitting
information between the cells

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:90%
always?

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're talking about
beings that are electrical

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Light plays into it.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Doesn't it make perfect sense
that homeopathy is the match

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
for an electrical being sending
information electrically

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:90%
between cells?

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, electromagnetic

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's stored in the
matrix in between the cells.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it's transferred
to the cells when

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.410 align:middle line:84%
there's something unique
that needs to be expressed.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And that activates the DNA.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So what basically
happens is that it

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
goes from intention, from the
spiritual, to the mental level,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:84%
which you get
duality, but you also

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
get habits, down to
the emotional level,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:90%
which you get individuation.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
That's where you
have the choice.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:84%
There's always six
options, and we

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
tend to choose the most
familiar one, which tends

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:90%
to be the most destructive one.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the activation on
the action, on the physical,

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:90%
is the consciousness.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we choose to act becomes
the level of our consciousness.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And if it becomes elegant and
unique, it continues forever.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:84%
If it becomes destructive,
and hurtful, and painful,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and dysfunctional, and
pathological, and mean,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:90%
it dissipates.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have a choice
on whether we

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:84%
want to accomplish something
that will continue forever,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.920 align:middle line:84%
or do we want to dissipate
something destructive in us,

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
disappear altogether?

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
trend today, where

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing a lot of
self-destructiveness and

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.590 align:middle line:90%
communal destructiveness.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But you're also
seeing an elevation

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.940 align:middle line:84%
of higher consciousness, where
a certain percentage of people

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
have joined communities and
want to express themselves

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.090 align:middle line:90%
in a way that benefits others.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:35.266 align:middle line:84%
And we're sort of in a race
for time as we're doing this.

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Now if we take what you
were just talking about--

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and let's be really kind
of visceral about it.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Go back to digitalis.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:46.236 align:middle line:84%
We go back to a person that has
a heart problem, for example.

00:32:46.236 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at
their highest potential,

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and in their matrix in life,
what their soul came in,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.120 align:middle line:84%
the purpose that
they came in for,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and that something is
expressed now in heart issues.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's follow that through
in a situation like that.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
now have heart issues.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
broken heart issues.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Broken heart
issues, absolutely.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people have
been hurt by others.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people have
been abused by others.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is a big one.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
This is very common,
very prevalent.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
going back to this imprint

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of the information
from the herb digitalis

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:90%
into the homeopathics.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
How does this begin working
between the cells in the body,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
with the matrix, with
the consciousness,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:90%
with the sole purpose?

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
How does that all clink,
clink, clink together?

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can only
talk about myself.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't use homeopathy
the traditional way.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.915 align:middle line:84%
I use it as an individuation
process of signaling.

00:33:41.915 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, please tell us.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm a
classical-trained homeopath,

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:84%
but I look at the homeopathy as
a series of events to bring us

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:84%
back to center, not one remedy
that controls everything

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So if a person with
a broken heart,

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to go back to
the epigenetic signal.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So you might want to go back
to the birth and the mother,

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:08.540 align:middle line:90%
homeopathically.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So you would see
people, for example,

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:90%
people with skin problems.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:90%
What are they really expressing?

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people
with skin problems--

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:90%
unprotected.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.860 align:middle line:84%
What are people that
have heart problems?

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:90%
They're unprotected.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.909 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart
controls the blood flow.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.705 align:middle line:90%
The heart has a mind of its own.

00:34:31.705 --> 00:34:32.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:32.656 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a brain
that's around the heart,

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:84%
separate from the
brain in the head.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And so for digitalis to work--

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:90%
you picked that particular one--

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.330 align:middle line:84%
it has to be a person that's
governed by their sensitivity.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So does that person
have a problem

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:84%
where they're so sensitive, and
they are experiencing so much,

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that they're taking
in what's not theirs?

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Especially if
they've had partners,

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.890 align:middle line:84%
or they had families that
had no clue of who they are.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the heart
starts to dysfunction

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:90%
as a protective mechanism.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:08.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:08.845 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So for that to work for a
person with a heart condition,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
governed by sensitivity.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:90%
But usually, that predates that.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the signals that were
coming in when they were born.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So we might use vernix,
for example, which

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.170 align:middle line:90%
is the covering of the baby.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:90%
We might use amniotic fluid.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.997 align:middle line:84%
People they can't
detoxify, we might use--

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, I'm
seeing, especially

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:84%
with men who have issues
with women, what's

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:84%
called lac maternum, which
is made out of the mother's

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.990 align:middle line:90%
milk of many women.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Or use lac humanum, which is
mother's milk from one woman.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have a whole
series occluding--

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
so if it's an if it's a woman
with an issue with her father,

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:90%
placenta.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the only thing
that comes from the father,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to give the baby the
evolutionary advantage

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:90%
over the mother.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So the nutrients go first to the
placenta, which feeds the baby,

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.520 align:middle line:84%
it comes from the
father's chromosome.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea is that
there's some sort of drive

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that's behind all this, some
superior consciousness that

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:84%
really is pushing for
something to be expressed.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more
intense the conditions,

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
the more powerful the
consciousness that emerges.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the things
that we're experiencing

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.320 align:middle line:84%
with heart disease is that
people are not living,

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:84%
they're not eating the
foods, and they're not

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
having the quality
of relationships

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:90%
that would prevent all this.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.720 align:middle line:84%
They are out of
touch with nature.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
They're out of touch
with their own nature.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And they're stressed out.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the heart will
shut down in response

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to the signals
from the adrenals.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the thyroid
will start dysfunctioning

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't want
you to blow a gasket.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And the phenomena in the last
couple of decades was at one

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.690 align:middle line:84%
time more exclusive to males
to have these severe heart

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Now it's democratic.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Many more women have
heart issues than were--

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're seeing things
we've never seen before.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Such as?

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're seeing a lot of
estrogen dominance with women

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:90%
It's really an epidemic.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And estrogen tells
the body to grow.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see so many
fibroids and ovarian cysts.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And progesterone tells
the body what to grow in.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you're depleted
right away of progesterone,

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:84%
which you have if
you're under stress,

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:90%
you have uncontrolled growth.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have women trying to
push themselves to be something

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:84%
they're not, because
underneath, no matter

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
how beautiful they are and
how successful they are,

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.350 align:middle line:84%
there's an underneath fear
that they're inadequate.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't keep
up, they'll be abandoned.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And you see this in your
practice repeatedly with women,

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.315 align:middle line:84%
this innate fear of being less
than or feeling less than.

00:38:05.315 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman that had
gone to 32 homeopaths.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And she was a really
accomplished artist,

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't leave the
house for longer than an hour.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was referred by a
really great homeopath, who

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:84%
said to go to me because I
look at things differently

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:90%
than most people.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me, and she was
telling me all the problems

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:84%
she had with her mother, and
all these type of problems.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
her father was great.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So I right away figured
out it has to be something

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:90%
to do with the father.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Because she's dealt
with her mother,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and she's gone
through a lot of this.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And it really came
from that she didn't

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
feel she was beautiful
enough because she

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.875 align:middle line:84%
didn't look like the
girls in the magazines.

00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh god, and that
is an epidemic.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> And that is an epidemic.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I said,
I have some news for you

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.914 align:middle line:90%
from my personal experience.

00:39:00.914 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:84%
The girls in the magazines
don't look like the girls

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:03.585 align:middle line:90%
in the magazines.

00:39:03.585 --> 00:39:04.751 align:middle line:90%
>> (LAUGHING) No they don't.

00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:84%
That takes a lot of Photoshop
to get a girl in the magazine.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:08.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:08.415 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And having 15-year-old
girls sporting age intervention

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.600 align:middle line:90%
creams and serums.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a really disaster.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> When you put poison into your
body to look in a way that you

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.011 align:middle line:90%
don't really look.

00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they tell
you that's beautiful.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:29.085 --> 00:39:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, what are you
actually activating in yourself

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:90%
and the people around you?

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever you are,
you're not good enough,

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.495 align:middle line:90%
which is a horrible message.

00:39:37.495 --> 00:39:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you think that because
of the media dominance of this

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:45.190 align:middle line:84%
particular message, which is
very inspirational if you want

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to keep the consuming
machine going.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're not good enough,
you have to buy more stuff

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But you think it's because
of the media propagating this

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.000 align:middle line:84%
message that so much of this
is now this, as you say,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
estrogen dominance and
fear-based lifestyle and such

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.770 align:middle line:90%
has come to play?

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the media, for sure,
has a lot to do with that,

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.889 align:middle line:90%
creating false images.

00:40:08.889 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:84%
But we've heard that even
in the spiritual world.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
teachers convincing

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:18.130 align:middle line:84%
people they have to follow
them, and subjugate themselves,

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
which is the exact opposite
of what people need to do.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.441 align:middle line:90%
It's all across the board.

00:40:22.441 --> 00:40:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It's people teaching
you whatever you are,

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:90%
you have to be something else.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And we go way back to
many spiritual teachings,

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.060 align:middle line:84%
which tells you you
have to be who you are.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And everybody is different.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the autoimmune
disease we're seeing

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:44.530 align:middle line:84%
is people that are basically
governed by their own autonomy,

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
cut off from that.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Their own autonomy means that
they experience themselves

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:84%
for what's within
themselves, not

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:84%
necessarily from the feedback
when they get to the world.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's another thing that--

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:56.815 align:middle line:84%
>> So the system
turns on itself?

00:40:56.815 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> When they've cut off from
their own source of themselves?

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it starts
attacking itself.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It starts confusing itself
as the outside enemy.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it over-reactive, and
that's why we're having so much

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.610 align:middle line:90%
chronic disease--

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.660 align:middle line:90%
one of the reasons.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's many reasons.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's a major one that
we see with cancers and things

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
like that, is people trying
to be something they're not,

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and trying to be something
that doesn't actually exist.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you're trying to be
something that doesn't exist,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:90%
you've created a delusion.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you create
a delusion, you

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:84%
have to keep building
on the delusion,

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.900 align:middle line:84%
because delusions and
illusions attract other ones

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.460 align:middle line:90%
to perpetuate themselves.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not governed
by evolutionary growth.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.155 align:middle line:84%
Only something that's
authentic actually evolves.

00:41:48.155 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, you're
cut off from your own nature

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:84%
completely, and anything
can happen in the medium

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:55.870 align:middle line:90%
of the body after that.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the message
that the amygdala,

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.470 align:middle line:90%
the part of the brain, gives?

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Your survival, in effect.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're not being you,
then you might disappear.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.085 align:middle line:90%
You might be eaten for dinner.

00:42:09.085 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you have people
walking around fear if they

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.900 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
latest this and that,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
willing to go into lifelong
debt to have things they

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.550 align:middle line:84%
don't really need, because
they have to meet certain

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:90%
expectations.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And another word for
expectation is delusions.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And homeopathic grew
from calming down

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:84%
the reactions to the
delusions that are built up.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:37.089 align:middle line:84%
It's not just modern life,
it's been a long time

00:42:37.089 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that people have been
pressured to do things that

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.140 align:middle line:90%
are not part of our nature.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this a really a kind of down
in the trenches question about

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:90%
homeopathy.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.354 align:middle line:90%
But I've wondered about it.

00:42:49.354 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And a friend once
said something,

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of
piqued my curiosity.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They were saying, I
think I'm just going

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to have a homeopathic dose of--

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I think it was chocolate.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But then I started
thinking about that.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, can we use
substances like coffee,

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and put a little
under your tongue

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and swirl it around, and take
the energy and information in,

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy whatever
benefits you might

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.235 align:middle line:84%
have as a homeopathic
dose of anything?

00:43:17.235 --> 00:43:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can make a
homeopathic dose of anything,

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
even a sound.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so coffee has been used
for a long time for insomnia,

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.190 align:middle line:90%
coffea cruda.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, coffea cruda.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, like you're saying, in
this homeopathic information.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.855 align:middle line:90%
>> But remember, it's a signal.

00:43:34.855 --> 00:43:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's a signal.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> it's not a drug effect.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, you
can get the right signal,

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.020 align:middle line:84%
but if you haven't
corrected the physiology,

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:90%
you don't have the right medium.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
right nutrients.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:84%
You haven't corrected
the biochemistry.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You're getting the signal
without the environment

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.130 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.519 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.519 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's just say for your
average person in the morning,

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.300 align:middle line:84%
if you want to get off caffeine,
but you still like a little bit

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.720 align:middle line:84%
of that information, the spike
and the clarity of the mind,

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.510 align:middle line:84%
can you just take a little
sip, roll it under the tongue,

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and instruct the body to take
in the information and call it

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.809 align:middle line:90%
good?

00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Or does it work that simply?

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for certain symptoms,
it can suppress certain

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:90%
symptoms.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the big
lies about homeopathy,

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are no
negative effects.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.960 align:middle line:90%
We've kept that secret.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.767 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't been
talked about a lot.

00:44:25.767 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:84%
If you take the wrong
remedies, you're

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:84%
giving the wrong
information, or if you're

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:90%
misusing the information.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you don't
want to get off caffeine,

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you need a physiological
way of getting off caffeine

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.270 align:middle line:90%
to replace it.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have to find out
why you need the caffeine.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
A little caffeine
is very healthy.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.580 align:middle line:84%
For 20% of people,
it's very healthy.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:90%
40% of people, it's neutral.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.210 align:middle line:90%
40% of people, it's a disaster.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
individuality here.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:57.185 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So if something is
not working for you,

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:84%
usually if people are
dependent on caffeine,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.250 align:middle line:84%
they're usually in at least the
alarm or the resistance stage

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.070 align:middle line:90%
of a stress condition.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.436 align:middle line:84%
Maybe malfunctioning
adrenals at this point,

00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:12.435 align:middle line:84%
and some other things not
having proper outputs?

00:45:12.435 --> 00:45:13.535 align:middle line:90%
>> And sugar outputs.

00:45:13.535 --> 00:45:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Sugar outputs, yeah.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Which leads me to the
subject of diabetes.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:18.575 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming an epidemic.

00:45:18.575 --> 00:45:19.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we're having an
epidemic of chronic disease.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:90%
People are stressed.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The more stressed you
are, the more sugar.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The more sugar you
eat, the more you

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:35.930 align:middle line:84%
get cortisol resistance,
which is the sugar pump.

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
insulin resistance,

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.560 align:middle line:90%
which is the sugar injector.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're islets of Langerhans
in your pancreas put

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:84%
out the insulin, which takes it
into the cell from the blood.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you're eating
processed foods,

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.700 align:middle line:84%
you're overwhelming
the system by having

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.340 align:middle line:90%
too much sugar in your blood.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Your body can only store
a teaspoon of sugar

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:84%
in the form of glycogen. The
rest has to be stored as fat.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot
of triglycerides

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that are stored in
your body, and you

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:84%
can measure them in the blood
in response to this resistance.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And once you get
that resistance,

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:90%
you're heading towards diabetes.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And now because we're in
a generation of people where

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.010 align:middle line:84%
it's become so dominant,
even among children--

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --now we're looking at having
second-generational effects

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:90%
down the road, right?

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Through this epigenetic
process you're talking about.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:34.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, MIT is predicting
within a decade,

00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:36.250 align:middle line:84%
a decade and a half, we'll
have so many disabled,

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.020 align:middle line:84%
chronically ill people that the
system won't be able to handle

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.820 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Within a decade.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Decade and a half.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Decade and a half.

00:46:42.435 --> 00:46:43.345 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 to 15 years.

00:46:43.345 --> 00:46:44.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:46:44.145 --> 00:46:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there's ways to keep
them alive but not to keep them

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.490 align:middle line:90%
functioning.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And the more we feed
people non-foods--

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, food has
always been expensive.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the way it is.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's labor-intensive,
and it's real food.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So coming up with a
system of artificial food

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and calling it food--

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.517 align:middle line:90%
what's the body's message ?

00:47:07.517 --> 00:47:08.600 align:middle line:90%
I got to store everything.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm starving.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can get
more and more obese.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the obesity
becomes the endocrine organ

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.880 align:middle line:84%
of inflammation, which
eventually destroys the organs.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.230 align:middle line:90%
And you become chronically ill.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So most of the chronic diseases
have an inflammatory component,

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.040 align:middle line:90%
including cancer.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And so without the
lifestyle change and society--

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.505 align:middle line:90%
>> And the spiritual.

00:47:39.505 --> 00:47:41.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you can't
get to the spiritual--

00:47:41.815 --> 00:47:42.815 align:middle line:90%
>> When you're that ill.

00:47:42.815 --> 00:47:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --when you're suffering.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That is true, you cannot.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't reach
up into yourself.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the first motive
of a healer is to relieve

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:90%
the suffering.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And you only can relieve what
you've gone through yourself.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a great
doctor, Randall Stone, who

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.610 align:middle line:84%
said, the doctor can
only believe what he can

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:01.780 align:middle line:90%
he can conceive.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:03.522 --> 00:48:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people are
desperate to be something

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.480 align:middle line:84%
they're not, so they become
part of something that

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.090 align:middle line:90%
doesn't actually exist.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're desperate
to be part of a community,

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.410 align:middle line:84%
or a family, an extended
family that no longer exists.

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Or to be admired.

00:48:18.265 --> 00:48:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And to be admired.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>> To be looked at.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we have, as you
say, as a result of it,

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.950 align:middle line:84%
this dominance of
estrogen. We have

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.917 align:middle line:84%
these fear-driven chemicals
that are pumping out,

00:48:29.917 --> 00:48:32.500 align:middle line:84%
creating these conditions where
we've got to have more coffee,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.970 align:middle line:84%
we've got to have
more sugar just

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.740 align:middle line:84%
to get through the next hour
and calm our nerves down, right?

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.065 align:middle line:90%
>> And now we're into diabetes.

00:48:39.065 --> 00:48:39.865 align:middle line:90%
Jesus, what a mess.

00:48:39.865 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have to have
unhealthy relationships.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.700 align:middle line:90%
We have to look a certain way.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.640 align:middle line:84%
We have to be everything
possible to be something

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.960 align:middle line:90%
that we're not.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And who came up with that idea?

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:52.735 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:48:52.735 --> 00:48:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kept us just sort
of paranoid as a species,

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:84%
certainly uncomfortable
with ourselves.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's made us more
violent than we need to be.

00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I had a
teacher that's passed on.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.620 align:middle line:84%
He was an interesting
combination.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.770 align:middle line:84%
He was a patient of mine,
he was a teacher of mine,

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and a friend of mine.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And he always said that
if somebody doesn't

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.622 align:middle line:84%
love somebody
else's children, you

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.830 align:middle line:84%
can't convince him that they
actually love their own.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:49:22.057 --> 00:49:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you think
about that, it's true.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody is
somebody else's children.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And whoever came
up with the idea

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that you can have
suffering children

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and your own children
can be happy?

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So you see a lot
of people that are

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.870 align:middle line:84%
so discontented
with their own lives

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and they think
something is missing.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It's because there's
such an imbalance

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.440 align:middle line:90%
in how we treat each other.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have opulence
and you have starvation.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.296 align:middle line:84%
It's not a manageable
way of living.

00:49:54.296 --> 00:49:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet on some level--
well, as we see evidence

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:03.960 align:middle line:84%
of, simultaneously, many people
are beginning to understand

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.760 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And making much more
conscious choices as to how

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:10.347 align:middle line:90%
they choose to live their lives.

00:50:10.347 --> 00:50:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing--
and I've said this

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:13.790 align:middle line:84%
before in little
commentaries and such--

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that we have some issues with
the economy going on right now.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.692 align:middle line:84%
A lot of kids in my son's
generation and younger,

00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:22.400 align:middle line:84%
they can't find jobs
to save their lives.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.044 align:middle line:90%
There's just nothing out there.

00:50:24.044 --> 00:50:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they're forced to
move home with the parents.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And the parents
are embarrassed,

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because their child didn't have
what it took to get out there

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and make it on their
own in the world.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And the child's thinking,
oh, I'm a loser.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
hallelujah, you all

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.990 align:middle line:90%
get to live together again.

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And work it out,
help each other.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Support each other
however you can.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.214 align:middle line:84%
I mean, each
generation, each person

00:50:48.214 --> 00:50:50.005 align:middle line:84%
has something beautiful
to offer the group.

00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And heal the
wounds of childhood.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And heal the
wounds of childhood.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I just see it as the most
beautiful opportunity

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that people are being forced
to live together again

00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.715 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:50:58.715 --> 00:51:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautifully said.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you 100% in
that we have to come--

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:09.242 align:middle line:84%
the change that's happening
in the environment,

00:51:09.242 --> 00:51:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and change that's
going to happen--

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:90%
it's going to accelerate.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're having a
rapid change ahead of us,

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:84%
not only economically,
but climate-wise and

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:90%
environmentally.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be living
in a time of limited resources.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Now is that a bad
thing or a good thing?

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Can you mitigate that?

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you adapt to that?

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.690 align:middle line:90%
The there's some benefit there.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Because then we begin to
recognize that each one of us

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:37.670 align:middle line:90%
are interdependent.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.140 align:middle line:84%
None of us can
live in isolation.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.602 align:middle line:84%
And that we either nurture
each other or we deteriorate.

00:51:43.602 --> 00:51:45.560 align:middle line:84%
When we talked about
earlier-- the six things--

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.110 align:middle line:84%
the nurturing is one
of the six things.

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:90%
You have to be touched.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.350 align:middle line:90%
You have to be cared for.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to be
loved unconditionally.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants to be happy.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.064 align:middle line:84%
Everybody doesn't
want to suffer.

00:51:57.064 --> 00:51:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the beauty when
you watch primates with each

00:51:59.480 --> 00:51:59.750 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> They're always
touching each other.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> They're always
touching each other.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Caring for each other.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:04.874 align:middle line:84%
>> But some of them
can be very violent.

00:52:04.874 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they've
got their issues.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you
just see natively,

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.820 align:middle line:84%
touch is a big part of
the primate community.

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, on nerves, you do not
put out enough brain-derived

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:84%
neurotrophic factor
without tough.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.365 align:middle line:90%
That's a signaling capacity.

00:52:21.365 --> 00:52:23.142 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:52:23.142 --> 00:52:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to get
personal for a minute here,

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need to
spend a lot of time on it.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:27.995 align:middle line:90%
>> We can.

00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> My body doesn't
create cortisol.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It creates virtually none, so
I've been going through life

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:90%
in a peculiar kind of way.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But when I go into a cortisol
crash absence crisis, which

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.620 align:middle line:84%
has happened many, many times,
I learned, as the years went on,

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that if someone will
touch the back of my neck

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:84%
or hold my feet, I can
avoid a trip to the ER

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.079 align:middle line:84%
just by having that human energy
interacting with my energy.

00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:56.120 align:middle line:90%
What's actually going on?

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.911 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I might have
already shot myself up

00:52:57.911 --> 00:52:59.600 align:middle line:84%
with a little
cortisol or whatever.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's a severe situation
in which I could die,

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and human touch can actually
prevent it from deteriorating.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.610 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, oxytocin.

00:53:09.526 --> 00:53:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the body starts creating
oxytocin and says you're safe?

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> To counteract the--

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.200 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And it starts, then it
controls the other systems

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of the body so you don't
go don't go into shock any

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:19.270 align:middle line:90%
further?

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It overrides the
lack of cortisol.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:24.502 --> 00:53:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And so on a minor level--

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's an extreme
level-- but on a minor level,

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.670 align:middle line:84%
in our touching each
other, this is what

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:90%
it's doing for us all the time.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So the key one for you
would be progesterone,

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.730 align:middle line:84%
because progesterone is
a precursor to cortisol.

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, so what you
were saying earlier--

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.350 align:middle line:90%
coming back to all of this--

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:52.620 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like the word
values have to be renegotiated

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and at the core of everything
you're talking about.

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things that you

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:03.330 align:middle line:84%
notice in life sometimes, you
learn things from surprises.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd say 95% of what I've learned
came from either students

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.060 align:middle line:90%
or patients.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come from
academic learning,

00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.071 align:middle line:84%
even though I like
academic learning.

00:54:13.071 --> 00:54:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But it came from just
listening to people.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I've learned to listen
very carefully about them.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
is, I had a patient who

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:27.090 align:middle line:84%
was a professor at Stanford
of German literature.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And she had this horrible fear,
because of something horrible

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.090 align:middle line:84%
happened to her,
where she was brutally

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:84%
raped by a neighbor who
got off on a technicality.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.390 align:middle line:84%
The police didn't
do it correctly.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And he moved back as a neighbor.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, jeez.

00:54:43.515 --> 00:54:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what a disaster.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Till she finally had
enough sense to leave.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.387 align:middle line:84%
And she came to
me for homeopathy.

00:54:52.387 --> 00:54:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
give her homeopathy,

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and it changed her
life, that fear.

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And so she decided
to study homeopathy.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.700 align:middle line:90%
She was fluent in German.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.410 align:middle line:84%
She was a professor
of German literature,

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.790 align:middle line:90%
she actually taught in German.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Even though she was
originally from America,

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.990 align:middle line:90%
she had taught in Germany also.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And she called me up.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:14.260 align:middle line:84%
She was now teaching
in the Midwest

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:84%
at one of the
universities there.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do you know
the philosophy of homeopathy

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:25.290 align:middle line:90%
is actually Hegelian dialectics?

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I
don't think there's

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.210 align:middle line:84%
a homeopath in the
world would know that.

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.149 align:middle line:84%
And he said that was the
primary philosophy of Germany

00:55:32.149 --> 00:55:33.190 align:middle line:90%
at the time of Hahnemann.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And basically, Hegelian
dialectics is that you

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.410 align:middle line:84%
deconstruct a thought you
have, a belief that you have.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Because beliefs come when
you don't know something.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Delusions come when you
don't know something.

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So when to get to what you know,
you have to get to the core.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So you take it apart
till you get to the core.

00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's the basis of
homeopathic medicine,

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is getting some
signal that touches

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.080 align:middle line:84%
the core of who you are so
you can begin to recalibrate

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.240 align:middle line:84%
yourself, whether
it's using nutrition,

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it's using medicines,
whether it's using homeopathy,

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:19.170 align:middle line:90%
or connections in life.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:22.020 align:middle line:84%
You get drawn to what is
necessary to recalibrate

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.910 align:middle line:84%
yourself to get
you back to center

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:29.250 align:middle line:84%
so you can have an authentic
life that gives you not only

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.220 align:middle line:84%
pleasure, but gives you
purpose and meaning,

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and allows you to be a full
human being on this planet.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a rare
opportunity for somebody

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to have these type
of experiences.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.280 align:middle line:90%
You have the unique conditions.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And here on Earth, these
are unique conditions,

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.870 align:middle line:84%
where you have the
limits of physicality,

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:51.510 align:middle line:84%
but you have the
limitless possibilities

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:54.546 align:middle line:90%
of unique expression.

00:56:54.546 --> 00:56:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautifully put.

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Anything else you'd like to say?

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520 align:middle line:90%
We're about out of tape.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.780 align:middle line:90%
That was lovely.

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wish everybody
a peace and calmness,

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and a pleasant
journey through life.

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't found your
center, or you need healing,

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:12.420 align:middle line:90%
never give up.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
solutions out there.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And anything you can do to
mitigate your suffering,

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.500 align:middle line:84%
the suffering can be converted
into fertilizer, and soul

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.210 align:middle line:90%
growth, and spiritual growth.

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.325 align:middle line:84%
>> On that, I'm so glad my
friend Susan told me about you.

00:57:30.325 --> 00:57:31.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:32.745 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a pleasure.

00:57:32.745 --> 00:57:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Good questions.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a tremendous amount
of food for thought in this

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.420 align:middle line:84%
interview, meaning you may
want to watch it a few times.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It certainly shows
us what has been

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.590 align:middle line:84%
lost in the isolation
of modern life,

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:47.645 align:middle line:84%
where families have
dissipated, and touch

00:57:47.645 --> 00:57:50.840 align:middle line:84%
has become viewed as
touchy-feely nonsense.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I intend to
continue my conversations

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.130 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Cohen in the future.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks
for watching CMN.
