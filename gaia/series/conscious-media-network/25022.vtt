00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:03.010 line:15% 
<v ->Many of the boomer generation of Americans grew up</v>

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.210 line:15% 
with a television program called The Phil Silvers Show.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.442 line:15% 
This caustic, zany TV character was also a husband

4
00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:13.288 line:15% 
and a father, and today his daughter, Candace Silvers,

5
00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.083 line:15% 
credits her dad with giving her the insights needed

6
00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:19.458 line:15% 
to grow into her role as a motivational trainer and teacher.

7
00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:22.100 line:15% 
Never having left Hollywood, Candace also speaks

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.829 line:15% 
to the responsibility to motion picture industry has

9
00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.613 line:15% 
to a world struggling to deal with rapid change and stress.

10
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.521 line:15% 
(gentle music)

11
00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:41.819 line:15% 
Candace, you have a very interesting lineage,

12
00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:44.816 line:15% 
and you've continued to develop yourself

13
00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:47.462 line:15% 
throughout your entire lifetime doing exquisite work now,

14
00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:50.181 line:15% 
but I'd like to take it back to when you were very young

15
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:52.447 line:15% 
and you were under the influence of your father,

16
00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:54.427 line:15% 
Phil Silvers, who was an icon.

17
00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:57.638 line:15% 
I don't know anyone who didn't love your father.

18
00:00:57.638 --> 00:00:59.000 line:15% 
<v ->Thank you, me too.
<v Regina>And he was a part</v>

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.207 line:15% 
of our lives.
(Candace laughs)

20
00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:02.298 line:15% 
And yet, when we were talking off camera,

21
00:01:02.298 --> 00:01:04.453 line:15% 
you were saying what people probably don't know.

22
00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:06.831 line:15% 
Your dad had an incredible intellect,

23
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.519 line:15% 
and in a certain way was his own yogi.

24
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.908 line:15% 
Can you tell us a little bit about your dad?

25
00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.258 line:15% 
<v ->He was one of the most amazing men.</v>

26
00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.153 line:15% 
Unfortunately, he passed when I was 25,

27
00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:21.999 line:15% 
but in the gift of my world,

28
00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.182 line:15% 
he never really passed, right?

29
00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:25.155 line:15% 
'Cause you turn the TV on and there he is,

30
00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.662 line:15% 
and you hear someone speaking about him and you open a book,

31
00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:30.083 line:15% 
and so he's never really died for me.

32
00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:34.785 line:15% 
His body dropped, but he's fully still present in here.

33
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.647 line:15% 
<v Regina>And obviously a lot of what you are,</v>

34
00:01:36.647 --> 00:01:38.876 line:15% 
what you pass on, is because of the tradition

35
00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:41.244 line:15% 
of what you absorbed being around him.

36
00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:42.460 line:15% 
I mean, he wasn't just,

37
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.985 line:15% 
he was hanging out with some heavyweights.

38
00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:44.827
<v ->Oh, he was.</v>

39
00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:47.174 line:15% 
When Frank Sinatra and he were best friends

40
00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:51.196 line:15% 
for 35 years they entertained World War II, the troops.

41
00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:53.160 line:15% 
<v Regina>And politicians.</v>

42
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.062 line:15% 
<v ->Kennedy and the pope, and yes, cardinals.</v>

43
00:01:57.062 --> 00:01:59.590 line:15% 
And he was a very serious Jewish man

44
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.627 line:15% 
who transcended all religion

45
00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:05.032 line:15% 
you know, back in the 50s, 60s.

46
00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:08.560 line:15% 
He loved intellectual, intelligent

47
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.863 line:15% 
heartfelt, true people.

48
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.972 line:15% 
Not the right thing to do.

49
00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:17.570 line:15% 
And I think part of the transcended the dimensions

50
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.802 line:15% 
in which he played in and why he was able to do things

51
00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:24.123 line:15% 
that we saw that we didn't necessarily understand.

52
00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.392 line:15% 
I think one of the greatest gifts that he ever gave me

53
00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:29.359 line:15% 
was that Bilko would be on,

54
00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.559 line:15% 
and he would be standing next to me,

55
00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:32.655 line:15% 
and Bilko would be on,

56
00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:33.657 line:15% 
and he'd be standing next to me,

57
00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:34.585 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)
and I would look, and

58
00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:36.482 line:15% 
and there was no difference.
^- [Regina] Yeah.

59
00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.585 line:15% 
<v ->And I think at two, three, four, five years old,</v>

60
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:41.605 line:15% 
I lost--

61
00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:43.295 line:15% 
I lost other as true.

62
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.896 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Candace>I saw there</v>

63
00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:45.374 line:15% 
as here.

64
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.541 line:15% 
There was no he was here and then he was there.

65
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:49.147 line:15% 
He was in both places at the same time

66
00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:50.436 line:15% 
and they were both true.

67
00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:53.297 line:15% 
And they were both integral and they were both connected.

68
00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:55.554 line:15% 
And I think he did that for a lot of people,

69
00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:58.137 line:15% 
whether they know it or not.

70
00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:02.231 line:15% 
We get calls on our website all the time.

71
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.831 line:15% 
Not calls, I'm sorry, I'm old-fashioned,

72
00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:06.605 line:15% 
but we get emails on our website all the time

73
00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:09.925 line:15% 
of people saying, "I was in the hospital in the 50s

74
00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:12.471 line:15% 
"and I was so sick and I used to laugh

75
00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:14.817 line:15% 
"and laugh and laugh with your father,

76
00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:18.646 line:15% 
"and years later we find out about laugh therapy,

77
00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.342 line:15% 
"and here I was in the practice of that,

78
00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:22.262 line:15% 
"and I wanna thank you for my health."

79
00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:26.699 line:15% 
And to my father, who's passed 25 years ago--

80
00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:27.467 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

81
00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.088 line:15% 
<v ->The difference he's still making.</v>

82
00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:30.145 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

83
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.191 line:15% 
What's interesting is that because of the work you do now,

84
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:39.775 line:15% 
and oftentimes you're assisting the evolution

85
00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:43.950 line:15% 
of people in the television and the film industry.

86
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.727 line:15% 
Because this is a bit of your roots as well, do you,

87
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.652 line:15% 
and I wanna get into the psychology of this,

88
00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:51.745 line:15% 
because people who perceive themselves on the outside

89
00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:55.178 line:15% 
with their nose pressed against the window see that life,

90
00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:57.747 line:15% 
that life in Hollywood in particular,

91
00:03:57.747 --> 00:04:01.006 line:15% 
as something that's blessed with a different type of being

92
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.118 line:15% 
than exists in the rest of the world.

93
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.328 line:15% 
What did you experience as first a child

94
00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:09.091 line:15% 
and now as an adult reflecting back on that?

95
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.372 line:15% 
In terms of what that world truly was,

96
00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:14.516 line:15% 
in terms of what made anyone any different,

97
00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:16.619 line:15% 
or was there any difference?

98
00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.682 line:15% 
<v ->That would be like asking a plumber's daughter</v>

99
00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:20.909 line:15% 
what his father was like.

100
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.044 line:15% 
I don't know the difference.

101
00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:25.745 line:15% 
I can't tell you how my life was different from your life

102
00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:28.100 line:15% 
or their life, because it's all I knew.

103
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.242 line:15% 
I do know that

104
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.757 line:15% 
at once it was the church

105
00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:36.203 line:15% 
that everyone believed in and looked to

106
00:04:36.203 --> 00:04:39.520 line:15% 
and bowed at and gave their money to and their faith in.

107
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.950 line:15% 
And then that was kind of moved to

108
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.585 line:15% 
the crown and the palace and royalty

109
00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:49.126 line:15% 
and we looked to that.

110
00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.771 line:15% 
And that was where we could put our faith and listen

111
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:54.096 line:15% 
and when they spoke hear our future and our safety.

112
00:04:54.096 --> 00:04:56.986 line:15% 
And then that sort of passed.

113
00:04:56.986 --> 00:04:58.143 line:15% 
And then science is now this you know,

114
00:04:58.143 --> 00:05:02.099 line:15% 
"If science say it's so, then it must be so."

115
00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.988 line:15% 
And right now in our day and age,

116
00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:08.497 line:15% 
I believe that where people are moving toward

117
00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:12.101 line:15% 
and feeling truth is an actors.

118
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:15.046 line:15% 
Not only the making of a film that can bring a voice

119
00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:18.569 line:15% 
to something that politics doesn't have the

120
00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:20.148 line:15% 
<v Candace>pull on anymore.</v>
<v Regina>The emotion.</v>

121
00:05:20.148 --> 00:05:21.055 line:15% 
<v Regina>It doesn't have the credibility,</v>

122
00:05:21.055 --> 00:05:23.319 line:15% 
nor the emotional pull.

123
00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.212 line:15% 
<v Candace>I think both, but the credibility's what</v>

124
00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:29.053 line:15% 
I'm speaking about right now in this field, in this realm,

125
00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:32.423 line:15% 
is that we're hearing messages.

126
00:05:32.423 --> 00:05:35.281 line:15% 
Whether it's on OCD in As Good As It Gets,

127
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:38.481 line:15% 
or it's Crazy Heart and the plight of a human being

128
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:40.476 line:15% 
that's not other and different and out there,

129
00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:42.705 line:15% 
but a human being in the path of his life

130
00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:44.845 line:15% 
and the journey that that is.

131
00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.593 line:15% 
Then there's the second part to that,

132
00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:50.617 line:15% 
which is the individual who's standing inside,

133
00:05:51.037 --> 00:05:53.959 line:15% 
the individual who's surrendered his life as his truth

134
00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.047 line:15% 
and this is the way I am,

135
00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:57.555 line:15% 
to stand inside of another human being,

136
00:05:57.555 --> 00:05:59.832 line:15% 
not act what he thinks, which is duality, right?

137
00:05:59.832 --> 00:06:02.851 line:15% 
I'm acting what I think, and then I'm doing it to get paid,

138
00:06:02.851 --> 00:06:04.312 line:15% 
which is a double duality.

139
00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:06.755 line:15% 
So I'm even less here and with each box

140
00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:10.189 line:15% 
of shift to the next, I'm acting what I think

141
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.493 line:15% 
and I'm doing it to get paid, I'm even less here,

142
00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:14.765 line:15% 
because there's more split in the mind of what I'm

143
00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.805 line:15% 
taking responsibility for while I'm here speaking.

144
00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:22.639 line:15% 
So, as we are able to see these people standing,

145
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.118 line:15% 
whether it's Robert Downey Jr. or Leonardo DiCaprio,

146
00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:29.561 line:15% 
that these people are absolutely standing

147
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:30.649 line:15% 
inside of an activity,

148
00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:34.924 line:15% 
or Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man,

149
00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:37.206 line:15% 
and we're watching them experience them self back.

150
00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:40.103 line:15% 
No one can tell us that's not true.

151
00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:43.072 line:15% 
<v Regina>Because that is true for each one of us,</v>

152
00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:45.186 line:15% 
or we wouldn't be going and relating to these films.

153
00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:47.135 line:15% 
<v  Candace>Well, we can feel</v>
<v Regina>There's some aspect</v>

154
00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:48.135 line:15% 
<v  Candace>ourselves back</v>
<v Regina>that's bringing our</v>

155
00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:48.640 line:15% 
<v Regina>It's reflecting</v>

156
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.920
<v Regina>something back.</v>
<v Candace>Absolutely.</v>

157
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.770 line:15% 
<v ->It's not dimensional anymore</v>

158
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.882 line:15% 
where someone else is telling us to believe it.

159
00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.032 line:15% 
We're having a direct experience,

160
00:06:57.032 --> 00:06:57.976 line:15% 
and we're having the direct experience

161
00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:00.327 line:15% 
because the actor's having a direct experience,

162
00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:03.582 line:15% 
and there's so few of them that can actually do it.

163
00:07:03.582 --> 00:07:06.206 line:15% 
My father, which is what started this conversation, was,

164
00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:09.734 line:15% 
only way back in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s,

165
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:13.013 line:15% 
that when he stood up,

166
00:07:13.013 --> 00:07:16.288 line:15% 
so did that with which he was standing in.

167
00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:17.930 line:15% 
So there was no part of his mind

168
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.138 line:15% 
that was remembering to do anything.

169
00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:21.599 line:15% 
He was fully available.

170
00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:24.650 line:15% 
I think that's what I grew up with.

171
00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.088 line:15% 
<v Regina>And so, when you're working with people now,</v>

172
00:07:27.088 --> 00:07:30.360 line:15% 
and let's talk about film as a

173
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.357 line:15% 
metaphysical tool for expansion, because it has a potential

174
00:07:33.357 --> 00:07:35.799 line:15% 
to take us in any direction.

175
00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:36.529 line:15% 
<v ->That's correct.</v>

176
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.276 line:15% 
<v Regina>The emotional body engages immediately with film</v>

177
00:07:39.276 --> 00:07:41.210 line:15% 
<v Regina>when you watch a drama.</v>
<v Candace>It's visceral.</v>

178
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.937 line:15% 
<v Regina>It's visceral. And, I mean</v>
<v Candace>Yes.</v>

179
00:07:43.937 --> 00:07:45.958 line:15% 
<v Regina>I'm sure a number of people watching this</v>

180
00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.983 line:15% 
right now would say when are they gonna up the act

181
00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:52.213 line:15% 
a little bit more and get rid of some of the violence,

182
00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:54.975 line:15% 
some of the lower older paradigm stuff?

183
00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:55.980 line:15% 
<v Regina>It sells.</v>
<v Candace>Well, it's to get</v>

184
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Candace>people in the theater</v>

185
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.152 line:15% 
<v Candace>unfortunately.</v>
<v Regina>It is to get people</v>

186
00:07:58.152 --> 00:07:59.152 line:15% 
<v ->Candace] It's money drawn.
<v Regina>in--</v>

187
00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:01.596 line:15% 
<v Candace>and we're moving out of money, property</v>

188
00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:02.970 line:15% 
and prestige as what motivates us.

189
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.669 line:15% 
When we lost real estate in the stock market

190
00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.260 line:15% 
as we're gonna grow old and this is gonna take care of us,

191
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.052 line:15% 
so when we get there it'll all work out.

192
00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:12.604 line:15% 
Well, there is no "there" anymore.

193
00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:15.601 line:15% 
It's been wiped from our memories and our future.

194
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:16.483 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

195
00:08:16.483 --> 00:08:18.356 line:15% 
<v ->So now the activity,</v>

196
00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:21.558 line:15% 
the game that we're playing, has a lot to do

197
00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:25.433 line:15% 
with being here, being in the process of what's occurred.

198
00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:28.615 line:15% 
So what drives us and draws us anymore, people can't say.

199
00:08:28.615 --> 00:08:29.983 line:15% 
They can't sell us products that are gonna

200
00:08:29.983 --> 00:08:31.092 line:15% 
help us in the future because

201
00:08:31.092 --> 00:08:32.671 line:15% 
we're not buying that anymore.

202
00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:33.738 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Candace>We're not buying</v>

203
00:08:33.738 --> 00:08:34.644 line:15% 
<v ->into the belief system.</v>

204
00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:36.863 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's very true, and at the same time,</v>

205
00:08:36.863 --> 00:08:39.693 line:15% 
when the economy sinks, as it currently is doing,

206
00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:41.023 line:15% 
<v Candace>Yay!</v>
<v Regina>as in the past</v>

207
00:08:41.023 --> 00:08:42.466 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah. Yes, I'm with you.</v>

208
00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:44.086 line:15% 
<v ->You go. (laughing)</v>

209
00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:45.336 line:15% 
<v Regina>At the same time--</v>
<v Candace>Well it's all</v>

210
00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:46.516 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah</v>
<v Candace>second chakra</v>

211
00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:46.766 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes, all second chakra.</v>

212
00:08:46.766 --> 00:08:47.675 line:15% 
And at the same time,

213
00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:50.733 line:15% 
because people are left with very little other options,

214
00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:52.898 line:15% 
entertainment becomes even more important.

215
00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:53.612 line:15% 
<v ->Always has been.</v>

216
00:08:53.612 --> 00:08:54.585 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Candace>Whenever someone's</v>

217
00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:56.752 line:15% 
depressed, a distraction is necessary.

218
00:08:56.752 --> 00:09:00.890 line:15% 
And when people are too healthy to go to drugs or whatever,

219
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.108 line:15% 
workaholism,

220
00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:05.337 line:15% 
some distraction that's not healthy

221
00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.566 line:15% 
for balance, and balance is what's becoming healthy

222
00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:10.073 line:15% 
in our world today, not looking young, but balance,

223
00:09:10.073 --> 00:09:13.476 line:15% 
being healthy and fit

224
00:09:13.476 --> 00:09:15.861 line:15% 
in one's self, not in the way you look.

225
00:09:15.861 --> 00:09:18.432 line:15% 
That people are drawn to a distraction,

226
00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:19.648 line:15% 
and that's a healthy distraction,

227
00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:22.822 line:15% 
because not only are you going to the movies

228
00:09:22.822 --> 00:09:24.910 line:15% 
to distract, but you're learning.

229
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.024 line:15% 
And not only are you learning,

230
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:29.576 line:15% 
you're learning when you're at a weakened state.

231
00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:32.414 line:15% 
So the learning is deeper and more whole.

232
00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:35.097 line:15% 
That what you choose to go see,

233
00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:38.144 line:15% 
whether it's sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll,

234
00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.604 line:15% 
not that that's a bad thing,

235
00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:42.038 line:15% 
but together as one to pull you outside of yourself,

236
00:09:42.038 --> 00:09:44.566 line:15% 
or your drawn to it's A Beautiful Mind,

237
00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:46.864 line:15% 
or something that's teaching you something.

238
00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:49.163 line:15% 
And when you're drawn into these movies

239
00:09:49.163 --> 00:09:52.474 line:15% 
that are made badly,

240
00:09:52.757 --> 00:09:53.877 line:15% 
not that they mean to,

241
00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:57.034 line:15% 
but, right, money took their attention, not their heart

242
00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.122 line:15% 
and not their passion.

243
00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:01.341 line:15% 
I teach people passion is to pass one's self on,

244
00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:05.395 line:15% 
pass, P-A-S-S-I, me, on, O-N,

245
00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:06.641 line:15% 
so to pass yourself on.

246
00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:09.473 line:15% 
When someone is in that activity in our day and age,

247
00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:11.776 line:15% 
it's my opinion that you can't fail,

248
00:10:11.776 --> 00:10:13.352 line:15% 
because we're not looking to get anywhere anymore,

249
00:10:13.352 --> 00:10:15.517 line:15% 
so there's no activity of where we needed to be.

250
00:10:15.517 --> 00:10:17.617 line:15% 
There's the act of the process.

251
00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:21.408 line:15% 
And the process in itself is where miracles are born,

252
00:10:21.408 --> 00:10:22.475 line:15% 
and the more--
<v Regina>That presence.</v>

253
00:10:22.475 --> 00:10:23.499 line:15% 
<v Candace>That presence.</v>

254
00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:27.285 line:15% 
The more present you are,

255
00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:28.885 line:15% 
the more energy you can draw.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

256
00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:31.114 line:15% 
<v Candace>So in this movies,</v>

257
00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:34.029 line:15% 
we could name so many of them,

258
00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:35.084 line:15% 
we are learning.

259
00:10:35.084 --> 00:10:36.359 line:15% 
We're learning,

260
00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:38.012 line:15% 
and when we're learning, we're receptive,

261
00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.578 line:15% 
and when we're receptive, we're open.

262
00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:44.775 line:15% 
So these actors in this day and age are taking on a really

263
00:10:44.775 --> 00:10:47.740 line:15% 
dangerous and really powerful stance,

264
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.135 line:15% 
because if they're not telling the truth--

265
00:10:51.065 --> 00:10:52.436 line:15% 
Think about it, everybody wants to be an actor,

266
00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:53.972 line:15% 
but all you have to do is make one mistake

267
00:10:53.972 --> 00:10:55.572 line:15% 
and they will slash you down.

268
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.308 line:15% 
And who's they?

269
00:10:56.308 --> 00:10:58.494 line:15% 
The feelers that are out there saying, "Give me the truth."

270
00:10:59.324 --> 00:11:01.583 line:15% 
And the people that are,

271
00:11:01.583 --> 00:11:02.628 line:15% 
well, they're falling in by accident.

272
00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.484 line:15% 
No one's saying, "Let me go an stand naked in front

273
00:11:04.484 --> 00:11:06.942 line:15% 
"of the camera and show them the things I can show,"

274
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.981 line:15% 
But they start to get addicted to being present.

275
00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:12.560 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Candace>And to taking on,</v>

276
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.591 line:15% 
reincarnating themselves while still in this body.

277
00:11:14.597 --> 00:11:15.488 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Candace>To getting to</v>

278
00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:17.407 line:15% 
<v ->play a bigger life while still here.</v>

279
00:11:17.407 --> 00:11:18.666 line:15% 
Their lives are altered.

280
00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:21.727 line:15% 
Think of Julia Roberts in, what was it called?

281
00:11:21.727 --> 00:11:22.932 line:15% 
Notting--

282
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:23.465 line:15% 
<v Regina>Notting Hill.</v>

283
00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:24.447 line:15% 
<v ->Notting Hill,</v>

284
00:11:24.447 --> 00:11:26.719 line:15% 
where it's the boy in the bookstore

285
00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:27.646 line:15% 
that she falls in love with,

286
00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:29.641 line:15% 
and next thing you know she's happily married

287
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:30.616 line:15% 
to a cameraman.

288
00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.941 line:15% 
So did the film change her?

289
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:34.653 line:15% 
Did she change the film?

290
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.685 line:15% 
Did the film that she was transcending through

291
00:11:36.685 --> 00:11:39.405 line:15% 
alter the world and did the world see something?

292
00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:42.264 line:15% 
So it begins to be like a kaleidoscope, the box opens,

293
00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:43.981 line:15% 
or a diamond with all the facets.

294
00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:46.178 line:15% 
It's open up, and there's the sixth dimension.

295
00:11:46.178 --> 00:11:48.735 line:15% 
There's a whole other coming out of it.

296
00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:52.691 line:15% 
So people are getting to experience themselves back

297
00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:54.082 line:15% 
from these pioneers.

298
00:11:54.082 --> 00:11:56.407 line:15% 
<v Regina>From these idealized, in a lot of cases,</v>

299
00:11:56.407 --> 00:11:59.308 line:15% 
either villainized or idealized roles,

300
00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:01.441 line:15% 
we're seeing those aspects of ourself.

301
00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:04.321 line:15% 
And now, you know people in the film industry, obviously.

302
00:12:05.511 --> 00:12:09.057 line:15% 
From what you have been able to perceive,

303
00:12:10.847 --> 00:12:12.370 line:15% 
how many of the, not how many,

304
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.271 line:15% 
but how often is it that the actors are coming

305
00:12:15.271 --> 00:12:16.572 line:15% 
from that really high place

306
00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:19.249 line:15% 
with the sense of genuine responsibility?

307
00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:20.102 line:15% 
<v ->Not very often.</v>

308
00:12:20.102 --> 00:12:21.222 line:15% 
Not very often.

309
00:12:21.222 --> 00:12:23.100 line:15% 
But the ones that are, we know their names.

310
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.633 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

311
00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:25.393 line:15% 
<v ->And we may not know why.</v>

312
00:12:25.393 --> 00:12:27.515 line:15% 
We may not know what calls us back again,

313
00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:29.767 line:15% 
but we want to see that moment.

314
00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:31.069 line:15% 
We want to have that experience,

315
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:32.951 line:15% 
because when they're present, we're present.

316
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.199 line:15% 
They're thinking about their dirty laundry.

317
00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.577 line:15% 
We're thinking about our dirty laundry.

318
00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:37.742 line:15% 
They're worried whether the director likes them or not

319
00:12:37.742 --> 00:12:39.150 line:15% 
and they're gonna get fired,

320
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.835 line:15% 
then we're worried about our lives.

321
00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:43.304 line:15% 
When they're taking us on a journey,

322
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.829 line:15% 
it's because they're on the journey,

323
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.343 line:15% 
they're not telling us about it.

324
00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:49.769 line:15% 
Where in the 30s and 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s,

325
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.418 line:15% 
we were told what to do, how to believe,

326
00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:53.872 line:15% 
what to think, where to go,

327
00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:57.349 line:15% 
and if we were other, we were put in our place.

328
00:12:57.349 --> 00:12:59.219 line:15% 
We couldn't afford other.

329
00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:00.926 line:15% 
And now it's other that draws us.

330
00:13:01.099 --> 00:13:02.656 line:15% 
Now it's other that, "Ooh, that's interesting.

331
00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:04.470 line:15% 
"Let's go an investigate what that is,"

332
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.300 line:15% 
and the Christopher Columbuses of now,

333
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.593 line:15% 
and in all different dimensions, not in one area or arena.

334
00:13:10.593 --> 00:13:12.684 line:15% 
That's what's so brilliant about film,

335
00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:14.299 line:15% 
is it can take you anywhere.

336
00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.652 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well, I have to admit I'm a film junkie,</v>

337
00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:19.393 line:15% 
and I have been since I was probably five years old.

338
00:13:19.393 --> 00:13:22.625 line:15% 
I remember the very first films that I saw.

339
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:25.035 line:15% 
And Scott and I go to the movies at least once a week,

340
00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:26.987 line:15% 
and to a broad array of films,

341
00:13:26.987 --> 00:13:30.949 line:15% 
because there is that un--

342
00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:35.480 line:15% 
almost an unreachable aspect of self

343
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.422 line:15% 
that can be opened into another reality

344
00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:40.476 line:15% 
by allowing--
<v Candace>And you leave</v>

345
00:13:40.476 --> 00:13:41.266 line:15% 
feeling different.

346
00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:42.642 line:15% 
<v Regina>I leave feeling very different.</v>

347
00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:45.127 line:15% 
I mean, I'm more like a five year old still,

348
00:13:45.127 --> 00:13:46.076 line:15% 
(Candace laughs)
in that I really think,

349
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:48.305 line:15% 
(gasps) I think I'll become a ballerina now.

350
00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:50.396 line:15% 
That was so touching. (laughs)

351
00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:53.382 line:15% 
So I get truly like a child,
<v Candace>Yes.</v>

352
00:13:53.382 --> 00:13:55.217 line:15% 
<v Regina>sucked into the feelings of the movie,</v>

353
00:13:55.217 --> 00:13:57.953 line:15% 
and thus have to be responsible and careful

354
00:13:57.953 --> 00:13:59.888 line:15% 
about what I subject myself to as well.

355
00:13:59.888 --> 00:14:01.319 line:15% 
<v ->Oh, thank you for saying that.</v>

356
00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:03.540 line:15% 
I cannot go see a scary movie.
<v Regina>No.</v>

357
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.332 line:15% 
<v Candace>Because I don't have the difference</v>

358
00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:06.442 line:15% 
between real and not real, as I spoke

359
00:14:06.442 --> 00:14:07.191 line:15% 
about with my father.
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

360
00:14:07.191 --> 00:14:07.923 line:15% 
Nor do I.

361
00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:09.812 line:15% 
<v ->I will see things coming out of the walls,</v>

362
00:14:09.812 --> 00:14:11.135 line:15% 
and I know it's my mind,

363
00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:13.030 line:15% 
but I know that my mind is operating

364
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.194 line:15% 
when my intellect is going so I just don't go.

365
00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:17.165 line:15% 
I don't go to bars,

366
00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:19.533 line:15% 
and I don't go see things that I can't handle.

367
00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:20.951 line:15% 
You become more responsible

368
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:21.783 line:15% 
<v Regina>You do.</v>

369
00:14:21.783 --> 00:14:23.789 line:15% 
And you look at this, this is a quantum reality

370
00:14:23.789 --> 00:14:25.804 line:15% 
that has been created within ourselves

371
00:14:25.804 --> 00:14:27.461 line:15% 
as yet another field of potential,

372
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:28.376 line:15% 
<v Regina>isn't it?</v>
<v Candace>Isnt't that</v>

373
00:14:28.376 --> 00:14:29.823 line:15% 
<v Candace>beautiful.</v>

374
00:14:29.823 --> 00:14:33.030 line:15% 
I used to teach my foundation class just to actors,

375
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.976 line:15% 
writers, directors, editors, photographers,

376
00:14:34.976 --> 00:14:38.109 line:15% 
in our field, in the field that I specialize in.

377
00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:40.839 line:15% 
And only recently I've started teaching

378
00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.991 line:15% 
this class to anyone.

379
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:45.974 line:15% 
They say it's not just for actors anymore,

380
00:14:45.974 --> 00:14:50.710 line:15% 
in that it's true human behavior from the seed up,

381
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.145 line:15% 
the causation of how we come into being.

382
00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:56.963 line:15% 
And it's interesting that now, even in Iron Man,

383
00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:58.937 line:15% 
you see the triangle coming up in the middle

384
00:14:58.937 --> 00:15:00.515 line:15% 
of his emblem.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

385
00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:02.000 line:15% 
<v Candace>It's that we've made a mistake</v>

386
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.477 line:15% 
for so many hundreds of years in our world,

387
00:15:05.478 --> 00:15:07.113 line:15% 
in that we've had duality.

388
00:15:07.113 --> 00:15:10.682 line:15% 
We've had the box or the rectangle,

389
00:15:10.682 --> 00:15:12.581 line:15% 
and it's gone from one side to another.

390
00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:16.341 line:15% 
Even husband and wife or people in community,

391
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:18.773 line:15% 
it's been missing this third piece.

392
00:15:20.289 --> 00:15:21.711 line:15% 
So if you have one and then the other,

393
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:22.660 line:15% 
you have black and white

394
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.886 line:15% 
you have right and wrong,

395
00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:24.985 line:15% 
you have here and there, now and then.

396
00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:26.745 line:15% 
You have this third piece,

397
00:15:26.745 --> 00:15:29.998 line:15% 
and that third piece is actually sending you into a motion.

398
00:15:29.998 --> 00:15:34.188 line:15% 
That motion that comes into creation is causing

399
00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:35.915 line:15% 
time and space to alter itself

400
00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:37.707 line:15% 
from the viewer's point of view.

401
00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:38.326 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Candace>The manifestation</v>

402
00:15:38.326 --> 00:15:40.726 line:15% 
of the world is rising up out of,

403
00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:42.923 line:15% 
that you then can stand in that,

404
00:15:42.923 --> 00:15:46.317 line:15% 
take an action in that, and watch the world alter.

405
00:15:46.317 --> 00:15:48.466 line:15% 
This is what we're teaching people now.

406
00:15:48.466 --> 00:15:50.066 line:15% 
People are ready to learn this.

407
00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:53.756 line:15% 
For the last 25 years, I've taught it to actors

408
00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:57.798 line:15% 
who learned it under the premise

409
00:15:57.798 --> 00:16:00.282 line:15% 
of I'm stepping into a role,

410
00:16:00.282 --> 00:16:01.723 line:15% 
and now people are ready to actually see

411
00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:03.000 line:15% 
they're stepping into themselves,

412
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.278 line:15% 
into another dimension
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

413
00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:05.489 line:15% 
<v Candace>of here.</v>

414
00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:08.085 line:15% 
And it doesn't mean that this dimension goes away.

415
00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:10.916 line:15% 
It doesn't mean that we're now in la-la land.

416
00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:13.785 line:15% 
The mind wants to come in and identify it,

417
00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:16.451 line:15% 
and the mind is what takes it away.

418
00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:18.595 line:15% 
It's like if you look and you see the shadow,

419
00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:19.865 line:15% 
you see the shadow, you see the shadow,

420
00:16:19.865 --> 00:16:22.026 line:15% 
you see the shadow, you look and the shadow's gone.

421
00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:24.910 line:15% 
You say, "Oh, I thought that was a shadow."

422
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.040 line:15% 
So you look, "Oop," and that shadow's gone.

423
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.245 line:15% 
"Oop, that wasn't a shadow."

424
00:16:28.245 --> 00:16:30.591 line:15% 
But if you can train yourself in a process,

425
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:32.031 line:15% 
not by saying, "Don't do that!"

426
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:34.143 line:15% 
'cause anything you resist persists,

427
00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:36.959 line:15% 
but you can train yourself that when you see that shadow,

428
00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:39.908 line:15% 
know that you're seeing it not by your mind,

429
00:16:39.908 --> 00:16:43.179 line:15% 
therefore if you look with your mind, you lose yourself.

430
00:16:43.366 --> 00:16:44.689 line:15% 
You lose the shadow.

431
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:46.982 line:15% 
If you look with your being,

432
00:16:46.982 --> 00:16:50.192 line:15% 
the same thing that saw it originally,

433
00:16:50.192 --> 00:16:53.211 line:15% 
and you allow it to rise up and grow,

434
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.491 line:15% 
what you begin to get to see is

435
00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:57.428 line:15% 
that what's going on over there

436
00:16:57.428 --> 00:17:00.745 line:15% 
is true, real and here.

437
00:17:00.745 --> 00:17:03.422 line:15% 
It's just not what we've been trained in nursery school,

438
00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:05.923 line:15% 
kindergarten, and sixth grade to see with.

439
00:17:06.178 --> 00:17:08.638 line:15% 
So if you can view without looking,

440
00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:10.641 line:15% 
it's the smallness of the eye and the way--

441
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.822 line:15% 
not that that eye is small in any way,

442
00:17:12.822 --> 00:17:14.945 line:15% 
but the eye only sees what it knows.

443
00:17:14.945 --> 00:17:17.053 line:15% 
So the knowledge keeps you from--

444
00:17:17.053 --> 00:17:20.505 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's true, that there's a very limited spectrum</v>

445
00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.626 line:15% 
of information that can come through the senses,

446
00:17:22.626 --> 00:17:23.351 line:15% 
compared to being.
<v Candace>Well, what I'm</v>

447
00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:25.933 line:15% 
teaching people is instead of knowledge, go to no ledge.

448
00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:26.882 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

449
00:17:26.882 --> 00:17:29.154 line:15% 
<v ->Be in the transcendence of an opportunity</v>

450
00:17:29.154 --> 00:17:30.986 line:15% 
and the experiencer's experience,

451
00:17:30.986 --> 00:17:32.588 line:15% 
instead of knowledge as the thing I need

452
00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:33.459 line:15% 
to know and be right about

453
00:17:33.459 --> 00:17:37.379 line:15% 
so that can't be real and this has to be.

454
00:17:37.827 --> 00:17:41.674 line:15% 
And in the quantum leap of that opportunity

455
00:17:41.674 --> 00:17:43.647 line:15% 
into the field of "What is?",

456
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:45.364 line:15% 
not "I know!", but "What is?,"

457
00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:47.156 line:15% 
this experience can occur.

458
00:17:47.156 --> 00:17:48.892 line:15% 
We're making three movies right now,

459
00:17:48.892 --> 00:17:52.460 line:15% 
and all three movies that we're making,

460
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.113 line:15% 
I firmly, 100% believe

461
00:17:56.113 --> 00:17:58.260 line:15% 
are altering or will alter.

462
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.910 line:15% 
One, and I don't know that I'm privileged to share it,

463
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.160 line:15% 
but one is being made about a third world country,

464
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.628 line:15% 
an individual woman within it

465
00:18:05.628 --> 00:18:07.549 line:15% 
and her stand.

466
00:18:08.347 --> 00:18:10.245 line:15% 
And what's so beautiful about it is

467
00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:13.200 line:15% 
that you wanna watch the movie from right and wrong.

468
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.384 line:15% 
You wanna watch the movie from

469
00:18:14.384 --> 00:18:16.560 line:15% 
over there and we're different.

470
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.607 line:15% 
And her stand has nothing to do with her politics.

471
00:18:18.607 --> 00:18:20.421 line:15% 
It has to do with that she had no choice.

472
00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:21.962 line:15% 
That it's where she came from

473
00:18:21.962 --> 00:18:23.562 line:15% 
and that passion that came through her

474
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:26.772 line:15% 
from her own familial, historical sense of self,

475
00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.481 line:15% 
that lost the right to choose.

476
00:18:29.481 --> 00:18:31.433 line:15% 
Because how many of us, given a right to choose,

477
00:18:31.433 --> 00:18:33.518 line:15% 
choose something impossible and dangerous?

478
00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:36.937 line:15% 
Only when we're called beyond our state of self.

479
00:18:36.937 --> 00:18:39.209 line:15% 
That shadow's calling us,

480
00:18:39.209 --> 00:18:41.907 line:15% 
not our knowledge of the way it should be

481
00:18:41.907 --> 00:18:42.835 line:15% 
and what we need to do

482
00:18:42.835 --> 00:18:44.553 line:15% 
and how we need to protect ourselves.

483
00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:46.902 line:15% 
But in the making of this film,

484
00:18:46.902 --> 00:18:49.284 line:15% 
the woman that's writing it for us is one

485
00:18:49.284 --> 00:18:51.982 line:15% 
of the main writers in Big Love and Hung.

486
00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:54.393 line:15% 
Her name is Eileen Myers and she's just one

487
00:18:54.393 --> 00:18:56.897 line:15% 
of the most incredible talents I've run into.

488
00:18:56.897 --> 00:18:58.819 line:15% 
She's been studying with me for five or six years,

489
00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:03.277 line:15% 
and she's just transcended in every arena you can imagine.

490
00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:05.645 line:15% 
And the people that are producing it,

491
00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:09.218 line:15% 
they're all studying here so that we're all working together

492
00:19:09.218 --> 00:19:10.935 line:15% 
in a way to produce something

493
00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:13.159 line:15% 
that doesn't make sense until it does.

494
00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:15.581 line:15% 
So as it shows up in the world,

495
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:17.090 line:15% 
the world shows up differently.

496
00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.215 line:15% 
Not we're giving somebody something they want,

497
00:19:20.215 --> 00:19:21.677 line:15% 
or we're making money at this.

498
00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:23.960 line:15% 
There's no duality going on but just the--

499
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.336
<v Regina>You're letting the</v>
<v Candace>ways of making a</v>

500
00:19:24.336 --> 00:19:25.008 line:15% 
<v Regina>the growth</v>
<v Candace>film</v>

501
00:19:25.008 --> 00:19:25.639 line:15% 
<v Regina>be organic.</v>

502
00:19:25.639 --> 00:19:28.879 line:15% 
<v Regina>Truly on a spiritual level organic.</v>

503
00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.052 line:15% 
<v ->In the world we are being very specific.</v>

504
00:19:31.052 --> 00:19:32.748 line:15% 
<v ->It's really thirty million dollars.</v>

505
00:19:32.748 --> 00:19:34.102 line:15% 
It's really real people.

506
00:19:34.102 --> 00:19:35.425 line:15% 
We're really working on this

507
00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.973 line:15% 
but the organics comes out of what,

508
00:19:39.312 --> 00:19:43.449 line:15% 
we were called to make a movie that can't be made,

509
00:19:43.709 --> 00:19:47.123 line:15% 
that doesn't make sense, that--

510
00:19:48.203 --> 00:19:49.803 line:15% 
will go against the grain of what

511
00:19:49.803 --> 00:19:51.916 line:15% 
the mind knows to believe and make it

512
00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:55.100 line:15% 
from a point of view where there is no right.

513
00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:58.417 line:15% 
It's not coming from the politics or the religion

514
00:19:58.417 --> 00:20:01.914 line:15% 
or the standpoint or a time or a frame work

515
00:20:01.914 --> 00:20:03.744 line:15% 
that means this, that, or the other.

516
00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:06.395 line:15% 
It's an individual female stand

517
00:20:06.657 --> 00:20:09.191 line:15% 
and that transcends all space and time.

518
00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:10.927 line:15% 
<v Regina>i can't wait to see it.</v>
<v Candace>I'm so excited by it.</v>

519
00:20:12.557 --> 00:20:15.753 line:15% 
<v Regina>Let's talk about the actors themselves</v>

520
00:20:15.753 --> 00:20:17.908 line:15% 
because, as everything we've just discussed

521
00:20:17.908 --> 00:20:22.304 line:15% 
we have tended, certainly as a society since World War II

522
00:20:22.534 --> 00:20:26.597 line:15% 
to put the actors in center view

523
00:20:26.603 --> 00:20:29.590 line:15% 
in terms of objects of our admiration, right?!

524
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.542 line:15% 
"Oh, I'd love to be a famous actor.

525
00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:32.587 line:15% 
"Wouldn't that be wonderful?!

526
00:20:32.587 --> 00:20:33.963 line:15% 
"I'd love all the trappings and--"

527
00:20:33.963 --> 00:20:35.797 line:15% 
some-- the people thought for a long time.

528
00:20:36.617 --> 00:20:39.679 line:15% 
As you're dealing with the people that have done well

529
00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:41.769 line:15% 
in this field, or are on their way, people

530
00:20:41.769 --> 00:20:43.166 line:15% 
who have made in roads already,

531
00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:47.642 line:15% 
share with us the most common denominators

532
00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:51.181 line:15% 
you'll see within their being-ness, within their psyche

533
00:20:51.181 --> 00:20:53.975 line:15% 
that they possess, or have already developed or

534
00:20:53.975 --> 00:20:56.567 line:15% 
you're helping them develop, that really creates this

535
00:20:56.567 --> 00:21:00.188 line:15% 
ability to show up in the world in a successful manner.

536
00:21:00.188 --> 00:21:02.114 line:15% 
Because everybody would love to be successful

537
00:21:02.114 --> 00:21:04.017 line:15% 
in their own way and in their own lives.

538
00:21:05.905 --> 00:21:09.149 line:15% 
<v ->This is a very tough thing to share</v>

539
00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:11.218 line:15% 
because it doesn't live in our culture.

540
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.650 line:15% 
It's what we refer to as it.

541
00:21:14.082 --> 00:21:15.186 line:15% 
"They have it."

542
00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:16.501 line:15% 
"Marilyn Monroe had 'it'."

543
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.469 line:15% 
But let's look at a common denominator of these people

544
00:21:19.469 --> 00:21:21.239 line:15% 
and what "it" actually represented.

545
00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:24.433 line:15% 
So if we work backward you can see what "it" is.

546
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:27.788 line:15% 
That there's something that happened to them

547
00:21:27.788 --> 00:21:31.805 line:15% 
or didn't happen to them as little boys

548
00:21:31.805 --> 00:21:34.084 line:15% 
and little girls that substantiated

549
00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.706 line:15% 
a way of being within themselves

550
00:21:35.706 --> 00:21:37.300 line:15% 
that made them different from everyone else.

551
00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:39.775 line:15% 
<v Regina>And when you say different is there--can we start</v>

552
00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:41.983 line:15% 
with a common factor there, when you say different?

553
00:21:41.983 --> 00:21:42.800 line:15% 
<v ->Nope.</v>

554
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.663 line:15% 
[Regina] Just maybe more independent, withdrawn or--

555
00:21:45.663 --> 00:21:47.143 line:15% 
<v Candace>Nope. Maybe.</v>

556
00:21:47.143 --> 00:21:47.653
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v Candace>Maybe more</v>

557
00:21:47.653 --> 00:21:49.027 line:15% 
<v Candace>independent. Maybe more withdrawn.</v>

558
00:21:49.027 --> 00:21:51.228 line:15% 
Maybe--what causes--

559
00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:53.071 line:15% 
You know if I start to speak about that it can

560
00:21:53.071 --> 00:21:55.391 line:15% 
sound a little bit too political.

561
00:21:55.821 --> 00:21:58.985 line:15% 
If I talk about Michael Jackson or Marilyn Monroe

562
00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.565 line:15% 
or my father

563
00:22:00.565 --> 00:22:04.365 line:15% 
or Robert Downey Jr.

564
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.003 line:15% 
then it's an opinion that I'm having.

565
00:22:06.003 --> 00:22:07.507 line:15% 
So you have to be careful that...

566
00:22:07.507 --> 00:22:08.772 line:15% 
<v Regina>Still let's not name names</v>

567
00:22:08.772 --> 00:22:09.958 line:15% 
<v Candace>No it's not that.</v>
<v Regina>just factors</v>

568
00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.332 line:15% 
<v Candace>You have to be careful that you don't</v>

569
00:22:11.332 --> 00:22:12.612 line:15% 
throw that baby out with the bath water.

570
00:22:12.612 --> 00:22:15.442 line:15% 
You have to be careful that the person that's listening

571
00:22:15.442 --> 00:22:17.497 line:15% 
doesn't start listening from People magazine.

572
00:22:17.497 --> 00:22:18.997
<v Regina>No, this is a--</v>
<v Candace>Doesn't start</v>

573
00:22:18.997 --> 00:22:19.619
<v Regina>I think we have</v>
<v Candace>listening from</v>

574
00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:19.879 line:15% 
<v Regina>more subtlety.</v>

575
00:22:19.879 --> 00:22:20.896 line:15% 
<v Regina>We can hear you.</v>

576
00:22:24.326 --> 00:22:26.022 line:15% 
<v ->What's happening to them for the most part</v>

577
00:22:26.022 --> 00:22:28.043 line:15% 
is a piece or their whole goes missing.

578
00:22:29.254 --> 00:22:30.101 line:15% 
We're born being.

579
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:33.502 line:15% 
We're born fully spirit and as we come into form

580
00:22:34.932 --> 00:22:36.865 line:15% 
things happen to us at nine month, eighteen month

581
00:22:36.865 --> 00:22:39.606 line:15% 
that are beyond our--

582
00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:42.261 line:15% 
See when you're first born, you're born no thing.

583
00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:42.905 line:15% 
You're born everything.

584
00:22:42.905 --> 00:22:43.769 line:15% 
You're born no thing.

585
00:22:43.769 --> 00:22:44.420 line:15% 
You're born everything.

586
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.433 line:15% 
And as events start to happen you cried,

587
00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:50.521 line:15% 
Mommy puts a breast or a bottle in your mouth,

588
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:51.913 line:15% 
Next, time you're hungry you wiggle your toes

589
00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:52.820 line:15% 
and it doesn't do anything.

590
00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.944 line:15% 
You bat your eyes and it doesn't do anything.

591
00:22:54.944 --> 00:22:56.204 line:15% 
You turn your head and it doesn't do anyting.

592
00:22:56.204 --> 00:22:57.638 line:15% 
You cry and you get a bottle.

593
00:22:58.645 --> 00:23:01.028 line:15% 
So the next time, you cry and you get a bottle.

594
00:23:01.028 --> 00:23:03.116 line:15% 
So the next time you cry and you get a bottle.

595
00:23:03.116 --> 00:23:05.586 line:15% 
And you begin the habitude form of when I'm hungry,

596
00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:06.913 line:15% 
I cry, I get a bottle.

597
00:23:06.913 --> 00:23:09.489 line:15% 
That becomes one of the initiating factors

598
00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:13.302 line:15% 
in the bookshelf that lives in the

599
00:23:14.772 --> 00:23:17.646 line:15% 
file cabinet of the brain that we call the mind.

600
00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:22.619 line:15% 
And that mind begins to develop outside of itself

601
00:23:22.899 --> 00:23:25.698 line:15% 
and as things occur it tells it who it is.

602
00:23:26.276 --> 00:23:28.602 line:15% 
And as it tells it who it is it begins

603
00:23:28.602 --> 00:23:30.270 line:15% 
to get a sense of who it is.

604
00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:33.337 line:15% 
And it develops over, let's just give us eighteen months.

605
00:23:33.337 --> 00:23:34.841 line:15% 
Over eighteen months it develops habits

606
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:36.729 line:15% 
and patterns like record players playing.

607
00:23:36.729 --> 00:23:40.089 line:15% 
And each one plays and it plays and myriads of them now

608
00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:42.056 line:15% 
by eighteen months are playing all over the place.

609
00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:43.656 line:15% 
Daddy comes home at 6:00 PM.

610
00:23:43.656 --> 00:23:46.770 line:15% 
He picks me up out of the crip, hugs me,

611
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.999 line:15% 
gives me a big kiss and then I sit back and play

612
00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:50.364 line:15% 
with my toys 'cause I've already been

613
00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:51.534 line:15% 
bathed and fed and now it's mommy

614
00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:52.206 line:15% 
and Daddy's turn.

615
00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:54.129 line:15% 
I don't know any of this.

616
00:23:54.129 --> 00:23:55.761 line:15% 
I just know the habited--

617
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:56.207 line:15% 
<v Regina>You've been</v>
<v Candace>this is the</v>

618
00:23:56.207 --> 00:23:57.190 line:15% 
<v Regina>conditioned to that</v>
<v Candace>time of day</v>

619
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.258
<v Candace>Absolutely. We have to be careful though</v>

620
00:23:59.258 --> 00:24:01.505 line:15% 
that we don't add in words to this because

621
00:24:01.505 --> 00:24:03.466 line:15% 
I'm actually speaking a direct equation.

622
00:24:03.466 --> 00:24:04.490 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

623
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.797 line:15% 
<v ->But yes, exactly.</v>

624
00:24:06.797 --> 00:24:10.658 line:15% 
And as Daddy comes in and picks me up and

625
00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:14.564 line:15% 
every night for eighteen months this is what happens.

626
00:24:14.564 --> 00:24:17.420 line:15% 
And eighteen months and a day, Daddy doesn't come in.

627
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.276 line:15% 
I don't that is six PM, I don't know what is,

628
00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:20.676 line:15% 
but I know that that time is past

629
00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:22.938 line:15% 
because I've just been fed and I've just been bathed,

630
00:24:22.938 --> 00:24:25.369 line:15% 
and I've just...and now it's and Daddy's not coming in.

631
00:24:25.369 --> 00:24:28.194 line:15% 
And Daddy's not coming in and Daddy's not coming in.

632
00:24:28.194 --> 00:24:31.401 line:15% 
We may or may not know that it's even Daddy coming in

633
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:34.096 line:15% 
but this thing is not occurring that's the next indicated

634
00:24:34.096 --> 00:24:37.493 line:15% 
sense on my playing of the file cabinets of the way

635
00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:38.613 line:15% 
I know myself to be.

636
00:24:38.613 --> 00:24:41.792 line:15% 
And as that occurs there's this moment where

637
00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:45.621 line:15% 
it goes one eighth of a second past my comfort zone

638
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:47.338 line:15% 
that I know myself through.

639
00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:48.597 line:15% 
And in that moment we trade.

640
00:24:48.597 --> 00:24:51.594 line:15% 
We actually take a piece of our soul, our spirit,

641
00:24:51.594 --> 00:24:54.100 line:15% 
and we put it in a safe, and we replace it with

642
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.997 line:15% 
an intellectual idea of "Oh, that's what that is."

643
00:24:59.363 --> 00:25:01.790 line:15% 
And we choose to because the pain of the unknown

644
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.977 line:15% 
in the socialzed world we've only been in for

645
00:25:03.977 --> 00:25:05.438 line:15% 
eighteen months, but it's enough socialized

646
00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:08.895 line:15% 
that I know through these patternings

647
00:25:08.895 --> 00:25:10.035 line:15% 
that this is who I am.

648
00:25:10.223 --> 00:25:11.737 line:15% 
And Daddy didn't come in and now

649
00:25:11.737 --> 00:25:13.689 line:15% 
I don't know who I am because the record's playing,

650
00:25:13.689 --> 00:25:14.990 line:15% 
and it's pulling and it's pulling and it's pulling

651
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.262 line:15% 
and it can't move and it can't move and it can't move

652
00:25:17.262 --> 00:25:18.879 line:15% 
and I'm stuck within it.

653
00:25:18.879 --> 00:25:21.308 line:15% 
So in that moment I lose a sense of myself.

654
00:25:21.308 --> 00:25:24.348 line:15% 
I tell myself, "Oh, that's what that is."

655
00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:27.367 line:15% 
I say, "I don't need Daddy or I'm not good enough"

656
00:25:27.367 --> 00:25:31.249 line:15% 
or "I don't count" and whether that is.

657
00:25:31.249 --> 00:25:33.798 line:15% 
that gets put in, we take a piece of our

658
00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:36.454 line:15% 
la, la, la spirit and it get's put in the safe

659
00:25:36.454 --> 00:25:38.139 line:15% 
and we replace it with intellect that says,

660
00:25:38.139 --> 00:25:41.133 line:15% 
"I don't count," so if it ever happens again

661
00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.377 line:15% 
I'm okay with it 'cause now I know what's happening.

662
00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:44.409 line:15% 
<v Regina>You've got your justification.</v>

663
00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:45.595 line:15% 
<v Candace>Absolutely.</v>

664
00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:48.301 line:15% 
And then one eighth of a second after that

665
00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:50.385 line:15% 
Daddy walks in, picks us up, grabs us,

666
00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:53.413 line:15% 
gives a big hug and a kiss, and we'll never know why

667
00:25:53.413 --> 00:25:56.356 line:15% 
because everything moved like light

668
00:25:56.356 --> 00:25:59.202 line:15% 
literally, but the thing that stopped moving,

669
00:25:59.202 --> 00:26:01.612 line:15% 
that took that moment out, I already placed

670
00:26:01.612 --> 00:26:03.073 line:15% 
I'm never gonna get it back again

671
00:26:03.073 --> 00:26:05.983 line:15% 
until I live in the world where transcending is

672
00:26:05.983 --> 00:26:07.370 line:15% 
my way of life.

673
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.694 line:15% 
Then you can replace it all again

674
00:26:08.694 --> 00:26:10.064 line:15% 
but that's not the conversation we're having.

675
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.695 line:15% 
This begins to happen in other forms and arenas.

676
00:26:14.695 --> 00:26:16.954 line:15% 
Now of course, once that one's caught,

677
00:26:16.954 --> 00:26:20.026 line:15% 
then, someone else is a moment late

678
00:26:20.026 --> 00:26:22.063 line:15% 
or I'm a moment late for something

679
00:26:22.063 --> 00:26:24.324 line:15% 
and in that I know I don't count or

680
00:26:24.324 --> 00:26:25.081 line:15% 
I'm not good enough or

681
00:26:25.081 --> 00:26:26.361 line:15% 
whatever it is that we then use that

682
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:27.844 line:15% 
information to play forward to keep

683
00:26:27.844 --> 00:26:30.013 line:15% 
ourselves from feeling that feeling again

684
00:26:30.013 --> 00:26:33.565 line:15% 
that says to us, "I can't handle that feeling."

685
00:26:33.565 --> 00:26:34.887 line:15% 
So now we know what it is before

686
00:26:34.887 --> 00:26:35.858 line:15% 
we can't handle it.

687
00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:37.970 line:15% 
And then that same event will happen in

688
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.199 line:15% 
6 or 8 other forms by the time

689
00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:41.436 line:15% 
we're 7 or 8 years old.

690
00:26:41.436 --> 00:26:43.313 line:15% 
Now we all understand this very basically

691
00:26:43.313 --> 00:26:46.033 line:15% 
in our world, but in terms of, as actors,

692
00:26:46.803 --> 00:26:50.203 line:15% 
So, this then becomes the precipice of what's

693
00:26:50.203 --> 00:26:51.877 line:15% 
missing in who we are.

694
00:26:51.877 --> 00:26:56.282 line:15% 
That we, some of us, turn eighteen, meet a husband

695
00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:57.818 line:15% 
or a wife, get married have a baby.

696
00:27:00.448 --> 00:27:03.111 line:15% 
We are living in the distillation of that's our life

697
00:27:03.111 --> 00:27:07.716 line:15% 
in the H-O-L-E to find W-H-O-L-E and along the way

698
00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:10.105 line:15% 
of that activity, this is my life.

699
00:27:10.105 --> 00:27:10.483 line:15% 
This is what happens.

700
00:27:10.483 --> 00:27:11.443 line:15% 
This is what occurs.

701
00:27:12.223 --> 00:27:14.749 line:15% 
As an actor it's no different than the Shakespearian

702
00:27:14.749 --> 00:27:17.896 line:15% 
age where they were the outcasts because

703
00:27:17.896 --> 00:27:19.198 line:15% 
the couldn't act "normal.'

704
00:27:19.198 --> 00:27:21.981 line:15% 
Their behavior didn't seem to justify

705
00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:25.250 line:15% 
or emplify what everyone else was doing.

706
00:27:25.437 --> 00:27:27.735 line:15% 
And they needed to have the experience out loud.

707
00:27:27.741 --> 00:27:31.431 line:15% 
They needed to have this format and this way of having

708
00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:32.711 line:15% 
the experience happen again.

709
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.190 line:15% 
Now these are the few and far between

710
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.160 line:15% 
that we are talking about

711
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.344 line:15% 
not the people that come to Hollywood

712
00:27:37.344 --> 00:27:38.251 line:15% 
to get rich and famous.

713
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:39.115 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

714
00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:44.342 line:15% 
<v ->That along the way, for whatever reason, they either trade</v>

715
00:27:44.342 --> 00:27:47.424 line:15% 
the right to be public in a private situation

716
00:27:47.424 --> 00:27:49.466 line:15% 
in order to get that forum.

717
00:27:49.632 --> 00:27:51.717 line:15% 
Or they just love being public.

718
00:27:52.096 --> 00:27:55.349 line:15% 
So that's not a--that doesn't interfere with

719
00:27:55.349 --> 00:27:55.906 line:15% 
what they're doing.

720
00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:59.053 line:15% 
It somehow is a brighter light that shines

721
00:27:59.053 --> 00:28:01.283 line:15% 
or it gives them more permission

722
00:28:01.283 --> 00:28:05.041 line:15% 
or however their mosaic table came together

723
00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:06.273 line:15% 
that makes them who they are.

724
00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:09.262 line:15% 
They then have a right to pick up a piece.

725
00:28:09.262 --> 00:28:10.467 line:15% 
Now people say to me all the time,

726
00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:13.096 line:15% 
my actors, "What if I go on this thing and I'm not

727
00:28:13.096 --> 00:28:13.661 line:15% 
right for it?"

728
00:28:13.953 --> 00:28:17.070 line:15% 
Well, if you're a black, sixty year old man

729
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.979 line:15% 
you don't have to worry about getting cast

730
00:28:18.979 --> 00:28:21.064 line:15% 
as a white, thirty year old woman.

731
00:28:21.459 --> 00:28:24.044 line:15% 
You get cast...we don't understand human

732
00:28:24.044 --> 00:28:27.260 line:15% 
behavior in how blatant and obvious it is.

733
00:28:27.266 --> 00:28:28.588 line:15% 
You walk into a casting office and you think

734
00:28:28.588 --> 00:28:29.979 line:15% 
it has something to do with talent.

735
00:28:30.977 --> 00:28:33.218 line:15% 
You're getting cast because you resemble that comment.

736
00:28:33.218 --> 00:28:34.588 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

737
00:28:35.106 --> 00:28:37.122 line:15% 
And we want to make it mean something

738
00:28:37.122 --> 00:28:39.020 line:15% 
and distill it out and put it up somewhere

739
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.180 line:15% 
and say we're something better because of it.

740
00:28:41.194 --> 00:28:43.283 line:15% 
Now that doesn't mean that the viewers watching these

741
00:28:43.283 --> 00:28:45.961 line:15% 
pioneers aren't putting them on a pedestal,

742
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:48.137 line:15% 
but you and I both know they can't wait

743
00:28:48.137 --> 00:28:49.805 line:15% 
to drag them off the pedestal also.

744
00:28:49.805 --> 00:28:50.339
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

745
00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:52.877 line:15% 
<v ->So this is no longer Rock Hudson and everyone</v>

746
00:28:52.877 --> 00:28:55.907 line:15% 
keeps the story and "Shhh!" and that's actually

747
00:28:55.907 --> 00:28:57.578 line:15% 
what made him such a well known name,

748
00:28:57.578 --> 00:29:01.063 line:15% 
is that he had such a high skake risk of

749
00:29:01.653 --> 00:29:04.470 line:15% 
non comfort that he had to covet while he stood there

750
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.398 line:15% 
and did what he needed to do

751
00:29:05.398 --> 00:29:07.557 line:15% 
in order for no one to know who he really was.

752
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.251 line:15% 
And the same with Marilyn Monroe.

753
00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:12.064 line:15% 
And the same with Robert Downey Jr.

754
00:29:12.064 --> 00:29:13.885 line:15% 
The same with Leonardo Di Caprio.

755
00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.830 line:15% 
Although I think Leonardo's is a little different.

756
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.909 line:15% 
I think that what happneded with him is that

757
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:22.224 line:15% 
we identified him in such a low grade,

758
00:29:22.224 --> 00:29:25.083 line:15% 
disgusting way for so long in a cultural phenomena

759
00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:26.522 line:15% 
that no matter where he went to,

760
00:29:26.522 --> 00:29:27.642 line:15% 
the 7/11 or--

761
00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:29.402 line:15% 
that there were papers and things being

762
00:29:29.402 --> 00:29:31.209 line:15% 
spoken about this little boy.

763
00:29:31.888 --> 00:29:34.240 line:15% 
Saying things that he couldn't get away from

764
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.424 line:15% 
and he couldn't die .

765
00:29:35.424 --> 00:29:36.516 line:15% 
So he transcended self.

766
00:29:36.516 --> 00:29:38.704 line:15% 
He got the joke that the world is.

767
00:29:38.704 --> 00:29:40.805 line:15% 
The world is a concept.

768
00:29:40.805 --> 00:29:45.046 line:15% 
That he no longer acted out of

769
00:29:46.062 --> 00:29:47.977 line:15% 
"Oh, I'll act this way so you like me.

770
00:29:47.977 --> 00:29:48.766 line:15% 
"So you'll date me.

771
00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:49.929 line:15% 
"So you'll hire me

772
00:29:49.929 --> 00:29:51.134 line:15% 
"So that you'll invite me into your home.

773
00:29:51.134 --> 00:29:53.206 line:15% 
"So you think that I'm part of.

774
00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:54.707 line:15% 
"So that I don't feel alone and scared

775
00:29:54.707 --> 00:29:57.259 line:15% 
and separate from," as most people do.

776
00:29:57.259 --> 00:29:59.499 line:15% 
So they take these facades on and they

777
00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:02.143 line:15% 
come into this behaving that will have you

778
00:30:02.143 --> 00:30:04.490 line:15% 
like them, which changes depending whether

779
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.652 line:15% 
they're in this group or this group

780
00:30:05.652 --> 00:30:08.180 line:15% 
and changes depending on whether they

781
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.708 line:15% 
want to get married or get hired.

782
00:30:11.248 --> 00:30:12.887 line:15% 
But they don't know that they're schizophrenic

783
00:30:12.887 --> 00:30:14.343 line:15% 
without the forgetfulness.

784
00:30:14.343 --> 00:30:14.724 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

785
00:30:14.724 --> 00:30:15.895 line:15% 
<v ->They don't know that they're being</v>

786
00:30:15.895 --> 00:30:17.783 line:15% 
used by themselves as a puppet

787
00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:18.988 line:15% 
trying to get to safety.

788
00:30:18.988 --> 00:30:21.708 line:15% 
So Leonardo I think really got into

789
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:25.062 line:15% 
a place where he was so

790
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:27.921 line:15% 
shooken from our culture that there was nothing left.

791
00:30:27.921 --> 00:30:29.664 line:15% 
He was either gonna die or wake up.

792
00:30:29.947 --> 00:30:33.568 line:15% 
Wake up meaning become aware of the concept

793
00:30:33.568 --> 00:30:36.778 line:15% 
that my ideas are ideas not the truth and the extension

794
00:30:36.778 --> 00:30:38.372 line:15% 
of the reflection of myself.

795
00:30:38.592 --> 00:30:41.237 line:15% 
And he began to play out loud.

796
00:30:41.237 --> 00:30:44.181 line:15% 
He began to, "You're not gonna know me anyway.

797
00:30:44.181 --> 00:30:45.599 line:15% 
"And you're not gonna know the truth and your

798
00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:46.804 line:15% 
"gonna blame me for things I didn't do

799
00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:49.386 line:15% 
"And I'm gonna get this that and the other.

800
00:30:49.386 --> 00:30:51.711 line:15% 
"And no one's gonna care and no matter what I do

801
00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:53.887 line:15% 
"If I do good things, no one sees it

802
00:30:53.887 --> 00:30:56.521 line:15% 
" If I do bad, even if I don't, I get--"

803
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.977 line:15% 
It gave him the freedom to be

804
00:30:57.977 --> 00:30:58.516 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

805
00:30:58.516 --> 00:31:00.227 line:15% 
<v ->and to experience himself out loud.</v>

806
00:31:00.893 --> 00:31:04.772 line:15% 
And I think because of the way he transcended,

807
00:31:04.772 --> 00:31:08.928 line:15% 
I think because of the horrificness of the way we

808
00:31:08.928 --> 00:31:10.645 line:15% 
took this young boy, as a culture we have

809
00:31:10.645 --> 00:31:11.751 line:15% 
to take responsibility for that.

810
00:31:11.751 --> 00:31:12.805 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

811
00:31:12.805 --> 00:31:15.733 line:15% 
<v ->As a cult. Cultural. Cult you are all.</v>

812
00:31:15.733 --> 00:31:17.176 line:15% 
<v ->Agreements to agree upon the same agreements.</v>

813
00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:19.703 line:15% 
<v Regina>We have to take responsibility</v>

814
00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:20.685 line:15% 
for what we did to him.

815
00:31:20.685 --> 00:31:22.242 line:15% 
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

816
00:31:22.242 --> 00:31:27.242 line:15% 
And the gift of that is that he somehow didn't die.

817
00:31:27.447 --> 00:31:29.900 line:15% 
But what he's doing now is investigating

818
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.609 line:15% 
all of the amplifications of--

819
00:31:34.487 --> 00:31:36.071 line:15% 
of the way the world saw him

820
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:38.177 line:15% 
or he now sees the world as a result.

821
00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:39.975 line:15% 
One of my favorite all time movies

822
00:31:39.975 --> 00:31:41.393 line:15% 
in the world is Dark City.

823
00:31:41.393 --> 00:31:42.524 line:15% 
Very few people have seen it.

824
00:31:42.524 --> 00:31:45.564 line:15% 
It was labeled as a Sci-Fi Thriller

825
00:31:45.564 --> 00:31:49.627 line:15% 
and the script is so absolutely brilliant

826
00:31:49.627 --> 00:31:52.305 line:15% 
in that every night at midnight

827
00:31:52.305 --> 00:31:53.862 line:15% 
the aliens come and put a shot in their

828
00:31:53.862 --> 00:31:56.590 line:15% 
third eye, and they wake up the next morning

829
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.381 line:15% 
completely different world.

830
00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:02.643 line:15% 
So one day your my sister and we work

831
00:32:02.643 --> 00:32:05.150 line:15% 
in store and we have two children

832
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.165 line:15% 
and the next day you're my boss and

833
00:32:07.165 --> 00:32:08.371 line:15% 
the children are the neighbors

834
00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:10.696 line:15% 
and I am a street sweeper.

835
00:32:10.696 --> 00:32:13.975 line:15% 
And everyday it's an entirely different life.

836
00:32:13.975 --> 00:32:15.185 line:15% 
<v Candace>And this the way--</v>
<v Regina>That's almost</v>

837
00:32:15.185 --> 00:32:16.798 line:15% 
<v Regina>a metaphor for</v>

838
00:32:16.798 --> 00:32:17.818 line:15% 
<v Regina>for the wheel of incarnations,</v>

839
00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:19.122 line:15% 
<v Regina>for example. Yeah.</v>
<v Candace>That's exact--</v>

840
00:32:19.122 --> 00:32:20.069 line:15% 
<v Candace>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

841
00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:22.000 line:15% 
<v ->I make my students go get it and watch it</v>

842
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.159 line:15% 
<v Regina>Huh, interesting.</v>

843
00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:27.052 line:15% 
<v ->Yes. Because we're studying human behavior here.</v>

844
00:32:27.052 --> 00:32:28.034 line:15% 
We're not studying actiing.

845
00:32:28.034 --> 00:32:30.565 line:15% 
Acting in our world today is an idea.

846
00:32:31.329 --> 00:32:32.513 line:15% 
I'm gonna do this to get that.

847
00:32:32.513 --> 00:32:34.295 line:15% 
If I stand here and I put my hand on hip and

848
00:32:34.295 --> 00:32:35.756 line:15% 
I look at you like that then I'm gonna get

849
00:32:35.756 --> 00:32:37.089 line:15% 
this thing from you.

850
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:38.716 line:15% 
And all of that is reading a script,

851
00:32:38.716 --> 00:32:39.734 line:15% 
acting what you think.

852
00:32:40.104 --> 00:32:43.174 line:15% 
You know people hear, " You're a bad man."

853
00:32:43.174 --> 00:32:45.096 line:15% 
So they scream, "You're a bad man."

854
00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.321 line:15% 
But read the script.

855
00:32:46.321 --> 00:32:47.836 line:15% 
This is the love of your life.

856
00:32:47.836 --> 00:32:48.881 line:15% 
Why are you screaming?

857
00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:50.364 line:15% 
It's like, "Oh, your the love of my life."

858
00:32:50.364 --> 00:32:51.505 line:15% 
"You're a bad man."

859
00:32:51.505 --> 00:32:54.193 line:15% 
Instead of if your saying you're a bad man

860
00:32:54.193 --> 00:32:56.540 line:15% 
but I'm reading you're the love of my life.

861
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.841 line:15% 
And if the highest stake to say so.

862
00:32:57.841 --> 00:32:59.617 line:15% 
Which is how human beings live.

863
00:32:59.617 --> 00:33:00.537 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

864
00:33:00.537 --> 00:33:01.914 line:15% 
Then why wouldn't I say that

865
00:33:01.914 --> 00:33:03.119 line:15% 
to get you to love me.

866
00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:03.972 line:15% 
If you're the--so--

867
00:33:03.972 --> 00:33:08.382 line:15% 
"You're a bad man. Come here."

868
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.576 line:15% 
Do you understand that we're repeating

869
00:33:10.576 --> 00:33:12.155 line:15% 
what we think things mean.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

870
00:33:12.155 --> 00:33:15.455 line:15% 
So we're just passing the baton of

871
00:33:15.455 --> 00:33:17.023 line:15% 
more and more dissintergration

872
00:33:17.397 --> 00:33:17.853 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

873
00:33:17.853 --> 00:33:21.010 line:15% 
And people like Leonardo are standing up

874
00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.335 line:15% 
and taking on roles because they're interesting

875
00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.541 line:15% 
not because they make him money.

876
00:33:24.541 --> 00:33:28.167 line:15% 
Because they're inventive to use the pieces.

877
00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.076 line:15% 
the backdrop for the foreground themselves,

878
00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:30.966 line:15% 
to learn about themselves.

879
00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:32.653 line:15% 
And we get to peer in this little--

880
00:33:32.653 --> 00:33:35.394 line:15% 
while we go wear trench coats in the dark and eat popcorn

881
00:33:35.394 --> 00:33:37.783 line:15% 
while we watch them do these big things that no one

882
00:33:37.783 --> 00:33:40.364 line:15% 
can see us watching because it's viscerol

883
00:33:40.364 --> 00:33:42.124 line:15% 
and we're terrified to have these feeings

884
00:33:42.124 --> 00:33:44.170 line:15% 
that we can't control.

885
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.549 line:15% 
And these pioneers are walking us

886
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:48.733 line:15% 
very gently and hand in hand into

887
00:33:48.733 --> 00:33:50.620 line:15% 
this new--

888
00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.798 line:15% 
When people say, "2012! What's gonna--"

889
00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.004 line:15% 
What's gonna happen?!

890
00:33:55.004 --> 00:33:56.477 line:15% 
It started happening fifty years ago.

891
00:33:56.477 --> 00:33:57.117 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

892
00:33:57.117 --> 00:33:58.374 line:15% 
<v ->It really started happening in the beginning of time.</v>

893
00:33:58.374 --> 00:33:59.417 line:15% 
<v Candace>Right?</v>
<v Regina>(laughing) Yeah.</v>

894
00:33:59.417 --> 00:34:01.200 line:15% 
Because everything's coming out of--

895
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.176 line:15% 
That what we're doing is getting that money,

896
00:34:04.176 --> 00:34:05.990 line:15% 
property and prestige is no longer our guide.

897
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.561 line:15% 
We're going from duality into single minded of nature

898
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:11.604 line:15% 
which means I am that with which I see.

899
00:34:11.604 --> 00:34:14.627 line:15% 
So T-W-O

900
00:34:14.627 --> 00:34:17.120 line:15% 
becomes O-N-E becomes

901
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.852 line:15% 
becomes W-O-N.

902
00:34:18.852 --> 00:34:20.566 line:15% 
And that's all 2012 is and the people

903
00:34:20.566 --> 00:34:22.368 line:15% 
that can't handle that are gonna get off wheel.

904
00:34:22.368 --> 00:34:24.308 line:15% 
We're coming up with diseases that no one even

905
00:34:24.308 --> 00:34:26.111 line:15% 
under--there's no name for it.

906
00:34:26.111 --> 00:34:27.529 line:15% 
You can't cure it fast enough.

907
00:34:27.529 --> 00:34:28.436 line:15% 
They get to get off the earth.

908
00:34:28.436 --> 00:34:30.761 line:15% 
You know, "Thank you. I just hit it at the wrong time."

909
00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:32.096 line:15% 
"I'll be back in thirty-seven years."

910
00:34:32.096 --> 00:34:32.790
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

911
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.670 line:15% 
<v ->The people that are interested in this transcendence</v>

912
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.566 line:15% 
that are called by it, it's terrifying, isn't it?

913
00:34:37.566 --> 00:34:39.934 line:15% 
There's nothing about this that isn't terrifying.

914
00:34:39.934 --> 00:34:41.912 line:15% 
It so exhilarating.

915
00:34:41.912 --> 00:34:42.785 line:15% 
We don't know who we are.

916
00:34:42.785 --> 00:34:43.909 line:15% 
We don't know where we're going.

917
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.573 line:15% 
We don't know why we do it but we're called

918
00:34:45.573 --> 00:34:48.639 line:15% 
and we're drawn or the whole thing falls apart in our hand.

919
00:34:49.157 --> 00:34:52.903 line:15% 
<v Regina>And it seems that we're even more open</v>

920
00:34:52.903 --> 00:34:56.989 line:15% 
and alive in that sense, to these influences.

921
00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:57.971 line:15% 
Whatever the influence is.

922
00:34:57.971 --> 00:34:59.784 line:15% 
Whether it's something we're reading, watching news,

923
00:34:59.784 --> 00:35:02.824 line:15% 
internet, conversations with people or movies.

924
00:35:02.824 --> 00:35:03.656 line:15% 
<v ->That's right.</v>

925
00:35:03.656 --> 00:35:06.002 line:15% 
<v Regina>We're very open and it's stimulating</v>

926
00:35:06.002 --> 00:35:07.463 line:15% 
new aspects of ourselves.

927
00:35:08.413 --> 00:35:10.023 line:15% 
I've seen this in myself recently.

928
00:35:10.023 --> 00:35:12.028 line:15% 
In that I've started putting a few

929
00:35:12.028 --> 00:35:15.522 line:15% 
pieces together in this that we are in this awakening.

930
00:35:15.522 --> 00:35:17.378 line:15% 
This grand awakening and we think

931
00:35:17.378 --> 00:35:18.338 line:15% 
Oh, this is wonderful.

932
00:35:18.338 --> 00:35:20.055 line:15% 
Will we remember all of our true beauty

933
00:35:20.055 --> 00:35:23.863 line:15% 
and our true abilities and the innate power we have?

934
00:35:23.863 --> 00:35:26.412 line:15% 
Well, you know what, we're also going to remember

935
00:35:26.412 --> 00:35:27.616 line:15% 
everything else with it.

936
00:35:27.616 --> 00:35:28.364 line:15% 
<v ->Oh, but wait--</v>

937
00:35:28.364 --> 00:35:29.098 line:15% 
<v Regina>And this is</v>
<v  Candace>Let's not think</v>

938
00:35:29.098 --> 00:35:30.090 line:15% 
<v Regina>interesting.</v>
<v Candace>past that so fast</v>

939
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.661 line:15% 
<v ->because we are now</v>

940
00:35:33.661 --> 00:35:35.771 line:15% 
in a formation and equation

941
00:35:35.771 --> 00:35:37.511 line:15% 
where we can remember our true beauty.

942
00:35:37.511 --> 00:35:38.812 line:15% 
<v Candace>And the only thing</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

943
00:35:38.812 --> 00:35:41.265 line:15% 
<v ->the only thing in our way is our mind.</v>

944
00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:41.695 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes</v>

945
00:35:41.695 --> 00:35:44.990 line:15% 
<v ->If we hear the mind say, "That's impossible, you egomaniac."</v>

946
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.516 line:15% 
<v ->And we, "Oh, that's interesting,"</v>

947
00:35:46.516 --> 00:35:47.753 line:15% 
it's the same as the shadow.

948
00:35:47.753 --> 00:35:48.650 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Candace>And for the blip</v>

949
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:53.502 line:15% 
of that moment, before the education of the mind

950
00:35:53.502 --> 00:35:57.199 line:15% 
that's been played so many times takes it from you,

951
00:35:57.199 --> 00:35:59.950 line:15% 
you can have that experience.

952
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.622 line:15% 
<v Regina>I agree with that.</v>
<v Candace>In that experience--</v>

953
00:36:01.622 --> 00:36:02.270 line:15% 
<v ->Forgiving me for</v>

954
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.529 line:15% 
<v Candace>stepping in on you.</v>
<v Regina>Yeah, go ahead.</v>

955
00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:07.148 line:15% 
<v ->In that experience, we can see all the ugliness</v>

956
00:36:07.978 --> 00:36:08.978 line:15% 
because it makes sense.

957
00:36:08.978 --> 00:36:10.418 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah and I think I'm speaking</v>

958
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.630 line:15% 
more on a very kind of simple memory,

959
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.352 line:15% 
just an auric level of the memory within the aura.

960
00:36:15.352 --> 00:36:17.144 line:15% 
We're bringing back all of it.

961
00:36:17.144 --> 00:36:21.047 line:15% 
We're now open to reviewing, looking at,

962
00:36:21.047 --> 00:36:24.044 line:15% 
re-experiencing the whole enchilada.

963
00:36:24.044 --> 00:36:25.400 line:15% 
<v Candace>All the way back to the beginning of time.</v>

964
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.185
<v Regina>All the way back because we can.</v>

965
00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:28.710 line:15% 
<v Regina>Because it's being made available to us</v>

966
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.990 line:15% 
the veils are thinning.

967
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:34.753 line:15% 
<v ->Here's what happens when you're standing on a landmind.</v>

968
00:36:34.753 --> 00:36:36.743 line:15% 
Land MINE I call it.

969
00:36:36.743 --> 00:36:38.417 line:15% 
Is that when you look out you see

970
00:36:38.417 --> 00:36:39.857 line:15% 
everything as an extension of self.

971
00:36:39.857 --> 00:36:42.385 line:15% 
So I'll look out and see wizard,

972
00:36:42.385 --> 00:36:44.488 line:15% 
I'll see someone's hand and I'll see,

973
00:36:44.488 --> 00:36:45.478 line:15% 
"Oh, that's a wizards hand."

974
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:48.619 line:15% 
And then I see where the wizard was applicable

975
00:36:48.619 --> 00:36:50.850 line:15% 
to the extension of this.

976
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.884 line:15% 
And then you look out and you see all the others

977
00:36:52.884 --> 00:36:54.573 line:15% 
make perfect sense in order.

978
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:57.070 line:15% 
Nothing is out of order anymore.

979
00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.887 line:15% 
And then there's that moment and then

980
00:36:58.887 --> 00:37:00.791 line:15% 
the mind comes back and then it goes away.

981
00:37:00.935 --> 00:37:03.282 line:15% 
But it's just absolutely fantastical

982
00:37:03.282 --> 00:37:05.874 line:15% 
when you see that you are the creator of all things

983
00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:07.988 line:15% 
and what you see is because you created it

984
00:37:07.988 --> 00:37:11.121 line:15% 
to remind yourself to rewind yourself back to here

985
00:37:11.121 --> 00:37:13.324 line:15% 
which is the extension of now

986
00:37:13.324 --> 00:37:16.449 line:15% 
drawn out and reflected back in.

987
00:37:16.449 --> 00:37:17.024 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

988
00:37:17.024 --> 00:37:19.339 line:15% 
<v ->So that this conversation we're having</v>

989
00:37:19.339 --> 00:37:22.454 line:15% 
was always intended so it could not have not been intended.

990
00:37:22.454 --> 00:37:25.035 line:15% 
So when I heard about you a couple of years ago

991
00:37:25.035 --> 00:37:27.584 line:15% 
it was, "Oh, I've heard about her because

992
00:37:27.584 --> 00:37:29.004 line:15% 
I know her 'cause we've already met.

993
00:37:29.004 --> 00:37:32.044 line:15% 
So our futures and our pasts are getting intermingled.

994
00:37:32.044 --> 00:37:34.369 line:15% 
Which our presents are rising up

995
00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:38.711 line:15% 
out of that to rewind ourselves to this why

996
00:37:38.711 --> 00:37:41.336 line:15% 
only in the happenstance of now as it occurs.

997
00:37:41.336 --> 00:37:42.000 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

998
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.515 line:15% 
And that's affording us the right which is why

999
00:37:44.515 --> 00:37:46.947 line:15% 
I'm so drawn to human behavior and

1000
00:37:46.947 --> 00:37:48.472 line:15% 
putting it in what will be public.

1001
00:37:48.472 --> 00:37:50.925 line:15% 
I don't have time to hit a hundred million people.

1002
00:37:50.925 --> 00:37:53.527 line:15% 
But I can hit twenty substantial people,

1003
00:37:53.527 --> 00:37:54.924 line:15% 
and they can hit a hundred million.

1004
00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:55.799 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:37:55.799 --> 00:37:57.687 line:15% 
And they can hear and see that the prospect

1006
00:37:57.687 --> 00:38:00.536 line:15% 
of the opportunity of the mind and war is duality.

1007
00:38:00.536 --> 00:38:03.505 line:15% 
Because if I see you over there as other

1008
00:38:03.505 --> 00:38:05.048 line:15% 
then I have to protect myself from you.

1009
00:38:05.048 --> 00:38:08.760 line:15% 
If I know you are me and I just won't remember that me

1010
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.170 line:15% 
because if feels like those first eight years

1011
00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.636 line:15% 
will have to cave in on themselves and disagree to

1012
00:38:14.636 --> 00:38:18.104 line:15% 
the memories that they have in order for other to be me.

1013
00:38:18.104 --> 00:38:22.284 line:15% 
That when I get--

1014
00:38:22.284 --> 00:38:24.791 line:15% 
the theme of that equation

1015
00:38:24.791 --> 00:38:27.817 line:15% 
it becomes delicious to surrender those eight years.

1016
00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:30.925 line:15% 
Instead of "I'll die before I'll see that you have

1017
00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:32.364 line:15% 
anything to do with me.

1018
00:38:32.364 --> 00:38:35.426 line:15% 
And so extensionally we see ourselves

1019
00:38:35.426 --> 00:38:37.729 line:15% 
everywhere but really ourselves.

1020
00:38:38.279 --> 00:38:43.177 line:15% 
Really I see you before or me after I see me there.

1021
00:38:43.177 --> 00:38:45.321 line:15% 
I don't--it's so,---

1022
00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:47.405 line:15% 
<v ->have to be in that domain to</v>

1023
00:38:47.405 --> 00:38:48.655 line:15% 
have that conversation

1024
00:38:48.655 --> 00:38:49.055 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:38:49.055 --> 00:38:52.287 line:15% 
But that that absolutely is applicable to everyone.

1026
00:38:52.287 --> 00:38:55.112 line:15% 
It's just that people are ignorant. They're ignoring it.

1027
00:38:55.772 --> 00:38:57.228 line:15% 
<v Regina>In the true sense of the word ignorant,</v>

1028
00:38:57.228 --> 00:38:59.096 line:15% 
<v Regina>to ignore, not to be stupid</v>

1029
00:38:59.096 --> 00:39:00.096 line:15% 
<v Regina>but to ignore and</v>
<v Candace>That's right.</v>

1030
00:39:00.096 --> 00:39:02.142 line:15% 
<v Regina>that is very true.</v>
<v Candace>No.</v>

1031
00:39:02.142 --> 00:39:04.488 line:15% 
<v Regina>And I think that that's one of the reasons</v>

1032
00:39:04.488 --> 00:39:07.547 line:15% 
I wanted to have this conversation about

1033
00:39:07.547 --> 00:39:09.936 line:15% 
actors and the roll of film and the roll

1034
00:39:09.936 --> 00:39:11.323 line:15% 
of what you're doing working with them

1035
00:39:11.323 --> 00:39:13.469 line:15% 
because obviously your working from your own

1036
00:39:13.469 --> 00:39:15.644 line:15% 
very mystical point of view. Very--

1037
00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:17.752 line:15% 
<v ->I hate to say that into--</v>

1038
00:39:17.752 --> 00:39:19.401
<v Regina>I don't usually say</v>
<v Candace>Hollywood</v>

1039
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:19.831 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's what you're</v>
<v Candace>You and I know</v>

1040
00:39:19.831 --> 00:39:21.270 line:15% 
<v Regina>doing</v>
<v Candace>that's true</v>

1041
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.450 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's what you're doing</v>
<v Candace>Shhh!</v>

1042
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.728 line:15% 
<v ->Because here's the thing</v>

1043
00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.584 line:15% 
Hollywood has to take us seriously

1044
00:39:25.584 --> 00:39:27.834 line:15% 
and it's already lala enough.

1045
00:39:27.834 --> 00:39:28.756 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

1046
00:39:28.756 --> 00:39:29.967 line:15% 
<v ->Tinsel Town enough.</v>

1047
00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.205 line:15% 
Remember I was born and raised

1048
00:39:31.205 --> 00:39:33.033 line:15% 
in this so this is a business for me.

1049
00:39:33.455 --> 00:39:35.247 line:15% 
But you have to be very careful how you

1050
00:39:35.247 --> 00:39:37.978 line:15% 
speak into it because their listening

1051
00:39:37.978 --> 00:39:40.356 line:15% 
is already preempted for that.

1052
00:39:40.356 --> 00:39:42.447 line:15% 
Think about MIchael Jackson what a gift

1053
00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:45.977 line:15% 
and a yogi and a transcendent, amazing

1054
00:39:45.977 --> 00:39:47.620 line:15% 
individual because we couldn't quantify

1055
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.035 line:15% 
and edify him we had to take him off the throne.

1056
00:39:50.982 --> 00:39:52.755 line:15% 
It was no different than Princess Di.

1057
00:39:52.761 --> 00:39:53.870 line:15% 
We should be ashamed of ourselves

1058
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.824 line:15% 
and hopefully that we're learning this to be able to see

1059
00:39:56.824 --> 00:39:59.629 line:15% 
that what we can't handle out there.

1060
00:39:59.629 --> 00:40:01.511 line:15% 
Because if it's out there we have to feel it in here.

1061
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:04.338 line:15% 
Instead of knowing that there's nothing by accident

1062
00:40:04.338 --> 00:40:06.844 line:15% 
not on purpose going on in the world

1063
00:40:06.844 --> 00:40:09.927 line:15% 
That if it is out there it's there to teach us something

1064
00:40:09.927 --> 00:40:10.914 line:15% 
and that we bow to it.

1065
00:40:10.914 --> 00:40:13.786 line:15% 
Bow, head below the heart, intellect below the heart.

1066
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:16.581 line:15% 
So that the similarities can show up

1067
00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:19.171 line:15% 
and the differences we can become aware of

1068
00:40:19.171 --> 00:40:19.902 line:15% 
if not surrender.

1069
00:40:20.482 --> 00:40:21.668 line:15% 
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

1070
00:40:21.668 --> 00:40:24.481 line:15% 
<v Regina>Would you view then the people</v>

1071
00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:28.236 line:15% 
that do have the "it" and do make it to the big

1072
00:40:28.236 --> 00:40:28.922 line:15% 
<v Candace>Oh we never finished that</v>

1073
00:40:28.922 --> 00:40:29.309 line:15% 
<v Candace>conversation</v>
<v Regina>The big screen</v>

1074
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:30.169 line:15% 
<v Regina>I wanna get back to that one.</v>

1075
00:40:30.169 --> 00:40:31.088 line:15% 
<v Candace>Yes</v>

1076
00:40:31.958 --> 00:40:33.952 line:15% 
<v Regina>But just to side track a little bit</v>

1077
00:40:33.952 --> 00:40:35.651 line:15% 
that there's actually on a soul level

1078
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:37.880 line:15% 
<v  Regina>an agreement to help us as mirrors</v>

1079
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.512 line:15% 
<v Regina>to reflect</v>
<v Candace>that's every</v>

1080
00:40:38.512 --> 00:40:39.461 line:15% 
<v Regina>back to us</v>
<v Candace>individual</v>

1081
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:40.442 line:15% 
<v Regina>On a large level</v>
<v Candace>I have--</v>

1082
00:40:40.442 --> 00:40:42.480 line:15% 
<v Regina>I mean that takes--you have to hold a lot</v>

1083
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.578 line:15% 
of energy to take that amount of

1084
00:40:43.578 --> 00:40:45.173 line:15% 
<v Regina>judgment--</v>
<v Candace>Well isn't energy</v>

1085
00:40:45.173 --> 00:40:47.445 line:15% 
<v Regina>animosity and so forth from the public if they</v>

1086
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.070 line:15% 
turn on you for example.

1087
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.341 line:15% 
<v Candace>Isn't energy one individual</v>

1088
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:55.282 line:15% 
and as you get other you become one larger individual.

1089
00:40:55.282 --> 00:40:56.583 line:15% 
Right?! When you have children you feed

1090
00:40:56.583 --> 00:40:58.833 line:15% 
them before you feed yourself of at the same time.

1091
00:40:59.355 --> 00:41:02.118 line:15% 
That it's a larger sense of now, of here.

1092
00:41:02.118 --> 00:41:05.179 line:15% 
As you begin to transcend and reincarnate or whatever

1093
00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:07.222 line:15% 
you would like to call it, you begin to see and

1094
00:41:07.222 --> 00:41:09.896 line:15% 
extension of the self which means you are carrying

1095
00:41:09.896 --> 00:41:11.560 line:15% 
the energy of fifty or--

1096
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.237 line:15% 
Angelina Jolie.

1097
00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:14.120 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.885 line:15% 
<v Candace>I can't wait to meet her.</v>

1099
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:18.390 line:15% 
Brad Pitt and I studied for ten years together.

1100
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.054 line:15% 
I don't know how long he studied with Roy London

1101
00:41:20.054 --> 00:41:22.240 line:15% 
but we studied, I studied there for ten years

1102
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.400 line:15% 
and watching him work there and seeing that move over

1103
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.985 line:15% 
into this larger sense of I mean two continents

1104
00:41:29.985 --> 00:41:30.985 line:15% 
<v Regina>Rignt.</v>

1105
00:41:30.985 --> 00:41:31.757 line:15% 
coming together.

1106
00:41:31.757 --> 00:41:32.826 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right</v>

1107
00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:35.142 line:15% 
<v ->And when you begin to get a sense</v>

1108
00:41:35.142 --> 00:41:38.574 line:15% 
that I am--you don't get a sense that

1109
00:41:38.574 --> 00:41:40.153 line:15% 
I'm greater that's egotistical.

1110
00:41:40.153 --> 00:41:42.361 line:15% 
But you get a sense of what you can handle

1111
00:41:42.361 --> 00:41:44.867 line:15% 
as you begin to transcend the partitions

1112
00:41:44.867 --> 00:41:47.544 line:15% 
of the office that you kept yourself inside of

1113
00:41:47.544 --> 00:41:49.603 line:15% 
until those partitions start to come down

1114
00:41:49.603 --> 00:41:51.277 line:15% 
and you can see over the walls of the mind

1115
00:41:51.277 --> 00:41:52.461 line:15% 
into other is self.

1116
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:55.341 line:15% 
And so as we reincarnate, as we come back through

1117
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:58.968 line:15% 
if you get the basic behavior of totality

1118
00:41:58.968 --> 00:42:01.474 line:15% 
whether it's Adam or atom right?

1119
00:42:01.474 --> 00:42:06.210 line:15% 
Adam and Eve, history, or Adam and Adam, science.

1120
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.917 line:15% 
Adam and Eve are religion and Adam and Adam

1121
00:42:09.917 --> 00:42:10.802 line:15% 
are coming from science.

1122
00:42:10.802 --> 00:42:13.681 line:15% 
One's heterosexual, one's homosexual it's the same story.

1123
00:42:13.681 --> 00:42:16.103 line:15% 
They multiply and divide and become self.

1124
00:42:16.103 --> 00:42:18.652 line:15% 
As other, the flicker back of, "I'm not that,"

1125
00:42:18.652 --> 00:42:19.633 line:15% 
"Oh, look, I'm that."

1126
00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:20.563 line:15% 
"Oh, no, that's not me."

1127
00:42:20.563 --> 00:42:22.243 line:15% 
And it multiplies and divides again.

1128
00:42:22.243 --> 00:42:26.051 line:15% 
That the reincarnation is the original atom seeing itself

1129
00:42:26.051 --> 00:42:27.918 line:15% 
over their goes, "Oh, I'm that."

1130
00:42:27.918 --> 00:42:29.343 line:15% 
It just comes back to what it knows

1131
00:42:29.343 --> 00:42:34.031 line:15% 
in it's originating factor so that

1132
00:42:34.031 --> 00:42:36.691 line:15% 
when you say the energy that you must hold

1133
00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:38.786 line:15% 
you're holding the energy of totality.

1134
00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:40.813 line:15% 
It's only the loss of the memory of separation

1135
00:42:40.813 --> 00:42:42.756 line:15% 
<v Candace>that allows that regrouping--</v>

1136
00:42:42.756 --> 00:42:45.286
<v Regina>And maybe that's part of the beauty of</v>

1137
00:42:45.293 --> 00:42:47.450 line:15% 
individuals that do go to that

1138
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.592 line:15% 
degree of visibility accomplish.

1139
00:42:49.592 --> 00:42:51.126
<v Regina>They're able to do</v>
<v Candace>If you wanna say</v>

1140
00:42:51.126 --> 00:42:51.486 line:15% 
<v Regina>that</v>

1141
00:42:51.486 --> 00:42:52.106
<v Candace>If you wanna say that</v>

1142
00:42:52.106 --> 00:42:54.348 line:15% 
but that's even a little bit too much intellectual

1143
00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:57.811 line:15% 
for my blood because it's magnetic attraction.

1144
00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:58.995 line:15% 
It knows itself back.

1145
00:42:58.995 --> 00:43:01.288 line:15% 
It's just picking up the magnet and bringing it forward.

1146
00:43:01.566 --> 00:43:05.566 line:15% 
And it's not standing and not feeling the hurt

1147
00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:07.561 line:15% 
and the pain and the "I have to."

1148
00:43:07.561 --> 00:43:09.928 line:15% 
It has an energetic flow where it's causation

1149
00:43:09.928 --> 00:43:12.140 line:15% 
It has not choice. It's choiceless.

1150
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.321 line:15% 
That brings it to--

1151
00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:16.665 line:15% 
You know if you know anything about the

1152
00:43:16.665 --> 00:43:18.734
Vedas, which I didn't know that I was channeling

1153
00:43:18.734 --> 00:43:21.806 line:15% 
the Vedas until I went to India on a vacation

1154
00:43:21.806 --> 00:43:22.872 line:15% 
and I heard people speak--

1155
00:43:22.872 --> 00:43:23.821 line:15% 
"How do you know that?

1156
00:43:23.821 --> 00:43:24.931 line:15% 
"And how do you know that?"

1157
00:43:24.931 --> 00:43:26.189 line:15% 
"And I've told people don't look"

1158
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:28.100 line:15% 
"for this in books cause you won't find it."

1159
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.913 line:15% 
And "Your--" you know, only their saying it

1160
00:43:29.913 --> 00:43:31.492 line:15% 
in Sanskrit and their translating for me

1161
00:43:31.492 --> 00:43:33.882 line:15% 
and I'm, "Oh my goodness" and you begin to get

1162
00:43:33.882 --> 00:43:37.313 line:15% 
a sense that the original formation of the causation

1163
00:43:37.313 --> 00:43:39.883 line:15% 
of the first percolation that moves in

1164
00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:42.582 line:15% 
and it's multiplication and division that's the causation

1165
00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:44.811 line:15% 
of what the next thing is which is what we're talking about.

1166
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:48.545 line:15% 
The triangle, which I teach as need, loss, and action.

1167
00:43:50.709 --> 00:43:53.119 line:15% 
If you have need, that means the thing in front of you

1168
00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:54.655 line:15% 
is the most important thing in your life.

1169
00:43:54.655 --> 00:43:56.212 line:15% 
The person, place or thing, whatever that is.

1170
00:43:56.212 --> 00:43:57.482 line:15% 
It's the most important thing in your life

1171
00:43:57.482 --> 00:43:58.367 line:15% 
and you can't live without it.

1172
00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:01.092 line:15% 
Because if you could than you wouldn't do anything about it.

1173
00:44:01.092 --> 00:44:04.162 line:15% 
You would say, "It's gonna require to much."

1174
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.651 line:15% 
But if you can't live without it, what's the obstacle?

1175
00:44:06.651 --> 00:44:08.070 line:15% 
If you can't live without it, if you want it

1176
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:08.955 line:15% 
it means it's missing.

1177
00:44:08.955 --> 00:44:10.146 line:15% 
Cause you don't want what you already have.

1178
00:44:10.146 --> 00:44:11.796 line:15% 
Which means if you want it, it's missing.

1179
00:44:11.796 --> 00:44:12.436 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1180
00:44:12.436 --> 00:44:14.644 line:15% 
<v ->And if you want it, and it's missing,</v>

1181
00:44:14.644 --> 00:44:17.204 line:15% 
it means you must be depleted somehow.

1182
00:44:17.204 --> 00:44:18.196 line:15% 
<v Regina>And you have a fear of losing it</v>

1183
00:44:18.196 --> 00:44:19.177 line:15% 
if you do have it.

1184
00:44:19.177 --> 00:44:20.744 line:15% 
<v Candace>That's exactly correct.</v>

1185
00:44:20.744 --> 00:44:24.069 line:15% 
<v ->And then in our world today culturally what do we do?</v>

1186
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:26.042 line:15% 
We need it, we want it and then we go

1187
00:44:26.042 --> 00:44:28.506 line:15% 
"Oh, but I know the obstacles, the fear

1188
00:44:28.506 --> 00:44:30.038 line:15% 
"that I may not have it."

1189
00:44:30.038 --> 00:44:31.713 line:15% 
So we go home and wait for something else

1190
00:44:31.713 --> 00:44:33.955 line:15% 
or we complain about it or we blame it.

1191
00:44:33.955 --> 00:44:37.561 line:15% 
But when you add in action, not reactive action,

1192
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:40.308 line:15% 
but proactive action, moving toward.

1193
00:44:40.308 --> 00:44:41.492 line:15% 
Where you say, "I cannot not."

1194
00:44:41.492 --> 00:44:44.169 line:15% 
It's a mother with her child and a car is coming.

1195
00:44:44.169 --> 00:44:45.793 line:15% 
They don't say, "I can't do that."

1196
00:44:45.793 --> 00:44:48.249 line:15% 
They go get the child and if they die in the action.

1197
00:44:48.249 --> 00:44:49.219 line:15% 
they die in the action.

1198
00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.608 line:15% 
But there's no thought, there's an activity.

1199
00:44:51.608 --> 00:44:53.006 line:15% 
And this is need, loss, and action

1200
00:44:53.006 --> 00:44:54.606 line:15% 
which I teach my actors as

1201
00:44:54.606 --> 00:44:56.482 line:15% 
stakes, obstacles and through line

1202
00:44:56.482 --> 00:44:57.678 line:15% 
as they look at the character,

1203
00:44:57.678 --> 00:44:59.117 line:15% 
as you're standing in the character

1204
00:44:59.117 --> 00:45:00.536 line:15% 
it's need, loss, and action.

1205
00:45:00.536 --> 00:45:02.509 line:15% 
That its' that third part, it's that action

1206
00:45:02.509 --> 00:45:04.141 line:15% 
that sends you into the motion

1207
00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:07.292 line:15% 
that your intellectual mind disallows

1208
00:45:07.292 --> 00:45:08.420 line:15% 
and won't allow because there's too much loss.

1209
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.200 line:15% 
There's too much, "What if" along the way.

1210
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.207 line:15% 
"I can't risk that. There's insurance here."

1211
00:45:13.207 --> 00:45:14.743 line:15% 
If you look at insurance in the

1212
00:45:14.743 --> 00:45:17.665 line:15% 
Random House Dictionary it talks about

1213
00:45:17.665 --> 00:45:20.234 line:15% 
you know twenty-seven reasons why you shouldn't.

1214
00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:21.134 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:45:21.134 --> 00:45:23.278 line:15% 
<v Candace>As opposed to you have human body</v>

1216
00:45:23.278 --> 00:45:24.387 line:15% 
for a couple of years.

1217
00:45:24.387 --> 00:45:27.053 line:15% 
Think about a hundred years to billions.

1218
00:45:27.053 --> 00:45:28.866 line:15% 
You know you have just enough time to leave envelope

1219
00:45:28.866 --> 00:45:30.285 line:15% 
on the earth as you take off again.

1220
00:45:30.285 --> 00:45:33.424 line:15% 
It's like its a breath, but a breath maybe.

1221
00:45:33.424 --> 00:45:34.907 line:15% 
To leave the information that

1222
00:45:34.907 --> 00:45:37.094 line:15% 
you're magnetically attracted to.

1223
00:45:37.094 --> 00:45:38.437 line:15% 
And that with need, loss, and action what you have

1224
00:45:38.437 --> 00:45:42.459 line:15% 
is coming into motion, coming into rum.

1225
00:45:42.459 --> 00:45:44.848 line:15% 
You're taking what you need, what you know you can't have

1226
00:45:44.848 --> 00:45:45.957 line:15% 
or you'd already have it.

1227
00:45:45.957 --> 00:45:48.240 line:15% 
That the action you take is because you cannot not.

1228
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.583 line:15% 
Why? Because the thing in front of you

1229
00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:51.045 line:15% 
is the most important thing in your life.

1230
00:45:51.045 --> 00:45:51.676
<v Regina>Um hm.</v>

1231
00:45:51.676 --> 00:45:52.420 line:15% 
<v Candace>And then as you</v>
<v Regina>The resonance is</v>

1232
00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.678
<v Regina>is there, you're simply drawn.</v>

1233
00:45:53.678 --> 00:45:54.510 line:15% 
<v Candace>You're drawn.</v>

1234
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:55.076 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah</v>

1235
00:45:55.076 --> 00:45:56.601 line:15% 
<v ->As you take that action, what happens?</v>

1236
00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:58.361 line:15% 
Manifistation of the world alters

1237
00:45:58.363 --> 00:46:00.571 line:15% 
and as it alters so does the magnetic attraction.

1238
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:02.942 line:15% 
And as the magnetic attraction alters,

1239
00:46:02.942 --> 00:46:05.544 line:15% 
so does the manifestation and so on and so forth.

1240
00:46:05.544 --> 00:46:07.102 line:15% 
And then you become addicted to

1241
00:46:07.102 --> 00:46:09.491 line:15% 
awakening instead of to hiding.

1242
00:46:09.491 --> 00:46:10.909 line:15% 
So we're teaching this to actors

1243
00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:14.127 line:15% 
so that the can stand in non duality

1244
00:46:14.127 --> 00:46:16.395 line:15% 
and have a private event happen

1245
00:46:16.395 --> 00:46:19.168 line:15% 
that they're intention is so greatly on

1246
00:46:19.168 --> 00:46:20.726 line:15% 
what's in front of them that they don't remember

1247
00:46:20.726 --> 00:46:21.452 line:15% 
<v Candace>the director and money--</v>

1248
00:46:21.452 --> 00:46:23.282
<v Regina>So it becomes their experience.</v>

1249
00:46:23.282 --> 00:46:24.392 line:15% 
<v Candace>It become their experience.</v>

1250
00:46:24.392 --> 00:46:26.456 line:15% 
That they're wearing the glove of what the writer

1251
00:46:26.456 --> 00:46:28.164 line:15% 
intended, not what the writer wrote.

1252
00:46:28.164 --> 00:46:28.676 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:46:28.676 --> 00:46:30.926 line:15% 
<v ->What the writer intended and we get to see.</v>

1254
00:46:30.926 --> 00:46:31.993 line:15% 
Cause the writer can write the shell

1255
00:46:31.993 --> 00:46:33.895 line:15% 
but they bring the spirit through.

1256
00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.136 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well now let's go back to their it that</v>

1257
00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:36.238 line:15% 
allows them to do this.

1258
00:46:36.238 --> 00:46:36.817 line:15% 
<v Regina>Go head, sorry.</v>

1259
00:46:36.817 --> 00:46:37.291 line:15% 
<v Regina>Go head, sorry.</v>
<v Candace>Okay,</v>

1260
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:37.915
<v Candace>I was answering</v>
<v Regina>Finish.</v>

1261
00:46:37.915 --> 00:46:38.715 line:15% 
<v Candace>the last one you asked.</v>
<v Regina>Oh yeah.</v>

1262
00:46:38.715 --> 00:46:40.848 line:15% 
<v Candace>Because unfortunately as a scientist,</v>

1263
00:46:40.848 --> 00:46:41.721 line:15% 
<v Candace>I have to bring up</v>
<v Regina>Okay</v>

1264
00:46:41.721 --> 00:46:43.086 line:15% 
<v Candace>before we can use it.</v>

1265
00:46:43.086 --> 00:46:44.185 line:15% 
<v Candace>So I bring up the equation</v>

1266
00:46:44.185 --> 00:46:45.998 line:15% 
<v Candace>and then we move the conversation</v>
<v Regina>Okay</v>

1267
00:46:45.998 --> 00:46:48.686 line:15% 
<v Candace>and then so that the opportunity of this</v>

1268
00:46:48.686 --> 00:46:51.683 line:15% 
particular investigation as you say is, they become

1269
00:46:51.683 --> 00:46:54.211 line:15% 
larger than life as they're standing here

1270
00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:55.768 line:15% 
drawing that kind of energy.

1271
00:46:55.768 --> 00:46:58.001 line:15% 
That the manifestation of this growth,

1272
00:46:58.001 --> 00:47:01.596 line:15% 
the Vedas or whatever it is in it's originating form

1273
00:47:01.596 --> 00:47:03.948 line:15% 
coming in and through like the lotus

1274
00:47:03.948 --> 00:47:06.012 line:15% 
a thousand forms of now.

1275
00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:10.028 line:15% 
In all it's different activity and promotion of itself.

1276
00:47:10.028 --> 00:47:12.823 line:15% 
That it's standing as a larger equation

1277
00:47:12.823 --> 00:47:15.340 line:15% 
and that the larger you get the less you care

1278
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.407 line:15% 
about the loss of yourself because

1279
00:47:16.407 --> 00:47:18.566 line:15% 
how can you lose yourself if you're that large?

1280
00:47:19.287 --> 00:47:20.983 line:15% 
The loss of the mind in it's individuality

1281
00:47:20.983 --> 00:47:24.673 line:15% 
in a cult organized formation, that says, "I am that."

1282
00:47:24.673 --> 00:47:27.318 line:15% 
You've lost that by the time you've hit whatvever

1283
00:47:27.318 --> 00:47:29.430 line:15% 
math we want to use right now in an equalizing form,

1284
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:33.078 line:15% 
five, ten, two thousand individuals become it's

1285
00:47:33.078 --> 00:47:36.392 line:15% 
own manifestation of the transcendence of other as self.

1286
00:47:36.392 --> 00:47:39.150 line:15% 
That now you know your standing no different than

1287
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:42.428 line:15% 
your baby doesn't eat if you don't work.

1288
00:47:42.428 --> 00:47:44.433 line:15% 
MIchael Jackson knows that if he doesn't stand in his--

1289
00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:45.756 line:15% 
but it's not an intellectual knowing.

1290
00:47:45.756 --> 00:47:47.162 line:15% 
It's an ontological knowing.

1291
00:47:47.162 --> 00:47:49.210 line:15% 
He knows that if doesn't move this forward

1292
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.248 line:15% 
It's not intellectual like, "I have to move this forward."

1293
00:47:51.248 --> 00:47:54.693 line:15% 
But his passion, to pass himself on is born into

1294
00:47:54.693 --> 00:47:56.730 line:15% 
exisitence and "I have to dance."

1295
00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.467 line:15% 
I have to birth this thing that's percolating inside

1296
00:47:59.467 --> 00:48:00.982 line:15% 
of me, which is what a visionary is right?!

1297
00:48:00.982 --> 00:48:03.414 line:15% 
I have to birth this thing or I can't breathe.

1298
00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:06.571 line:15% 
That is the location of I'm standing as more that one.

1299
00:48:06.571 --> 00:48:07.477 line:15% 
It's not to get something.

1300
00:48:07.477 --> 00:48:08.523 line:15% 
It's not to do something.

1301
00:48:08.523 --> 00:48:10.378 line:15% 
It's not in fear of loss of something

1302
00:48:10.378 --> 00:48:12.821 line:15% 
unless the fear of loss is, "If I don't deliver this

1303
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:15.185 line:15% 
"message before the body drops, then the world

1304
00:48:15.185 --> 00:48:16.764 line:15% 
"misses the message."

1305
00:48:16.764 --> 00:48:18.360 line:15% 
How many Einsteins do we have drugged

1306
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.802 line:15% 
in mental institutions because they're so

1307
00:48:20.802 --> 00:48:23.266 line:15% 
brilliant but they can't be there and here

1308
00:48:23.266 --> 00:48:24.964 line:15% 
at the same--genius just means I can step into the

1309
00:48:24.964 --> 00:48:29.187 line:15% 
future, see it wear it, eat it, know it and bring it back.

1310
00:48:29.187 --> 00:48:30.292 line:15% 
So I'm standing in the future and the present

1311
00:48:30.292 --> 00:48:31.891 line:15% 
at the same time and I can translate it and speak

1312
00:48:31.891 --> 00:48:33.641 line:15% 
your language of what's occuring.

1313
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:34.985 line:15% 
So as we move far into the future

1314
00:48:34.985 --> 00:48:36.958 line:15% 
and we see, "Oh, there's what that is."

1315
00:48:36.958 --> 00:48:39.227 line:15% 
"How did you know that before we did?"

1316
00:48:39.227 --> 00:48:40.742 line:15% 
How many people are so far into the future

1317
00:48:40.742 --> 00:48:43.950 line:15% 
and the don't have a translation system within the self

1318
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.783 line:15% 
that they--we drug them to keep them away

1319
00:48:45.783 --> 00:48:47.874 line:15% 
from us so that we can keep our cult going,

1320
00:48:47.874 --> 00:48:50.519 line:15% 
culture going, without disorganization.

1321
00:48:50.519 --> 00:48:52.545 line:15% 
"Too many feelings. I'm gonna need to much alcohol.

1322
00:48:52.545 --> 00:48:54.602 line:15% 
"I'm not gonna be able to drive my car."

1323
00:48:54.602 --> 00:48:58.271 line:15% 
That we can keep it all, some metaphorically way, going

1324
00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:01.076 line:15% 
that the larger self is inspired.

1325
00:49:01.076 --> 00:49:04.453 line:15% 
Whether it's Marilyn Monroe

1326
00:49:04.453 --> 00:49:08.325 line:15% 
where it looks unintentional.

1327
00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:10.117 line:15% 
Nothing in our earth is unintentional.

1328
00:49:10.117 --> 00:49:12.922 line:15% 
Just the individual mind is not realized enough

1329
00:49:12.922 --> 00:49:16.036 line:15% 
to see what the intention is so it says it's not.

1330
00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:19.204 line:15% 
That we come in in the perfect paradigm

1331
00:49:19.204 --> 00:49:21.390 line:15% 
seeable by the culture at that time

1332
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:25.731 line:15% 
that allows us to listen, hear, respond, react,

1333
00:49:25.731 --> 00:49:27.323 line:15% 
<v Candace>We've used up politics.</v>

1334
00:49:27.323 --> 00:49:27.781 line:15% 
<v Regina>It is.</v>

1335
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:28.923 line:15% 
We've used up the palace.

1336
00:49:28.923 --> 00:49:30.384 line:15% 
We've used up real estate.

1337
00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:31.899 line:15% 
We've used up money.

1338
00:49:31.899 --> 00:49:33.285 line:15% 
We haven't used up real estate.

1339
00:49:33.285 --> 00:49:36.421 line:15% 
We've used up the belief in these things that

1340
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:39.187 line:15% 
we're now just standing in actor because

1341
00:49:39.187 --> 00:49:41.065 line:15% 
the actors that are acting in--

1342
00:49:41.065 --> 00:49:42.800 line:15% 
you know middle America wants to see fake actors acting,

1343
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.817 line:15% 
right because too much truth, too disorganized.

1344
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.971 line:15% 
But the more--and middle of America not meaning

1345
00:49:47.971 --> 00:49:50.019 line:15% 
the middle of America, just the mind.

1346
00:49:50.019 --> 00:49:52.487 line:15% 
I have like this, a ball.

1347
00:49:52.487 --> 00:49:54.481 line:15% 
This is normal.

1348
00:49:54.481 --> 00:49:56.199 line:15% 
Right?! Everyone's like it and here is genius

1349
00:49:56.199 --> 00:49:56.871 line:15% 
and here's insane and it's someone's

1350
00:49:56.871 --> 00:49:58.484 line:15% 
opinion which side is which.

1351
00:49:58.484 --> 00:49:59.147 line:15% 
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

1352
00:49:59.147 --> 00:50:01.266 line:15% 
<v ->But the rest is just, so like when I get everybody</v>

1353
00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:02.588 line:15% 
understands and everybody knows it

1354
00:50:02.588 --> 00:50:04.881 line:15% 
that everybody can agree to agree upon it

1355
00:50:04.881 --> 00:50:05.721 line:15% 
it's not working.

1356
00:50:05.721 --> 00:50:06.745 line:15% 
It doesn't work well.

1357
00:50:06.745 --> 00:50:08.068 line:15% 
No one's getting anything out of it.

1358
00:50:08.068 --> 00:50:09.764 line:15% 
But we can all agree upon it and that's safe.

1359
00:50:09.764 --> 00:50:12.782 line:15% 
So I'm naming that and I shouldn't say middle America.

1360
00:50:12.782 --> 00:50:15.657 line:15% 
I should say most like minded.

1361
00:50:15.657 --> 00:50:18.025 line:15% 
And then the coasts which are the outer edge.

1362
00:50:18.025 --> 00:50:19.682 line:15% 
Which are the one's that are trying the new things.

1363
00:50:19.682 --> 00:50:21.351 line:15% 
There's no bread on either side.

1364
00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:23.878 line:15% 
There's just one sided so they have the liquidation

1365
00:50:23.878 --> 00:50:25.728 line:15% 
of the oceans on either side that says,

1366
00:50:25.728 --> 00:50:27.691 line:15% 
I can be that with which I see.

1367
00:50:27.701 --> 00:50:29.416 line:15% 
I bring it into exisitence through

1368
00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:32.808 line:15% 
the minds holding of what it thinks it is.

1369
00:50:32.808 --> 00:50:35.986 line:15% 
And once I see it and I hold it, it materializes

1370
00:50:35.986 --> 00:50:39.175 line:15% 
until it goes dormant again and I can't hold it anymore

1371
00:50:39.175 --> 00:50:41.287 line:15% 
in my sense memory of myself so it's liquid.

1372
00:50:41.287 --> 00:50:44.092 line:15% 
And if I don't, if I'm not coming through passion,

1373
00:50:44.092 --> 00:50:47.068 line:15% 
that magnetically attracts itself to the memory

1374
00:50:47.068 --> 00:50:49.575 line:15% 
of it again until it's happened enough times over to

1375
00:50:49.575 --> 00:50:52.450 line:15% 
know I am that, to be in the sense memory of I am that,

1376
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:56.135 line:15% 
than it liquidizes and it doesn't come back again.

1377
00:50:56.135 --> 00:51:01.126 line:15% 
So that the opportunity of this investigation of the

1378
00:51:01.126 --> 00:51:03.750 line:15% 
coasts or wherever it is that it's coming from

1379
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.019 line:15% 
as Marilyn Monroe or whoever's actualizing,

1380
00:51:06.019 --> 00:51:09.543 line:15% 
it's coming in direct proportion of what the world at that

1381
00:51:09.543 --> 00:51:11.145 line:15% 
<v Candace>time can hear--</v>

1382
00:51:11.145 --> 00:51:11.962 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Candace>and receive</v>

1383
00:51:11.962 --> 00:51:12.655 line:15% 
<v Regina>Can resonate with.</v>

1384
00:51:12.655 --> 00:51:14.381 line:15% 
<v Candace>Absolutely.</v>

1385
00:51:14.381 --> 00:51:18.427 line:15% 
<v Regina>So at this point we have a few minutes left.</v>

1386
00:51:18.427 --> 00:51:21.403 line:15% 
Is it worth trying to identify the "it"ness anymore.

1387
00:51:21.403 --> 00:51:24.720 line:15% 
We talked about hole so to speak that goes unfilled.

1388
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.248 line:15% 
And then there's a need to fulfill and become the

1389
00:51:27.248 --> 00:51:28.829 line:15% 
<v Regina>whole with the W as we say.</v>

1390
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:29.406
<v Candace>Absolutely</v>

1391
00:51:29.406 --> 00:51:30.596 line:15% 
<v Regina>And so in the early stages</v>

1392
00:51:30.596 --> 00:51:32.687 line:15% 
is there anything else we need to know about

1393
00:51:32.687 --> 00:51:36.004 line:15% 
individuals that somehow are able to transcend themselves?

1394
00:51:36.004 --> 00:51:36.858 line:15% 
<v Regina>Their own--</v>

1395
00:51:36.858 --> 00:51:38.174
<v ->[Candace I think a tie into that</v>

1396
00:51:38.174 --> 00:51:40.478 line:15% 
is perfect chaos is our gift.

1397
00:51:40.478 --> 00:51:41.804 line:15% 
I think it tied to that and I think that's

1398
00:51:41.804 --> 00:51:43.593 line:15% 
why I've been

1399
00:51:43.593 --> 00:51:47.271 line:15% 
so called to India.

1400
00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:52.064 line:15% 
I went on vacation to get away from all this.

1401
00:51:52.064 --> 00:51:53.206 line:15% 
It sounded really good.

1402
00:51:53.206 --> 00:51:55.222 line:15% 
I never saw myself in India.

1403
00:51:55.222 --> 00:51:57.984 line:15% 
You go there and you see what's absolutely

1404
00:51:57.984 --> 00:52:01.141 line:15% 
dirty and less than and poor and broke

1405
00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:04.480 line:15% 
and horrifying and the wrong people in this

1406
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.410 line:15% 
and you have to pay off the guy to get to the

1407
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.290 line:15% 
and "Where's the--there's no ambulance or fire truck.

1408
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.314 line:15% 
If it burns, it burns.

1409
00:52:10.314 --> 00:52:11.732 line:15% 
And it is the way it is.

1410
00:52:11.732 --> 00:52:14.424 line:15% 
And it looks wrong until you get a breath.

1411
00:52:15.188 --> 00:52:17.134 line:15% 
Till the smallest part of you sees

1412
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:19.150 line:15% 
other as self and it just sees that it's the

1413
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:20.569 line:15% 
most beautiful thing in the world.

1414
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:22.979 line:15% 
I've taken something like a hundred people

1415
00:52:22.979 --> 00:52:26.202 line:15% 
over there in the last couple of years.

1416
00:52:26.202 --> 00:52:30.042 line:15% 
One of my students I took, Chris Evans,

1417
00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:31.780 line:15% 
who's a wonderful actor who I just--

1418
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.519 line:15% 
I just adore this young man.

1419
00:52:33.519 --> 00:52:34.639 line:15% 
Watch his star rise.

1420
00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:35.631 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1421
00:52:35.631 --> 00:52:38.722 line:15% 
<v ->And we were watching this little puppy on</v>

1422
00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:41.111 line:15% 
the side of the road and he wouldn't leave

1423
00:52:41.111 --> 00:52:43.585 line:15% 
until we saw that puppy had been fed.

1424
00:52:43.585 --> 00:52:45.219 line:15% 
<v Candace>And he was just so adorable.</v>

1425
00:52:45.219 --> 00:52:47.609 line:15% 
<v Candace>He's like, "How are these animals like this?"</v>

1426
00:52:47.609 --> 00:52:51.444 line:15% 
And I shared with him that these animals

1427
00:52:51.444 --> 00:52:53.236 line:15% 
have never been to L.A.

1428
00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:54.261 line:15% 
They've never been to America

1429
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:55.808 line:15% 
They've never seen that they're missing anything.

1430
00:52:55.808 --> 00:52:59.214 line:15% 
They don't know that it isn't perfection in action.

1431
00:52:59.214 --> 00:53:02.289 line:15% 
And the perfect chaos is that we begin to get to see.

1432
00:53:02.289 --> 00:53:06.369 line:15% 
We get to begin to see that there's nothing wrong.

1433
00:53:07.412 --> 00:53:09.993 line:15% 
And when somehow that spot hits

1434
00:53:09.993 --> 00:53:11.337 line:15% 
you can see there's nothing wrong,

1435
00:53:11.337 --> 00:53:14.527 line:15% 
a whole new dimension opens up from it.

1436
00:53:14.527 --> 00:53:17.940 line:15% 
And you see this imperfect order.

1437
00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.100 line:15% 
This chaos, that only to America,

1438
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.191 line:15% 
is it so different that we call it chaos.

1439
00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:23.825 line:15% 
But to them it's perfect Karma.

1440
00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:26.544 line:15% 
That that action is causing that reaction in that moment.

1441
00:53:26.544 --> 00:53:28.518 line:15% 
That there's nothing wrong with that dog.

1442
00:53:28.518 --> 00:53:31.227 line:15% 
And how adorable he and the other people with us

1443
00:53:31.227 --> 00:53:33.765 line:15% 
were saying, " Well we can't leave till we feed them,

1444
00:53:33.765 --> 00:53:34.761 line:15% 
"Till we feed this puppy."

1445
00:53:34.761 --> 00:53:39.304 line:15% 
It's okay and we got--but I said isn't it interesting how

1446
00:53:39.304 --> 00:53:41.341 line:15% 
intellectualized that is because they felt the puppy,

1447
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:43.389 line:15% 
they saw the puppy fat and happy and

1448
00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:44.914 line:15% 
it made them so happy.

1449
00:53:44.914 --> 00:53:48.142 line:15% 
But isn't that--didn't you feed that puppy for you?

1450
00:53:48.946 --> 00:53:50.562 line:15% 
You didn't feed that puppy for the puppy

1451
00:53:50.562 --> 00:53:52.183 line:15% 
because if you had fed that puppy for the puppy,

1452
00:53:52.183 --> 00:53:53.548 line:15% 
you would have brought that puppy with you.

1453
00:53:53.548 --> 00:53:55.244 line:15% 
Because what's gonna happen tomorrow

1454
00:53:55.244 --> 00:53:58.335 line:15% 
morning when it doesn't have food?

1455
00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:02.164 line:15% 
We begin to lose that we are seeing other to take

1456
00:54:02.164 --> 00:54:04.276 line:15% 
care of them and we get that other is self

1457
00:54:04.276 --> 00:54:07.252 line:15% 
and in that extraordinary activity,

1458
00:54:07.252 --> 00:54:09.428 line:15% 
as we take care of you we grow the depth

1459
00:54:09.428 --> 00:54:10.964 line:15% 
of who we know ourselves to be.

1460
00:54:10.964 --> 00:54:12.862 line:15% 
And then the tectonic plates turn over

1461
00:54:12.862 --> 00:54:15.027 line:15% 
and we actually see that we're using them

1462
00:54:15.027 --> 00:54:16.073 line:15% 
to feel better about ourselves.

1463
00:54:16.073 --> 00:54:18.259 line:15% 
And then we actually go to work,

1464
00:54:18.259 --> 00:54:19.646 line:15% 
go to play, go to play, go to work.

1465
00:54:19.646 --> 00:54:23.016 line:15% 
We actually can't wait to be informed and all of this.

1466
00:54:23.016 --> 00:54:25.725 line:15% 
That that other over there is perfection in action.

1467
00:54:25.725 --> 00:54:28.285 line:15% 
That nothing needs to be changed.

1468
00:54:28.285 --> 00:54:30.258 line:15% 
<v Regina>It's only our own judgments and perceptions.</v>

1469
00:54:30.258 --> 00:54:31.602 line:15% 
that would see it that way.

1470
00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.226 line:15% 
And there is in India this beautiful

1471
00:54:34.226 --> 00:54:37.085 line:15% 
rhythm of life that occurs and to me

1472
00:54:37.085 --> 00:54:39.772 line:15% 
it was exemplified on the roadway.

1473
00:54:39.772 --> 00:54:43.377 line:15% 
Again talking about chaos where you have a person

1474
00:54:43.377 --> 00:54:46.140 line:15% 
walking, maybe a sadhu walking the side of the road,

1475
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.617 line:15% 
a bicyclist passing him, and a tuk tuk passing him,

1476
00:54:49.617 --> 00:54:52.668 line:15% 
and then maybe a taxi and then a big top heavy bus,

1477
00:54:52.668 --> 00:54:55.819 line:15% 
all passing going the same direction and the exact same

1478
00:54:55.819 --> 00:54:57.696 line:15% 
thing happening on the other side of the street.

1479
00:54:57.696 --> 00:55:01.249 line:15% 
<v Regina>And it's just terrifying and yet it's a beautiful</v>

1480
00:55:01.249 --> 00:55:01.569 line:15% 
<v Candace>Dance.</v>

1481
00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:03.820 line:15% 
<v Regina>dance where everything just fits.</v>

1482
00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.613 line:15% 
<v Regina>Everything fits</v>
<v Candace>Perfectly</v>

1483
00:55:05.613 --> 00:55:06.253 line:15% 
<v Regina>perfectly.</v>

1484
00:55:06.253 --> 00:55:07.319 line:15% 
<v Candace>And then you step one dimension</v>

1485
00:55:07.319 --> 00:55:09.230 line:15% 
further and you see they're not thinking

1486
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.127 line:15% 
from the American mind to India.

1487
00:55:11.127 --> 00:55:12.047
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Candace>They don't know</v>

1488
00:55:12.047 --> 00:55:13.285 line:15% 
<v Candace>any different.</v>

1489
00:55:13.285 --> 00:55:14.056 line:15% 
<v Candace>It's all</v>
<v Regina>That's all.</v>

1490
00:55:14.056 --> 00:55:14.997 line:15% 
<v Candace>That's their balance.</v>

1491
00:55:14.997 --> 00:55:15.573 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1492
00:55:15.573 --> 00:55:19.914 line:15% 
<v ->So our gift going there is seeing perfection in chaos.</v>

1493
00:55:19.914 --> 00:55:23.700 line:15% 
That to us looks chaotic, to them is just another day.

1494
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.034 line:15% 
<v Regina>It's just a</v>
<v Candace>It makes</v>

1495
00:55:24.034 --> 00:55:25.695 line:15% 
<v Regina>different rhythm.</v>
<v Candace>perfect sense.</v>

1496
00:55:26.558 --> 00:55:28.886 line:15% 
<v Regina>Any final thoughts that you would like,</v>

1497
00:55:28.886 --> 00:55:30.838 line:15% 
cause we could obviously talk quite a long time.

1498
00:55:31.748 --> 00:55:32.664 line:15% 
Any final thoughts?

1499
00:55:32.664 --> 00:55:35.469 line:15% 
We have about five minutes left of what you'd

1500
00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:38.867 line:15% 
like to say about how you're perceiving--

1501
00:55:38.867 --> 00:55:40.650 line:15% 
We'll go away from the Hollywood thing now,

1502
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.623 line:15% 
but what you're perceiving and what you're trying to pass

1503
00:55:42.623 --> 00:55:45.727 line:15% 
on right now with the people that you work with.

1504
00:55:45.727 --> 00:55:48.916 line:15% 
Probably the biggest thing, especially since, post 911

1505
00:55:48.916 --> 00:55:50.815 line:15% 
I know you do these beautiful free

1506
00:55:50.815 --> 00:55:52.436 line:15% 
meditations every Friday night.

1507
00:55:52.436 --> 00:55:53.359 line:15% 
<v Regina>So anyone's that in the</v>

1508
00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:53.627 line:15% 
<v Candace>Well they're</v>
<v Regina>Los Angeles</v>

1509
00:55:53.627 --> 00:55:55.031 line:15% 
<v Candace>actually active meditations.</v>

1510
00:55:55.031 --> 00:55:58.391
<v Regina>Yes, I meant free as people</v>

1511
00:55:58.391 --> 00:55:59.905 line:15% 
are free to join in with you.

1512
00:55:59.905 --> 00:56:02.732 line:15% 
<v ->Right but it's not just a passive meditation.</v>

1513
00:56:02.732 --> 00:56:05.952 line:15% 
It's a half an hour of meditation and then an hour of

1514
00:56:05.952 --> 00:56:09.252 line:15% 
the quantum field investigation and talk as we have been.

1515
00:56:09.252 --> 00:56:11.780 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes. And so you have that going.</v>

1516
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.017 line:15% 
That's on Friday evenings.

1517
00:56:13.017 --> 00:56:15.609 line:15% 
Anyone in the Southern California area can certainly

1518
00:56:15.609 --> 00:56:17.220 line:15% 
find you or even passing through.

1519
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.564 line:15% 
What are a couple of the other things

1520
00:56:18.564 --> 00:56:20.068 line:15% 
you're working on right now for anyone

1521
00:56:20.068 --> 00:56:20.953 line:15% 
who wants to join in with you?

1522
00:56:20.953 --> 00:56:23.278 line:15% 
<v ->Oh, wow, we have things going on all the time.</v>

1523
00:56:23.278 --> 00:56:25.827 line:15% 
I'm not the person to ask so we have

1524
00:56:25.827 --> 00:56:27.758 line:15% 
a website that you can look it up on.

1525
00:56:27.758 --> 00:56:29.656 line:15% 
I know we're going to Bali.

1526
00:56:29.656 --> 00:56:31.885 line:15% 
I know that we have a trip to Mexico.

1527
00:56:31.885 --> 00:56:34.765 line:15% 
We have some--I'm working with the

1528
00:56:34.765 --> 00:56:37.831 line:15% 
Jewish Women's Federation right now.

1529
00:56:37.831 --> 00:56:39.423 line:15% 
I do speaking engagements all over

1530
00:56:39.423 --> 00:56:41.994 line:15% 
and so many I can't say what they are

1531
00:56:41.994 --> 00:56:44.596 line:15% 
but they can certainly go on our website.

1532
00:56:44.596 --> 00:56:48.007 line:15% 
We also video all of our free classes

1533
00:56:48.007 --> 00:56:49.663 line:15% 
so that people can watch them.

1534
00:56:49.663 --> 00:56:51.607 line:15% 
We start Candace Silvers TV this month.

1535
00:56:51.607 --> 00:56:53.435 line:15% 
<v Regina>Oh, wonderful. Where's that going to appear?</v>

1536
00:56:53.435 --> 00:56:54.481
<v Candace>Yes, on our website.</v>

1537
00:56:54.481 --> 00:56:54.825 line:15% 
<v Regina>Very good.</v>

1538
00:56:54.825 --> 00:56:57.816 line:15% 
<v ->And in June we start webinars so that you know we--</v>

1539
00:56:57.816 --> 00:56:58.733 line:15% 
We travel around the world

1540
00:56:58.733 --> 00:57:01.487 line:15% 
and we get requests to come back more and more.

1541
00:57:01.487 --> 00:57:03.535 line:15% 
Clearly I can't and I have four beautiful

1542
00:57:03.535 --> 00:57:06.319 line:15% 
children that I'm here with so I can't

1543
00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:08.847 line:15% 
travel as much as I'd like to so we

1544
00:57:08.847 --> 00:57:11.012 line:15% 
found a way to travel all the time.

1545
00:57:11.012 --> 00:57:11.609 line:15% 
<v Regina>Wonderful.</v>

1546
00:57:11.609 --> 00:57:12.327 line:15% 
<v Candace>I think</v>

1547
00:57:12.327 --> 00:57:13.405 line:15% 
<v Candace>if I were to leave</v>
<v Regina>Any thoughts?</v>

1548
00:57:13.405 --> 00:57:13.911 line:15% 
<v ->someone--</v>

1549
00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:14.380 line:15% 
<v ->[Regina} Um hm.</v>

1550
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.411 line:15% 
with something,

1551
00:57:18.891 --> 00:57:22.871 line:15% 
it would be there's no way to learn this.

1552
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:26.523 line:15% 
To me, life and process are the same word.

1553
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.989 line:15% 
Life is an idea.

1554
00:57:27.989 --> 00:57:29.824 line:15% 
Process is what you're in right now.

1555
00:57:29.824 --> 00:57:32.501 line:15% 
And if you trade one for the other

1556
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:33.770 line:15% 
you'll actually get that you're

1557
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:35.466 line:15% 
having your future life presently.

1558
00:57:35.466 --> 00:57:38.421 line:15% 
And in order to do that you have to lose what you think.

1559
00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:39.903 line:15% 
In order to lose what you think you have to be wiling

1560
00:57:39.903 --> 00:57:43.177 line:15% 
to risk the loss of what needs to happen to see what's

1561
00:57:43.177 --> 00:57:44.319 line:15% 
also going on.

1562
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:46.731 line:15% 
And what it does is takes you one second beyond

1563
00:57:46.731 --> 00:57:48.245 line:15% 
what you know and once you touch once

1564
00:57:48.245 --> 00:57:50.282 line:15% 
second beyond what you know you've touched

1565
00:57:50.282 --> 00:57:52.255 line:15% 
the outter ring of the smallness of the mind.

1566
00:57:52.255 --> 00:57:53.535 line:15% 
No one takes their mind back.

1567
00:57:53.535 --> 00:57:55.387 line:15% 
<v Candace>No one chooses--</v>

1568
00:57:55.387 --> 00:57:56.240 line:15% 
<v Candace>to take</v>
<v Regina>That limitation.</v>

1569
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.679 line:15% 
<v Candace>That's right. Not to take it back.</v>

1570
00:57:58.679 --> 00:58:00.674 line:15% 
And that the opportunity of that investigation

1571
00:58:00.674 --> 00:58:03.671 line:15% 
is what I live in, what I teach,

1572
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:05.505 line:15% 
what I believe in, they way I--

1573
00:58:05.505 --> 00:58:07.820 line:15% 
We have two hundred children in India that we're

1574
00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.648 line:15% 
building a school before right now.

1575
00:58:09.648 --> 00:58:11.952 line:15% 
We are building a meditation garden.

1576
00:58:11.952 --> 00:58:14.694 line:15% 
We're doing--we come up with reasons

1577
00:58:14.694 --> 00:58:16.966 line:15% 
to get together and play full out.

1578
00:58:16.966 --> 00:58:17.990 line:15% 
Play full out means--

1579
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:19.985 line:15% 
you know these movies that we're making

1580
00:58:19.985 --> 00:58:21.030 line:15% 
we don't know how they're gonna turn out

1581
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.153 line:15% 
but we're playing full out to cause

1582
00:58:23.153 --> 00:58:24.976 line:15% 
the creation of that investigation.

1583
00:58:24.976 --> 00:58:26.416 line:15% 
So we're transcending.

1584
00:58:26.416 --> 00:58:27.814 line:15% 
The film is transcending.

1585
00:58:27.814 --> 00:58:29.467 line:15% 
The scripts we're writing are transcending

1586
00:58:29.467 --> 00:58:30.672 line:15% 
as we're doing it.

1587
00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:32.037 line:15% 
Nothing is outcome oriented.

1588
00:58:32.037 --> 00:58:33.669 line:15% 
Nothing is to do to get done.

1589
00:58:33.669 --> 00:58:35.824 line:15% 
And yet, a commitment is a commitment.

1590
00:58:35.824 --> 00:58:37.925 line:15% 
Right?! So you never don't follow it

1591
00:58:37.925 --> 00:58:38.874 line:15% 
all the way through.

1592
00:58:38.874 --> 00:58:40.986 line:15% 
And holding the rope of the commitment

1593
00:58:40.986 --> 00:58:42.895 line:15% 
you transcend in all the arenas

1594
00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:45.613 line:15% 
that you thought to think.

1595
00:58:45.613 --> 00:58:49.655 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well I'm most interested in seeing the outcome</v>

1596
00:58:49.655 --> 00:58:50.935 line:15% 
of the film you were speaking of

1597
00:58:50.935 --> 00:58:51.560 line:15% 
<v Regina>and the others as well.</v>

1598
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:51.954 line:15% 
<v Candace>Me too.</v>

1599
00:58:51.954 --> 00:58:54.301 line:15% 
<v Regina>Thank you so much for your time and all</v>

1600
00:58:54.301 --> 00:58:55.965 line:15%

1601
00:58:55.965 --> 00:59:00.775 line:15% 
and also for your influence in the way the

1602
00:59:00.775 --> 00:59:02.866 line:15% 
conscientiousness in this part of the world

1603
00:59:02.866 --> 00:59:06.280 line:15% 
and Hollywood begins moving itself.

1604
00:59:07.011 --> 00:59:07.982 line:15% 
<v ->God bless you.</v>

1605
00:59:07.982 --> 00:59:09.240 line:15% 
Thank you for what you do.

1606
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.381 line:15% 
What an honor it is to sit in front of

1607
00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:12.903 line:15% 
such a powerful woman in her own right.

1608
00:59:13.027 --> 00:59:17.058 line:15% 
It's a true gift to find a spirit right in front of you.

1609
00:59:17.058 --> 00:59:20.016 line:15% 
<v Regina>Thank you. Namaste.</v>
<v Candace>Namaste.</v>

1610
00:59:25.173 --> 00:59:26.709 line:15%
