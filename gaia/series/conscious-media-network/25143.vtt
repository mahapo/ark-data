00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.839
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.709
<v ->For those of you curious about the nature of</v>

3
00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.749
extraterrestrials or off planet cultures as they're

4
00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.249
sometimes called, James Gilliland's ranch

5
00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.149
up in Oregon is a refuge.

6
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.469
A couple of times a year James invites people from

7
00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.749
around the world to join him in watching the night

8
00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.629
skies for anomalous events and UFO's.

9
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.809
And invites speakers to speak about all the issues

10
00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.909
surrounding the notion of earth as a part

11
00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.869
of a galactic civilization.

12
00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.848
Scott and I had a wonderful time at this year's

13
00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:35.589
ECETI event and spoke with James about the nature

14
00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.219
of some of the types of beings that visit the ranch.

15
00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.228
<v ->James, it's so wonderful to see you again and to be...</v>

16
00:00:43.228 --> 00:00:45.088
I haven't been out here for, I think a decade.

17
00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.548
It was 2001 last time I was out at the ranch.
<v ->Oh yeah?</v>

18
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.968
<v ->And oh my God, what a magical place.</v>

19
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:51.768
<v ->A lot of changes since then.</v>

20
00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:54.588
<v ->A lot of changes and Mt. Adams hasn't changed.</v>

21
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.148
<v ->No.</v>

22
00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:58.288
<v ->The zinging by of craft overhead hasn't changed.</v>

23
00:00:58.288 --> 00:00:59.548
<v ->No, they're still here.</v>

24
00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:01.788
<v ->But it's as sweet as can be and a lot more people</v>

25
00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:04.448
are showing up, you've really put it together.

26
00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:05.227
<v ->Yes.</v>

27
00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:07.087
<v ->And one of the things I think that draws people,</v>

28
00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:10.587
is on your website you have these incredible images.

29
00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:11.187
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

30
00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:14.867
<v ->Of phasing-in beings.</v>

31
00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:18.027
You can say ascended master-beings.

32
00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:20.247
That you've captured on film and others have

33
00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.307
captured on film.

34
00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:24.307
Just talk a little bit about this place

35
00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:25.887
and what's phasing in here.

36
00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:27.286
And give us some of the examples of what

37
00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.847
people have captured.

38
00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:32.346
<v ->This weekend people here captured</v>

39
00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:36.127
so many things, I've seen some of the, just the photos

40
00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:39.707
and the footage and everything was just phenomenal.

41
00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:42.447
I can't wait until it all gets put together so I can see

42
00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:46.487
all of it, but some of the most brilliant and thick orbs

43
00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:51.107
I've ever seen like pink and gold with lion faces and

44
00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:55.927
things like that, have been in very clear, bright images.

45
00:01:56.573 --> 00:02:00.953
That the UFO's came in as usual and we got a lot of footage

46
00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:03.573
of the UFO's coming in and powering up and doing their...

47
00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:04.993
<v ->Lot more than ten years ago.</v>

48
00:02:04.993 --> 00:02:06.033
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

49
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:06.773
<v ->Lot more.</v>

50
00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.673
<v ->And then the first night, Friday night, was just insane.</v>

51
00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:12.993
They just kept coming and coming, big ships, really low.

52
00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:15.173
And we got a lot of that on film.

53
00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:18.733
But as far as the other manifestations here, we've had

54
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.193
a Quanion actually manifest.

55
00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:23.853
And they start off as this...

56
00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:26.853
Light starts to appear, all these little light spheres

57
00:02:26.853 --> 00:02:29.073
start to appear and they coalesce and all of a sudden

58
00:02:29.073 --> 00:02:32.453
it turns into this image of a being.

59
00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:37.453
And we had Quanion was photographed through that

60
00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:41.353
whole phase, three phases of manifestation.

61
00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:42.513
<v ->It was magnificent imaging.</v>

62
00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:46.853
<v ->Yeah, and Kahn, who's kind of a Buddhist monk came here</v>

63
00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:48.833
and he was one that took those pictures.

64
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.853
And then after he took that picture I asked him to

65
00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:55.789
meditate on Cazikula being that I work with.

66
00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.608
Which is just, comes, as a pure golden light of energy.

67
00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:03.469
And he does 21 day dark retreats.

68
00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.409
And so his third eye is wide open, he can see these beings.

69
00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.569
And somehow he gets them on his camera as well.

70
00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.369
So he went out there and meditated and Cazikula

71
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.489
appeared to him and he took a picture.

72
00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.069
And he got this huge golden ball of light with wings on it.

73
00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.589
And in the background, in this field right here, is where

74
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.849
he took it, it looks like Jerusalem in the background.

75
00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:25.709
It's really...

76
00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.689
<v ->Isn't that amazing.</v>

77
00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:27.149
<v ->Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.729
<v ->Almost holographic.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

79
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.369
<v ->Like phasing-in from some other field.</v>

80
00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.009
<v ->And Cazikula is an ascended version Ezekiel.</v>

81
00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.249
Ezekiel merged with Kassia, a feminine energy

82
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.969
and ascended, so I thought that was interesting.

83
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.489
And then he took some pictures of some feline beings

84
00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.729
that we've been working with.

85
00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.209
Some six dimensional felines appeared to him.

86
00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.369
And you can see this energy cross start to appear.

87
00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.689
And all this beautiful pink energy kind of starts to appear

88
00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.489
and then all of a sudden pops in, these felines.

89
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.109
And he said they were 12 to 14 feet tall.

90
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.039
Very tall feline beings.

91
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:08.837
And in his own words, when they appeared to him, he goes,

92
00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:12.258
"Aww, so holy, so holy."

93
00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:15.958
You know, like this, and then after that he goes,

94
00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.138
"sexy body" you know, like this, which was really funny.

95
00:04:19.138 --> 00:04:22.638
<v ->We still have the human mojo going on at the same time.
<v ->Yeah, yeah exactly.</v>

96
00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:24.398
<v ->That's amazing.</v>

97
00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:24.998
<v ->Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.778
<v ->Well, talk, you know...</v>

99
00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:31.778
I really resonate with the information that Cazekiel

100
00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:35.438
has brought through to you.

101
00:04:35.438 --> 00:04:39.898
It's very near and dear to a lot of what I find

102
00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:41.798
and have found over the last couple decades

103
00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:43.418
to have truth in it.

104
00:04:43.418 --> 00:04:47.998
And so it's no surprise that you're here in this place

105
00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:49.918
and that these other beings are coming through.

106
00:04:49.918 --> 00:04:51.838
Because you look at them in a very loving

107
00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:53.858
and non-threatening manner.

108
00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:55.458
And that makes all the difference.

109
00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:56.118
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

110
00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:58.978
<v ->Compared to what could be happening up here.
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

111
00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:01.478
<v ->Under other guidance.</v>

112
00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:01.898
<v ->Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:04.998
<v ->So let's talk about the nature, as you say, of the feline</v>

114
00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:09.478
beings, you've mentioned the Arcturions and other beings

115
00:05:09.478 --> 00:05:10.218
that have been here.

116
00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:12.658
Let's talk about the nature of the kind of beings that you

117
00:05:12.658 --> 00:05:15.718
have witnessed, others have witnessed, and are working

118
00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:16.798
with the energies here.

119
00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:18.518
So people can get a reflection other than

120
00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:19.638
Hollywood's version.

121
00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:20.738
<v ->Oh yeah, yeah.</v>

122
00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:24.358
The thing about that is that the mind in which you seek

123
00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:26.138
is the mind in which you connect.

124
00:05:26.138 --> 00:05:31.016
So, and through guiding the mind, it's sad, but Hollywood

125
00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.615
is just promoting this fear and againstness

126
00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:34.875
and separation game.

127
00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.756
And you know, fear and suspense is what they capitalize on.

128
00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:43.576
So the real story, the real picture, is mostly benevolent.

129
00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:46.176
The vast majority of it is all benevolent.

130
00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:49.876
And if people need to be afraid of something, they should

131
00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:53.996
be really looking within and at our own species here.

132
00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:56.136
And how we treat each other and the planet.

133
00:05:56.136 --> 00:05:59.296
And how we react to things that are different from us.

134
00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:01.936
I mean that's where the real aggressive, fearful things

135
00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:02.816
are going on.

136
00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:07.696
So it's important to realize that, is that when you master

137
00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:10.976
your fears and you master your old wounds and traumas

138
00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:13.456
and your ignorance and things like that, then you're ready

139
00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.865
to contact these other beings.

140
00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.665
Because, you know, they've already mastered themselves.

141
00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:20.505
That's why they're coming from the higher dimensions.

142
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:24.985
They're very beautiful, exquisitely loving beings.

143
00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:29.985
And you know if you're gonna chase around

144
00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.905
the fear and suspense program and see everything

145
00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:36.945
as a threat and everything's gonna come down and

146
00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:39.785
eat your brains and turn you into human pilaf.

147
00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:44.025
And some bugs are gonna invade and all these

148
00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.645
other programs that they have going...

149
00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.765
<v ->I think we have a new Transformer movie coming on.</v>

150
00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:49.605
Big metal beings are going to...
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

151
00:06:49.605 --> 00:06:50.825
<v ->Grab and just...</v>

152
00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:54.305
<v ->Yeah and you know people need to get out of that program.</v>

153
00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:58.725
You know what's really sad is that they don't do a movie,

154
00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:02.005
you know, just the truth is so outrageous.

155
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.765
<v ->And so much more intriguing.</v>

156
00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:04.135
<v ->Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:04.135 --> 00:07:05.882
<v ->And beautiful, I've never understood why doesn't
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

158
00:07:05.882 --> 00:07:07.002
Hollywood do this?

159
00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:08.062
<v ->Yeah, why don't they do...</v>

160
00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:11.062
I mean the closest they got was maybe E.T. and Cocoon.

161
00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:13.602
<v ->Well and Close Encounters a little bit.</v>

162
00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:18.402
<v ->Yeah, but now they've shifted it into E.T. biting</v>

163
00:07:18.402 --> 00:07:21.142
heads off and you know E.T. turns out to be this

164
00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:23.662
nasty, aggressive race.

165
00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:25.162
And you know they've...

166
00:07:25.162 --> 00:07:27.202
War of the Worlds and all these other things

167
00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:27.962
they're promoting.

168
00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:30.942
I think they've got, I haven't seen it, but something Battle

169
00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:35.182
for LA, or there's three or four others out there now.

170
00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:40.182
And they're all geared around E.T's trying to come

171
00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:43.542
down and pretty much destroy the planet.

172
00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:45.282
<v ->Yeah, walked out of that one after about five</v>

173
00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:47.782
or ten minutes, I thought I am not going to even subject

174
00:07:47.782 --> 00:07:49.142
myself to this bull.

175
00:07:49.142 --> 00:07:52.962
<v ->Yeah and I don't even go to see them either.</v>

176
00:07:52.962 --> 00:07:55.782
I don't think, you know, you look at what Mel Gibson

177
00:07:55.782 --> 00:07:58.342
did with several things.

178
00:07:58.342 --> 00:07:59.721
You know, one with the...

179
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.502
<v ->Oh Signs?</v>

180
00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:01.602
<v ->Signs, yeah.</v>

181
00:08:01.602 --> 00:08:05.421
And his movie about Christ, it was pretty bad too.

182
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.782
I mean it promotes this enlightenment through suffering

183
00:08:09.782 --> 00:08:12.862
and all this other program going.

184
00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:14.682
You know the separation game.

185
00:08:14.682 --> 00:08:17.062
<v ->And the crops circles.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:17.062 --> 00:08:19.122
<v ->To take the crop circles and make such a damaging</v>

187
00:08:19.122 --> 00:08:20.642
message out of that.

188
00:08:20.642 --> 00:08:23.802
<v ->Yeah we warned you, you know, like crop circles</v>

189
00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:25.522
are warning that they're coming to eat us.

190
00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:26.482
It's just like...

191
00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:29.022
<v ->The reality and you know this creates a real schism</v>

192
00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:31.542
within the psyche of human beings.

193
00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.422
And I guess that's the intention.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:33.422 --> 00:08:35.102
<v ->Because when people go out, when they...</v>

195
00:08:35.102 --> 00:08:37.322
Even if you just look at a picture of a crop circle,

196
00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:41.422
immediately you find the mind and the heart opening.

197
00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:43.782
And it's such an exquisite experience.

198
00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:46.882
And then to take that and assign such a negative

199
00:08:46.882 --> 00:08:49.062
message to it, I really...

200
00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:52.182
I mean this is no secret and our viewers are certainly

201
00:08:52.182 --> 00:08:53.522
on board with us on this one.

202
00:08:53.522 --> 00:08:56.802
This is intentional to create this kind of schism.

203
00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.872
Especially as we're awakening.

204
00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:02.131
It definitely is, the schism thing has been going on.

205
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:04.491
The schism game you might say, has been going

206
00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:07.471
on since the beginning of time basically.

207
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.070
<v ->Yes.</v>

208
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.071
<v ->Especially with the Bible, you know, when you read</v>

209
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:13.571
the old testament, you have this real jealous, wrathful God.

210
00:09:13.571 --> 00:09:14.591
Nobody could appease.

211
00:09:14.591 --> 00:09:16.591
He's a genocidal maniac.

212
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:20.591
You know, he wants everybody to sacrifice their kids.

213
00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:22.851
You know, destroy these whole villages.

214
00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:24.911
Kills all the men, women, and children.

215
00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:28.431
Bashes their heads out on rocks until their brains fall out.

216
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:29.031
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

217
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:31.331
<v ->You know stories like this, and this is in the Bible,</v>

218
00:09:31.331 --> 00:09:34.071
you read this story and you're going wait a second,

219
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:38.111
this old testament, this guy was not a happy camper.

220
00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.471
And he didn't really care much for his kids either.

221
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:43.031
I mean what father would do that to their kids, come on.

222
00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:45.511
<v ->I felt that in Sunday school when I was five.</v>

223
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:45.991
<v ->Yeah.</v>

224
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:47.011
<v ->This doesn't make sense.</v>

225
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:48.851
<v ->Exactly, and then you have the new testament.</v>

226
00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:50.731
And then you have Jesus coming in and he's saying,

227
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.291
"I'm bringing a new covenant."

228
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:56.151
Which means the old program is over with.

229
00:09:56.151 --> 00:09:58.651
And he's aligned with a whole different being.

230
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.971
And this being is supposed to be the God of love and peace.

231
00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:06.971
And he's non-judging, all-forgiving.

232
00:10:07.236 --> 00:10:11.455
Jesus says, "Neither do I judge thee, nor does my Father

233
00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:14.415
"judge thee, just stop doing what you're doing.

234
00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:16.155
"Stop sinning, you know, stop screwing up."

235
00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:19.555
And basic action, reaction you know.

236
00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:20.835
He's explaining that.

237
00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:25.255
And so anyway, the schism game is going back,

238
00:10:25.255 --> 00:10:26.835
all the way back to then.

239
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:30.335
When these beings were here passing themselves

240
00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:34.755
off as God, who had names, had bodies.

241
00:10:34.755 --> 00:10:39.555
You know, they ate food, they ate fruit.

242
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.855
You know, it was pretty...

243
00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:44.255
We need to really look at that.

244
00:10:44.404 --> 00:10:45.944
These other dimensional entities.

245
00:10:45.944 --> 00:10:49.144
I think the hard thing, or at least interdimensional

246
00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:53.404
entities, and this whole notion of multi-dimensionality,

247
00:10:53.404 --> 00:10:55.704
I don't think has been properly explored when it comes

248
00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:57.144
to the E.T. realm.

249
00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:57.684
<v ->Exactly.</v>

250
00:10:57.684 --> 00:11:00.724
<v ->And a common understanding, because if you're here and</v>

251
00:11:00.724 --> 00:11:03.124
you're eating food, you're in a third dimensional vehicle.

252
00:11:03.124 --> 00:11:03.584
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

253
00:11:03.584 --> 00:11:08.584
<v ->This is not a coming from an ascended or higher</v>

254
00:11:09.024 --> 00:11:11.264
dimensional realm to begin with.
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

255
00:11:11.264 --> 00:11:13.824
<v ->And that's not something we tend to look at yet,</v>

256
00:11:13.824 --> 00:11:15.884
because we've shied away from the notion

257
00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.284
of multi-dimensionality.

258
00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:20.304
<v ->Yeah, why does a spirit need to eat?</v>

259
00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:23.104
Why would God need your fatty calves?

260
00:11:23.104 --> 00:11:23.824
<v ->Exactly.</v>

261
00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:26.704
<v ->And your grains and your fruit and your incense.</v>

262
00:11:26.704 --> 00:11:27.704
And all your other stuff.

263
00:11:27.704 --> 00:11:29.244
I said, come on, you know think about it.

264
00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:33.784
And so in ancient days, the gig was that hop down

265
00:11:33.784 --> 00:11:36.804
to the earth bed and breakfast, right, and do a few

266
00:11:36.804 --> 00:11:39.724
tricks, pass yourself off as a God.

267
00:11:39.724 --> 00:11:41.564
Or an angel or whatever.
<v ->Scare the people.</v>

268
00:11:41.564 --> 00:11:44.764
<v ->You know, and snag a few daughters here and there.</v>

269
00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:49.764
And you know, basically they just took care of you.

270
00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:51.884
You were a God basically.

271
00:11:51.884 --> 00:11:53.864
Because they are very primitive.

272
00:11:53.864 --> 00:11:56.104
And they saw everything they couldn't understand

273
00:11:56.104 --> 00:12:01.044
if they saw some abilities or technologies that were not

274
00:12:01.044 --> 00:12:02.244
part of their reality.

275
00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.144
They had no reference points for 'em, so you were

276
00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:05.584
a God basically.

277
00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:08.684
And there were self-serving Gods that came here.

278
00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:12.184
And there were some very loving, serving God beings

279
00:12:12.184 --> 00:12:14.404
that came here, but I'm talking about the little g now.

280
00:12:14.404 --> 00:12:16.264
<v ->The little g, we're talking about E.T.'s.</v>

281
00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:19.164
Other species from other places.

282
00:12:19.164 --> 00:12:21.164
<v ->Yeah and I always ask about that.</v>

283
00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:24.224
You know, first of all, why are these gods male?

284
00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:26.824
You know, did they have a mother?

285
00:12:26.824 --> 00:12:30.744
And basically who created them?

286
00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:32.984
<v ->Yes, who created them?</v>

287
00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:37.064
Yet at the same time, as you say, this schism has

288
00:12:37.064 --> 00:12:39.124
persisted, it's a little more...

289
00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:40.404
It's dressed up differently.

290
00:12:40.404 --> 00:12:41.284
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

291
00:12:41.284 --> 00:12:44.164
<v ->It's a little more sophisticated in the way that</v>

292
00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:45.524
the message comes now.

293
00:12:45.524 --> 00:12:48.884
But it's the same message and the schism still exists.

294
00:12:48.884 --> 00:12:51.304
<v ->Yeah, the most disempowering message I've ever</v>

295
00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:54.144
heard was the message of the Savior.

296
00:12:54.144 --> 00:12:57.064
You know, that's going to come and do everything for you.

297
00:12:57.064 --> 00:12:59.084
Clean up all your messes.

298
00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:01.144
And relieve you of personal choice

299
00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:03.084
and personal responsibility.

300
00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:06.324
And it just doesn't work that way.

301
00:13:06.324 --> 00:13:09.744
I mean there are teachers and healers.

302
00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:12.604
There's people here that can help us along the way,

303
00:13:12.604 --> 00:13:17.524
but ultimately it all points back to self responsibility

304
00:13:17.524 --> 00:13:20.424
and self-awareness basically.

305
00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:25.124
<v ->Yes, let's go back now as we started to a little</v>

306
00:13:25.124 --> 00:13:27.244
bit ago and look at the nature of some of the beings.

307
00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:29.964
And I choose to speak to you about this specifically.

308
00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:33.364
Because of your openness and your open-heartedness.

309
00:13:33.364 --> 00:13:37.304
And as a result of that, you've had a fair amount of contact

310
00:13:37.304 --> 00:13:39.124
with a lot of different kinds of beings.

311
00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:42.364
Give us a little tour through the cosmos and the kind

312
00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.044
of beings that are coming here.

313
00:13:44.044 --> 00:13:46.744
Where they're from, what their characteristics are,

314
00:13:46.744 --> 00:13:49.484
in terms of what they're bringing to...

315
00:13:49.484 --> 00:13:53.149
<v ->Yeah, well I'll go from the bottom to the top, how's that?</v>

316
00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:54.429
<v ->Yeah that sounds good.</v>

317
00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:57.089
<v ->So basically, living on a vortex here, the veils</v>

318
00:13:57.089 --> 00:13:58.169
are very thin.

319
00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:00.909
And when you do your practices, you start seeing

320
00:14:00.909 --> 00:14:02.729
through the veils and you see what's happening

321
00:14:02.729 --> 00:14:04.449
on a multi-dimensional level.

322
00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:07.769
And some of the low level things that are going on

323
00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:10.849
are you know, we have some of the greys and the reptilians

324
00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:11.729
and things like that.

325
00:14:11.729 --> 00:14:14.509
And those are all depicted in ancient paintings

326
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:16.109
and pyramids and things like that.

327
00:14:16.109 --> 00:14:18.789
They show the different levels of beings.

328
00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:23.229
And then in the astral level, what we call, they are

329
00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.449
the fourth dimension, they're in that realm.

330
00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:27.949
And they can influence you because they have

331
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:31.889
non-physical bodies, they have mental and emotional bodies.

332
00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:36.329
But they don't have physical bodies in that realm,

333
00:14:36.329 --> 00:14:39.549
in the fourth dimension, so they can influence us

334
00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:41.870
through our mental and emotional bodies.

335
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.489
And a lot of thoughts and feelings and things of that nature

336
00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:46.849
aren't ours, we're getting input.

337
00:14:46.849 --> 00:14:49.429
So you know, you have discarnate people,

338
00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:52.429
all kinds of things in the fourth dimension.

339
00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:55.469
So that's the dimension where things go bump in the night.

340
00:14:55.469 --> 00:14:58.599
You know, the kind of crazy stuff.

341
00:14:58.638 --> 00:15:01.959
And once people are hallucinating off and having a dark

342
00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:04.418
trip or experience, they're tripping around in that

343
00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:05.618
lower astral realm.

344
00:15:05.618 --> 00:15:08.919
Let's talk about, just for a moment, as you ascend up here.

345
00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:09.638
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

346
00:15:09.638 --> 00:15:13.357
<v ->With the reptilians and the grays, do you align</v>

347
00:15:13.357 --> 00:15:15.058
those particular beings...

348
00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:17.877
Has been done quite a bit, with some of the

349
00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:21.137
controlling influences on the planet?

350
00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:23.497
I mean do you think that that's where they're aligned more?

351
00:15:23.497 --> 00:15:26.617
<v ->There is, there's definitely an alliance that happened.</v>

352
00:15:26.617 --> 00:15:30.877
You know, with some of the rogue elements of the government.

353
00:15:30.877 --> 00:15:33.517
You might say that people don't even know about that,

354
00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:35.238
that are actually running the show.

355
00:15:35.238 --> 00:15:37.177
I call 'em the powers at war.

356
00:15:37.177 --> 00:15:37.876
<v ->Yes, I love that.</v>

357
00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:41.496
<v ->'Cause yeah they were the powers that be,</v>

358
00:15:41.496 --> 00:15:43.555
but they're folding, they're imploding on themselves

359
00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:45.736
due to what's happening on the planet right now.

360
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:46.395
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

361
00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:50.675
<v ->And that's very thick, that combination together,</v>

362
00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:54.275
with some of the black ops military stuff.

363
00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:58.175
You know, whatever you wanna call it, it's like

364
00:15:58.175 --> 00:16:00.735
the rogue military covert stuff.

365
00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:02.815
<v ->So they would be more aligned with the astral realm</v>

366
00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:04.535
entities, the reptilians, the grays.

367
00:16:04.535 --> 00:16:05.275
<v ->Exactly.</v>

368
00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:06.236
<v ->And that's how you see it as well.</v>

369
00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:08.675
<v ->And the elite too, they do ceremony to bring that in.
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

370
00:16:08.675 --> 00:16:12.075
<v ->They connect with these entities to gain</v>

371
00:16:12.075 --> 00:16:13.335
power over others.

372
00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:17.015
The bottom line is love is the ultimate power.

373
00:16:17.015 --> 00:16:19.654
It empowers, it never over powers, it serves.

374
00:16:19.654 --> 00:16:22.474
And so really they've trapped themselves into

375
00:16:22.474 --> 00:16:23.914
a very low level.

376
00:16:23.914 --> 00:16:25.714
They're very spiritually poor.

377
00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:28.294
And they're not very evolved beings.

378
00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:31.654
Although they may have money and power and things

379
00:16:31.654 --> 00:16:35.034
like that, they're extremely poor.

380
00:16:35.034 --> 00:16:35.674
<v ->Yes.</v>

381
00:16:35.674 --> 00:16:36.814
<v ->On everything else.</v>

382
00:16:36.814 --> 00:16:39.174
And so that's one thing going on.

383
00:16:39.174 --> 00:16:41.554
But we really stay on top of that and keep

384
00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:44.054
the energies clear here by inviting the more

385
00:16:44.054 --> 00:16:45.675
benevolent energies in.

386
00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:47.574
<v ->Did you know the energy here is so pristine,</v>

387
00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:51.455
people are having amazing experiences and dream time.

388
00:16:51.455 --> 00:16:53.194
And you feel as though as you go to sleep at night,

389
00:16:53.194 --> 00:16:54.374
is when it all begins.

390
00:16:54.374 --> 00:16:58.294
It's just almost like fairies floating around you.

391
00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:00.694
And doing their little healing work.

392
00:17:00.694 --> 00:17:02.594
It's really sublime, I just...

393
00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:04.254
Anybody come up here and at least camp,

394
00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:06.094
even if they can't make it to the conference.

395
00:17:06.094 --> 00:17:09.615
But, okay so, we've covered that part which I think

396
00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:11.154
is important to settle as a base.

397
00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:11.894
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

398
00:17:11.894 --> 00:17:13.494
<v ->Because that's a question that would be coming up.</v>

399
00:17:13.494 --> 00:17:15.394
Let's go now, the next notch up.

400
00:17:15.394 --> 00:17:18.854
<v ->Okay, so the next notch up, when you get out</v>

401
00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:21.714
of the little more clarity on the fourth dimension,

402
00:17:21.714 --> 00:17:24.195
in the low levels of the fourth dimension, you have

403
00:17:24.195 --> 00:17:26.934
you know the things that go bump in the night.

404
00:17:26.934 --> 00:17:29.494
Or whatever, they dump on you too.

405
00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:30.134
<v ->Yeah that too.</v>

406
00:17:30.134 --> 00:17:33.174
<v ->But they, you know, that's where you have the low</v>

407
00:17:33.174 --> 00:17:35.054
level astral beings, morbid.

408
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.874
As I was saying, kind of demonic.

409
00:17:36.874 --> 00:17:40.634
Low level E.T.'s, whatever kind of stuff, reptilians.

410
00:17:40.634 --> 00:17:42.154
<v ->Which the military interphases with quite a bit.</v>

411
00:17:42.154 --> 00:17:46.134
<v ->And then as you move up, you have everyday</v>

412
00:17:46.134 --> 00:17:49.695
Bob, Joe, Sue that died, you know, that crossed over.

413
00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:50.754
And they're just hanging out.

414
00:17:50.754 --> 00:17:53.414
In the mid-levels, you might say, getting ready

415
00:17:53.414 --> 00:17:54.854
for their next reincarnation.

416
00:17:54.854 --> 00:17:57.714
And when you get into the higher astral levels,

417
00:17:57.714 --> 00:18:00.414
you have teachers and guides and things like that.

418
00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:01.844
But they're still stuck.

419
00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:03.423
They're stuck on the wheel.

420
00:18:03.423 --> 00:18:05.803
And the reason they're stuck is because they have

421
00:18:05.803 --> 00:18:09.863
some religious or cultural belief or something that

422
00:18:09.863 --> 00:18:13.044
creates separation, they're not in unity consciousness.

423
00:18:13.044 --> 00:18:17.043
So they haven't evolved beyond that to see the God

424
00:18:17.043 --> 00:18:19.863
in every one and every thing, including themselves you know?

425
00:18:19.863 --> 00:18:20.283
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

426
00:18:20.283 --> 00:18:23.083
<v ->And become one with that source.</v>

427
00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:25.782
So they're still on the wheel, so their teachings

428
00:18:25.782 --> 00:18:28.442
are going to be limited, you know, but they can help.

429
00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.782
<v ->Yes, that's an important distinction.</v>

430
00:18:30.782 --> 00:18:33.322
They can help, they can see and maybe add a little

431
00:18:33.322 --> 00:18:35.961
more perspective than what you may have in that moment.

432
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:36.362
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

433
00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:36.941
<v ->Yeah.</v>

434
00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:41.762
<v ->And you know, like if Bob at Bob's garage</v>

435
00:18:41.762 --> 00:18:43.301
or something like dies, right?

436
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:46.581
And you can't fix your car and your stuck, well you know,

437
00:18:46.581 --> 00:18:48.321
if you tune into Bob, Bob could probably...

438
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.241
<v ->Bob will give you a hint.</v>

439
00:18:49.241 --> 00:18:50.141
<v ->Show you what to do.</v>

440
00:18:50.141 --> 00:18:52.061
<v ->Yeah and that's true on many levels.</v>

441
00:18:52.061 --> 00:18:53.501
<v ->But Bob might be an alcoholic too.</v>

442
00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:56.401
So next thing you know, you're having a real strong...

443
00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:59.461
<v ->And that's a good point, because a lot of times these</v>

444
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.902
beings are very eager to still be of service

445
00:19:01.902 --> 00:19:04.201
and participate with the people that are incarnate

446
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:05.421
at that time.

447
00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:08.801
And it just, as you say, might be of limited service.

448
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:11.462
<v ->Yeah and so Bob might wanna vicariously</v>

449
00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:12.781
have a few beers through you.

450
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:13.582
<v ->Haha, yeah.</v>

451
00:19:13.582 --> 00:19:15.222
<v ->So you have to watch out for that.</v>

452
00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:17.301
And that's one of the things we teach here.

453
00:19:17.301 --> 00:19:20.421
We teach how to heal unseen negative influences.

454
00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:22.481
How to sense and clear these energies.

455
00:19:22.481 --> 00:19:24.681
And that's one of the first things we teach here.

456
00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:26.801
Even before meditation or anything.

457
00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:30.021
So that's imperative you know, that people learn that.

458
00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:30.601
<v ->Yes.</v>

459
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:32.941
<v ->But going out of the fourth, you get beyond the fourth</v>

460
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:34.641
dimension, then you start getting to the

461
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:35.761
fifth dimensional beings.

462
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:36.741
And those beings...

463
00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:40.661
That's the level where, I hate to use the word God,

464
00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:42.881
because it's so screwed up right now, you know?

465
00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.881
But that's the level where the source knows itself

466
00:19:45.881 --> 00:19:48.441
to be man or woman and men or women know

467
00:19:48.441 --> 00:19:50.860
themselves to be this source, they've merged.

468
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.269
So it's a unification level.

469
00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:53.769
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

470
00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:58.769
<v ->And on that level, you know you're shifted</v>

471
00:19:59.169 --> 00:20:00.549
into pure service mode.

472
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.929
You're here just to serve, you're off the wheel.

473
00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:06.249
You choose to incarnate, you don't have to incarnate.

474
00:20:06.249 --> 00:20:07.169
You know, it's like...

475
00:20:07.169 --> 00:20:07.629
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

476
00:20:07.629 --> 00:20:09.669
<v ->It's like your finished, you know, basically.</v>

477
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:11.969
And you can move on from there to the sixth, seventh

478
00:20:11.969 --> 00:20:13.689
and whatever you dimensions you wanna go.

479
00:20:13.689 --> 00:20:16.087
<v ->Well now, what about beings from off-planet cultures?</v>

480
00:20:16.087 --> 00:20:17.787
From that dimensional realm.

481
00:20:17.787 --> 00:20:19.227
How would they appear?

482
00:20:19.227 --> 00:20:22.528
Or do you know beings from the fifth dimension then?

483
00:20:22.528 --> 00:20:26.047
<v ->That's a lot of what we work with, is there are some</v>

484
00:20:26.047 --> 00:20:28.607
fifth dimensional Pleiadians that come here that

485
00:20:28.607 --> 00:20:30.126
look just like us.

486
00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:30.647
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

487
00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:31.486
<v ->You know they're just...</v>

488
00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:33.107
<v ->Or should we say we look just like them?</v>

489
00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:34.667
<v ->Oh yeah, like a frequency.</v>

490
00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.226
You know, they have a higher frequency.

491
00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:38.507
So they're exquisite, they're...

492
00:20:38.507 --> 00:20:40.926
You fall in love with them as soon as you meet them.

493
00:20:40.926 --> 00:20:43.166
You know, 'cause they're exuding this love.

494
00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:44.806
And they're just so...

495
00:20:44.806 --> 00:20:49.127
They just exude this giddy bliss energy, you know?

496
00:20:49.127 --> 00:20:50.805
It's just really fun to be around them.

497
00:20:50.805 --> 00:20:52.905
<v ->And when they're communicating their messages</v>

498
00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:55.665
to you and the people that are out here, what's the

499
00:20:55.665 --> 00:20:58.285
nature of what they're passing to you?

500
00:20:58.285 --> 00:21:01.345
<v ->You know the main message that they've given</v>

501
00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:03.545
is they want us to release the past.

502
00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:06.485
And they said the past is creating our tomorrow.

503
00:21:06.485 --> 00:21:09.405
So all of our old wounds and traumas and grudges

504
00:21:09.405 --> 00:21:12.524
and unforgiveness that we're carrying within us,

505
00:21:12.524 --> 00:21:13.924
is creating our tomorrow.

506
00:21:13.924 --> 00:21:18.104
And so they're very active right now in helping us

507
00:21:18.104 --> 00:21:20.784
both individually clear those patterns

508
00:21:20.784 --> 00:21:22.004
and heal those patterns.

509
00:21:22.004 --> 00:21:24.024
But also, the earth itself.

510
00:21:24.153 --> 00:21:26.525
Including what psychometrized into the earth.

511
00:21:26.525 --> 00:21:27.004
<v ->Yes.</v>

512
00:21:27.004 --> 00:21:29.844
<v ->They're moving, they're cleaning up those energies too.</v>

513
00:21:29.844 --> 00:21:33.044
So you know, if you walk into an area where there's a battle

514
00:21:33.044 --> 00:21:36.044
happened, like a Native American battle or any kind

515
00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:39.224
of battle, you walk in there, and you just go, oh God.

516
00:21:39.224 --> 00:21:41.484
You know, you feel the energy.

517
00:21:41.484 --> 00:21:44.824
And you just go, "What happened?"

518
00:21:44.824 --> 00:21:45.404
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

519
00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:46.744
<v ->You know if you're sensitive.</v>

520
00:21:46.744 --> 00:21:49.819
And so there's places where just really

521
00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:53.079
old consciousness, that's no longer applicable,

522
00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:56.740
is ingrained in the land.

523
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.059
You know a good example is the Dome of the Rock.

524
00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:01.680
<v ->Oh yes I've been there.</v>

525
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.166
<v ->Well what people don't realize, is that there was</v>

526
00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.529
a Saurian ship that dropped in on that.

527
00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:10.049
<v ->Okay now, the videos that we saw.</v>

528
00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:11.669
There were three different people captured

529
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:12.649
them that I saw.

530
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:13.269
<v ->Mmhmm, yeah.</v>

531
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:14.269
<v ->Let's talk about that for a minute.</v>

532
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:16.848
That was amazing, that was enchanting.

533
00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:19.829
<v ->And what they do is they'll have the real videos</v>

534
00:22:19.829 --> 00:22:22.649
come on and then they'll flood it with fake ones.

535
00:22:22.649 --> 00:22:24.989
That's basically what the YouTube does

536
00:22:24.989 --> 00:22:26.429
and the government does, right?

537
00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:27.969
<v ->Well the first ones, the fresh ones,</v>

538
00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:30.429
that came out were amazing.
<v ->They were exquisite, exactly.</v>

539
00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:34.089
And I asked, I go, what was that about, you know?

540
00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:35.169
What was that about?

541
00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:37.069
And they told me and said they just dropped in

542
00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:41.969
and they completely shifted the energy over there.

543
00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:43.828
And if you think about the Dome of the Rock and the

544
00:22:43.828 --> 00:22:48.408
Wailing Wall, that's an old, old consciousness that is so...

545
00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:49.188
<v ->So much suffering.</v>

546
00:22:49.188 --> 00:22:51.928
<v ->Yeah, and trained and stuck in there.</v>

547
00:22:51.928 --> 00:22:56.288
And the energy just needs to be shifted and changed.

548
00:22:56.288 --> 00:23:00.268
Because that place is actually holding that energy.

549
00:23:00.268 --> 00:23:03.187
It's holding the rest of the planet down from evolving

550
00:23:03.187 --> 00:23:04.868
and going to the next level.

551
00:23:04.868 --> 00:23:08.828
So any place where the energy's really dense and heavy

552
00:23:08.828 --> 00:23:12.348
and a lot of energy psychometrized in the land that's

553
00:23:12.348 --> 00:23:15.388
not evolving, is that they came down and they just

554
00:23:15.388 --> 00:23:17.448
totally shifted that energy there.

555
00:23:17.448 --> 00:23:19.508
<v ->So we have to get rid of any kind of attachment</v>

556
00:23:19.508 --> 00:23:20.368
to suffering?

557
00:23:20.368 --> 00:23:20.948
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

558
00:23:20.948 --> 00:23:24.028
<v ->Any attachment to suffering at the hands of others</v>

559
00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:26.928
or perpetuating suffering on to others.

560
00:23:26.928 --> 00:23:29.248
<v ->Exactly, or you know experiencing God through suffering.</v>

561
00:23:29.248 --> 00:23:29.948
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

562
00:23:29.948 --> 00:23:31.928
<v ->You know things like that, you know, and it's</v>

563
00:23:31.928 --> 00:23:36.297
ultimate expression basically, God is just pure bliss.

564
00:23:36.297 --> 00:23:36.897
<v ->Yeah.</v>

565
00:23:36.897 --> 00:23:38.136
<v ->So how does suffering...</v>

566
00:23:38.136 --> 00:23:40.876
Does God want you to suffer?

567
00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:42.056
No, you know.

568
00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:43.476
<v ->So that was an amazing...</v>

569
00:23:43.476 --> 00:23:46.416
I love that, we posted that the second we saw it.

570
00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:49.956
It just made us giddy to watch that, the E.T. experience,

571
00:23:49.956 --> 00:23:51.996
the UFO experience over there.
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

572
00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:54.616
<v ->So that was one example you say where they're</v>

573
00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:57.616
starting to work with the land itself.

574
00:23:57.616 --> 00:23:59.596
Beginning to help release some of the trauma

575
00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:00.835
that's embedded in the land.

576
00:24:00.835 --> 00:24:01.416
<v ->Exactly.</v>

577
00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:02.936
<v ->Psychometrized into the land as you say.</v>

578
00:24:02.936 --> 00:24:06.076
<v ->And they're working on the grids you know?</v>

579
00:24:06.076 --> 00:24:09.356
There's energy grids here and grids of consciousness

580
00:24:09.356 --> 00:24:10.716
and collective consciousness.

581
00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:12.556
And so they're working on those grids and

582
00:24:12.556 --> 00:24:15.935
just by them being here, their consciousness

583
00:24:15.935 --> 00:24:17.996
is changing the grid.

584
00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:21.616
And they're also doing it with the natural flows.

585
00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:26.456
You know, they're very much behind the ninth wave

586
00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:29.216
of unity consciousness, that the Mayans talk about.

587
00:24:29.216 --> 00:24:33.016
You know, they work with nature and they work

588
00:24:33.016 --> 00:24:34.616
with these natural flows.

589
00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:38.556
And the natural evolutionary processes as well.

590
00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:41.616
So I asked some of the Mayan...

591
00:24:41.616 --> 00:24:43.636
You know I was talking about the Mayan calendar

592
00:24:43.636 --> 00:24:45.176
and asked Carl Calleman about it.

593
00:24:45.176 --> 00:24:46.156
I said what...

594
00:24:46.156 --> 00:24:50.155
You know, I said I pretty much know where the

595
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.514
Mayan calendar came from, but I'd love for you to ask

596
00:24:52.514 --> 00:24:56.375
you know, Carl where did it come from?

597
00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:57.435
Where did you get it?

598
00:24:57.435 --> 00:25:01.515
I mean whoever made this calendar had total

599
00:25:01.515 --> 00:25:03.135
time travel capabilities.

600
00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:04.655
They could forward or backward in time.

601
00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:06.834
They knew the natural cycles, they knew everything.

602
00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:09.055
And he said the Platians gave it to us.

603
00:25:09.055 --> 00:25:12.735
<v ->Very interesting, you know I wanna bring this up,</v>

604
00:25:12.735 --> 00:25:13.555
this is perfect.

605
00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:17.035
About a year ago I had a conversation with Jose Aguillas

606
00:25:17.035 --> 00:25:19.235
and we were talking about the calendar.

607
00:25:19.235 --> 00:25:21.195
But we went into a place that he doesn't

608
00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:23.154
normally go into, certainly not on camera.

609
00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:26.994
And he said, there was...

610
00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:30.014
The reason the Mayan calendar's important is because

611
00:25:30.014 --> 00:25:34.434
the Gregorian calendar took us away from a natural

612
00:25:34.434 --> 00:25:36.314
flow of time and space.

613
00:25:36.314 --> 00:25:39.814
The Gregorian calendar was inserted into

614
00:25:39.814 --> 00:25:43.154
consciousness, into culture to break us from

615
00:25:43.154 --> 00:25:44.174
the natural rhythms.

616
00:25:44.174 --> 00:25:46.103
Again, part of creating schisms.

617
00:25:46.103 --> 00:25:46.703
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

618
00:25:46.703 --> 00:25:48.782
<v ->And I asked him and I said are you talking about</v>

619
00:25:48.782 --> 00:25:51.762
from external forces?

620
00:25:51.762 --> 00:25:55.622
He said, absolutely, that it was inserted

621
00:25:55.622 --> 00:25:59.902
by a particular species to keep us within

622
00:25:59.902 --> 00:26:02.302
this broken reference of time.

623
00:26:02.302 --> 00:26:05.482
Of broken reference of natural cycles.

624
00:26:05.482 --> 00:26:08.022
And that the Mayan calendar and it's resurgence

625
00:26:08.022 --> 00:26:11.062
was really here at this time to help put us back

626
00:26:11.062 --> 00:26:12.482
into the natural flow.

627
00:26:12.482 --> 00:26:13.302
<v ->Exactly.</v>

628
00:26:13.302 --> 00:26:15.462
<v ->And that makes total sense.</v>

629
00:26:15.462 --> 00:26:16.922
<v ->And another thing the Pleiadians were saying,</v>

630
00:26:16.922 --> 00:26:19.142
they said that this planet was actually

631
00:26:19.142 --> 00:26:20.902
created as an Eden.

632
00:26:20.902 --> 00:26:25.542
For evolution to reach it's highest level

633
00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:26.522
in the third dimension.

634
00:26:26.522 --> 00:26:28.642
That was what it was created for.

635
00:26:28.642 --> 00:26:32.342
And so for not just the people here to evolve to the

636
00:26:32.342 --> 00:26:37.002
highest level of evolution, but their highest potential,

637
00:26:37.002 --> 00:26:39.502
but the plants and animals and everything else.

638
00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:43.142
You know it's a major biological zoo.

639
00:26:43.142 --> 00:26:46.102
There's genetics from at least twelve

640
00:26:46.102 --> 00:26:47.902
different star nations here.

641
00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:49.762
Including human genetics as well.

642
00:26:49.762 --> 00:26:51.782
And the genome experiment has brought that out.

643
00:26:51.782 --> 00:26:53.702
Although they keep trying to cover it up.

644
00:26:53.702 --> 00:26:56.822
But my nephew worked on the Genome experiment

645
00:26:56.822 --> 00:26:58.242
so I know what's going on there.

646
00:26:58.242 --> 00:26:59.482
<v ->Care to share anything?</v>

647
00:26:59.482 --> 00:27:00.882
Just worth dropping it in.

648
00:27:00.882 --> 00:27:03.402
<v ->Well basically he said that you know, there's no way</v>

649
00:27:03.402 --> 00:27:07.362
that all the genetics both human and plant and everything

650
00:27:07.362 --> 00:27:09.922
else could've happened naturally.

651
00:27:09.922 --> 00:27:13.742
I mean things evolve, but they said at the time

652
00:27:13.742 --> 00:27:17.742
it would take for things to come about, there's extreme

653
00:27:17.742 --> 00:27:19.182
diversity and everything else.

654
00:27:19.182 --> 00:27:21.862
And what they're seeing in the human genome as well

655
00:27:21.862 --> 00:27:24.862
that there is a lot of tinkering going on and a lot

656
00:27:24.862 --> 00:27:27.302
of things brought here.

657
00:27:27.302 --> 00:27:29.002
<v ->And that's coming from the world of science.</v>

658
00:27:29.002 --> 00:27:30.942
<v ->Yeah, exactly.
<v ->I just wanted to let you say that.</v>

659
00:27:30.942 --> 00:27:33.642
<v ->Yeah now they're saying, okay you know, a lot</v>

660
00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:35.542
of things were brought here, they didn't evolve

661
00:27:35.542 --> 00:27:36.902
naturally on this planet.

662
00:27:36.902 --> 00:27:39.382
And there's been a lot of tinkering with

663
00:27:39.382 --> 00:27:40.722
genetics here on every level.

664
00:27:40.722 --> 00:27:44.762
<v ->Okay so the Pleiadians, that's a wonderful</v>

665
00:27:44.762 --> 00:27:47.642
vision and understanding of what the

666
00:27:47.642 --> 00:27:49.051
Pleiadians are bringing.

667
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:50.528
I mean when you get into some of Dolores Cannon's

668
00:27:50.528 --> 00:27:53.408
work and some of the deep, deep past and some

669
00:27:53.408 --> 00:27:55.688
reparations that are being done supposedly.

670
00:27:55.688 --> 00:27:58.008
That's a very lovely place to come to.

671
00:27:58.008 --> 00:28:02.048
<v ->And what they said is that there's a new</v>

672
00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:05.108
shift that's happened, where they're gonna return.

673
00:28:05.108 --> 00:28:07.308
And they're gonna restore the planet back on it's

674
00:28:07.308 --> 00:28:10.108
original setting, which is nice.

675
00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:13.248
And you know, all the prophecies talk about this.

676
00:28:13.248 --> 00:28:14.928
All the Native American prophecies.

677
00:28:14.928 --> 00:28:16.648
Everywhere you go, they talk about this

678
00:28:16.648 --> 00:28:18.208
huge shift that happens.

679
00:28:18.208 --> 00:28:20.328
And they're part of that shift.

680
00:28:20.328 --> 00:28:22.128
And it's also a natural cycle too.

681
00:28:22.128 --> 00:28:24.148
It's an evolutionary cycle, but they're helping

682
00:28:24.148 --> 00:28:26.868
getting things back on track again.

683
00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:27.828
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

684
00:28:27.828 --> 00:28:31.188
How tall are the beings?

685
00:28:31.188 --> 00:28:33.548
The Pleiadians when they're viewed.

686
00:28:33.548 --> 00:28:38.548
<v ->Yeah the ones that I've seen are, most of them</v>

687
00:28:38.608 --> 00:28:39.928
are a little taller than we are.

688
00:28:39.928 --> 00:28:40.488
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

689
00:28:40.488 --> 00:28:41.748
<v ->You know, a little taller.</v>

690
00:28:41.748 --> 00:28:43.668
They're very genetically refined.

691
00:28:43.668 --> 00:28:44.707
You know very beautiful.

692
00:28:44.707 --> 00:28:45.487
<v ->Very beautiful.</v>

693
00:28:45.487 --> 00:28:50.326
<v ->And those are the ones that are in our dimension.</v>

694
00:28:50.326 --> 00:28:52.666
There are some that are much taller.

695
00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:54.787
There's some beings out there that are much taller.

696
00:28:54.787 --> 00:28:58.207
Some beings are eight feet tall, you know.

697
00:28:58.207 --> 00:29:00.207
Some are even bigger than that.

698
00:29:00.207 --> 00:29:02.187
I mean they found footprints of beings

699
00:29:02.187 --> 00:29:03.327
that are 30 feet tall.

700
00:29:03.327 --> 00:29:03.967
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

701
00:29:03.967 --> 00:29:07.527
<v ->And some of the ancient Larians were 24 feet tall</v>

702
00:29:07.527 --> 00:29:09.467
to 27 feet tall, so...
<v ->Yes.</v>

703
00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:12.967
<v ->So when you adjust to the planet, when you go to</v>

704
00:29:12.967 --> 00:29:15.747
a planet even if you are a very big being,

705
00:29:15.747 --> 00:29:18.267
there's something that happens where you adjust

706
00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:21.547
to the planetary energies.
<v ->To scale?</v>

707
00:29:21.547 --> 00:29:23.787
You scale to what's necessary for that experience.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

708
00:29:23.787 --> 00:29:27.147
<v ->So is there anything more on the Pleiadians</v>

709
00:29:27.147 --> 00:29:28.947
or do we want to continue on?

710
00:29:28.947 --> 00:29:29.847
Maybe to...

711
00:29:29.847 --> 00:29:32.147
<v ->What I thought was interesting and I'll share</v>

712
00:29:32.147 --> 00:29:32.947
an experience with you.

713
00:29:32.947 --> 00:29:34.607
I connect with this being.

714
00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:37.347
And we are multi-dimensional beings so we have

715
00:29:37.347 --> 00:29:38.846
other lives going on.

716
00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:41.167
Which is really interesting.

717
00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:44.986
And I connected this being, I'm very connected to her

718
00:29:44.986 --> 00:29:46.647
by the name of Plumeria.

719
00:29:46.647 --> 00:29:47.867
And so I'm going...

720
00:29:47.867 --> 00:29:50.487
And when I was in Hawaii I kept smelling these flowers,

721
00:29:50.487 --> 00:29:52.607
Plumeria, and I would just go off on them.

722
00:29:52.607 --> 00:29:53.647
<v ->It's a beautiful scent.</v>

723
00:29:53.647 --> 00:29:55.726
<v ->I go, God I just love this scent.</v>

724
00:29:55.726 --> 00:29:58.107
I don't know why, I can't figure out why I'm

725
00:29:58.107 --> 00:30:00.687
so enamored with this scent.

726
00:30:00.687 --> 00:30:04.767
And then you know I didn't even know

727
00:30:04.767 --> 00:30:07.976
about the flower, you know, before.

728
00:30:07.976 --> 00:30:12.976
And then I found out this female that I just fell

729
00:30:13.976 --> 00:30:16.716
in love with basically was her name was Plumeria.

730
00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:19.176
And I'm really connected to her on another level.

731
00:30:19.176 --> 00:30:21.276
There's another thing going on another level there.

732
00:30:21.276 --> 00:30:23.096
<v ->Now is this a human person?</v>

733
00:30:23.096 --> 00:30:23.736
<v ->Yeah.</v>

734
00:30:23.736 --> 00:30:24.276
<v ->Okay.</v>

735
00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:26.463
<v ->Pleiadian, she's Pleiadian basically.</v>

736
00:30:26.463 --> 00:30:26.863
<v ->Yeah.</v>

737
00:30:26.863 --> 00:30:31.117
<v ->And so I asked her, I said well why did</v>

738
00:30:31.117 --> 00:30:32.977
they name you Plumeria like this?

739
00:30:32.977 --> 00:30:35.017
And she said my father created it.

740
00:30:35.017 --> 00:30:36.197
<v ->Aww.</v>

741
00:30:36.197 --> 00:30:39.237
<v ->And so I said, your father's been around</v>

742
00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.193
a long time hasn't he, you know?

743
00:30:41.193 --> 00:30:43.013
And they lived thousands of years.

744
00:30:43.013 --> 00:30:45.673
Some of them do, some of them are almost

745
00:30:45.673 --> 00:30:48.753
eternal, some live a thousand years or more.

746
00:30:48.753 --> 00:30:53.753
So basically he named her after the flower.

747
00:30:54.893 --> 00:30:58.453
And you think about that and you go wow

748
00:30:58.453 --> 00:31:00.393
these guys have been around a long time.

749
00:31:00.393 --> 00:31:02.453
And tinkering with.

750
00:31:02.453 --> 00:31:05.893
And that's what they do, they create life.

751
00:31:05.893 --> 00:31:06.993
<v ->And beauty.</v>

752
00:31:06.993 --> 00:31:11.993
<v ->Exactly and so it all tied...</v>

753
00:31:12.012 --> 00:31:13.933
When I thought about it, I said, God these guys

754
00:31:13.933 --> 00:31:17.253
have been terraforming.

755
00:31:17.253 --> 00:31:19.133
And they've been working with planets

756
00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:23.333
and genetics for thousands and thousands of years.

757
00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:25.393
You know probably millions of years.

758
00:31:25.393 --> 00:31:26.273
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

759
00:31:26.273 --> 00:31:27.793
<v ->From what I understand, so.</v>

760
00:31:27.793 --> 00:31:31.513
<v ->And Pleiadians are probably the most commonly known.</v>

761
00:31:31.513 --> 00:31:33.993
Certainly the grays, the reptilians, the Pleiadians

762
00:31:33.993 --> 00:31:34.973
are the most commonly known.

763
00:31:34.973 --> 00:31:36.773
What are some of the other beings you've encountered

764
00:31:36.773 --> 00:31:38.493
that are maybe less commonly known.

765
00:31:38.493 --> 00:31:40.353
Who are the ones with the feline faces?

766
00:31:40.353 --> 00:31:43.053
<v ->The felines, yeah, there's fifth dimensional</v>

767
00:31:43.053 --> 00:31:45.833
felines, six dimensional, and seventh dimensional

768
00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:47.013
that I've experienced.

769
00:31:47.013 --> 00:31:50.653
There could be more I don't know, but the ones...

770
00:31:50.653 --> 00:31:53.293
The fifth dimension ones, what happened was I went

771
00:31:53.293 --> 00:31:58.193
out of body on a ship and I was just doing a deep

772
00:31:58.193 --> 00:32:01.393
meditation and I just started thinking about

773
00:32:01.393 --> 00:32:03.333
these ships up there and who's on them.

774
00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:04.613
And the next you know, I was on it.

775
00:32:04.613 --> 00:32:06.773
And you know we have a physical body

776
00:32:06.773 --> 00:32:10.793
and a personality, but we're really a spirit

777
00:32:10.793 --> 00:32:12.853
that can go anywhere once we realize that.

778
00:32:12.853 --> 00:32:14.521
Once we get unhooked a little bit.

779
00:32:14.521 --> 00:32:18.022
And so I ended up on this ship and I just saw

780
00:32:18.022 --> 00:32:20.062
this beautiful blonde with her back to me.

781
00:32:20.062 --> 00:32:21.942
And I was going whoa who's that?

782
00:32:21.942 --> 00:32:23.442
<v ->You're still a guy.</v>

783
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:25.962
<v ->Exactly and so I just looked at her and</v>

784
00:32:25.962 --> 00:32:27.922
she just looked beautiful from the back.

785
00:32:27.922 --> 00:32:32.922
And she stands up, incredible, beautiful body.

786
00:32:33.022 --> 00:32:34.962
Everything stands up and turns around and

787
00:32:34.962 --> 00:32:38.302
she's got more of a cat human face.

788
00:32:38.302 --> 00:32:40.422
<v ->Yes with little kitty ears.</v>

789
00:32:40.422 --> 00:32:42.522
<v ->Yeah and she just runs to me and just</v>

790
00:32:42.522 --> 00:32:46.922
gives me this big hug, like long lost brotherly hug.

791
00:32:46.922 --> 00:32:49.962
It was the most loving thing, I just melted.

792
00:32:49.962 --> 00:32:53.182
And I didn't have a chance to even deal with the

793
00:32:53.182 --> 00:32:55.462
fact that this was a feline.

794
00:32:55.462 --> 00:32:57.902
This was a humanoid feline being.

795
00:32:57.902 --> 00:33:00.462
<v ->And most people think you're absolutely crazy.</v>

796
00:33:00.462 --> 00:33:03.162
This has come up a lot throughout history.

797
00:33:03.162 --> 00:33:07.022
It is in certainly some of the artwork of the Egyptians.

798
00:33:07.022 --> 00:33:11.022
It's come in photographs that have phased in

799
00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.342
here around the property.

800
00:33:12.342 --> 00:33:14.742
<v ->Exactly and you know we have pictures of the</v>

801
00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:16.102
sixth dimensional felines.

802
00:33:16.102 --> 00:33:17.902
And I've had paintings done of the other ones.

803
00:33:17.902 --> 00:33:20.622
And I did research on it after that and I found out

804
00:33:20.622 --> 00:33:24.462
that in ancient times they called them Narsingra in India.

805
00:33:24.462 --> 00:33:25.682
They were the benevolent protectors.

806
00:33:25.682 --> 00:33:27.382
And they prayed to Narsringa.

807
00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:31.562
And you had Sekma in Egypt.

808
00:33:31.562 --> 00:33:32.142
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

809
00:33:32.142 --> 00:33:34.802
<v ->Which was more of a lion, more of the lion type.</v>

810
00:33:34.802 --> 00:33:39.562
And then you have, is it Bost or something?

811
00:33:39.562 --> 00:33:43.022
But there's all these different feline beings, you know?

812
00:33:43.022 --> 00:33:45.242
The jaguar and it's like...

813
00:33:45.242 --> 00:33:48.082
And what I noticed about these beings is some of

814
00:33:48.082 --> 00:33:51.562
them can go down on all fours and just move.

815
00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:54.422
I mean, they can run on two legs or on all fours.

816
00:33:54.422 --> 00:33:56.662
They're incredibly agile.

817
00:33:56.662 --> 00:33:59.122
You know, very graceful, very agile.

818
00:33:59.122 --> 00:34:01.802
<v ->Is there a consistency to the kind of energy</v>

819
00:34:01.802 --> 00:34:04.442
and the information that they bring, regardless

820
00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:05.822
of which dimension they're from?

821
00:34:05.822 --> 00:34:09.822
<v ->It is, the consistency is you just feel</v>

822
00:34:09.822 --> 00:34:11.362
this love emanating from them.

823
00:34:11.362 --> 00:34:14.622
And some of them are a little more playful you know?

824
00:34:14.622 --> 00:34:17.302
Some are more playful and just wanna have fun.

825
00:34:17.302 --> 00:34:19.682
And some are more down to business.

826
00:34:19.682 --> 00:34:22.162
But they're all in service.

827
00:34:22.162 --> 00:34:25.122
That's what I've noticed, that they're all in service mode.

828
00:34:25.122 --> 00:34:27.382
And some are initiators, you know?

829
00:34:27.382 --> 00:34:29.251
They don't mess around.

830
00:34:29.251 --> 00:34:31.791
They just come in and boom, and you blow open.

831
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.471
And all of a sudden, you have all your memories back.

832
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:37.731
And they're very intense.

833
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:39.431
And then they're done, they move on.

834
00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:41.291
You know, to work with somebody else.

835
00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:44.131
And then some you have lifelong connections

836
00:34:44.131 --> 00:34:46.431
and other life connections and things like that

837
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:48.590
that you carry with you.

838
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.610
And you connect with them again and that's

839
00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:55.731
what I see is that we have to get away from...

840
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:58.231
You know I said in the talk, we have to get

841
00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:01.131
out of this meat sack program that we're doing you know?
<v ->Yes.</v>

842
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:03.771
<v ->Is that you're not just a meat sack here.</v>

843
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:08.151
You know, you're basically a spirit and you're

844
00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:09.449
a multidimensional spirit.

845
00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:10.889
And you've been around forever.

846
00:35:10.889 --> 00:35:12.449
And you've been these other beings.

847
00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:15.809
And your spirit has inhabited these other bodies.

848
00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:19.588
And so when we understand that and really accept that

849
00:35:19.588 --> 00:35:23.069
then we can start having all of these other experiences

850
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:24.289
'cause we're ready for it.

851
00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:29.289
And we just have to get away from this exclusivity

852
00:35:29.429 --> 00:35:32.288
box game we have going on, separation game.

853
00:35:32.288 --> 00:35:34.549
<v ->Which is been perpetuated with intention to keep</v>

854
00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:36.509
us in this very small mind set.

855
00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:39.749
And need to discover that multidimensional aspect.

856
00:35:39.749 --> 00:35:41.589
<v ->You know, nobody has an exclusive on God</v>

857
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:43.129
or E.T.'s or anything else.

858
00:35:43.129 --> 00:35:44.429
There's a lot of them that say they do.

859
00:35:44.429 --> 00:35:47.909
And they are the way, and the path.

860
00:35:47.909 --> 00:35:49.569
And everything else.

861
00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:52.009
But it's a way, and a path.

862
00:35:52.009 --> 00:35:52.629
<v ->Yes.</v>

863
00:35:52.629 --> 00:35:53.669
<v ->But it's not...</v>

864
00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:55.449
There's no exclusives.

865
00:35:55.449 --> 00:36:00.449
<v ->And there's a lot of confusion going back into</v>

866
00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:02.509
multidimensionality versus something with

867
00:36:02.509 --> 00:36:04.249
dimension and density that we can see

868
00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:06.289
as third dimensional bodies and

869
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.089
sensory systems as this time.

870
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:10.588
And the notion that we can see the Pleiadians

871
00:36:10.588 --> 00:36:13.189
with our eyes, however the beings, when they

872
00:36:13.189 --> 00:36:15.169
come here, are not of that dimension.

873
00:36:15.169 --> 00:36:17.549
<v ->No, they do a jump.</v>

874
00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:19.189
<v ->The earth is multidimensional.</v>

875
00:36:19.189 --> 00:36:23.049
The Pleiadian planet's those are multidimensional.

876
00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:23.749
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

877
00:36:23.749 --> 00:36:25.549
<v ->So maybe talk about this a little bit.</v>

878
00:36:25.549 --> 00:36:27.708
And let's talk about the Arcturions.

879
00:36:27.708 --> 00:36:30.149
Let's talk about this notion of density you can see

880
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:32.969
and beings that are not of that density that show up here.

881
00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:36.109
<v ->Yeah, what's happened is there's worlds within</v>

882
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:38.409
worlds within worlds and timelines and all

883
00:36:38.409 --> 00:36:39.689
these other things going on.

884
00:36:39.689 --> 00:36:42.948
It's not just this little 3D physical reality.

885
00:36:42.948 --> 00:36:45.608
And we see a little tiny piece of the visible

886
00:36:45.608 --> 00:36:47.609
light spectrum, basically is all we can see,

887
00:36:47.609 --> 00:36:49.149
and experience.

888
00:36:49.149 --> 00:36:51.629
But there's things going on all around us always.

889
00:36:51.629 --> 00:36:54.709
And your eyes are picking up billions of bits

890
00:36:54.709 --> 00:36:56.969
of information, but your brain is choosing

891
00:36:56.969 --> 00:36:59.249
out of that what's gonna be it's reality.

892
00:36:59.249 --> 00:37:00.938
What it has reference points for.

893
00:37:00.938 --> 00:37:04.298
And so there's a big misnomer of,

894
00:37:04.298 --> 00:37:05.817
"I'll believe it when I see it."

895
00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:07.777
It actually has been reversed.

896
00:37:07.777 --> 00:37:08.577
<v ->Exactly.</v>

897
00:37:08.577 --> 00:37:10.038
<v ->You have to be open to it and aware</v>

898
00:37:10.038 --> 00:37:11.058
of what's out there.

899
00:37:11.058 --> 00:37:13.077
And then you start having the experiences.

900
00:37:13.077 --> 00:37:17.698
But there's going on here, I mean we have little

901
00:37:17.698 --> 00:37:20.738
beings, you know little fairies and gnomes

902
00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.818
and things like that cruising around here all the time.

903
00:37:22.818 --> 00:37:24.698
Some people actually see them.

904
00:37:24.698 --> 00:37:25.858
A lot of the kids see them.

905
00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:27.718
And some people photograph them.

906
00:37:27.718 --> 00:37:29.818
Get photographs of them and things like that.

907
00:37:29.818 --> 00:37:32.998
There's masters walking around on the property.

908
00:37:32.998 --> 00:37:34.758
<v ->Yes I saw that the other night.</v>

909
00:37:34.758 --> 00:37:39.758
I saw some rather tall beautiful kind of a lavender

910
00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:42.757
violet beings walking amongst the people.

911
00:37:42.757 --> 00:37:45.697
<v ->Oh yeah, we have photographs of a woman</v>

912
00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:47.737
sitting in her chair and she's just totally engulfed

913
00:37:47.737 --> 00:37:49.637
in this beautiful lavender energy.

914
00:37:49.637 --> 00:37:52.617
<v ->Oh okay, so my mind wasn't playing tricks on me here.</v>

915
00:37:52.617 --> 00:37:54.217
<v ->No, no they got a bunch of photographs.</v>

916
00:37:54.217 --> 00:37:56.917
When we did the Intention experiment, all this energy

917
00:37:56.917 --> 00:38:00.174
dropped down in and this multidimensional energy came in

918
00:38:00.933 --> 00:38:03.493
So that was quite interesting.

919
00:38:03.493 --> 00:38:05.032
<v ->When I was looking at that...</v>

920
00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:08.072
What it seemed is that these beings were simply

921
00:38:08.072 --> 00:38:10.753
very gently walking amongst everyone.

922
00:38:10.753 --> 00:38:11.251
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

923
00:38:11.251 --> 00:38:14.551
<v ->And as you're experiencing them, it only comes</v>

924
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:17.671
more in the form of heightened awareness

925
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:20.131
or understanding or able to take and assimilate

926
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.971
information on a higher level.

927
00:38:21.971 --> 00:38:23.491
And their presence was allowing that.

928
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:26.471
<v ->Exactly and after it happened the woman.</v>

929
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.449
You know the woman it happened to, I talked to her

930
00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:30.409
and she said, "This is so weird."

931
00:38:30.409 --> 00:38:32.449
She goes, "After that happened to me, I'm like

932
00:38:32.449 --> 00:38:33.409
"talking to trees."

933
00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:36.449
And you know she said that, "I'm finding that

934
00:38:36.449 --> 00:38:38.349
"everything is alive, everything is conscious."

935
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:40.529
And she goes, "I don't know what to do with this."
<v ->Amazing.</v>

936
00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:43.528
<v ->And I said well just have fun with it.</v>

937
00:38:43.528 --> 00:38:46.629
You know, don't be attached, just flow with it.

938
00:38:46.629 --> 00:38:48.209
<v ->That's wonderful.</v>

939
00:38:48.209 --> 00:38:49.369
<v ->I said there's nothing wrong with you,</v>

940
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:50.709
that everything is conscious.

941
00:38:50.709 --> 00:38:52.729
If you get back into the most ancient times,

942
00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:55.389
they knew that, you know, they're fully aware.

943
00:38:55.389 --> 00:38:57.129
<v ->So there's one of the violet beings and then you</v>

944
00:38:57.129 --> 00:38:58.209
have the little fairies.

945
00:38:58.209 --> 00:38:59.929
And do they look like little fairies?

946
00:38:59.929 --> 00:39:02.369
Or what do these little tiny beings look like?

947
00:39:02.369 --> 00:39:04.749
<v ->Yeah there are little nature spirits flying around here</v>

948
00:39:04.749 --> 00:39:06.489
and they've got the wings and everything else.

949
00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:07.869
I had a psychologist here.

950
00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:12.149
And she didn't believe in any of this stuff basically.

951
00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:13.649
And one flew right up in her face.

952
00:39:13.649 --> 00:39:15.229
And was sitting there fluttering.

953
00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:18.889
And she had a man next to her and they both saw it.

954
00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.709
And she goes, it freaked her out.

955
00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:25.189
She goes, "This is crazy, I can't believe this."

956
00:39:25.189 --> 00:39:27.969
She goes, "I medicate people for this you know?"

957
00:39:27.969 --> 00:39:31.189
<v ->Now what an eye opener that is for her.</v>

958
00:39:31.189 --> 00:39:33.609
How must that have changed her practice in life.

959
00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:34.669
<v ->And I told her that.</v>

960
00:39:34.669 --> 00:39:38.889
I said, you know what, you need to stop

961
00:39:38.889 --> 00:39:41.449
medicating people and start supporting people.

962
00:39:41.449 --> 00:39:44.019
In these experiences, because...

963
00:39:44.238 --> 00:39:45.638
I said you have a choice now.

964
00:39:45.638 --> 00:39:47.338
You're either gonna have to medicate yourself

965
00:39:47.338 --> 00:39:51.498
or you're gonna have to start changing the nature

966
00:39:51.498 --> 00:39:52.318
of your work.

967
00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:54.578
<v ->Yeah that was good that you were</v>

968
00:39:54.578 --> 00:39:56.537
bold enough to say that to her, absolutely.

969
00:39:56.537 --> 00:39:59.198
Well now what about the Arcturians.

970
00:39:59.198 --> 00:40:00.717
I brought it up a couple times 'cause you don't

971
00:40:00.717 --> 00:40:03.277
hear that often, about the Arcturions.

972
00:40:03.277 --> 00:40:07.097
<v ->They're very, very advanced beings.</v>

973
00:40:07.097 --> 00:40:11.138
One of them that I saw, was wearing robes.

974
00:40:11.138 --> 00:40:13.057
More of an energy being that I saw.

975
00:40:13.057 --> 00:40:15.098
And when you looked into his eyes,

976
00:40:15.098 --> 00:40:17.238
there was clouds moving by.

977
00:40:17.238 --> 00:40:20.778
There was like a whole universe inside of this being

978
00:40:20.778 --> 00:40:21.978
or something it was really...

979
00:40:21.978 --> 00:40:23.378
<v ->And they're often big and blue.</v>

980
00:40:23.378 --> 00:40:24.118
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

981
00:40:24.118 --> 00:40:25.298
And there's different...

982
00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:28.378
What's happening is like when we say in andromnids.

983
00:40:28.378 --> 00:40:30.958
People go, well what are the androminids look like?

984
00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:33.938
Well I've seen some of them that are mythologically

985
00:40:33.938 --> 00:40:34.938
known as archangels.

986
00:40:34.938 --> 00:40:37.178
They have magnetized light bodies.

987
00:40:37.178 --> 00:40:39.638
They have huge energy bands coming out behind them.

988
00:40:39.638 --> 00:40:43.938
Very powerful beings that come in.

989
00:40:43.938 --> 00:40:45.318
Then there's some blue ones.

990
00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:47.257
And there's some little andromonids.

991
00:40:47.257 --> 00:40:49.038
You know there's some small little beings.

992
00:40:49.038 --> 00:40:49.998
<v ->Oh interesting, mmhmm.</v>

993
00:40:49.998 --> 00:40:51.198
<v ->You know, so it's a big galaxy.</v>

994
00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:52.398
And we can't pigeonhole.

995
00:40:52.398 --> 00:40:54.157
Just like Orion, you know, there's an Orion

996
00:40:54.157 --> 00:40:56.397
Council of Light and there's some beings that

997
00:40:56.397 --> 00:40:58.037
aren't so friendly that come from Orion.

998
00:40:58.037 --> 00:41:00.597
<v ->Yes and that's where the confusion comes in.</v>

999
00:41:00.597 --> 00:41:01.157
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1000
00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:02.777
<v ->And that's really where when we started this</v>

1001
00:41:02.777 --> 00:41:05.457
conversation, it comes down to where is your own

1002
00:41:05.457 --> 00:41:07.377
heart and mind, what is it aligned with?

1003
00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:09.637
And that's what you're going to experience.

1004
00:41:09.637 --> 00:41:11.377
<v ->And also self authority too.</v>

1005
00:41:11.377 --> 00:41:13.597
Learning discernments, spiritual discernment.

1006
00:41:13.597 --> 00:41:15.918
Learning how to heal unseen negative

1007
00:41:15.918 --> 00:41:18.677
influences and setting boundaries and remaining

1008
00:41:18.677 --> 00:41:21.777
in your own self authority are very important if you're

1009
00:41:21.777 --> 00:41:23.637
gonna playing in these other dimensions.

1010
00:41:23.637 --> 00:41:26.037
<v ->Absolutely, well James any final thoughts?</v>

1011
00:41:26.037 --> 00:41:27.777
I know you have Carol Rossen's gonna be

1012
00:41:27.777 --> 00:41:30.577
beaming in, where is from, southern cal or Ecuador?

1013
00:41:30.577 --> 00:41:33.896
<v ->I think she's in Oregon now.</v>

1014
00:41:33.896 --> 00:41:34.656
<v ->Oh she's in Oregon?</v>

1015
00:41:34.656 --> 00:41:36.655
Okay so she's coming in via live streaming

1016
00:41:36.655 --> 00:41:37.595
in a few minutes here.

1017
00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.055
Any final thoughts?

1018
00:41:39.055 --> 00:41:39.835
I just...

1019
00:41:39.835 --> 00:41:42.195
I've been looking forward to this conversation

1020
00:41:42.195 --> 00:41:43.215
with you on camera.

1021
00:41:43.215 --> 00:41:43.874
<v ->Oh yeah?</v>

1022
00:41:43.874 --> 00:41:47.215
Well basically we are in for a wild ride here.

1023
00:41:47.215 --> 00:41:48.855
And it's an interdimensional one.

1024
00:41:48.855 --> 00:41:50.895
And we're gonna see change on every level.

1025
00:41:50.895 --> 00:41:53.215
So it's important that everybody make their

1026
00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:55.695
own personal connection with source or spirit.

1027
00:41:55.695 --> 00:41:57.735
And develop their own inner guidance.

1028
00:41:57.735 --> 00:42:00.355
And go with that flow you know?

1029
00:42:00.355 --> 00:42:04.195
Prepare with loving attachment or detachment,

1030
00:42:04.195 --> 00:42:05.995
on every level.

1031
00:42:05.995 --> 00:42:09.795
Because we are gonna be going with a major

1032
00:42:09.795 --> 00:42:11.175
flow of energy coming in.

1033
00:42:11.175 --> 00:42:12.355
And we have to go with it.

1034
00:42:12.355 --> 00:42:14.755
<v ->And you can choose the quality of that experience.</v>

1035
00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:16.635
<v ->Yeah, I always say the earth is ascending.</v>

1036
00:42:16.635 --> 00:42:18.175
She's moving to the next level.

1037
00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:20.035
And resistance is futile.

1038
00:42:20.035 --> 00:42:22.495
You're either gonna frequency specific and go with her

1039
00:42:22.495 --> 00:42:24.415
or not, you know.

1040
00:42:24.415 --> 00:42:25.715
<v ->You'll have another reality.</v>

1041
00:42:25.715 --> 00:42:27.255
<v ->You'll have another experience somewhere else.</v>

1042
00:42:27.255 --> 00:42:29.035
<v ->Yeah, thank you so much James.</v>

1043
00:42:29.035 --> 00:42:30.075
<v ->Alright, thank you.</v>

1044
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:35.204
<v ->For more background on James' life and work,</v>
