1
00:00:01.432 --> 00:00:03.725
<v ->While many people criticize the film industry</v>

2
00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:07.330
for offering bombastic, violent or vacuous programming,

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.527
I would like to applaud those producers who

4
00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:11.276
are making a difference in the world with

5
00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:13.473
offerings such as The Constant Gardner,

6
00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:16.097
Ceriana, Good night and Good Luck, and other films

7
00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:19.681
that give us a glimpse of a world hidden from view.

8
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.764
Film maker Robert Greenwald is among those brave producers

9
00:00:22.764 --> 00:00:24.555
who dare to speak out.

10
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:28.054
His documentaries Out Foxed and Uncovered: The Iraq War,

11
00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:30.827
paved the way for his newest film, Walmart:

12
00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:33.445
The High Cost of Low Price.

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.061
So you've been in the film and television scene

14
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.176
for about 30 years now from the beginning right?

15
00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:46.634
<v ->Well, yeah, I think, more than 30 probably.</v>

16
00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.074
<v Woman>Yeah, looking at your bio,</v>

17
00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:49.397
it's impressive.

18
00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:51.839
So you've been working regularly at this

19
00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.343
and I've noticed that throughout

20
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:54.623
your career there have been little spots

21
00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:57.919
where you've done content that

22
00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:01.097
would be considered consciousness raising,

23
00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:03.188
a little bit controversial and so forth.

24
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.204
Has this been incidental or have you been

25
00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:08.201
building up to where you are now all along?

26
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.569
<v ->Well, it's a good question.</v>

27
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:11.987
I think, at least for me,

28
00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:14.942
I never have a plan or a master plan.

29
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:18.323
I go, what interests me?

30
00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:20.051
What grabs my attention?

31
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:21.117
What's possible?

32
00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:22.760
I mean, film, it's not like writing a novel.

33
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.893
You can't make whatever film you want.

34
00:01:24.893 --> 00:01:28.007
You know, there's all those realities at there.

35
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.303
I think in general, I've always been interested

36
00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:34.599
in true stories even when I did the 50 some odd

37
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.394
narrative films with actors,

38
00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.335
I think 40, 45 of them are based

39
00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:42.865
on a real story or a real incident or something like that.

40
00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.446
So I think the evolution to documentaries

41
00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:49.041
has been inevitable looking back on it.

42
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.435
And most of them had something of substance

43
00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:56.230
in them, not all of them.

44
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.990
There are some duds in there that I would

45
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.248
like to take off the resume,

46
00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:00.432
but that happens.

47
00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:01.755
<v Woman>I'm sure it happens.</v>

48
00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.197
So now you're sort of taking the tiger by the tail

49
00:02:04.197 --> 00:02:05.541
as it were.

50
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.677
You've gone in the most recent movie out there,

51
00:02:08.677 --> 00:02:10.458
which I've seen a couple of times, by the way,

52
00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:11.919
the Walmart movie.

53
00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.786
The High Cost of Low Price Goods.

54
00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:17.658
What was your inspiration in going

55
00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:20.282
in this direction and Walmart specifically?

56
00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:24.388
<v ->Well, a friend of mine was working there</v>

57
00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:26.223
and talking to him, I started to find out about

58
00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:30.852
how bad they are from his point of view.

59
00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.049
And then as I started doing research,

60
00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.491
a couple of things really jumped out at me.

61
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:37.763
One was the Walton family,

62
00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:39.534
worth a hundred billion dollars,

63
00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.646
juxtapose that with the fact they don't give

64
00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:43.736
health care to people.

65
00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:46.541
And that's such an emotional issue for me.

66
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.258
Every time I go to the doctor,

67
00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:51.330
I'm aware of how lucky I am to be able to afford it

68
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.901
and the fact that people with so much money

69
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:57.965
that they could burn it won't give people

70
00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:01.772
the freedom to take care of themselves

71
00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:04.951
just made me furious.

72
00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.231
<v Woman>And just to be clear on that,</v>

73
00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:09.388
they have health care, but it's not the kind

74
00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:12.385
that necessarily is helpful to a person

75
00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.614
making minimum wage.

76
00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:15.937
<v ->They have health care that's outside</v>

77
00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:17.889
the range of a lot of the employees

78
00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.904
and then even when they can afford it,

79
00:03:19.904 --> 00:03:22.720
it's very limited in the choices it's offered.

80
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.067
And their own internal survey that

81
00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:26.848
was leaked a few months ago,

82
00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:30.474
indicated the single biggest dissatisfaction

83
00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:33.376
among their employees is over the health care.

84
00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:35.488
And over 50% of their employees

85
00:03:35.488 --> 00:03:39.455
don't have any, so they wind up going to the government.

86
00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:41.151
<v Woman>Yeah, government subsidized health care</v>

87
00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:43.018
as an employee of Walmart.

88
00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:46.729
The film was really quite moving.

89
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.745
I haven't gone there.

90
00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:50.516
I live in a small town where that's kind of the only

91
00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:51.902
retailer around because everything else

92
00:03:51.902 --> 00:03:53.460
has been closed down.

93
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.276
I certainly haven't gone there since seeing

94
00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:57.459
the film.

95
00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.361
You're really striking at the heart of what

96
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:03.123
were solid American values and we've

97
00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:06.856
let go because we all want cheap goods.

98
00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:10.067
<v ->We've certainly seen the destructive</v>

99
00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.712
thing of Walmart in small towns

100
00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:14.748
and closing up shops and all.

101
00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:19.623
I think that it's been a systemic attack

102
00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:22.994
by large corporations on a lot

103
00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:24.220
of what we believe in,

104
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.202
that's exactly what you say,

105
00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:26.386
good American values,

106
00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:29.329
and it's an issue that cuts across all political lines.

107
00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:34.329
And I was astounded and moved by the stories

108
00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:36.881
that we came up with because they were so different.

109
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.413
And at some point I thought I'd never finish the movie.

110
00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.335
I have 380 hours because Walmart

111
00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:46.450
abuses in so many areas.

112
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.020
We'd get one thing and they'd say

113
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.140
oh have you heard about this?

114
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.921
I'd say oh no, please, don't.

115
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.276
And then they'd say have you heard about this?

116
00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:56.177
It just kept growing and growing and growing.

117
00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:58.726
<v Woman>Well you certainly made a pretty complex portrait.</v>

118
00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:01.521
I think you covered a lot of issues in the documentary

119
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:04.582
which hopefully everybody, by the time they've finished

120
00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:06.651
this interview, will purchase.

121
00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:08.091
You've made it very affordable to people.

122
00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:11.131
I wanted to talk to you about the way

123
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:13.680
in which you went about getting this out to the public,

124
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.210
because this seems to be a new movement that's going on.

125
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.653
Can you talk about what your strategy was?

126
00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.858
It ended up in no time flat,

127
00:05:20.858 --> 00:05:23.087
something like 7,000 living rooms.

128
00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:25.455
So tell us what you had in mind,

129
00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:27.151
how you did this.

130
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:28.932
<v ->Well, I'll just backtrack it a little bit,</v>

131
00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:31.727
because it started with the other films I did, Uncovered,

132
00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:34.276
which is about the reasons for the war and Out Foxed,

133
00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:35.950
about Fox news.

134
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.198
<v Woman>Fabulous documentary.</v>

135
00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:38.020
<v ->Thank you.</v>

136
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.854
And what we found with each of the films,

137
00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:44.121
by virtue of necessity was how we're going to get them

138
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:46.862
out there, how we're going to get them out there quickly,

139
00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:48.344
and we're going to reach people who

140
00:05:48.344 --> 00:05:51.757
either disagree with us or don't care.

141
00:05:51.757 --> 00:05:54.179
Well, you can't move quickly by going through

142
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:57.122
traditional gate keepers, good or bad.

143
00:05:57.122 --> 00:05:58.381
<v Woman>You mean the Hollywood Film</v>

144
00:05:58.381 --> 00:05:59.629
distribution industry?

145
00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.122
<v ->I mean yeah, traditional, movie theaters,</v>

146
00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:04.109
television networks, cable companies.

147
00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:06.807
They just move at a slower pace, number one,

148
00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:10.359
and number two, if you go strictly traditional,

149
00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:12.514
it's going to be harder to reach

150
00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:14.625
the people who are disagreeing with you.

151
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:15.767
I mean, let's think about it for a minute,

152
00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:18.326
and again, I only realized this after the fact,

153
00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:20.620
but who's going to spend eight, nine or ten dollars

154
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.286
to see a documentary with a point of view

155
00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:25.291
that you radically disagree with?

156
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.518
Not going to happen.

157
00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:28.672
But it's playing at your church,

158
00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:31.467
your neighbor says come over,

159
00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:34.411
a member of your family who you can't stand politically

160
00:06:34.411 --> 00:06:36.661
says sit down and watch this,

161
00:06:36.661 --> 00:06:39.477
and that's a whole other story.

162
00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:42.421
And that's what we've discovered, again,

163
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:44.074
with each film making more in roads

164
00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:46.346
and then with the Walmart movie,

165
00:06:46.346 --> 00:06:49.087
our organizers started before I started shooting anything.

166
00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:52.319
She was there first, Lisa Smithline, was right down

167
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.780
in the corner office here

168
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.031
and she started working the groups

169
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.769
and calling and spreading the word

170
00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:00.041
and so we opened in a thousand churches

171
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:02.558
and then we had a student screening in

172
00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:04.969
every state in the nation,

173
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:06.707
environmentalists did screenings,

174
00:07:06.707 --> 00:07:08.243
women's groups did screenings,

175
00:07:08.243 --> 00:07:09.449
labour did screenings,

176
00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.262
I mean it just went on and on and on.

177
00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:14.046
Uniquely, as I say, because Walmart has offended

178
00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:15.368
so many people.

179
00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:17.245
Small businesses, you know, communities.

180
00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:21.661
But it was a great way to get the film out quickly,

181
00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:23.890
to get it to all these groups,

182
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.469
and then people buy the DVDs,

183
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.210
they go to Walmartmovie.com, our website,

184
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.791
they get it and they become an organizer.

185
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:32.114
<v Woman>It is true.</v>

186
00:07:32.114 --> 00:07:34.407
I found out about it initially on the internet.

187
00:07:34.407 --> 00:07:35.612
I had gotten an email,

188
00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:37.639
I don't remember which group it could have been,

189
00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.073
moveon.org, I don't know who it was actually now,

190
00:07:41.073 --> 00:07:43.910
but immediately became engaged in it

191
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.926
and you brought the public into the process

192
00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:48.433
of even helping select the title,

193
00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:51.195
so people felt as though they were a part of this.

194
00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:55.590
Now again, what were you trying to achieve in that?

195
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.584
<v ->Well, in terms of distribution,</v>

196
00:07:57.584 --> 00:07:59.643
I was using what was available to me,

197
00:07:59.643 --> 00:08:02.779
which is the internet, and then as I've read a lot,

198
00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:06.426
now I'm a technological idiot, so it's fascinating

199
00:08:06.426 --> 00:08:08.240
at least to me and my family,

200
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.885
that I'm using the internet so heavily,

201
00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:12.741
but in all the reading I've done,

202
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.741
what I've learned was that it's an interactive medium.

203
00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.428
In other words, it's not just a megaphone

204
00:08:19.428 --> 00:08:21.167
to speak to people.

205
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.803
And the more you interact the better you are,

206
00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.704
so out of that grew regular email letters

207
00:08:26.704 --> 00:08:29.701
that I sent people, a blog of my own,

208
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:33.232
and various ways that they could participate,

209
00:08:33.232 --> 00:08:35.173
including naming our company,

210
00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:37.146
which is Brave New Films and naming

211
00:08:37.146 --> 00:08:41.210
the title of the movie, Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price.

212
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.047
And we plan to go further with that in the future,

213
00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:45.764
on future films.

214
00:08:45.764 --> 00:08:48.132
Now we have field producers, we have 1,200 people

215
00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:51.759
around the world who signed up to volunteer.

216
00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:53.732
They shot photos for the film,

217
00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:55.652
they shot videos for the film,

218
00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:57.465
they distributed the film,

219
00:08:57.465 --> 00:08:58.926
they wrote press releases,

220
00:08:58.926 --> 00:08:59.929
it's amazing.

221
00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:01.251
<v Woman>So it really belongs to the people</v>

222
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:02.510
in a sense as well.

223
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.598
<v ->Oh, totally.</v>

224
00:09:03.598 --> 00:09:04.664
<v Woman>And this is grass roots,</v>

225
00:09:04.664 --> 00:09:07.758
which when you look at Out Foxed, for example,

226
00:09:07.758 --> 00:09:10.627
look at the way the media is being manipulated,

227
00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:11.981
and there are a few shining stars

228
00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:14.829
that are rising above that, but not too many.

229
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:18.552
This is really looking like the future way

230
00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:20.269
of distribution of information.

231
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.754
<v ->Well, it certainly is a great way to do it</v>

232
00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:25.218
and the way that I'm committed to and

233
00:09:25.218 --> 00:09:26.882
everybody finds different ways,

234
00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:29.740
but the tendency, the trend, where anybody

235
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.809
can make a video and put it up on Google now,

236
00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:36.289
I think it's really an extraordinary time that

237
00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:38.892
we will look back on in five, ten years

238
00:09:38.892 --> 00:09:41.003
and say can you remember when?

239
00:09:41.003 --> 00:09:44.321
And the old ways are going to just totally disappear

240
00:09:44.321 --> 00:09:45.782
in very quick order.

241
00:09:45.782 --> 00:09:46.944
<v Woman>It is, it's very exciting.</v>

242
00:09:46.944 --> 00:09:49.803
How do your peers feel about what you're doing

243
00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:51.957
when a lot of them are still going in the

244
00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:53.749
traditional way?

245
00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:57.429
<v ->Well, the ones who talk to me,</v>

246
00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:58.869
because there are many who don't,

247
00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:00.768
but the ones who talk to me are excited

248
00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:03.626
because they all realize the possibility.

249
00:10:03.626 --> 00:10:06.645
Content aside, whether you do political,

250
00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:08.063
whether you don't, whether you agree with me

251
00:10:08.063 --> 00:10:09.940
or disagree with me, content aside,

252
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.191
just as a distribution way,

253
00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:17.191
it's very clear with CBS making available Lost and

254
00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:19.742
Desperate Housewives for downloading

255
00:10:19.742 --> 00:10:21.737
on your iPod, you know.

256
00:10:21.737 --> 00:10:24.958
So we're in a revolution.

257
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.515
<v Woman>This interview will be available on your</v>

258
00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:28.510
video iPod and Google.

259
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.675
<v ->So that...</v>

260
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.651
There's no going backwards.

261
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:37.610
I'm fortunate and thrilled to be at the front end

262
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.074
of some of this stuff and we're continuing to explore

263
00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:43.018
how we continue to do that.

264
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.500
The meeting I just left was with Jim Gillian,

265
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.665
who's done a lot of the great work for us,

266
00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:50.164
you know, dreaming and scheming and

267
00:10:50.164 --> 00:10:52.148
thinking about what are the next steps

268
00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:53.652
that we want to keep doing.

269
00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:56.233
<v Woman>From an activism point of view,</v>

270
00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:57.950
obviously you did this so people would make

271
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.944
decisions, choices, take action.

272
00:10:59.944 --> 00:11:03.710
What have been some of the inspirational

273
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.120
stories and actions that have come out of the

274
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.253
airing of this movie?

275
00:11:08.253 --> 00:11:10.557
<v ->Well, there's a couple.</v>

276
00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:14.802
One thing is we immediately started getting

277
00:11:14.802 --> 00:11:17.170
letters from people who were fighting Walmart,

278
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.802
site fights they call them,

279
00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:20.562
where there are coalitions resisting Walmart

280
00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:22.396
moving into their community.

281
00:11:22.396 --> 00:11:23.794
People who were using it,

282
00:11:23.794 --> 00:11:25.490
people who were getting multiple copies,

283
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.996
and then one city counsel overturned

284
00:11:27.996 --> 00:11:29.105
the decision.

285
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.545
Now, it wasn't strictly because of the film,

286
00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:33.126
the important thing is the film is married

287
00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.633
to the groups who are doing the work.

288
00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:37.393
And that's the other shift,

289
00:11:37.393 --> 00:11:39.185
in other words, I love going to the movies,

290
00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:40.177
I love going to the movie theater,

291
00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:41.318
I love buying my popcorn,

292
00:11:41.318 --> 00:11:43.344
but with these films, I've made a commitment

293
00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:45.595
to connect them with the groups

294
00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:49.189
and the groups take them and make use of them

295
00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:50.587
because the groups and the people

296
00:11:50.587 --> 00:11:54.000
on the ground are going to create the social change.

297
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.578
So with that in mind, and again,

298
00:11:55.578 --> 00:11:57.498
I don't want it to seem it's all the film,

299
00:11:57.498 --> 00:11:59.759
hard working groups around the country

300
00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:02.469
are using it and it's helping tip over a city counsel vote,

301
00:12:02.469 --> 00:12:06.077
or it's helping bring a community together and say

302
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:08.167
we didn't know that, we've got to stop that

303
00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:09.543
from happening,

304
00:12:09.543 --> 00:12:12.423
or get a church involved or a student group involved.

305
00:12:12.423 --> 00:12:15.506
We're getting letters and emails about that all the time.

306
00:12:15.506 --> 00:12:17.020
It's extraordinary.

307
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.503
<v Woman>What about fall out?</v>

308
00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:22.268
Have you encountered any unpleasantness as a result

309
00:12:22.268 --> 00:12:23.313
of it?

310
00:12:23.313 --> 00:12:25.308
Walmart can't be too pleased about it.

311
00:12:25.308 --> 00:12:27.004
<v ->You know, I keep waiting for them to invite me</v>

312
00:12:27.004 --> 00:12:29.574
on the board of directors, it hasn't happened,

313
00:12:29.574 --> 00:12:31.547
and I keep waiting for them to sell the movie

314
00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:33.478
in Walmart, but it still hasn't happened.

315
00:12:33.478 --> 00:12:34.619
<v Woman>Not happening either.</v>

316
00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:36.592
<v ->No, it's surprising.</v>

317
00:12:36.592 --> 00:12:39.376
They've been attacking me pretty heavily.

318
00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:42.139
But, you know, that comes with the job

319
00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:43.952
if one is going to take this on.

320
00:12:43.952 --> 00:12:47.994
That comes with the job if one is going to take this on,

321
00:12:47.994 --> 00:12:50.266
I think it would be naive to assume you're not

322
00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:51.685
going to get attacked.

323
00:12:51.685 --> 00:12:56.143
It's never fun, but it's inevitable

324
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.319
in these cases and again, at Walmartmovie.com,

325
00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.431
we posted all the attacks they did on me

326
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:02.479
and all the attacks on the film,

327
00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.644
and it just comes with the territory.

328
00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:06.105
<v Woman>In a way, it almost strengthens</v>

329
00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:07.566
your case.

330
00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:10.724
<v ->Well, it certainly, one expects it.</v>

331
00:13:10.724 --> 00:13:12.323
<v Woman>Right, right.</v>

332
00:13:12.323 --> 00:13:14.435
You got a lot of media coverage too when you

333
00:13:14.435 --> 00:13:16.824
first came out with this as I understand.

334
00:13:16.824 --> 00:13:18.542
Where you not on the morning show circuit,

335
00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.174
network level?

336
00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:21.678
Can you tell a little bit about some of

337
00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:23.171
the media attention you got and how it

338
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:25.539
was treated in the media?

339
00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:28.482
Was it fair and balanced, the treatment of it?

340
00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:31.544
<v ->Well, other than the New York Post calling me</v>

341
00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:35.287
a Nazi film maker, I think it was,

342
00:13:35.287 --> 00:13:38.914
and Bill O'Rielly doing his usual insults,

343
00:13:38.914 --> 00:13:41.602
for the most part it was pretty good actually.

344
00:13:41.602 --> 00:13:46.602
There was a lot of press attention all over the world.

345
00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:48.961
I just came back from ten days in London.

346
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.358
<v Woman>Yeah, you look very fresh.</v>

347
00:13:50.358 --> 00:13:52.054
I know you're still jet lagged.

348
00:13:52.054 --> 00:13:53.654
<v ->Yeah, Ireland and Scotland</v>

349
00:13:53.654 --> 00:13:56.481
and it continues because it is a story

350
00:13:56.481 --> 00:13:59.926
that affects people's lives and it is a story

351
00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:03.936
that there are no easy, natural, political breaks on.

352
00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:07.147
Now, having said that, there are certainly places

353
00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:09.323
that Walmart advertises heavily that

354
00:14:09.323 --> 00:14:12.951
we would've like to have had more receptivity to us,

355
00:14:12.951 --> 00:14:14.998
but again, I think that's expected.

356
00:14:14.998 --> 00:14:17.622
But we have probably 300, because the press agents,

357
00:14:17.622 --> 00:14:20.267
there was like 300 pages of articles

358
00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:23.617
and just a ton of TV and radio.

359
00:14:23.617 --> 00:14:26.464
So it's been positive because that's part of the job

360
00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:28.352
with these films, right?

361
00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:30.112
Which is to help tell a story that isn't

362
00:14:30.112 --> 00:14:32.363
being told and then to the degree

363
00:14:32.363 --> 00:14:34.432
that the media finds it interesting,

364
00:14:34.432 --> 00:14:37.408
then it becomes told to even more people.

365
00:14:37.408 --> 00:14:38.592
<v Woman>Do you have any idea</v>

366
00:14:38.592 --> 00:14:40.309
how what the reach has been so far?

367
00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:42.165
I know it's hard because it's in living rooms

368
00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:43.669
and churches and in our case,

369
00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:46.346
we played it in the town library for everybody.

370
00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:48.831
<v ->I mean, Walmart Week, where we had over</v>

371
00:14:48.831 --> 00:14:51.892
8,000 screenings, conservatively we estimated

372
00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:54.187
700,000 people saw it just in that week.

373
00:14:54.187 --> 00:14:57.600
So we've got to be in the millions by now.

374
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.742
<v Woman>Fabulous.</v>

375
00:14:58.742 --> 00:15:01.429
Now you have this other project in conjunction

376
00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:03.360
with the ACLU.

377
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.927
Now that is going to be airing over the course of...

378
00:15:07.754 --> 00:15:09.301
<v ->One year, it's one a month,</v>

379
00:15:09.301 --> 00:15:12.021
it's on Link TV and it's on Court TV.

380
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:13.535
<v Woman>And it's also available online</v>

381
00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:14.602
and on DVD?

382
00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:15.594
<v ->Yep.</v>

383
00:15:15.594 --> 00:15:17.919
<v Woman>And this is Freedom Files.</v>

384
00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:18.804
<v ->Yes.</v>

385
00:15:18.804 --> 00:15:20.500
<v Woman>And I took a look at some of the topics</v>

386
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.751
and I've seen just a few clips off the site,

387
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:25.908
but the number one is to Beyond the Patriot Act.

388
00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:27.529
Can you just,

389
00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:29.812
I know you don't have time to discuss all ten parts,

390
00:15:29.812 --> 00:15:32.435
but can you do a little flipping through

391
00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:34.633
what we can expect to see in this

392
00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:36.425
and really what some of the profound

393
00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:39.262
moments for you were in this project?

394
00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:40.510
<v ->Well, first of all, let me just say that</v>

395
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.272
Jeremy Keagan who directed and produced them

396
00:15:43.272 --> 00:15:45.245
really did the lion's share and his team,

397
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.080
of the heavy lifting.

398
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.746
Anthony Romero who's the head of the ACLU

399
00:15:49.746 --> 00:15:52.722
is a visionary who I'm proud to call a friend,

400
00:15:52.722 --> 00:15:55.762
and we've been talking for a while about using

401
00:15:55.762 --> 00:15:58.226
the media to tell their story more.

402
00:15:58.226 --> 00:16:00.380
It's certainly one thing to reach the lawyers

403
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.218
and that group but civil liberty stories

404
00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:06.492
are very personal stories that affect all of us.

405
00:16:06.492 --> 00:16:11.492
So we found a whole series of these half hour shows

406
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:14.577
which go into how you are affected by the

407
00:16:14.577 --> 00:16:18.427
Patriot act or racial profiling

408
00:16:18.427 --> 00:16:20.955
and how it affects people around the country,

409
00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:23.515
or gay rights, or women's rights,

410
00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:26.320
or student issues or how a case gets to the

411
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.040
Supreme Court, but always doing it with the point

412
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.912
of view of human personal interactions.

413
00:16:32.912 --> 00:16:34.448
And from that point of view, frankly, I think again

414
00:16:34.448 --> 00:16:37.765
whatever your politics, it makes very gripping

415
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:41.178
and involving television.

416
00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:42.575
<v Woman>Just the little bits I've seen,</v>

417
00:16:42.575 --> 00:16:44.506
I watched a little bit on the racial profiling,

418
00:16:44.506 --> 00:16:47.268
for example, another one which is kind of

419
00:16:47.268 --> 00:16:50.980
interesting, I wouldn't say it's a double edged sword,

420
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.529
but it's religious freedom.

421
00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:55.481
Now people think of the ACLU,

422
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.382
ok, you can't do your, you know, god bless America,

423
00:16:58.382 --> 00:17:00.057
etc., anymore in school.

424
00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:02.755
Yet at the some time, they're also there to protect

425
00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:05.998
the religious expression of any and every group.

426
00:17:05.998 --> 00:17:08.142
Can you talk about just that issue a little bit

427
00:17:08.142 --> 00:17:09.880
so people get an idea more about what the ACLU

428
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.013
is trying to get across?

429
00:17:12.013 --> 00:17:13.752
<v ->Well, the ACLU, like many groups</v>

430
00:17:13.752 --> 00:17:16.962
in our culture, gets boiled down to a sentence

431
00:17:16.962 --> 00:17:19.959
or a phrase and they are much more than that,

432
00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:23.373
and in the religious freedom show it shows a young man

433
00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:26.711
who I think is a very religious catholic who was

434
00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:29.570
going for some counseling and they were insisting that

435
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.633
he go to a baptist counselor of some kind in his school.

436
00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:36.460
So the ACLU was in the position of defending

437
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.460
his right as a strong believer in Catholic religion

438
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:46.795
not to have to be forced to go in with a baptist counselor.

439
00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:49.302
And I found that just fascinating because

440
00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:52.341
it's what you were saying, here they are defending

441
00:17:52.341 --> 00:17:55.413
the rights of the people to have their religious choice,

442
00:17:55.413 --> 00:17:57.824
not putting them in the narrow box that they're

443
00:17:57.824 --> 00:18:00.149
against them, which they're not.

444
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:02.634
<v Woman>What about racial profiling?</v>

445
00:18:02.634 --> 00:18:04.415
Can you talk a little bit about that

446
00:18:04.415 --> 00:18:07.370
because that's now really turning out to be

447
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.343
one of the most incendiary issues

448
00:18:09.343 --> 00:18:11.967
and it could even be something that

449
00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:13.983
we could say is responsible for some of the

450
00:18:13.983 --> 00:18:16.767
shootings of policemen and such in California

451
00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:18.910
that's going on these days.

452
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.182
What did you find there?

453
00:18:21.182 --> 00:18:22.718
<v ->What we found in racial profiling,</v>

454
00:18:22.718 --> 00:18:24.915
first and most important, whether it was African American

455
00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:27.198
or Muslim, it doesn't work.

456
00:18:27.198 --> 00:18:30.494
In other words, what they're doing is they're arresting

457
00:18:30.494 --> 00:18:33.928
lots of innocent people by creating a simplistic profile

458
00:18:33.928 --> 00:18:37.533
and saying if you are a Muslim you are

459
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.709
under suspicion or if you are an African American

460
00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:41.842
driving his car along here, you are under suspicion.

461
00:18:41.842 --> 00:18:44.263
Now what happens when you arrest innocent people,

462
00:18:44.263 --> 00:18:48.135
or target innocent people is not just that you're

463
00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:51.228
going against what many Americans believe in,

464
00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:53.383
but the bad guys are getting away.

465
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.898
I mean think about that for a minute.

466
00:18:54.898 --> 00:18:57.916
Every time you throw a wide net and whoever

467
00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:00.348
falls into you grab, which is basically

468
00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.214
what racial profiling is,

469
00:19:02.214 --> 00:19:05.062
it's the simple man's ineffective way

470
00:19:05.062 --> 00:19:07.547
of going after bad guys versus,

471
00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:10.193
wait a minute, we've got information on this person

472
00:19:10.193 --> 00:19:13.638
or that person, we've done research, we have police work.

473
00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:15.323
For every time you throw the wide net and

474
00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:17.211
you just grab who falls through,

475
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:19.483
the people who are really committing the crimes

476
00:19:19.483 --> 00:19:22.149
are over here getting away and that's a disaster.

477
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:25.658
So we try to make that clear in the episode

478
00:19:25.658 --> 00:19:28.815
as well as bringing home to people

479
00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:31.653
that these Muslims or these African Americans,

480
00:19:31.653 --> 00:19:33.370
they are us.

481
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.431
They are people, hard-working, and caring,

482
00:19:36.431 --> 00:19:38.617
and committed Americans.

483
00:19:38.617 --> 00:19:39.524
They are us.

484
00:19:39.524 --> 00:19:41.028
And that's not what our country should be about.

485
00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:43.630
<v Woman>And plus it's creating very deep resentments</v>

486
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.929
among families and cultures, neighborhoods, communities

487
00:19:47.929 --> 00:19:52.929
and I think we're starting to see some of the repercussions

488
00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:56.099
of that on a large scale even.

489
00:19:56.099 --> 00:19:59.491
What about free speech?

490
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.600
This is a big one.

491
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.000
I was noticing in one of them just kind of going

492
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.898
through it briefly.

493
00:20:04.898 --> 00:20:07.426
Maybe you can explain what that segment was about

494
00:20:07.426 --> 00:20:10.722
that had allocated free speech zones.

495
00:20:10.722 --> 00:20:13.634
What's up with free speech zones?

496
00:20:13.634 --> 00:20:16.418
We're suppose to have free speech everywhere.

497
00:20:16.418 --> 00:20:18.092
<v ->Where you step out of the zone and you can't</v>

498
00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.202
have free speech.

499
00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:22.199
It was focused on the conventions where they

500
00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:24.684
decided that they were going to put people in pens,

501
00:20:24.684 --> 00:20:29.684
literally, and that's where they could exercise free speech.

502
00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:31.947
Can you imagine if we read about this going on

503
00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:32.811
in another country?

504
00:20:32.811 --> 00:20:34.390
How outraged we would be here?

505
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.713
How dare they do that?

506
00:20:35.713 --> 00:20:37.568
Well, it was happening here at the republican and

507
00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:40.032
the democratic conventions, both and

508
00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:43.275
the ACLU, to their credit, was resisting that,

509
00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:46.133
saying no, that's not what we should be about.

510
00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:48.576
Free speech is one of the really critically

511
00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:51.104
important rights that we have in this country

512
00:20:51.104 --> 00:20:52.821
and we need to protect that.

513
00:20:52.821 --> 00:20:55.797
<v Woman>So, what did you learn around</v>

514
00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.141
the subject of free speech,

515
00:20:57.141 --> 00:21:00.116
other than that one situation?

516
00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:02.410
<v ->I learned in different cases...</v>

517
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.593
<v Woman>In terms of abuses</v>

518
00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:04.991
and what's really going on,

519
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:06.804
what rights have been stripped away

520
00:21:06.804 --> 00:21:09.374
as a result of the Patriot act and so forth?

521
00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:11.860
<v ->Well, I think, I mean, there's the Patriot act</v>

522
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.374
which was it's own show, as you went into,

523
00:21:13.374 --> 00:21:15.070
and then there was the free speech,

524
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.950
so I think in addition to the political conventions,

525
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.550
the thing that was most shocking to me

526
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.448
was this young man on the internet

527
00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.539
who had created this encyclopedia.

528
00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:26.835
And they were essentially, because he had some words

529
00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:29.672
that could have been misinterpreted,

530
00:21:29.672 --> 00:21:34.546
were starting to impinge on his right to exercise

531
00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:38.258
free speech and again what we're trying to do

532
00:21:38.258 --> 00:21:41.191
is say these are basic to who we are

533
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:44.316
as a people, who we are as a country,

534
00:21:44.316 --> 00:21:47.548
and all of us need to protect them.

535
00:21:47.548 --> 00:21:49.479
Because there is a tendency to think,

536
00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:51.612
well that doesn't really affect me

537
00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:54.705
and I'm not out there protesting at that convention

538
00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:57.745
or I'm not out there doing this stuff on the internet,

539
00:21:57.745 --> 00:21:59.505
but you know, then it becomes

540
00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:02.128
what kind of country do we want?

541
00:22:02.128 --> 00:22:03.686
And what are we going to do about it?

542
00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:04.688
<v Woman>Right.</v>

543
00:22:04.688 --> 00:22:07.562
So what are you looking at...

544
00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:10.277
Obviously, you've gotten yourself right in the middle

545
00:22:10.277 --> 00:22:12.954
of the most heated issues of the time.

546
00:22:12.954 --> 00:22:15.856
What are you looking at down the road?

547
00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:18.959
Any upcoming projects that we should be looking for?

548
00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:20.101
<v ->Well, look for them.</v>

549
00:22:20.101 --> 00:22:22.607
But the one thing that I've learned with the Walmart movie

550
00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:25.647
and the Fox movie is there's a great value in keeping

551
00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:27.716
them secret until the last minute.

552
00:22:27.716 --> 00:22:32.716
But we'll be announcing our first film that we didn't make

553
00:22:33.316 --> 00:22:37.006
that's some outside film makers made in early March

554
00:22:37.006 --> 00:22:39.075
and you can look for that.

555
00:22:39.075 --> 00:22:41.763
And then if we can raise the funding,

556
00:22:41.763 --> 00:22:44.089
there'll be another film that I will do

557
00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:45.550
by the fall.

558
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.875
We're trying to fundraise around that

559
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:52.003
that will arouse people's passions.

560
00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:54.413
<v Woman>Ok, so they are somewhat political</v>

561
00:22:54.413 --> 00:22:55.885
or social in nature?

562
00:22:55.885 --> 00:22:57.570
<v ->Yes, yes they are.</v>

563
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:58.200
Definitely.

564
00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:58.968
Very.

565
00:22:58.968 --> 00:23:00.013
<v Woman>Well, you have me sitting on the edge</v>

566
00:23:00.013 --> 00:23:01.751
of my chair, I can't wait to hear what's next.

567
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:02.775
<v ->Good.</v>

568
00:23:02.775 --> 00:23:03.959
<v Woman>I know you're very busy</v>

569
00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:05.335
and you're jet lagged and thank you so much

570
00:23:05.335 --> 00:23:06.487
for taking the time to spend with us.

571
00:23:06.487 --> 00:23:09.158
<v ->It's my pleasure, sorry I couldn't spend more.</v>

572
00:23:10.882 --> 00:23:12.460
<v ->If every there was a time to begin paying attention</v>

573
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.575
to what Hollywood has to say, it may be now.

574
00:23:15.575 --> 00:23:17.494
Meanwhile, just go to his website

575
00:23:17.494 --> 00:23:19.798
and pick up a copy of the film to share with your

576
00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.260
friends or family.

577
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.440
Until next time, thanks for watching.
