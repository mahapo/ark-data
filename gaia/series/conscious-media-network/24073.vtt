00:00:01.049 --> 00:00:03.900
<v ->Martin Gray has seen more magical places on earth</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.986
than perhaps any other human being.

3
00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:07.172
The wonderful part is that,

4
00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:10.074
as a passionate scholar, researcher and traveler,

5
00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:12.136
he has made it his life's work to

6
00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.506
bring these places to you via his phenomenal website;

7
00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:17.664
SacredSites.com.

8
00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.748
And, while his work can bring a bit of the magic to you

9
00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:20.885
via your laptop,

10
00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:23.450
his real joy is to inspire others to

11
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.355
make their own pilgrimages to

12
00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:27.912
these sacred and holy sites around the globe;

13
00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.926
including some of the more commonly known destinations;

14
00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.472
such as the Great Pyramid.

15
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.465
Martin, you're known for your studies of ancient sites.

16
00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:44.947
But, the truth is the only reason

17
00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:46.938
you've been able to study in such depth is because

18
00:00:46.938 --> 00:00:49.214
you have gone into so many disciplines

19
00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:50.746
that it's mind-boggling.

20
00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.441
Archaeology, Astrophysics, Astronomy,

21
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:56.175
Paleontology, all of it.

22
00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:57.950
You've kind of gone Anthropology.

23
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.916
You've gone there so you know your stuff.

24
00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.622
So, I'm just telling people that in advance;

25
00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:04.553
to listen up here.

26
00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:06.931
And, the thing I don't know about you yet,

27
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.152
even though I do know you,

28
00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:10.602
is I don't know how this all began.

29
00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.471
<v ->Well, one thing I'd like to give a little clarification;</v>

30
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:16.301
yes, I have a sort of secondary specialty in ancient sites.

31
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:19.406
But, really what my specialty is sacred sites,

32
00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.205
pilgrimage shrines, holy places;

33
00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:23.273
a lot of which were very ancient or

34
00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:25.079
were known and used in ancient times.

35
00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.747
And, thereby, I've been to them.

36
00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:28.355
And, kind of how I got into this

37
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.275
is my father was a diplomat.

38
00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:31.943
And, he traveled around the world.

39
00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:34.257
And, his hobbies were archaeology and photography.

40
00:01:34.257 --> 00:01:36.686
And, my mother was sort of a pseudo art historian.

41
00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:38.027
So, I was brought up in art museums,

42
00:01:38.027 --> 00:01:40.230
looking at great art; paintings.

43
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.599
And being influenced by the composition of the paintings.

44
00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.857
And, my father's going off to archaeology sites,

45
00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:47.200
taking pictures with cameras.

46
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.767
And, I'm a little three, four, five, six,

47
00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.264
eight, nine, twelve year old kid.

48
00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:52.308
I lived in India from 12 to 16.

49
00:01:52.308 --> 00:01:54.673
And so, I'm going to these sacred places.

50
00:01:54.673 --> 00:01:57.113
A lot of times, the greatest architecture of antiquity

51
00:01:57.113 --> 00:01:58.705
are ceremonial places;

52
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:01.250
not the living structures of the people,

53
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.181
not even the living structures of the nobility;

54
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:04.776
the aristocracy, but

55
00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:07.020
the actual religious structures of the people.

56
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.851
And so, we're going.

57
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:09.079
My father's photographing them.

58
00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.527
My mother's commenting on them in an artistic sense.

59
00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.361
And, I fell in love with archaeology when

60
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:15.260
I was, I think, seven years old.

61
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.662
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

62
00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:17.923
Well, that's a good place to begin.

63
00:02:17.923 --> 00:02:19.936
What a privileged childhood you had in that sense,

64
00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:21.233
just amazing.

65
00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:25.091
So, you've had also some mystical visions?

66
00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:27.800
You've had experiences that have

67
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.179
taken you deeper into the subject too.

68
00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.717
Is that something you'd like to comment on

69
00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:34.821
at this point before we go along this path?

70
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.577
<v ->Yes.</v>

71
00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:40.203
It began when I was six and a half, seven years old.

72
00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:42.794
And, I'd known that it was happening.

73
00:02:42.794 --> 00:02:43.888
But, I didn't know what it was.

74
00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:45.995
And, I didn't have anybody that I could talk about it.

75
00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:47.495
So, I didn't really have a sort of

76
00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:49.425
intellectual understanding of it.

77
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:50.764
But, one day I'm at a party;

78
00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:52.698
or my parents have had a cocktail party at the house.

79
00:02:52.698 --> 00:02:54.791
There were some other military attaches and

80
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.366
pilots and diplomats there.

81
00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.377
And, my parents bring my sister and I out to

82
00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:02.923
parade us before they put us to bed.

83
00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.217
And then, one of these colonels or something

84
00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.504
asked me, thinking I'm going to say

85
00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:08.486
I want to be an air force pilot like my father,

86
00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.453
he says "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

87
00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:12.486
And, I said I wanted to be a philosopher.

88
00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:13.711
And, all these people stopped.

89
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:14.713
And, they thought "What's a six year old kid

90
00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:16.620
"or seven year old kid saying that?"

91
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.782
And, it was the closest word I had.

92
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.226
Seven year olds don't have that many

93
00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:22.764
words in their language, their available vocabulary.

94
00:03:22.764 --> 00:03:24.336
It was the closest word I had

95
00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:26.925
that sort of approximated these visions

96
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:29.874
of myself that I had seen when I got to be older;

97
00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:31.901
that when I got to be older, I was saying something,

98
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.509
doing something that, at that point in my life,

99
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.568
I thought "Well, maybe it's a philosopher."

100
00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:38.750
Now, I know it's that and more.

101
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.951
But, it was at that time.

102
00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:41.636
And then, there were a number of different

103
00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:42.481
phases in my life.

104
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:43.945
When I was 12, 13 in India,

105
00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.020
very, very strong experiences of these.

106
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.783
Then, when I was 19 and 20

107
00:03:47.783 --> 00:03:49.561
and I was living in a Hindu monastery,

108
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:51.448
very strong experiences.

109
00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.462
And then, when I was about 28, 29,

110
00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.663
I began having these experiences again;

111
00:03:55.663 --> 00:03:57.299
these visionary experiences.

112
00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.031
These are not intuitions.

113
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:00.533
These are not intuitions.

114
00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:01.466
People say "Oh, I had an intuition.

115
00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:03.401
"Go over to Wisconsin and see my grandmother."

116
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.574
I'm not talking about that.

117
00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:07.407
I'm seeing full fledged color cinematographic

118
00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.404
experiences in my head.

119
00:04:09.404 --> 00:04:11.183
And, I after I got good at receiving them--

120
00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:12.976
<v Voiceover>Would you say maybe "remembrances"</v>

121
00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:14.272
might be a good word?

122
00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:17.254
<v ->Remembrances, but lots of it future;</v>

123
00:04:17.254 --> 00:04:18.720
lot's of it future positioned,

124
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.746
indicating something that I could,

125
00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:23.025
never should, but could do in the future.

126
00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:25.492
And, one of the ones, when I was about 28, 29,

127
00:04:25.492 --> 00:04:27.927
this information began communicating.

128
00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:29.659
Follow the pilgrimage routes of

129
00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.002
the ancient religions.

130
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:34.070
I owned a couple of travel agencies at that point.

131
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.472
I had a good bit of money.

132
00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:37.172
I was a hardcore bike racer.

133
00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:38.674
And I thought "Well, I'm just gonna get a mountain bike

134
00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:40.137
"and ride around the world

135
00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:41.405
"and visit sacred sites--"
<v Voiceover>Sure, why not?</v>

136
00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:42.509
<v ->"And take pictures."</v>

137
00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.146
So now, 22 years later,

138
00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:46.682
123 countries--

139
00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.165
<v Voiceover>123?</v>

140
00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:50.121
<v ->123 countries, added it up the other day,</v>

141
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:51.555
about 40 by bicycle.

142
00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Voiceover>And we're not talking about</v>

143
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.020
just like passing through Luxembourg?

144
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.521
<v ->No, no.</v>

145
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:55.643
It's extremely extensive.

146
00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:57.282
I have all these points on a map.

147
00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:58.695
And, people say "Well, how do you do it?"

148
00:04:58.695 --> 00:04:59.761
And, I go "I come in at the north,

149
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:00.965
"south, east or west and generally

150
00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:02.526
"go to the other direction."

151
00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.489
I never make reservations.

152
00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:06.268
I never, ever, ever make reservations

153
00:05:06.268 --> 00:05:07.862
except for the plane over.

154
00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:09.637
Never make reservations for hotels.

155
00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:11.477
Just dive in.

156
00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.537
And, a lot of the places that I go,

157
00:05:12.537 --> 00:05:13.972
there ain't no fancy hotels.

158
00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:16.580
And, I don't want to stay with rich Americans and Europeans.

159
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.782
I want to be with the locals.

160
00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:19.183
I want to be with the people;

161
00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:20.977
the pilgrims at ground level.

162
00:05:20.977 --> 00:05:22.681
And, this is why I say even though I don't have

163
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:24.488
one of those, to me, rather silly

164
00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:28.740
degrees from a University saying he's a PhD in Anthropology.

165
00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:30.291
Because, what anthropology is really about

166
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:32.822
is field research.

167
00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:34.299
So, in the Sacred Site studies,

168
00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:35.659
I've got as much field research as,

169
00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.032
the top guys in the world say

170
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.528
as any living human being.

171
00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:40.166
You know, it's a 1,200 sacred sites--

172
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:40.636
<v Voiceover>Yeah, you've done the work.</v>

173
00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:42.073
You've been there, you've put your life there.

174
00:05:42.073 --> 00:05:43.305
<v ->As a pilgrim.</v>

175
00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:44.739
With the pilgrims.

176
00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:45.835
Sleeping on the ground with them,

177
00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:46.877
on the cots with them,

178
00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:49.047
just doing everything with the local pilgrims.

179
00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Voiceover>In fact, speaking of that,</v>

180
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.043
I'm going to jot down a little note here.

181
00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:54.274
Because, I want to talk about this year in Mecca.

182
00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:55.254
Because, you were there.

183
00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.583
And, with everything going on,

184
00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.018
we're gonna get around to that.

185
00:05:58.018 --> 00:05:59.020
That's a little more current.

186
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.493
But, I wanted to ask you;

187
00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:04.584
now start going into another area.

188
00:06:04.584 --> 00:06:06.196
And, that is

189
00:06:06.196 --> 00:06:09.826
some of the dynamics or energetics that

190
00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:12.058
actually makes these places sacred,

191
00:06:12.058 --> 00:06:15.303
which I don't know how many of our viewers

192
00:06:15.303 --> 00:06:18.072
do understand that, just like our bodies

193
00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:20.434
have meridians; energetic meridians,

194
00:06:20.434 --> 00:06:21.713
so does the planet.

195
00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:23.946
Can you talk about the notion of ley lines

196
00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:25.618
and magnetism and energetics

197
00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.295
and what happens in these places?

198
00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:29.515
<v ->Ok, yes I can.</v>

199
00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:30.043
Very well.

200
00:06:30.043 --> 00:06:30.885
So, what I'd say is

201
00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:34.647
let us call that the phenomenology of the miraculous.

202
00:06:34.647 --> 00:06:37.720
What is it that causes these particular places on the planet

203
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.016
to have a range of effects

204
00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:42.290
on a variety of different types of people?

205
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.223
And, first of all, there's this separation;

206
00:06:44.223 --> 00:06:46.067
so important between Yin and Yang;

207
00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.359
masculine and feminine,

208
00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:48.436
both in the people that are going

209
00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.234
and in the quality of the site.

210
00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:51.901
Not all sites are Yin or Yang.

211
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:54.396
Certainly not all sites are dedicated to the gods.

212
00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:56.446
The reason the were dedicated to the gods in antiquity

213
00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:57.874
is they were Yang points;

214
00:06:57.874 --> 00:07:00.915
not because patriarchal cultures took over the Yin sites.

215
00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:04.211
But they are a collection of types of

216
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:06.577
power places on the planet.

217
00:07:06.577 --> 00:07:08.092
They only became sacred sites later

218
00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:10.559
when they get invested in sanctity by tradition.

219
00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:12.352
But initially, they're just these places

220
00:07:12.352 --> 00:07:16.188
with a variety of different fields, qualities,

221
00:07:16.188 --> 00:07:19.862
luminosities, characteristics, we can't even really say

222
00:07:19.862 --> 00:07:22.731
it's not one thing, exactly what it is,

223
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.106
but in my extensive travels around the world

224
00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:27.739
and super comprehensive research on this subject,

225
00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:31.502
I've actually delineated 32 different categories

226
00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:33.346
of power places or sacred sites.

227
00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.220
32 different types,

228
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.136
being like a sacred mountain,

229
00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:39.912
a holy well, a place with a Marian apparition,

230
00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:41.785
a place with a saint lived,

231
00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:43.983
a place, there's a lot of different types of these,

232
00:07:43.983 --> 00:07:46.296
okay, but then I began thinking, okay,

233
00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:50.162
what is the cause of the power, of the quality,

234
00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:51.502
of the luminosity, of that,

235
00:07:51.502 --> 00:07:53.563
whatever it is that human beings experience.

236
00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:54.968
What is the cause of that?

237
00:07:54.968 --> 00:07:56.228
And after, again, a lot of study

238
00:07:56.228 --> 00:07:57.475
and a lot of personal experience,

239
00:07:57.475 --> 00:08:00.242
I've actually delineated 20 distinct factors

240
00:08:00.242 --> 00:08:02.842
that contribute to the power of place.

241
00:08:02.842 --> 00:08:05.714
And I've put them in three different categories.

242
00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:08.083
One, it's the power of the Earth itself.

243
00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:09.819
<v Voiceover>And what determines the power of the Earth</v>

244
00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:11.016
itself in that spot?
<v ->That I'll talk to you about.</v>

245
00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:12.779
The first three, the power of the Earth,

246
00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:15.292
then the power of the structures

247
00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:17.620
that are built at them with the sacred geometry

248
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.424
according to the sacred geography.

249
00:08:19.424 --> 00:08:22.825
According to different astral or celestial alignments.

250
00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:24.857
And then third is the power of human attention,

251
00:08:24.857 --> 00:08:26.700
which is really a wonderful thing.

252
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.400
So the first one is the power of the Earth.

253
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.034
Well, there are a number of different places

254
00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:31.359
upon this planet that have

255
00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:34.572
different electromagnetic frequencies.

256
00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:36.042
Different gravitational frequencies,

257
00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.178
and it's a big study

258
00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:38.846
and I could really go into detail on that,

259
00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:39.709
but I won't right here.

260
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:40.718
<v Voiceover>Only because we don't have</v>

261
00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:42.418
the next eight hours here today,

262
00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:44.162
but we could--
<v ->They're all monitorable,</v>

263
00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:45.183
they're all measurable,

264
00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:46.947
now people in antiquity didn't have the types

265
00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:48.590
of instruments as far as we knew,

266
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.459
that measured them, had a little scope

267
00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:51.456
with a needle saying,

268
00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.896
oh it's 32-7 or 48 whatever,

269
00:08:53.896 --> 00:08:55.298
but they felt something.

270
00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:56.561
<v Voiceover>And the shamans of the tribes</v>

271
00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:58.091
and the leaders, the elders,

272
00:08:58.091 --> 00:08:59.293
the visionars and--

273
00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:00.966
<v ->Yeah, they felt something.</v>

274
00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:03.941
And those somethings are,

275
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:06.109
we can record nowadays with modern instruments.

276
00:09:06.109 --> 00:09:07.776
But there's something there.

277
00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:09.480
It's too simplistic to say,

278
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.913
"Oh, well, they're just all on ley lines."

279
00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:13.274
And the word ley line is actually a Roman word

280
00:09:13.274 --> 00:09:15.020
that means commercial track line,

281
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.920
and Alfred Watkins, in 1921,

282
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.282
who came out with this book,

283
00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:19.922
The Old Straight Track,

284
00:09:19.922 --> 00:09:21.422
he had this idea.

285
00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:22.387
He was an antiquarian,

286
00:09:22.387 --> 00:09:23.322
not an archaeologist,

287
00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:25.395
and he traveled around England in his spare time,

288
00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:28.664
photographing pre-reformation pilgrimage cathedrals

289
00:09:28.664 --> 00:09:31.035
and neolithic sites and marking them on maps.

290
00:09:31.035 --> 00:09:32.065
One day he looked at them,

291
00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:33.858
and he went, "Gosh, you could draw straight lines

292
00:09:33.858 --> 00:09:35.138
"between these."

293
00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:36.774
And now we know that there actually are

294
00:09:36.774 --> 00:09:40.289
physical remains between the different neolithic sites.

295
00:09:40.403 --> 00:09:42.769
Interesting thing is the lines predate

296
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:44.611
the neolithic sites on them.

297
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:46.147
The lines predate it.

298
00:09:46.147 --> 00:09:47.278
This is very interesting.

299
00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:50.523
And the lines are representations of something that,

300
00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:51.787
and we find them all over the world.

301
00:09:51.787 --> 00:09:52.888
No connections between them,

302
00:09:52.888 --> 00:09:54.189
no connections between them,

303
00:09:54.189 --> 00:09:55.422
and it's sent all over the world.

304
00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:57.091
The stuff that's happening in Asia,

305
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.419
is not connected with the stuff in Europe

306
00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:01.226
in a sense of a traceable line,

307
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.189
but it's mathematics is.

308
00:10:03.189 --> 00:10:05.656
So there are various grid systems on this planet.

309
00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:06.624
Grid systems.

310
00:10:06.624 --> 00:10:09.156
And that gets more complex.

311
00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:12.238
The grid systems are composed of sub grids,

312
00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:13.767
and some of those sub grids,

313
00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:16.138
Alfred Watkins even stopped calling them ley lines,

314
00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:17.978
he said, just old straight tracks,

315
00:10:17.978 --> 00:10:18.837
that's at the end of the light--

316
00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:19.477
<v Voiceover>Old straight tracks.</v>

317
00:10:19.477 --> 00:10:20.652
<v ->He only called them old straight tracks.</v>

318
00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:23.252
So the notion of ley lines is actually a misnomer.

319
00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:24.721
<v Voiceover>Let me ask you a question in this.</v>

320
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:28.277
When you're talking about the grids,

321
00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:32.028
can it be as simplified as within a particular area,

322
00:10:32.028 --> 00:10:35.865
almost laid out like longitude and latitude.

323
00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:37.567
Is it that simple?

324
00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:38.963
<v ->No, it's much more complex.</v>

325
00:10:38.963 --> 00:10:39.766
<v Voiceover>But I mean in terms,</v>

326
00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:41.561
but more local to the area,

327
00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:43.837
or is it something that continues globally?

328
00:10:43.837 --> 00:10:44.867
<v ->It's globally and</v>

329
00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.606
the way I had some visionary experiences one time

330
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.813
in a monastery called Hilandari

331
00:10:49.813 --> 00:10:52.544
in Mount Othos in Northeastern Greece

332
00:10:52.544 --> 00:10:54.475
in 1983.

333
00:10:54.475 --> 00:10:55.784
And I've been in this church

334
00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:58.374
chanting with these Greek orthodox monks,

335
00:10:58.374 --> 00:11:00.309
and then I came out and it was like two AM

336
00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:01.712
in the morning and I'm out in this old

337
00:11:01.712 --> 00:11:03.358
11th century courtyard,

338
00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:05.116
and I sit to meditate and I see

339
00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:08.000
this picture, there was a sphere

340
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.168
that represented the Earth and inside it

341
00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:14.117
was a sort of mixture of all the platonic solids.

342
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.868
And where the vertex points of the platonic solids,

343
00:11:16.868 --> 00:11:21.107
hit the inside of the sphere of the surface of it,

344
00:11:21.107 --> 00:11:22.478
the surface of the sphere,

345
00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:23.848
determined where there were different points

346
00:11:23.848 --> 00:11:25.177
of a certain type

347
00:11:25.177 --> 00:11:26.142
on the planet.

348
00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:27.674
Then there were long, rhythmic spirals

349
00:11:27.674 --> 00:11:28.908
coming out of them going clockwise

350
00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:30.151
or counter-clockwise,

351
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:32.154
and where those long rhythmic spiral lines

352
00:11:32.154 --> 00:11:34.082
intersected with the straight lines coming

353
00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:36.486
from this grid structure inside this,

354
00:11:36.486 --> 00:11:37.953
determined even more points.

355
00:11:37.953 --> 00:11:40.322
The different structures inside were sub grids

356
00:11:40.322 --> 00:11:41.696
of the major grid,

357
00:11:41.696 --> 00:11:43.027
and the different sub grids

358
00:11:43.027 --> 00:11:45.399
had a particular energetic quality.

359
00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:48.328
Which gave rise to, if you have a sacred site in Argentina,

360
00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:49.737
and one in Afghanistan,

361
00:11:49.737 --> 00:11:51.070
no cultural connection,

362
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.672
no chronological connection,

363
00:11:52.672 --> 00:11:54.911
same founding legend, how is that?

364
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:56.502
Human beings had an experience

365
00:11:56.502 --> 00:11:58.546
the same elemental energies of the Earth,

366
00:11:58.546 --> 00:12:00.371
and they're on the same sort of grid,

367
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.103
same sort of lines,

368
00:12:01.103 --> 00:12:02.382
same sort of something.

369
00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:05.487
That's what gave rise to a similarity of founding legend.

370
00:12:05.487 --> 00:12:08.665
All these places together constituted,

371
00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:11.189
whoa, 100's of sites on the planet.

372
00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.226
But then there's others too.

373
00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:13.686
There's other types, too.

374
00:12:13.686 --> 00:12:16.232
There's that, I think there's a mathematical certainty

375
00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:17.061
to some of them,

376
00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:17.866
and Graham Hancock,

377
00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:19.237
who I know you've interviewed here before,

378
00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:21.531
his book Heaven's Mirror is very, very good.

379
00:12:21.531 --> 00:12:22.362
<v Voiceover>It's fabulous.</v>

380
00:12:22.362 --> 00:12:23.538
<v ->Very, very good about this.</v>

381
00:12:23.538 --> 00:12:24.809
Now we have more information.

382
00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:25.933
But it's very, very good,

383
00:12:25.933 --> 00:12:28.177
there is something coming out now,

384
00:12:28.177 --> 00:12:30.661
more and more understanding of this.

385
00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:32.548
<v Voiceover>Well, it sounds like we're not going</v>

386
00:12:32.548 --> 00:12:34.682
to be able to get past the scratching of the surface,

387
00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:36.946
but that gives us an idea that there are these spots

388
00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:38.212
with many factors.

389
00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:39.485
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

390
00:12:39.485 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Voiceover>A grid that has the matrices of which</v>

391
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.390
is made up, it sounds like,

392
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.558
of many different frequencies.

393
00:12:44.558 --> 00:12:45.827
<v ->Right, and then one thing about it,</v>

394
00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:48.066
the third thing, and then we'll get to the second in a bit,

395
00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.488
but the third thing of the intention,

396
00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:51.034
Sedona's a primary example.

397
00:12:51.034 --> 00:12:52.136
<v Voiceover>I was just going to ask you that.</v>

398
00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:54.134
<v ->There is no evidence whatsoever,</v>

399
00:12:54.134 --> 00:12:55.961
archaeologically or historically,

400
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:58.206
that Sedona was a sacred site to the Indians

401
00:12:58.206 --> 00:13:00.806
in archaic times and they aren't even very old around here.

402
00:13:00.806 --> 00:13:03.706
Hohokam and Sinagua, it's just a pass by place.

403
00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.346
And there was some farming activity

404
00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:06.750
that happened in Old Creek because it's,

405
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.284
you know, it's wet down there,

406
00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:09.245
and some things can grow,

407
00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:10.556
but this was not a holy place.

408
00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.613
And even the Yavapai-Apache and their place

409
00:13:12.613 --> 00:13:13.725
out in their enchantment,

410
00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:14.845
it's not old,

411
00:13:14.845 --> 00:13:16.123
they're 13th, 14th century,

412
00:13:16.123 --> 00:13:16.885
they're not old.

413
00:13:16.885 --> 00:13:18.425
And meant to me, 10th century,

414
00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:19.791
fourth century, it's not old,

415
00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:21.497
so this place was never a holy place.

416
00:13:21.497 --> 00:13:23.768
There are no vortexes here.

417
00:13:23.768 --> 00:13:25.937
There are none whatsoever and I can give you the history

418
00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:28.202
of how that notion of vortexes came out with

419
00:13:28.202 --> 00:13:29.929
Paige Brian, back in the late eight,

420
00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:31.166
or in the 80's,

421
00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:32.629
but there are no vortexes.

422
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:34.798
What there is, is there's ferous oxide here,

423
00:13:34.798 --> 00:13:36.747
which rusts and gives the rocks its redness.

424
00:13:36.747 --> 00:13:38.611
But the main thing about this place

425
00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:40.777
is by popular imagination,

426
00:13:40.777 --> 00:13:43.210
it's become sort of a mecca of the American

427
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.654
and the European and the Japanese new age community.

428
00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:46.921
So people are coming here,

429
00:13:46.921 --> 00:13:47.854
people are coming here,

430
00:13:47.854 --> 00:13:51.428
and there is a deposition of (inaudible),

431
00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:53.083
of energy and it's carried by the intention.

432
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:57.063
Just as film can record in a 250th of a second,

433
00:13:57.063 --> 00:13:58.135
can record something,

434
00:13:58.135 --> 00:13:59.266
like on my photographs,

435
00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:01.068
I just point this black box at something

436
00:14:01.068 --> 00:14:02.100
and I press a button.

437
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.360
Shutter goes across the film,

438
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.967
the film remembers what it sees.

439
00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:05.704
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

440
00:14:05.704 --> 00:14:07.338
<v ->Magnetic tape in a tape recorder,</v>

441
00:14:07.338 --> 00:14:08.742
you speak and then it remembers it.

442
00:14:08.742 --> 00:14:10.677
So you have a much bigger piece of earth,

443
00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:13.377
much longer, tens of 1,000's of people coming

444
00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:14.706
with hope in their heart,

445
00:14:14.706 --> 00:14:17.121
with a feeling of a mystical quest.

446
00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:17.884
<v Voiceover>And it works.</v>

447
00:14:17.884 --> 00:14:18.945
<v ->And it works,</v>

448
00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:21.082
they charge it with a power,

449
00:14:21.082 --> 00:14:22.721
and then the power attracts others.

450
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:23.988
And they come and they charge it.

451
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.417
So there's some sort of gratitude feedback loop

452
00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:27.728
that builds and builds and builds.

453
00:14:27.728 --> 00:14:29.558
That's why it's so important to come to Sedona.

454
00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:30.521
It definitely has a power.

455
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:32.832
But forget these silly vortexes.

456
00:14:32.832 --> 00:14:33.796
Forget them.

457
00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:35.561
Anywhere you go it has it.

458
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.466
<v Voiceover>The magic is happening.</v>

459
00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:38.327
<v ->The magic is all over the place.</v>

460
00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:39.378
<v Voiceover>Yes it is.</v>

461
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.331
So let's talk about some of the other sites,

462
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:43.439
and no first of all, let's talk about number two,

463
00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:44.843
did we get to number two?

464
00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:45.869
<v ->No saying.</v>

465
00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:47.079
<v Voiceover>Well, let's see, one, two,</v>

466
00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:49.317
what, we talked about number one,

467
00:14:49.317 --> 00:14:50.713
and we talked about number three.

468
00:14:50.713 --> 00:14:52.456
<v ->Oh, number two?</v>

469
00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:53.742
There's a lot of different factors

470
00:14:53.742 --> 00:14:56.520
that go into that particular major subcategory,

471
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.296
and I think the sacred geometry and sacred geography

472
00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:00.028
are really important.

473
00:15:00.028 --> 00:15:03.025
Sacred geography is the placement of these

474
00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:06.000
these shrines, these temples, these mosques,

475
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.503
pyramids, whatever you wanna call them,

476
00:15:07.503 --> 00:15:10.399
on what appears to be a global grid.

477
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.770
And some of it is oriented terrestrially,

478
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.376
and some of it is definitely, definitely oriented,

479
00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:17.544
extra-terrestrially, celestially,

480
00:15:17.544 --> 00:15:20.776
different sites have sort of alignments

481
00:15:20.776 --> 00:15:22.884
with the sun, the moon, the stars,

482
00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:23.986
and the planets, and then you got

483
00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.320
the procession of the equinoxes,

484
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.583
the minor lunar standstill,

485
00:15:26.583 --> 00:15:28.142
and all these different complex things.

486
00:15:28.142 --> 00:15:29.928
It gets more complex but there's that thing.

487
00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:32.294
But sacred geometry which means what is really,

488
00:15:32.294 --> 00:15:34.093
really fascinating in this regard.

489
00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:35.962
And people go what is sacred geometry?

490
00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:38.126
And I go it's just mathematics of nature.

491
00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:40.003
And it's the mathematics of music.

492
00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:42.533
The different musical tones and the different frequencies

493
00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:44.961
of the colors, it's all according to mathematics.

494
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:47.268
And people in antiquity, they just looked at nature,

495
00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:48.531
everywhere in front of you,

496
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.436
and then go oh, well, there's this,

497
00:15:50.436 --> 00:15:52.744
what they later came to call the Fibonacci series,

498
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.215
there's this replicating mathematical constants.

499
00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:56.411
So people saw them

500
00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:58.118
and then they began to put them in their own

501
00:15:58.118 --> 00:16:01.292
two dimensional art and three dimensional architecture.

502
00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:03.635
And it's the same thing as making a guitar

503
00:16:03.635 --> 00:16:04.862
or a flute,

504
00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:06.666
it's just sacred mathematics.

505
00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.719
Incredible mathematics that creates these

506
00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:10.624
harmonic energy chambers,

507
00:16:10.624 --> 00:16:12.568
so that when you go into a pyramid or a mosque

508
00:16:12.568 --> 00:16:13.732
or a church or a temple,

509
00:16:13.732 --> 00:16:15.506
whatever it is, a lot of these buildings are built

510
00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:18.068
with that mathematics and they just

511
00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:22.376
gather, concentrate, and radiate into a specific place

512
00:16:22.376 --> 00:16:25.092
the powers that are contained there.

513
00:16:25.092 --> 00:16:27.210
<v Voiceover>Such as the pyramids.</v>

514
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.416
<v ->Yes, such as the pyramids.</v>

515
00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Voiceover>Why don't we start there?</v>

516
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.888
That's a good place to begin.

517
00:16:30.888 --> 00:16:31.889
<v ->Well, there's the thing,</v>

518
00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:33.789
you always gotta look at there's this bifurcation,

519
00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.311
there's the Great Pyramid and there's

520
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:38.759
you know, the Osiron, the Sphinx temple,

521
00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:40.098
and the Valley temple and the Sphinx

522
00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:41.797
and the Reds Pyramid and a few other things.

523
00:16:41.797 --> 00:16:43.329
And then there's what is called old,

524
00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:45.465
middle, and new kingdom Egypt.

525
00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:47.402
It's nice stuff, it's very, very advanced.

526
00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:49.402
It's wonderful and interestingly enough

527
00:16:49.402 --> 00:16:51.709
it's most advanced at its very beginning,

528
00:16:51.709 --> 00:16:53.939
but then we have something before

529
00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:54.840
the Great Pyramid.

530
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.478
Now, there's no evidence whatsoever

531
00:16:56.478 --> 00:16:59.041
that the Egyptians built the pyramid,

532
00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:01.381
and this is something I can go into for six to eight hours

533
00:17:01.381 --> 00:17:03.383
no problem, but the Great Pyramid

534
00:17:03.383 --> 00:17:06.389
there is absolutely no kings and queens chamber in it.

535
00:17:06.389 --> 00:17:08.818
That's a notion that some archaeologist,

536
00:17:08.818 --> 00:17:11.194
a European archaeologist later named,

537
00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:12.587
they gave the biggest room to the guy

538
00:17:12.587 --> 00:17:13.593
and the smaller room to the girl,

539
00:17:13.593 --> 00:17:15.388
it's a stupid, idiotic idea.

540
00:17:15.388 --> 00:17:17.369
There was never a burial in it,

541
00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.432
or any Egyptian pyramid.

542
00:17:19.432 --> 00:17:20.805
<v Voiceover>But there was something.</v>

543
00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:23.266
<v ->Oh there was something inside of this big room,</v>

544
00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:24.140
the main room.
<v Voiceover>Can you talk,</v>

545
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.903
do you care to talk about that

546
00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:25.701
for just a little--
<v ->Yeah.</v>

547
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:26.977
<v Voiceover>Without getting too sidetracked</v>

548
00:17:26.977 --> 00:17:28.813
into ancient Egyptology.

549
00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:30.915
<v ->There's, inside of the main room,</v>

550
00:17:30.915 --> 00:17:33.709
which itself has tremendous, tremendous mathematics.

551
00:17:33.709 --> 00:17:35.516
Mathematics that are so sophisticated,

552
00:17:35.516 --> 00:17:38.109
we didn't again, figure them out in Europe,

553
00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:39.853
until let's say 1780.

554
00:17:39.853 --> 00:17:41.475
And the Greeks got everything they had

555
00:17:41.475 --> 00:17:42.888
in a sense of mathematical wisdom,

556
00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:44.360
from the Egyptians.

557
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.264
The Great Pyramid, and especially the room inside

558
00:17:47.264 --> 00:17:49.354
is of such extraordinary mathematics,

559
00:17:49.354 --> 00:17:51.849
we don't know how they made that big granite coffer,

560
00:17:51.849 --> 00:17:54.268
we don't, because they didn't have any metal carving tools,

561
00:17:54.268 --> 00:17:55.998
but if you look at it really close you see these

562
00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:58.260
big circular sort of marks on it,

563
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.433
like it was done with this big drill,

564
00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:02.472
and we don't know how that was made.

565
00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:04.735
And it didn't even,

566
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:06.279
it's not even positioned in a place

567
00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.980
of good direction it used to be positioned.

568
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.353
Because there was a thing that used to happen

569
00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:11.022
when, the box isn't where it used to be.

570
00:18:11.022 --> 00:18:12.691
The box was in another position.

571
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:15.249
Because when people went in there and they got in the box,

572
00:18:15.249 --> 00:18:16.786
especially at certain time periods,

573
00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:17.886
and they got in the box and their head

574
00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:18.930
was in a certain position,

575
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.664
relative to the box, relative to the chamber,

576
00:18:21.664 --> 00:18:23.131
relative to the pyramid,

577
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:25.926
vectoring in certain energies from below and above,

578
00:18:25.926 --> 00:18:29.336
it brings a certain energy to that box,

579
00:18:29.336 --> 00:18:30.537
to a person's head,

580
00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:32.441
that caused three things.

581
00:18:32.441 --> 00:18:34.174
Either flashes of enlightenment,

582
00:18:34.174 --> 00:18:37.339
flashes of and sometimes permanent insanity,

583
00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:39.337
or the disappearance of a person's body,

584
00:18:39.337 --> 00:18:41.316
and they are finding them in the chamber

585
00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:43.786
way, way down at the bottom of the pyramid later.

586
00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:45.344
Now how do you explain that?

587
00:18:45.344 --> 00:18:47.185
So what they did is they moved the box

588
00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:48.385
so those things didn't happen.

589
00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:50.428
And Napoleon, he even reports it.

590
00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:51.757
Because he was in there one night,

591
00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:54.187
and he said later, he wouldn't tell anybody what happened,

592
00:18:54.187 --> 00:18:55.827
but he said it was the most frightening

593
00:18:55.827 --> 00:18:57.930
evening of his entire life.

594
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.131
<v Voiceover>I know that some of this,</v>

595
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:01.363
and you used a lot of different sources,

596
00:19:01.363 --> 00:19:04.361
but you and I are both fans of Tony Bushby's work,

597
00:19:04.361 --> 00:19:05.904
and I hope to interview him one day.

598
00:19:05.904 --> 00:19:09.740
And some of this from the book The Secret in the Bible.

599
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.842
And which goes right back into the most ancient times

600
00:19:13.842 --> 00:19:16.218
in Egypt which you are speaking of.

601
00:19:16.218 --> 00:19:19.712
And there are so many areas of this I find fascinating

602
00:19:19.712 --> 00:19:21.316
because then you're getting into some of the

603
00:19:21.316 --> 00:19:24.717
greatest mysteries on Earth, really,

604
00:19:24.717 --> 00:19:26.297
isn't that what you're talking about?

605
00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:28.762
And isn't that really what people are somehow remembering

606
00:19:28.762 --> 00:19:30.301
or being drawn to when they go

607
00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:31.564
to the Great Pyramids?

608
00:19:31.564 --> 00:19:32.167
So tell-

609
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.532
<v ->Being drawn to, yes, yes.</v>

610
00:19:33.532 --> 00:19:34.403
<v Voiceover>Being drawn to, yes.</v>

611
00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:35.202
<v ->Without even knowing it,</v>

612
00:19:35.202 --> 00:19:37.664
you see there's a spiritual magnetism to these places.

613
00:19:37.664 --> 00:19:39.602
Think of a spiritual magnetism,

614
00:19:39.602 --> 00:19:41.471
there's actually qualities of these places,

615
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:43.773
energetic qualities that resonate with different

616
00:19:43.773 --> 00:19:45.515
parts of our, let's say soul nature,

617
00:19:45.515 --> 00:19:48.678
that reach out and pull on us,

618
00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:51.115
and infiltrate our dreams and our thoughts

619
00:19:51.115 --> 00:19:53.858
and our visions such that we wanna go there.

620
00:19:53.858 --> 00:19:55.891
That's one of the functions in these places,

621
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:56.993
and how they work.

622
00:19:56.993 --> 00:20:00.529
<v Voiceover>So if a person were to go there today,</v>

623
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:03.000
if you were going to guide them as to

624
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.364
going into, quote, the King's Chamber, today,

625
00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:09.137
what would you have them be alert for

626
00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:11.275
or have the true knowledge of

627
00:20:11.275 --> 00:20:14.119
what that experience could impart to them?

628
00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:16.039
<v ->As I often say to people,</v>

629
00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:19.470
I think a parallel journey through the archaeology

630
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.873
and mythology of a culture,

631
00:20:20.873 --> 00:20:21.945
before you go,

632
00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:24.184
is going to sort of predispose you

633
00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:25.490
to an even deeper experience.

634
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.020
I think it's really neat to know some of that,

635
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.611
but I'm a scholar and I like that stuff,

636
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:30.625
and I read thousands of books, literally.

637
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.120
But if you don't wanna do all that

638
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.094
and you're just gonna go,

639
00:20:33.094 --> 00:20:35.026
just go and be, that's it,

640
00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.548
when you put a tea bag in water

641
00:20:36.548 --> 00:20:37.627
does the tea bag have to think

642
00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:39.595
I'm gonna be red zinger or mint,

643
00:20:39.595 --> 00:20:41.559
no it just steeps into the water.

644
00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:42.868
And the power of these places

645
00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:45.836
just steeps into your heart and soul and mind.

646
00:20:45.836 --> 00:20:47.676
All you have to do is go and be.

647
00:20:47.676 --> 00:20:48.299
<v Voiceover>Show up.</v>

648
00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:49.380
<v ->That's it, just go and be.</v>

649
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.310
Nothing more.

650
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.907
If you wanna chant a mantra or carry some quartz crystals

651
00:20:52.907 --> 00:20:55.444
or wave a rattler, do something with sage,

652
00:20:55.444 --> 00:20:56.785
you can do it, you don't need to do it,

653
00:20:56.785 --> 00:20:58.345
that's cute, that's all it is, it's cute.

654
00:20:58.345 --> 00:20:59.424
You don't need to do any of it,

655
00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.220
it's so simple.

656
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.618
Like when you plug electrical appliance into the wall,

657
00:21:03.618 --> 00:21:05.461
do you gotta stand around and know physics?

658
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:07.260
No, you just plug it in and it works.

659
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.150
Same thing with us,

660
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.794
we go to these places, that's enough.

661
00:21:09.794 --> 00:21:11.354
<v Voiceover>And the truth is, we're being affected</v>

662
00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:12.400
on subtle levels,

663
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.803
we're not even aware of,

664
00:21:13.803 --> 00:21:17.395
so to think that you went in and you come out

665
00:21:17.395 --> 00:21:18.469
of one of these sites,

666
00:21:18.469 --> 00:21:19.971
and you don't have a major vision,

667
00:21:19.971 --> 00:21:22.698
that nothing happened is untrue.

668
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:26.580
I think that that's a really important point to get across.

669
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.438
It doesn't mean nothing has happened.

670
00:21:28.438 --> 00:21:30.418
<v ->Right, and two things there that brings up,</v>

671
00:21:30.418 --> 00:21:31.650
my mind, is one thing is,

672
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.617
actually too much ceremony,

673
00:21:33.617 --> 00:21:35.754
often times, gets in the way of something happening.

674
00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:37.625
Because people go oh, I know what to do here.

675
00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:38.578
No, no, no, no.

676
00:21:38.578 --> 00:21:39.721
That place is older than you,

677
00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:40.731
that place is bigger than you,

678
00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:42.232
have some humility.

679
00:21:42.232 --> 00:21:44.297
Just go in and be empty, be free.

680
00:21:44.297 --> 00:21:47.582
The second thing is seeds are sown.

681
00:21:47.582 --> 00:21:50.471
You don't get a full grown tree or a rosebush

682
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:52.031
in one day, no, no, no.

683
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:52.842
A seed is sown.

684
00:21:52.842 --> 00:21:54.811
And it grows and maybe it will sprout

685
00:21:54.811 --> 00:21:56.045
and bear fruit,

686
00:21:56.045 --> 00:21:57.978
in ways that are unexpected for you

687
00:21:57.978 --> 00:22:00.558
and you might even miss them later on.

688
00:22:00.558 --> 00:22:02.386
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about some of the other places,</v>

689
00:22:02.386 --> 00:22:04.251
let's move out of Egypt for a bit,

690
00:22:04.251 --> 00:22:05.789
and take a little,

691
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:08.218
a little globe plot trotting tour,

692
00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:09.759
and we're gonna be showing these visuals

693
00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:10.758
at the same time.

694
00:22:10.758 --> 00:22:13.289
What are some of the most profound sites

695
00:22:13.289 --> 00:22:17.123
in terms of their mystical emanation that you have visited?

696
00:22:17.123 --> 00:22:19.898
And if you can speak a little bit about each one.

697
00:22:19.898 --> 00:22:21.866
<v ->Okay, well then, emanation and then</v>

698
00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:24.833
a qualification on emanation is mystical emanation.

699
00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:26.030
<v Voiceover>Mystical emanation, right.</v>

700
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.808
<v ->Not all power places are mystical.</v>

701
00:22:28.808 --> 00:22:30.804
Some power places are healing sites,

702
00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:32.315
and there's a specific quality there,

703
00:22:32.315 --> 00:22:33.705
that may affect women or men,

704
00:22:33.705 --> 00:22:35.516
may affect the kidneys, may affect the eyes,

705
00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:36.620
may affect the skin.

706
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about some of that,</v>

707
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.387
give some prime examples.

708
00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:40.537
That's really useful information.

709
00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:43.580
<v ->Oh, gosh, well, there's--</v>

710
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.123
<v Voiceover>Let's start with a masculine place</v>

711
00:22:45.123 --> 00:22:46.917
that might heal for the masculine.

712
00:22:46.917 --> 00:22:48.230
Let's start with a feminine place.

713
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.897
<v ->Okay, well then, heal for the masculine,</v>

714
00:22:49.897 --> 00:22:51.291
heal for the masculine in the archetype

715
00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:52.533
or the psychology of the masculine

716
00:22:52.533 --> 00:22:54.391
or the actual physical ailment, see,

717
00:22:54.391 --> 00:22:55.169
there's differences there.

718
00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:56.761
<v Voiceover>No, it's okay, let's do one of each.</v>

719
00:22:56.761 --> 00:22:59.511
One for the archetypal energy, one for the healing energy

720
00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.303
for the masculine.

721
00:23:00.303 --> 00:23:01.567
We'll do the same for the feminine.

722
00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:03.345
<v ->Okay, well, what comes to my mind for an archetype</v>

723
00:23:03.345 --> 00:23:04.107
of the masculine,

724
00:23:04.107 --> 00:23:06.316
and even though there are three reputed locations

725
00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:08.513
of Sinai that I, actually at this point,

726
00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:12.320
accept the Mount Sinai that is in a certain part of Egypt.

727
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.021
This place has a tremendous, it has a value--

728
00:23:15.021 --> 00:23:16.157
<v Voiceover>Does that mean Mount Horeb</v>

729
00:23:16.157 --> 00:23:18.326
or Mount Sinai, literally, okay.

730
00:23:18.326 --> 00:23:19.918
<v ->Yeah, Mount Sinai in Egypt,</v>

731
00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:21.761
I'll give you a great picture of it from my website.

732
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:23.930
National Geographic used that in it's recent book,

733
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:24.800
by the way.

734
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.432
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

735
00:23:25.432 --> 00:23:27.935
<v ->That place though, is beneficial for women to go to.</v>

736
00:23:27.935 --> 00:23:30.496
It's especially beneficial for men to go to.

737
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:32.865
Not because of Christianity or Judaism,

738
00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:35.245
those are recent historical overlays

739
00:23:35.245 --> 00:23:37.406
on something that's far beyond them in time.

740
00:23:37.406 --> 00:23:39.043
There's something at that place

741
00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:40.543
that for young men to go to,

742
00:23:40.543 --> 00:23:42.820
it assists them, really what it does,

743
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.648
is it's a sort of rite of passage place,

744
00:23:45.648 --> 00:23:47.019
it's a place that if you go there,

745
00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:48.481
there's these certain sort of stages

746
00:23:48.481 --> 00:23:50.718
that we as men and women go through in our lives,

747
00:23:50.718 --> 00:23:53.409
and we can sort of get a little bit of assistance

748
00:23:53.409 --> 00:23:55.428
in transiting difficult times.

749
00:23:55.428 --> 00:23:58.401
And Mount Sinai definitely has that quality for young,

750
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.264
middle aged, and old aged men.

751
00:24:00.264 --> 00:24:01.227
Really, really does.

752
00:24:01.227 --> 00:24:02.536
Really, really does.

753
00:24:02.536 --> 00:24:04.303
<v Voiceover>What about for healing for men?</v>

754
00:24:04.303 --> 00:24:05.776
<v ->Well, again--</v>

755
00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:08.946
<v Voiceover>We're, I know this is crass because</v>

756
00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:11.239
we're having to make it really base and simple.

757
00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:14.501
And they have to go to your site and study your work

758
00:24:14.501 --> 00:24:15.420
and they'll get more,

759
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.846
but I would love for us all to know,

760
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.789
just a little thumb nail sketch of something.

761
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:21.288
<v ->Okay, well there's a place in,</v>

762
00:24:21.288 --> 00:24:24.144
it's always important to look up what is the gender,

763
00:24:24.144 --> 00:24:26.593
what is the sex of the primary deity of the shrine?

764
00:24:26.593 --> 00:24:28.092
And throw out that rubbish,

765
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:30.591
that feminist rubbish, that all goddess,

766
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:31.666
their all goddess sites,

767
00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:32.993
it's Mother Earth, it's not Mother Earth,

768
00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:34.573
it's an androgynous being.

769
00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:35.960
It's both.

770
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.535
But for the gender of the primary deity,

771
00:24:38.535 --> 00:24:41.206
there's a place in Mexico called Izamal.

772
00:24:41.206 --> 00:24:42.108
Beautiful picture.

773
00:24:42.108 --> 00:24:42.907
<v Voiceover>How do you spell that?</v>

774
00:24:42.907 --> 00:24:44.813
<v ->I-Z-A-M-A-L.</v>

775
00:24:44.813 --> 00:24:47.384
Izamal, in Yucatán, near Mérida.

776
00:24:47.384 --> 00:24:48.674
And there is a shrine there,

777
00:24:48.674 --> 00:24:51.654
this beautiful pyramid, it's now torn down,

778
00:24:51.654 --> 00:24:54.323
the Spaniards tore it down in like 1525.

779
00:24:54.323 --> 00:24:56.215
And then they built this monastery

780
00:24:56.215 --> 00:24:58.357
and they put in a statue of Mary,

781
00:24:58.357 --> 00:25:00.954
and there's all these miracles of healing attributed to Mary

782
00:25:00.954 --> 00:25:03.355
but if we do a little bit of research into the Mayans,

783
00:25:03.355 --> 00:25:06.568
we find out, oh, this was a healing site for a Mayan deity

784
00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:09.050
named Itzamna.

785
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.004
And Itzamana was a god of healing.

786
00:25:11.004 --> 00:25:13.306
So what this means is it's a yang point,

787
00:25:13.306 --> 00:25:15.575
primarily for men, beneficial for men,

788
00:25:15.575 --> 00:25:16.946
and it's a healing site.

789
00:25:16.946 --> 00:25:20.949
Now we don't know exactly what the particular ailments were

790
00:25:20.949 --> 00:25:24.187
that Itzamana seemed to be beneficial for.

791
00:25:24.187 --> 00:25:26.378
But he's a primary deity so chances are

792
00:25:26.378 --> 00:25:27.519
it was a lot of them.

793
00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:28.687
So there you have--

794
00:25:28.687 --> 00:25:31.626
<v Voiceover>An example of male rites of passage</v>

795
00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:32.710
and also male healing.

796
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:33.386
<v ->Right.</v>

797
00:25:33.386 --> 00:25:34.695
And so then if you go to Ireland

798
00:25:34.695 --> 00:25:36.021
and you find all these shrines,

799
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:37.767
these healing springs,

800
00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:38.764
they're not dedicated to Mary,

801
00:25:38.764 --> 00:25:40.438
they're usually dedicated to Brigid.

802
00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:41.293
Saint Brigid.

803
00:25:41.293 --> 00:25:44.103
Well, there was these goddess prior to the arrival

804
00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:47.141
of Christianity and basically around the first century

805
00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:48.608
second century AD,

806
00:25:48.608 --> 00:25:50.779
there was this goddess there of healing.

807
00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:53.408
And you find her at a lot of these shrines

808
00:25:53.408 --> 00:25:56.190
and the forest glades in Ireland,

809
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.081
I've been to about 50 of them, I love them very much,

810
00:25:58.081 --> 00:25:59.547
they're such magical places.

811
00:25:59.547 --> 00:26:00.621
You go there, you feel like,

812
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:02.084
ooh, I'm back in the 11th century.

813
00:26:02.084 --> 00:26:03.449
It's wonderful.

814
00:26:03.449 --> 00:26:04.991
<v Voiceover>Are there some names of any of it,</v>

815
00:26:04.991 --> 00:26:05.994
and places, locations?

816
00:26:05.994 --> 00:26:07.694
<v ->Yeah, they're listed on my website.</v>

817
00:26:07.694 --> 00:26:08.459
<v Voiceover>They're listed on your website?</v>

818
00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:09.800
<v ->The healing shrines of Ireland.</v>

819
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.455
<v Voiceover>Okay, so these are healing shrines</v>

820
00:26:11.455 --> 00:26:13.562
for the female, for the feminine?

821
00:26:13.562 --> 00:26:14.605
<v ->Right.</v>

822
00:26:14.605 --> 00:26:17.508
And you would ask one of mystical power.

823
00:26:17.508 --> 00:26:19.469
<v Voiceover>Yes, and now mystical power from them.</v>

824
00:26:19.469 --> 00:26:21.268
<v ->Okay, so what I would qualify those as,</v>

825
00:26:21.268 --> 00:26:23.613
is places where people have had these experiences,

826
00:26:23.613 --> 00:26:26.617
that our languages give words to like,

827
00:26:26.617 --> 00:26:28.815
satori, nirvana, moksha,

828
00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:31.344
(inaudible), illumination, awakening,

829
00:26:31.344 --> 00:26:32.977
all of these things, okay.

830
00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:34.959
Shambhala is a place, Shamabhala is not an experience.

831
00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:36.115
<v Voiceover>It represents the experience.</v>

832
00:26:36.115 --> 00:26:37.727
I'm using it like magical.

833
00:26:37.727 --> 00:26:40.061
<v ->Places that, for a variety of reasons,</v>

834
00:26:40.061 --> 00:26:42.757
have given rise to human beings have those experience

835
00:26:42.757 --> 00:26:45.128
that they later talk about them with those words.

836
00:26:45.128 --> 00:26:47.395
Satori is not satori, satori is a word.

837
00:26:47.395 --> 00:26:49.496
You read the word satori, you don't get the experience.

838
00:26:49.496 --> 00:26:51.807
Okay, but there are places that have a quality

839
00:26:51.807 --> 00:26:55.908
that either catalyzes an awakening of consciousness,

840
00:26:55.908 --> 00:26:58.708
or further amplifies that which is already there.

841
00:26:58.708 --> 00:27:00.681
So these are places where you can plug in,

842
00:27:00.681 --> 00:27:03.787
why did Buddha go to where he went, the Bodhi tree?

843
00:27:03.787 --> 00:27:05.642
We not only have the Buddah say oh,

844
00:27:05.642 --> 00:27:07.482
it's where the Buddha of the three previous ages also

845
00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:08.681
attained enlightenment,

846
00:27:08.681 --> 00:27:11.259
but numerous sages had already gone there.

847
00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:13.196
You go to Bodh Gaya in India,

848
00:27:13.196 --> 00:27:14.196
where the Bodhi tree is,

849
00:27:14.196 --> 00:27:16.723
you go to a place another great photograph of mine,

850
00:27:16.723 --> 00:27:20.035
a Jain sacred site in Ghughra, India,

851
00:27:20.035 --> 00:27:21.996
called Shatrunjay .

852
00:27:21.996 --> 00:27:25.476
In Jainism there are what are called 14 tirthankaras,

853
00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:26.630
these realized beings.

854
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.013
11 of them attained realization on that mountain.

855
00:27:30.013 --> 00:27:31.901
<v Voiceover>What is the name of the mountain again?</v>

856
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:34.654
<v ->Shatrunjay.</v>

857
00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:37.709
I could spell it, but Shatrunjay.

858
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.903
There's a legend, there's a myth,

859
00:27:39.903 --> 00:27:42.383
that 11 people obtained spiritual awakening at this place.

860
00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:43.958
If you're traveling in India,

861
00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:45.693
wouldn't it make sense to go over there

862
00:27:45.693 --> 00:27:46.596
for a few minutes,

863
00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:48.827
by the way it's the most beautiful temple complex

864
00:27:48.827 --> 00:27:50.264
in all of Western India,

865
00:27:50.264 --> 00:27:51.291
so you're gonna see great art,

866
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:52.691
monumental architecture.

867
00:27:52.691 --> 00:27:53.690
<v Voiceover>And I see you have great photographs</v>

868
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.498
of this we're showing, right?

869
00:27:54.498 --> 00:27:55.437
<v ->Yes, so why not go?</v>

870
00:27:55.437 --> 00:27:56.999
And if there's a possibility that I might get

871
00:27:56.999 --> 00:27:59.601
some clearer knowledge about my soul and life,

872
00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:01.005
what's wrong with that?

873
00:28:01.005 --> 00:28:03.266
That's what these mystical places are.

874
00:28:03.266 --> 00:28:07.015
And every single religion, major religious figure

875
00:28:07.015 --> 00:28:08.477
founder on this planet,

876
00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:11.284
I can trace their awakening and enlightening experiences

877
00:28:11.284 --> 00:28:12.816
to sites.

878
00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:13.890
<v Voiceover>Okay, let's do it.</v>

879
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.577
<v ->They're place specific, they're place specific.</v>

880
00:28:15.577 --> 00:28:17.260
<v Voiceover>Let's do it, give me a couple.</v>

881
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.262
<v ->Well, the four major,</v>

882
00:28:18.262 --> 00:28:21.363
four major holy places in the life of that guy, Jesus?

883
00:28:22.863 --> 00:28:26.099
they're all caves, and they're all known as sacred sites,

884
00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:28.189
long before he was born.

885
00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:30.594
<v Voiceover>I gotta ask you a question, right here and now</v>

886
00:28:30.594 --> 00:28:31.700
about that.

887
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.537
I had, probably the most, profound single experience

888
00:28:35.537 --> 00:28:38.580
of my life in (inaudible) at the cave,

889
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.745
where the monastery to John the Baptist is now,

890
00:28:41.745 --> 00:28:43.180
above the well.

891
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.354
What's up with that?

892
00:28:44.354 --> 00:28:46.316
And did that have anything to do with this?

893
00:28:46.316 --> 00:28:47.189
<v ->Same thing, same thing.</v>

894
00:28:47.189 --> 00:28:49.188
Known long before he was around.

895
00:28:49.188 --> 00:28:50.793
Bushby, Tony Bushby by the way,

896
00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:52.650
Secret of the Bible and The Bible Code,

897
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.488
ooh, lots of really good information on John the Baptist.

898
00:28:55.488 --> 00:28:56.799
If people would read it and go whoa,

899
00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:58.049
I didn't know that.

900
00:28:58.049 --> 00:29:00.262
<v Voiceover>Well, I'm sure because I haven't read</v>

901
00:29:00.262 --> 00:29:02.700
the previous one, I'll be included in that group,

902
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.666
but I can tell you that that's, that space,

903
00:29:04.666 --> 00:29:07.938
that cave, is unlike anything I've ever experienced.

904
00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:10.233
So let's talk about where a few of the places

905
00:29:10.233 --> 00:29:11.843
that Jesus attained enlightenment,

906
00:29:11.843 --> 00:29:13.130
within the area?

907
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.646
<v ->According, there's no evidence in the New Testament</v>

908
00:29:15.646 --> 00:29:17.520
whatsoever that he was born on Christmas Day.

909
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.985
The Romans took over that.

910
00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:20.558
<v Voiceover>We get that, that's a lot of Pagan stuff.</v>

911
00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:22.492
<v ->You know, winter solstice and all that,</v>

912
00:29:22.492 --> 00:29:24.957
so according to some myths, some legends,

913
00:29:24.957 --> 00:29:28.307
he was born in this cave, in Bethlehem.

914
00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:29.592
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

915
00:29:29.592 --> 00:29:31.257
<v ->Okay, so you can go into that cave.</v>

916
00:29:31.257 --> 00:29:32.831
You'll find these four pictures on my website.

917
00:29:32.831 --> 00:29:34.132
You can go into that cave.

918
00:29:34.132 --> 00:29:36.332
Then, when he's a young boy,

919
00:29:36.332 --> 00:29:39.041
Mary has a vision that he's in danger,

920
00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:41.774
so they flee to Egypt for two years and six months,

921
00:29:41.774 --> 00:29:43.569
and they stay in another cave in a place called

922
00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:45.113
Del Muharraq.

923
00:29:45.113 --> 00:29:48.045
And then when he's a younger man,

924
00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:49.744
he has the temptation,

925
00:29:49.744 --> 00:29:50.834
the period of the temptation,

926
00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:52.849
so he spends 40 days in a cave,

927
00:29:52.849 --> 00:29:54.658
above the old city of Jericho,

928
00:29:54.658 --> 00:29:56.357
it's called (inaudible).

929
00:29:56.357 --> 00:29:59.618
And then where the resurrection occurred,

930
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:02.297
the tomb of the holy sepulcher.

931
00:30:02.297 --> 00:30:03.023
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

932
00:30:03.023 --> 00:30:05.901
Beautiful place.
<v ->Beautiful place.</v>

933
00:30:05.901 --> 00:30:07.703
In Jerusalem, so these four caves,

934
00:30:07.703 --> 00:30:10.603
all caves, all caves,

935
00:30:10.603 --> 00:30:12.138
all sacred places known,

936
00:30:12.138 --> 00:30:16.347
1,000 years before Mary or Jesus ever heard of.

937
00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.407
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about this,</v>

938
00:30:17.407 --> 00:30:20.181
because I do understand this,

939
00:30:20.181 --> 00:30:23.070
both intuitively and there's some empirical sense,

940
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.326
there's something about caves placed in these areas,

941
00:30:27.891 --> 00:30:29.448
there's something about the energy of caves

942
00:30:29.448 --> 00:30:31.893
that cannot be duplicated in any other way,

943
00:30:31.893 --> 00:30:34.069
except the emanation of those fields.

944
00:30:34.069 --> 00:30:35.395
Can you talk about what's happening

945
00:30:35.395 --> 00:30:37.531
in these cave areas?

946
00:30:37.531 --> 00:30:38.363
<v ->Well, one thing you can,</v>

947
00:30:38.363 --> 00:30:40.103
it's really helpful to talk about,

948
00:30:40.103 --> 00:30:42.265
in a sense of sacred sites and power places,

949
00:30:42.265 --> 00:30:46.795
is this notion of portals and interdimensionality.

950
00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:49.343
That what you see is not the only thing that's there.

951
00:30:49.343 --> 00:30:50.181
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

952
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.281
<v ->There's other dimensions,</v>

953
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.235
and there are dimensional sort of access points

954
00:30:54.235 --> 00:30:55.250
that are portals.

955
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.438
And so you're at one of these things,

956
00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:58.685
it's not like oh, the space opens up

957
00:30:58.685 --> 00:31:00.619
and I walk back into the 11th century, no,

958
00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:02.086
you're staying in the 20th century,

959
00:31:02.086 --> 00:31:03.660
but there's an energetic portal

960
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.757
where you're having access to another dimension

961
00:31:05.757 --> 00:31:06.858
at the same time.

962
00:31:06.858 --> 00:31:09.993
And caves are tremendous energetic portals

963
00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:12.668
that funnel, first of all, gather,

964
00:31:12.668 --> 00:31:14.800
concentrate, and then funnel or radiate

965
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.657
into that space.

966
00:31:15.657 --> 00:31:17.730
Ooh, super terrestrial energy.

967
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Voiceover>Unbelievable.</v>

968
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.103
I mean, I won't even go into it,

969
00:31:20.103 --> 00:31:21.398
but it's just mind blowing.

970
00:31:21.398 --> 00:31:22.971
<v ->Many, many of the sacred caves in antiquity</v>

971
00:31:22.971 --> 00:31:24.646
are dedicated to goddesses more than gods.

972
00:31:24.646 --> 00:31:27.949
A lot of yang deities are dedicated to the mountains.

973
00:31:27.949 --> 00:31:29.820
And it's not again, because the men

974
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.256
took over the feminine sites.

975
00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:33.435
<v Voiceover>No, I mean, energetically, it makes sense.</v>

976
00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:36.126
A gathering of energy versus a projection of energy,

977
00:31:36.126 --> 00:31:37.723
it makes perfect, logical sense.

978
00:31:37.723 --> 00:31:38.620
<v ->Sometimes though, you do find,</v>

979
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.116
yin sacred mountain and yang cave.

980
00:31:41.116 --> 00:31:42.725
Which is really interesting.

981
00:31:42.725 --> 00:31:45.733
<v Voiceover>So we've got Jesus in those four sites,</v>

982
00:31:45.733 --> 00:31:47.761
now what about Buddha?

983
00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:49.171
<v ->Well, Buddha, you know, like,</v>

984
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:52.340
oh, I have a great essay on the sacred sites of Buddhism

985
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.376
on my website, like 10 pages long,

986
00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:55.874
really nice, juicy information.

987
00:31:55.874 --> 00:31:58.846
But there were initially four sacred places in Buddhism.

988
00:31:58.846 --> 00:32:00.679
Where he was born, Lumbini.

989
00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:04.046
Where he attained enlightenment, Bodh Gaya.

990
00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:07.249
Where he gave his first sermon, Sarnath.

991
00:32:07.249 --> 00:32:09.694
And where he died, Kushinagar.

992
00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:12.989
But then, when he died, his relics were gathered

993
00:32:12.989 --> 00:32:15.498
and they were put in eight different places.

994
00:32:15.498 --> 00:32:17.728
And then these relics were further divided

995
00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:19.433
and put in many, many other different places

996
00:32:19.433 --> 00:32:21.427
around India and around Asia.

997
00:32:21.427 --> 00:32:23.907
A lot of the relics weren't actually the relics of Buddha.

998
00:32:23.907 --> 00:32:26.670
But this horde of relics started spreading

999
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.965
and then these became Buddha's sacred sites,

1000
00:32:28.965 --> 00:32:31.273
but the initial four were the ones that I named.

1001
00:32:31.273 --> 00:32:32.614
<v Voiceover>Okay, that's--</v>

1002
00:32:32.614 --> 00:32:35.919
<v ->Then again, well especially Bodh Gaya and Sarnath,</v>

1003
00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:37.486
they were already known as holy places.

1004
00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:39.478
Lumbini and Kushinagar were not.

1005
00:32:39.478 --> 00:32:41.409
They're specific to Buddha.

1006
00:32:41.409 --> 00:32:43.549
<v Voiceover>Let's go to Muhammad.</v>

1007
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:47.677
<v ->Well, I was just, I just had the wonderful opportunity</v>

1008
00:32:47.677 --> 00:32:49.229
just a few months ago.

1009
00:32:49.229 --> 00:32:50.524
<v Voiceover>You were there at the same time.</v>

1010
00:32:50.524 --> 00:32:52.688
<v ->And in January I was in Saudi Arabia</v>

1011
00:32:52.688 --> 00:32:56.388
at, doing the Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina,

1012
00:32:56.388 --> 00:32:57.262
to Mecca.

1013
00:32:57.262 --> 00:32:58.869
<v Voiceover>And let's talk about Mecca and Medina,</v>

1014
00:32:58.869 --> 00:33:00.602
I really wanna know more about those.

1015
00:33:00.602 --> 00:33:01.708
<v ->Well one thing I have to say is,</v>

1016
00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:03.377
I have been doing a really, again,

1017
00:33:03.377 --> 00:33:05.846
good, solid anthropology from the inside.

1018
00:33:05.846 --> 00:33:07.513
Field research of Islam,

1019
00:33:07.513 --> 00:33:09.150
study of Islam for the last 10 years.

1020
00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.519
I actually did the conversion process to Islam

1021
00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:15.157
in Morocco 10 years ago and then have,

1022
00:33:15.157 --> 00:33:18.264
as a result, done every major pilgrimage shrine

1023
00:33:18.264 --> 00:33:20.845
from Indonesia to French West Africa.

1024
00:33:20.845 --> 00:33:23.825
All of Islam, and Islam, oh,

1025
00:33:23.825 --> 00:33:26.104
they're such wonderfully kind, peaceful people.

1026
00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:26.725
<v Voiceover>Yes, they are.</v>

1027
00:33:26.725 --> 00:33:28.232
<v ->At a street level, at a village level,</v>

1028
00:33:28.232 --> 00:33:30.333
it produces the kindest people

1029
00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:31.372
of any religion in the world.

1030
00:33:31.372 --> 00:33:32.807
Even more than Hinduism or Buddhism.

1031
00:33:32.807 --> 00:33:35.167
And there's hardly any Islamic terrorists,

1032
00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:37.179
and a lot of them are misunderstood by the West,

1033
00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:39.312
and all of it is in response to the oppression

1034
00:33:39.312 --> 00:33:40.781
of Judaism and Christianity,

1035
00:33:40.781 --> 00:33:42.948
and the political states that came out of them.

1036
00:33:42.948 --> 00:33:44.985
But Islam is a wonderful place.

1037
00:33:44.985 --> 00:33:47.756
And once a year, on a lunar calendar,

1038
00:33:47.756 --> 00:33:48.850
Islams have a lunar calendar,

1039
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.095
so it's never at the same time each year,

1040
00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:52.855
it sort of precesses back in time,

1041
00:33:52.855 --> 00:33:55.151
there is this enormous festival,

1042
00:33:55.151 --> 00:33:57.841
where about now three and a half million people come

1043
00:33:57.841 --> 00:33:59.900
to this place called Mecca

1044
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.098
to be near this box, this black box,

1045
00:34:03.098 --> 00:34:04.707
it's fabric covered by the way,

1046
00:34:04.707 --> 00:34:06.702
called the kaba, meaning cube in Arabic,

1047
00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:09.246
and then they do this ritual four day walk

1048
00:34:09.246 --> 00:34:12.239
to the plane of Nina and mount Arathot and

1049
00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.381
these different places

1050
00:34:13.381 --> 00:34:14.978
and they do these rituals, these actions,

1051
00:34:14.978 --> 00:34:17.116
that Mohammad did in catch this.

1052
00:34:17.116 --> 00:34:19.014
Even the Islamic scholars will admit,

1053
00:34:19.014 --> 00:34:22.357
95% of a Hajj, is preislamic ritual.

1054
00:34:22.357 --> 00:34:23.321
They will admit it.

1055
00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:25.225
It actually is, and where the kaba is

1056
00:34:25.225 --> 00:34:27.861
was not only, people say, well it was the intersection,

1057
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:30.264
Mecca was the intersection of two pilgrimage routes,

1058
00:34:30.264 --> 00:34:31.299
I mean two trade routes.

1059
00:34:31.299 --> 00:34:33.570
Yeah, why is trade coming there?

1060
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:34.731
Because there were people there.

1061
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:36.270
Why were people there?

1062
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.240
Because they found a power place.

1063
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.769
And then a few people settled,

1064
00:34:39.769 --> 00:34:41.201
and it's a few more and a few more,

1065
00:34:41.201 --> 00:34:42.512
and a few more, and a collection of families

1066
00:34:42.512 --> 00:34:44.370
turns into a small village and a large town

1067
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.848
and then people are gonna supply it

1068
00:34:45.848 --> 00:34:48.443
with material goods and so trade routes developed,

1069
00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:50.886
but Mecca was not, there's no evidence of military,

1070
00:34:50.886 --> 00:34:53.648
political, or economic activity in antiquity,

1071
00:34:53.648 --> 00:34:55.990
it's a holy place that attracts people

1072
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:57.760
by its spiritual magnetism.

1073
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.130
And so when you go to Mecca and there's three and a half

1074
00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.987
million people doing the same thing,

1075
00:35:01.987 --> 00:35:03.599
oh, it's magnificent.

1076
00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.797
<v Voiceover>Then you're adding in, also,</v>

1077
00:35:05.797 --> 00:35:08.038
the geometry of the structures

1078
00:35:08.038 --> 00:35:10.506
and you're also adding in the intention of the people

1079
00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:13.268
so could you just wanna talk for a moment

1080
00:35:13.268 --> 00:35:15.812
about what it's like to be at Hajj

1081
00:35:15.812 --> 00:35:19.149
and Mecca with this power of intention,

1082
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:21.980
besides just your big side ah.

1083
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.486
<v ->Well, one of the things is,</v>

1084
00:35:23.486 --> 00:35:24.685
it's so wonderful being in a place

1085
00:35:24.685 --> 00:35:25.751
and you'll see,

1086
00:35:25.751 --> 00:35:27.748
people say oh I don't like the Islamic people

1087
00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:28.591
and I go, what do you mean,

1088
00:35:28.591 --> 00:35:30.694
Japanese or Alaskans or Canadians

1089
00:35:30.694 --> 00:35:32.551
or Americans, or Swiss or Dutch,

1090
00:35:32.551 --> 00:35:33.423
or Bolivians?

1091
00:35:33.423 --> 00:35:34.595
What do you mean you don't like Islamic people?

1092
00:35:34.595 --> 00:35:36.326
'Cause it's the most spread out religion in the world,

1093
00:35:36.326 --> 00:35:37.056
they're everywhere.

1094
00:35:37.056 --> 00:35:38.495
So to say I don't like Islamic people,

1095
00:35:38.495 --> 00:35:40.225
is to me an indication of one thing.

1096
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:43.000
Your stupidity and geopolitical ignorance.

1097
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.061
There's no such thing as Islamic people

1098
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:47.077
as a separate group, okay.

1099
00:35:47.077 --> 00:35:49.542
So the Islamic people you meet

1100
00:35:49.542 --> 00:35:50.943
from all these different countries,

1101
00:35:50.943 --> 00:35:53.051
everybody's so happy and wonderful.

1102
00:35:53.051 --> 00:35:54.671
Nobody speaks the same language.

1103
00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:55.981
They speak, if there's 100 countries,

1104
00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:57.215
it's 100 different languages.

1105
00:35:57.215 --> 00:35:59.280
Arabic is just the language of the Koran.

1106
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.790
And some of them say some of the things

1107
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.815
in Koran but a lot of them say it in Swahili or Dutch

1108
00:36:02.815 --> 00:36:05.093
or Spanish, whatever language they're in.

1109
00:36:05.093 --> 00:36:06.920
That's real stupid, everybody there's this connection.

1110
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.261
So that's beautiful.

1111
00:36:08.261 --> 00:36:10.366
But then when you get so many people,

1112
00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:12.787
in the same place,

1113
00:36:12.787 --> 00:36:15.062
ah, the charging of the energy,

1114
00:36:15.062 --> 00:36:18.364
like, twice I've been to the largest pilgrimage festival

1115
00:36:18.364 --> 00:36:20.442
in the world which is in Allahabad in India

1116
00:36:20.442 --> 00:36:21.540
called the Kumbh Mela,

1117
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.475
and you get, once I was there with 12 million

1118
00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:25.669
and once I was there with 17 million people.

1119
00:36:25.669 --> 00:36:27.818
The Hajj only gets three and a half

1120
00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.147
but it's in just a few days.

1121
00:36:29.147 --> 00:36:31.550
And they're packed into the one place.

1122
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.283
Oh, gosh, I mean, the closest thing

1123
00:36:35.283 --> 00:36:36.549
most people could think of,

1124
00:36:36.549 --> 00:36:38.989
is if they were on a spring day at lunchtime

1125
00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:40.345
on avenue in America,

1126
00:36:40.345 --> 00:36:42.125
Avenue of the America's in New York.

1127
00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:43.263
A lot of people come out,

1128
00:36:43.263 --> 00:36:44.664
a lot of people come out,

1129
00:36:44.664 --> 00:36:46.197
that's what it's like and they're happy.

1130
00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:47.757
That's what the Hajj is like,

1131
00:36:47.757 --> 00:36:49.464
but a lot, lot, lot, lot, more people

1132
00:36:49.464 --> 00:36:50.725
and they're a lot happier.

1133
00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:51.737
It's beautiful.

1134
00:36:51.737 --> 00:36:53.340
<v Voiceover>Yeah, so celebratory.</v>

1135
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.212
We happened to be in Jerusalem during Hajj

1136
00:36:56.212 --> 00:37:00.847
and such warm, kind, generous people,

1137
00:37:00.847 --> 00:37:03.203
soft and you're right,

1138
00:37:03.203 --> 00:37:05.749
I'm a fan, just like you are.

1139
00:37:07.139 --> 00:37:08.656
So, okay, we've got that,

1140
00:37:08.656 --> 00:37:11.959
now what about some of the other

1141
00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:13.489
most profound and mystical places

1142
00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:15.252
where you've had personal experiences

1143
00:37:15.252 --> 00:37:16.393
around the planet.

1144
00:37:16.393 --> 00:37:18.067
We've kind of gotta move through this quickly

1145
00:37:18.067 --> 00:37:20.488
because we only have an hour together here.

1146
00:37:21.418 --> 00:37:25.016
Just pick your few favorites if you care to share.

1147
00:37:29.967 --> 00:37:32.102
<v ->Well, I like the practice of meditation.</v>

1148
00:37:32.102 --> 00:37:34.739
And to me the practice of meditation

1149
00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:36.673
the techniques are just a quiet,

1150
00:37:36.673 --> 00:37:38.848
this down, a quiet the chatter in the mind down,

1151
00:37:38.848 --> 00:37:41.603
so you can perceive and receive other frequencies

1152
00:37:41.603 --> 00:37:42.748
other teachings.

1153
00:37:42.748 --> 00:37:44.157
Well, I like to go to the places

1154
00:37:44.157 --> 00:37:45.826
where those, there's a greater likelihood

1155
00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:47.989
that those frequencies, those teachings,

1156
00:37:47.989 --> 00:37:50.487
are gonna be sort of like a fountain, almost,

1157
00:37:50.487 --> 00:37:51.595
more available.

1158
00:37:51.595 --> 00:37:54.809
And so these sacred mountains,

1159
00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:57.438
and these places where different saints and sages

1160
00:37:57.438 --> 00:37:59.670
have achieved enlightenment,

1161
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.642
I like to go to those places and just be.

1162
00:38:02.642 --> 00:38:05.080
Just sit there and just be.

1163
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.747
And in some of those places I had these visionary

1164
00:38:07.747 --> 00:38:10.146
experiences that have given me some information,

1165
00:38:10.146 --> 00:38:11.510
some about the past,

1166
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.650
some about the present,

1167
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.379
and some about this interesting thing

1168
00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:17.057
called the next 10 years on the planet.

1169
00:38:17.057 --> 00:38:18.578
So I like those places.

1170
00:38:19.728 --> 00:38:20.911
<v Voiceover>Care to name a few?</v>

1171
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:22.851
Drop a few names there?

1172
00:38:22.851 --> 00:38:25.332
<v ->Well, I guess I could just go back in the,</v>

1173
00:38:25.332 --> 00:38:27.702
sort of a really rough order.

1174
00:38:27.702 --> 00:38:31.137
Easter Island was a major one for me,

1175
00:38:31.137 --> 00:38:35.478
and a place called Izumo-taisha in Japan.

1176
00:38:35.478 --> 00:38:36.643
<v Voiceover>And what is uh--</v>

1177
00:38:36.643 --> 00:38:39.267
<v ->Izumo-taisha is a Shinto shrine in Japan.</v>

1178
00:38:39.267 --> 00:38:42.306
It is a wonderful story, it's written about on my website,

1179
00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:45.242
beautiful story about, or legend about that site.

1180
00:38:45.242 --> 00:38:48.688
But legends are so interesting to me.

1181
00:38:48.688 --> 00:38:51.417
Then coming over to Mexico,

1182
00:38:51.417 --> 00:38:53.694
oh, there's just so many

1183
00:38:53.694 --> 00:38:55.020
but a really important one,

1184
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.961
really, really important one,

1185
00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:58.233
you don't hear much about this one.

1186
00:39:02.243 --> 00:39:06.370
In Yucatán called Labna,

1187
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.804
L-A-B-N-A, Labna, L-A-B-N-A.

1188
00:39:09.804 --> 00:39:12.174
It's a Mayan site.

1189
00:39:12.174 --> 00:39:15.105
And in numerous of the stone rings

1190
00:39:15.105 --> 00:39:18.243
and prereformation pilgrimage cathedrals in Europe,

1191
00:39:18.243 --> 00:39:23.029
Mount Olympus in Greece is extremely important to me.

1192
00:39:24.058 --> 00:39:26.529
Oh gosh, the list is so long,

1193
00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:27.320
the list is so long.

1194
00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.332
If people go to, you know,

1195
00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:31.188
and what's amazing, what's really important

1196
00:39:31.188 --> 00:39:33.701
is not my favorite sites at all,

1197
00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:35.869
what's important and what I've done with this website

1198
00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:38.960
is I feel that the photographs I take have sort of

1199
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.800
what I call the homeopathic essence of the site,

1200
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.606
because of the way I compose the pictures,

1201
00:39:43.606 --> 00:39:45.149
because the choice of the colors,

1202
00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:46.245
because of the time of the day,

1203
00:39:46.245 --> 00:39:47.743
the time of the year and all of that,

1204
00:39:47.743 --> 00:39:49.117
in my own intentionality,

1205
00:39:49.117 --> 00:39:51.884
I've created a photograph that is in a sense

1206
00:39:51.884 --> 00:39:53.610
a magical picture bean,

1207
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.088
so that when people are looking at it,

1208
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:56.586
in a sense, they're there.

1209
00:39:56.586 --> 00:39:59.119
When you're listening to a concerto bait

1210
00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:01.188
by Beethoven, you're in a sense inside of his head.

1211
00:40:01.188 --> 00:40:01.812
You're with him.

1212
00:40:01.812 --> 00:40:02.732
When you're looking at a painting

1213
00:40:02.732 --> 00:40:05.001
by Monet, even if it's in Minneapolis Museum,

1214
00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:06.335
you're standing where Monet stood,

1215
00:40:06.335 --> 00:40:07.665
'cause he stood there when he painted it.

1216
00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:09.269
So when you're looking at one of my photographs,

1217
00:40:09.269 --> 00:40:10.272
you're there.

1218
00:40:10.272 --> 00:40:11.935
But if you feel something,

1219
00:40:11.935 --> 00:40:14.275
if you, and it's not oh, that's really pretty,

1220
00:40:14.275 --> 00:40:15.742
but people feel something,

1221
00:40:15.742 --> 00:40:17.832
and I say that's that place reaching out

1222
00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:19.298
across time and space to you,

1223
00:40:19.298 --> 00:40:20.772
drawing you to it.

1224
00:40:20.772 --> 00:40:21.780
So when people say, well,

1225
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.583
where should I go?

1226
00:40:22.583 --> 00:40:23.950
I go well where do you wanna go?

1227
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.418
They say what do you mean?

1228
00:40:25.418 --> 00:40:26.788
I say is there a certain region of the world

1229
00:40:26.788 --> 00:40:27.680
you've been attracted to?

1230
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.877
And they go, yeah, I've always wanted

1231
00:40:28.877 --> 00:40:29.519
to go to Asia, or I've always wanted

1232
00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:30.891
to go to Latin America.

1233
00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:32.683
I say okay, let's open up the websites,

1234
00:40:32.683 --> 00:40:34.059
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut,

1235
00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:35.877
you look at the pictures from Latin America

1236
00:40:35.877 --> 00:40:37.225
and see which ones touch you.

1237
00:40:37.225 --> 00:40:38.332
Then go there.

1238
00:40:38.332 --> 00:40:39.767
That's the best thing.

1239
00:40:39.767 --> 00:40:40.697
<v Voiceover>That's perfect advice.</v>

1240
00:40:40.697 --> 00:40:41.829
<v ->Yeah, I don't wanna say,</v>

1241
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:43.092
don't go here, go there,

1242
00:40:43.092 --> 00:40:44.293
I wanna say let your soul,

1243
00:40:44.293 --> 00:40:46.371
let psychology, let the relationship you have

1244
00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:47.576
with this living Earth,

1245
00:40:47.576 --> 00:40:49.037
lead you to the most important place

1246
00:40:49.037 --> 00:40:51.143
at this point in your life.

1247
00:40:51.143 --> 00:40:53.422
And Martin Gray doesn't know that.

1248
00:40:55.746 --> 00:40:57.816
<v ->Go to his website by clicking on the link below</v>

1249
00:40:57.816 --> 00:40:59.877
to see his stunning photographs

1250
00:40:59.877 --> 00:41:01.389
and for background on the history

1251
00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:03.676
and lore of each of these sites,

1252
00:41:03.676 --> 00:41:05.518
you will not find a better resource.

1253
00:41:05.518 --> 00:41:08.295
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1254
00:41:08.295 --> 00:41:12.539
