(reflective music)

2
00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:09.352
<v ->Hank Wesselman is one of the most beloved teachers</v>

3
00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:11.732
in the realm of human awakening today.

4
00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:14.692
As an anthropologist with high profile credentials

5
00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:17.523
to his name, Hank's awakening came unexpectedly,

6
00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:20.143
as we detailed in our first interview with him.

7
00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:22.443
Over time his understanding of Shamanism

8
00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:24.733
and it's role amidst the indigenous and now modern

9
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.544
Western cultures of the world, has deepened.

10
00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.624
Because Shamanism is based in experience and practice

11
00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:33.525
rather than belief, he feels it's important for humankind

12
00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:36.385
to acknowledge and embrace this wisdom.

13
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:38.945
His new book, Awakening to the Spirit World,

14
00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:41.485
is one in which he talks about his relationship

15
00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:44.326
with his Hawaiian Kahuna mentor, Hale Makua,

16
00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:49.116
and what he was taught about the spirit world.

17
00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:52.006
<v Regina>The first part of this conversation, Hank,</v>

18
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:53.466
we're going to talk about the book,

19
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.467
Awakening to the Spirit World, and that's one

20
00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:59.487
that you co-authored with Sandra Ingerman.

21
00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.088
<v ->Ingerman, it's true.
<v Regina>Ingerman, yes.</v>

22
00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:03.108
And, I thought we'd go there and then,

23
00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:05.689
you have another book being released, you are prolific,

24
00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.029
another book being released in just a short period of time.

25
00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:10.529
By the time this is out it will have been released

26
00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.009
and I thought we would be able

27
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.100
to do a two-fer in this conversation.

28
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.440
<v ->Good idea.
<v Regina>If you don't mind.</v>

29
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.420
And, one of the things, we're talking about Shamanism,

30
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.541
awakening the Shaman within, so people can stop running

31
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:25.641
to others for their information and start really garnering

32
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.812
it themselves, from their own guiding forces.

33
00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:32.054
<v ->It's true, you know, there's a new form of Shamanism,</v>

34
00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:35.094
which is appearing in our time in the Western world.

35
00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.034
You know, you don't have to live in rain forests

36
00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:41.254
or the desert anymore to practice the Shaman's craft.

37
00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:43.987
There's a new spiritual complex, which is coming into being

38
00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:46.727
in the Western world, and at the core, at the epicenter

39
00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:50.719
of this complex is the awareness that each one of us

40
00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.959
has the ability to have the direct transcendent experience

41
00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.830
of the sacred realms that defines the Shaman, the mystic.

42
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.495
Now, the Shaman, if we were to define the Shaman precisely.

43
00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:06.375
There's a lot of confusion in the Western world

44
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:09.375
about the kind of work which is done by medicine people

45
00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.920
and the kind of work done by Shamans.

46
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.940
This is because every Shaman is a medicine person,

47
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.151
but not all medicine people are Shamans.

48
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:19.961
In fact, in my experience in working with,

49
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:22.832
for example, Native American people at conferences,

50
00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:25.292
most of the medicine people I've met are not Shamans.

51
00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:28.413
but, they fulfill social roles more like priests,

52
00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:31.013
in the sense that they're ceremonial leaders

53
00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:33.053
and many of them have a great deal of knowledge

54
00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.663
about healing using the plant medicines.

55
00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:38.543
In other words, they serve as herbalistic healers.

56
00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:40.953
But, medicine people tend to do their main work here

57
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:45.205
in this world and the Shaman correctly defined,

58
00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:48.425
is an individual who usually discovers early in life,

59
00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:52.825
that they have the ability to dream while they're awake.

60
00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:56.525
Now, dreaming is something that goes on 24 hours a day.

61
00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:59.325
This is something I've heard from the indigenous people

62
00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:01.647
all of my life, that we're actually dreaming 24 hours a day.

63
00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.932
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->It's just that most of us</v>

64
00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:06.232
are so focused on this world and the glitter

65
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:10.252
of our new gadgets that we're not aware of our dreaming.

66
00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:13.682
But, the dream time of the Australian aboriginals

67
00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:15.872
is the source of this world.

68
00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:18.734
Everything that exists in this world, according to them,

69
00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:22.805
was dreamed into existence from this dreamlike realm.

70
00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.427
And, this is the realm in which the Shaman

71
00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:28.467
does their main work, in the dream time.

72
00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.487
So, the Shaman is a person who often discovers early in life

73
00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:34.927
that they have the ability to achieve what we could call

74
00:03:34.927 --> 00:03:38.407
altered states of consciousness while very much awake.

75
00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:41.747
And, in these states of consciousness, they can redirect,

76
00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:46.728
they can re-geography their awareness into the dreaming.

77
00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:48.748
And, the first thing they discover of course,

78
00:03:48.748 --> 00:03:52.748
is that the dream time and the spirit world are the same.

79
00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:56.828
They know this, because the dreaming is inhabited.

80
00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:58.608
Now, it's inhabited by what?

81
00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.419
Well, you could say the spirits of nature,

82
00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.639
the spirits of the animals, the plants, the elementals,

83
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.979
the spirits of discarnate human beings, dead people,

84
00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:12.979
ancestors, as well as the higher organizing intelligences

85
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.151
who are not exactly in charge of this world,

86
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.662
but who are guides and those people we think of

87
00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:21.293
as angels fall into this category.

88
00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.413
And, these beings are real.

89
00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.693
Through relationship with these beings, the Shaman

90
00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:29.244
can do various things, initially on behalf of themselves

91
00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:32.055
and then increasingly on behalf of others, like healing

92
00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:36.216
for example, or accessing information through divination,

93
00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:39.796
or empowering a person who's lost their power, things

94
00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:42.517
like that, these are very useful things to be able to do.

95
00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:46.117
And Shamans, as far as we know, have been doing this

96
00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:48.568
for a very long period of time.

97
00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:49.448
<v ->You know, I've seen
<v Regina>I was reading,</v>

98
00:04:49.448 --> 00:04:52.122
in this book that you have evidence that

99
00:04:52.122 --> 00:04:56.763
Shamanism existed, Northern Iraq, 60,000 years ago

100
00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.423
is one of the mumified examples covered

101
00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.675
in what are considered the (mumbles).

102
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.446
<v ->The Neanderthal burials.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

103
00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:05.237
<v ->Covered with flowers.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

104
00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:09.519
<v ->There are even plaques of red ochre from South Africa</v>

105
00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.559
with inscribed symbols on them that look like grids,

106
00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.589
or webs, or nets, which are 77,000 years old.

107
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:18.560
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.063
<v ->And, any Shaman will take one look at that symbol</v>

109
00:05:21.063 --> 00:05:22.603
and tell you exactly what it means,

110
00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:26.314
because we see these things in our visionary experiences.

111
00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:29.794
So, I got into this because I discovered, quite early on,

112
00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:32.755
that I had this rich inner world, when I was a child,

113
00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:36.035
with these rich friends who, you know, accompanied me

114
00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:39.906
through childhood with childhood imaginary adventures.

115
00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:42.186
I thought of them as imaginary beings.

116
00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.646
It wasn't until I was in my 40's that they decided

117
00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:46.967
to return and take a hand in things.

118
00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:47.778
<v Regina>Yes and we've</v>
<v ->We have.</v>

119
00:05:47.778 --> 00:05:49.301
<v Regina>talked about that about that in past interviews</v>

120
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:52.741
and that was quite a stunning turn of events in your life.

121
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:54.551
<v ->It was.
<v Regina>And, going back to,</v>

122
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:57.633
you were, now this distinction you made, thank you for that,

123
00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:00.213
about the medicine men versus the Shaman.

124
00:06:00.213 --> 00:06:04.024
In this day and age, Shamanism has often been associated

125
00:06:04.024 --> 00:06:08.364
with hallucinogens or mind-altering herbs to take one

126
00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:11.835
into those other realms of contact, for example,

127
00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:14.435
but that is not what it is exclusively.

128
00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:18.835
That is just one element of a shamanic journey.

129
00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:20.326
<v ->Well, it's one element of what I think of</v>

130
00:06:20.326 --> 00:06:22.487
as the technology of transcendence.

131
00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:23.432
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

132
00:06:23.432 --> 00:06:27.512
<v ->You know, the ancestors, we could refer them to the,</v>

133
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.634
as the ancestors in a generic term.

134
00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:32.154
The ancestors worked all this out millenia ago.

135
00:06:32.154 --> 00:06:33.965
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->And, they developed a very</v>

136
00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:37.265
interesting technology which allowed them to build up

137
00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:39.463
their connection with this altered state

138
00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:41.303
and there are many different ways of doing it.

139
00:06:41.303 --> 00:06:42.943
Hallucinogens is just one of them.

140
00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:46.133
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->There are people, you know,</v>

141
00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:47.571
for example like Graham Hancock,

142
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.391
who do most of their work using hallucinogens.

143
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:54.131
I don't use hallucinogens, I discovered that I can use

144
00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:57.189
the drum, I can use the rattle, I can use sonic driving

145
00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.489
to help me achieve certain brain wave states, which will

146
00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:04.189
allow me to achieve this Shamanic state of consciousness.

147
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:06.829
But, dancing, holotropic breathwork.

148
00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:09.169
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->Through the grofs.</v>

149
00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.087
<v Regina>All of it, yeah.</v>
<v ->Singing, meditation.</v>

150
00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:15.807
Shamanic dream work is actually an archaic form

151
00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:19.155
of meditation, which is very powerful.

152
00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:22.295
And, I discovered by talking to a Hawaiian elder

153
00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:25.521
years later, that there are three great pathways

154
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:28.569
into transcendence; meditation is one of them

155
00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.189
and this is what I do with my Shamanic journey work.

156
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.249
The second is tantra.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

157
00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.569
<v ->Sexuality, it's probably the easiest way</v>

158
00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:40.789
to access transcendent states.

159
00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.549
And, the third is suffering
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

160
00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:45.909
<v ->Is suffering, is trauma.
<v Regina>That is true, yes.</v>

161
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.687
<v ->And, if you look at the way the Native Americans</v>

162
00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:49.307
conduct their vision quests, you know,

163
00:07:49.307 --> 00:07:51.545
this plays a great role in achieving

164
00:07:51.545 --> 00:07:53.945
those altered states of consciousness, in which they connect

165
00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:56.115
with their ancestors and their spirits.

166
00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:57.031
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

167
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:58.657
<v ->Fortunately, there are easier ways to do this now.</v>

168
00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:00.555
<v Regina>Well, meditation seems a little more pleasant</v>

169
00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:04.455
in that sense, well and tantra as well, but the suffering,

170
00:08:04.455 --> 00:08:07.833
the pain and the suffering, I understand what you're saying

171
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:10.229
and I think anyone who has been through trauma

172
00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:10.757
<v ->Uh-hu.
<v Regina>and painful</v>

173
00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.847
circumstance understands that it loosens them up

174
00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:15.797
from their every day reality and frame of reference

175
00:08:15.797 --> 00:08:19.253
in order to be able to open to something new.

176
00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:22.893
And however, I agree with you, there has to be easier ways.

177
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:25.033
<v ->Well, biochemically, it also floods the system</v>

178
00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:26.733
with endorphins.
<v Regina>Yes, yes.</v>

179
00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:30.101
<v ->And, this will give you, it's like when people like to jog</v>

180
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:34.001
and they like to exercise, they get this runner's high.

181
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:35.621
It's because their system is being flushed

182
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:37.441
with these endorphins, which allows them

183
00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:40.771
to achieve light trance states, although we don't

184
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.777
really know very much about those in the west,

185
00:08:42.777 --> 00:08:44.437
but that's changing now.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

186
00:08:44.437 --> 00:08:46.637
<v ->And, when Sandra Ingerman invited me to co-author</v>

187
00:08:46.637 --> 00:08:51.077
this book with her, it gave us a real opportunity.

188
00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:56.075
A real opportunity to draw on several of our colleagues,

189
00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:59.195
to pull them into this endeavor to organize the book

190
00:08:59.195 --> 00:09:02.795
around very specific topics and talk about the fact

191
00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:06.263
that there is a kind of Western Shamanism, which has come

192
00:09:06.263 --> 00:09:10.033
into being in our time, a kind of modern Shamanism.

193
00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:13.101
What we've tried to do is we've tried to give it an upgrade

194
00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:15.969
and this is very much in alignment with the understanding

195
00:09:15.969 --> 00:09:18.289
that indigenous people have always had.

196
00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:21.269
They always say that each new generation

197
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.989
has the responsibility to perpetuate and refresh

198
00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:28.849
a continually recreated technique, even adding to and

199
00:09:28.849 --> 00:09:33.849
changing the accumulating treasure of wisdom and knowledge.

200
00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:37.275
Because, it was always this way that this tradition

201
00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:40.535
remained vital and meaningful to those who practiced it.

202
00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:43.495
And, that's what we're doing in the Western world.

203
00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:45.403
You know, Shamanism is actually the birth right

204
00:09:45.403 --> 00:09:48.381
of all human beings everywhere, and the Shaman

205
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:52.221
is a universal figure found in every culture in the world.

206
00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:55.021
In many cultures, such as our own, Shamans

207
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:58.109
and people who practice Shamanism, tend to exist

208
00:09:58.109 --> 00:10:02.017
on the fringes of society, but in many indigenous societies

209
00:10:02.017 --> 00:10:05.297
the Shaman is the most important person in the tribe,

210
00:10:05.297 --> 00:10:08.097
because they're the ones who form the bridge

211
00:10:08.097 --> 00:10:10.760
between the transpersonal worlds of spirit

212
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.360
and the physical world of form and when that bridge

213
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.818
is formed, that's when the magic happens.

214
00:10:16.818 --> 00:10:19.618
And, as all traditional people know, magic is real.

215
00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.486
<v Regina>Yes, magic is real and you and Sandra,</v>

216
00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:24.226
in this book, are saying that this is

217
00:10:24.226 --> 00:10:28.966
essentially our birth right as a being, as a human being.

218
00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:33.786
To be able to access these parts of ourselves and the other

219
00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:35.764
communication with those beyond.

220
00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:39.664
<v ->Well, you know the old prophet and Shaman Black Elk,</v>

221
00:10:39.664 --> 00:10:42.464
not Wallace Black Elk, but the old Nicholas Black Elk,

222
00:10:42.464 --> 00:10:46.004
the man who was the subject of the book, Black Elk Speaks.

223
00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:49.284
He was a boy back in the 1870's when he went

224
00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:53.342
into a deep trance in response to a coma,

225
00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:55.190
when he was about 8 or 9 years old, had this

226
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.750
incredible vision where he was taken into the spirit world.

227
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.110
And, in those days people were still living

228
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.528
like they did in Dances with Wolves.

229
00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:05.888
And, he was shown various things, like the tree of life

230
00:11:05.888 --> 00:11:09.388
and the hoop of nations, and this incredible vision forms

231
00:11:09.388 --> 00:11:11.916
the substance of that book, Black Elk Speaks, which has been

232
00:11:11.916 --> 00:11:15.214
in print since it first came out since the 1930's.

233
00:11:15.214 --> 00:11:17.942
Well, in one of his books, I think it was the second one

234
00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:21.060
called, The Sacred Pipe, he recounts the story of

235
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.108
White Buffalo Woman in gifting the sacred prayer pipe

236
00:11:24.108 --> 00:11:27.508
to the people, and as part of that story he revealed

237
00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:30.574
something very interesting that I wasn't aware of.

238
00:11:30.574 --> 00:11:33.242
He said, when White Buffalo Woman turned to leave

239
00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:36.222
the sacred lodge that had been set up to receive her,

240
00:11:36.222 --> 00:11:39.482
she stopped and she turned and she looked back

241
00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:44.122
and she said, "Remember, in me there are four ages.

242
00:11:44.122 --> 00:11:47.122
"In every age I shall look in on you

243
00:11:47.122 --> 00:11:50.760
"and at the end I shall return."

244
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.441
Now, the Sioux, the Lakota, the Dakota,

245
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:56.472
that complex of plains Indian people, they all believe that

246
00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:59.552
at the beginning of the four ages, a buffalo was placed in

247
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:04.522
the west and the buffalo's job is to hold back the waters.

248
00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:06.114
Now, that's a very interesting thing to say.

249
00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:06.894
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

250
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:07.745
<v ->I mean these people had never seen the ocean.</v>

251
00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:10.357
<v Regina>This was after the age of the floods supposedly.</v>

252
00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:11.998
<v ->This was in the mythic past.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

253
00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:14.598
<v ->This happened, I, thousands of years ago.</v>

254
00:12:14.598 --> 00:12:17.987
<v Regina>Yes, but the lining maybe was geological mystery.</v>

255
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.907
<v ->They'd never seen the ocean.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

256
00:12:19.907 --> 00:12:22.568
<v ->So you know, the buffalo's job is to hold back the water</v>

257
00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:26.068
and they say that in every age, the buffalo loses one leg

258
00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:29.889
and every year it loses one hair and they say that when

259
00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:33.090
all four legs are gone and the buffalo is completely bald,

260
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.100
that the waters are gonna rush in again

261
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.462
and everything's gonna be destroyed.

262
00:12:36.462 --> 00:12:38.682
It's gonna be the end of the cycle of ages and this

263
00:12:38.682 --> 00:12:40.434
is very interesting considering we're coming

264
00:12:40.434 --> 00:12:42.115
to the end of that cycle of ages, you know.

265
00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:43.575
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->And, everybody's concerned</v>

266
00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:47.455
about the sea level rising, you know, this is very serious.

267
00:12:47.455 --> 00:12:50.555
But, on the other side of the planet, it's the Hindus.

268
00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:53.235
For them it's the bull, the sacred cow,

269
00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:55.995
the Dharma, the bull is the Dharma and each one of the legs

270
00:12:55.995 --> 00:12:58.255
is one of the yugas.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

271
00:12:58.255 --> 00:13:02.415
<v ->And, the Hindus and the Sioux are in agreement that both</v>

272
00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:06.695
the bull and the buffalo are now standing on their last leg.

273
00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:10.114
But, this is where the salvation comes in.

274
00:13:10.114 --> 00:13:11.954
Black Elk revealed that with the ending

275
00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:16.184
of this cycle of ages, that the primordial spirituality

276
00:13:16.184 --> 00:13:20.344
would reemerge and reestablish itself and it would be

277
00:13:20.344 --> 00:13:24.824
on this foundation that the next cycle would begin.

278
00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:28.266
Now, this is very interesting because for the last 40 years,

279
00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.445
since Castaneda's books came out and the work

280
00:13:30.445 --> 00:13:34.136
of Michael Hall and others, there's been this incredible

281
00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:37.687
resurgence of the Shaman's methodology.

282
00:13:37.687 --> 00:13:41.306
Shamanism isn't really a religion, it's really a method

283
00:13:41.306 --> 00:13:44.247
for making that transpersonal connection

284
00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:46.377
with the sacred realms and--

285
00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:48.077
<v Regina>Another important distinction.</v>

286
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.957
<v ->It's right at the epicenter.
<v Regina>It's a practice.</v>

287
00:13:49.957 --> 00:13:50.981
<v ->It's right at the center
<v Regina>It's an experience.</v>

288
00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:52.421
of this new spiritual complex

289
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:54.121
that's coming into being.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

290
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:55.841
So, that means you don't need any priest,

291
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:58.641
you don't need any prophet or guru standing

292
00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:02.301
between you and your experience of the sacred realms.

293
00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:05.281
Each person becomes their own priest, their own prophet,

294
00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:07.601
their own guru, receiving their revelations

295
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:09.833
from the higher source as themselves.

296
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:13.633
Which gives these transpersonal forces,

297
00:14:13.633 --> 00:14:16.374
who are willing, they're sort of hovering just off stage

298
00:14:16.374 --> 00:14:20.335
of the human drama, but they're willing to consulate within

299
00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:24.216
and through us, and by doing so they can achieve things

300
00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:26.816
which are truly life-changing.

301
00:14:26.816 --> 00:14:28.356
And, I think this is a very good thing.

302
00:14:28.356 --> 00:14:30.176
<v Regina>I do too, it's exciting and we're seeing</v>

303
00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:32.787
this reflected in popular culture as well

304
00:14:32.787 --> 00:14:36.617
and certainly in entertainment.

305
00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:40.259
We are fascinated with shows like The Medium,

306
00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:44.979
The Mentalist, Ghost Hunters, what is the one,

307
00:14:44.979 --> 00:14:49.200
something with angels, and even Heroes.

308
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.180
We're looking at people that have superhuman abilities,

309
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.900
people that have psychic abilities, when you go to

310
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.781
the movie theater to see anything, the preponderance

311
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.692
of coming attractions have to do with super humans.

312
00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:05.233
Now, a lot of it is fear scenario based.

313
00:15:05.233 --> 00:15:08.513
Talking about invasions from super human types of beings.

314
00:15:08.513 --> 00:15:10.933
<v ->The supernatural.
<v Regina>And supernatural.</v>

315
00:15:10.933 --> 00:15:13.053
And, but none the less, it's showing us

316
00:15:13.053 --> 00:15:16.813
this deep fascination that all of us have.

317
00:15:16.813 --> 00:15:17.184
<v ->Yes.</v>

318
00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:19.684
<v Regina>With this mysterious unknown that has to be</v>

319
00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:22.304
part of us or we wouldn't even have the fascination.

320
00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:24.584
<v ->Yeah, you remember that film they made about The Doors,</v>

321
00:15:24.584 --> 00:15:26.024
about Jim Morrison.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

322
00:15:26.024 --> 00:15:28.904
<v ->There was a real Shamanistic overlay into that film</v>

323
00:15:28.904 --> 00:15:31.424
throughout the entire film, 'cause right at the beginning

324
00:15:31.424 --> 00:15:33.344
as he's a boy, he looks out the window

325
00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:35.524
and he sees this Indian Shaman dying.

326
00:15:35.524 --> 00:15:37.624
And, the Indian Shaman makes contact

327
00:15:37.624 --> 00:15:39.924
with him through the eyes and you had the feeling

328
00:15:39.924 --> 00:15:41.644
that there was a transmission that happened

329
00:15:41.644 --> 00:15:42.924
at that moment.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

330
00:15:42.924 --> 00:15:45.845
<v ->Unfortunately, Jim Morrison hadn't been initiated.</v>

331
00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:48.236
<v ->No, he got a little out of control there.</v>

332
00:15:48.236 --> 00:15:52.087
<v ->And, this is why authentic initiation is so important</v>

333
00:15:52.087 --> 00:15:53.807
and those people, for example,

334
00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:55.787
who come to our training workshops.

335
00:15:55.787 --> 00:15:59.547
You know, we've been doing them for over, almost 20 years.

336
00:15:59.547 --> 00:16:02.418
These are many people who are in search of initiation,

337
00:16:02.418 --> 00:16:04.378
because they didn't get it from their mothers

338
00:16:04.378 --> 00:16:07.018
or their grandmothers or their fathers or grandfathers.

339
00:16:07.018 --> 00:16:08.728
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->You know, they didn't get</v>

340
00:16:08.728 --> 00:16:11.439
authentic initiation and they're still in search of it, even

341
00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:16.439
late in life and so, that's part of what this is all about.

342
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:17.781
<v Regina>And, I think we do need that.</v>

343
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:21.971
We need a how-to guide as a species as we're awakening.

344
00:16:21.971 --> 00:16:25.902
This is what the potential is and as well,

345
00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.623
and these are what some of the challenges

346
00:16:27.623 --> 00:16:30.363
or hazards may be along this journey too.

347
00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:31.143
<v ->It's true.
<v Regina>It's important</v>

348
00:16:31.143 --> 00:16:33.214
to know both.
<v Hank>It's true.</v>

349
00:16:33.214 --> 00:16:35.945
<v Regina>Exactly, otherwise people run into the challenges</v>

350
00:16:35.945 --> 00:16:39.085
and start masking it with drug use or whatever else.

351
00:16:39.085 --> 00:16:40.745
<v ->Well, you know, I used to talk about this</v>

352
00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:42.745
with a kahuna elder and we'll talk about him

353
00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:43.876
in a moment.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

354
00:16:43.876 --> 00:16:46.657
<v ->He was very adamant that in order to experience</v>

355
00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:51.618
authentic initiation, we have to know who we are.

356
00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.898
We have to know who we are as well as where we are.

357
00:16:54.898 --> 00:16:57.679
Those are two very important questions and most of us

358
00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:00.370
here in the Western world are hypnotized by the glitter

359
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.870
of our little toys, our new gadgets.

360
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.710
You know, I sit in airport terminals a lot,

361
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.250
because I travel a lot and you know, I'll be sitting

362
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.582
in some place like the Hawaiian Airlines lounge in Honolulu.

363
00:17:11.582 --> 00:17:14.072
Everybody has got one of these little things

364
00:17:14.072 --> 00:17:16.283
and they're all staring at it and moving their fingers

365
00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:18.124
across the face of this little thing in their hands.

366
00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:20.204
<v Regina>Oh yes, the world brought to you in your palm.</v>

367
00:17:20.204 --> 00:17:22.174
<v ->And, here's the whole world around them</v>

368
00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:25.235
and nobody's paying attention, nobody's paying attention.

369
00:17:25.235 --> 00:17:26.375
<v Regina>That is true.</v>

370
00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:30.076
<v ->You know, so somewhere along the line,</v>

371
00:17:30.076 --> 00:17:32.356
I think it's part of the price we paid

372
00:17:32.356 --> 00:17:36.007
for our Western civilization, somewhere we lost our way.

373
00:17:36.007 --> 00:17:37.907
<v Regina>But, both are happening at the same time.</v>

374
00:17:37.907 --> 00:17:39.287
<v ->Yes they are.
<v Regina>At the same time,</v>

375
00:17:39.287 --> 00:17:41.887
people are in greater and greater numbers by the day.

376
00:17:41.887 --> 00:17:44.268
And we hear, of course as you do, from a lot of people

377
00:17:44.268 --> 00:17:46.729
around the world are beginning to awaken

378
00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:48.789
through whatever their pathway is.

379
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:52.169
And, sometimes it can be through the more challenged

380
00:17:52.169 --> 00:17:54.989
and dark aspects of what's going on.

381
00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:56.209
Sometimes it's through illness.

382
00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:59.709
Sometimes it's by having a divine experience.

383
00:17:59.709 --> 00:18:02.749
And every pathway is legitimate, but it would really be nice

384
00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:06.110
to have a bit of a tour of all of these when we're

385
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.321
coming of age and that's what the culture's missing.

386
00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:11.142
<v ->You remember Joseph Campbell and The Hero's Journey?</v>

387
00:18:11.142 --> 00:18:12.233
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

388
00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:15.293
<v ->You know, once we accept the call, that's the first stage.</v>

389
00:18:15.293 --> 00:18:18.653
The call comes and calls comes in different forms.

390
00:18:18.653 --> 00:18:21.913
You know, the call to adventure, the call to leave the known

391
00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:24.944
and embark on an adventurous quest into the unknown.

392
00:18:24.944 --> 00:18:27.584
That adventurous quest is within yourself,

393
00:18:27.584 --> 00:18:29.524
to find out who you are and what you're doing here,

394
00:18:29.524 --> 00:18:31.204
and what this is all about.

395
00:18:31.204 --> 00:18:34.054
That very first stage you go into is initiation.

396
00:18:34.054 --> 00:18:34.795
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

397
00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:38.027
And, you cannot fake it, you can't get out of it.

398
00:18:38.027 --> 00:18:40.107
There's no getting through, you've gotta get through

399
00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:43.148
this one and you know, this is where people's lives

400
00:18:43.148 --> 00:18:46.188
can unravel in truly spectacular ways in a very

401
00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:47.588
short period of time.
<v Regina>True.</v>

402
00:18:47.588 --> 00:18:49.390
And, a lot of people are going through this right now.

403
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.390
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->This is part of</v>

404
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.146
the great unraveling at the end of this cycle.

405
00:18:54.146 --> 00:18:56.947
So, when you're in the stage of initiation,

406
00:18:56.947 --> 00:19:01.187
it's what my friend the kahuna, Hale Makua, used to call

407
00:19:01.187 --> 00:19:04.008
the school of hard knocks and you know what the lesson

408
00:19:04.008 --> 00:19:06.308
of the school of hard knocks is?

409
00:19:06.308 --> 00:19:11.109
<v Regina>Tell me.</v>
<v ->How to lose gracefully.</v>

410
00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.200
<v Regina>That is true.</v>
<v ->That's the lesson.</v>

411
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.921
And we learn along the way, that when we're in

412
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:21.921
the negative polarity, we never get a successful outcome,

413
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:25.104
you know, but that's where we learn our lessons,

414
00:19:25.104 --> 00:19:27.924
our life lessons, through the negative polarity.

415
00:19:27.924 --> 00:19:32.694
So, the dark has a very strong functional presence

416
00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:36.776
in our lives and that's why people like Robert Bly said,

417
00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.316
"You gotta eat your shadow and have it nourish you."

418
00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:40.468
I never forgot that, he said that back in the 80's.

419
00:19:40.468 --> 00:19:41.908
<v Regina>Yeah, oh that's brilliant.</v>

420
00:19:41.908 --> 00:19:44.408
<v ->Yeah, yeah.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

421
00:19:44.408 --> 00:19:47.970
One of the other, what occurred to me in the book

422
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.530
that we're talking about right now, which is the awakening

423
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.320
of the Shamanic aspect of ourselves, is that

424
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.311
as you find your way along this journey,

425
00:19:58.311 --> 00:20:02.091
there comes a point at which, at least for me what occurred,

426
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:06.271
was I was no longer clear as to whether I was speaking

427
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:10.062
with an outside influence or really by this time had

428
00:20:10.062 --> 00:20:14.303
just begun connecting with my own true self, my own essence.

429
00:20:14.303 --> 00:20:17.013
<v Hank>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->And, how does that,</v>

430
00:20:17.013 --> 00:20:19.804
where and how does that differentiation come

431
00:20:19.804 --> 00:20:22.484
in the Shamanic journey?

432
00:20:22.484 --> 00:20:26.604
<v ->Well, this pulls us towards the subject of my new book,</v>

433
00:20:26.604 --> 00:20:28.925
The Bowl of Light, which is about the Hawaiian elder.

434
00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:31.206
<v Regina>Let's go there.</v>
<v ->Well, they're kind of like</v>

435
00:20:31.206 --> 00:20:34.677
Socratic dialogues if I could be completely humble.

436
00:20:34.677 --> 00:20:36.830
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->You know, this man and I,</v>

437
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.490
we came into relationship in 1996 and through

438
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.631
this relationship we had a series of dialogues over

439
00:20:43.631 --> 00:20:47.662
an eight year period, which were absolutely mind blowing.

440
00:20:47.662 --> 00:20:51.222
And, I've brought a lot of his shared wisdom into this book,

441
00:20:51.222 --> 00:20:54.562
The Bowl of Light, with his permission that he gave me

442
00:20:54.562 --> 00:20:56.802
the night before he passed.

443
00:20:56.802 --> 00:20:58.782
None of us knew he was gonna pass.

444
00:20:58.782 --> 00:21:00.793
He spent the last week of his life with Jill and I

445
00:21:00.793 --> 00:21:04.753
and a group in Hawaii and we did ceremony for the last time

446
00:21:04.753 --> 00:21:08.114
on the 26th of March and the next day

447
00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:10.384
he was killed in a car accident.

448
00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.776
<v Regina>And, he has given you permission just by</v>

449
00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:15.316
<v ->He'd encouraged me to bring this knowledge</v>

450
00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:18.496
to the wider world, because in coming to our gatherings

451
00:21:18.496 --> 00:21:23.496
in Hawaii, Makua was very good at sharing his knowledge,

452
00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:27.217
sharing his stories, but what he saw my wife and I doing is

453
00:21:27.217 --> 00:21:31.497
he saw us training these western people to achieve trance,

454
00:21:31.497 --> 00:21:34.267
to achieve that connection with the sacred realms

455
00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:36.479
and he really didn't know how to do that,

456
00:21:36.479 --> 00:21:39.079
how to train people to do what he did.

457
00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:42.550
This was a man who was in constant touch with his ancestors.

458
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.210
I should say something about how we met,

459
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.211
because it's a very interesting story.

460
00:21:45.211 --> 00:21:47.342
<v Regina>And about his background a little bit</v>

461
00:21:47.342 --> 00:21:48.922
and how others perceived him.

462
00:21:48.922 --> 00:21:50.853
<v ->Well, I knew about this guy for years,</v>

463
00:21:50.853 --> 00:21:54.174
but I'd never met him, Hale Makua was a seventh generation

464
00:21:54.174 --> 00:21:59.174
direct descendant of King Kamehameha and his third wife.

465
00:21:59.224 --> 00:22:01.697
That was his mother's side, on his father's side

466
00:22:01.697 --> 00:22:05.477
he was a seventh generation descendant of High Chief Kaoua

467
00:22:05.477 --> 00:22:08.758
of Kau on the Big Island as well.

468
00:22:08.758 --> 00:22:12.018
So, he was known all over Polynesia.

469
00:22:12.018 --> 00:22:14.198
I wouldn't go so far as to call him the Dalai Lama,

470
00:22:14.198 --> 00:22:18.148
but everyone in Polynesia knew him.

471
00:22:18.148 --> 00:22:20.519
In his native Hawaii he kept a very low profile,

472
00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:23.679
because of a very humble guy.

473
00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:28.210
But, in 1996 I was invited to give a talk at an institute

474
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.570
in Hawaii and I'm just about to launch into my talk

475
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.333
and this big Hawaiian man comes through the door.

476
00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:38.033
Now, this guy was a head taller than me, outweighed me

477
00:22:38.033 --> 00:22:42.144
by 100 pounds, great big white pony tail down his back,

478
00:22:42.144 --> 00:22:45.426
huge white beard down his chest, big walking stick

479
00:22:45.426 --> 00:22:50.426
in front of him, elaborately carved, flashy aloha shirt

480
00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:52.608
and he's got a couple of leis around his neck.

481
00:22:52.608 --> 00:22:55.202
So, he comes in with a big laugh and he puts a lei

482
00:22:55.202 --> 00:22:58.583
around my neck and a lei around my wife, Jill's neck.

483
00:22:58.583 --> 00:23:00.834
And, this is how we met Hale Makua.

484
00:23:00.834 --> 00:23:03.334
He'd come to look me over.
<v Regina>Grand entrance.</v>

485
00:23:03.334 --> 00:23:06.134
<v ->Now, he had read my first book, Spirit Walker,</v>

486
00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:08.934
which many of your listeners know, your watchers know,

487
00:23:08.934 --> 00:23:12.716
is about my transpersonal journeys into the future

488
00:23:12.716 --> 00:23:15.156
and my connection with my descendant self.

489
00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:17.217
Now, this hinges on the question you've asked me,

490
00:23:17.217 --> 00:23:20.208
because I didn't know it at the beginning, but what I

491
00:23:20.208 --> 00:23:23.820
was doing was achieving connection with my higher self.

492
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.660
And, this man who lives in the future is a future self,

493
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.280
a future me, and the higher self is Grand Central Station.

494
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.841
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->So, Makua knew this, because</v>

495
00:23:33.841 --> 00:23:37.041
he'd read my book and he'd come in to have a look at me.

496
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:40.121
Well, you know, one's mind can work exceedingly fast

497
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:41.601
under these circumstances.

498
00:23:41.601 --> 00:23:44.092
Here's the big, this wasn't just any kahuna, this was

499
00:23:44.092 --> 00:23:47.163
the big kahuna.
<v Regina>The big kahuna.</v>

500
00:23:47.163 --> 00:23:50.863
<v ->So, he comes in and sits down and I launch into my talk</v>

501
00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:54.304
about the transformational community, about who we are,

502
00:23:54.304 --> 00:23:58.124
who all of your speakers are on your wonderful tapes,

503
00:23:58.124 --> 00:24:03.124
you know, and he followed me, he followed what I was saying.

504
00:24:03.204 --> 00:24:05.304
And, I spoke for about an hour and a half about the beliefs

505
00:24:05.304 --> 00:24:08.225
and values and trends that Western people who are involved

506
00:24:08.225 --> 00:24:11.536
in the transformational movement hold dear.

507
00:24:11.536 --> 00:24:13.616
And, at the end of that time I got this feeling like

508
00:24:13.616 --> 00:24:16.077
there was something that he wanted to say.

509
00:24:16.077 --> 00:24:18.417
And so, I turned and I looked to him.

510
00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:21.257
I didn't know what the protocol was, and he's sitting there

511
00:24:21.257 --> 00:24:25.747
watching me across the room and I said, Elder Makua

512
00:24:25.747 --> 00:24:27.508
I don't know what the protocol is, but I'm getting

513
00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:31.048
this feeling that there's something you'd like to say.

514
00:24:31.048 --> 00:24:32.938
Now, this was a man who traveled

515
00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:36.729
with generations of his ancestors in spirit,

516
00:24:36.729 --> 00:24:40.789
in constant attendance upon him as advisors.

517
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:44.789
And so, he smiled at me then he kind of leaned over one way

518
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:46.809
as though somebody was speaking in his ear.

519
00:24:46.809 --> 00:24:48.469
Then, you kind of leaned the other way

520
00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:50.669
as though somebody's speaking in this ear.

521
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:53.809
Then he smiled and he stood up

522
00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:56.629
and when this man stood up, he was impressive.

523
00:24:56.629 --> 00:24:59.269
He looked at me across the room and he said,

524
00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:04.249
"A friend of mine sent me your book and I read it."

525
00:25:04.749 --> 00:25:08.650
Silence in the room, I mean this was the moment of truth.

526
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.070
He said, "I read it again just to make sure I got it right

527
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.001
"and then, I went down to the beach and I put your book down

528
00:25:13.001 --> 00:25:15.592
"in the sand and I called in the ancestors

529
00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:18.904
"and we had a talk about you."

530
00:25:18.904 --> 00:25:20.705
Now, I'm standing there, you know.

531
00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:21.575
(laughter)

532
00:25:21.575 --> 00:25:23.876
I'm really, I'm pretty nervous, you know.

533
00:25:23.876 --> 00:25:25.476
I mean, you know, for starters I knew--

534
00:25:25.476 --> 00:25:27.157
<v Regina>Yeah, what did they tell him about you.</v>

535
00:25:27.157 --> 00:25:28.777
<v ->Well, indigenous people don't like it</v>

536
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:31.397
when outsiders trespass into their spiritual traditions.

537
00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:32.457
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->And, my first book,</v>

538
00:25:32.457 --> 00:25:34.638
Spirit Walker, had a lot of indigenous wisdom

539
00:25:34.638 --> 00:25:36.590
from Hawaii in the book.
<v Regina>Yes, I recall.</v>

540
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.680
Spiritual wisdom.

541
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.242
Now, I didn't know it, but Makua's clairvoyant and

542
00:25:42.242 --> 00:25:43.753
he's following everything that's going

543
00:25:43.753 --> 00:25:46.073
through my mind as I'm thinking it.

544
00:25:46.073 --> 00:25:48.063
And, he suddenly looked at me and he laughed and said,

545
00:25:48.063 --> 00:25:50.965
"Don't worry, we Hawaiians don't write, we talk."

546
00:25:50.965 --> 00:25:52.705
<v Regina>We talk.</v>
<v ->"And we share what we find</v>

547
00:25:52.705 --> 00:25:54.626
"in our heart with each other.

548
00:25:54.626 --> 00:25:56.826
"But, in your culture it's the tradition to write,

549
00:25:56.826 --> 00:25:59.366
"so the ancestors have told me to say to you,

550
00:25:59.366 --> 00:26:01.147
"in front of all these people here that,

551
00:26:01.147 --> 00:26:04.027
"everything you wrote in your book is true

552
00:26:04.027 --> 00:26:06.788
"and we Hawaiians need to support you.

553
00:26:06.788 --> 00:26:10.608
"Keep spreading the words, you're making my job easier."

554
00:26:10.608 --> 00:26:12.349
<v Regina>And, it's interesting it was that book,</v>

555
00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:15.229
because that book which I encourage people to read,

556
00:26:15.229 --> 00:26:19.029
is quite a fascinating portrait of us in the future.

557
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:21.889
<v ->It is, I'm still getting emails from it 15 years later.</v>

558
00:26:21.889 --> 00:26:22.969
I mean, people are still reading it.

559
00:26:22.969 --> 00:26:24.249
<v Regina>Well and maybe people are just now</v>

560
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.030
embracing the fact things are changing and we might have a

561
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.310
very, very different looking world in the future,

562
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.150
than (clears throat) what we believe at this point in time

563
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.431
and this details it, your book details it.

564
00:26:35.431 --> 00:26:37.353
<v ->Well, you know, one of the uncanny things for me,</v>

565
00:26:37.353 --> 00:26:40.533
and I have no eagle investment in this, is virtually all

566
00:26:40.533 --> 00:26:44.145
of the predictions that I made in that book have come true

567
00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:46.245
and just as fast as I said they would.

568
00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:49.315
We're talking about climate warming.

569
00:26:49.315 --> 00:26:51.247
Anyway, this was the beginning of a most interesting

570
00:26:51.247 --> 00:26:53.567
friendship and Makua looked at me and said,

571
00:26:53.567 --> 00:26:56.627
"We should have a meeting before you leave the island."

572
00:26:56.627 --> 00:27:00.447
Now, when the big kahuna says you're gonna have a meeting.

573
00:27:00.447 --> 00:27:03.507
We had our meeting right on the edge of Kilauea volcano.

574
00:27:03.507 --> 00:27:05.958
Right at the edge of the crater and he chanted

575
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:08.478
and he called all of his ancestors to come.

576
00:27:08.478 --> 00:27:11.359
That's when I realized that Makua was a Shaman, because

577
00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:15.400
I watched him transform physically in front of my eyes.

578
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.540
He was using his mind and his body as a bridge

579
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.700
to bring his ancestors through from the realm of spirit

580
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.620
into the realm of form so they could witness

581
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.020
the conversation we had that afternoon

582
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.680
and that's when we got to know each other.

583
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.640
It was very interesting because at the end of the afternoon

584
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.740
Jill and I were just sitting, just kind of

585
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.071
in an altered state listening to this man.

586
00:27:37.071 --> 00:27:39.651
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->This is all in the book</v>

587
00:27:39.651 --> 00:27:42.291
by the way, everything we talked about.

588
00:27:42.291 --> 00:27:44.291
And, he looked at me and he said,

589
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:46.071
"I have a gift I want to give you."

590
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:47.872
And, he went over to his truck and he brought

591
00:27:47.872 --> 00:27:52.692
this leafy bundle, which in Hawaii is called a pu'olo.

592
00:27:52.692 --> 00:27:56.272
You whack the top off a tea plant and you pull the leaves up

593
00:27:56.272 --> 00:27:58.252
to the stem and you tie them and it creates

594
00:27:58.252 --> 00:28:02.632
this sort of bundle of leaves, and it was a big one.

595
00:28:02.632 --> 00:28:04.312
So, you know, Jill and I are looking at

596
00:28:04.312 --> 00:28:07.055
this traditional gift that he is giving us

597
00:28:07.055 --> 00:28:11.675
and we opened it up and inside this bundle was a bowl.

598
00:28:11.675 --> 00:28:15.225
A very simple, wooden Hawaiian bowl.

599
00:28:15.225 --> 00:28:16.787
And, he looked at us and he said,

600
00:28:16.787 --> 00:28:19.487
"This is your bowl of light."

601
00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:22.948
He said, "Before we come into life, our oversoul,

602
00:28:22.948 --> 00:28:26.789
"our higher self, what the Hawaiians call, aumakua,

603
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:30.869
"divides itself and it sends in a bowl of it's light,

604
00:28:30.869 --> 00:28:32.990
"which takes up residence within us when we take

605
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.941
"our first breath, and then that light resides within us

606
00:28:36.941 --> 00:28:40.531
"throughout our entire life, nourishing us and sustaining us

607
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:43.182
"as well as connecting us to the higher self."

608
00:28:43.182 --> 00:28:47.202
It's kind of like an open mic, it's a little uncanny,

609
00:28:47.202 --> 00:28:51.813
because it reveals that privacy is truly an illusion.

610
00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:55.553
We're actually being monitored 24/7 by the higher self

611
00:28:55.553 --> 00:28:57.020
that lives upstairs.
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

612
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.357
And, I'm aware of that, sometimes I just have to laugh.

613
00:28:59.357 --> 00:29:02.036
<v ->See, this comes now to the question you asked me.</v>

614
00:29:02.036 --> 00:29:05.516
So, he said to me, "You know, as we pass through life

615
00:29:05.516 --> 00:29:08.756
"we step into the negative polarity and whenever we do

616
00:29:08.756 --> 00:29:10.676
"it's like you put a stone in your bowl

617
00:29:10.676 --> 00:29:13.356
"and some of your light goes out."

618
00:29:13.356 --> 00:29:15.756
He said, "Slowly but surely a bowl of light begins

619
00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:17.596
"to fill up with stones until there's almost

620
00:29:17.596 --> 00:29:19.976
"no light coming out of it anymore."

621
00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:22.436
And, as an aside, I remember him saying on that day,

622
00:29:22.436 --> 00:29:25.146
he said, "You know, the main problem in the world today

623
00:29:25.146 --> 00:29:28.288
"is that the world is being run by men who's bowls of light

624
00:29:28.288 --> 00:29:31.528
"are filled with stones, they're dark warriors,

625
00:29:31.528 --> 00:29:33.288
"there's no light in them anymore."

626
00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:35.508
Although they would deny it, and that includes

627
00:29:35.508 --> 00:29:38.558
our religious leadership as well I might add.

628
00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:41.370
And so he said, "Hopefully we find out

629
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.390
"what we're doing before it's too late."

630
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.890
And he said, "Do you know what you do then?"

631
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.930
And, of course Jill and I are hanging on every word.

632
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.001
I said, what, he said, "It's simple, you take the bowl."

633
00:29:50.001 --> 00:29:52.501
And, he took this wooden bowl and he turned it over.

634
00:29:52.501 --> 00:29:54.052
He said, "You just dump it out."

635
00:29:54.052 --> 00:29:57.092
And, with this big laugh, he loved to laugh.

636
00:29:57.092 --> 00:29:58.972
And he said, "But then you start to live your life

637
00:29:58.972 --> 00:30:01.232
"differently from that time forward.

638
00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:04.274
"That's when you've become a spiritual warrior."

639
00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:06.014
And, he used the word warrior with deliberation,

640
00:30:06.014 --> 00:30:09.494
because he was a military warrior, he was in five wars.

641
00:30:09.494 --> 00:30:12.254
The first was Beirut, the last was Vietnam,

642
00:30:12.254 --> 00:30:15.196
where he was severely wounded through his legs and feet.

643
00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:19.456
He was in the Marines, so he loved the warrior's life

644
00:30:19.456 --> 00:30:22.416
and he was a spiritual warrior and he said, "Since you've

645
00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:24.996
"come to that place, I can now give you

646
00:30:24.996 --> 00:30:29.259
"the three kapus of the spiritual warrior."

647
00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:31.779
The three directives, these are sacred directives.

648
00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:34.279
They're also like restrictions, because once you're

649
00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.779
on the path, the path that we walk on is narrow

650
00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:40.929
and it's constrained by these directives.

651
00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:44.231
So, I'm bracing myself and he says, "The first one is this,

652
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:49.211
"you must love all that you see with humility."

653
00:30:50.062 --> 00:30:53.082
And, I'm thinking to myself, Jesus easy one first.

654
00:30:53.082 --> 00:30:55.702
And of course, he's picking this up 'cause he's clairvoyant.

655
00:30:55.702 --> 00:30:57.642
He laughed and he said, "I worked on that one

656
00:30:57.642 --> 00:31:01.873
"for seven years, love all that you see with humility."

657
00:31:01.873 --> 00:31:04.973
Because, when you come from that place of humility,

658
00:31:04.973 --> 00:31:07.453
you connect with the energy of aloha.

659
00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:08.794
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->And, that's what makes</v>

660
00:31:08.794 --> 00:31:10.755
everything possible, you cannot connect

661
00:31:10.755 --> 00:31:13.555
with your spirits or your ancestors unless you're

662
00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:16.926
in the state of aloha, that's the key.

663
00:31:16.926 --> 00:31:21.856
Number two, we have to live all that we feel with reverence.

664
00:31:23.706 --> 00:31:28.127
With reverence, and as reverence refers to respect.

665
00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:30.047
And, as you know, indigenous people have

666
00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:32.407
this ritual comprehension of respect,

667
00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:33.988
which eludes us Westerners.

668
00:31:33.988 --> 00:31:36.308
That's because for indigenous people,

669
00:31:36.308 --> 00:31:39.909
the foundation stone for indigenous mind is respect.

670
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:42.909
<v Regina>Uh-hu, it is not so in west.</v>

671
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:45.389
<v ->In the Western world, the foundation stone</v>

672
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:49.529
for western mind, which is the same as colonial mind,

673
00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:53.500
is dominion, is domination, and it's brought us

674
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.760
to the world that we're in right now, which

675
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.500
as we all know, is troubled, you know, things are unraveling

676
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.762
and rather rapidly, end of the cycle.

677
00:32:02.762 --> 00:32:07.334
The third kapu, we must know what we possess

678
00:32:07.334 --> 00:32:12.314
with discipline, and that includes what possesses us.

679
00:32:12.594 --> 00:32:14.915
See, this is where we find our self-discipline.

680
00:32:14.915 --> 00:32:16.895
And, as spiritual warriors, those people who

681
00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:19.655
are spiritual seekers, who are on the path, who are on

682
00:32:19.655 --> 00:32:23.776
the red road, you have to do it from a place of discipline.

683
00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:27.676
You cannot, if you lose your discipline, you lose your way.

684
00:32:27.676 --> 00:32:30.896
And, this is where so many of the gurus have stumbled

685
00:32:30.896 --> 00:32:33.376
and seekers as well.

686
00:32:33.376 --> 00:32:37.347
So, this is really our path to love with humility,

687
00:32:37.347 --> 00:32:42.347
to live with reverence, and to know with self-discipline.

688
00:32:42.487 --> 00:32:44.417
This is how this book, The Bowl of Light, begins.

689
00:32:44.417 --> 00:32:45.069
<v Regina>Oh, that's how it begins.</v>

690
00:32:45.069 --> 00:32:45.831
<v ->That was the beginning of our friendship.</v>

691
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:47.912
<v Regina>Well, can you give take us a little further,</v>

692
00:32:47.912 --> 00:32:50.644
tease us a bit more into the book?

693
00:32:50.644 --> 00:32:52.994
<v ->Well, over the years.
<v Regina>A few of the things</v>

694
00:32:52.994 --> 00:32:55.765
that really jump out that would be wonderful to share.

695
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:57.605
I mean, when the book comes out we can all

696
00:32:57.605 --> 00:32:59.557
take a look at it and learn the rest for ourselves,

697
00:32:59.557 --> 00:33:02.177
but I'd like to know a few of the juicy bits.

698
00:33:02.177 --> 00:33:05.397
<v ->Well, there's a long chapter on the ancestral mysteries,</v>

699
00:33:05.397 --> 00:33:08.138
which is virtually verbatim from him.

700
00:33:08.138 --> 00:33:10.498
He talked about the fact that the ancestors

701
00:33:10.498 --> 00:33:14.018
set a plan into motion in the mythic past,

702
00:33:14.018 --> 00:33:16.978
which is working itself out now in our world.

703
00:33:16.978 --> 00:33:19.318
A lot of us are totally unaware of this.

704
00:33:19.318 --> 00:33:21.889
<v Regina>But, we are our ancestors.</v>

705
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:24.349
<v ->We are our own ancestors, of course.</v>

706
00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:26.449
So, we have a stake in the action don't we?

707
00:33:26.449 --> 00:33:28.921
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah, our higher self.</v>

708
00:33:28.921 --> 00:33:31.841
You know, I think of the higher self, my higher self,

709
00:33:31.841 --> 00:33:34.261
when I perceive it in my moments of vision,

710
00:33:34.261 --> 00:33:37.401
I don't perceive it as an angelic being with wings.

711
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:42.401
I perceive this basket made of light, with strands of light.

712
00:33:42.661 --> 00:33:43.781
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->And it's organized</v>

713
00:33:43.781 --> 00:33:47.292
very much like a taurus or a doughnut with a shaft of light

714
00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:49.692
that goes right down the middle, which is where the hole

715
00:33:49.692 --> 00:33:52.613
in a doughnut is, and then all the way around.

716
00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:55.193
It's like slinky, alright, remember the slinky?

717
00:33:55.193 --> 00:33:57.023
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->With all these rings</v>

718
00:33:57.023 --> 00:33:58.384
that go all the way around.
<v Regina>I do.</v>

719
00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:00.304
<v ->Well each one of those circles in a slinky</v>

720
00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:03.744
is like a DVD of your former lives,

721
00:34:03.744 --> 00:34:06.324
your former selves and they're all in there.

722
00:34:06.324 --> 00:34:09.064
And, we can draw on this ancestral wisdom,

723
00:34:09.064 --> 00:34:12.604
because we carry it within us through that probe,

724
00:34:12.604 --> 00:34:14.984
that seed of light, which was seeded in us,

725
00:34:14.984 --> 00:34:18.204
which we carry until we release our breath at life's end.

726
00:34:18.204 --> 00:34:20.924
And then, it goes back to it's source, but it's changed.

727
00:34:20.924 --> 00:34:23.384
Everything that we've done and become during life.

728
00:34:23.384 --> 00:34:25.824
But, he talked about the ancestral mysteries

729
00:34:25.824 --> 00:34:30.794
and he talked about the fact that the ancestors are

730
00:34:30.794 --> 00:34:35.736
as he put it, they are releasing information now to us,

731
00:34:36.726 --> 00:34:39.698
because the world is ready to receive it

732
00:34:39.698 --> 00:34:42.218
and it's taking a very specific form

733
00:34:42.218 --> 00:34:45.200
in what he called the ancestral grand plan.

734
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.671
And, there's a chapter called the Ancestral Grand Plan.

735
00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:52.631
He said, the plan is as much of the divine

736
00:34:52.631 --> 00:34:55.384
that we can understand at any one time

737
00:34:55.384 --> 00:34:58.364
in our passage across eternity.

738
00:34:58.364 --> 00:35:02.324
He said, initially it has to involve those elements

739
00:35:02.324 --> 00:35:07.315
that will enable the expansion of humankind's consciousness.

740
00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:10.406
And at all levels, see that's the work that you're doing.

741
00:35:10.406 --> 00:35:13.326
<v Regina>That's what we're all doing here together, yes.</v>

742
00:35:13.326 --> 00:35:14.548
<v ->That's what you're putting out there.</v>

743
00:35:14.548 --> 00:35:16.288
You've created this incredible resource

744
00:35:16.288 --> 00:35:18.708
with the Conscious Media Network, to allow people

745
00:35:18.708 --> 00:35:22.719
to tap in to the great teachers of our time.

746
00:35:22.719 --> 00:35:26.139
The expansion of consciousness of humankind.

747
00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:29.139
He also said that there are certain conditions

748
00:35:29.139 --> 00:35:32.581
that need to be in place before we're ready to step up

749
00:35:32.581 --> 00:35:36.361
and into this spiritual heirarchy and he described

750
00:35:36.361 --> 00:35:39.401
what this spiritual hierarchy is like and although

751
00:35:39.401 --> 00:35:42.192
we don't like to think of the word heirarchy, because we're

752
00:35:42.192 --> 00:35:46.572
democratic people in America, fact is there is a hierarchy

753
00:35:46.572 --> 00:35:50.032
and we're all involved in it at different levels.

754
00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:52.992
And so, he talked about the stages of the plan,

755
00:35:52.992 --> 00:35:56.652
you know, those stages which are political in nature,

756
00:35:56.652 --> 00:35:59.152
those which are spiritual in nature,

757
00:35:59.152 --> 00:36:01.512
those which are scientific in nature,

758
00:36:01.512 --> 00:36:05.272
and how each one of us finds our way into that niche

759
00:36:05.272 --> 00:36:09.453
within the plan in which we can make major contributions.

760
00:36:09.453 --> 00:36:13.173
So initially, the expansion of humankind's consciousness

761
00:36:13.173 --> 00:36:16.473
and then secondly, becoming self-aware of who we are

762
00:36:16.473 --> 00:36:20.093
and what we're actually involved in.

763
00:36:20.093 --> 00:36:22.334
So, this is a very interesting chapter.

764
00:36:22.334 --> 00:36:23.376
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->I don't know if anything</v>

765
00:36:23.376 --> 00:36:25.948
has ever been written like this quite before.

766
00:36:25.948 --> 00:36:30.338
That conversation took place in a hotel diningroom.

767
00:36:30.338 --> 00:36:32.539
The Kailua Beach Hotel on the Kona Coast.

768
00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:36.160
We were having margaritas and feasting from the buffet

769
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.980
and it was a very wonderful talk, I mean the book

770
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.200
is sprinkled with these talks.

771
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.160
He talked about the Star People as well.

772
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.196
<v Regina>And, let's talk about that.</v>

773
00:36:44.196 --> 00:36:46.316
That's a big subject right now.

774
00:36:46.316 --> 00:36:49.336
<v ->Big subject, he said, you know, he asked me</v>

775
00:36:49.336 --> 00:36:51.856
about the work I do as an anthropologist and I told him

776
00:36:51.856 --> 00:36:55.396
about the paleontology I do in East Africa, working with

777
00:36:55.396 --> 00:36:58.736
the bones of the ancestors, digging up early man.

778
00:36:58.736 --> 00:37:01.756
Ardipithecus, alright, it was a National Geographic

779
00:37:01.756 --> 00:37:05.158
cover story in July in 2010, I was an excavator

780
00:37:05.158 --> 00:37:07.856
on that site for the four million year old woman.

781
00:37:07.856 --> 00:37:11.356
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And, she is probably a link</v>

782
00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:15.408
between us and our ancestral ape selves, alright.

783
00:37:15.408 --> 00:37:16.688
People might not like that, but

784
00:37:16.688 --> 00:37:18.489
we have evidence for this now.

785
00:37:18.489 --> 00:37:20.129
So, I was working with the ancestors

786
00:37:20.129 --> 00:37:22.969
and this was part of the link betwen Makua and myself.

787
00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:26.669
He realized that the ancestors had called me back

788
00:37:26.669 --> 00:37:29.529
into the past millions of years ago and that they

789
00:37:29.529 --> 00:37:33.400
were affecting me and he worked with the ancestors as well.

790
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.360
In talking about my work in human evolution he said,

791
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.380
"You know, we Polynesians have a different kind of story.

792
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.960
"We understand that humanity actually came from out there."

793
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.100
And he pointed upwards, he said, "Humanity actually came

794
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.300
"from the stars, we didn't come as aliens,

795
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.160
"we didn't come in spaceships, we came as souls,

796
00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.220
"as seeds of light and we came in celestial canoes,

797
00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.951
"which were made of light."

798
00:37:59.951 --> 00:38:01.871
And then as an aside he would say, "You know,

799
00:38:01.871 --> 00:38:03.711
"I remember what my seat number was.

800
00:38:03.711 --> 00:38:05.231
"I remember who was on my right, on my left,

801
00:38:05.231 --> 00:38:09.051
"above me, and below me, I remember, I remember that."

802
00:38:09.051 --> 00:38:11.231
He said, "We were brought out of another dimension

803
00:38:11.231 --> 00:38:14.952
"and across the universe and we came here to this planet.

804
00:38:14.952 --> 00:38:17.612
"We were brought here by high guardians,

805
00:38:17.612 --> 00:38:20.652
"high spiritual guardians who knew our purpose

806
00:38:20.652 --> 00:38:22.372
"and our destiny.

807
00:38:22.372 --> 00:38:25.212
"They brought us here because there were beings

808
00:38:25.212 --> 00:38:28.332
"who were ready to receive us."

809
00:38:28.332 --> 00:38:31.612
<v Regina>So interesting.</v>
<v ->Alright, now I'm.</v>

810
00:38:31.612 --> 00:38:34.235
Years later he talked about the fact when you get back to

811
00:38:34.235 --> 00:38:37.695
18 and a half million years ago, that's when you'll find me,

812
00:38:37.695 --> 00:38:40.347
when I told him I was working at about four to six million.

813
00:38:40.347 --> 00:38:42.287
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->Now, 18 and a half million</v>

814
00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:46.288
years ago is a period of time called the early Miocene.

815
00:38:46.288 --> 00:38:49.058
I know from my paleo work, Makua didn't know this,

816
00:38:49.058 --> 00:38:52.879
but I know that at that time, it was a greenhouse world.

817
00:38:52.879 --> 00:38:54.679
There were no ice at the poles.

818
00:38:54.679 --> 00:38:57.759
There were huge tropical forests that blanketed the earth,

819
00:38:57.759 --> 00:38:59.819
all the way up to the arctic circle.

820
00:38:59.819 --> 00:39:01.319
And, in these tropical forests there was

821
00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:05.270
this very interesting early kind of anthropoid ape,

822
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.350
which we know in science as the dryopithecines.

823
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.710
Now, they looked actually more like monkeys,

824
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.950
but they lacked tails, and you'll notice

825
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.950
when you're in the dining room or wherever, nobody in there

826
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.542
is sporting a tail, at least none that we can see.

827
00:39:20.542 --> 00:39:24.522
Alright, and so this was the vehicle.

828
00:39:24.522 --> 00:39:27.843
These are the earliest apes and these apes diversified

829
00:39:27.843 --> 00:39:30.103
across that period of time called the Miocene

830
00:39:30.103 --> 00:39:34.223
and it was from that ancestral stock, this physical body,

831
00:39:34.223 --> 00:39:37.024
that humanity eventually branched off

832
00:39:37.024 --> 00:39:39.584
probably around six million years ago.

833
00:39:39.584 --> 00:39:41.324
So, here was the ancestral stock.

834
00:39:41.324 --> 00:39:44.124
Now, I'm thinking to myself, Makua couldn't know this.

835
00:39:44.124 --> 00:39:45.055
You know, how did he know this,

836
00:39:45.055 --> 00:39:47.155
he was just right on the mark.

837
00:39:47.155 --> 00:39:50.855
And then he told me, "The guardians who brought us

838
00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.835
"embodied as well, so that they would be here

839
00:39:53.835 --> 00:39:56.237
"when we were ready to receive our knowledge

840
00:39:56.237 --> 00:39:58.997
"of our purpose and our destiny."

841
00:39:58.997 --> 00:40:01.900
So, he's watching me to see if I'll figure it out.

842
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.700
And of course, I'm starting at the skin, the fauna,

843
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.311
the paleofauna of the Miocene, because I realized

844
00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:09.791
that if the guardians, being high beings,

845
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:13.571
were to embody here it would have to be an ascension being,

846
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:18.491
a being with a large brain, and then I suddenly had it.

847
00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:24.852
The whales and the dolphins, the first modern sitations

848
00:40:24.852 --> 00:40:27.973
appear in the Miocene, now we have primitive sitations

849
00:40:27.973 --> 00:40:30.353
that go back to the Eocene, 50 million years ago,

850
00:40:30.353 --> 00:40:33.854
like primitive primates, but the first modern whales

851
00:40:33.854 --> 00:40:36.054
and dolphins appear at the same time.

852
00:40:36.054 --> 00:40:38.144
<v Regina>And, other indigenous cultures</v>

853
00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:41.156
also validate this in their law.

854
00:40:41.156 --> 00:40:43.797
<v ->In Polynesia they call the whales the record keepers.</v>

855
00:40:43.797 --> 00:40:46.557
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Yeah, they know.</v>

856
00:40:46.557 --> 00:40:49.697
And I suddenly realized that the whales and the dolphins

857
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:52.249
are the guardians who brought us here,

858
00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:54.400
which reveals that to kill them, for any reason,

859
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.781
<v Regina>Oh I know.</v>
<v ->is simply unthinkable.</v>

860
00:40:56.781 --> 00:40:58.644
<v Regina>I know.</v>
<v ->So, I looked at Makua</v>

861
00:40:58.644 --> 00:41:00.924
and he's realized I've figured it out.

862
00:41:00.924 --> 00:41:03.324
He said, "Bingo, you got it." and so,

863
00:41:03.324 --> 00:41:06.585
Jill was with us, so I had to give her a quick rundown,

864
00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:08.485
because she wasn't going on inside my head

865
00:41:08.485 --> 00:41:10.695
while I was thinking about this.

866
00:41:10.695 --> 00:41:12.557
So I said, the whales and the dolphins

867
00:41:12.557 --> 00:41:15.117
and he said, "Yes, they're the ones."

868
00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:18.497
I said, what was the knowledge that they gave us?

869
00:41:18.497 --> 00:41:19.697
I said, did they give it to us yet?

870
00:41:19.697 --> 00:41:22.608
He said, "Yes they have and then a lot of them are gone

871
00:41:22.608 --> 00:41:24.288
"and the rest of them are just about to go,

872
00:41:24.288 --> 00:41:26.809
"because their contract is up."

873
00:41:26.809 --> 00:41:29.109
I said, what was the knowledge that they gave us?

874
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:34.109
And he said, "The purpose of our being here is two-fold.

875
00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:36.969
"First of all, we're here to enjoy ourselves,

876
00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:41.289
"with the accent on the joy, we're here to grow and increase

877
00:41:41.289 --> 00:41:44.700
"and become more and evolve in the beauty

878
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.452
"of this beautiful planet."

879
00:41:47.452 --> 00:41:51.303
"And secondly, we're to remember our divine origins,

880
00:41:51.303 --> 00:41:53.863
"and this can only happen through one way,

881
00:41:53.863 --> 00:41:58.543
"through the experience of love for one another."

882
00:41:58.543 --> 00:42:01.443
<v Regina>Perfect.</v>
<v ->Yeah that's the whole story.</v>

883
00:42:01.443 --> 00:42:03.603
So, these were the Star People, we're a Star People,

884
00:42:03.603 --> 00:42:06.523
their a Star People, we were brought here.

885
00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:09.003
And, we used to talk about this, because he said,

886
00:42:09.003 --> 00:42:10.803
"You know, there does come a time when we come

887
00:42:10.803 --> 00:42:14.445
"to the end of our time here, when we're ready to step up

888
00:42:14.445 --> 00:42:18.095
"into the hierarchy and it's a tough choice."

889
00:42:18.095 --> 00:42:19.536
It's a tough choice, because to do that

890
00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:22.436
we have to give up our humanness.

891
00:42:22.436 --> 00:42:23.968
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->And so many choose</v>

892
00:42:23.968 --> 00:42:27.459
to return again and again, abort us off the path,

893
00:42:27.459 --> 00:42:29.699
in service to those who are still trapped

894
00:42:29.699 --> 00:42:32.868
in the illusionary world of samsara.

895
00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:37.188
But, Makua himself, I mean, he was an exalted soul.

896
00:42:37.188 --> 00:42:39.529
He was, you know, I've used the Dalai Lama image,

897
00:42:39.529 --> 00:42:41.328
he was very much like him.

898
00:42:41.328 --> 00:42:43.468
In fact, Makua sat on stage with the Dalai Lama

899
00:42:43.468 --> 00:42:45.438
at the United Nations.

900
00:42:45.438 --> 00:42:46.842
<v Regina>Hmm.</v>
<v ->He talked at</v>

901
00:42:46.842 --> 00:42:50.853
the United Nations so he was very well traveled.

902
00:42:50.853 --> 00:42:54.873
<v Regina>Well, what a wonderful experience for you,</v>

903
00:42:54.873 --> 00:42:57.913
who was awakening at the time, you had already awakened

904
00:42:57.913 --> 00:43:00.413
into your experiences by the time you met him.

905
00:43:00.413 --> 00:43:03.923
I mean, what a perfect alignment, what perfect timing

906
00:43:03.923 --> 00:43:07.633
that you should have met with him just prior to his death

907
00:43:07.633 --> 00:43:09.033
to have given you the permission

908
00:43:09.033 --> 00:43:11.953
to take this out into the world as well.

909
00:43:11.953 --> 00:43:13.545
<v ->Well, in that very first meeting,</v>

910
00:43:13.545 --> 00:43:15.525
he looked at me very seriously and said,

911
00:43:15.525 --> 00:43:18.185
"I've been looking for you for a long time.

912
00:43:18.185 --> 00:43:21.065
"I always knew that we would meet, I just didn't know when

913
00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:25.345
"or where, but now that we have I intend to pass information

914
00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:30.345
"to you and you will know how to handle this information."

915
00:43:30.765 --> 00:43:34.585
So, he's given me a lot and it's by no means

916
00:43:34.585 --> 00:43:36.076
all in that book, I mean that book

917
00:43:36.076 --> 00:43:38.708
is kind of like a foundation of his teachings.

918
00:43:38.708 --> 00:43:40.828
<v Regina>Are you going to continue, will you write more</v>

919
00:43:40.828 --> 00:43:42.128
in the future?
<v Hank>We'll see.</v>

920
00:43:42.128 --> 00:43:42.550
We'll see.
<v Regina>See how this one</v>

921
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.570
is received and utilized and--

922
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.610
<v ->Well, I haven't, if I can say this, I seem to have</v>

923
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.531
an active connection with his spirit.

924
00:43:50.531 --> 00:43:51.751
<v Regina>Yes, I understand that.</v>

925
00:43:51.751 --> 00:43:53.542
<v ->He comes to me a lot in my dreaming</v>

926
00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:56.322
and we have conversations inside my head.

927
00:43:56.322 --> 00:43:58.982
And so, I would have to talk with him about that

928
00:43:58.982 --> 00:44:01.962
and see what he wants, because he gave me permission

929
00:44:01.962 --> 00:44:04.922
to take it this far, and then we'll see what happens.

930
00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:06.563
<v Regina>Yeah, you have to be respectful.</v>

931
00:44:06.563 --> 00:44:08.233
<v ->We'll release it into the world and</v>

932
00:44:08.233 --> 00:44:10.605
then it has a life of it's own.

933
00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:12.125
But, there are a lot of people who are waiting

934
00:44:12.125 --> 00:44:13.936
for this knowledge, because there are a lot of people

935
00:44:13.936 --> 00:44:16.556
who know about my relationship with him, 'cause I've been

936
00:44:16.556 --> 00:44:18.567
talking about him for 15 years.

937
00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:20.958
<v Regina>Yes, in fact our last interview, you broached the</v>

938
00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:25.038
subject, so it must be about the time you were just thinking

939
00:44:25.038 --> 00:44:26.089
about writing this book.
<v Hank>Yeah.</v>

940
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:27.849
<v Regina>Or maybe had just started.</v>

941
00:44:27.849 --> 00:44:30.589
So, here we are a couple, two, three years later.

942
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:32.189
<v ->Well, it's my love letter to him.</v>

943
00:44:32.189 --> 00:44:33.229
<v Regina>Oh.</v>
<v ->It's a story about</v>

944
00:44:33.229 --> 00:44:37.110
our friendship as well, it's been very well received

945
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.650
by the endorsers, you know, Ralph Metzner wrote a wonderful

946
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:46.650
endorsement, Nicki Scully, Robert Moss, The Dreamer.

947
00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:51.062
Even Brooke Medicine Eagle.

948
00:44:51.062 --> 00:44:52.873
The Medicine Woman, Lynn Andrews

949
00:44:52.873 --> 00:44:54.733
wrote a wonderful endorsement as well.

950
00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:55.813
I had dinner with her in Santa Fe

951
00:44:55.813 --> 00:44:57.633
several years ago, I like her.

952
00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:59.853
(laughter)

953
00:44:59.853 --> 00:45:02.054
<v Regina>Wonderful, wild woman.</v>

954
00:45:02.054 --> 00:45:04.605
Let me ask you something, did he say anything to you

955
00:45:04.605 --> 00:45:09.245
from the, about, in the formation of the Earth

956
00:45:09.245 --> 00:45:12.225
and the various cosmic influences, did he ever talk to you

957
00:45:12.225 --> 00:45:15.245
about the moon or the role of the moon at all?

958
00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:16.405
<v ->He did.
<v Regina>Can you share</v>

959
00:45:16.405 --> 00:45:17.885
a little bit about that?

960
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:21.345
<v ->In Hawaiian the word for the moon is mahina</v>

961
00:45:21.345 --> 00:45:25.605
and the goddess of the moon is called Hina.

962
00:45:25.605 --> 00:45:28.165
He took me to a sacred crater up on the side

963
00:45:28.165 --> 00:45:32.145
of the mountain Mauna Kea, which is the mountain of vision.

964
00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:35.305
Mauna Kea is the most sacred mountain in Polynesia.

965
00:45:35.305 --> 00:45:37.945
The entire mountain is a temple, what the Hawaiians

966
00:45:37.945 --> 00:45:42.945
call a heiau and in the bottom of this crater, which is a,

967
00:45:43.177 --> 00:45:44.998
oh gosh, it's like a great big bowl up

968
00:45:44.998 --> 00:45:48.398
at around the 9,000 foot level, there is a heiau

969
00:45:48.398 --> 00:45:50.458
that he made and right in the center of it

970
00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:54.219
is a red stone that represents Hina.

971
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:59.219
He said that the moon is the foundation of the earth.

972
00:46:00.159 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Regina>Care to explain?</v>
<v ->Now, what does that mean?</v>

973
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.660
He didn't explain it to me.
<v Regina>Oh (laughs).</v>

974
00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.411
<v ->You know, he was well known for this,</v>

975
00:46:06.411 --> 00:46:08.342
he would sort of lay this stuff on you

976
00:46:08.342 --> 00:46:10.882
and see how you took it, how you ran with it.

977
00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:12.462
<v Regina>Well, the reason I ask is because</v>

978
00:46:12.462 --> 00:46:14.593
some of the other indigenous cultures believe

979
00:46:14.593 --> 00:46:17.753
that the moon came after the earth, that the moon

980
00:46:17.753 --> 00:46:22.224
is something that was, that was brought in and then began

981
00:46:22.224 --> 00:46:26.904
the motion of the waters on the planet, for example and--

982
00:46:26.904 --> 00:46:30.784
<v ->Well, I know, if, okay I'm gonna pull up the scientist.</v>

983
00:46:30.784 --> 00:46:32.484
I'm gonna pull up the scientist.

984
00:46:32.484 --> 00:46:34.704
Without the presence of the moon there could be

985
00:46:34.704 --> 00:46:39.145
no life on Earth, because the planetary surface

986
00:46:39.145 --> 00:46:43.245
would be swept by winds of at least 300 miles an hour.

987
00:46:43.245 --> 00:46:46.425
And, life under those circumstances would not be possible.

988
00:46:46.425 --> 00:46:49.505
It's the moon that creates the mediating influence

989
00:46:49.505 --> 00:46:53.425
that allows life to exist on the Earth at all.

990
00:46:53.425 --> 00:46:56.945
And, Makua knew this from his mystical perspective.

991
00:46:56.945 --> 00:47:01.265
Because, Hina, the goddess of the moon, is considered really

992
00:47:01.265 --> 00:47:04.436
to be the mother, the mother of the Hawaiian people.

993
00:47:04.436 --> 00:47:06.386
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->And, many people,</v>

994
00:47:06.386 --> 00:47:11.327
including the Gnostics for example, they understood

995
00:47:12.887 --> 00:47:15.898
that there is a spiritual relationship between the moon,

996
00:47:15.898 --> 00:47:19.928
the Earth and the sun, those are the three.

997
00:47:19.928 --> 00:47:24.420
And then, all the other planets are under other influences.

998
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.051
We could call them aliens if you like, because they're not

999
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:31.332
from this place, they're not from Earth.

1000
00:47:31.332 --> 00:47:34.112
You know, you don't have to have a body to be a being

1001
00:47:34.112 --> 00:47:36.352
and most of these other planets do not

1002
00:47:36.352 --> 00:47:39.093
support life, this is the life world.

1003
00:47:39.093 --> 00:47:41.633
But, there's a very strong relationship between the moon,

1004
00:47:41.633 --> 00:47:46.033
the Earth, and the sun which is exclusive.

1005
00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:50.783
This is our domain and those other influences out there,

1006
00:47:50.783 --> 00:47:54.194
they have no power here, although they try.

1007
00:47:54.194 --> 00:47:55.674
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->He was quite adamant</v>

1008
00:47:55.674 --> 00:47:57.325
about that, but you know--
<v Regina>Was it because</v>

1009
00:47:57.325 --> 00:48:00.705
a lot of, I mean there's so much in this field right now.

1010
00:48:00.705 --> 00:48:05.705
Of ufology, of alien interventions, of good aliens

1011
00:48:05.965 --> 00:48:10.025
that are here to assist, or protect at least, from the ones

1012
00:48:10.025 --> 00:48:13.065
who may be trying to interfere on a negative level.

1013
00:48:13.065 --> 00:48:16.065
What was his overall take on the

1014
00:48:16.065 --> 00:48:18.665
influence of alien cultures on Earth?

1015
00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:21.237
<v ->Well, you know, it was very difficult to get Makua</v>

1016
00:48:21.237 --> 00:48:24.417
to talk about stuff like this, because he didn't like

1017
00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:27.097
to go into the negative polarity, he just wouldn't go there.

1018
00:48:27.097 --> 00:48:29.757
He had made that decision to remain completely

1019
00:48:29.757 --> 00:48:31.319
in the positive polarity, in the state of aloha.

1020
00:48:31.319 --> 00:48:33.059
<v Regina>He'd emptied bowl of rocks.</v>

1021
00:48:33.059 --> 00:48:34.399
<v ->All the time.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

1022
00:48:34.399 --> 00:48:37.319
<v ->He also knew something that most of us know as well.</v>

1023
00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:40.559
If you talk about these dark forces, you attract them.

1024
00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:41.919
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->You're setting up</v>

1025
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:45.699
a connecting link to them and they're drawn to you.

1026
00:48:45.699 --> 00:48:48.682
<v Regina>And that's a very profound and true point, yes.</v>

1027
00:48:48.682 --> 00:48:50.562
<v ->That's one of the reasons you've got to stay in the</v>

1028
00:48:50.562 --> 00:48:53.182
positive polarity, especially if you're doing healing work.

1029
00:48:53.182 --> 00:48:56.562
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->I had one conversation</v>

1030
00:48:56.562 --> 00:49:00.033
with him, which I've recorded at the end of the book.

1031
00:49:00.033 --> 00:49:02.868
It's a very extraordinary conversation about how we humans

1032
00:49:02.868 --> 00:49:07.068
are actually gods, gods in becoming.

1033
00:49:07.068 --> 00:49:10.528
And, the chapter is called, On Becoming Gods,

1034
00:49:10.528 --> 00:49:13.528
and it was part of that chapter where he accidentally

1035
00:49:13.528 --> 00:49:16.388
gave part of the game away and he mentioned

1036
00:49:16.388 --> 00:49:21.388
a category of entities called the ‘e‘epa in Hawaiian.

1037
00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:24.809
So, I looked at him and said, who are the ‘e‘epa?

1038
00:49:24.809 --> 00:49:27.870
And he paused and he thought for quite awhile.

1039
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.931
Then, he came to a decision, you know,

1040
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:32.242
he hadn't meant to go there, but he had.

1041
00:49:32.242 --> 00:49:35.502
And he said, "The 'e'epa are the deceivers.

1042
00:49:35.502 --> 00:49:37.882
<v Regina>Oh, interesting.</v>
<v ->They're what many call</v>

1043
00:49:37.882 --> 00:49:41.352
the masters of deception, the Gnostics

1044
00:49:41.352 --> 00:49:45.174
knew them and called them the archons.

1045
00:49:45.174 --> 00:49:47.394
Now, the interesting thing about the archons,

1046
00:49:47.394 --> 00:49:49.874
if I were to just use that word for them,

1047
00:49:49.874 --> 00:49:54.874
is that they're not spirits, they're mind parasites.

1048
00:49:55.054 --> 00:49:59.384
They're thought forms and they live in the human mind.

1049
00:49:59.384 --> 00:50:02.744
<v Regina>Are they generated by the human mind?</v>

1050
00:50:02.744 --> 00:50:03.970
<v ->Not originally.
<v Regina>Or are they,</v>

1051
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:05.670
okay let's talk about the origin.

1052
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.711
<v ->Not originally, they were kind of a cosmic accident</v>

1053
00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:14.641
that happened as part of the creation.

1054
00:50:15.321 --> 00:50:19.863
You know John Lash's book, Not in His Image, discusses this.

1055
00:50:19.863 --> 00:50:24.753
He talks about the mythic, the mythos of the Sophia.

1056
00:50:25.403 --> 00:50:28.643
The Sophia, this planet is the Sophia,

1057
00:50:28.643 --> 00:50:32.043
it is her physical body and her spiritual form is

1058
00:50:32.043 --> 00:50:35.963
that milky white light with a vast intelligence and voice,

1059
00:50:35.963 --> 00:50:39.163
which mystics across time have all made contact with.

1060
00:50:39.163 --> 00:50:40.984
We all know about her.

1061
00:50:40.984 --> 00:50:43.764
People perceive her in their own way, for example,

1062
00:50:43.764 --> 00:50:46.124
Elijah the prophet when he talks about being

1063
00:50:46.124 --> 00:50:48.305
in the presence of the angel of the Lord,

1064
00:50:48.305 --> 00:50:50.725
he's not talking about a winged superhuman.

1065
00:50:50.725 --> 00:50:55.346
He's talking about that light, that white light, that's her.

1066
00:50:55.346 --> 00:50:58.726
So, in talking about the Sophia, the Gnostics talked about

1067
00:50:58.726 --> 00:51:01.968
a kind of cosmic accident that happened in the creation

1068
00:51:01.968 --> 00:51:06.268
of this planet, which is her dream, and this gave rise

1069
00:51:06.268 --> 00:51:10.348
to the beings called the archons, the deceivers.

1070
00:51:10.348 --> 00:51:14.108
Now, the archons are in the negative polarity.

1071
00:51:14.108 --> 00:51:16.409
They're not evil, but what they do is

1072
00:51:16.409 --> 00:51:21.249
they encourage human beings to err in their behavior.

1073
00:51:21.249 --> 00:51:23.201
And they encourage us to go in this direction.

1074
00:51:23.201 --> 00:51:26.441
They encourage us to go into our fears, into our doubts,

1075
00:51:26.441 --> 00:51:29.892
because it creates separation, that's what they do.

1076
00:51:29.892 --> 00:51:31.532
And, as we go more and more deeply

1077
00:51:31.532 --> 00:51:34.292
into the negative polarity, we reach a threshold

1078
00:51:34.292 --> 00:51:38.283
at some point and if we choose to step across it,

1079
00:51:38.283 --> 00:51:40.875
we create the realm of evil.

1080
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:43.695
See, evil was not created by a war in heaven,

1081
00:51:43.695 --> 00:51:47.495
humans created evil, that was our great sin.

1082
00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:50.156
But, we had encouragement from these negative forces

1083
00:51:50.156 --> 00:51:54.856
called the archons, or what Makua called the deceivers.

1084
00:51:54.856 --> 00:51:58.876
And as such, he told me that they are the ones

1085
00:51:58.876 --> 00:52:03.017
who are involved and do these alien abduction experiences.

1086
00:52:03.017 --> 00:52:05.978
They're mimics, they're very accomplished mimics.

1087
00:52:05.978 --> 00:52:09.978
They're not creative, see we have creative imagination.

1088
00:52:09.978 --> 00:52:13.840
They don't and one of the reasons they attach to us

1089
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.261
is they want to become us, they wanna become more like us.

1090
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:19.752
I think this might have something to do

1091
00:52:19.752 --> 00:52:24.752
with all those hybridizations that people see in UFOs,

1092
00:52:25.054 --> 00:52:27.694
when they're having the alien abduction experience.

1093
00:52:27.694 --> 00:52:30.014
And he said, you know, the archons, the 'e'epa

1094
00:52:30.014 --> 00:52:32.785
take two forms, they're the small embryonic ones

1095
00:52:32.785 --> 00:52:36.165
with big heads and black eyes and then they're the tall,

1096
00:52:36.165 --> 00:52:39.016
reptilian, or insect, like ones.

1097
00:52:39.016 --> 00:52:41.356
And we, I'm sure you've talked about the reptilians

1098
00:52:41.356 --> 00:52:42.207
<v Regina>Oh yeah.</v>
<v ->with people like David Icke.</v>

1099
00:52:42.207 --> 00:52:44.539
<v Regina>I've interviewed a number of people on both, yes.</v>

1100
00:52:44.539 --> 00:52:48.819
<v ->Yeah, that's who they are and they're not true spirits.</v>

1101
00:52:48.819 --> 00:52:52.219
They're actually mind parasites, but once you see them

1102
00:52:52.219 --> 00:52:54.551
for who they are and you understand

1103
00:52:54.551 --> 00:52:57.302
what you're dealing with, they're done.

1104
00:52:57.302 --> 00:52:59.452
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>
<v ->They're done.</v>

1105
00:52:59.452 --> 00:53:01.473
They cannot touch you anymore.

1106
00:53:01.473 --> 00:53:04.193
<v Regina>Interesting that's a whole different take on it.</v>

1107
00:53:04.193 --> 00:53:07.613
<v ->Well, it's the kahuna take and he only talked</v>

1108
00:53:07.613 --> 00:53:10.513
about this with me once and when we were in privacy.

1109
00:53:10.513 --> 00:53:12.553
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->But, I did have, there is</v>

1110
00:53:12.553 --> 00:53:15.845
a little section in The Bowl of Light about the 'e'epa,

1111
00:53:15.845 --> 00:53:18.565
about the deceivers toward the end of the book.

1112
00:53:18.565 --> 00:53:19.706
People will find that very interesting, I think.

1113
00:53:19.706 --> 00:53:23.013
<v Regina>I'm sure they will, because there's just such</v>

1114
00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:26.494
conflicting information over all of this going on right now.

1115
00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:28.546
<v ->That's the archons.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1116
00:53:28.546 --> 00:53:33.166
<v ->They're feeding that, that's their job to create confusion</v>

1117
00:53:33.166 --> 00:53:36.257
and they can assume any form that they wish to the person

1118
00:53:36.257 --> 00:53:38.377
they wish to deceive, because they just reach

1119
00:53:38.377 --> 00:53:41.719
into that person's mind, take that image and become it.

1120
00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:43.579
And then mirror it back.
<v Regina>Well, and I think</v>

1121
00:53:43.579 --> 00:53:47.471
there are some people too, where there are those who really,

1122
00:53:47.471 --> 00:53:50.231
their minds have been taken with this to the extent

1123
00:53:50.231 --> 00:53:54.062
that there is a great amount of fear within their being

1124
00:53:54.062 --> 00:53:57.712
that that they're living within, where as,

1125
00:53:57.712 --> 00:54:01.693
myself I don't see that, that's not my connection.

1126
00:54:01.693 --> 00:54:02.693
<v ->Yeah, I understand.</v>

1127
00:54:02.693 --> 00:54:03.374
<v Regina>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1128
00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:04.274
<v ->I do.
<v Regina>And I watch</v>

1129
00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:07.975
where it takes people over into the negative.

1130
00:54:07.975 --> 00:54:09.675
And, that's not to say there aren't

1131
00:54:09.675 --> 00:54:12.146
vast arrays of species out there,

1132
00:54:12.146 --> 00:54:14.246
and vast arrays of species that have even come

1133
00:54:14.246 --> 00:54:16.766
and gone throughout history, technologically.

1134
00:54:16.766 --> 00:54:19.166
What you're talking about is something different.

1135
00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.146
What he was talking about was something different.

1136
00:54:21.146 --> 00:54:22.456
<v ->He said something very interesting too.</v>

1137
00:54:22.456 --> 00:54:24.309
<v Regina>It's almost interdimensional.</v>

1138
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:26.369
<v ->He said that psychics who channel</v>

1139
00:54:26.369 --> 00:54:29.120
are particularly vulnerable to them.

1140
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.640
<v Regina>Interesting, okay.</v>

1141
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.860
<v ->This is why it's so important for psychics,</v>

1142
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.460
for clairvoyants to check their sources.

1143
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.820
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

1144
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.231
<v ->There are so many well intentioned people out there</v>

1145
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:43.911
with very watery boundaries, okay, they've been

1146
00:54:43.911 --> 00:54:46.631
very watery boundaries, they're not well protected.

1147
00:54:46.631 --> 00:54:49.021
And if they channel, they are vulnerable

1148
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:50.963
to these entities and I think this is why

1149
00:54:50.963 --> 00:54:54.023
there's so much conflicting information.

1150
00:54:54.023 --> 00:54:55.704
<v Regina>There ya go, I'm sure that is part of it.</v>

1151
00:54:55.704 --> 00:54:56.704
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Now, let's go</v>

1152
00:54:56.704 --> 00:55:01.704
from there to, maybe just one more, I do wanna put it

1153
00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:05.807
in this arena, inspirational, hopeful

1154
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:08.838
bit of information coming out of this book.

1155
00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:11.770
<v ->Well, you know Makua was quite adamant that we actually</v>

1156
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.570
come into this world as Gods.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

1157
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:17.782
<v ->It's just that we forgot because we went through the veil.</v>

1158
00:55:17.782 --> 00:55:21.242
We come into this as holy beings and we're here

1159
00:55:21.242 --> 00:55:24.233
working on our life lessons and we're gonna continue

1160
00:55:24.233 --> 00:55:27.033
to work on those life lessons until we're done here.

1161
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:28.933
You know, there's just no getting out of it.

1162
00:55:28.933 --> 00:55:31.734
But, he said the goal in each lifetime is to remember

1163
00:55:31.734 --> 00:55:34.965
that holiness within us and to become a holy being

1164
00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:37.125
once again, before we check out.

1165
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:39.865
It's about clearing the bowl of stones so you don't take 'em

1166
00:55:39.865 --> 00:55:43.165
back into your original field when you leave.

1167
00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:45.625
So, he was quite adamant on, about the fact

1168
00:55:45.625 --> 00:55:48.566
that we are actually gods in becoming.

1169
00:55:48.566 --> 00:55:52.579
And that eventually, we cross that threshold

1170
00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:56.459
and we walk the path towards our destiny

1171
00:55:56.459 --> 00:55:58.040
in a completely new way,

1172
00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.981
in a completely new and extended way.

1173
00:56:00.981 --> 00:56:02.901
He also said something very interesting, he said,

1174
00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:06.321
"You know when you align yourself with spirit's purpose."

1175
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.441
He said there are impulses that come in with us,

1176
00:56:08.441 --> 00:56:12.341
which are built into our field, into our energetic field.

1177
00:56:12.341 --> 00:56:15.681
He said, "When you align yourself with spirit, you know,

1178
00:56:15.681 --> 00:56:18.543
"you're on the path to your destiny."

1179
00:56:18.543 --> 00:56:23.023
But, when you align yourself with what your body wants.

1180
00:56:23.023 --> 00:56:25.103
Okay, you're body is particularly vulnerable,

1181
00:56:25.103 --> 00:56:27.283
because it's motivated by desire.

1182
00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:28.894
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Alright.</v>

1183
00:56:28.894 --> 00:56:32.765
That's when you put yourself in the hands of the fates.

1184
00:56:32.765 --> 00:56:34.675
<v Regina>That is true and a lot of times people</v>

1185
00:56:34.675 --> 00:56:36.547
can't distinguish the difference.

1186
00:56:36.547 --> 00:56:37.798
<v ->They don't.
<v Regina>And that's where</v>

1187
00:56:37.798 --> 00:56:39.889
the meditation and the connection and such

1188
00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:44.509
is just so valuable in these interesting times we're in.

1189
00:56:44.509 --> 00:56:46.389
<v ->That's why discrimination is essential.</v>

1190
00:56:46.389 --> 00:56:48.109
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Yeah, if you're gonna be</v>

1191
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:50.709
a spiritual warrior, you have to be very discriminating

1192
00:56:50.709 --> 00:56:54.489
about the information you receive and what it means.

1193
00:56:54.489 --> 00:56:57.061
We're all finding our way, we're all on the path,

1194
00:56:57.061 --> 00:57:00.001
we're all gonna get there, it's just a question of when.

1195
00:57:00.001 --> 00:57:01.841
It's really beautiful when you think of it.

1196
00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:04.652
<v Regina>It is indeed and on that note, thank you again.</v>

1197
00:57:04.652 --> 00:57:08.432
I'm so glad, it's interesting, speaking of the way

1198
00:57:08.432 --> 00:57:13.312
our beings arrange things for us, I ran into you yesterday

1199
00:57:13.312 --> 00:57:17.392
on the second stair on a flight of stairs.

1200
00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:19.732
You were coming up and I was going down.

1201
00:57:19.732 --> 00:57:23.292
I ran into you an hour or two later on the exact same stair,

1202
00:57:23.292 --> 00:57:26.012
except I was going up and you were going down

1203
00:57:26.012 --> 00:57:29.882
and I thought, meant to be, that's that, what are the odds.

1204
00:57:29.882 --> 00:57:31.025
<v ->It sounds like the guys upstairs</v>

1205
00:57:31.025 --> 00:57:32.405
have taken a hand in things.

1206
00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:35.085
<v Regina>I think so and I'm very happy they did.</v>

1207
00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:36.485
It's great to see you again Hank.

1208
00:57:36.485 --> 00:57:41.416
<v ->Thanks Regina, good on ya, blessings on your work.</v>

1209
00:57:42.836 --> 00:57:44.768
<v ->To understand more about Hank's journey,</v>

1210
00:57:44.768 --> 00:57:47.099
you can watch our other previous interviews with him.

1211
00:57:47.099 --> 00:57:50.359
You can also go to his website, sharedwisdom.com,

1212
00:57:50.359 --> 00:57:53.340
to check into his other previous books, most of which focus

1213
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.260
on the need to connect with our own inner Shaman.

1214
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.520
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
