00:00:00.795 --> 00:00:02.920
<v ->Many of us can barely remember a time</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.696
when we didn't have cell phones.

3
00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:06.391
In fact, they've become such an integral

4
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:07.958
and common part of our lives

5
00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.965
that we've ceased to question the technology anymore.

6
00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:12.939
One man who has not stopped questioning

7
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.657
is Dr. Nick Begich.

8
00:00:14.657 --> 00:00:17.002
best known for his work in the area of HAARP,

9
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:18.776
Dr. Begich has turned his attention

10
00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:21.040
to 21st century technologies

11
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.781
and the truth behind their interface

12
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.045
with the human body and brain.

13
00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:26.787
This is an interview not to be missed

14
00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:28.215
and one that you'll likely want to share

15
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.833
with your family and friends.

16
00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:44.238
We're talking about 21st century technologies

17
00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:47.974
and one of the really interesting, I think fascinating,

18
00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:50.830
technologies that affect most of us now

19
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.676
is cell phone technology

20
00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:54.800
and it's my understanding that some of this

21
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.738
may actually be affecting us in a negative way.

22
00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:58.713
<v ->Yeah and that's right.</v>

23
00:00:58.713 --> 00:01:01.523
You know, cell phones have been one of the few devices

24
00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:03.845
that we've had in large circulation

25
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:05.656
where we've actually taken something

26
00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:07.986
that produces a radio frequency signal

27
00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:09.925
and stuck it right next to the head.

28
00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:11.957
And you know, this created quite a bit of controversy.

29
00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:13.733
Many will remember years ago

30
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.405
there was an incident in Florida

31
00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:17.971
where somebody had asserted they had a brain tumor formed

32
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.897
from cell phone use and there was a lawsuit filed.

33
00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:23.312
The Congress got involved and this became

34
00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:24.403
quite the controversy

35
00:01:24.403 --> 00:01:26.841
and what happened in those congressional hearings

36
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:31.148
eventually the industry agreed to do a $25 million study

37
00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:33.412
where they would look at cell phones

38
00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:35.223
and the literature surrounding cell phones

39
00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:37.787
and what had already been done in the research

40
00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:40.442
and try and figure out whether indeed there was

41
00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:44.889
a biological effect, an effect on our health or on our minds

42
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.093
and so what happened is

43
00:01:46.093 --> 00:01:48.357
they hired a guy named Dr. George Carlo

44
00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:52.258
and Dr. Carlo put together a team of experts.

45
00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.963
The unusual thing was instead of reporting to

46
00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:57.111
say an engineering group or something like this

47
00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:00.339
and with the cell phone industry, his primary contact

48
00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:03.009
was our chief lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

49
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.552
After five years, he completed his work,

50
00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:08.013
he produced a study.

51
00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:09.719
The industry went forward with it and said

52
00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.517
everything is wonderful and everything is safe

53
00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:15.792
and George Carlo was so incensed because he felt

54
00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:19.727
that there were significant problems with cell phones

55
00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:21.167
and he published a book called

56
00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:22.769
"Cell Phones: The Invisible Hazards."

57
00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.673
And what he showed in his theoretical model was that

58
00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:29.141
the heating that, the heat transfer from the phone

59
00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:32.612
into the head, actually caused a breakdown

60
00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:34.071
in the blood brain barrier,

61
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.707
the things that separate toxins from getting into the brain

62
00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:40.550
and he felt that the most likely mechanism for tumor

63
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.822
formation was in fact the slowing of the repair of DNA,

64
00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:46.215
which normally would take place,

65
00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:47.887
but by slowing it down,

66
00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:50.999
that's where the tumor formation would occur

67
00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.030
and that's what he felt the mechanism was.

68
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.132
<v Voiceover>But you're saying that the heat transfer</v>

69
00:02:55.132 --> 00:02:58.394
was creating a slowing down of the normal DNA repair?

70
00:02:58.394 --> 00:02:59.369
<v ->That's correct.</v>

71
00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.341
And this slowing down is sort of the root of the problem

72
00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:04.431
in that particular incident.

73
00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:05.871
Now, what he looked at

74
00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:08.611
was he looked at children say at five years old

75
00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.477
and at five years old, 400% more energy

76
00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:16.285
actually transfers through the phone, through the skull

77
00:03:16.285 --> 00:03:18.119
because of skull thickness is much smaller

78
00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.488
in a five year old than in an adult.

79
00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:23.492
A 10 year old, 200% more energy transfers

80
00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:25.628
and then of course the adult transfer.

81
00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:27.892
Now, in Great Britain they take this into consideration.

82
00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:29.367
The beginning of the school year

83
00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:30.597
there are warnings that go out

84
00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:33.175
that tell parents if you're kids are under 16,

85
00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:35.671
you know, dissuade their use from cell phones

86
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:37.804
because they utilize in Europe what's called

87
00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:39.279
the precautionary principle,

88
00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.775
which says that once you have information

89
00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:43.807
that says there may be a problem,

90
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.815
you don't wait till there's absolute proof.

91
00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:48.277
You begin to give that information to the public

92
00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:49.911
so that they can utilize that information

93
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:50.781
in making decisions.

94
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:53.487
Now, this applies to areas in health

95
00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:54.996
and areas within the environment

96
00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:57.654
and this principle's been applied in Europe about 30 years

97
00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.499
and never once have they been wrong,

98
00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.436
not waiting for this final proof of the studies

99
00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:04.737
like we do in the United States.

100
00:04:04.737 --> 00:04:06.768
Now, there's been several other studies

101
00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:07.999
beyond George Carlo's.

102
00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.031
There was one study that we actually cite

103
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:11.665
in some of our work

104
00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:15.044
that involved 15,000 individuals in Scandinavia.

105
00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:18.585
Now, Scandinavia, Finland in particular,

106
00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:21.545
Nokia was sort of the beginning of this whole industry

107
00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:24.250
and so the density of the population

108
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.456
that use cell phones is quite high

109
00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:28.128
and there's some history, there's some time

110
00:04:28.128 --> 00:04:31.158
that we can actually take a look over a period of time.

111
00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:35.233
Now what that study said is essentially an hour of use,

112
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.323
which is per day, which is pretty standard,

113
00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:38.565
you know, when you think about how people

114
00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:41.108
use these things all over the world now,

115
00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:43.442
was sufficient to create a number of effects.

116
00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:46.170
One of those effects was heating behind the ears,

117
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.945
which most people go, "Yeah I feel that."

118
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.648
The other was interference with sleep rhythms,

119
00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:56.038
interference with short-term memory,

120
00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:57.652
interference with sex drive.

121
00:04:57.652 --> 00:04:59.974
All these things were being reported,

122
00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:03.852
not just the most severe situations of tumor formation,

123
00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:06.661
but these other types of incidences.

124
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:08.983
Fatigue was often reported

125
00:05:08.983 --> 00:05:12.130
associated with excessive cell phone use.

126
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.533
The problem with the device,

127
00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:16.309
and you can go back to the work

128
00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:18.713
of Professor Lin at the University of Washington

129
00:05:18.713 --> 00:05:21.348
back in the '60s was doing work for the Navy

130
00:05:21.348 --> 00:05:24.251
where he was analyzing various energy forms

131
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.748
in the microwave range,

132
00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:26.816
in the range of cell phones,

133
00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:28.883
precisely in the range of cell phones,

134
00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:31.217
and looking at physiological effects

135
00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:34.247
and what he found in five out of six studies

136
00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:36.964
there was actually a mutation

137
00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:39.390
in the formation of chick embryos

138
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.700
because of changes to DNA structures.

139
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.326
So when cell phones came out

140
00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:45.834
and Dr. Carlo's reports came out

141
00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:47.772
and then the industry said everything is safe,

142
00:05:47.772 --> 00:05:50.303
this gentleman came forward and said wait a minute,

143
00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:51.546
you know, we did these studies

144
00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:53.902
before cell phones ever existed

145
00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:55.946
and we know that energy densities

146
00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:58.012
that are equal to what cell phones produce

147
00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.545
in those frequency ranges

148
00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:03.887
are in fact hazardous to person's long-term health.

149
00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:06.023
And so this individual was just one.

150
00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:08.090
The other one that came forward was Ross Adey

151
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.563
and Ross Adey, which is A-D-E-Y.

152
00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:11.956
If you do a search on the Internet,

153
00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:14.998
he is one of the most published scientists in the world.

154
00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:17.366
He had hundreds of peer-reviewed papers.

155
00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:21.871
He was used extensively by the military for looking at

156
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:25.006
all kinds of electromagnetic field effects on human beings.

157
00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:28.047
Even Motorola hired him once to look at cell phones.

158
00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:30.509
And what he had found is one particular range

159
00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:31.948
that cell phones operated within

160
00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:35.013
would actually create a beneficial health effect,

161
00:06:35.013 --> 00:06:37.951
but the fact that it created any effect

162
00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:40.946
then moved this into the realm of the FDA.

163
00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:43.756
So the funding was pulled, his project was canceled.

164
00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:46.798
Ross Adey also, prior to his death, came forward

165
00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:49.131
and you'll see it on the Internet with a good search.

166
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.569
And he was incensed by the fact that the industry

167
00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.006
was dampening what the public was really entitled to know,

168
00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:57.270
that there were things that could be done.

169
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.406
Now since Carlo's work came out,

170
00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:02.111
there have been over a dozen patents

171
00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:05.478
filed by the industry to make cell phones safer.

172
00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:07.173
And we're not just talking cellular phones,

173
00:07:07.173 --> 00:07:10.888
the home portable phones actually can be potentially

174
00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:12.850
more dangerous because the energy densities

175
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.196
tend to be a little more intense

176
00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:17.355
because the batteries can be recharged regularly.

177
00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:19.526
You're not worried about conserving that battery juice

178
00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:21.128
or conserving that energy.

179
00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:24.936
At the same time, the circuitry is more poorly designed

180
00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:26.605
so you have more leakage from those circuits,

181
00:07:26.605 --> 00:07:29.798
more radiation actually coming off of the phones.

182
00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:31.435
The ideal cell phones,

183
00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:32.410
'cause they're not going away.

184
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.041
I mean, obviously we're going to have them for forever.

185
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:37.376
The thing that can change

186
00:07:37.376 --> 00:07:39.176
is the way in which they're designed

187
00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:41.219
and this is again something that could be

188
00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:43.785
easily integrated into cell phone design.

189
00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:45.387
If you take the speakerphones, for instance,

190
00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:47.686
that you hold away from your head.

191
00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:51.459
That distance is sufficient, for most theoretical models,

192
00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:53.361
to make them quite safe and reasonable.

193
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.992
You know, and of course your conversation's

194
00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:55.868
no longer private,

195
00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:58.036
but is it anyway when you're on a cell phone? (laughs)

196
00:07:58.036 --> 00:07:59.603
<v Voiceover>Well now what about the little earbuds</v>

197
00:07:59.603 --> 00:08:00.764
and ear pieces?

198
00:08:00.764 --> 00:08:02.576
<v ->Well some of the ear pieces are quite good.</v>

199
00:08:02.576 --> 00:08:06.279
If the insulators are well designed and well made, it's fine

200
00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:09.112
but often you find them very thinly insulated

201
00:08:09.112 --> 00:08:11.643
and they actually shunt energy into the inner ear

202
00:08:11.643 --> 00:08:13.245
and so you feel even more heating

203
00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:15.254
concentrated sort of in the ear.

204
00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:16.984
In that case, there's some simple things

205
00:08:16.984 --> 00:08:18.583
that a person could do.

206
00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:22.577
One of those is taking a small piece of magnetic metal,

207
00:08:22.577 --> 00:08:23.796
like bailing wire, you know,

208
00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:25.120
that you can pick it up with a magnet.

209
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.092
And if you make a coil around that lead wire

210
00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:29.055
that's coming into the ear,

211
00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:30.298
so you have the wire coming in,

212
00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:32.399
you make a coil around this part,

213
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.268
what happens is as the energy moves up,

214
00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:35.975
it hits that coil and it dissipates,

215
00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:37.507
doesn't make it in the inner ear.

216
00:08:37.507 --> 00:08:39.876
You know, it's similar to what those small devices now

217
00:08:39.876 --> 00:08:41.873
with electronic equipment that they clip on

218
00:08:41.873 --> 00:08:43.510
so you don't get the disturbance.

219
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.807
It's essentially taking that energy and dissipating it

220
00:08:46.807 --> 00:08:48.351
in a way that it doesn't interfere

221
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.045
and the same can be done cheaply and simply.

222
00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:53.622
I mean, anyone can do that with the earbuds.

223
00:08:53.622 --> 00:08:56.792
The other thing to consider is where you place the phone.

224
00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:57.964
I mean, most people, what do they do?

225
00:08:57.964 --> 00:08:59.961
They put the phone on their waist.

226
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:01.795
Well there you have a lot of soft tissue.

227
00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:04.498
So the heat energy actually penetrates deeper.

228
00:09:04.498 --> 00:09:06.468
So you can affect the internal organs in a way

229
00:09:06.468 --> 00:09:08.534
that might not be beneficial at all.

230
00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:11.100
The ideal is with that type of ear piece

231
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.039
to set the phone next to you.

232
00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.711
If you don't have that kind of ear piece,

233
00:09:14.711 --> 00:09:16.673
just the manner in which you hold the phone.

234
00:09:16.673 --> 00:09:19.111
Get your index finger between you and that phone.

235
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:20.319
Get a little bit of distance

236
00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:23.848
'cause just an inch of distance, you can still hear fine,

237
00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:27.285
will cause that energy concentration or energy density

238
00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:30.187
to be reduced by probably two or three times.

239
00:09:30.187 --> 00:09:31.464
Just getting it away from the ear

240
00:09:31.464 --> 00:09:33.264
and not pressing it up against the head

241
00:09:33.264 --> 00:09:36.166
where that energy transfer happens fairly efficiently.

242
00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:37.571
So simple things can be done.

243
00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:41.008
<v Voiceover>But there are, I've seen other small devices.</v>

244
00:09:41.008 --> 00:09:44.003
Just little buttons, pads,

245
00:09:44.003 --> 00:09:45.710
little bits of film that are sticky

246
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.879
that they say can help if you stick it on the inside,

247
00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:52.118
inside the battery or on top where the antennae is.

248
00:09:52.118 --> 00:09:53.721
How effective are those kinds

249
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:55.485
of ameliorating technologies?

250
00:09:55.485 --> 00:09:57.412
<v ->Now there's, we researched this</v>

251
00:09:57.412 --> 00:09:58.550
because we were very interested,

252
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.089
and you know, when we talk about technology

253
00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:01.923
we also like to talk about what are the solutions

254
00:10:01.923 --> 00:10:03.929
and what's out there and the ones I've already given

255
00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:05.566
are the ones that cost nobody anything

256
00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:07.864
and that's, of course, the ideal.

257
00:10:07.864 --> 00:10:09.699
The other thing that you're speaking about

258
00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:12.299
is these small RF absorbers

259
00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:14.944
or some kind of ceramic materials.

260
00:10:14.944 --> 00:10:16.163
Now, we went and looked at

261
00:10:16.163 --> 00:10:17.637
everything out there on the market.

262
00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:20.145
About the same time, the Federal Trade Commission

263
00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:22.270
in the United States was doing the same thing

264
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.416
and they jerked seven devices off the market

265
00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:26.821
for making false claims

266
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:29.851
because they had no science behind them whatsoever.

267
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:30.954
When we went out and looked,

268
00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:33.427
we found one device with a US patent

269
00:10:33.427 --> 00:10:35.877
and that particular device we've carried for years

270
00:10:35.877 --> 00:10:38.199
because it has the science behind it

271
00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:40.161
and it was developed by one of the largest

272
00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:42.459
electronics companies in Korea

273
00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.828
that was looking for a ceramic material

274
00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:48.299
and something to buffer microcircuits from RF,

275
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:50.134
from radio frequency interference,

276
00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:52.839
because that's a big problem with fine circuit design.

277
00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:55.010
So you need certain kinds of insulators

278
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.682
or things to protect those circuits.

279
00:10:56.682 --> 00:11:00.014
And as a side, a spin-off, for them

280
00:11:00.014 --> 00:11:02.649
they developed a similar technology

281
00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:04.158
that could be used on cell phones

282
00:11:04.158 --> 00:11:06.689
and they applied for the US patent and they received it.

283
00:11:06.689 --> 00:11:09.824
But it only reduces the energy by about 60%

284
00:11:09.824 --> 00:11:11.914
in the cell phones tested,

285
00:11:11.914 --> 00:11:14.700
which is, you know, it's a nice step in the right direction,

286
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.964
but at the same time there are claims being made

287
00:11:16.964 --> 00:11:19.820
by others that you can knock out 100% of the energy.

288
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.736
If you knock out 100% of the energy,

289
00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:23.164
then the phone isn't on (laughs)

290
00:11:23.164 --> 00:11:24.470
and there's no battery in it.

291
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.107
You know, because you can't do that.

292
00:11:26.107 --> 00:11:28.310
And the fact is, a certain amount of energy

293
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.040
has to flow through the circuit.

294
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.976
A certain amount of that energy is going to leak

295
00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:33.381
from that circuit.

296
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:35.413
The ideal would be to see the industry

297
00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:37.247
put the requisite energy and effort

298
00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:40.057
into building better ceramic materials,

299
00:11:40.057 --> 00:11:42.657
but this of course drives the cost of the hardware up,

300
00:11:42.657 --> 00:11:44.724
which creates the problem.

301
00:11:44.724 --> 00:11:46.953
The other thing is the way the phones are rated.

302
00:11:46.953 --> 00:11:50.657
You know, between one model within the same brand name

303
00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:52.735
and another model within the same brand name

304
00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:55.835
we have seen as much as a 600% difference

305
00:11:55.835 --> 00:11:57.309
from one phone to the other

306
00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:59.399 line:15% 
in terms of how much energy is transferred.

307
00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:01.210 line:15% 
You know, and we've put on our website,

308
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.940 line:15% 
which is probably gonna be linked to this,

309
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.773 line:15% 
the idea that there's 10 that are the worst

310
00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:06.771
and 10 that are the best

311
00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:08.513
and then there's a website that's indicated

312
00:12:08.513 --> 00:12:10.113
where you can go and look at all the phones

313
00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:12.321
that have been made to see how they rate.

314
00:12:12.321 --> 00:12:15.189
The rating system should be promoted.

315
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:16.825
They should discuss that rating system

316
00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:20.123
and those ratings right now are on the inside of the package

317
00:12:20.123 --> 00:12:21.934
where you can't see them when you buy the phone

318
00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:23.130
and they should be on the outside

319
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.533
so people can make informed decisions

320
00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:27.170
and get the best phone possible.

321
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.527
In the interim, speaker phones are the best.

322
00:12:29.527 --> 00:12:31.605
Hold them away from your head.

323
00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:35.947
Secondly, until all of the evidence is in,

324
00:12:35.947 --> 00:12:39.384
children should not be using cell phones at all.

325
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.310
<v Voiceover>And they're popularized in every sitcom</v>

326
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.552
where little teeny boppers have their cell phones on

327
00:12:43.552 --> 00:12:44.852
from age eight.

328
00:12:44.852 --> 00:12:48.196
<v ->Right, you know, and kids are out there.</v>

329
00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:49.392
They're using them all the time.

330
00:12:49.392 --> 00:12:52.596
You know, it is all the promotion in the United States

331
00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:55.635
is oriented about family use, kids use.

332
00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:57.931
Yet when you look at the literature,

333
00:12:57.931 --> 00:12:59.754
we did an article on this.

334
00:12:59.754 --> 00:13:02.134
We published it some time ago on the web.

335
00:13:02.134 --> 00:13:05.837
It's on our website, there's 89 sourced documents cited.

336
00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:08.206
All of them are mainstream or academic studies,

337
00:13:08.206 --> 00:13:10.377
things that people can sink their teeth into.

338
00:13:10.377 --> 00:13:14.046
But we're talking about a multibillion dollar industry,

339
00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:16.356
you know, an industry that is not going to go away

340
00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:19.456
and from my perspective over time what we're going to see

341
00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:22.451
is CEOs and very active people, leaders,

342
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.888
the kind of people that use these phones

343
00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:26.091
for hours and hours a day, attorneys.

344
00:13:26.091 --> 00:13:29.202
I mean, Johnny Cochran just died of a brain tumor.

345
00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:31.071
You know, start looking at how many people

346
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:34.601
are dying of brain tumors today versus 20 years ago

347
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:36.598
and I think you're gonna see a trend line

348
00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:38.571
that eventually is gonna get disclosed to the public

349
00:13:38.571 --> 00:13:40.441
as another mystery illness.

350
00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:41.996
The only difference is the correlations

351
00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:45.178
between what side of the head you're holding your phones

352
00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:47.012
would indicate a great deal

353
00:13:47.012 --> 00:13:49.450
and I think this is something that needs

354
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.852
not more study, but immediate discussion of,

355
00:13:52.852 --> 00:13:55.661
the studies can continue, but people need to know

356
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:57.751
so we can make the wise decisions that we need to make.

357
00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:00.526
As busy as I am, I don't have a cell phone.

358
00:14:00.526 --> 00:14:02.964
And I mean, I value my private time.

359
00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:05.527
The drive time is private time for me.

360
00:14:05.527 --> 00:14:08.372
But there are good reasons to not have them.

361
00:14:08.372 --> 00:14:11.599
For me, the health is the least of those reasons.

362
00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:13.712
From my perspective, it's the privacy question.

363
00:14:13.712 --> 00:14:15.314
<v Voiceover>Which is what I was going to ask you</v>

364
00:14:15.314 --> 00:14:17.747
right off of that as a matter of fact and I bet your kids

365
00:14:17.747 --> 00:14:20.883
don't carry any cell phones on them either. (laughs)

366
00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:23.472
<v ->You know, the privacy issue's a big deal.</v>

367
00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:24.505
<v Voiceover>This is a big deal.</v>

368
00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:25.782
Yeah, a lot of people are concerned

369
00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.753
with the fact that they're everyday citizens

370
00:14:27.753 --> 00:14:30.156
and not particularly concerned that they're doing anything

371
00:14:30.156 --> 00:14:31.491
that's questionable, but nonetheless,

372
00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:33.291
that there's a tracking possibility

373
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.392
for where you are every moment

374
00:14:35.392 --> 00:14:36.596
when you have your cell phone on you.

375
00:14:36.596 --> 00:14:40.436
<v ->Absolutely, these phones are now built with GPS system,</v>

376
00:14:40.436 --> 00:14:41.840
geographic positioning systems,

377
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.045
so you can be located easily in case of an emergency,

378
00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:46.600
as the storyline goes,

379
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.384
but the reality is every time you make the call,

380
00:14:49.384 --> 00:14:51.938
every time that you're on the line,

381
00:14:51.938 --> 00:14:54.318
when you register the call it's who called,

382
00:14:54.318 --> 00:14:57.487
where you called, and where you were when you called.

383
00:14:57.487 --> 00:14:59.484
So in case of criminal investigations,

384
00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:00.785
in Switzerland and other places,

385
00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:03.594
they have used this data and been able to go backwards

386
00:15:03.594 --> 00:15:05.881
and then trace all of your movements.

387
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:08.261
And you may not feel like, you know as they say,

388
00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:10.061
well if you don't have anything to hide,

389
00:15:10.061 --> 00:15:11.501
what are you worried about?

390
00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:13.892
The worry is who's deciding.

391
00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:15.808
You know, this is the same question that was raised

392
00:15:15.808 --> 00:15:18.037
when Adolf Hitler marched through Germany and Europe

393
00:15:18.037 --> 00:15:20.008
was if you don't have anything to hide.

394
00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:24.210
The fact of the matter is those in charge have no right

395
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.612
to penetrate our personal privacy in that way.

396
00:15:27.612 --> 00:15:30.256
I mean, why should our movements be tracked?

397
00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:32.219
Why should that data be collected?

398
00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:33.089
And the reason it is

399
00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:35.318
is because it can be, it's cheap,

400
00:15:35.318 --> 00:15:37.397
data storage is cheaper and cheaper and cheaper

401
00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:40.726
so longer and longer amounts of communication

402
00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:42.189
records can be kept

403
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:45.196
and ultimately this integrates into what turns into

404
00:15:45.196 --> 00:15:47.239
a much more directive and controlled society,

405
00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:49.898
which is, you know, when you start jumping into these issues

406
00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:52.638
you start looking at how does technology integrate,

407
00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:54.576
what do those integrations do,

408
00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.943
and how does that change how we're perceived

409
00:15:57.943 --> 00:15:59.278
and what's happened,

410
00:15:59.278 --> 00:16:01.519
cell phones as a small little niche in this,

411
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.783
we become increasingly transparent

412
00:16:03.783 --> 00:16:07.123
as human beings in technological societies.

413
00:16:07.123 --> 00:16:08.691
Well at the same time, our governments

414
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:10.920
and those organizations that regulate us

415
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.464
become more and more opaque.

416
00:16:12.464 --> 00:16:16.133
Just the opposite of what ought to be occurring.

417
00:16:16.133 --> 00:16:18.431
<v Voiceover>And people have read about cases</v>

418
00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:20.904
where it's been admitted into evidence

419
00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:22.167
shopping records, for example,

420
00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:23.444
through our convenience cards

421
00:16:23.444 --> 00:16:26.207
because those records are also made available

422
00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:28.738
in case of say a criminal investigation.

423
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.652
So and this we've known about for awhile.

424
00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:32.744
We know about the cell phones.

425
00:16:32.744 --> 00:16:35.751
What other kind of technologies are being employed

426
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:39.884
that are, in essence, invading our rights to privacy

427
00:16:39.884 --> 00:16:41.857
and what's coming down the pike?

428
00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:44.818
<v ->Well this is, you know to me, these are the big issues.</v>

429
00:16:44.818 --> 00:16:46.861
I mean, as we start to look at personal privacy

430
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:50.170
and technology, you can think about transaction tracking

431
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.436
like what we're talking about here.

432
00:16:51.436 --> 00:16:52.771
You know, your little discount card,

433
00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:54.698
all your credit cards, your medical records,

434
00:16:54.698 --> 00:16:57.066
your utility bills, your passport information,

435
00:16:57.066 --> 00:16:59.806
your driver's license, your real estate transaction.

436
00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:02.941
I mean, think of all of the things that we do as individuals

437
00:17:02.941 --> 00:17:05.547
that ultimately makes it into somebody's database.

438
00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:09.518
What these databases turn into is giant data banks.

439
00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:11.213
You know, one of the big ones that just got nailed

440
00:17:11.213 --> 00:17:13.384
for losing a bunch of records, ClearPoint,

441
00:17:13.384 --> 00:17:15.718
you know, and this is because they maintain

442
00:17:15.718 --> 00:17:18.794
billions and billions of records on individuals

443
00:17:18.794 --> 00:17:21.627
so that you can use it for what's called soft intelligence

444
00:17:21.627 --> 00:17:23.729
or what the Europeans now call,

445
00:17:23.729 --> 00:17:25.830
in the European Parliament, dataveillance

446
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:29.034
where they review the data as a method of surveillance

447
00:17:29.034 --> 00:17:30.973
to determine a whole lot about individuals.

448
00:17:30.973 --> 00:17:33.411
You know, you just talk about racial profiling.

449
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:37.579
This is, you know, a leapfrog way above that.

450
00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:40.052
This is looking at all transactions

451
00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.654
and drawing assessments from them.

452
00:17:41.654 --> 00:17:44.151
And that same company actually signed contracts

453
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.554
in the late '90s with the Department of Justice

454
00:17:46.554 --> 00:17:49.154
to be available as a source material

455
00:17:49.154 --> 00:17:51.221
for developing that kind of soft intelligence

456
00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:54.762
for criminal investigation and those kinds of uses.

457
00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:56.631
<v Voiceover>Is this information used for</v>

458
00:17:56.631 --> 00:18:00.068
anything beyond gathering criminal intelligence?

459
00:18:00.068 --> 00:18:01.867
<v ->Well you know, under the Patriot Act and the kind of</v>

460
00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:04.433
legislations that have been passed since 9/11,

461
00:18:04.433 --> 00:18:07.638
you know, we took this issue on pre 9/11

462
00:18:07.638 --> 00:18:10.038
and we published a book about this,

463
00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:11.512
"The Earth Rising: The Revolution,"

464
00:18:11.512 --> 00:18:13.509
to talk about all these kinds of issues

465
00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:14.519
and sort of their impact

466
00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:16.783
and predicting, you know, what will happen if.

467
00:18:16.783 --> 00:18:19.953
When 9/11 happened, everything of course changed

468
00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:22.786
and the what-ifs became the here and now.

469
00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:25.967
And so when you talk about these kind of technologies

470
00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:30.228
there tends to be more willingness to accept

471
00:18:30.228 --> 00:18:32.329
these kinds of invasive technolgies

472
00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:34.140
in terms of our personal privacy

473
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.439
in exchange for what we think is safety and security.

474
00:18:36.439 --> 00:18:39.202
So you see large changes happening

475
00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.012
in the area of biometrics, you know,

476
00:18:42.012 --> 00:18:46.052
which used to be just we thought of IDs as thumbprints.

477
00:18:46.052 --> 00:18:48.618
Now, biometrics extends to anything unique

478
00:18:48.618 --> 00:18:50.452
to your own biology.

479
00:18:50.452 --> 00:18:52.786
For instance, your iris is unique as a thumbprint

480
00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:56.420
so an iris scan can give you the same kind of information,

481
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.184
positive ID is what it boils down to.

482
00:18:58.184 --> 00:18:59.798
Heat emanations from the face

483
00:18:59.798 --> 00:19:01.801
are as unique as your thumbprint.

484
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.901
The idea of a voice print, five to 20 seconds of your voice

485
00:19:04.901 --> 00:19:08.369
is as unique as your thumbprint.

486
00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:11.109
<v Voiceover>Where is this information being harvested?</v>

487
00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.744
<v ->Well I think, you know, when you look at</v>

488
00:19:13.744 --> 00:19:14.940
first of all the systems.

489
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.040
This is a big, how do you collect all this data?

490
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.780
You know, when you go back, you gotta go back a little bit

491
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.742
and we gotta talk about a project that began

492
00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:25.714
just after World War II and it was the Echelon program,

493
00:19:25.714 --> 00:19:27.119
which involved five countries.

494
00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:29.662
It was the United States, Canada, Great Britain,

495
00:19:29.662 --> 00:19:31.194
Australia, New Zealand,

496
00:19:31.194 --> 00:19:33.528
and what we did is we agreed after World War II

497
00:19:33.528 --> 00:19:36.430
to exchange what was called then signal intelligence,

498
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:37.696
you know, radio broadcast.

499
00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:38.938
Telephone was kinda new,

500
00:19:38.938 --> 00:19:40.970
it wasn't in every house in those days.

501
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.440
But to use each other to survey each other's populations

502
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.238
so we wouldn't violate our own domestic laws,

503
00:19:48.238 --> 00:19:50.049
or in the United States, our Constitution,

504
00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:52.742
'cause you just couldn't go out and on a wholesale basis

505
00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:55.424
survey everybody, but the Canadians could do it

506
00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:57.386
and provide the data to our security agencies,

507
00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:59.418
which is exactly what has transpired.

508
00:19:59.418 --> 00:20:02.355
There's an article, November 2003,

509
00:20:02.355 --> 00:20:06.628
in all places, National Geographic that lays this out.

510
00:20:06.628 --> 00:20:09.298
We laid it out three years before in our earlier work,

511
00:20:09.298 --> 00:20:12.096
but it's nice to see it in a mainstream publication.

512
00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:13.501
And they talk about Echelon,

513
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:15.742
they talk about the idea of analyzing that data

514
00:20:15.742 --> 00:20:17.367
and here's been the problem.

515
00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:20.536
For the NSA, which does it on the United States' side,

516
00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:24.147
it's been how do you get all the electronic communications?

517
00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:26.748
You know, we're talking about telephones,

518
00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:28.420
faxes, Internet,

519
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.183
I mean just think of all the ways that people communicate.

520
00:20:31.183 --> 00:20:33.691
How do you pick out all those billions

521
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.222
of individual communications and sort it?

522
00:20:36.222 --> 00:20:38.288
Well supercomputers do the first job

523
00:20:38.288 --> 00:20:40.622
and they do it with the establishment first

524
00:20:40.622 --> 00:20:41.992
of what are called dictionaries.

525
00:20:41.992 --> 00:20:44.093
Now, dictionaries as you and I think about them

526
00:20:44.093 --> 00:20:46.502
are little books with words in them.

527
00:20:46.502 --> 00:20:48.232
The way these agencies think about them

528
00:20:48.232 --> 00:20:50.867
is it's that plus word phrases,

529
00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:53.213
voice information, voice print information.

530
00:20:53.213 --> 00:20:55.209
You know when Osama bin Laden goes on the phone

531
00:20:55.209 --> 00:20:57.404
and they say, or does a press conference

532
00:20:57.404 --> 00:20:58.681
that they try and interpret,

533
00:20:58.681 --> 00:20:59.981
they say it takes weeks to figure out.

534
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:01.746
It doesn't, it takes seconds.

535
00:21:01.746 --> 00:21:03.685
They know immediately who it is.

536
00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:05.647
That's why he got rid of all forms

537
00:21:05.647 --> 00:21:09.188
of electronic communication before he hit the trail

538
00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:10.488
and that's why we can't find him.

539
00:21:10.488 --> 00:21:13.298
There's no electronic signature to go after

540
00:21:13.298 --> 00:21:15.759
because he's not on the grid so to speak.

541
00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:18.267
By the same token, when you look at

542
00:21:18.267 --> 00:21:21.564
sort of the invasiveness of all this and where it heads,

543
00:21:21.564 --> 00:21:23.433
there was a paper put together, it was called

544
00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:25.010
"The Revolution in Military Affairs

545
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.114
"and Conflict Short of War" and it was 1989 or '90

546
00:21:28.114 --> 00:21:30.007
by the U.S. Army War College

547
00:21:30.007 --> 00:21:33.385
and it was, you know, that's a really good institution

548
00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:36.183
in terms of laying doctrine out for military training

549
00:21:36.183 --> 00:21:37.588
and leaders that are coming.

550
00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:40.491
And they looked at all of these technologies

551
00:21:40.491 --> 00:21:45.065
and much, much more as a change that was so profound

552
00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:46.319
in terms of what was happening.

553
00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:48.722
They equated the changes in military technologies

554
00:21:48.722 --> 00:21:52.368
from the days of gunpowder being introduced

555
00:21:52.368 --> 00:21:53.691
into Europe in the Middle Ages

556
00:21:53.691 --> 00:21:56.269
or that atomic weapons of the last century,

557
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:59.009
those are the kind of changes that they say are coming

558
00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:01.342
based on electromagnetic systems

559
00:22:01.342 --> 00:22:03.711
for surveillance and offensive weaponry.

560
00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:06.346
So when you talk about sort of where does it go,

561
00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:07.681
what they said in this

562
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:09.655
was there were several things that we could do

563
00:22:09.655 --> 00:22:13.544
that would increase our capacity as a country militarily,

564
00:22:13.544 --> 00:22:16.354
but these things would run counter to American values.

565
00:22:16.354 --> 00:22:18.629
One of the examples that was given within this paper

566
00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:20.824
was microchip technology

567
00:22:20.824 --> 00:22:22.728
that could be embedded in service personnel

568
00:22:22.728 --> 00:22:25.828
that would be used in '89 and '90 for just GPS,

569
00:22:25.828 --> 00:22:27.894
for locating them in the battlefield.

570
00:22:27.894 --> 00:22:30.274
And you know, if you were going in the battlefield

571
00:22:30.274 --> 00:22:31.238
you might want that.

572
00:22:31.238 --> 00:22:33.212
I mean, if you were going in and you got captured

573
00:22:33.212 --> 00:22:35.371
or got hurt and you wanted to be extracted

574
00:22:35.371 --> 00:22:38.413
and found rapidly, you know, this would be ideal.

575
00:22:38.413 --> 00:22:41.013
So in that sense, if you had a vote on it,

576
00:22:41.013 --> 00:22:42.813
that would be great, but as we know in the military

577
00:22:42.813 --> 00:22:44.276
you don't get votes, you get orders

578
00:22:44.276 --> 00:22:46.157
so everybody does what they're told.

579
00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:48.107
The problem is they didn't stop there.

580
00:22:48.107 --> 00:22:49.651
They suggested that this be installed

581
00:22:49.651 --> 00:22:52.658
in every business traveler because it's a volatile world,

582
00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:54.597
but don't worry, they won't turn them on

583
00:22:54.597 --> 00:22:57.337
unless there's a problem is what they said.

584
00:22:57.337 --> 00:23:00.205
The problem with all of that is it really runs counter

585
00:23:00.205 --> 00:23:04.195
to how Americans and most free peoples feel

586
00:23:04.195 --> 00:23:06.912
about their government's ability to monitor activity,

587
00:23:06.912 --> 00:23:09.245
although already in the Attorney General's office

588
00:23:09.245 --> 00:23:13.646
in Mexico City, they have installed 200 people

589
00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:15.584
with microcircuits to track their movements.

590
00:23:15.584 --> 00:23:20.584
This was major media in the last year, has come out,

591
00:23:20.623 --> 00:23:23.758
and they'd like to have their entire bureaucracy chipped

592
00:23:23.758 --> 00:23:24.988
for tracking purposes.

593
00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:27.868
The places it also comes up is with elders

594
00:23:27.868 --> 00:23:30.526
who are losing mental faculties for keeping track of them,

595
00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:33.359
children because of fear of kidnapping,

596
00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:35.774
prisoners on parole instead of ankle bracelets,

597
00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:37.574
sex offenders for life so you can track

598
00:23:37.574 --> 00:23:40.047
where they're at, where they've been all their lives.

599
00:23:40.047 --> 00:23:41.974
And many people would go, "You know,

600
00:23:41.974 --> 00:23:45.214
"those would be alright applications," at least today.

601
00:23:45.214 --> 00:23:49.614
Pre 9/11, nobody believed that.

602
00:23:49.614 --> 00:23:51.088
<v Voiceover>Right, that's true.</v>

603
00:23:51.088 --> 00:23:54.188
And so now the government can have the media

604
00:23:54.188 --> 00:23:55.187
throw up an orange alert

605
00:23:55.187 --> 00:23:57.462
and everybody says, "I'll do it, I'll do it."

606
00:23:57.462 --> 00:23:58.124
Is that what's going on?

607
00:23:58.124 --> 00:23:59.459
<v ->That's exactly what's going on</v>

608
00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:01.630
and here's what this paper said.

609
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.370
This paper projected that the only way

610
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.831
that these technologies and many others that they referenced

611
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.268
could be advanced, would be a change in American values.

612
00:24:10.268 --> 00:24:12.811
And they believe that the only way those values would change

613
00:24:12.811 --> 00:24:15.980
is in an environment of fear stimulated by two things:

614
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.408
international terrorism

615
00:24:17.408 --> 00:24:19.146
and in international drug trafficking.

616
00:24:19.146 --> 00:24:19.947
<v Voiceover>When was this written?</v>

617
00:24:19.947 --> 00:24:21.178
<v ->'89.</v>

618
00:24:21.178 --> 00:24:22.176
'89 or '90.

619
00:24:22.176 --> 00:24:24.522
But in any case, you can see it referenced in our work

620
00:24:24.522 --> 00:24:26.414
and the point of the matter is

621
00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:28.887
look at what's happened since 9/11.

622
00:24:28.887 --> 00:24:31.488
Look at the PSAs, the public service announcements,

623
00:24:31.488 --> 00:24:34.495
that tie drug trafficking and terrorism together,

624
00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:37.304
you know, that start to amplify that kind of fear.

625
00:24:37.304 --> 00:24:39.231
One of the things in that paper that it said

626
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:41.762
that was highly disturbing was the idea that

627
00:24:41.762 --> 00:24:43.570
we could use this intelligence

628
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.078
and maybe combine it with other technologies

629
00:24:46.078 --> 00:24:47.808
and knock an aircraft out of the sky

630
00:24:47.808 --> 00:24:50.745
that was carrying suspected terrorists, for example.

631
00:24:50.745 --> 00:24:53.311
So we'd knock it out of the sky, it'd crash,

632
00:24:53.311 --> 00:24:54.449
and when you looked at all of it

633
00:24:54.449 --> 00:24:56.109
it would look like pilot error.

634
00:24:56.109 --> 00:24:57.676
And the argument was made that maybe

635
00:24:57.676 --> 00:24:59.882
the Constitution stopped at the doorstep

636
00:24:59.882 --> 00:25:03.156
of the United States and didn't carry beyond our boundaries.

637
00:25:03.156 --> 00:25:05.293
Now, there's nobody that I have met

638
00:25:05.293 --> 00:25:07.057
along the road of life that believes

639
00:25:07.057 --> 00:25:10.262
that our military drops the Constitution at the door.

640
00:25:10.262 --> 00:25:12.804
Quite the contrary, it goes with them.

641
00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:14.066
Those are the values that we expect them

642
00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:15.668
to carry, not forget.

643
00:25:15.668 --> 00:25:17.770
Now, this was actually, it actually happened,

644
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.278
that the NSA provided the Peruvian Air Force,

645
00:25:20.278 --> 00:25:23.215
less than a year ago, information and intelligence

646
00:25:23.215 --> 00:25:26.477
on a drug trafficking air craft.

647
00:25:26.477 --> 00:25:28.846
The Peruvian Air Force went up, shot the air craft down

648
00:25:28.846 --> 00:25:30.947
and it contained a couple of missionaries,

649
00:25:30.947 --> 00:25:33.083
not drug traffickers at all.

650
00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:35.080
So the problem they predicted could happen,

651
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.286
which is downing the wrong air craft,

652
00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:39.562
did happen and there was no deniability.

653
00:25:39.562 --> 00:25:41.466
The United States was culpable,

654
00:25:41.466 --> 00:25:43.765
but nobody's been held responsible.

655
00:25:43.765 --> 00:25:46.330
So we are already engaged in the violation

656
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.467
of our own sense of right and wrong because

657
00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:52.135
all these things violate basic constitutional previsions

658
00:25:52.135 --> 00:25:54.411
like a presumption of innocence,

659
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:58.295
a jury, a judge, and an outcome.

660
00:25:59.914 --> 00:26:04.914
<v Voiceover>Well, none of it sounds to bode well right now.</v>

661
00:26:04.953 --> 00:26:08.424
From a consumer, an advocate, point of view

662
00:26:08.424 --> 00:26:09.991
what can the average person do

663
00:26:09.991 --> 00:26:14.498
in terms of protecting themselves in any way?

664
00:26:14.498 --> 00:26:15.926
Other than not having a cell phone,

665
00:26:15.926 --> 00:26:17.700
but it sounds like that's really just

666
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.499
a drop in the large bucket

667
00:26:19.499 --> 00:26:22.994
where these invasions of our personal rights

668
00:26:22.994 --> 00:26:24.198
seem to be taking place.

669
00:26:24.198 --> 00:26:27.031
<v ->Absolutely, you know, the key elements are several.</v>

670
00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:29.248
Firstly, you know, the idea of educating the public

671
00:26:29.248 --> 00:26:30.873
on what these technologies do.

672
00:26:30.873 --> 00:26:33.381
Technology generally doubles about every 10 months,

673
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:35.645
from the invention of the wheel to where we are today.

674
00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:38.048
So it becomes extremely important

675
00:26:38.048 --> 00:26:40.858
that technological issues get some public debate.

676
00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:43.180
One of the roles that we played in the last 11 years

677
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.593
is to try and force that debate, to bring information out,

678
00:26:46.593 --> 00:26:49.020
working with over 200 radio and TV producers

679
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.668
around the world,

680
00:26:50.668 --> 00:26:53.107
we continue to take the information forward,

681
00:26:53.107 --> 00:26:55.928
build our databases and get the information out,

682
00:26:55.928 --> 00:26:58.169
hoping that we could see the political changes

683
00:26:58.169 --> 00:27:00.537
that are necessary to properly regulate

684
00:27:00.537 --> 00:27:02.337
and protect the values that Americans

685
00:27:02.337 --> 00:27:05.413
and other free peoples around the world hold in common.

686
00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:07.851
And that ultimately is the first step

687
00:27:07.851 --> 00:27:08.780
in the right direction.

688
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.205
It has to be education followed by political action

689
00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:14.527
that restrains and constrains industry

690
00:27:14.527 --> 00:27:17.464
from abusing power that technology today offers.

691
00:27:17.464 --> 00:27:20.088
And you know, in all of our work what we have found

692
00:27:20.088 --> 00:27:24.024
is the abuses of technology, the abuses of power,

693
00:27:24.024 --> 00:27:26.334
are not based on some sinister viewpoint

694
00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:29.237
held by a few, but based on the concepts

695
00:27:29.237 --> 00:27:31.036
that their ideas are important,

696
00:27:31.036 --> 00:27:32.511
they want to further their ideas

697
00:27:32.511 --> 00:27:34.345
and they're using technology to do it.

698
00:27:34.345 --> 00:27:37.283
And sometimes people get a little zealous (laughs)

699
00:27:37.283 --> 00:27:39.314
and I think whether you're from the left or the right,

700
00:27:39.314 --> 00:27:40.510
the temptation.

701
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.751
Zbigniew Brzezinski said it in "Between Two Ages,"

702
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:44.376
a book he wrote in the early '70s,

703
00:27:44.376 --> 00:27:46.106
before he was National Security Advisor

704
00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:49.357
to Jimmy Carter, that as these technologies evolved

705
00:27:49.357 --> 00:27:51.458
that the left or the right would be tempted to use them

706
00:27:51.458 --> 00:27:52.991
to further their political ends

707
00:27:52.991 --> 00:27:54.558
and I think that's what we're seeing

708
00:27:54.558 --> 00:27:57.054
is these technologies are being used

709
00:27:57.054 --> 00:28:00.604
not just for political purposes, but for many purposes

710
00:28:00.604 --> 00:28:03.541
under the illusion of creating safety and security,

711
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:07.338
but what are we creating that safety and security for

712
00:28:07.338 --> 00:28:09.729
if it's not to maintain those basic values

713
00:28:09.729 --> 00:28:11.842
that have been the American character,

714
00:28:11.842 --> 00:28:14.849
that have been who we are as human beings?

715
00:28:14.849 --> 00:28:18.068
And that's what's missing in the equation.

717
00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:23.623
check out Dr. Begich's website

718
00:28:23.623 --> 00:28:24.993
and for those of you who are curious

719
00:28:24.993 --> 00:28:26.526
about the HAARP project,

720
00:28:26.526 --> 00:28:29.695
which Dr. Begich has spent so many years investigating,

721
00:28:29.695 --> 00:28:32.470
you'll also find the interview with Jerry E. Smith

722
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.165
quite an eye opener.

723
00:28:34.165 --> 00:28:38.229
Until next time, thanks for watching.
