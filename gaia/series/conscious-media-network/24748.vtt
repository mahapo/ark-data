>>If you're ready for a wild
ride and a hoot to boot,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll love this
close-up interview

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.730 align:middle line:90%
with Dannion Brinkley.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Whoever said lightning
never strikes twice

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:90%
was wrong, dead wrong.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.980 align:middle line:84%
The first time lightning
struck Dannion,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.100 align:middle line:84%
he was essentially
fried and lay dead

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
for 28 minutes,
sheet over his face,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:84%
before returning from
an incredible journey

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The second time, which resulted
in a near-death experience,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Dannion realized there
was a story to tell,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
a story that will
ensure that anyone who

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
is facing transition, which
will ultimately be all of us,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
will view the experience in a
much more embracing and loving

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
For many, his story actually
takes away the fear of dying.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.395 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, in 1975, I'd never heard
of the near-death experience.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody's legendary
book, Life After Life,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
had not been
produced or written,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and Raymond was still
doing his research.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was just living in
South Carolina growing up,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:84%
not very well,
I'd have to admit,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:84%
because my basic
character nature was

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
you dealt with everything by
popping it in the face first.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that that was
really how it really worked.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I was just
talking on the telephone,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
just an average
day in September,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
a normal dog days, light
thunderstorms in the afternoon,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:90%
in South Carolina.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Nothing cosmic,
just a normal life

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
of someone growing up there.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.209 align:middle line:90%
I'm hit.

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking on the telephone,
I'm hit in the head

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
by a bolt of lightning
that goes down my spine,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:84%
enters my side of my
head goes down my spine,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
welds the nails of the heels
of my shoes to the floor.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Throws me in the air,
suspends me in the air,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and slams me back
down on the bed.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Dead for 28 minutes, completely
paralyzed for six days,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:84%
partially paralyzed for
seven months, two years

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to learn to walk
and feed myself.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered every
aspect of reality

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:90%
that is possible to conceive of.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.056 align:middle line:84%
I know pain, and anguish,
and suffering, and fear,

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and grief, and bereavement,
and depression.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:90%
25 years old, sent home to die.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I happened to have survived
a lightning strike,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
but that was nowhere near
the two opposite directions

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
my life was gonna take.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
One was remembering
the spiritual world

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that I had explored in two
years of lying in a bed,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:84%
humiliated and paralyzed,
never to be anything

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:90%
except a vegetable and a burden.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Those are two completely
different worlds, one waking

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.465 align:middle line:90%
and one in remembering.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
If I had not had
what happened to me

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
in the near-death experience
and the consequences

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
of that awareness, I
would have never lived

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
through getting up "from
the dead," quote unquote.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, this begs the question:
what was the experience,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:90%
and what were you shown?

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:90%
What did you experience?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking about
in that 28 minutes--

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>--that allowed you to,
basically, end up here today?

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>And to survive.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>To survive.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm lifted out of my
body, and I became aware

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was less interested in
the material, emotional world

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I just lifted up.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Once I'm on fire, I'm
burning, I can't move.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:90%
The next minute, I'm out of it.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm at peace.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Everything is cool.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.741 align:middle line:84%
I know this place better
than I know anywhere.

00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't have mattered
if I'd had been in hell.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It was that I wasn't
paralyzed, burning,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and on fire is the
first thing I noticed.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.144 align:middle line:90%
And I was safe.

00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:40.185 align:middle line:84%
I look around in this
blue-gray place, it's calm.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I see myself.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I watch people work on
me as though I'm just

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
looking at it as a movie that
I'm casually interested in.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.301 align:middle line:84%
You know, points
catch my attention,

00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's not really important.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.493 align:middle line:84%
>>When you say
people work on you,

00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:90%
are you talking about the EMTs?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>The EMS, the people, Sandy
and Tommy, Sandy my ex-wife

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:90%
and Tommy my friend, came over.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.749 align:middle line:90%
The paramedics came.

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
They called the parameds.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:90%
They came.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:90%
They worked on me.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:90%
They got me to the hospital.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't really
involved in all of that.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It was just
something to look at.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I was in a new place at a new
time with a new perspective,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and it was comfortable.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
And then I watched them, and
they load me in the ambulance,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and I follow myself
out to the ambulance.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I see raindrops on my face.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
I watch them close the doors.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.022 align:middle line:84%
And that's about all
I remember of that.

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you know, I hear
these sounds, these chimes,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:90%
these tones.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an onion, peeling
away the skin of an onion.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
I could feel myself start to
be pulled down this tunnel.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I go down
this tunnel, I'm

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
peeling away parts
of me, good things.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
I become lighter.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I come into this place
of light, and it's brilliant

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's beautiful, and it's
dazzling in its wonderment.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But what was so amazing
about it, Regina, was this.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
The lightning had
burnt my eyes so bad,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't really see the flash.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But after I got out of my
body, I could see very well.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And this light did
not hurt my eyes.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:90%
It did not burn my eyes.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It is though it infused into me.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was not like
smoke but like a mist,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:84%
like on a early fall
morning in the South

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
when you see the mist come
over the-- the blue-silver mist

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And then this being appeared.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And this being was a sense
of all knowing and safety

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and wonderment, but it was
like an old friend, too.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that being that
we all meet is our true selves.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And they call it God,
Buddha, Mohammad,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:90%
whatever the name you call it.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It's really the true
part of you that

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
never left that realm
we call the heavens.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I experienced
this, I watched it,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and then, all of
a sudden, I began

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to feel childlike emotions that
grew into psychologies, that

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
became a complete
panoramic life review.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
My life passed before me
in 360-degree, holographic

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:90%
panorama.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I felt every emotion, every
scent, every smell, every idea,

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:90%
every concept.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But what was so dazzling
is that I comprehended it.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It was as though I knew
everything about all of it.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I watched it from a
second person point of view,

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:90%
like we watch our friends.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I literally
became every person

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:90%
I had ever encountered.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I felt the direct results
of my interaction between me

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and each of those people.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the
time, people freak out

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
when I tell them that, because
they start to think about all

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
the bad they've ever
done in their life,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:90%
and they're going to feel it.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you think about
how many good things

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:90%
you do each and every day.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the little
simple things, when

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.692 align:middle line:84%
you say hello that
means something

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual world.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>And you saw everything
in that degree

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.745 align:middle line:84%
of depth, even the
tiniest moments?

00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>The tiniest moment.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
The wisp, an eye
view, an eye sight,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:90%
passing someone in a corridor.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you don't miss a thing.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It is amazing that you have
missed nothing about this life.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You have experienced every
scent, every fragrance,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:84%
every view, every point,
every laughter, every frown,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
every smile, every
compassionate point.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And you understand
it, and you relive it.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you watch it and become
every person you've ever

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
encountered, you have
done far more good

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever done bad.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.785 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:31.535 align:middle line:90%
You know, I know--

00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.285 align:middle line:84%
>>Because you were
used to popping people.

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>I know the game.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And I got to see-- you know,
it was pretty rotten stuff,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
but I had to look at it and
to understand that there's

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
fairness, and there's justice,
and there's righteousness,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.975 align:middle line:84%
and that things are
truly in order, where

00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't have
any fear of death.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop all that and
really empower ourselves.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
most important part

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
was, one of the most
important parts,

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:90%
was the system of judgment.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
After I had this
panoramic life review,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:90%
there was a system of judgment.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Who judges you?

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:84%
What is amazing is no one
is more critical of yourself

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:90%
than you are of yourself.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
You will judge you
with such precision.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
No god could ever
do it that precise.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
No devil could ever do
it that precise as you.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to think about it,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the way you would interpret
it-- and this is a Dannionism

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
because we all have our own
ways of explaining what we think

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
is or is not-- but the
system of judgment,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:90%
as I would perceive it, is this.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
If God couldn't come
today and God sent you,

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
in the life you just reviewed,
what difference did God make?

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
That defines our
divinity, point blank.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We represent, in
an unfolding world,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:90%
the difference that God makes.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.925 align:middle line:84%
And when you stop
to think about that,

00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you smile a lot more, tap
people on the back a lot more.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:90%
You help a child.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
You become more patient
and more tolerant.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And like I always
say, I've worked

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
so hard at being
patient and tolerant

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
good at it at all.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I think my life mission is
just to be nice one day.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And if I can ever
just be nice one day,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I think I would have fulfilled
anything greater than getting

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
up from the dead, because
I can get up from the dead,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I just can't be nice all day.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.316 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody
will piss me off,

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and I will unload on
that sucker, you know.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Once a person sees
this, and remember,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been through it three
times, but once you see it,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%
there becomes a safety factor.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:90%
There is a life after death.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.868 align:middle line:84%
There's a way you
leave this world.

00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a way you review it.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a system of measurement
by which we all go through.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, this being
traveled with me,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff was
gone and it was over.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And we were like in
the expanses of when

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
you look at "Battlestar
Galactica" or "Star Trek."

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%
We're in the universe.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We're moving through the
dimensions and realities,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:90%
and you see these cities.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I always say it's like
pulling into Denver at night.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You see these houses all on
the sides of the mountains.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But these are crystal cities,
and there's so many of them.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Like "in my Father's house,
there are many mansions."

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.306 align:middle line:84%
It's not a little
biblical phrase.

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And you move toward these
crystal cities, and this being

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and I, and I entered
this crystal city.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But the coolest part was, as
I moved from the outer realm

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
into the portal that was into
this great cathedral made

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
of glass and crystal,
it was, for a moment,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer
Dannion Brinkley.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't that person anymore.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.257 align:middle line:84%
I was something more
divine and more truly me.

00:10:49.257 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have all the
opinions and attitudes

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:90%
of Dannion Brinkley.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And I distinctly remember
this, that I could conceive

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
of anything from a drop
of water to the expansion

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
and it was wild.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, I always thought
I was a know-it-all,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
but when you go to
heaven, you really

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:90%
find out you are a know-it-all.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wandering in
this place, these beings

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
appear, these
beings, and they're

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
like what honesty and integrity
and greatness and courage

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:90%
would symbolize.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And they appeared, and they
moved forward, and then

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
a 13th being, as
though they were

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in control of what
was about to happen.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And these boxes
of knowledge, what

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I say about and say
these beings seemed

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to become more radiant
than the others.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And I would only focus
like you and I are talking.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And then this box would come,
and it was like a box that

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
would open like a-- you
know , maybe I died and went

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:90%
to the Radio Shack.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And it would open, and
I would see an event,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.912 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know it was going
to be the future, Regina.

00:12:00.912 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any idea it
was going to be the future.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was 1975,
and this is 2005.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>What were you
seeing, and how is it

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
playing into today
all these years later?

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:90%
What was it you saw?

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:10%
I saw the events of where
we would be by 2004,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:10%
and I wrote it in
Saved by the Light.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:10%
It became what made me famous.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:10%
But watching the Chernobyl,
watching what pollution does,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.570 align:middle line:10%
watching war, watching the
Middle East, these things

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:10%
that I have foretold
are coming true.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It means this: that we have
entered a period of time

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:84%
where rapid growth
is going to occur.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You can never become
a great sea captain

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.515 align:middle line:90%
when you sail a calm sea.

00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You must be pushed
to explore the depths

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
of your joy, your sadness,
your compassion, your empathy,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and maybe sometimes
your sympathy.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And this period is
upon us, and it's

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
going to force us to reach to
the deepest depths of ourselves

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the highest standards
and goals of a spiritual being

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
that we possibly can.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The greatest thing you will
learn in the spiritual world

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
is that nothing is
written in stone.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Free will and choice, and making
the right ones change it all.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I went through these,
and they're all in those books,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in Chapter 5
in Saved by the Light,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
which I wrote 10 years
ago, I say exactly where

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the world is going
to be in 2004.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The border of a
war, the unfoldment

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of a great spiritual
advancement,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:90%
or some serious trouble.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Our choices are here.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Where we sit right now,
we make the choices

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of where the next
10 years will be.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It'll be good, it'll be
bad, but it's up to us.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And then I wanted to stay.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I never wanted to come back.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was the future.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I've just watched
it now for 30 years

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and lived with that knowledge.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.221 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to come back.

00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And if they'd had
given me a choice,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I would have never come back.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, I'm
floating above myself

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:90%
in a hospital room.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
intensive care.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd come through
the emergency room.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:90%
They lost me.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.622 align:middle line:90%
They covered me with a sheet.

00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:84%
They rolled me in a room because
they were busy that night,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're waiting to
take me to the morgue.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I just appear in the
hallway looking for me.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
First I've got to
find me, and then I

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out how to
get back in that body.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.025 align:middle line:84%
>>No instruction
manual for that?

00:14:30.025 --> 00:14:32.349 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I mean, would you
put something to heel?

00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many of you know
how to get back in a body?

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.231 align:middle line:90%
And how do you get a dead body?

00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at it, that
sucker was a little stiff.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.961 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to figure out,
how was I going to get in it?

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.302 align:middle line:90%
How was I going to make it work?

00:14:42.302 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And how was I going
to tell people,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know what to do.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
I'm back in this body.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not breathing.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm conscious, and I'm
aware, and I'm burning,

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:90%
and I'm on fire, and I hurt.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And that world
was fading really,

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
really fast that
I had just seen.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And the world of the reality
I was about to deal with

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
was on me, and I had to
figure out what to do.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled with all my
might to take a breath.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the emotions of
the people who were losing me,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
who thought I'd already gone:
my mom, my dad, my brother,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
sister, Tommy, the
closest people to me.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.556 align:middle line:84%
And this breath came in,
and I blew the sheet.

00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Whoo, whoo.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>What happened?

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Tommy saw it.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.859 align:middle line:90%
He started yelling.

00:15:30.859 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
like a horror movie.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was like Freddy
Krueger was waking up.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And they woke him
and got him going.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They pushed me back in there and
worked on me and got me stable.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And there began the
next four years.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
If I had not drifted between
this world and the world

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I had left, I would have
never found reason to survive.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
You cannot endure that kind
of lightning and that kind

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of power, that kind of damage,
and not have something to hold

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:90%
onto.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate it was
the near-death experience.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>In that original
lightning strike,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
did that set up
some situations that

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
were going to cause your next
three near-death experiences?

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:90%
So can you continue from there?

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess an extension
of that question is,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
did you continue in each
near-death experience

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
to be given more information and
go back to these beings again?

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The second time I got
struck by lightning

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
was just to get my attention.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I was struck by lightning
September the 17th

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
at 7:05 PM 1975 on a
Wednesday afternoon

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:90%
during a thunderstorm.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.984 align:middle line:90%
I never went back in that room.

00:16:39.984 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't get me
to go back in there.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I never went back in
there from that day

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:84%
forward, never, never
went back in there.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:90%
So I moved.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So in May of 1978, I was
in the bedroom talking

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
on the telephone, and I got
struck by lightning again.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about it.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can tell you--

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>What were you
doing right or not?

00:16:59.070 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>I got it.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Hey, stupid, you're
not paying attention.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:90%
We're going to kill you again.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make
it a coincidence so

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.204 align:middle line:84%
that when you tell
it to anybody,

00:17:12.204 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
look and realize

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that you're really dumb,
because there is absolutely

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.150 align:middle line:84%
no way this could
be a coincidence.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to kill you
exactly the same way doing

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.920 align:middle line:90%
the exact same thing.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
So there is a light-hearted
world of spirituality.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And I need people
to care more about

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that than I need them to
care about anything else.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this
interview, that they

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
feel the presence
of my relationship

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
with the spiritual world.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:90%
So they kill me, you know?

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they try to
teach me, and so they

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:90%
try to get me to do better.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have a way of
getting my attention.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>[LAUGHING] I'll say.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was all to
keep unfolding.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And in 1989, I
started feeling bad,

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.854 align:middle line:90%
and I knew something was wrong.

00:17:58.854 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But you know, like
most of us, you

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
don't want to pay
any attention to it.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't breathe, and I
lay on a bed for about two--

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:90%
on a couch for about two days.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to
go to the hospital.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So I went over to the hospital,
and I wrote my first book.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ever go
to an emergency room,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.595 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
insurance, you

00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:84%
will write a book
about your life.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And they rolled me
in the back room,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and this little
intern came in, looks

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
like he'd been working
about five days.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.365 align:middle line:90%
And he said, are you OK?

00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm in the hospital.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, what do you think?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.796 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't sit down because
I'm about to pass out.

00:18:41.796 --> 00:18:44.212 align:middle line:84%
He thought I had the flu because
it was the Hong Kong flu.

00:18:44.212 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
He'd treated 100
of them that day.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
He took my pulse and
my blood pressure.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:90%
His eyes got as big as saucers.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'll be
back in a minute."

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
He comes.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And here comes the
guys with this cart,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.711 align:middle line:84%
and these little green feeties
on, and this little hat,

00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and these little charred little
things you put on your chest.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Um, Mr. Brinkley?"

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Yeah?"

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Do you think I
should tell you the truth?"

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.525 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Fool, I just
paid $275 to come back here.

00:19:21.525 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I can get somebody
cheap-- I can get somebody

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
to lie to me a lot
cheaper than this.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I want to know."

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well," he said,
"you have congestion

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:84%
in your left lung," he said,
"but you're in heart failure.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:90%
You'll be dead in 45 minutes."

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Well, damn, Doc.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:90%
You reckon I ought to sit down?"

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's synchronize our watches.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Dead in 45 minutes,
what time you got?

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:90%
All right, looking good.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>He didn't know that that
was not a punishment for you.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>No, boy, we was on time.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.925 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
no way I was going

00:19:56.925 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
to come back down
the tunnel this time.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I'd already figured it out.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be cremated.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Because can't you
see me coming back

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.447 align:middle line:84%
into an urn on the
dresser at my house?

00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, can't you see
the people all out--

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Get rid of that body.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.878 align:middle line:84%
See the people all
out there in the yard,

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:90%
like we see visions of Mary.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But I want that-- I'm
gonna fry that body.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I want it cremated.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.151 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
no way-- you don't

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:84%
kill me two or three
times and think

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I won't figure out how to
get out of that situation.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, listen,
I'm out of here.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
They're shaving
the hair off of me.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I fall over, collapse.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a coma.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I come out of it.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.647 align:middle line:84%
They're shaving all
the hair off of me.

00:20:38.647 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to tell you, when
they do open-heart surgery,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.563 align:middle line:84%
they shave the hair
in a lot of places

00:20:42.563 --> 00:20:44.227 align:middle line:84%
you would never think
that they would.

00:20:44.227 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>That they need to.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.184 align:middle line:84%
>>And I asked this guy, I
said, what are you doing?

00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're prepping
you for open-heart surgery.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:90%
I said, where's my watch?

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%
What time is it?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Where's that lying doctor at?

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes I know has passed.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is me messing
with them because when

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
you know there's a
life after death,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
you have so much more
fun dealing with the pain

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and the suffering of it.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
an event, and Raymond

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:90%
came to see me, Dr. Moody.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, I'll stay.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I went in for
open-heart surgery.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I went under the mask.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I could describe
the conversations

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:90%
that went on during the surgery.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I watched it.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I floated above and
watched the surgery.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.766 align:middle line:84%
I watched them cut my
chest open, and open it up

00:21:29.766 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and take my heart out,
and cut my heart open.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty amazing,
modern-day equipment,

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and what they talk about in
an operating room as opposed

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
to what you think
they talk about.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Whoo.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
None of the doctors
wanted to mess with me

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:84%
after that because it's
amazing when you tell them

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
what they were talking
about, and you're supposedly

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%
not conscious.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing a lawsuit
coming down the pike.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>They're seeing their own
personal lives laid out

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:90%
in front of the world.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And I watched it.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.549 align:middle line:84%
And then chimes came, and I
moved back down the tunnel.

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I came into the place of light.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I had a second
panoramic life review.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:90%
It had been 14 years.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.865 align:middle line:84%
I saw how much
better I'd become.

00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been nice
all day yet, but I

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
had gone through a lot of
days where I almost was.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But I'd seen the difference
between the first experience

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and the second one, and
that's a place of empowerment.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
this crystal cathedral,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and I went into
this place that was

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:84%
a place that was
even more wondrous.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.075 align:middle line:84%
It was color and light and
essences and fragrances.

00:22:34.075 --> 00:22:36.385 align:middle line:90%
And it was a place where--

00:22:36.385 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
trying to show

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
me is that you can
build and create places

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth that meet
and live in harmony,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and that you can dwell, and
that the ever-present nature

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:90%
of spirit can be found.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Like what people
say churches do,

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and what great paintings do,
and what day spas are today,

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and what health spas, and
anti-aging, and all the things

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at today.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I saw it a long time ago.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways
in which that you

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
can move beyond the
physical and move

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:90%
into the emotional ethereal.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And this place I was
shown, what it had to do,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and how you had to do it,
and how you would create it,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:90%
and what it was about.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about
stress, and then I

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.171 align:middle line:84%
realized stress was the
number one killer, and just

00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:90%
the things.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It's so wondrous that,
in the other side,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
they know what's
going on, and they

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
tolerate us making
fools of ourselves.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And they laugh at us doing the
dumbest stuff in the world.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:90%
But they know.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.630 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
intercede or interject.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
They just support and try
to help us move through it.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:50.470 align:middle line:84%
For me, they get my attention
by killing me, which works.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the only
thing that would have worked.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, as
hard-headed as I am.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I And it's just the way I am.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
You kill me, and paralyze
me, and cut my heart out,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and drill holes in
my head, because

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:84%
after the open-heart
surgery, from complications

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of open-heart
surgery, I had to take

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Coumadin, which is rat poison.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.442 align:middle line:84%
And our blood gets
too thin or too thick,

00:24:11.442 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.524 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get
struck by lightning,

00:24:14.524 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
you have so many different
things that happen to you.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Being struck by
lightning is now,

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
in the National Institute
for Health's Office

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.597 align:middle line:84%
of Rare Diseases and
Disorders, called--

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
it's a rare disorder
called keraunomedicine.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Because people
have been-- because

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:84%
of neurocardiac--
cardiopulmonary resuscitation

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
in the neurocardiac
wards of hospitals,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:90%
you can bring people back.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So more people who are struck by
lightning are surviving today,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and we have become a science.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that makes me
babble on into shamanism

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and cultural shamanism and
people struck by lightning.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the lightning
shaman cultural history

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:90%
became real in my own life.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So after I went through
the-- I came back.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It took me nine months
of lying in the bed

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:90%
for open-heart surgery.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.490 align:middle line:84%
They gave me nine
months to live.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.165 align:middle line:84%
They said if I live,
they were going

00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to have to cut a
muscle out of my back,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
wrap it around my
heart, and I'd lose

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
60% of the movement on my
left side, but I'd be alive,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and I would have at
least 40% of a life,

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
dragging my left arm
and left leg around.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.746 align:middle line:84%
And that was supposed
to be impressive.

00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I just laughed.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.896 align:middle line:90%
Nine months, OK, I'll try it.

00:25:34.896 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm out of
here in nine months.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
You won't be wrapping any
muscle around my heart.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.705 align:middle line:90%
Forget that crap.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:90%
That's over.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Goodnight, Irene.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you turkeys later.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just smiled and
grinned and waited for me

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to get out of there.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And then seven years later,
I got on an airplane.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I had succeeded in
something that I

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:90%
believe is my life's work.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
According to the vision,
it had two steps,

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:90%
spiritualistic capitalism.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
An endeavour, a cause, something
grander than I could ever be

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that I could start, which
became The Twilight Brigade,

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest
end-of-life-care volunteer

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
programs for veterans
in American history.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We die with more
veterans, out of the honor

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that they came to defend our
will to be free Americans,

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
than any other
organization anywhere.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
And I started it.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I got on a plane to come home.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Because of Coumadin and
Tylenol, acetaminophen-- they

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:84%
didn't discover
until two weeks after

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that the two reacted
to each other.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:84%
They strip, somehow,
the blood vessels.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had three subdural
hematomas explode in my brain.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:90%
The first two exploded.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The first one exploded
in a 35,000 feet

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:90%
in a pressurized cabin.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what pain is
like in a pressurized cabin.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I got home.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And I got in, and the next
day my dad came to see me,

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:90%
and a friend, Mel, came over.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said take
me to the hospital.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.475 align:middle line:84%
I get to the hospital, they
couldn't stop the bleeding.

00:27:14.475 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It kept swelling.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:90%
My brain was swelling.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I was coming in and
out of consciousness.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said they had
to do brain surgery.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So on September the 17th at 7:05
AM 1997, 22 years and 12 hours

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.402 align:middle line:84%
to the day, to the
day, on a Wednesday

00:27:32.402 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:84%
morning during a
thunderstorm, they

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%
took me in for brain surgery.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.422 align:middle line:90%
Don't you love coincidences?

00:27:36.422 --> 00:27:37.255 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, coincidence.

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, Dan.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:90%
We're going to kill you again.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to kill
you with such style

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:84%
this time that no one will
get away with the fact

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.757 align:middle line:84%
that you're stupid, and
you're not listening.

00:27:49.757 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>And you still haven't
been nice for a whole day.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>And you haven't been
nice all day once.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Bam.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I go in to have brain surgery.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
They drills holes here
and here, and they

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:90%
start to relieve the pressure.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I spent 41 hours in recovery.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Then I had a massive
grand mal seizure,

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:90%
went into cardiac arrest.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.109 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And they brought me back.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I have worked harder at
being nice all day since '97

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.480 align:middle line:84%
than I have ever worked
at it before then.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult task, but,
you know, I'm still standing.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.595 align:middle line:84%
So what it all
really means is there

00:28:32.595 --> 00:28:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as
death, there's only life.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
We are powerful and
mighty spiritual beings.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We have destiny,
hope, a purpose.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We choose to come to this
world, and we're chosen to come.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And people just have
to accept it and quit

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:90%
getting in their own way.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when you give
up a part of yourself

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to buy into something
you know is wrong,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:84%
you sell a part of
yourself that blocks you

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.115 align:middle line:90%
from seeing who you are.

00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I've done it all my life.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.266 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting out of my way.

00:29:08.266 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:84%
The third near-death
experience, as you know,

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:90%
was the most awakening.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:90%
The first two were perfect.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everything was cool.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
If you can have a perfect
near-death experience,

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I had them.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
The third one was in
the brain surgery.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:84%
The place I went to was
the standard system,

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
except the blue-gray
place, the place

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought both the
other times I was alone,

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I wasn't,
because I was hanging closer

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:90%
to the body and to the hospital.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed longer.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I stayed longer in
this blue-gray place.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And I would look around,
and it was dimensions.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
There are worlds where
people get trapped.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I understand that now what
ghost, and poltergeist,

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and Earth-bounds, and
attachments, and possessions,

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and whole places where people
get depressed and don't

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:90%
know why.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there are levels
of energy around us, where

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
if we're not truly spiritually
grounded, we're trapped.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one of the most
important missions of my life

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
is to make people aware
of that and to create

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:84%
a way that would
support and help them.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I saw so many veterans
because they were in prison.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:90%
They died a horrible death.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.395 align:middle line:84%
There was things, and
they just couldn't let go.

00:30:32.395 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't go
down the tunnel.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't accept
what happened.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of abused people,
but a lot of abusers.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're all trapped
in there together,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:84%
going through the same
crap over and over

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.970 align:middle line:84%
again because they
refuse to let go.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Some don't think they deserve
it because of what they've done.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And some who won't do it
because they think they're

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
face themselves.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a
hodgepodge that's

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
not creating enough
spiritual groundedness in us

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:90%
to move forward.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
can create a stoppage,

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that the more people who
get trapped in that place,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:84%
the harder it is to get through
it to get to the tunnel.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So what compassion and action
is The Twilight Brigade is,

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
is a way to help veterans
on this side move

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
through that layer of
the blue-gray place

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:90%
and get to the other side.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And have those who've already
made it help their brethren

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.800 align:middle line:90%
to get across the Heavenly Host.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no such thing
as an atheist in a foxhole.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.445 align:middle line:84%
And in the combat
and the military,

00:31:36.445 --> 00:31:39.160 align:middle line:84%
you're just looking after
the guy next to you.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And that way, I can create
a bridge between this world

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.135 align:middle line:84%
and the next world, and
to help people, and hope

00:31:45.135 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to inspire people who deal in
abuse, who deal in not being

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:84%
nice, cynicism, these kinds
of things, to not be that way,

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:84%
or they'll just
get trapped there.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>So when it's
all said and done,

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:84%
from everything you've seen
now over the last 30 years,

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
what are the principle tenets
we should, as beings, adhere to?

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Number one, never lose
focus in your identity

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:90%
as a divine spiritual being.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Never allow anything
to take that focus.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:30.470 align:middle line:84%
You are a divine, powerful,
mighty spiritual being

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
with destiny, purpose,
and direction,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:90%
no matter what's going on.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:84%
96% of what's going on
around you, you created.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:84%
You did it to yourself
to help you grow, expand,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:90%
or understand some premise.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
The other 4% could have
had a little effect.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Somebody might have
kicked you, made you mad.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:90%
But 96% of it, you caused it.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Second, you choose to
come to this world,

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're chosen to
come to this world.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you were chosen, it
means that the divine force

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:90%
believes that you are the one.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And if the chances of someone
being exactly like you

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth is 1 in 16 billion,
and there's only 6 billion

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:90%
of us here, then you're the one.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And accept that you're
on a divine mission.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And every day, look at
it from, what difference

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.791 align:middle line:84%
can I make to improve
that quality of divinity?

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
God couldn't come
today, and God sent you.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.616 align:middle line:84%
In the life you just reviewed,
what difference did God make?

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You will be amazed at how more
insightful, how creative you

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.820 align:middle line:84%
are to improve it as opposed
to ignore it, hide from it,

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:90%
or walk away from it.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:90%
The other is the four-fold path.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I write about it in The
Secrets of the Light.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And as I write about it,
which is really Kathryn

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and I writing about
it, I mean, my wife

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is the brains behind
this whole operation.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
She's like, behind
every great man

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is a woman kicking his ass to be
the best that they can possibly

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But as we write about it,
there's the four-fold path.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.420 align:middle line:84%
There is choice: to know,
as a spiritual being,

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:90%
you have choice.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do good or right,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and nobody can do
anything about it but you.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But there are consequences
for your reaction.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But you have a choice and you
can choose to do greatness,

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.552 align:middle line:84%
or you can choose to do nothing,
or you can choose to do damage.

00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The universe does not
know the difference

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:90%
between right and wrong.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.460 align:middle line:90%
It does not, so you must.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Second, you must identify
love as the source

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
of all power, which is the
appreciation of everything

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:84%
around you, to observe it,
appreciate it, good or bad.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And look at those
things that you admire,

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.560 align:middle line:84%
because appreciation--
admiration

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
is constant appreciation
that becomes

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:90%
a mindset of what you admire.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And then see what you admire,
traits in other people.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And you will see the
traits in yourself

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:90%
that you want to improve.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Teach best what you
most need to learn.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I most need to learn to
be patient and caring and

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, so
I do hospice work.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Number three, belief.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Create a belief system so that
you have faith in humankind.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself in places
that you believe

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
in what is the
potential of humankind.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Because once you have
something you believe in,

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.380 align:middle line:84%
you have faith in other
people seeing it in you,

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and then recognize
it in themselves.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is that they
are a divine spark

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.090 align:middle line:90%
of the connectiveness of God.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:36:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And last, the true source of
your power, to use it, prayer.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Willful, conscious intent
that collectively together we

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:90%
can pray.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And in being able to do that,
using willful conscious intent,

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:84%
we are collectively, as one
consciousness, moving forward.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:90%
That's real power.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
If a person is either learning
about prayer, about belief,

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:28.340 align:middle line:84%
about love, and about choice,
or trying to teach it,

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.640 align:middle line:84%
you will find
harmony in your life.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
You're either teaching
it or trying to learn it,

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and that's the key.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And live a good life.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Be caring and compassionate.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Be respectful.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But more than
anything else, listen

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and seek to understand
where a person is

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.467 align:middle line:90%
so that you can help them.

00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll play the hand I'm dealt.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Because when you know don't
die, and you know you're loved,

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and you know you have
choice, and you have belief,

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can understand
love, and you

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.750 align:middle line:84%
have the potential of
the power of your prayer,

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and to collectively use
that with other beings,

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.940 align:middle line:90%
you can achieve anything.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.737 align:middle line:84%
And you just play
the hand you're dealt

00:37:15.737 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and be happy that you
have that opportunity.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.694 align:middle line:84%
>>It sounds like you were
dealt a pretty good hand.

00:37:19.694 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You have a wonderful
wife, a wonderful life.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
satisfaction of knowing

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that thousands,
millions of people

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:90%
have been helped by your words.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'm achieving the
centers and building

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Compassion in Action.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I hope it stands
as a symbol that there

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
is a life after death, and that
we are so truly loved, that you

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:84%
can stop and start
over any time you want,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can use the
four-fold path to do it.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that people
start today finding

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
something that they
care about and a cause.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
this show is over,

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:84%
look up what you can do to
change other people's lives,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to help those less fortunate,
and to find a cause as

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:84%
great as you can
live up to achieving.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens, the world
opens up to every opportunity.

>>As you can imagine,
Dannion is an incredibly

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:16.977 align:middle line:84%
entertaining and
inspiring speaker,

00:38:16.977 --> 00:38:18.685 align:middle line:84%
and I highly recommend
you try to see him

00:38:18.685 --> 00:38:20.350 align:middle line:90%
if he's lecturing in your area.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.530 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, he's written
three books, including

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
his latest, The
Secrets of the Light.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Visit his website
for more information.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, another
fascinating take

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
life after life

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:90%
is from Dr. Mitchell Gibson.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
While working as chief
resident of a hospital's

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:84%
psychiatric ward,
Dr. Gibson began

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.680 align:middle line:84%
seeing patients who had died
days, even weeks before,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
standing in the
hospital hallways

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and walking through walls.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:90%
This is an incredible interview.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.
