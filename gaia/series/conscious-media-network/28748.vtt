00:00:01.027 --> 00:00:02.223
<v ->I don't know about you,</v>

2
00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:05.091
but movies about everyday heroes make me cry.

3
00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:07.529
If a movie were made about the life of Judy Wicks,

4
00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.293
I would certainly be crying.

5
00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:12.603
This woman is a testament to what one person can do

6
00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:15.203
fueled by a social conscience and passion.

7
00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:17.347
As a conscientious cafe owner,

8
00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:19.493
Judy began seeing the interrelationship

9
00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:21.902
between everything she served in her restaurant

10
00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:23.632
and went to the ends of the earth to see

11
00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:25.234
the political ramifications

12
00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:28.055
of supporting certain commodity industries.

13
00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:30.644
She ultimately met with the Zapatistas in Mexico

14
00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:33.489
in an activist program she humorously called

15
00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.538
"Eating with the Enemy."

16
00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:38.777 line:15% 
(slow horn music)

17
00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:45.225
<v Blonde Woman>Judy, if you can give us</v>

18
00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:46.271
a little bit of background

19
00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:48.431
about your origins as an activist.

20
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:50.706
You did some really classic things in your youth.

21
00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:52.700
Why don't you just launch in?

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.649
<v ->Well, during the '60s, coming of age in the '60s,</v>

23
00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.351
I was very concerned about the Civil Rights Movement

24
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.890
and about protesting the Vietnam War.

25
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.203
But the first time I actually committed civil disobedience

26
00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:11.557
wasn't about the usual activist issues.

27
00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:14.761
I had moved onto a block in Philadelphia,

28
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.805
a block of Victorian brownstone houses

29
00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.359
that I just loved and on the first floor

30
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.576
were little businesses, there's a health food store

31
00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.694
on the first floor of my house, and then up the street,

32
00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:25.036
there was a locally owned restaurant

33
00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:28.043
where I had just gotten a job as a waitress.

34
00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:31.054
I was I would guess about 23 at the time.

35
00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:33.488
And just after I had moved in,

36
00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:36.872
I found out that the block was gonna be demolished.

37
00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:41.290
So I was really aghast that these beautiful brownstones

38
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.554
were being torn down and the small businesses

39
00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:46.509
evacuated in order to make way for a mall,

40
00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:49.931
fast food restaurants and chain stores.

41
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.645
I joined the community group to work

42
00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:56.139
to stop the demolition, and while we were

43
00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.426
preparing our court case,

44
00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:00.828
one morning I heard this rumbling in the back alley

45
00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:02.646
and I looked out my back window,

46
00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:05.851
and I saw this bulldozer coming up the alley

47
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.952
and then it rammed into the house behind me

48
00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:10.123
that had just been evacuated,

49
00:02:10.123 --> 00:02:12.689
the residents and businesses were evicted,

50
00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.092
and it was beginning to demolish the house.

51
00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:17.062
So I thought, "Oh my gosh!

52
00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:19.132
"They're at my door, McDonald's and Dunkin Donut

53
00:02:19.132 --> 00:02:20.560
"are at the door."

54
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.265
I ran outside, I ran around to the back.

55
00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:25.704
I yelled to one of the other

56
00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:27.399
community group members to call our lawyer

57
00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.908
to get a restraining order.

58
00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:30.533
And then I ran around and lay down

59
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:31.973
in front of the bulldozer

60
00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:33.505
to keep them from damaging the property

61
00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.394
until we could get a restraining order.

62
00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:37.861
Luckily, he stopped,

63
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:39.336
<v Blonde Woman>Thank goodness.</v>

64
00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:41.586
<v ->and our community group prevailed,</v>

65
00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:44.047
and I was able to buy the house

66
00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:45.650
where I was living.

67
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.529
And ten years later, started the White Dog Cafe

68
00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.992
on the first floor of my house.

69
00:02:49.992 --> 00:02:52.129
<v Blonde Woman>That's fabulous, I love your roots,</v>

70
00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.292
and that must have really emboldened you.

71
00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:56.034
Were you able to see in that moment,

72
00:02:56.034 --> 00:02:58.170
even though you were just reacting to the moment

73
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.996
on one level as a young woman activist,

74
00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:05.008
did it embolden you to start taking other steps in life

75
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:08.071
to realize that that bulldozer did stop

76
00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:12.696
and you were able to be effective in your cause?

77
00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.353
<v ->Yes, and I think it really was the first moment</v>

78
00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:17.826
where I realized how passionately I felt

79
00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:21.959
about protecting communities and small businesses

80
00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.413
from the onslaught of multinational corporations.

81
00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:27.299
And that was kind of the beginning

82
00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.203
of my passion around this area.

83
00:03:29.203 --> 00:03:30.631
<v Blonde Woman>And so you opened--</v>

84
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:32.288
it's White Dog restaurant or cafe?

85
00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:33.765
<v ->White Dog Cafe.</v>

86
00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:35.088
<v Blonde Woman>You opened the White Dog Cafe</v>

87
00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:37.340
and then, let's progress the story from there

88
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.210
of some of what you began encountering,

89
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.285
and I like this story, about your sister restaurant

90
00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:46.652
in Chiapas and also the coffee industry

91
00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:48.753
and what you were experiencing.

92
00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:51.708
'Cause this is a big one, even today this is big.

93
00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.142
<v ->I started the restaurant very small.</v>

94
00:03:54.142 --> 00:03:56.627
It was a coffee and muffin take-out shop

95
00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:58.357
without even any tables.

96
00:03:58.357 --> 00:04:02.281
I grew it over time into a 200-seat restaurant

97
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:06.228
with 100 employees, so it's really not a cafe anymore

98
00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:07.169
but rather a restaurant,

99
00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.888
but White Dog Cafe is the original name.

100
00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:15.614
Having been a peace activist in my youth

101
00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:17.425
and feeling that my government

102
00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.654
fooled me about Vietnam,

103
00:04:19.654 --> 00:04:22.358
many of my generation were killed

104
00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:24.038
in the war, of course,

105
00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:26.533
I was very dubious

106
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:30.993
of U.S. government foreign policy.

107
00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:34.933
When there was a civil war going on in Nicaragua,

108
00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:36.559
and the Reagan administration was saying,

109
00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.533
"Well, the Sandinistas are communists,

110
00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.634
"and the Contras are the freedom fighters,

111
00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:42.445
"you know that this is about

112
00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:44.999
"protecting democracy from communism."

113
00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.785
And at the time I was a pro-capitalist person,

114
00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:50.031
I was raised to fear the communists,

115
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:52.348
but I didn't know whether it was true or not.

116
00:04:52.348 --> 00:04:54.682
I said this time I was gonna find out for myself.

117
00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:56.075
I was thinking about, well,

118
00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:57.689
what makes sense for a restaurant

119
00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.674
to get involved with foreign policy?

120
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:02.623
I was trying to figure out how to make sense of this

121
00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:04.260
to my customers and so on,

122
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.723
and I heard about sister cities.

123
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:08.268
And I thought, well why not a sister restaurant program?

124
00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:10.660
I'll establish a sister relationship with

125
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.796
a restaurant in Nicaragua and ask them

126
00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:15.431
are they privately owned, the Sandinista communists;

127
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:17.068
what's happening?

128
00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.495
At first, it was gonna be a pen-pal relationship.

129
00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:21.573
And then a friend of mine was taking

130
00:05:21.573 --> 00:05:24.046
groups of people to Nicaragua, and he said,

131
00:05:24.046 --> 00:05:24.975
"Why don't you come down,

132
00:05:24.975 --> 00:05:26.612
"and find a sister restaurant yourself?"

133
00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:27.807
I said, "No way!"

134
00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:31.023
"I go upstairs to my house, downstairs to my business,

135
00:05:31.023 --> 00:05:34.202
"I've got a two-year-old and a four-year-old.

136
00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:36.822
"Especially I don't go to countries having civil wars.

137
00:05:36.822 --> 00:05:38.365
I'm not going!"

138
00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:41.415
Of course, a month later, I was in Nicaragua (laughs).

139
00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:43.138
<v Blonde Woman>Right, of course.</v>

140
00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:44.619
Couldn't help yourself.

141
00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:46.428
<v ->And it really changed my life,</v>

142
00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:50.101
to see how different the reality on the ground was

143
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:52.986
from what I was reading in the news back home.

144
00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.569
The need to let Americans know what our foreign policy

145
00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.924
was doing to the lives of people in other countries.

146
00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:00.830
So I started bringing in delegations.

147
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.349
I went to Nicaragua three times

148
00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.787
during the civil war there and so on.

149
00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:08.096
Then I went to Vietnam, a customer of mine was saying,

150
00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:10.964
"You should go to Vietnam because there's such

151
00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:17.643
"an inequity in U.S. foreign policy there."

152
00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:19.596
Because we're still continuing the Vietnam War

153
00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:22.882
through an economic embargo against Vietnamese people.

154
00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:25.541
I decide to go to Vietnam, and I would never

155
00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:26.841
have thought of that before,

156
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:29.744
I think of Vietnam as being a war.

157
00:06:29.744 --> 00:06:33.668
But in going, I now think of them as being a people

158
00:06:33.668 --> 00:06:35.723
and finding out--I could go on forever

159
00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:37.638
just about that experience or any of my trips,

160
00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:41.620
but anyway, I began to see in my travels,

161
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.211
I went to the Soviet Union, I went Cuba,

162
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.868
and I like to say we ate with the Sandinistas

163
00:06:46.868 --> 00:06:49.368
and the Zapatistas and the Cubans and the Soviets

164
00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:52.035
and the Palestinians, so our nickname

165
00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:54.136
for the program became "Eating with the Enemy."

166
00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:56.116
<v Blonde Woman>I love that!</v>

167
00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.072
<v ->Our purpose in the beginning was to</v>

168
00:06:58.072 --> 00:07:00.853
demonstrate that it's through dialogue and understanding

169
00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.646
that we achieve world peace, rather than

170
00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:05.839
through economic and military domination.

171
00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:09.390
But in my travels, I began to see

172
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.591
so much of what was happening around war

173
00:07:13.591 --> 00:07:17.370
was in fact about militaries protecting corporate interests.

174
00:07:18.923 --> 00:07:21.590
Because publicly traded companies have to grow grow grow,

175
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.013
that's their mandate, they have a constant need

176
00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:27.755
for new, cheap resources, natural resources,

177
00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:31.598
new access to cheap labor, and new markets

178
00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:34.011
to expand their business.

179
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.277
They need a military to protect that.

180
00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:38.539
I saw a quote one time from New York columnist

181
00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:41.582
Thomas Friedman, that we can't have McDonald's

182
00:07:41.582 --> 00:07:44.186
without McDonald Douglas,

183
00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:47.234
the defense contractor.
<v Blonde Woman>Very true.</v>

184
00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.938
<v ->I started seeing the relationship between war</v>

185
00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:52.913
and corporate interests, and began to see

186
00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:54.956
that it wasn't really a global struggle

187
00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:56.837
between communism and capitalism,

188
00:07:56.837 --> 00:07:59.996
but between a community and corporatism.

189
00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:02.433
<v Blonde Woman>Very, very good and clear distinction.</v>

190
00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:03.977
Everybody should underline that.

191
00:08:03.977 --> 00:08:05.680
<v ->Right, right, exactly.</v>

192
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.703
When the Zapatistas had their uprising

193
00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:11.579
on the the day that NAFTA went into effect,

194
00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:14.726
January 1, 1994,

195
00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:16.386
I was very interested in

196
00:08:16.386 --> 00:08:19.288
why this uprising, why on the day

197
00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:21.221
that NAFTA went into effect?

198
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:23.352
I went down there bringing a delegation

199
00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:25.835
of my customers to learn

200
00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:28.868
about the roots of the unrest

201
00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:32.396
and found that, in order to comply with NAFTA,

202
00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:35.345
the Mexican government had to change their constitution,

203
00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:37.806
and in particular, a part of that constitution

204
00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:41.672
that guaranteed the indigenous people

205
00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:45.283
access to their communal lands, for farming,

206
00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:49.056
that was communally owned land for the indigenous people.

207
00:08:49.056 --> 00:08:52.193
This was won by Zapata,

208
00:08:52.193 --> 00:08:55.337
one of the leaders in the revolutionary war.

209
00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:57.880
But to comply with NAFTA, they had to do away

210
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.621
with that part of the constitution

211
00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:02.895
and open these indigenous lands to privatization

212
00:09:02.895 --> 00:09:05.653
and exploitation by foreign corporations.

213
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.436
The Zapatistas predicted, accurately,

214
00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:14.563
that once the borders to Mexico were opened through NAFTA,

215
00:09:14.563 --> 00:09:17.245
that cheap corn subsidized by the U.S. government,

216
00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:18.720
grown by corporations in the U.S.,

217
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.752
would be dumped into Mexico,

218
00:09:20.752 --> 00:09:23.280
putting out of business the indigenous farmers.

219
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.616
And that's exactly what happened.

220
00:09:24.616 --> 00:09:26.717
It caused a mass migration to the United States

221
00:09:26.717 --> 00:09:30.534
as well as forcing Mexican farmers

222
00:09:30.534 --> 00:09:33.160
to take jobs on corporate plantations

223
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.098
or in the maquiladoras, the factories and so on.

224
00:09:36.098 --> 00:09:38.199
The Zapatistas were saying,

225
00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:40.138
"We want the right to farm our land.

226
00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:42.669
"We want the right to community self-reliance

227
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.411
"where we can grow our own food,

228
00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:47.870
"and live in peace and have autonomy."

229
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.413
And also to keep their culture,

230
00:09:50.413 --> 00:09:53.246
they wanted the right to maintain their culture,

231
00:09:53.246 --> 00:09:55.684
to teach their children in their own languages.

232
00:09:55.684 --> 00:09:58.041
They didn't want to be gobbled up by

233
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:01.952
the corporate, global mono-culture of the West.

234
00:10:02.983 --> 00:10:05.747
That was what the uprising was about.

235
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.722
I began to see the relationship between

236
00:10:09.722 --> 00:10:12.173
what was happening to the Zapatistas

237
00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:13.972
and the indigenous people in Mexico,

238
00:10:13.972 --> 00:10:15.934
to those farmers with what was happening

239
00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:19.069
to our farmers at home, that our farmers at home

240
00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:20.706
were being forced off the land

241
00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:25.052
by the same forces, the corporate forces, that were

242
00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:27.951
aided by the U.S. government

243
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:30.749
who provides these subsidies to our farm bill

244
00:10:30.749 --> 00:10:35.419
that create an unfair advantage to the large corporations.

245
00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:37.866
They get these millions and billions of dollars

246
00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:40.257
in subsidies, and the family farms don't.

247
00:10:40.257 --> 00:10:42.394
So we're losing our family farms,

248
00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:43.868
and the corporations are buying up the land

249
00:10:43.868 --> 00:10:46.880
and planting mono-crops for export.

250
00:10:47.804 --> 00:10:50.265
That's what really made me understand

251
00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:53.255
that we needed to create a new economy.

252
00:10:56.244 --> 00:10:59.681
What really triggered me to change my mission

253
00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:01.283
of my sister restaurant program

254
00:11:01.283 --> 00:11:04.116
was the Acteal massacre.

255
00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:05.780
I had just gotten a urgent email

256
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.785
from our sister restaurant in Chiapas

257
00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:10.884
saying that the paramilitaries,

258
00:11:10.884 --> 00:11:13.566
which are the armed forces of the landowners,

259
00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:15.853
were forcing the coffee-growers,

260
00:11:15.853 --> 00:11:18.441
the indigenous people, from their lands.

261
00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:21.029
They were became refugees,

262
00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:23.676
hiding out in the mountains and so on,

263
00:11:23.676 --> 00:11:24.872
and that she was really nervous

264
00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:26.207
that something bad was gonna happen.

265
00:11:26.207 --> 00:11:28.506
And days after that, there was the Acteal massacre

266
00:11:28.506 --> 00:11:32.062
where 45 unarmed, mostly women and children,

267
00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:34.571
in the coffee-growing of Chiapas,

268
00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:37.904
these people were massacred by the paramilitaries.

269
00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:40.859
I was really just struck by this, and thinking,

270
00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:42.686
"I want to do something."

271
00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:43.889
<v Blonde Woman>Now, these paramilitary,</v>

272
00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.172
are they contracted directly by the corporations?

273
00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.827
Or is it inclusion with the governments?

274
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.422
<v ->Both, from what I understand</v>

275
00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:54.996
that the paramilitaries

276
00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:57.845
began as forces to protect the land,

277
00:11:57.845 --> 00:11:59.540
the landowners, the wealthy landowners,

278
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.397
they're their own little militias.

279
00:12:02.397 --> 00:12:05.384
But most of the people in Chiapas,

280
00:12:05.384 --> 00:12:08.758
the progressive folks, feel that the Mexican army

281
00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:11.940
is actually providing guns to these paramilitaries,

282
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.122
that the paramilitaries do the dirty work

283
00:12:14.122 --> 00:12:17.419
that Mexican government doesn't want to do.

284
00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:19.323
It's sort of like how the United States

285
00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:22.957
provides arms for, say, the Salvadoran military

286
00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:26.776
back during that civil war rather than invading.

287
00:12:26.776 --> 00:12:29.235
That's one lesson that they learned, for a while anyway,

288
00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:30.910
about Vietnam is not to actually invade

289
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.216
and have our own troops go in--

290
00:12:32.216 --> 00:12:33.278
<v Blonde Woman>Just provide resources.</v>

291
00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:34.843
<v ->provide the resource and the guns</v>

292
00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:36.645
so that another army would do the work

293
00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:39.745
that, in the long run, protects not only U.S. corporations,

294
00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:43.541
but the large corporations of those lands,

295
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:47.096
the wealthy people of the Latin American countries.

296
00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:50.862
After the Acteal massacre, I really wanted

297
00:12:50.862 --> 00:12:52.650
to do something more, and I realized

298
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.485
that I had kind of run my course

299
00:12:54.485 --> 00:12:56.721
in terms of having my sister restaurant program

300
00:12:56.721 --> 00:12:59.129
be about dialogue and communication

301
00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:01.230
and educating the folks back home,

302
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.935
that I wanted to become an active participant,

303
00:13:03.935 --> 00:13:06.571
and to actually do something.

304
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:10.048
I was feeling kind of helpless, and what can I do?

305
00:13:10.048 --> 00:13:12.098
All of a sudden, I realize because people were saying

306
00:13:12.098 --> 00:13:13.711
that no one was listening about the violence

307
00:13:13.711 --> 00:13:15.754
that the peace activists were having demonstrations,

308
00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.284
but no one was listening.

309
00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:19.618
And I thought, "You know what people listen to,

310
00:13:19.618 --> 00:13:21.023
"that's the voice of business.

311
00:13:21.023 --> 00:13:22.091
"And I'm a businessperson.

312
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:23.391
"I may be a small businessperson,

313
00:13:23.391 --> 00:13:24.529
"but I'm a businessperson,

314
00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:26.131
"and there's power in that."

315
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:27.073
That's when I first started to think,

316
00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:29.895
"Well, I'm gonna use the power of business

317
00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:32.497
"to work for justice."

318
00:13:32.497 --> 00:13:35.140
Even though I had, for so long,

319
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.369
seen business as being the enemy,

320
00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:40.609
that business is unjust and that the interests of business

321
00:13:40.609 --> 00:13:42.675
underlie war and violence,

322
00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:45.006
but the way to counter that

323
00:13:45.006 --> 00:13:48.194
is to use business also.

324
00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.616
Business that's based in community

325
00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:53.243
and is there to serve community

326
00:13:53.243 --> 00:13:56.166
as opposed to the corporate interests

327
00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:59.630
in a corporatism situation.

328
00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:04.096
I formed a business group called BETHRIC,

329
00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:07.561
Businesses for Ethical Trade and Human Rights in Chiapas.

330
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:09.704
And I called up everybody I know,

331
00:14:09.704 --> 00:14:11.596
I belong to a social venture network,

332
00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:13.837
which is a membership organization

333
00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:16.654
of progressive business owners and investors.

334
00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:18.608
From that, I knew a lot of different progressive people,

335
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.617
and they would know somebody else and so on.

336
00:14:20.617 --> 00:14:23.550
I tried to round up businesses that sourced

337
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.654
from Mexico, like coffee and textiles,

338
00:14:26.654 --> 00:14:29.197
and got a group of about 15 businesses,

339
00:14:29.197 --> 00:14:30.902
American businesses, that included

340
00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:33.434
Ben &amp; Jerry's and the Frontier Cooperative

341
00:14:33.434 --> 00:14:35.617
and a lot of different progressive coffee companies,

342
00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:39.739
Thanksgiving Coffee Company, here in Sonoma.

343
00:14:40.789 --> 00:14:42.734
That gave me an impressive letterhead,

344
00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:45.033
you know, for my stationery

345
00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:46.844
and for our press releases and so on.

346
00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:50.640
I took just a small group down to Chiapas

347
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.241
to investigate how the violence

348
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.412
was affecting the indigenous businesses,

349
00:14:55.412 --> 00:14:58.152
and of course, therefore, the indigenous people,

350
00:14:58.152 --> 00:15:00.021
but put it in the context of business.

351
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:03.353
We went down there, we hired a guide, a translator,

352
00:15:03.353 --> 00:15:05.972
someone that was knowledgeable,

353
00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:07.463
actually an American who had been

354
00:15:07.463 --> 00:15:11.066
working down there for a while, Monica Ferrell.

355
00:15:11.066 --> 00:15:14.464
We went around and saw

356
00:15:14.464 --> 00:15:18.271
what was happening, how the paramilitaries

357
00:15:18.271 --> 00:15:21.609
were forcing people off their land,

358
00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:26.318
destroying the farm crops, destroying the coffee harvest,

359
00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:29.023
and basically attacking the self-reliance

360
00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:31.658
of the indigenous people

361
00:15:32.778 --> 00:15:36.895
and trying to keep the indigenous coffee-growers

362
00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:39.217
in a position where they had to sell

363
00:15:39.217 --> 00:15:42.241
the coffee to the Coyotes at a very low price

364
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:44.405
because there was no one else to sell it to and they--

365
00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:45.836
<v Blonde Woman>Explain Coyotes.</v>

366
00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:48.669
<v ->The Coyotes are kind of the free agents</v>

367
00:15:48.669 --> 00:15:52.515
that go around and buy coffee from the peasant farmers,

368
00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:55.008
and then they sell that coffee to the large corporations,

369
00:15:55.008 --> 00:15:57.407
like the big coffee companies and so on.

370
00:15:57.407 --> 00:15:59.253
This is a way of getting cheap coffee

371
00:15:59.253 --> 00:16:01.733
funneled into the corporate system

372
00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:05.661
for export to big American and foreign coffee companies.

373
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:10.754
With that experience, well,

374
00:16:10.754 --> 00:16:13.691
first of all, our little delegation went to Mexico City

375
00:16:13.691 --> 00:16:16.336
on our way home to have a press conference.

376
00:16:16.336 --> 00:16:18.056
Some friends of mine from Global Exchange

377
00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:19.531
helped arrange the press conference,

378
00:16:19.531 --> 00:16:22.131
and I had no idea how successful it was gonna be,

379
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:24.233
when we walked into the press room,

380
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.797
the whole room was full.

381
00:16:25.797 --> 00:16:27.844
I mean there must have been 50 press people there

382
00:16:27.844 --> 00:16:32.186
with instantaneous translation set up,

383
00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:35.838
so that they could translate from our English report

384
00:16:35.838 --> 00:16:39.772
into Spanish for the Spanish press that was awaiting our--

385
00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:41.282
But when they saw our letterhead with

386
00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:43.157
Ben &amp; Jerry's and all these American firms on it,

387
00:16:43.157 --> 00:16:45.096
they all showed up.

388
00:16:45.096 --> 00:16:47.453
We had an amazing press conference,

389
00:16:47.453 --> 00:16:50.030
and the next day, the English-speaking newspaper

390
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.922
had as their headline,

391
00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:54.570
"U.S. firms call for peace in Chiapas."

392
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.269
That the voice of business was heard.

393
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:57.403
<v Blonde Woman>Good job.</v>

394
00:16:57.403 --> 00:16:58.974
<v ->That was really what empowered me</v>

395
00:16:58.974 --> 00:17:00.160
even more than lying down in front of

396
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.605
that bulldozer years before,

397
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:05.067
to realize that it worked, that our voice got through.

398
00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:07.317
Friends of mine later said that

399
00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:10.255
that is the kind of thing that really saved lives

400
00:17:10.255 --> 00:17:11.625
because once the Mexican government,

401
00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:15.225
the paramilitaries and so on knew that we were watching

402
00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:19.926
that they didn't dare continue to have massacres and so on.

403
00:17:19.926 --> 00:17:21.702
There hasn't been a massacre since then.

404
00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:24.600
It sort of went underground, the whole violence.

405
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.497
Somebody might disappear here and there,

406
00:17:26.497 --> 00:17:29.539
but there wasn't any very blatant violence

407
00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:30.947
as there had been in the past.

408
00:17:30.947 --> 00:17:34.408
I'm not saying that we stopped that single-handedly,

409
00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:37.793
but I feel like we've contributed to that situation.

410
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.817
I guess I had a turning point

411
00:17:40.817 --> 00:17:43.313
when a Mexican reporter said to me,

412
00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:47.388
"Is your business group a business group?

413
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:48.955
"Are you businesses, or are you

414
00:17:48.955 --> 00:17:50.790
a human rights organization?"

415
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.743
So I proudly said, "We're both."

416
00:17:53.743 --> 00:17:57.396
And he looked very puzzled, but in making that statement,

417
00:17:57.396 --> 00:18:01.165
it became clear to me what I wanted to do next,

418
00:18:01.165 --> 00:18:05.140
and that was to help the Zapatistas start a business

419
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.838
and to really work on creating a just global economy,

420
00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:13.523
where people got fairly treated,

421
00:18:13.523 --> 00:18:18.039
got a fair wage for their labor and so on.

422
00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:21.368
That began kind of a new chapter for me.

423
00:18:22.298 --> 00:18:23.626
When I got home,

424
00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:28.175
I went back to Frontier Coffee.

425
00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:31.601
I never had met the owner of the company,

426
00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:34.840
the CEO, before, but I knew his name.

427
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.965
I called him up, and I said,

428
00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:40.309
"Will you go back to Chiapas with me

429
00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:43.549
"and help the Zapatistas start a coffee cooperative?"

430
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:45.622
And he did! And I couldn't believe it.

431
00:18:45.622 --> 00:18:47.484
He went with me.

432
00:18:47.484 --> 00:18:50.154
I took some investor friends from home,

433
00:18:50.154 --> 00:18:52.174
two older gentleman that were

434
00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:53.846
interested in progressive causes.

435
00:18:53.846 --> 00:18:55.947
And we went back to Chiapas, we ended up

436
00:18:55.947 --> 00:18:57.782
going back several different times,

437
00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:01.161
and our translator-guide, Monica Ferrell,

438
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:04.028
was able to reach the Zapatista leadership

439
00:19:04.028 --> 00:19:06.760
to let them know what we had in mind.

440
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.936
They told us about two coffee cooperatives

441
00:19:10.936 --> 00:19:13.838
that they felt were ready to begin moving towards

442
00:19:13.838 --> 00:19:17.223
having enough strength to do exporting.

443
00:19:17.577 --> 00:19:19.887
Our little delegation went and met with them.

444
00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:22.314
We chose one because the quality of the coffee was better,

445
00:19:22.314 --> 00:19:23.521
it was a little higher in the mountains

446
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:26.551
where the coffee is better, and the cloud reserves,

447
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:27.782
and started working with them.

448
00:19:27.782 --> 00:19:29.616
The cooperative was called Moot Veets,

449
00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:31.857
which means "mountain of the birds"

450
00:19:31.857 --> 00:19:34.702
in a little town, very remote.

451
00:19:36.122 --> 00:19:39.871
We started putting together a business plan, basically.

452
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:44.471
Rick, his company from Frontier,

453
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:48.208
and Equal Exchange was part of our delegation,

454
00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:49.950
they sent technical people to help

455
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.654
with organic certification.

456
00:19:53.654 --> 00:19:54.617
We raised the money for

457
00:19:54.617 --> 00:19:58.501
their organic certification labeling.

458
00:19:59.749 --> 00:20:03.592
We raised money, and I put in $20,000

459
00:20:03.592 --> 00:20:06.715
from the White Dog Cafe for the pre-financing

460
00:20:06.715 --> 00:20:08.329
of the harvest, and that's the main

461
00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:11.266
obstacle for these cooperations.

462
00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:14.308
The peasants, when they finish picking their coffee,

463
00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:15.512
they have to find a buyer right away

464
00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:17.450
'cause they need the money.

465
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.660
There was never this up-front money

466
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.713
for the cooperative to buy the coffee from the peasants,

467
00:20:22.713 --> 00:20:26.208
so the peasant members of these cooperatives

468
00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:27.648
would sell the coffee to the Coyotes

469
00:20:27.648 --> 00:20:28.983
just 'cause they needed the cash.

470
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.924
<v Blonde Woman>You took the panic and the fear</v>

471
00:20:32.924 --> 00:20:34.376
out of that by pre-financing?

472
00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:35.188
<v ->Right.</v>

473
00:20:35.188 --> 00:20:36.512
<v Blonde Woman>So they could hold out for,</v>

474
00:20:36.512 --> 00:20:40.366
or a proper amount of money could be negotiated

475
00:20:40.366 --> 00:20:41.632
for the crop then, right?

476
00:20:41.632 --> 00:20:44.191
<v ->Right, exactly. Exactly.</v>

477
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:46.403
My friend, Hal Taussig, put in $20,000,

478
00:20:46.403 --> 00:20:49.271
and I put in $20,000, and $40,000 is what was needed

479
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:52.641
to buy enough coffee to fill a container.

480
00:20:52.641 --> 00:20:53.814
With the exports, you have to fill

481
00:20:53.814 --> 00:20:56.218
a whole container to make it work.

482
00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.052
Or maybe in the beginning it was a

483
00:20:58.052 --> 00:20:59.712
half a container that we were trying to get together,

484
00:20:59.712 --> 00:21:01.686
I can't remember now, it's been a while.

485
00:21:01.686 --> 00:21:04.751
But anyway, we got enough money to make it feasible,

486
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:08.117
economically feasible to ship out of the country.

487
00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:11.995
It was with great anticipation

488
00:21:11.995 --> 00:21:14.189
that the first shipment made it

489
00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:15.629
because they were afraid that the Coyotes,

490
00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:17.928
the paramilitaries, would attack their truck

491
00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:21.202
getting to the port to ship it to the States.

492
00:21:21.202 --> 00:21:24.494
But we got word that it had made it

493
00:21:24.494 --> 00:21:29.306
into the States, and then it went to fair-trade importers,

494
00:21:29.306 --> 00:21:33.787
one in Texas called the Human Bean Company.

495
00:21:33.787 --> 00:21:35.215
<v Blonde Woman>Oh, yes, I've heard of the Human Bean,</v>

496
00:21:35.215 --> 00:21:36.922
I've seen that.
<v ->You've heard of Cari Apple?</v>

497
00:21:36.922 --> 00:21:40.792
And the other two cooperative coffees

498
00:21:40.792 --> 00:21:44.647
near Atlanta, outside of Atlanta, Bill Harris.

499
00:21:45.957 --> 00:21:49.752
Hal's $20,000 went to Bill Harris,

500
00:21:49.752 --> 00:21:54.272
to send his pre-financing to the Zapatista cooperative,

501
00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.234
and then mine went to Cari Apple.

502
00:21:56.234 --> 00:21:59.723
I'd never met Cari Apple, so I loaned her $20,000.

503
00:21:59.723 --> 00:22:02.202
Then they sent that money down,

504
00:22:02.202 --> 00:22:04.768
and then it was returned with the coffee.

505
00:22:04.768 --> 00:22:08.878
Once the two importers, Bill and Cari, sold their coffee

506
00:22:08.878 --> 00:22:10.956
then they returned the money to Hal and me.

507
00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:13.185
And then we repeated that process the second year,

508
00:22:13.185 --> 00:22:15.618
until, by the third year the cooperative

509
00:22:15.618 --> 00:22:18.421
had gotten so strong that they could pre-finance

510
00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:19.629
their own harvest and didn't need

511
00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:21.463
that pre-financing from the States.

512
00:22:21.463 --> 00:22:23.247
<v Blonde Woman>What a success story.</v>

513
00:22:23.247 --> 00:22:26.046
<v ->And they ended up eventually shipping 15 containers</v>

514
00:22:26.046 --> 00:22:28.045
to Europe and the United States.

515
00:22:28.045 --> 00:22:31.280
Of course, we use that coffee at the White Dog Cafe,

516
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.390
progressive coffee shops all over

517
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.043
Europe and the United States was using this coffee.

518
00:22:36.043 --> 00:22:37.448
<v Blonde Woman>What was happening on the other side</v>

519
00:22:37.448 --> 00:22:40.535
of it as they became more sustainable,

520
00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:44.483
to the communities of the cooperative?

521
00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:47.538
I mean, what did you see

522
00:22:47.538 --> 00:22:50.462
by way of changes in their,

523
00:22:51.252 --> 00:22:54.328
whether you want to call it their communities,

524
00:22:54.328 --> 00:22:58.120
their levels of security, what did you see?

525
00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:01.805
<v ->My exposure wasn't that great</v>

526
00:23:01.805 --> 00:23:04.011
because I only would be there during the time

527
00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:05.868
that we were kind of arranging the business deal.

528
00:23:05.868 --> 00:23:07.505
But what I did see was

529
00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:13.932
their organization becoming more professional.

530
00:23:16.215 --> 00:23:20.150
I'll tell you the first time that the Zapatista leaders

531
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.098
entered the room with their ski masks and bandannas

532
00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:28.428
because they wanted to come to the final business deal

533
00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:31.191
when we were making the final arrangements

534
00:23:31.191 --> 00:23:33.339
that the cooperative needed to get the permission

535
00:23:33.339 --> 00:23:37.101
from the leadership of the Zapatistas.

536
00:23:37.101 --> 00:23:39.376
We were all sitting there around a table

537
00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:43.494
and in walk five men, and women,

538
00:23:43.494 --> 00:23:45.785
women leaders, with the bandannas on and so on,

539
00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:48.208
and I kind of gasped, "My god!

540
00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:51.662
"This is real, these are really the Zapatistas!"

541
00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:57.320
But anyway, they developed their business

542
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.824
is what happened.

543
00:23:58.824 --> 00:24:01.354
I'm sure they used those profits then

544
00:24:01.354 --> 00:24:03.293
not only to reinvest in their company,

545
00:24:03.293 --> 00:24:04.826
to grow it larger,

546
00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:07.066
and I know they were trying to raise enough money

547
00:24:07.066 --> 00:24:09.295
to buy a processing plant

548
00:24:09.295 --> 00:24:10.503
because if they process the beans

549
00:24:10.503 --> 00:24:12.302
then they make more money at home.

550
00:24:12.302 --> 00:24:14.740
I don't know if they ever got to that.

551
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.202
I did go back a couple times since then

552
00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:19.280
bringing my employees from the White Dog.

553
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.950
I said, "I want you to know where our coffee comes from

554
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.285
"and to have a direct relationship

555
00:24:23.285 --> 00:24:24.783
"with the growers of our coffee."

556
00:24:24.783 --> 00:24:26.153
So we did that a couple times,

557
00:24:26.153 --> 00:24:28.417
and we also developed relationships

558
00:24:28.417 --> 00:24:31.602
with the women crafts cooperatives,

559
00:24:31.602 --> 00:24:33.793
and we have a store, I have the White Dog Cafe

560
00:24:33.793 --> 00:24:36.091
and the Black Cat, which is our retail store

561
00:24:36.091 --> 00:24:39.431
that features locally made and fair-trade crafts.

562
00:24:40.211 --> 00:24:42.442
I brought down the manager/buyer of the Black Cat,

563
00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:45.836
and he bought crafts from the women's cooperatives,

564
00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:49.208
including bags for the coffee.

565
00:24:49.208 --> 00:24:52.006
We sold bags of the Moot Veets coffee

566
00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:55.536
in our gift shop as well as using it in the White Dog.

567
00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:58.740
The bags were in these little cloth sacks

568
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.946
that the women made that were bordered "Moot Veets"

569
00:25:00.946 --> 00:25:02.780
the name of their cooperative with the hill of birds,

570
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.731
with the mountain with the birds flying,

571
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:07.158
that we sold in our gift shop.

572
00:25:07.158 --> 00:25:09.687
We did develop that business as well.

573
00:25:09.687 --> 00:25:11.089
<v Blonde Woman>The fair-trade label really</v>

574
00:25:11.089 --> 00:25:13.049
does mean something?

575
00:25:14.098 --> 00:25:16.571
<v ->The fair-trade label means that the people</v>

576
00:25:16.571 --> 00:25:20.507
that grew the coffee or made the crafts

577
00:25:21.147 --> 00:25:23.682
made a living wage, whatever that may be

578
00:25:23.682 --> 00:25:24.877
<v Blonde Woman>I ask only for one reason</v>

579
00:25:24.877 --> 00:25:26.114
because now you look at

580
00:25:26.114 --> 00:25:27.844
the word "organically grown"

581
00:25:27.844 --> 00:25:29.481
and it has some different implications,

582
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:31.652
as you get corporate interests who come in and influence

583
00:25:31.652 --> 00:25:34.323
legislation that lowers standards and so forth.

584
00:25:34.323 --> 00:25:36.087
Has that happened with fair-trade,

585
00:25:36.087 --> 00:25:38.436
or is fair-trade still fair-trade?

586
00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:40.639
<v ->I'm certainly no expert in it,</v>

587
00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:43.172
but I think, for me, I always look for both

588
00:25:43.172 --> 00:25:45.837
the organic label and the fair-trade label.

589
00:25:45.837 --> 00:25:49.245
Because you're right, a lot of organic is not fair-trade.

590
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.552
So I think it's important to look for both.

591
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:55.608
<v Blonde Woman>Now let's take your journey forward, then.</v>

592
00:25:55.608 --> 00:25:57.272
Okay, you did the coffee thing,

593
00:25:57.272 --> 00:25:59.177
you did a fabulous thing in the world.

594
00:25:59.177 --> 00:26:01.301
The press recognized it, you feel empowered,

595
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:03.286
but then you start stumbling on new information

596
00:26:03.286 --> 00:26:05.725
regarding some of the other offerings of the restaurant

597
00:26:05.725 --> 00:26:08.055
and now you're into the animal issue.

598
00:26:08.055 --> 00:26:10.076
<v ->Right, okay.</v>

599
00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:12.362
So another big turning point for me

600
00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:13.953
in terms of my consciousness,

601
00:26:13.953 --> 00:26:16.960
I guess, and my work,

602
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.328
came about when I found out about

603
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:23.392
the atrocious way that pigs are treated

604
00:26:23.392 --> 00:26:26.002
in the industrial farm system.

605
00:26:26.002 --> 00:26:27.479
White Dog Cafe had been buying

606
00:26:27.479 --> 00:26:28.802
from local farmers for many years

607
00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:30.335
in terms of fruits and vegetables,

608
00:26:30.335 --> 00:26:33.584
and I knew about the importance of buying

609
00:26:33.584 --> 00:26:37.184
uncaged eggs and pastured chicken and whatnot,

610
00:26:37.184 --> 00:26:39.518
but I didn't know about the state

611
00:26:39.518 --> 00:26:42.722
of pigs on industrial farms.

612
00:26:42.722 --> 00:26:45.359
I read John Robbins' book, Diet for a New America,

613
00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:47.426
back in the '90s and learned about

614
00:26:47.426 --> 00:26:50.700
how these pigs, mother pigs, are kept in these cages

615
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.801
where they can't move forward or backward,

616
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:55.123
they stand on cement their entire lives,

617
00:26:55.123 --> 00:26:57.340
there's a drain for the manure that goes

618
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.706
into a lagoon that then goes on

619
00:26:58.706 --> 00:27:01.120
to pollute the water system and the air

620
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.902
in the rural areas.

621
00:27:02.902 --> 00:27:04.713
They never feel a ray of sunshine,

622
00:27:04.713 --> 00:27:06.977
they never have a breath of fresh air.

623
00:27:06.977 --> 00:27:10.680
They're social creatures who love to sleep

624
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.782
in big piles of pigs, yet they are never allowed

625
00:27:12.782 --> 00:27:13.815
to touch another pig.

626
00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:17.067
They're just confined in this metal cage,

627
00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:18.325
and they're artificially inseminated,

628
00:27:18.325 --> 00:27:20.089
their babies are taken are prematurely.

629
00:27:20.089 --> 00:27:22.573
They don't have the opportunity to build nests.

630
00:27:22.573 --> 00:27:24.536
Right before they give birth, they become very anxious

631
00:27:24.536 --> 00:27:26.034
because their instincts call for them

632
00:27:26.034 --> 00:27:27.369
to build their nest for the babies,

633
00:27:27.369 --> 00:27:29.668
but they have to deliver on these cement floors,

634
00:27:29.668 --> 00:27:31.177
and the babies are taken away prematurely.

635
00:27:31.177 --> 00:27:33.174
The process is repeated over and over again

636
00:27:33.174 --> 00:27:35.723
as though the pigs are just a piece of machinery.

637
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:38.883
I guess my connection to animals

638
00:27:38.883 --> 00:27:41.330
comes from my love of my dogs.

639
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.262
And we see on the faces of our dogs

640
00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:47.001
all the emotions of love, of fear,

641
00:27:47.001 --> 00:27:49.661
of humor, of guilt,

642
00:27:49.661 --> 00:27:51.305
you know, if they take a little piece of food

643
00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:52.860
off the table or whatever (laughs).

644
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.429
I mean, they have emotions, and I looked into this,

645
00:27:54.429 --> 00:27:56.448
and all mammals, whether we're dogs or pigs

646
00:27:56.448 --> 00:27:59.375
or human beings, have the same part of our brain

647
00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:01.198
that contains the emotions,

648
00:28:01.198 --> 00:28:05.365
and all mammals are capable of these emotions,

649
00:28:05.365 --> 00:28:08.976
the elephants, the cats, the dogs, and the pigs.

650
00:28:08.976 --> 00:28:11.682
I was just outraged at the thought

651
00:28:11.682 --> 00:28:13.911
of my dog being treated like this,

652
00:28:13.911 --> 00:28:16.314
much less like a human being or whatever.

653
00:28:16.314 --> 00:28:18.044
But any mammal, how could we do this?

654
00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:20.784
And I thought that this is a breach of our trust

655
00:28:20.784 --> 00:28:23.419
as the stewards of farm animals.

656
00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:24.963
It's a violation of nature,

657
00:28:24.963 --> 00:28:27.367
to treat these mothers this way,

658
00:28:27.367 --> 00:28:31.430
and the whole concept of birth and creation and so on.

659
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.810
And it's really destroying our own humanity

660
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.474
to institutionalize this type of cruelty and brutality

661
00:28:40.474 --> 00:28:42.274
and base our food system on it.

662
00:28:42.274 --> 00:28:44.282
When I found out about this, I was so appalled,

663
00:28:44.282 --> 00:28:46.337
and I thought, "Oh my gosh, the pork we're serving

664
00:28:46.337 --> 00:28:48.636
"at the White Dog must come from this system?"

665
00:28:48.636 --> 00:28:49.774
Because unless you know otherwise,

666
00:28:49.774 --> 00:28:52.456
that's where it comes from in this country.

667
00:28:52.456 --> 00:28:54.058
Finally, I just went into the kitchen and said,

668
00:28:54.058 --> 00:28:55.451
"Take the all the pork off the menu.

669
00:28:55.451 --> 00:28:57.286
"The bacon, the ham, the porkchops."

670
00:28:57.286 --> 00:28:59.491
That we can't be a part of this evil system.

671
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:02.458
That we have to find an alternative.

672
00:29:02.765 --> 00:29:05.262
I later thought about this that this is

673
00:29:05.262 --> 00:29:08.312
the Ghandian, Martin Luther King, concept

674
00:29:10.192 --> 00:29:13.416
of non-cooperation with an evil system,

675
00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:14.639
that the first step in social change

676
00:29:14.639 --> 00:29:16.972
is not to cooperate with an evil system.

677
00:29:16.972 --> 00:29:18.714
Whether it's a segregated bus,

678
00:29:18.714 --> 00:29:19.817
and you have a bus boycott,

679
00:29:19.817 --> 00:29:23.718
or assault march, or whatever,

680
00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:26.748
that you stop cooperating as the first step,

681
00:29:26.748 --> 00:29:29.081
and then after you stop cooperating with the evil system,

682
00:29:29.081 --> 00:29:30.149
you're in a position where

683
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:31.926
you have to build an alternative system.

684
00:29:31.926 --> 00:29:33.389
And so that's what I did.

685
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:36.720
I thought, "Okay, where can I get the pastured pork?"

686
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.799
I asked the farmer who was bringing in

687
00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.738
the free-range eggs and chicken

688
00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:42.874
if he knew a place to get pigs that were raised

689
00:29:42.874 --> 00:29:44.336
traditionally on the pasture, and he did,

690
00:29:44.336 --> 00:29:46.044
and we started ordering two pigs a week.

691
00:29:46.044 --> 00:29:47.344
And we had to order the whole pig

692
00:29:47.344 --> 00:29:49.445
and learn how to cook all the different parts of the pig

693
00:29:49.445 --> 00:29:51.849
and made pork sandwiches for the bar,

694
00:29:51.849 --> 00:29:53.648
and sausages, and so on.

695
00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:58.139
Then I found out about the plight of the cow,

696
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.551
how cows are herbivores, they're supposed

697
00:29:59.551 --> 00:30:02.910
to eat grass and clover, but have been taken off the fields

698
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.106
and fed grain because of the

699
00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:07.995
U.S. Brondell subsidies to the grain farmers.

700
00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:09.973
It makes the cow sick,

701
00:30:09.973 --> 00:30:12.293
it produces a strain of E. coli

702
00:30:12.293 --> 00:30:16.399
that's only found in grain-fed cows that is deadly.

703
00:30:16.737 --> 00:30:19.206
It produces all this methane gas.

704
00:30:19.206 --> 00:30:21.148
<v Blonde Woman>It creates an anemia of sorts, too.</v>

705
00:30:21.148 --> 00:30:22.297
If you look at the difference

706
00:30:22.297 --> 00:30:25.176
between grass-fed beef and commercial beef,

707
00:30:25.176 --> 00:30:27.847
it's a completely different color, even.

708
00:30:27.847 --> 00:30:31.049
<v ->There's a lot of fat in the grain-fed,</v>

709
00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:34.362
and the advertising programs us,

710
00:30:34.362 --> 00:30:36.103
so we're programmed to look for that

711
00:30:36.103 --> 00:30:38.423
fatty marbling, that that's supposed to be a good thing.

712
00:30:38.423 --> 00:30:39.526
<v Blonde Woman>But there is still</v>

713
00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:41.744
this kind of anemic quality to it.

714
00:30:41.744 --> 00:30:44.609
<v ->It doesn't have the rich red color of the meat,</v>

715
00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:47.173
of the grass-fed, but the grass-fed

716
00:30:47.173 --> 00:30:48.416
doesn't have the fat, and so a lot of Americans

717
00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:49.599
are used to having all this fat,

718
00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:52.397
so they think it's juicier and better for you,

719
00:30:52.397 --> 00:30:54.371
and they're trained to think that this is the best steak.

720
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:56.040
Where actually, it's not,

721
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.131
that the grass-fed is healthier for you,

722
00:30:58.131 --> 00:31:00.513
it has vitamins and minerals that are lacking

723
00:31:00.513 --> 00:31:03.341
in the grain-fed,

724
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:05.941
and it has the fat that's bad for you.

725
00:31:05.941 --> 00:31:09.541
So it's not as healthy for the human beings,

726
00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:12.085
for the milk either is missing

727
00:31:12.085 --> 00:31:14.985
important Omega-3--

728
00:31:14.985 --> 00:31:18.358
I'm not a nutritionist, but I do know that's not as healthy.

729
00:31:20.298 --> 00:31:22.074
I found a source for grass-fed beef

730
00:31:22.074 --> 00:31:23.862
and switched our menu to all grass-fed beef,

731
00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:26.472
grass-fed hamburgers, steaks,

732
00:31:26.472 --> 00:31:29.805
and grass-fed dairy.

733
00:31:29.805 --> 00:31:31.374
Finally, I looked at my menu and thought,

734
00:31:31.374 --> 00:31:33.800
"I've done it; we have a cruelty-free menu.

735
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.414
"All of our meat and poultry come from

736
00:31:35.414 --> 00:31:37.179
small farms where the animals are treated

737
00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:39.721
with respect and compassion.

738
00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:42.392
This is all about us, this is our market niche,

739
00:31:42.392 --> 00:31:44.052
the White Dog is the only restaurant

740
00:31:44.052 --> 00:31:46.457
in town that does this."

741
00:31:46.457 --> 00:31:48.081
<v Blonde Woman>You were top White Dog!</v>

742
00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:49.852
<v ->Yeah, we're the top dog!</v>

743
00:31:50.991 --> 00:31:52.001
And then I thought to myself,

744
00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:53.940
"Well, Judy, if you really do care about the pigs

745
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.169
"and the cows, and you really do care about

746
00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:57.864
"the environment that's being polluted

747
00:31:57.864 --> 00:31:59.373
"by the concentration of manure.

748
00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:01.579
"And if you care about the family farms

749
00:32:01.579 --> 00:32:03.982
"that are being driven off their farms.

750
00:32:03.982 --> 00:32:07.581
"If you care about the local economy,

751
00:32:07.581 --> 00:32:09.811
"if you care about the workers that are

752
00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:10.983
"in these slaughterhouses,

753
00:32:10.983 --> 00:32:13.178
"horrible slaughterhouses and factory farms.

754
00:32:13.178 --> 00:32:14.989
"And you care about the consumers, ultimately,

755
00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:17.485
"that eat this meat that, unbeknownst to them

756
00:32:17.485 --> 00:32:19.985
"is full of hormones and antibiotics,

757
00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:23.392
"then rather than keeping this as your market niche,

758
00:32:23.392 --> 00:32:26.506
"you'll share this information with your competitors,

759
00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:28.950
"and get everyone to do this."

760
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.370
That was a real threshold that I stepped over

761
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.018
because I realized that it wasn't enough anymore

762
00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:35.770
just to have good practices within my own company,

763
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.674
that I had to work cooperatively with others

764
00:32:37.674 --> 00:32:41.018
to build a whole local system based on these values,

765
00:32:41.018 --> 00:32:43.479
that there was no such thing as one sustainable business,

766
00:32:43.479 --> 00:32:46.649
that we can only be part of a sustainable system,

767
00:32:46.649 --> 00:32:48.843
and that we have to work cooperatively

768
00:32:48.843 --> 00:32:50.921
to create that system.

769
00:32:50.921 --> 00:32:53.023
The farmers needed more than me buying from them

770
00:32:53.023 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Blonde Woman>I'd hope!</v>

771
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.367
<v ->Of course, so first of all,</v>

772
00:32:56.367 --> 00:32:58.932
I asked the farmer who was bringing in my two pigs a week,

773
00:32:58.932 --> 00:33:00.290
"Would you like to expand your business?"

774
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.173
And he said, "Yes."

775
00:33:01.173 --> 00:33:02.508
I said, "Well, what's holding you back?"

776
00:33:02.508 --> 00:33:04.076
And he said he needed $30,000

777
00:33:04.076 --> 00:33:05.919
to buy a refrigerated truck, so he could

778
00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:08.290
fill it with meat to bring it into all the farmers.

779
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.942
So, I loaned him the $30,000,

780
00:33:09.942 --> 00:33:11.128
and he bought the truck.

781
00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:13.200
That was almost ten years ago now,

782
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.353
and he's paid it back.

783
00:33:15.353 --> 00:33:17.884
Then I formed a non-profit, the White Dog Cafe Foundation,

784
00:33:17.884 --> 00:33:19.857
and started putting 20% of my profits

785
00:33:19.857 --> 00:33:21.534
into the non-profit,

786
00:33:21.534 --> 00:33:24.977
hired our first staff person, Ann Karlen,

787
00:33:24.977 --> 00:33:28.228
and started a project called Fair Food Project.

788
00:33:28.228 --> 00:33:30.097
And it was Ann's role to go around

789
00:33:30.097 --> 00:33:32.535
to the other restaurants and chefs and owners

790
00:33:32.535 --> 00:33:34.230
and tell them about the benefits

791
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.426
of buying from local farmers.

792
00:33:35.426 --> 00:33:37.574
And so, that's how we began.

793
00:33:37.574 --> 00:33:39.332
Fair Food was started eight years ago,

794
00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:42.318
and now it's its own independent non-profit

795
00:33:42.318 --> 00:33:44.784
spun off from White Dog, and has twelve employees,

796
00:33:44.784 --> 00:33:47.135
has many different programs that we've connected

797
00:33:47.135 --> 00:33:50.717
hundreds of farmers with businesses

798
00:33:50.717 --> 00:33:53.921
in the urban marketplace, restaurants and stores.

799
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:58.666
That's when I moved, really, from being

800
00:33:58.666 --> 00:34:02.342
a competitive businessperson to being a cooperative one,

801
00:34:02.342 --> 00:34:05.329
in order to build our local living economy.

802
00:34:05.329 --> 00:34:07.233
<v Blonde Woman>And local living economies</v>

803
00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.767
are the key words here.

804
00:34:08.767 --> 00:34:12.239
You also made a choice along the way,

805
00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.146
even though you had this

806
00:34:14.146 --> 00:34:16.941
stunningly successful business,

807
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:21.186
and others encouraged you to replicate, open other ones,

808
00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:24.718
you decided not to, and you decided not to as,

809
00:34:24.718 --> 00:34:29.050
I heard you say, "Because of the quality of relationships."

810
00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:30.959
Can you expand on that?

811
00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:35.114
<v ->Success in the business world is measured by growth,</v>

812
00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:36.802
and so of course, people would always come up to me

813
00:34:36.802 --> 00:34:38.597
and they'd hear I'm a well-known restaurateur.

814
00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:39.793
"Well, how many White Dogs are there?

815
00:34:39.793 --> 00:34:41.673
"How many units do you have?"

816
00:34:41.673 --> 00:34:43.102
And I said, "I just have one, you know."

817
00:34:43.102 --> 00:34:45.151
And at first I thought, "Am I big sissy,

818
00:34:45.151 --> 00:34:47.804
"because I'm not doing a chain of White Dogs, or whatever?"

819
00:34:47.804 --> 00:34:49.208
But then I realized that what was

820
00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:51.310
the most important thing to me, in my business

821
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.129
were the relationships I had with my employees,

822
00:34:54.129 --> 00:34:57.010
with my customers, with the farmers,

823
00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.185
and that if I grew bigger and bigger

824
00:34:59.185 --> 00:35:01.757
that I wouldn't have these authentic relationships.

825
00:35:01.757 --> 00:35:04.520
And that business is really about relationships.

826
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.221
Money is simply a tool,

827
00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:07.813
that it's about our relationships with everyone

828
00:35:07.813 --> 00:35:10.276
that we buy from and sell to and work with,

829
00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:13.141
and also about our relationship with nature,

830
00:35:13.141 --> 00:35:15.956
which is the underpinning, the foundation

831
00:35:15.956 --> 00:35:19.207
for any economy or any business.

832
00:35:21.157 --> 00:35:23.358
I decided to stay small and realized that

833
00:35:23.358 --> 00:35:26.149
I could grow in other ways beside material ways.

834
00:35:26.149 --> 00:35:29.812
That I could grow by raising my consciousness,

835
00:35:29.812 --> 00:35:33.719
by increasing education, knowledge for myself,

836
00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:35.890
and for my customers, and for my staff.

837
00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.526
I could grow by deepening the relationships

838
00:35:38.526 --> 00:35:42.682
that I had by increasing my well-being and happiness

839
00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:45.971
and that of my community, and by having more fun.

840
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.938
Rather than growing wide, I grew deep

841
00:35:49.938 --> 00:35:51.842
in my own community and started putting on

842
00:35:51.842 --> 00:35:53.537
educational programs; we became really

843
00:35:53.537 --> 00:35:56.191
a hub for social activism.

844
00:35:56.614 --> 00:35:57.914
We did programs taking our customers

845
00:35:57.914 --> 00:35:59.772
on solar house tours, or teaching them

846
00:35:59.772 --> 00:36:02.152
how to do energy audits of their house,

847
00:36:02.152 --> 00:36:04.683
how bio-diesel fuel was made,

848
00:36:04.683 --> 00:36:07.783
and how our farmer came and picked up our waste fry-oil

849
00:36:07.783 --> 00:36:09.246
and took it out to his farm and

850
00:36:09.246 --> 00:36:10.952
used it to heat his greenhouses

851
00:36:10.952 --> 00:36:13.367
to extend the growing season, and all these things,

852
00:36:13.367 --> 00:36:15.100
to educate.

853
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.635
And I really feel that in this day and age

854
00:36:17.635 --> 00:36:20.693
that every business should become an educator,

855
00:36:20.693 --> 00:36:23.143
and that became a product of the White Dog,

856
00:36:23.143 --> 00:36:26.086
beside food and service, was education.

857
00:36:26.742 --> 00:36:30.411
Sometimes people accused me of using good food

858
00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:33.547
to lure innocent customers into social activism.

859
00:36:33.547 --> 00:36:35.484
<v Blonde Woman>That's a good way to do it.</v>

860
00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:37.388
<v ->That's a good way to do it.</v>

861
00:36:37.388 --> 00:36:40.549
So we really grew a lot of programs.

862
00:36:46.006 --> 00:36:48.724
There were two occasions,

863
00:36:48.724 --> 00:36:52.167
two events that happened in the late fall,

864
00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:54.918
early winter in 1999.

865
00:36:54.918 --> 00:36:57.902
The first was the protests in Seattle

866
00:36:57.902 --> 00:37:00.503
against the WTO, World Trade Organization,

867
00:37:00.503 --> 00:37:04.915
where you saw so many people come out to protest

868
00:37:04.915 --> 00:37:07.179
the role of corporations in our life

869
00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:08.843
and the control that the corporations had

870
00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:10.085
over the global economy.

871
00:37:10.085 --> 00:37:11.711
It was really mischaracterized by the press

872
00:37:11.711 --> 00:37:14.555
as being anti-global, but it was really

873
00:37:14.555 --> 00:37:18.276
anti-corporate control of globalization.

874
00:37:19.129 --> 00:37:20.499
I didn't know anything about the WTO,

875
00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:22.461
I didn't know that Seattle protests were happening,

876
00:37:22.461 --> 00:37:23.866
but my daughter was in college at the time,

877
00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:25.468
and she went and she reported back to me,

878
00:37:25.468 --> 00:37:27.545
and that's how I learned about it.

879
00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.536
When I looked at the news, there was the farmers

880
00:37:29.536 --> 00:37:32.144
and the environmentalists and the union leaders

881
00:37:32.144 --> 00:37:36.138
and the professors and the students, all there

882
00:37:36.138 --> 00:37:40.465
protesting against corporate control of our global economy.

883
00:37:40.465 --> 00:37:42.012
But there was no voice of progressive business,

884
00:37:42.012 --> 00:37:44.594
there was no alternative

885
00:37:44.594 --> 00:37:47.192
vision being voiced.

886
00:37:47.192 --> 00:37:48.491
So I saw the need for that,

887
00:37:48.491 --> 00:37:50.558
especially to get young people working

888
00:37:50.558 --> 00:37:51.951
on something positive rather than just

889
00:37:51.951 --> 00:37:54.328
protesting what they didn't want.

890
00:37:54.328 --> 00:37:57.930
Literally days after Seattle, Ben &amp; Jerry's announced

891
00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.393
that they were being sold to

892
00:37:59.393 --> 00:38:01.332
the Dutch conglomerate Unilever,

893
00:38:01.332 --> 00:38:04.030
and this was a real wake-up call to me.

894
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.313
It was a forced buy-out: Jerry and Ben did not want it.

895
00:38:07.313 --> 00:38:09.973
But nevertheless, the sale did happen.

896
00:38:09.973 --> 00:38:12.131
Ben &amp; Jerry's had been the leader

897
00:38:12.131 --> 00:38:14.117
in our industry's responsible business movement.

898
00:38:14.117 --> 00:38:15.676
<v Blonde Woman>Absolutely.</v>

899
00:38:15.676 --> 00:38:17.414
<v ->I had learned from them about the living wage.</v>

900
00:38:17.414 --> 00:38:20.154
I had learned from them about the multiple bottom line,

901
00:38:20.154 --> 00:38:22.360
that we measure our success not just by profit,

902
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.257
but our effect on society and the environment.

903
00:38:25.257 --> 00:38:28.184
So, I literally sat up in bed in the middle of the night

904
00:38:28.184 --> 00:38:30.594
and said, "My god, they've got Ben &amp; Jerry's."

905
00:38:30.594 --> 00:38:31.727
Because I realized--

906
00:38:31.727 --> 00:38:32.772
<v Blonde Woman>That was a big deal.</v>

907
00:38:32.772 --> 00:38:35.025
<v ->It was a big deal to me,</v>

908
00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:38.686
because of my admiration for the company.

909
00:38:38.738 --> 00:38:39.969
<v Blonde Woman>And it was indicative</v>

910
00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:41.873
of a turning point that then would occur

911
00:38:41.873 --> 00:38:45.751
throughout the retail world of what we would

912
00:38:45.751 --> 00:38:48.909
consider to have been consciously produced product.

913
00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:52.675
There was a domino effect that started occurring from that.

914
00:38:52.675 --> 00:38:54.040
<v ->Even before Ben &amp; Jerry's, though,</v>

915
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.242
Odwalla was sold to Coca-Cola,

916
00:38:56.242 --> 00:38:58.046
Cascadian Farms to General Mills,

917
00:38:58.046 --> 00:38:59.757
Rhino Records to Time Warner.

918
00:38:59.757 --> 00:39:01.331
<v Blonde Woman>Seeds of Change to Mars.</v>

919
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:03.372
<v ->Yeah, there you go.</v>

920
00:39:03.372 --> 00:39:04.692
Seeds of Change to Mars.

921
00:39:04.692 --> 00:39:07.093
And then more recently, Stonyfield Yogurt

922
00:39:07.093 --> 00:39:10.280
to group Danone, the makers of Dannon yogurt.

923
00:39:10.703 --> 00:39:12.004
The Body Shop to L'Oreal,

924
00:39:12.004 --> 00:39:13.699
Tom's of Maine to Colgate,

925
00:39:13.699 --> 00:39:15.839
Honest Tea to Coca-Cola.

926
00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:19.908
So I could see that the socially responsible business

927
00:39:19.908 --> 00:39:23.435
community and the models of our movement

928
00:39:23.435 --> 00:39:27.358
were increasing the concentration of wealth and power,

929
00:39:27.358 --> 00:39:28.780
the very thing that we had

930
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.436
organized against in the first place.

931
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:33.157
And of course, these national brands

932
00:39:33.157 --> 00:39:34.689
often wipe out the smaller companies

933
00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:35.932
as they grow bigger and bigger,

934
00:39:35.932 --> 00:39:39.194
and even if they have good values within their company,

935
00:39:39.194 --> 00:39:41.493
they're eliminating the small guys

936
00:39:41.493 --> 00:39:44.762
until it's just this increasing power and control

937
00:39:44.762 --> 00:39:46.172
by the large corporations.

938
00:39:46.172 --> 00:39:47.344
<v Blonde Woman>This begins looking pretty much</v>

939
00:39:47.344 --> 00:39:49.170
like the corporations that purchased them to begin with.

940
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.194
<v ->Exactly, so I realized that</v>

941
00:39:51.194 --> 00:39:53.176
our movement for responsible business

942
00:39:53.176 --> 00:39:56.148
was using the old paradigm to measure success,

943
00:39:56.148 --> 00:39:57.889
which was continual growth.

944
00:39:57.889 --> 00:39:58.946
<v Blonde Woman>Bottom line, yeah.</v>

945
00:39:58.946 --> 00:40:01.922
<v ->We were the same as what we opposed.</v>

946
00:40:02.585 --> 00:40:05.650
We had to look at growth in a new way,

947
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.982
'cause we had been neglecting the issue of scale,

948
00:40:08.982 --> 00:40:11.351
what is the appropriate scale, what is a human scale

949
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:14.300
where relationships flourish and people are happiest

950
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.917
in the workplace, and where you can grow in different ways.

951
00:40:19.767 --> 00:40:22.972
We were neglecting the issue of place, a sense of place,

952
00:40:22.972 --> 00:40:25.178
that national brands aren't rooted in community,

953
00:40:25.178 --> 00:40:28.679
they're not rooted in a particular natural environment

954
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:30.704
and local community.

955
00:40:30.714 --> 00:40:32.249
And the third issue we were neglecting

956
00:40:32.249 --> 00:40:35.186
was ownership, that we need to have many owners,

957
00:40:35.186 --> 00:40:38.050
and the more owners we have, the more freedom we have.

958
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.852
That's what led me to start

959
00:40:41.852 --> 00:40:43.862
a new national organization

960
00:40:43.862 --> 00:40:47.209
BALLE, the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies,

961
00:40:47.209 --> 00:40:50.038
which at the time I was the chair of the board

962
00:40:50.038 --> 00:40:53.884
of Social Venture Network and along with colleagues there,

963
00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:57.108
we started BALLE as a project of Social Venture Network,

964
00:40:57.108 --> 00:40:58.676
and then eventually spun it off.

965
00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:01.520
Laury Hammel was the co-founder with me.

966
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.508
He had a lot of experience in organizations,

967
00:41:05.508 --> 00:41:08.660
so between the two of us, we launched BALLE

968
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.362
with the help of others, like David Korten

969
00:41:11.362 --> 00:41:13.603
whose still on our board, Michael Shuman,

970
00:41:13.603 --> 00:41:16.799
author of Going Local and The Small Mart Revolution,

971
00:41:16.799 --> 00:41:19.731
who now works for BALLE

972
00:41:19.731 --> 00:41:23.098
on projects he's an expert in,

973
00:41:23.098 --> 00:41:25.304
and others on our board.

974
00:41:25.304 --> 00:41:28.578
And so we started off in the fall of '01,

975
00:41:28.578 --> 00:41:31.144
and we now have 75 networks.

976
00:41:31.144 --> 00:41:32.781
We're an alliance of local networks,

977
00:41:32.781 --> 00:41:35.254
so we're very decentralized, and what we do

978
00:41:35.254 --> 00:41:37.715
is to help these local networks, there's 75 now

979
00:41:37.715 --> 00:41:39.689
in the United States and Canada,

980
00:41:39.689 --> 00:41:41.952
we help them get started,

981
00:41:41.952 --> 00:41:44.922
we help them strengthen themselves

982
00:41:44.922 --> 00:41:48.913
and connect to the other networks throughout the country.

983
00:41:51.095 --> 00:41:53.905
That's where I've been really putting my efforts

984
00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:58.071
for the last eight years in this movement.

985
00:41:59.071 --> 00:42:02.311
In local living economies, we call them local

986
00:42:02.311 --> 00:42:05.074
because basic needs are made locally

987
00:42:05.074 --> 00:42:07.616
by locally owned farms and businesses,

988
00:42:07.616 --> 00:42:09.753
and we say living because it's an economy

989
00:42:09.753 --> 00:42:13.050
that supports both healthy, natural life

990
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.887
and vibrant community life.

991
00:42:15.887 --> 00:42:17.930
Local living economies.

992
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:20.759
Do you want me to go into any detail about

993
00:42:20.759 --> 00:42:22.483
BALLE or--

994
00:42:23.058 --> 00:42:24.078
<v Blonde Woman>What I'd like to do is,</v>

995
00:42:24.078 --> 00:42:26.018
I would like to have everybody go to your website

996
00:42:26.018 --> 00:42:28.683
and then, begin exploring this.

997
00:42:29.064 --> 00:42:31.038
This is a handshake and an introduction

998
00:42:31.038 --> 00:42:33.337
to what you've done, which is absolutely wonderful.

999
00:42:33.337 --> 00:42:36.146
With what you're seeing right now,

1000
00:42:36.146 --> 00:42:38.875
you've already articulated a lot of the ways

1001
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:39.977
in which we can begin.

1002
00:42:39.977 --> 00:42:43.611
We can begin by non-cooperation, non-participation,

1003
00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:45.655
and then we can start building

1004
00:42:45.655 --> 00:42:47.373
via some of the structures perhaps

1005
00:42:47.373 --> 00:42:49.683
you and your colleagues have already developed.

1006
00:42:49.683 --> 00:42:51.286
We can begin developing something new,

1007
00:42:51.286 --> 00:42:53.478
but there is a--

1008
00:42:54.188 --> 00:42:56.800
we do have to have a certain amount of courage,

1009
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.563
and there's a certain risk that people

1010
00:42:59.563 --> 00:43:02.180
have to be willing to take in order to

1011
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.170
recreate a system that has become severely dysfunctional.

1012
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.236
Would you care to comment on that,

1013
00:43:08.236 --> 00:43:09.934
and the values that you do gain

1014
00:43:09.934 --> 00:43:12.945
from such an experience, before we wrap it up?

1015
00:43:13.249 --> 00:43:15.269
<v ->I think one of the things</v>

1016
00:43:15.269 --> 00:43:17.243
I like most about the work I'm doing,

1017
00:43:17.243 --> 00:43:18.880
is that it's fun.

1018
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.758
That when you work with your community

1019
00:43:22.758 --> 00:43:24.592
and you develop relationships,

1020
00:43:24.592 --> 00:43:25.893
that you know who bakes your bread,

1021
00:43:25.893 --> 00:43:27.321
and you know who brews your beer,

1022
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:31.894
and you know who's building your house, or whatever,

1023
00:43:31.894 --> 00:43:35.323
that there's a collective joy.

1024
00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:39.832
Especially if you have a shared vision for your community.

1025
00:43:40.778 --> 00:43:42.704
As we do on the national level,

1026
00:43:42.704 --> 00:43:43.877
that we have a shared vision

1027
00:43:43.877 --> 00:43:46.634
for what we're trying to do nationally.

1028
00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:50.330
BALLE meets once a year, we have an annual conference.

1029
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:51.691
Our eighth annual will be in

1030
00:43:51.691 --> 00:43:55.916
Charleston, South Carolina in 2010, May 21-23.

1031
00:43:55.916 --> 00:43:57.762
If folks want to find out more about us,

1032
00:43:57.762 --> 00:44:01.042
our website is livingeconomies.org.

1033
00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:04.635
Those who should come to our conference

1034
00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:07.433
include business owners to find out

1035
00:44:07.433 --> 00:44:10.603
what is the latest in terms of models

1036
00:44:10.603 --> 00:44:12.936
of local living economy enterprises,

1037
00:44:12.936 --> 00:44:15.537
what are the businesses we need to build a local economy,

1038
00:44:15.537 --> 00:44:19.008
the food processors, the textile producers,

1039
00:44:19.008 --> 00:44:23.049
the energy efficient folks, the renewable energy,

1040
00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:24.349
the alternative transportation:

1041
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:26.079
all these different types of businesses.

1042
00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:29.203
And this is, by the way, how we feel

1043
00:44:29.203 --> 00:44:31.060
that BALLE is reinventing growth,

1044
00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.323
that BALLE entrepreneurs are reinventing growth,

1045
00:44:33.323 --> 00:44:35.785
because not only do we grow in non-material ways

1046
00:44:35.785 --> 00:44:38.440
that I described earlier, but we also grow

1047
00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.197
by looking to see what does our community need.

1048
00:44:41.197 --> 00:44:42.961
So, rather than starting a new business

1049
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:45.771
that's a cookie-cutter chain in someone else's community,

1050
00:44:45.771 --> 00:44:48.670
we look to see, well, what does my community need?

1051
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.666
And a perfect example of this is

1052
00:44:50.666 --> 00:44:54.142
the Zingerman family of businesses in Ann Arbor.

1053
00:44:54.142 --> 00:44:55.547
It started with Zingerman Deli

1054
00:44:55.547 --> 00:44:57.718
and was a very successful, highly successful deli

1055
00:44:57.718 --> 00:44:58.751
that could have easily done

1056
00:44:58.751 --> 00:45:01.097
a chain of Zingerman Delis; they're famous.

1057
00:45:01.097 --> 00:45:03.151
But instead of doing a chain of Zingerman Delis,

1058
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:06.775
they said, "Our community doesn't have a bakery."

1059
00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:08.387
So they started a bakery.

1060
00:45:08.387 --> 00:45:12.998
They started a fair-trade, organic coffee roasting company.

1061
00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:17.490
They started a creamery, to make cheese and ice cream.

1062
00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.309
And they have a management consulting company,

1063
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:24.077
they have a full-service restaurant.

1064
00:45:24.077 --> 00:45:26.616
And now, they've started their own farm

1065
00:45:26.616 --> 00:45:28.415
to grow the tomatoes for the sandwiches

1066
00:45:28.415 --> 00:45:31.619
and to freeze-dry them, or sun-dry them, the tomatoes

1067
00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:33.151
for the wintertime and so on.

1068
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:35.183
So they've just begun!

1069
00:45:35.183 --> 00:45:37.343
But it's a different way of growing

1070
00:45:37.343 --> 00:45:40.489
that really serves your local community

1071
00:45:40.489 --> 00:45:43.229
and makes your local economy self-reliant.

1072
00:45:43.229 --> 00:45:46.027
And that's a really basic thing that we're trying to do,

1073
00:45:46.027 --> 00:45:49.149
whether it's helping the Zapatistas become self-reliant,

1074
00:45:49.149 --> 00:45:52.173
or really getting others out of their way,

1075
00:45:52.173 --> 00:45:53.469
because they've been self-reliant

1076
00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:56.718
for thousands of years, indigenous people have.

1077
00:45:58.008 --> 00:46:00.307
But we want to bring that back

1078
00:46:00.307 --> 00:46:01.282
to communities everywhere.

1079
00:46:01.282 --> 00:46:03.724
We feel that, if every community in the world

1080
00:46:03.724 --> 00:46:07.192
had food security, water security, and energy security

1081
00:46:07.192 --> 00:46:10.060
that that would create the foundation for world peace.

1082
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.325
<v Blonde Woman>You bet.</v>

1083
00:46:11.325 --> 00:46:13.392
Communities that are self-sustainable, as you say,

1084
00:46:13.392 --> 00:46:17.760
are not likely to engage in violent processes of any kind.

1085
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.968
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

1086
00:46:18.968 --> 00:46:20.326
<v Blonde Woman>So this is a great start.</v>

1087
00:46:20.326 --> 00:46:22.497
You're an incredible inspiration to people.

1088
00:46:22.497 --> 00:46:24.900
One person really can make

1089
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.897
a massive difference in the world,

1090
00:46:26.897 --> 00:46:28.140
and I thank you so much for taking

1091
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.939
a little bit of time to speak to us today.

1092
00:46:29.939 --> 00:46:31.861
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1093
00:46:35.949 --> 00:46:38.020
<v ->Judy's life is about encouraging others</v>

1094
00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.854
to become involved in their own way

1095
00:46:39.854 --> 00:46:41.549
in their own communities.

1096
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:43.151
To learn more about what she's up to,

1097
00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:45.852
you can go to her website at livingeconomies.org,

1098
00:46:45.852 --> 00:46:47.296
where she offers resources

1099
00:46:47.296 --> 00:46:50.396
to some 20,000 socially conscious entrepreneurs.

1100
00:46:50.396 --> 00:46:53.340
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
