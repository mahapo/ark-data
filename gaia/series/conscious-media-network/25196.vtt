(lively guitar music)

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:17.825
<v ->For decades, we've been reading about the progress</v>

3
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:20.631
of cold fusion technology, which is considered

4
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.130
a stable source of nuclear fusion at room temperature.

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.995
Many view it as the Holy Grail,

6
00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.331
the future energy source of humankind.

7
00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.348
Others have consistently sought to denigrate

8
00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.342
the potential of this technology.

9
00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:34.711
Regardless, it appears that cold fusion

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.145
may now be quietly emerging into the global marketplace

11
00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.427
beginning this year, 2012.

12
00:00:40.427 --> 00:00:42.838
No longer some faraway dream of providing people

13
00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:46.048
with clean, cheap, limitless energy throughout the planet,

14
00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:47.776
the emergence of cold fusion

15
00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.746
promises to fundamentally change the way we live.

16
00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:55.744
We talked earlier, in a separate interview,

17
00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:58.953
about an introduction of a new economic system

18
00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:02.729
that is on the horizon, that has huge implications,

19
00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.854
and in addition to that,

20
00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.434
just as significant

21
00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:12.567
in terms of the implications, is going to be, you're saying,

22
00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.359
and the people behind you are saying,

23
00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.464
is going to be the introduction, commercially,

24
00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.494
of cold fusion.

25
00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.448
Now, most people hearing that sentence are going to say,

26
00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:25.944
"No, no, no, no, that's been disproven.

27
00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:28.174
"The media has trashed cold fusion now

28
00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:30.189
"since Fleischmann-Pons,"

29
00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.012
their report came out, what? 1989.

30
00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:33.783
I remember reading it back then.

31
00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:35.756
I would like you to first give us some background

32
00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:38.829
as to when you entered this story,

33
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.927
when you were first made aware, 'cause I understand

34
00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:45.539
it was before the Fleischmann-Pons announcement in '89?

35
00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.957
And give us the background,

36
00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:48.399
set yourself up on this one.

37
00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:52.745
<v ->I started the cold fusion meme</v>

38
00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:54.988
for multiple reasons.

39
00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:58.065
<v Interviewer>When you say, "I started</v>

40
00:01:58.065 --> 00:02:00.391
"the cold fusion meme," what do you mean?

41
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.558
<v ->I am, like, the most public cheerleader for cold fusion</v>

42
00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:06.588
in the world that's not military, that's not scientist,

43
00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:07.461
that's nothing.

44
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:10.360
I'm like the trigger man for the public

45
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.291
getting involved with it, basically, and saying,

46
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.816
"Hey, we want this stuff."

47
00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:15.927
So that started,

48
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.169
I first remember hearing that Pons and Fleischmann did,

49
00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.834
I was driving in Palm Springs, and I heard it on the radio,

50
00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.658
and they made an announcement,

51
00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:27.537
and it was pooh-poohed almost immediately.

52
00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:30.947
I knew that those guys did it.

53
00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:33.036
I knew that they did it, because

54
00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:37.480
the description of how powerful the energy is,

55
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080
has detrimental effects to everything, it changes the entire

56
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.640
global playing field forever,

57
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.346
on multiple different levels.

58
00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:49.619
And I was driving in Palm Springs, I hear that,

59
00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.346
and I knew.

60
00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:54.301
I knew that, not only that that type of energy

61
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:57.564
and that type of concept was gonna be happening

62
00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.839
in my lifetime, but I had heard about it before

63
00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.748
from multiple people that were telling me,

64
00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:04.775
"There's no problems, we've got cold fusion now,

65
00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:06.705
"so everything's gonna be fine."

66
00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:09.245
And I had discussions,

67
00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:11.419
initially had the big discussions about it,

68
00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.393
when I was working with Walter Bowart,

69
00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.483
who wrote a book called Operation: Mind Control.

70
00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:19.099
I've spoken about that publicly before,

71
00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.517
and before his death,

72
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.850
we were looking

73
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.463
and examining the human being

74
00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:30.472
as a whole, and what was gonna happen

75
00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:33.074
when you integrate new technologies

76
00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:36.668
into the human beings and how they will react from them.

77
00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:41.668
Because there's obviously big technological ramifications

78
00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:43.891
and behavioral ramifications when you're introducing

79
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.355
new technology any place.

80
00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:48.424
And I always talk about on the radio,

81
00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:50.290
what happened when the cell phone came in?

82
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.193
It completely changed how people talk to each other,

83
00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:55.122
how people react to each other socially,

84
00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:57.298
including the amount of space they have between each other,

85
00:03:57.298 --> 00:03:59.699
completely, it's massive ramifications.

86
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.383
And that's just a cell phone.

87
00:04:01.383 --> 00:04:04.810
The shrinkage of the computer into a device that's now--

88
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.419
<v Interview>Where four people, a family can go</v>

89
00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.436
to brunch together with everyone on their cell phone.

90
00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:09.897
<v ->Yes, they're all looking down,</v>

91
00:04:09.897 --> 00:04:11.933
and nobody's talking to each other, right.

92
00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.451
We all go into coffee, put our head down, go on our device.

93
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:16.969
Any time there's any blank moment with anything,

94
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.920
and nobody's saying any, go to your device.

95
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.053
These little things that are going on.

96
00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:25.160
So cold fusion has massive, massive repercussions

97
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.538
on economics, on social living standards,

98
00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:32.524
cultures and how we deal with each other,

99
00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:34.272
war, everything.

100
00:04:34.272 --> 00:04:37.600
So I was discussing this with Walter Bowart

101
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.894
way before I went on the radio,

102
00:04:39.894 --> 00:04:41.708
and I knew that there was gonna be a day

103
00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:44.182
where this technology was gonna be

104
00:04:44.182 --> 00:04:47.933
finally repeatable, real,

105
00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:50.612
and on the global playing field, for certain.

106
00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.061
And before his death,

107
00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:00.053
he kind of said, "Here's my work.

108
00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:01.675
"Here's what you need to do.

109
00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:02.614
"Go ahead.

110
00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:04.906
"You can rectify what I have done,"

111
00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:07.574
because he was quite regretful about writing that book,

112
00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.866
Operation: Mind Control because of all the things

113
00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:12.086
that were entailed to it, but he was also interested

114
00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:15.094
in liberating the human species in general

115
00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:17.813
through whatever means necessary.

116
00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:20.352
One of the things I said the last time I talked to you

117
00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:22.193
on interviews is that, I told you,

118
00:05:22.193 --> 00:05:23.718
cold fusion is here,

119
00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:25.989
and at that time, it had not been confirmed.

120
00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:28.752
60 Minutes came out, and I e-mailed you and told you,

121
00:05:28.752 --> 00:05:30.950
said, "60 Minutes came out here," they said.

122
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.389
"We're here. We've arrived."

123
00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.914
And I told you we had it beforehand,

124
00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:35.514
and a lot of other people knew beforehand,

125
00:05:35.514 --> 00:05:37.044
way, way early.

126
00:05:37.044 --> 00:05:38.544
<v Interviewer>Yes, you did in our interview</v>

127
00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:40.280
a few years ago, you said, "This is imminent."

128
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.753
<v ->This is imminent. This is what's coming.</v>

129
00:05:41.753 --> 00:05:43.768
So the 60 Minutes interview came out,

130
00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:46.957
and that caused a big reaction

131
00:05:46.957 --> 00:05:48.888
to not only a lot of my listeners,

132
00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:50.776
'cause then they were like, "How does he know

133
00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:52.036
"what's going on here?"

134
00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.278
And then I started to examine

135
00:05:57.278 --> 00:06:01.459
and push the public into backing it,

136
00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.307
to support it, because I knew from interviewing

137
00:06:04.307 --> 00:06:05.620
all the scientists

138
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:09.456
that it was always money was always the issue.

139
00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:11.226
Money, and stuff that was going on

140
00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:12.345
in the intelligence world,

141
00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:15.012
in the military industrial complex, that was stopping

142
00:06:15.012 --> 00:06:18.074
the growth of this.

143
00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:20.825
Where is the money for R&amp;D?

144
00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:24.132
Just standard R&amp;D and money to put into something like this.

145
00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:27.705
I would think that if you can take a square foot of seawater

146
00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:30.429
and have enough power there to light up a small city

147
00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:32.198
for a long period of time.
<v Interviewer>You'd think</v>

148
00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:34.506
there'd have been a lot of R&amp;D money available.

149
00:06:34.506 --> 00:06:35.657
<v ->Like, instantly.</v>

150
00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:37.077
If everybody would've been like,

151
00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:38.014
you know,

152
00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:39.722
but that did not happen.

153
00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:42.091
That did not happen for years and years and years

154
00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:45.567
because of Pons and Fleischmann coming out

155
00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:47.828
and talking about this,

156
00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:49.118
and then their lives being ruined,

157
00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:51.742
and everybody else even touching the subject matter

158
00:06:51.742 --> 00:06:54.215
is an idiot, you're going against everything.

159
00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:56.015
<v Interviewer>Some of them are dead now, by the way.</v>

160
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.511
Some of them are dead.
<v ->People disappear and</v>

161
00:06:57.511 --> 00:06:59.415
are killed over this.
<v ->That is true as well.</v>

162
00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:02.928
And there's massive greed, and all the control freaks

163
00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:05.060
come out from all over the place,

164
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.012
because they all want to own it and run it.

165
00:07:07.012 --> 00:07:10.362
And the ramifications from old power structures

166
00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:11.908
in the past that have been running things,

167
00:07:11.908 --> 00:07:13.262
like that oil cartels.

168
00:07:13.262 --> 00:07:16.175
Bye, you're done. You're gonna be finished.

169
00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:18.698
And that's imminent, it's gonna happen sooner or later.

170
00:07:18.698 --> 00:07:21.321
It will be done, hopefully, cooperatively

171
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.084
without any violence or anything like that.

172
00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:28.125
So I was tying it into the nature of money,

173
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:30.802
what it's gonna do to money when you have free energy.

174
00:07:30.802 --> 00:07:33.022
<v Interviewer>Let's talk about that.</v>

175
00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:35.126
Let's just look at it by extension,

176
00:07:36.126 --> 00:07:38.981
what the impacts are going to be on the current paradigm

177
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:40.849
and life as we know it.

178
00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.185
What will shift around the introduction

179
00:07:43.185 --> 00:07:45.702
of literally limitless, free energy?

180
00:07:45.702 --> 00:07:46.609
<v ->Well,</v>

181
00:07:47.565 --> 00:07:51.969
I've gone into the media ecological ramifications

182
00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:55.742
of what the technology's gonna do to the average household,

183
00:07:56.742 --> 00:08:00.482
into do we have jobs still?

184
00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:02.544
What type of jobs are there gonna be now?

185
00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:04.214
<v Interviewer>Well now, why would jobs disappear</v>

186
00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:05.836
just because you have free energy?

187
00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:08.598
<v ->Well, because everything's consistent.</v>

188
00:08:08.598 --> 00:08:10.817
It doesn't stop and start, and you don't have to refill,

189
00:08:10.817 --> 00:08:11.949
for starters.

190
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.714
Computers will be on all the time.

191
00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:24.041
Your bills, you can drive forever in your car,

192
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:25.021
in the future.

193
00:08:26.023 --> 00:08:27.630
You're not limited by these things.

194
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.337
<v Interviewer>But that wouldn't necessarily mean</v>

195
00:08:29.337 --> 00:08:31.193
jobs dry up, because then you have to have the people

196
00:08:31.193 --> 00:08:33.432
that create the technology that accommodates it.

197
00:08:33.432 --> 00:08:34.626
<v ->It would be,</v>

198
00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:38.226
yeah, these are all the theoretical issues

199
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.338
that people would have to think about.

200
00:08:40.338 --> 00:08:41.757
Think tanks would get together and go,

201
00:08:41.757 --> 00:08:43.282
"Okay, how do we put it in this country

202
00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:44.583
"without destroying it?"

203
00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.677
Destroying the business of it, and everything like that.

204
00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:48.103
<v Interviewer>Yeah, the energy business,</v>

205
00:08:48.103 --> 00:08:50.265
in all its facets, that's a very big business,

206
00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:52.921
and the underpinnings, blue chip stocks, and so forth.

207
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:53.795
<v ->Right.</v>

208
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:57.743
But, looking at all the challenges that would bring,

209
00:08:58.858 --> 00:09:01.265
I always focus on

210
00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:03.473
the total liberation it will do

211
00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:07.399
for the end of pollution,

212
00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:11.152
the end of all the toxicity that we've had to deal with

213
00:09:11.152 --> 00:09:13.029
from the oil companies.

214
00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:14.715
<v Interviewer>Geopolitical wars.</v>

215
00:09:14.715 --> 00:09:16.588
<v ->Wars, I mean,</v>

216
00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:18.700
the last couple of wars have always been about oil

217
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.834
and nonsense and energy sources.

218
00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:22.177
And we can graduate.

219
00:09:22.177 --> 00:09:26.786
The human race can finally graduate onto this new level,

220
00:09:27.976 --> 00:09:29.016
and how that would happen.

221
00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:32.003
For as many people say, "Well, we can't have that

222
00:09:32.003 --> 00:09:33.613
"because it's gonna cancel out

223
00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:36.425
"all these other institutions,

224
00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:39.264
"and lessen their profit ratios," and things of that nature,

225
00:09:39.264 --> 00:09:40.619
I'm saying, "Well, wait a minute.

226
00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.571
"We're not gonna have any pollution anymore.

227
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:45.042
"We're not gonna have as many conflicts

228
00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:46.612
"as we've been having."

229
00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:48.068
<v Interviewer>And you have new industries</v>

230
00:09:48.068 --> 00:09:50.675
springing up around it, utilizing the new technologies.

231
00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:52.542
<v ->The jobs, I would think,</v>

232
00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:57.632
I would like to sit in a room with heads of state

233
00:09:57.632 --> 00:10:00.128
and see how they think about,

234
00:10:00.128 --> 00:10:01.685
in terms of the integration process,

235
00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.829
and do you create jobs out of cold fusion?

236
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:06.867
We have these devices, and now we have to implement them

237
00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:10.030
and integrate them into the culture

238
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.933
and create jobs out of that

239
00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.460
so that there's a cold fusion industry.

240
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.873
So we don't cancel everything in its path

241
00:10:18.873 --> 00:10:23.481
because the ramifications, still today, I feel,

242
00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:25.973
I know they're understood by the scientists

243
00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:27.917
who are believers that I've interviewed.

244
00:10:30.716 --> 00:10:33.192
But the public

245
00:10:33.192 --> 00:10:36.306
still hasn't caught onto this fact,

246
00:10:36.306 --> 00:10:37.377
that this has happened.

247
00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:38.247
With all the other stuff

248
00:10:38.247 --> 00:10:40.187
that's going on in the world.
<v ->No, they haven't but that's</v>

249
00:10:40.187 --> 00:10:42.887
been very deliberate, the media has trashed cold fusion

250
00:10:42.887 --> 00:10:45.840
from day one to make sure that it's a moot issue

251
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.812
in our minds.

252
00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.359
Like, "Oh, well, that one didn't work out."

253
00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:50.982
So we all sit, waiting for some crumbs to drop

254
00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:53.744
from some obscure source that there's a new energy source.

255
00:10:53.744 --> 00:10:55.355
This is going to be the future.

256
00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:56.838
<v ->Let the truth be the authority,</v>

257
00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:58.343
not the authority be the truth.

258
00:10:58.343 --> 00:11:00.029
<v Interviewer>Exactly. No, I would think that</v>

259
00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:02.375
the first people we might want to look at

260
00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.998
in terms of resistance would be the utility companies.

261
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.034
<v ->Sure, right.</v>

262
00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:08.017
And I've had conversations

263
00:11:08.017 --> 00:11:11.956
with the leaders in the United States

264
00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:16.159
and other places about just that,

265
00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:18.238
and they know that.

266
00:11:19.238 --> 00:11:22.327
They've struggled for years, years and years,

267
00:11:22.327 --> 00:11:26.836
to get the paradox of getting an investor

268
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.235
to the paradox of ownership

269
00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:32.539
of a technology
<v Interviewer>Who owns</v>

270
00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:33.508
free energy?

271
00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:34.848
<v ->How do you deal with that?</v>

272
00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:39.066
To, how do we distribute it

273
00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:42.223
without disrupting everything in its path?

274
00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:43.824
All those things are on the minds

275
00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:46.182
of the people that are doing this.

276
00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:47.620
And that's fine and everything,

277
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.554
but if we look at the positive sides, too,

278
00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:53.182
I think we can come to (laughs)

279
00:11:53.182 --> 00:11:55.204
<v Interviewer>What seems logical to me is,</v>

280
00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:58.990
if we're going to take this period

281
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.082
where we have to have this transition,

282
00:12:01.082 --> 00:12:03.972
you have existing power companies.

283
00:12:03.972 --> 00:12:05.977
It costs money to buy these devices.

284
00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:07.812
And we're gonna get into the actual,

285
00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:10.040
what's really going on here in a minute.

286
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.727
It costs money to buy these devices.

287
00:12:11.727 --> 00:12:15.017
Why wouldn't the utility companies just

288
00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:19.019
keep it going, keep the jobs flowing, and so forth?

289
00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:22.319
Invest in these technologies, and maybe lease them back

290
00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:24.891
for a very modest fee to a household.

291
00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:26.727
There are no energy costs beyond that.

292
00:12:26.727 --> 00:12:29.020
I mean, that kind of thing seems to me

293
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.773
to be a very logical involvement from their point of view

294
00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:35.748
once they get done pillaging this planet

295
00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:37.882
with these extraordinary energy rates.

296
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:40.271
<v ->Doing what we're doing now is what I wanted to open up</v>

297
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:41.840
so that people are ready for it,

298
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.056
there's discussion about it,

299
00:12:43.056 --> 00:12:45.087
there's as much open discussion about it

300
00:12:45.087 --> 00:12:47.306
so it's not shoved down the hole like it's been.

301
00:12:47.306 --> 00:12:49.055
'Cause the quieter everything is about it,

302
00:12:49.055 --> 00:12:50.784
I just got off the phone this morning about it,

303
00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:53.162
I'm saying, "Look, the last thing you want to do

304
00:12:53.162 --> 00:12:54.516
"is be quiet about this.

305
00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:57.054
"You want to be open, discussing it openly

306
00:12:57.054 --> 00:12:59.444
"so you protect everybody involved instead of

307
00:13:00.554 --> 00:13:01.797
"closing the doors and saying,

308
00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:03.442
"'No, we don't want to talk about that yet.

309
00:13:03.442 --> 00:13:04.906
"'We can't do this, we can't do that.'

310
00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:08.789
"I said, 'You can't. You can't do that 'cause I'm here.

311
00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.591
"'And I'm the one that's the big blabbermouth

312
00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:11.755
"'on the block.'"

313
00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:17.041
I'm doing it for completely, totally different purposes

314
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:19.738
than just the profit ratio,

315
00:13:19.738 --> 00:13:23.333
even though I've interviewed, recently,

316
00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:27.022
a patent attorney

317
00:13:27.022 --> 00:13:28.692
regarding ownership of this

318
00:13:28.692 --> 00:13:32.265
and how you equate that

319
00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:33.887
with law,

320
00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:36.383
and who's gonna control it?

321
00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:39.984
And how are they gonna control it? Is it gonna be shared?

322
00:13:39.984 --> 00:13:42.787
What is that gonna do for

323
00:13:42.787 --> 00:13:44.226
a country and an economy,

324
00:13:44.226 --> 00:13:46.498
and how is that even gonna be handled?

325
00:13:46.498 --> 00:13:48.631
And his opinion was, well, it can't be owned

326
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:49.815
by a single person.

327
00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:52.321
It's gonna have to be shared.

328
00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:55.551
<v Interviewer>We're talking about the patents</v>

329
00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:56.917
that have been applied for.

330
00:13:58.287 --> 00:14:00.890
They're saying this really can't be allocated

331
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.074
to any one source.

332
00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.216
<v ->That was his opinion as a lawyer and a patent attorney.</v>

333
00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:05.794
<v Interviewer>Yeah, and it's been bubbling up</v>

334
00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:07.561
all over the planet for decades.

335
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:09.671
This isn't just Fleischmann-Pons.

336
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:11.784
This has been bubbling up from many quarters

337
00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:12.915
around the planet.

338
00:14:12.915 --> 00:14:13.917
<v ->Right.</v>

339
00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:17.707
What I decided to do is,

340
00:14:17.707 --> 00:14:20.159
I did a coldfusionnow.org website,

341
00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:22.016
which is, I designed it,

342
00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:24.800
and put it out there

343
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.295
because I wanted the public

344
00:14:27.295 --> 00:14:28.735
to get involved with it.

345
00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:31.253
That website was not built by some company.

346
00:14:31.253 --> 00:14:32.532
I didn't pay to have it done.

347
00:14:32.532 --> 00:14:35.263
I wanted the people to activate themselves

348
00:14:35.263 --> 00:14:37.930
and build that website, and add onto it,

349
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.276
and write, and e-mail, and discussion groups.

350
00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:42.498
So I wanted the public involved,

351
00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:43.885
so what happened was,

352
00:14:43.885 --> 00:14:45.958
after I started interviewing all these scientists,

353
00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.454
I started having high schoolers call me up

354
00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.608
and say they want to get involved with this.

355
00:14:50.608 --> 00:14:52.827
We want this scientist to come to our school.

356
00:14:52.827 --> 00:14:55.908
I even had a situation where a young kid

357
00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:59.706
was going to get into the field of cold fusion,

358
00:14:59.706 --> 00:15:02.309
and they wanted Michael McKubre

359
00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:03.634
to come speak at his school.

360
00:15:03.634 --> 00:15:04.907
<v Interviewer>Who's Michael McKubre?</v>

361
00:15:04.907 --> 00:15:06.190
<v ->Michael McKubre is the gentleman</v>

362
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.308
that replicated cold fusion,

363
00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:10.570
the reaction that showed up in 60 Minutes.

364
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.023
He was one of the main people there.

365
00:15:13.023 --> 00:15:14.911
And what do you know? What happened?

366
00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:16.500
The school wouldn't allow that.

367
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.822
They stopped it.
<v ->You're kidding.</v>

368
00:15:17.822 --> 00:15:19.495
<v ->They stopped it.</v>

369
00:15:19.495 --> 00:15:21.096
I couldn't believe it.
<v ->I can't say I'm shocked.</v>

370
00:15:21.096 --> 00:15:23.355
<v ->I was all over the radio like, "What?</v>

371
00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:26.160
"Are learning institutions places of learning?

372
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.716
"Or complete, total, control freak," you know.

373
00:15:29.716 --> 00:15:31.017
<v Interviewer>Well, it doesn't matter</v>

374
00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:32.896
where the resistance is, these little kids,

375
00:15:32.896 --> 00:15:34.849
they already are dialed in

376
00:15:34.849 --> 00:15:37.482
to the new paradigm energies that are arising.

377
00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:39.745
And that new technology's going to be their buzz,

378
00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:41.206
that's going to be their future.

379
00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.136
So it's appropriate, they'll just have to work around

380
00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:45.472
in their private science club.

381
00:15:46.382 --> 00:15:48.114
<v ->During the process, while I was interviewing</v>

382
00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.489
all these scientists,

383
00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:51.281
'cause I wanted to hear all their opinions

384
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:53.660
on how much money do they think they need to get started,

385
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.611
why there's a problem,

386
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:58.876
why is there a problem with people studying

387
00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.337
and wanting to get into this field?

388
00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:03.290
Because previously, not today, but previously,

389
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.680
I had professors that I was talking to

390
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.633
that were really high profile people at MIT saying,

391
00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:10.640
"Don't get into the field of cold fusion.

392
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.453
"It'll kill your career.

393
00:16:12.453 --> 00:16:13.604
"Don't do it."

394
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.293
<v Interviewer>What was the rationale?</v>

395
00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:20.353
He was dealing himself with all the problematic issues

396
00:16:20.353 --> 00:16:22.477
of even talking about that,

397
00:16:22.477 --> 00:16:24.508
'cause it's been a career killer.

398
00:16:24.508 --> 00:16:26.224
<v Interviewer>Because the implications are really</v>

399
00:16:26.224 --> 00:16:27.575
almost beyond articulate.

400
00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:31.182
<v ->Exactly, so doing all these interviews</v>

401
00:16:31.182 --> 00:16:35.010
was to let the public hear about what these scientists

402
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.451
have to deal with,

403
00:16:36.451 --> 00:16:38.680
and also to activate their interest,

404
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.592
and also to support 'em.

405
00:16:41.592 --> 00:16:43.862
Because at the end of the day, it's the people,

406
00:16:43.862 --> 00:16:46.306
the public, that's really gonna push this through,

407
00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:47.340
as far as I'm concerned.

408
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.214
<v Interviewer>Demand it.</v>

409
00:16:48.214 --> 00:16:49.745
<v ->Oh, yeah. Absolutely.</v>

410
00:16:49.745 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Interviewer>And it's one thing to demand it</v>

411
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.714
when it's not there, but you're saying, it's here.

412
00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:54.746
<v ->Yeah, it's arrived now.</v>

413
00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:56.414
<v Interviewer>The difference is, it has arrived.</v>

414
00:16:56.414 --> 00:16:58.636
We're talking about nuclear fusion

415
00:16:58.636 --> 00:17:01.772
at room temperature in tiny little devices

416
00:17:01.772 --> 00:17:04.812
that can perpetually fuel your home

417
00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:07.084
'til the home falls down, or your town.

418
00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:08.764
<v ->Basically, right.</v>

419
00:17:08.764 --> 00:17:11.396
So that's a pretty major thing to deal with.

420
00:17:14.426 --> 00:17:18.415
During the process of interviewing all these scientists,

421
00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:20.388
I had a film crew come in,

422
00:17:20.388 --> 00:17:22.874
and they shot me

423
00:17:22.874 --> 00:17:25.124
for a film called True Believers.

424
00:17:25.124 --> 00:17:27.139
It's 137films.org.

425
00:17:27.139 --> 00:17:29.368
It's supposed to be coming actually out,

426
00:17:29.368 --> 00:17:30.894
I think final cut's available now.

427
00:17:30.894 --> 00:17:33.145
I think it's finished, according to their website.

428
00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:35.182
But they interviewed everybody,

429
00:17:35.182 --> 00:17:37.070
and they interviewed the meme that I started

430
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.067
and all the people, and even this high school kid,

431
00:17:40.067 --> 00:17:41.925
about all the people that know what's up,

432
00:17:41.925 --> 00:17:43.612
and all the controversy,

433
00:17:43.612 --> 00:17:46.876
and total power trips

434
00:17:46.876 --> 00:17:50.192
going on behind the scenes in the military

435
00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:52.758
and the State department, way, way high up,

436
00:17:52.758 --> 00:17:55.543
on all the ramifications that this deals with.

437
00:17:55.543 --> 00:17:58.551
And I think the public should be in on all of that.

438
00:17:58.551 --> 00:18:00.033
'Cause I have been on the phone

439
00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:02.701
with the CEO's of the companies,

440
00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.428
hearing what's going on, what they have to deal with,

441
00:18:06.428 --> 00:18:09.501
as well as what happens when investors show up.

442
00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:11.271
'Cause here's a whole other thing, is,

443
00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:13.543
how do you get investors to show up?

444
00:18:13.543 --> 00:18:16.210
To invest into a company,

445
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.508
and then not declare complete ownership

446
00:18:20.508 --> 00:18:22.119
and control of everything?

447
00:18:23.209 --> 00:18:24.872
How do you do that?

448
00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:27.200
There's a whole other thing going on there.

449
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.300
And the legalese, what is the legalese of that?

450
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.263
<v Interviewer>New rules need to be created,</v>

451
00:18:31.263 --> 00:18:32.874
so to speak.
<v ->Yeah, totally new rules.</v>

452
00:18:32.874 --> 00:18:34.362
So, this film,

453
00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:35.418
they shot this film,

454
00:18:35.418 --> 00:18:38.851
and I did a very obnoxious interview,

455
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:41.945
on purpose, by design,

456
00:18:41.945 --> 00:18:45.531
just because, on the air, I've always been talking about,

457
00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:49.404
in this society, you really need pattern interruption

458
00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:51.707
to get somebody's attention, you know?

459
00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:54.395
And I use that technique of pattern interruption

460
00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:56.412
in this interview because I wanted

461
00:18:56.412 --> 00:18:58.908
to get people's attention, because,

462
00:18:58.908 --> 00:19:02.385
little old me, did this small amount.

463
00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:04.806
But if some celebrity, I couldn't get any.

464
00:19:04.806 --> 00:19:08.091
I tried to get one of the actresses that was in The Saint,

465
00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:09.477
Elisabeth Shue,

466
00:19:09.477 --> 00:19:12.358
to come on and talk about her participation in The Saint.

467
00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:15.408
It's a good reference point, the movie The Saint,

468
00:19:15.408 --> 00:19:16.784
because it talks about cold fusion

469
00:19:16.784 --> 00:19:19.028
and all the stuff that goes along with it.

470
00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:21.364
And they didn't want to have anything to talk about it.

471
00:19:21.364 --> 00:19:23.724
Val Kilmer didn't want to have anything to talk about it.

472
00:19:23.724 --> 00:19:25.592
Paramount didn't want to have anything to talk about it.

473
00:19:25.592 --> 00:19:27.577
They were just out of it entirely.

474
00:19:27.577 --> 00:19:29.678
And getting public support,

475
00:19:29.678 --> 00:19:32.195
and getting, you know,

476
00:19:32.195 --> 00:19:33.943
all the green environment involved.

477
00:19:33.943 --> 00:19:35.427
I even had conversations

478
00:19:35.427 --> 00:19:39.181
with former presidential candidate David Cobb,

479
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:41.453
with the Green Party, and I told him, I said,

480
00:19:41.453 --> 00:19:44.008
"Look, if you guys are so green,

481
00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:46.518
"why don't you put this on your energy platform?"

482
00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.762
And at that point, it had not been confirmed and repeated,

483
00:19:49.762 --> 00:19:51.638
the experiment of cold fusion.

484
00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:53.143
Today, it is.

485
00:19:54.773 --> 00:19:57.113
He wasn't quite sure if he was gonna believe me

486
00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:58.382
about cold fusion or not,

487
00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:00.697
but I just called him recently and said,

488
00:20:00.697 --> 00:20:02.648
"Look, remember my conversation with you?

489
00:20:02.648 --> 00:20:03.939
"We've arrived now."

490
00:20:03.939 --> 00:20:05.890
So now, what we have is,

491
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:08.506
Mitt Romney running for president,

492
00:20:08.506 --> 00:20:09.807
is talking about cold fusion.

493
00:20:09.807 --> 00:20:11.696
We got people running for political office

494
00:20:11.696 --> 00:20:13.807
now including that into their model

495
00:20:13.807 --> 00:20:15.290
of what they're gonna do

496
00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:19.148
regarding energy in the future.

497
00:20:19.148 --> 00:20:20.087
That's starting.

498
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.599
I don't think Ron Paul's talked about it yet

499
00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:24.860
even though I'm gonna initiate

500
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.749
that he address that situation.

501
00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:30.263
So all of that activity is occurring.

502
00:20:31.474 --> 00:20:34.685
While I was on the air doing this interview,

503
00:20:34.685 --> 00:20:37.085
we shot it down at a studio.

504
00:20:37.085 --> 00:20:40.391
I was on the air, and I got confirmation

505
00:20:40.391 --> 00:20:44.061
from one of the scientists, Dr. Andrea Rossi,

506
00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:48.622
finally repeated the experiment,

507
00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.179
and proved it.

508
00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:52.108
This is the weird part of this,

509
00:20:52.108 --> 00:20:54.819
because even though everybody's proved it already,

510
00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:57.698
and scientists that I know that are highly reputable

511
00:20:57.698 --> 00:20:59.127
know that it's real,

512
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:02.453
there's still people that are saying,

513
00:21:02.453 --> 00:21:03.664
"Something's gotta be wrong.

514
00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:05.253
"It can't be happening. It can't be happening.

515
00:21:05.253 --> 00:21:06.319
"We don't believe it."

516
00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:08.001
Still, no matter what.

517
00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:11.084
That's been a continual thing since the very beginning.

518
00:21:11.084 --> 00:21:13.324
So now we've gone through this whole process.

519
00:21:14.384 --> 00:21:16.216
You think 60 Minutes would come out and confirm it,

520
00:21:16.216 --> 00:21:18.210
and everything'll be okay now, and relax,

521
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.970
everybody calm down.

522
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.474
It's okay now, we can relax.

523
00:21:21.474 --> 00:21:22.369
We're real.

524
00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:23.885
This is a real things that's happening.

525
00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:25.367
What are we gonna do next?

526
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.244
But that's still going on now,

527
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.207
there's still doubt out there.

528
00:21:29.207 --> 00:21:31.138
<v Interviewer>But it has been replicated.</v>

529
00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:33.004
There is a company that is claiming

530
00:21:33.004 --> 00:21:36.555
they're going to start producing 300,000 units of it,

531
00:21:36.555 --> 00:21:39.633
starting 2012 to make it available to members of the,

532
00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:42.766
it sounds like initially Greece and the European community.

533
00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:45.912
But I think part of the issue must still be that,

534
00:21:45.912 --> 00:21:47.491
even though it's been replicated,

535
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:50.051
you're talking some pretty interesting,

536
00:21:50.051 --> 00:21:51.619
substantial trade secrets here,

537
00:21:51.619 --> 00:21:52.920
and oftentimes, the inventor,

538
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.544
including Mr. Rossi himself,

539
00:21:55.544 --> 00:21:57.517
are not necessarily going to give it up.

540
00:21:57.517 --> 00:21:59.832
They're gonna tell you the mechanics, basically, of it,

541
00:21:59.832 --> 00:22:01.368
but they're not gonna give it up

542
00:22:01.368 --> 00:22:03.380
to a hundred percent extent.

543
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.277
<v ->Here we go back to the</v>

544
00:22:04.277 --> 00:22:05.542
ownership thing.
<v ->Then they're saying,</v>

545
00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:07.262
"Well, if it's real, you should certainly tell us

546
00:22:07.262 --> 00:22:08.776
"every little thing."
<v ->Exactly.</v>

547
00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:10.784
<v Interviewer>Coca-Cola hasn't even revealed that,</v>

548
00:22:10.784 --> 00:22:13.066
although I think it has leaked out on the net by now,

549
00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:15.721
but essentially, even Coke hasn't divulged a recipe,

550
00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:17.919
yet they're being slammed because they will not divulge

551
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.187
all of it
<v ->Here's what I would say</v>

552
00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:20.925
to that, and this is what I would say to that,

553
00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:22.231
and I've said this before,

554
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.850
and this is a real interesting property

555
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.268
that Marshall McClune brought up.

556
00:22:26.268 --> 00:22:27.837
When we went electric,

557
00:22:27.837 --> 00:22:30.097
and we went digital,

558
00:22:30.097 --> 00:22:32.987
there cannot be any secrets under a digital environment.

559
00:22:32.987 --> 00:22:35.216
There'll only be a misdirection.

560
00:22:35.216 --> 00:22:37.758
So all secrets are gonna come out.

561
00:22:38.758 --> 00:22:40.037
How they come out

562
00:22:40.037 --> 00:22:42.121
is dependent on the person that's perceiving them

563
00:22:42.121 --> 00:22:43.556
because most of the things, the big secrets

564
00:22:43.556 --> 00:22:45.776
that are coming out are, they'll put them out on TV shows

565
00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:46.901
or something that'll cover it up.

566
00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:48.062
Oh, that was just on a TV show,

567
00:22:48.062 --> 00:22:49.588
and that's how they discredit it.

568
00:22:51.398 --> 00:22:53.265
I know about the company that you're talking about

569
00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:56.103
that says they found what Rossi's mechanism is

570
00:22:56.103 --> 00:22:57.404
for cold fusion.

571
00:22:57.404 --> 00:22:58.481
<v Interviewer>Defkalion.</v>

572
00:22:58.481 --> 00:22:59.779
<v ->Defkalion, right.</v>

573
00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:01.784
We're release that on coldfusionnow.org,

574
00:23:01.784 --> 00:23:04.269
and I've had conversations with the webmaster

575
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:06.540
who does that about that,

576
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.250
and my answer to that was, "Good. Good."

577
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.789
Is that, the more publicity cold fusion gets,

578
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:16.306
and the more competition that's created,

579
00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:18.630
and the more there's a need for this information

580
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.617
to come out, I think everybody wins.

581
00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:25.265
Because right at the initial stage where we're at,

582
00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:28.849
in the last couple of days, I've had conversations

583
00:23:28.849 --> 00:23:30.470
with the top US company,

584
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.620
I've had conversations with Rossi himself.

585
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.520
I've had conversations with publicists

586
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.186
that want to blow this story out,

587
00:23:40.186 --> 00:23:42.213
and would everybody cooperate

588
00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:45.222
to put a big story out regarding this?

589
00:23:45.222 --> 00:23:47.013
And what is it gonna take to do that?

590
00:23:47.013 --> 00:23:49.979
Well, we wanna see this, and we want this, and we want this,

591
00:23:49.979 --> 00:23:52.165
and it's gotta be this before I do this.

592
00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:54.138
And we're not gonna give this amount of money

593
00:23:54.138 --> 00:23:55.781
until we're sure this is.

594
00:23:55.781 --> 00:23:57.817
So everybody's like,

595
00:23:57.817 --> 00:23:59.327
where is everybody gonna make their move?

596
00:23:59.327 --> 00:24:00.820
That's where it's at right now.

597
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.239
Now, before I arrived here,

598
00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:07.566
I spoke with one of the representatives

599
00:24:07.566 --> 00:24:09.720
of Dr. Andrea Rossi

600
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.033
about a proposal that was given to me

601
00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:16.747
also in the last 48 hours

602
00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:21.175
about a very powerful organization

603
00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:24.638
that, shall we say, is a bunch of people

604
00:24:24.638 --> 00:24:27.528
that want to see these advanced technologies come out.

605
00:24:27.528 --> 00:24:32.381
These are made of up lawyers, philanthropists, celebrities,

606
00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:34.173
big, huge, powerful group.

607
00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:38.012
And he said, "Well, we want you to broker

608
00:24:38.012 --> 00:24:40.729
"the first deal for cold fusion.

609
00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.730
"And we want you to go to Rossi,

610
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.058
"and we want to basically

611
00:24:47.448 --> 00:24:50.812
"integrate, as quickly as possible,

612
00:24:50.812 --> 00:24:53.437
"with the necessary money and everything,

613
00:24:53.437 --> 00:24:57.124
"this technology into said countries."

614
00:24:57.124 --> 00:24:58.691
And the person that was telling me this

615
00:24:58.691 --> 00:25:00.334
was completely serious about it.

616
00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:03.470
So before I decided to talk here, I figured

617
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.116
I would have this discussion this morning with these guys.

618
00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:10.100
Here's what I would say,

619
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.983
'cause I decided to keep the conversation confidential

620
00:25:13.983 --> 00:25:17.573
that I had with Rossi's people, abide by that.

621
00:25:17.573 --> 00:25:19.642
But as far as the public's concerned,

622
00:25:19.642 --> 00:25:21.434
and this group that came to me,

623
00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:25.434
they want the fastest initiation

624
00:25:25.434 --> 00:25:27.509
of cold fusion as possible,

625
00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:30.127
and the money's not an issue.

626
00:25:30.127 --> 00:25:31.514
They got the money.

627
00:25:31.514 --> 00:25:34.562
They want it installed, they want to end the paradigm,

628
00:25:35.792 --> 00:25:37.760
essentially end the paradigm of oil

629
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.140
and all these other things, and let's get on with the show,

630
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.221
so to speak, in 2012, let's start this new world.

631
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:46.133
That's where it stands right now.

632
00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:47.855
Now, by the time people see this.

633
00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:49.530
<v Interviewer>Who knows what will have happened?</v>

634
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.871
There's so much subterfuge and infighting,

635
00:25:51.871 --> 00:25:54.655
and people making claims against the other.

636
00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:56.501
I mean, what I had read,

637
00:25:56.501 --> 00:25:59.466
and it was through some of the links on your website,

638
00:26:00.906 --> 00:26:02.830
and some other websites, there's a dispute

639
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:07.096
that Mr. Rossi's technology was licensed

640
00:26:07.096 --> 00:26:09.368
to the Greek company we spoke of earlier,

641
00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:11.949
and now they're saying he rescinded the rights to it.

642
00:26:11.949 --> 00:26:14.328
I mean, even this. Well, they're already announcing

643
00:26:14.328 --> 00:26:16.777
that these models are already being made,

644
00:26:16.777 --> 00:26:19.017
and they're going to be released into the public

645
00:26:19.017 --> 00:26:21.491
for their consumption starting this year,

646
00:26:21.491 --> 00:26:23.996
starting 2012, this year.
<v ->Yes.</v>

647
00:26:23.996 --> 00:26:27.355
<v Interviewer>You're gonna see a lot of, hm,</v>

648
00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:30.788
countervailing stories about the insiders backbiting

649
00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:31.782
that's going on.

650
00:26:31.782 --> 00:26:33.861
So people need to be aware, when you start researching this,

651
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:35.280
it's fraught with this.

652
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.562
<v ->Yeah, on the safe, for the record,</v>

653
00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:42.048
that there are interests that do not want this to come out,

654
00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:46.143
and last week, I dealt with that hands on.

655
00:26:46.143 --> 00:26:50.592
'Cause I had a conversation with somebody about it.

656
00:26:52.991 --> 00:26:57.558
They even suggested, "You should really watch yourself

657
00:26:57.558 --> 00:26:58.838
"before talking about this."

658
00:26:58.838 --> 00:27:00.279
And I'm like, "I don't care."

659
00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:02.891
I really don't. It's past that.

660
00:27:02.891 --> 00:27:04.386
It's way past that now.

661
00:27:04.386 --> 00:27:07.010
Everybody knows about it, they can find out about it,

662
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.047
and I said, "The more public everybody is about it,

663
00:27:09.047 --> 00:27:11.948
"the more supportive it is, the better off everybody is

664
00:27:11.948 --> 00:27:13.334
"having to do with that subject matter,"

665
00:27:13.334 --> 00:27:17.313
because there is conversations

666
00:27:17.313 --> 00:27:20.394
from competitors that even said to me, "You know,

667
00:27:20.394 --> 00:27:22.795
"I think Rossi's a scam.

668
00:27:22.795 --> 00:27:25.841
"This is between just you and I, somethings' wrong there."

669
00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:27.301
And I'm like, "Yeah, of course.

670
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:28.507
"You're a scam too.

671
00:27:28.507 --> 00:27:29.542
"The whole thing's a scam.

672
00:27:29.542 --> 00:27:31.024
"You're just greedy."

673
00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:33.850
Everybody wants to control the whole thing

674
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.067
and own the whole thing.

675
00:27:35.067 --> 00:27:37.222
And because they want credit for having done it

676
00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:39.109
to prop up their identity and everything else

677
00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:40.305
in the android meme.

678
00:27:40.305 --> 00:27:41.570
<v Interviewer>Sure, this is big.</v>

679
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.622
This is paradigm-changing.

680
00:27:42.622 --> 00:27:44.990
This goes down in history, of course everybody wants

681
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.825
to have their piece, they want to have their name on it,

682
00:27:46.825 --> 00:27:48.200
they want to profit from it

683
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.152
'cause we haven't exactly changed.

684
00:27:51.762 --> 00:27:53.631
We haven't made that transition just yet.

685
00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:56.883
So let's look at the practical element of it.

686
00:27:56.883 --> 00:27:59.540
You say that you were approached in the last 48 hours

687
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.932
to become a distributor?

688
00:28:01.932 --> 00:28:03.134
<v ->Well, broker the deal.</v>

689
00:28:03.134 --> 00:28:04.931
<v Interviewer>Broker of a deal for this technology.</v>

690
00:28:04.931 --> 00:28:07.896
Is this at a commercial level? At a governmental level?

691
00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:13.273
<v ->I had this conversation over Skype.</v>

692
00:28:13.273 --> 00:28:16.763
Then, ten minutes later, I got a message on Skype saying,

693
00:28:17.713 --> 00:28:19.528
"What I'd really like to do is this."

694
00:28:19.528 --> 00:28:21.326
It was like a much bigger chunk.

695
00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:24.538
Basically, this person wants to amass

696
00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:27.182
a insertion of cash and cooperation

697
00:28:27.182 --> 00:28:28.589
from this particular group,

698
00:28:28.589 --> 00:28:31.575
and then have a big press conference,

699
00:28:31.575 --> 00:28:33.581
and then start distributing it.

700
00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:36.003
<v Interviewer>Distributing it to us?</v>

701
00:28:36.003 --> 00:28:38.680
To individual households, or for commercial use only?

702
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.959
<v ->Just starting it.</v>

703
00:28:39.959 --> 00:28:41.324
<v Interviewer>Just starting it, okay.</v>

704
00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:43.201
<v ->Whether it's in use for industrial use,</v>

705
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:45.356
or in the home.

706
00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:48.215
Just beginning it, take the first step, type of thing.

707
00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:49.761
And everything else will follow.

708
00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:52.142
That was the request,

709
00:28:52.142 --> 00:28:55.602
and I have yet to follow up

710
00:28:55.602 --> 00:28:59.245
to determine how, logistically, you would even do that.

711
00:28:59.245 --> 00:29:00.866
I mean, he has all the assets and everything

712
00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:02.754
and people behind him to do that.

713
00:29:05.774 --> 00:29:09.579
The real issue, after that conversation,

714
00:29:09.579 --> 00:29:13.367
is to have it such that

715
00:29:13.367 --> 00:29:16.557
the people that have it, Rossi,

716
00:29:18.069 --> 00:29:21.994
'cause a lot of people want to see him fail, obviously,

717
00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:26.415
but is to support him regardless of what the situation is,

718
00:29:26.415 --> 00:29:29.242
'cause if you take him down again,

719
00:29:29.242 --> 00:29:32.202
this thing will go behind for another 10 years.

720
00:29:32.202 --> 00:29:34.369
It'll go back to sleep for a long time.

721
00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:36.380
<v Interviewer>Well, what about the other players, though,</v>

722
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.134
that are trying out the same technology?

723
00:29:38.134 --> 00:29:40.106
I mean, he isn't the only game, is he?

724
00:29:40.106 --> 00:29:41.035
<v ->No, he's not.</v>

725
00:29:41.035 --> 00:29:43.819
There's other people, but they always have finance problems,

726
00:29:43.819 --> 00:29:44.939
financial issues.

727
00:29:44.939 --> 00:29:47.248
I know guys that just need, if they had 10 million,

728
00:29:47.248 --> 00:29:49.313
"I could repeat it for these people, and they could see,

729
00:29:49.313 --> 00:29:50.860
"and then I got something going on."

730
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.428
<v Interviewer>So the deal is, he's got money,</v>

731
00:29:52.428 --> 00:29:53.847
he has money behind him right now?

732
00:29:53.847 --> 00:29:54.806
<v ->Yes.</v>

733
00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:57.363
<v Interviewer>So that's the best chance, at the moment,</v>

734
00:29:57.363 --> 00:29:59.336
of this coming out more rapidly.

735
00:29:59.336 --> 00:30:00.733
<v ->The best thing I would say is,</v>

736
00:30:01.963 --> 00:30:04.033
for everybody concerned,

737
00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:06.497
is the public needs to support this.

738
00:30:06.497 --> 00:30:07.757
They need to talk about it.

739
00:30:07.757 --> 00:30:09.265
They need to talk about it in schools.

740
00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.815
They need to talk about it with their friends.

741
00:30:10.815 --> 00:30:12.731
They gotta talk about it with their social leaders.

742
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:14.822
They gotta talk about it with their presidential candidates.

743
00:30:14.822 --> 00:30:18.043
We've gotta totally say, "We want it, we want it now."

744
00:30:19.255 --> 00:30:21.100
That's why I did coldfusionnow,

745
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.479
not coldfusionyesterday or a week from now,

746
00:30:23.479 --> 00:30:26.732
coldfusionnow.org, so that people would get that.

747
00:30:26.732 --> 00:30:28.534
<v Interviewer>And, again, looking at it</v>

748
00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:30.753
from how it might show up in our lives,

749
00:30:30.753 --> 00:30:32.705
if you go to the Defkalion video,

750
00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:35.115
their announcement in Greece that was made,

751
00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:37.558
the ones that say they're going to be in production

752
00:30:37.558 --> 00:30:41.621
to the tune of over 300,000 units by the end of 2012,

753
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:44.224
and they're saying these are used for commercial purposes,

754
00:30:44.224 --> 00:30:46.758
and also for private residences, potentially,

755
00:30:46.758 --> 00:30:49.200
because they're broken down into small units

756
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.870
that essentially generate one kilowatt of energy,

757
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.795
and those units, just to give some of what they're claiming

758
00:30:56.795 --> 00:30:58.768
in terms of a dollar sign

759
00:30:58.768 --> 00:31:00.043
to the whole thing.
<v James>Good.</v>

760
00:31:00.043 --> 00:31:01.522
<v Interviewer>They're talking about, like,</v>

761
00:31:01.522 --> 00:31:04.820
two thousand dollars per each module, that's one kilowatt,

762
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.666
and an average household probably,

763
00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:08.393
depending on your peak needs, need anywhere

764
00:31:08.393 --> 00:31:10.101
from three to six of these.

765
00:31:10.101 --> 00:31:11.240
That's cheap.

766
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.883
<v ->It should be cheap.
<v Interviewer>For energy</v>

767
00:31:12.883 --> 00:31:15.418
for the rest of your life, that's pretty cheap to install.

768
00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:16.761
<v ->They're talking that,</v>

769
00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:18.746
that means it's a good sign, because somebody's gonna

770
00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:20.503
want to go, "We're gonna do it for cheaper then."

771
00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:22.806
<v Interviewer>Exactly, that's just the first round.</v>

772
00:31:22.806 --> 00:31:24.053
<v ->Right, that's just the first round.</v>

773
00:31:24.053 --> 00:31:28.353
It's just getting started, all the mayhem, competition.

774
00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:31.249
No, "We're $59.95."

775
00:31:31.249 --> 00:31:34.663
"We're doing it for free. Period."

776
00:31:34.663 --> 00:31:36.411
Which is what I'd like to see, but, you know,

777
00:31:36.411 --> 00:31:37.649
that's what's starting.

778
00:31:37.649 --> 00:31:39.153
The competition is starting.

779
00:31:40.563 --> 00:31:43.331
I had that conversation with Ed Storm,

780
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:47.460
who's the first scientist that I initially interviewed

781
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.944
regarding that, and I have to thank him

782
00:31:49.944 --> 00:31:51.726
because he set me up,

783
00:31:51.726 --> 00:31:53.986
because of me interviewing him, it was McKubre

784
00:31:53.986 --> 00:31:55.512
and everybody else that followed,

785
00:31:55.512 --> 00:31:58.435
that liked the fact

786
00:31:58.435 --> 00:32:01.112
that I supported them, because they have been like outcasts

787
00:32:01.112 --> 00:32:02.210
in society.

788
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.344
In some cases, their careers have been ruined,

789
00:32:04.344 --> 00:32:06.092
but people like Ed Storm,

790
00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:08.471
he's got a totally different vantage point.

791
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:09.793
He's kind of like us.

792
00:32:09.793 --> 00:32:11.596
He has a spiritual vantage point.

793
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.646
He wants to see this happen during his lifetime

794
00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:17.996
and his children's so that we can free ourselves

795
00:32:17.996 --> 00:32:20.907
from the other mayhem

796
00:32:20.907 --> 00:32:22.001
that we've been dealing with.

797
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:23.420
<v Interviewer>Absolutely. Not only that,</v>

798
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.087
it levels the playing field, in a lot of ways, globally,

799
00:32:26.087 --> 00:32:28.102
in terms of the people who have been

800
00:32:28.102 --> 00:32:29.906
in very disadvantaged positions.

801
00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:33.158
And that energy has been a big problem,

802
00:32:33.158 --> 00:32:36.443
supplying energy to those in third world nations

803
00:32:36.443 --> 00:32:38.683
has been a great challenge

804
00:32:38.683 --> 00:32:41.509
which has totally limited their ability

805
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:44.721
to produce goods to services and so forth.

806
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:47.415
And so this would level that playing field.

807
00:32:47.415 --> 00:32:51.158
Everybody would have access to energy on this planet

808
00:32:51.158 --> 00:32:52.961
for whatever use they need it for.

809
00:32:52.961 --> 00:32:57.089
<v ->That, in itself, changes everything.</v>

810
00:32:57.089 --> 00:33:00.138
Overnight, we've arrived there now,

811
00:33:00.138 --> 00:33:02.497
and the best thing the public can do

812
00:33:02.497 --> 00:33:06.294
is support Rossi, support other scientists.

813
00:33:07.344 --> 00:33:12.283
I've talked to lots of people with money,

814
00:33:12.283 --> 00:33:15.066
and I would just say, with the people with money

815
00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:17.243
that wanna do something great,

816
00:33:19.473 --> 00:33:22.700
don't look at it as if you're gonna own it.

817
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.177
Look at it as if you're gonna be--

818
00:33:24.177 --> 00:33:25.872
<v Interviewer>Contributing.</v>
<v ->You're contributing</v>

819
00:33:25.872 --> 00:33:27.543
to the human condition,

820
00:33:27.543 --> 00:33:28.990
the human species.

821
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.347
You will be remembered forever

822
00:33:31.347 --> 00:33:33.940
by your assistants.

823
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.151
I know of some name name people

824
00:33:37.151 --> 00:33:40.808
that are coming to California to look at this stuff

825
00:33:40.808 --> 00:33:42.427
that could just (smacks lips)

826
00:33:42.427 --> 00:33:44.677
and it would be launched.

827
00:33:47.685 --> 00:33:48.544
The only reason

828
00:33:50.449 --> 00:33:53.254
doubt and the counterintelligence business,

829
00:33:53.254 --> 00:33:55.995
it's a big business to create doubt

830
00:33:55.995 --> 00:33:57.990
and to discredit people and all those other things,

831
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.399
but this, I would say,

832
00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:03.105
it's the political equalizer.

833
00:34:03.105 --> 00:34:06.049
I interviewed somebody from parliament in Iceland

834
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:08.406
about this, and the reason why I did is because

835
00:34:08.406 --> 00:34:10.197
that was the only country that said no

836
00:34:10.197 --> 00:34:12.939
to what was going on with the banking stuff.

837
00:34:12.939 --> 00:34:15.051
Yeah, so I interviewed her about it,

838
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:18.571
and she absolutely is completely supportive of it,

839
00:34:18.571 --> 00:34:20.619
backed me up completely,

840
00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:23.914
and said this is the great equalizer for the human race.

841
00:34:23.914 --> 00:34:26.926
<v Interviewer>Absolutely. And it takes the human race</v>

842
00:34:26.926 --> 00:34:30.360
into space in a whole new way for exploring

843
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.773
new territories beyond our physical boundaries here.

844
00:34:33.773 --> 00:34:37.805
And it sounds like the technology essentially has arrived.

845
00:34:37.805 --> 00:34:40.439
It's been replicated, there are now working models

846
00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:43.689
that are being created, it's a just add money.

847
00:34:43.689 --> 00:34:45.780
Beyond the just add money part,

848
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.054
we all have to find our way there ourselves because,

849
00:34:49.054 --> 00:34:51.390
as you say, this is a melee

850
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:52.873
that starts now.

851
00:34:52.873 --> 00:34:56.698
<v ->Yeah, I remember when the first microwave ovens came out.</v>

852
00:34:56.698 --> 00:34:59.422
They were huge, and heavy, and massive,

853
00:34:59.422 --> 00:35:01.086
and everybody wanted to get one.

854
00:35:01.086 --> 00:35:03.262
You know, like with anything, it's gonna be improved.

855
00:35:03.262 --> 00:35:04.819
It'll get better,

856
00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:07.325
but an initial start things is like,

857
00:35:09.225 --> 00:35:10.903
it's not a financial thing to me.

858
00:35:10.903 --> 00:35:13.886
It's a spiritual issue, really.

859
00:35:13.886 --> 00:35:15.816
It's the old thing.

860
00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:18.174
I'm gonna have it all, and I'll give you some,

861
00:35:18.174 --> 00:35:21.160
but you gotta give me some, then I'm gonna give you some,

862
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.187
and I'm gonna charge you for it, and interest.

863
00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:24.687
No, no, no, all that stuff.

864
00:35:24.687 --> 00:35:27.951
<v Interviewer>This is free energy.</v>

865
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:30.436
Now, the interface between us and that free energy

866
00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:32.441
and tapping it for our own use

867
00:35:32.441 --> 00:35:35.556
is still up for debate in terms of, as you say,

868
00:35:35.556 --> 00:35:38.990
how this rolls out, but ultimately, this is free energy.

869
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.185
<v ->Yeah, this is--</v>

870
00:35:40.185 --> 00:35:41.401
<v Interviewer>It's the Holy Grail.</v>

871
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:44.317
<v ->the next step for the entire human race.</v>

872
00:35:44.317 --> 00:35:46.878
So I'm happy to have

873
00:35:48.356 --> 00:35:50.542
pushed it forward, but I can't do it alone.

874
00:35:50.542 --> 00:35:51.586
It's got other people.

875
00:35:51.586 --> 00:35:53.305
And by the time this comes out,

876
00:35:53.305 --> 00:35:56.355
I already know, I can tell talking to you right now,

877
00:35:56.355 --> 00:35:57.475
when this comes out,

878
00:35:57.475 --> 00:35:59.118
something that was major will have happened

879
00:35:59.118 --> 00:36:00.525
by the time it comes out.

880
00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:03.139
I can tell just from the phone conversations this morning.

881
00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:04.845
<v Interviewer>Okay, well.</v>

882
00:36:04.845 --> 00:36:07.554
To be revealed, to be continued as well.

883
00:36:07.554 --> 00:36:09.240
And, James, thank you so much.

884
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.421
Any final thoughts, or was that it?

885
00:36:11.421 --> 00:36:14.472
<v ->That basically sums it up, and I would just say</v>

886
00:36:16.195 --> 00:36:19.971
to everybody that's watching, if you circulate this

887
00:36:19.971 --> 00:36:22.083
or however people get this message out,

888
00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:24.973
that there are good things happening

889
00:36:24.973 --> 00:36:29.709
despite the flooding of bad news that we see.

890
00:36:29.709 --> 00:36:32.546
There are great things happening right now

891
00:36:32.546 --> 00:36:34.317
that are making the world a better place.

892
00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.001
So everybody keep their chin up,

893
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:38.944
and help each other.

894
00:36:38.944 --> 00:36:40.535
<v Interviewer>And what an appropriate message</v>

895
00:36:40.535 --> 00:36:42.268
on this, the dawning of 2012,

896
00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:43.771
the much anticipated 2012.

897
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:44.796
<v ->Right on.</v>

898
00:36:44.796 --> 00:36:46.236
<v ->Thank you so much, James.
<v ->All right.</v>

00:36:48.826 --> 00:36:51.272
To begin learning more about the history of cold fusion,

901
00:36:51.272 --> 00:36:53.928
you can go to coldfusionnow.org.

902
00:36:53.928 --> 00:36:56.124
This will kickstart your research into a world

903
00:36:56.124 --> 00:36:58.620
both intensely fascinating and intriguing,

904
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.222
more importantly, a view into what appears to be

905
00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:02.812
our very near future,

906
00:37:02.812 --> 00:37:06.001
one free from dependence on outside sources of energy

907
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:08.358
and pollution of our precious planet.

908
00:37:08.358 --> 00:37:10.811
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
