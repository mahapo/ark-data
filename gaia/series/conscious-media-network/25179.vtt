(light jazzy music)

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.114
<v ->For decades there have been people who have</v>

3
00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:13.765
attempted to bring science and spiritual

4
00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.735
consciousness together if not science and religion.

5
00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.937
Bernard Haisch author of The God Theory

6
00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:20.906
and now The Purpose-Driven Universe,

7
00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.684
is an astrophysicist who has spent decades

8
00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.479
looking at the underlying principles of creation.

9
00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.179
To the chagrin of some of his colleagues,

10
00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.325
he says the most fundamental questions

11
00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:32.541
cannot be answered without acknowledging

12
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.420
the presence of an intelligence

13
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.538
or divine order within the universe.

14
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.559
Bernard, you're in a field that has a lot of resistance

15
00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.047
to opening up to new concepts, especially in

16
00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:48.100
the subject of in the realm of consciousness.

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.802
This is so hotly contested across many

18
00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:54.105
areas of science, particularly in your area.

19
00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:57.442
So I wanted to find out on a very personal level for you,

20
00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:01.796
what was your original impetus or inspiration to try

21
00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:05.947
to reconcile spirituality

22
00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:09.254
with science in this arena as an astrophysicist?

23
00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:11.757
<v ->I guess in the desire to see if there's some kind of</v>

24
00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:14.225
reconciliation between science and spirituality

25
00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:15.727
goes all the back to my childhood

26
00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:17.396
cus when I was a young boy I knew that

27
00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:19.464
there were two things I wanted to be in life.

28
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.967
A priest and an astronomer (laughs).

29
00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:24.937
So I was a very scrupulous little, catholic alter boy.

30
00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:27.740
Went to a seminary, pretty much believed in God,

31
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.474
and at the same time wanted to become a scientist too.

32
00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:33.078
That's possible to do there are in fact

33
00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:36.217
Jesuit astronomers who do very modern research.

34
00:01:36.217 --> 00:01:38.316
But anyway I had both these things in mind

35
00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:41.553
from the time I was just starting grade school really.

36
00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:43.755
So it never seemed incompatible to me to think that

37
00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:45.690
there's a way to combine these things.

38
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.506
Although even later on when I left the seminary,

39
00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.196
and got engaged in scientific research, I realized that,

40
00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:54.333
well most of that world, most of that community,

41
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.403
was not really interested at all in spiritual questions.

42
00:01:57.403 --> 00:02:00.104
So it has been kind of a bit of a struggle

43
00:02:00.104 --> 00:02:03.042
to keep an equilibrium when the community

44
00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:06.144
you're working with is opposed to some of

45
00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:08.379
the fundamental ideas that I think are important.

46
00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.299
<v Regina>We were talking off camera just a moment ago,</v>

47
00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.020
about the fact that if we can't begin to acknowledge

48
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.990
that some kind of pervasive consciousness exists

49
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.532
which seems like just a really base level

50
00:02:21.532 --> 00:02:24.603
area to enter,

51
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:28.300
then how viable are a lot of these

52
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.403
sciences that exist today because if you start looking

53
00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:33.971
at the work of many people we've interviewed,

54
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:36.876
Dean Radin and some of his experiments and such,

55
00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:39.678
you can't seem to separate consciousness

56
00:02:39.678 --> 00:02:42.814
from any of the fields of science from life.

57
00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:45.583
<v ->Well remember though that science has got</v>

58
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:47.853
a track record of success, I mean the fact that we're

59
00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:49.989
sitting here talking and being filmed right now

60
00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.924
is certainly an indication that science works.

61
00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:54.326
The car you drive, the computer that we all use.

62
00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:56.361
So science has got a lot to be proud of

63
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:58.830
and it can keep scientists busy for decades

64
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.332
working on these thing and discoveries in astrophysics,

65
00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:03.401
for example the discover of dark energy.

66
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.570
It's a major discovery and so there's lots and lots

67
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.039
of stuff within the purely physical realm

68
00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.074
that can keep scientists very busy and occupied

69
00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:12.143
and result in things that benefit society

70
00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:14.213
and demonstrate for sure that science works

71
00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:17.516
to keep them sort of engaged and away from

72
00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:19.451
the other topics that in the long run may prove

73
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.753
to be more significant, but right now

74
00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.090
things like consciousness--
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

75
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.989
<v ->Well you know they're being pursued in the same way</v>

76
00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.926
that other things are in terms of reductionism,

77
00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:30.328
trying to look at brain explanations for consciousness.

78
00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:33.198
That'll keep people busy for years yet.

79
00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:35.099
But ultimately I think I think we will come to realize

80
00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.935
that there is more to be explored outside

81
00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:41.340
the boundaries of current science then we realize.

82
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.025
<v Regina>Yeah I think that's kind of the point I was</v>

83
00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.011
getting at I mean even in the world of computer

84
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:47.980
sciences they're already beginning to understand

85
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.581
it's going to interface with consciousness

86
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.919
with the mind sooner or later,

87
00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.321
I mean we're already starting to get there right?

88
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:59.057
That's Michio Kaku's work, that's what they're saying,

89
00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:02.528
that the computing structures of the future will be directly

90
00:04:02.528 --> 00:04:05.830
interfacing with thought and reacting to thought

91
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.299
and carrying out functions according to thought.

92
00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.468
Even in those very hard sciences you still

93
00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:13.147
can't get away from the ultimate outcomes.

94
00:04:13.147 --> 00:04:17.142
I respect the fact that, as you already see this

95
00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:21.046
long term view, you have taken it upon yourself

96
00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:24.348
to use your craft, your scientific knowledge

97
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.420
and your understanding that consciousness exists,

98
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.055
to begin looking at the universe from a very

99
00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:32.758
structural point of view as to how this can exist.

100
00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:35.961
So I'd say from here, well okay astrophysics,

101
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:40.199
how 'bout Edgar Mitchell, I know that you know Edgar.

102
00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.799
<v ->Yes.</v>

103
00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.353
<v Regina>And there seems to be</v>

104
00:04:44.353 --> 00:04:47.772
this experience once one truly taps in

105
00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:51.175
to the nature of the cosmos that almost bring up

106
00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:54.046
a spiritual kind of feeling or inquiry

107
00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:56.547
or understanding such as Edgar's.

108
00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:59.284
Is that part of what you experience in your work?

109
00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:00.985
<v ->Well I can't say I experience anything</v>

110
00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:03.554
as profound Edgar's, on the way back from the Moon

111
00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:06.158
he had this cosmic-consciousness experience

112
00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:10.228
in the little capsule they were returning to Earth in.

113
00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:13.098
It was very profound, it certainly affected his life.

114
00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:16.001
I can't say anything that profound ever happened to me.

115
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.704
So my interest in these things is more from

116
00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:22.574
the intellectual side, the evidence from within science

117
00:05:22.574 --> 00:05:25.245
that the universe is apparently finely tuned.

118
00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:28.146
That makes a big influence, has a big influence on me.

119
00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:31.148
So it's coming, in my case more from

120
00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:33.184
the things that I've learned intellectually,

121
00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:36.254
than from any kind of mystical or cosmic experience.

122
00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Regina>Even though those impulses</v>

123
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.325
are just a natural part of your being.

124
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:42.759
<v ->I guess they are I mean the interest in spirituality</v>

125
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.897
is something that I grew up with, I never left entirely.

126
00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:48.632
I sort of drifted away from that when I left the seminary.

127
00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:50.569
Then came back to it again with a more or less

128
00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.005
independent perspective and that's what caused me

129
00:05:53.005 --> 00:05:54.706
to write these two books of mine.

130
00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:58.344
The Purpose-Guided Universe and The God Theory.

131
00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.479
To present to people the notion that,

132
00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.148
yeah you can be perfectly happy with science

133
00:06:03.148 --> 00:06:05.084
as a way to study the world but not let that be

134
00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:07.436
the totality of your world view, that there are reasons

135
00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:09.203
to expand your world view beyond that

136
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.938
and still stay true to science for example you don't

137
00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.824
have to give up belief in the Big Bang.

138
00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:14.793
The Big Bang is a great way to start a universe.

139
00:06:14.793 --> 00:06:16.595
I think from a meta-physical perspective

140
00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:18.764
it's a wonderful way to start a universe.

141
00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:20.932
And evolution I think is a key aspect

142
00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:23.402
of the whole purpose behind the universe.

143
00:06:23.402 --> 00:06:25.236
And so I think you need to keep these things

144
00:06:25.236 --> 00:06:28.473
as fundamental bases of science and at the same time

145
00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:30.876
of your own world view and that doesn't preclude

146
00:06:30.876 --> 00:06:33.411
believing in spiritual realities.

147
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:35.947
<v Regina>Thank you for that, as a scientist</v>

148
00:06:35.947 --> 00:06:38.683
I appreciate sitting across from you.

149
00:06:38.683 --> 00:06:41.352
Let's talk about where we start getting into

150
00:06:41.352 --> 00:06:44.622
the more controversial aspect of your work.

151
00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:48.360
At some point I do want to talk about

152
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.795
your understanding of the finely-tuned aspect

153
00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:53.431
of the universe because this all goes together now.

154
00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:58.386
You're saying, yes 14 billion years ago or so

155
00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:02.107
there was a Big Bang and however there is something

156
00:07:02.107 --> 00:07:05.777
that guided even that and then what happened ultimately,

157
00:07:05.777 --> 00:07:10.114
to intelligently put the fine tuning in place

158
00:07:10.114 --> 00:07:13.018
for the structure of the universe so,

159
00:07:13.018 --> 00:07:15.386
let's just launch right into your story.

160
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.888
<v ->Well the idea is that the universe is,</v>

161
00:07:17.888 --> 00:07:20.058
well it's not an idea the universe is finely structured

162
00:07:20.058 --> 00:07:22.627
it's a fact, we know that there are at least

163
00:07:22.627 --> 00:07:25.296
10 or a dozen or so different constants,

164
00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:27.266
the laws of nature, that probably could have

165
00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:28.767
been very different for all we know.

166
00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:30.901
If they'd been very different we wouldn't be here to,

167
00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:32.671
we wouldn't be her at all, the universe would

168
00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:34.539
not be full of life, at least our planet Earth would

169
00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.540
not be full of life and probably the universes too.

170
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.443
But anyway, the laws of nature had to be rather

171
00:07:38.443 --> 00:07:40.677
finely tuned to work together to allow life

172
00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:43.714
to rise at least here and then probably elsewhere.

173
00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:45.949
So that's a very important thing to keep in mind.

174
00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:47.887
That's something that needs an explanation.

175
00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:49.521
And if you want to you can explain all this away

176
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:52.991
without any spiritual interpretation at all if you want to.

177
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:54.659
That's what scientists have generally done,

178
00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:57.130
they say well okay we have a finely tuned universe,

179
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.497
this implies there have to be other universes,

180
00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:02.200
maybe even an infinite number of other universes

181
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.235
that are different from ours and so of course

182
00:08:04.235 --> 00:08:05.987
we're in this one because it's the only one we can fit in,

183
00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:08.006
we can originate in, but there have to be lots

184
00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:09.808
of other because we don't want ours to be special.

185
00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:11.443
I mean that would imply a creator

186
00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:13.879
and of course we can't tolerate that.

187
00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.047
<v Regina>Right and so first of all,</v>

188
00:08:16.047 --> 00:08:17.549
what is your definition of God?

189
00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:20.617
You wrote The God Theory, what is your definition of God?

190
00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:23.888
<v ->Well that's a (laugh) good question.</v>

191
00:08:23.888 --> 00:08:27.058
I don't know what God is anymore than anybody else does.

192
00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:30.062
I'm guessing I think that God is probably

193
00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:33.031
some infinite, transcendent consciousness,

194
00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:35.499
some consciousness that is simultaneously

195
00:08:35.499 --> 00:08:38.336
greater than infinite and less than zero.

196
00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:43.060
Some consciousness that desired to know itself

197
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.211
and to know itself it needed to create a space,

198
00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:50.282
a reality in which it could act out and experience things,

199
00:08:50.282 --> 00:08:52.450
which I think is what we're doing right here, right now

200
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.786
talking and what we do as human beings.

201
00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:57.722
I think we are manifestations of God,

202
00:08:57.722 --> 00:08:59.991
seeking physical experience because that's

203
00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:02.292
perhaps a joy to God to experience,

204
00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:05.363
not always a joy to us down here

205
00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:07.865
but also because that may be a way for God to evolve.

206
00:09:07.865 --> 00:09:11.035
Maybe God himself, I say himself.

207
00:09:11.035 --> 00:09:13.072
I mean himself, herself, itself.

208
00:09:13.072 --> 00:09:14.873
I think God perhaps needs to evolve

209
00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:17.308
and can do that only through entering

210
00:09:17.308 --> 00:09:19.242
the space, the space-time stream

211
00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.581
and existing in a physical universe as intelligent beings.

212
00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:25.282
Or even not so intelligent beings such as animals.

213
00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:28.620
I think that's all part of how God may increase

214
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.389
his greatness, increase his perfection

215
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:33.224
if such thing is possible.

216
00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Regina>So if I'm to read into that, we're fractals</v>

217
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.529
of God, the fractals of that consciousness

218
00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:41.700
that you are referring to as God.

219
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.303
This intelligent source that essentially permeates

220
00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:48.940
everything and is trying to, seeking to express itself

221
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.175
and we're expressions of that?

222
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:52.977
<v ->I think that we're saying the same thing.</v>

223
00:09:52.977 --> 00:09:55.146
You use the term fractal which is a very definite,

224
00:09:55.146 --> 00:09:55.746
has a very specific--

225
00:09:55.746 --> 00:09:56.914
<v Regina>Yeah well I'm with the scientists,</v>

226
00:09:56.914 --> 00:09:58.516
maybe I'm using it a little too meta-physically.

227
00:09:58.516 --> 00:09:59.351
<v ->Yeah.</v>

228
00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:00.885
<v Regina>So use it in the proper term,</v>

229
00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:01.619
that you would describe.

230
00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:03.155
<v ->Fractal would be, it's a mathematical term</v>

231
00:10:03.155 --> 00:10:05.522
having to do with dimensionalities and so on.

232
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.458
I think what you're talking about is simply that we are,

233
00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:10.429
say sparks of God, if you imagine God as being

234
00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:13.264
some huge bonfire of consciousness,

235
00:10:13.264 --> 00:10:15.533
we're little sparks of God that adventured into

236
00:10:15.533 --> 00:10:18.570
a space-time stream, a physical universe,

237
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.639
probably in order to give experience

238
00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:22.840
back to God so that God can know himself.

239
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.508
If you're the only being around

240
00:10:24.508 --> 00:10:26.177
and you have infinite potential

241
00:10:26.177 --> 00:10:28.412
that's different than knowing,

242
00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:30.448
that's different than having the experience.

243
00:10:30.448 --> 00:10:32.084
I think even an infinite intelligence

244
00:10:32.084 --> 00:10:35.809
needs to come to know itself and to have experience

245
00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:39.843
in order to fully comprehend himself.

246
00:10:39.843 --> 00:10:41.993
There's a mystery here of course

247
00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:44.062
in which I don't claim to have solved,

248
00:10:44.062 --> 00:10:47.865
but I think there is a purpose that we bring to God

249
00:10:47.865 --> 00:10:49.967
by virtue of the experiences that are possible

250
00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:52.437
in this four-dimensional, space-time world.

251
00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:54.938
<v Regina>So you're looking at a physical manifestation</v>

252
00:10:54.938 --> 00:10:58.677
of something much more infinite and more vast.

253
00:10:58.677 --> 00:11:01.846
That essentially precedes all things, permeates all things.

254
00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:05.282
When you take that down to this individuated level which is

255
00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:10.121
a human being, we seem to be reflecting that same dynamic.

256
00:11:10.121 --> 00:11:14.425
We have this part of ourselves as we all know

257
00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:18.729
the term that we're spiritual beings living a human life.

258
00:11:18.729 --> 00:11:22.567
We seem to have this schism withing ourselves

259
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.968
where the part that's living the human life

260
00:11:24.968 --> 00:11:27.072
seems to have very little understanding of

261
00:11:27.072 --> 00:11:31.008
and access to the infinite aspect of ourselves.

262
00:11:31.008 --> 00:11:33.444
I'm sure you must have looked at this

263
00:11:33.444 --> 00:11:35.479
and contemplated it to an extent.

264
00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:37.516
<v ->I think there's a reason behind this.</v>

265
00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:40.785
We come into life without any knowledge

266
00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:43.320
of who we really are or if I'm gonna put it this way,

267
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.323
what other lives we may have lived before.

268
00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:48.025
We come into each life fresh and why is that?

269
00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:50.894
Why are we forbidden to know who we really are

270
00:11:50.894 --> 00:11:53.215
and where we really came from and I think the reason

271
00:11:53.215 --> 00:11:55.432
is because that's the only way to play the game.

272
00:11:55.432 --> 00:11:57.935
If you knew full well who you were

273
00:11:57.935 --> 00:11:59.637
or what you've done in the past,

274
00:11:59.637 --> 00:12:01.506
you wouldn't be able to live a free life.

275
00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:03.774
You wouldn't be able to use your freewill

276
00:12:03.774 --> 00:12:07.912
to either choose to evolve or to un-evolve yourself

277
00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:10.449
as a spiritual being and the implication,

278
00:12:10.449 --> 00:12:12.684
God is the ultimate source of everything.

279
00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:14.652
If you knew it all, you couldn't honestly

280
00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:17.455
create a new and novel existence

281
00:12:17.455 --> 00:12:18.889
and I think that's the point of it,

282
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:20.324
to have a new and novel existence

283
00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:22.260
be possible to see what you do with it.

284
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.095
Then to have that actually work out,

285
00:12:24.095 --> 00:12:26.197
you have to not know what you're doing.

286
00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:27.965
Otherwise the game is spoiled.

287
00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:31.001
<v Regina>But it'd also be if in lives prior to this</v>

288
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.070
for example, if there's been extreme trauma

289
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.306
or we've done things we may not feel too good about,

290
00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:37.942
it might also put a repressive effect and judgement

291
00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:40.377
on ourselves before we even start the game.

292
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:43.449
<v ->It would indeed in fact if you've lived, say you've been</v>

293
00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:46.478
some evil person in a past life and you have a chance

294
00:12:46.478 --> 00:12:48.703
now to show that you've learned something

295
00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:51.105
from that experience and you can do better,

296
00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:52.857
well you'd have to come into this life without knowing that

297
00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:55.626
otherwise that burden, that knowledge would keep you from

298
00:12:55.626 --> 00:12:59.794
actually being able to change yourself in a positive way.

299
00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:03.734
Now I'm not saying that if bad things happen

300
00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:05.570
to good people, that implies that they've got some

301
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.838
karma to make up, I mean sometimes you can

302
00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:09.874
choose I suppose, a life that is difficult,

303
00:13:09.874 --> 00:13:11.876
that has hardships for its own merits

304
00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:13.911
because that's a way to evolve yourself.

305
00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:16.548
So we have to be careful with the application of the laws

306
00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:19.666
of karma but I think the laws of karma are at play here.

307
00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:22.553
<v Regina>Absolutely does there come a time</v>

308
00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:26.557
in a species history where we can evolve our own

309
00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.160
consciousness and understanding of self

310
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.563
and acceptance of self to the extent where this

311
00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:36.867
unification between our finer spirit, soul aspect

312
00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:38.902
and the physical dimension of ourselves that

313
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:41.272
we're living in, the physical encasement and identity,

314
00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:43.841
can actually successfully begin merging

315
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:47.545
is it possible we're approaching that status now?

316
00:13:47.545 --> 00:13:49.814
<v ->I wish it were, I mean I think it may be possible,</v>

317
00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:51.717
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon

318
00:13:51.717 --> 00:13:54.251
given the state of the human of behavior

319
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.888
on the planet today, I'm kind of skeptical

320
00:13:55.888 --> 00:13:57.688
it's gonna happen anytime soon.

321
00:13:57.688 --> 00:13:59.524
But it would be great if we could enter into physical life,

322
00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:01.960
knowing who we are and knowing we've been blessed

323
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.629
by being allowed to experience this arena here

324
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:08.665
and to fall in love and do all the things

325
00:14:08.665 --> 00:14:12.002
that are pleasant to do without worrying about death

326
00:14:12.002 --> 00:14:14.505
because we know that death is simply returning

327
00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:17.142
to our realm as consciousness beings.

328
00:14:17.142 --> 00:14:19.209
That'd be nice if it were like that but I'm a little bit

329
00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:21.279
skeptical it's gonna happen any time soon.

330
00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.581
<v Regina>And there are people on the planet who</v>

331
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:26.318
are doing this, some of those that were called masters,

332
00:14:26.318 --> 00:14:29.085
the Dalai Lama, the whole lineage of Lamas for example,

333
00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:31.521
and even some of the younger children,

334
00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:33.559
the little ones being born right now, there seems

335
00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:35.992
to be evidence that they're coming in more integrated.

336
00:14:35.992 --> 00:14:38.130
<v ->I'm little surprised that the Dalai Lama's not talked</v>

337
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.864
more about this because I do see him as being

338
00:14:39.864 --> 00:14:41.833
someone who's probably about as enlightened

339
00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:43.768
as you can get on the planet these days or the today.

340
00:14:43.768 --> 00:14:47.690
Yet I don't see him talking about the,

341
00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:52.071
much about the role of karma or about

342
00:14:52.744 --> 00:14:56.213
the whole process of being born and the purpose behind it.

343
00:14:56.213 --> 00:14:57.715
I don't know why, maybe it's something that

344
00:14:57.715 --> 00:15:00.684
he thinks shouldn't be brought to consciousness yet.

345
00:15:00.684 --> 00:15:03.053
But I'm a little disappointed that I have not heard

346
00:15:03.053 --> 00:15:04.956
more along these lines from him, even though I think

347
00:15:04.956 --> 00:15:07.058
he's probably the most enlightened person on the planet.

348
00:15:07.058 --> 00:15:09.227
<v Regina>Interesting, you know this is just speculation,</v>

349
00:15:09.227 --> 00:15:11.128
and that's all on my part, my guess is this,

350
00:15:11.128 --> 00:15:13.730
because he has made it his path to

351
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.435
pass through some of the wisdoms of his lineage

352
00:15:17.435 --> 00:15:20.487
to the western population and we're so programmed

353
00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:23.542
against the notion of continued incarnations,

354
00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:26.611
just to start with, doesn't even have a platform

355
00:15:26.611 --> 00:15:29.246
to work with with the rest, how can you

356
00:15:29.246 --> 00:15:32.116
I mean even his own lineage, I can understand

357
00:15:32.116 --> 00:15:35.519
why he would just give us the western world,

358
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:39.890
little baby steps, little, little nibbles of information

359
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.360
without going into all of that, although I think

360
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.928
it's been already well documented

361
00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:48.566
in terms of their, his lineage and the others before him,

362
00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:51.301
if one cares to dig, but you're right, it's not just

363
00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:53.737
being laid before us and what a beautiful gift

364
00:15:53.737 --> 00:15:55.939
that would be from the Dalai Lama to say,

365
00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:58.644
look this is how I understand the function of the soul.

366
00:15:58.644 --> 00:16:01.478
<v ->Yep, it would be a very-very different world</v>

367
00:16:01.478 --> 00:16:04.181
if we actually had evidence and we truly believed

368
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:08.285
as a species that we're responsible for our actions,

369
00:16:08.285 --> 00:16:11.388
that karma exists, it would certainly be a very

370
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.424
effective way to suppress some of the evil

371
00:16:14.424 --> 00:16:16.161
because if you know it's gonna come back to you,

372
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:19.497
well unless you're really-really deranged and perverted,

373
00:16:19.497 --> 00:16:21.449
you're probably not going to do something really evil

374
00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:22.968
because you're gonna have experience yourself later.

375
00:16:22.968 --> 00:16:25.002
If you truly believe that's how it works then

376
00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:27.238
that would be a big deterrent.

377
00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:29.974
<v Regina>We're on the same page (laugh) my friend,</v>

378
00:16:29.974 --> 00:16:32.176
I couldn't agree with you more on that.

379
00:16:32.176 --> 00:16:35.647
When we're looking now, let's start taking

380
00:16:35.647 --> 00:16:38.198
this overlay into,

381
00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:43.805
more of the tenets that you have in your book.

382
00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:46.225
We understand where we're coming from on

383
00:16:46.225 --> 00:16:48.827
kind of an intimate level of understanding of soul

384
00:16:48.827 --> 00:16:51.696
and the human but now going back to the world of science

385
00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:55.700
where we were originally talking about to bring in Darwin,

386
00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.003
to bring in Einstein, to bring in God and put all this

387
00:17:00.003 --> 00:17:03.674
together and say each one is playing a very necessary part

388
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:06.811
in the evolution, well I don't mean theory of evolution,

389
00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:09.214
but the evolution of consciousness on this planet.

390
00:17:09.214 --> 00:17:11.114
How do you weave these all together?

391
00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:13.152
How do you make that claim?

392
00:17:13.152 --> 00:17:16.754
<v ->Well I think that first of all we have to accept some</v>

393
00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:19.289
of the fundamental discoveries of science as being valid.

394
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.192
I'm not gonna argue with the Big Bang, as I said before

395
00:17:21.192 --> 00:17:23.126
I think even from a meta-physical perspective,

396
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.396
it's a great way to start a universe.

397
00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:27.130
If I were God I think I would start the universe with

398
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.267
a big bang myself, it's a great way to start a universe.

399
00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:32.604
In terms of evolution I think that's an essential part

400
00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:36.497
of the if I can put it this way, God's plan.

401
00:17:36.497 --> 00:17:39.450
Because without evolution you would have everything

402
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.649
either being totally chaotic

403
00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:46.885
or you would have something that relies on the creator

404
00:17:46.885 --> 00:17:49.554
to sort of tinker around with the world

405
00:17:49.554 --> 00:17:51.855
and make things this way and that way and so on.

406
00:17:51.855 --> 00:17:54.892
That's not really I think what God seeks.

407
00:17:54.892 --> 00:17:57.795
I think what God seeks is a novel, new experience

408
00:17:57.795 --> 00:18:00.465
to kind of put his, put his some of his powers

409
00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:02.900
and abilities to work within an arena

410
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.902
and the arena in this case being our universe

411
00:18:04.902 --> 00:18:07.272
and then letting it go and seeing what happens,

412
00:18:07.272 --> 00:18:11.891
seeing what his own potential, what his own laws

413
00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:15.112
and what his own abilities can result in.

414
00:18:15.112 --> 00:18:18.615
If left to do it themselves but if he had to do it himself

415
00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:22.218
and by micro-engineering things, that would probably

416
00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:24.321
defeat the whole purpose of it.

417
00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:26.524
It's the difference between living a life

418
00:18:26.524 --> 00:18:28.559
and being an actor on a stage where you're all you're

419
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.928
doing is reading the dialogue over and over and over again.

420
00:18:30.928 --> 00:18:33.064
<v Regina>Mm-hmm and where does the whole</v>

421
00:18:33.064 --> 00:18:35.933
notion of quantum mechanics fit into this creation?

422
00:18:35.933 --> 00:18:39.971
<v ->Well quantum mechanics is I think what we're going</v>

423
00:18:39.971 --> 00:18:43.106
to learn at the basis of reality is consciousness.

424
00:18:43.106 --> 00:18:45.043
Because conscious has been at the basis

425
00:18:45.043 --> 00:18:47.845
of quantum mechanics since the get go.

426
00:18:47.845 --> 00:18:50.514
And it's kind of the skeleton in the closet of physics

427
00:18:50.514 --> 00:18:52.817
that it's really consciousness that makes quantum

428
00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:55.120
mechanical measurements possible and

429
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.505
there're all sorts of ways that you can kind of

430
00:18:57.505 --> 00:19:00.424
try to argue around this bit but still

431
00:19:00.424 --> 00:19:02.292
you come back in the end to conscious as being

432
00:19:02.292 --> 00:19:05.363
essential aspect, an essential aspect of quantum mechanics.

433
00:19:05.363 --> 00:19:07.965
I think from quantum mechanics we're going to learn

434
00:19:07.965 --> 00:19:10.334
that ultimately we're gonna have to build a world view

435
00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:13.870
on consciousness rather than upon just matter and energy.

436
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.141
That matter and energy, even though they're valid

437
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:18.709
constituents of the universe, they're not the primary stuff.

438
00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:21.012
They're the stuff that's ultimately made of consciousness.

439
00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:24.249
Now how do you formulate this in a scientific way,

440
00:19:24.249 --> 00:19:27.384
I don't know because science has so been

441
00:19:27.384 --> 00:19:29.987
so much developed in terms of reductionist thinking

442
00:19:29.987 --> 00:19:32.490
and materialist thinking, you have to start almost

443
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.592
from scratch to develop a science that is based on

444
00:19:34.592 --> 00:19:36.477
consciousness but I think we're gonna be forced to do

445
00:19:36.477 --> 00:19:39.329
that because I think that's the nature how it is.

446
00:19:39.329 --> 00:19:42.432
<v Regina>And some of this is being done in some of</v>

447
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:45.369
the experimentation as I mentioned before,

448
00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:49.240
with Dean Radin for example, where he's certainly,

449
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.029
they've begun to understand that

450
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:57.206
a scientific outcome of an experiment is being altered

451
00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:59.533
by the observer.
<v Bernard>Right.</v>

452
00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.286
<v Regina>That's just pure consciousness interfacing</v>

453
00:20:02.286 --> 00:20:04.555
with consciousness right there.

454
00:20:04.555 --> 00:20:07.793
I mean that's pretty, that's big I mean it seems like

455
00:20:07.793 --> 00:20:10.760
they talk about Schrodinger's cat and

456
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.698
other experiments they've done ad nauseam

457
00:20:13.698 --> 00:20:16.432
repeated, repeated, repeated.

458
00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:18.803
But the implications of this are huge.

459
00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.637
<v ->They are but I don't think they're quite</v>

460
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.508
taken to that level by scientists.

461
00:20:22.508 --> 00:20:24.441
At this point you can say consciousness

462
00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:26.460
and then leave open what you mean by consciousness.

463
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.512
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

464
00:20:27.512 --> 00:20:29.046
<v ->Well we don't really know what it is yet</v>

465
00:20:29.046 --> 00:20:30.715
and it's probably still gonna be explainable

466
00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:33.019
in terms of the neurons and brain chemistry and so on.

467
00:20:33.019 --> 00:20:36.170
It kinda has an effect in quantum mechanics but

468
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:39.723
to make the leap from that to consciousness

469
00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:41.726
is the fundamental stuff of reality,

470
00:20:41.726 --> 00:20:43.660
that, that's a big leap for scientists to make.

471
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.029
<v Regina>It is a big leap but this is,</v>

472
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:47.330
I think this is a really nice little connecting point.

473
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.900
If they're saying, simply by observing

474
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.271
an experiment, that that observation, even if you don't have

475
00:20:54.271 --> 00:20:57.641
a defined point of view as what you want the outcome

476
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:00.998
to be just the observation itself will affect

477
00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:04.180
where a wave or particle goes or what it becomes.

478
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.984
<v ->It does yeah.</v>

479
00:21:05.984 --> 00:21:07.918
<v Regina>That's a really, I think that's</v>

480
00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:10.022
a really significant beginning point to

481
00:21:10.022 --> 00:21:11.754
be able to open that dialogue.

482
00:21:11.754 --> 00:21:13.574
<v ->It does, it does raise a dialogue to the extent</v>

483
00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:14.992
that consciousness is now part of the game

484
00:21:14.992 --> 00:21:16.876
but that still leaves open the question,

485
00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:18.695
what is consciousness and you still then have

486
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.430
the desire on the part of mainstream science

487
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.233
to say well we will understand it eventually.

488
00:21:22.233 --> 00:21:24.871
Somehow it rises up in the brain,

489
00:21:24.871 --> 00:21:26.736
and as we do more brain studies we'll know

490
00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:29.040
where it comes from and don't worry too much

491
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.007
about the meta-physical aspects of this

492
00:21:31.007 --> 00:21:33.845
cus we'll eventually bring it into the house of science.

493
00:21:33.845 --> 00:21:35.679
I think that's not gonna happen.

494
00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.065
I think that the house of science is gonna have to expand

495
00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:40.650
to include consciousness at the top-most level,

496
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.786
as a source of everything.

497
00:21:42.786 --> 00:21:45.326
<v Regina>Absolutely, do you, have you, would you attempt</v>

498
00:21:45.326 --> 00:21:49.266
to define consciousness yourself at this point?

499
00:21:49.276 --> 00:21:52.029
<v ->You know I think consciousness is a kind of thing</v>

500
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:54.632
that you can't define, what you can do is say,

501
00:21:54.632 --> 00:21:57.705
well I know of what conscious is because I am conscious.

502
00:21:57.705 --> 00:22:01.238
I am conscious, it's the most primary, most fundamental

503
00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:03.339
thing that I know, I guess I'd rather give up

504
00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:05.375
believing that one plus one equals two,

505
00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:08.329
than my own consciousness cus I know I'm conscious.

506
00:22:08.329 --> 00:22:10.948
Everybody knows that but you can kind of

507
00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:13.883
argue yourself into a corner, well it's really something

508
00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:17.387
that's you know an epiphenomenon in the brain

509
00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:20.758
and it's something that we'll understand eventually,

510
00:22:20.758 --> 00:22:24.695
but I think that just the fact of our own experience

511
00:22:24.695 --> 00:22:26.963
of consciousness is the best proof there is.

512
00:22:26.963 --> 00:22:28.866
We gotta know we're conscious even those

513
00:22:28.866 --> 00:22:30.903
who deny it know they're conscious.

514
00:22:30.903 --> 00:22:32.236
<v Regina>I interviewed Raymond Moody,</v>

515
00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:34.371
Doctor Raymond Moody about the subject

516
00:22:34.371 --> 00:22:36.240
of near-death experiences and he is a very

517
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.316
rational person, very much steeped in

518
00:22:41.562 --> 00:22:45.317
the platonic world of science and yet at the same time

519
00:22:45.317 --> 00:22:47.450
he cannot deny there is something that's

520
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.071
transcending any kind of chemical processes in the brain.

521
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:54.058
Any kind of physicality, I think you mentioned near-death

522
00:22:54.058 --> 00:22:56.159
experience in some of your work too.

523
00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:58.415
<v ->That's right there's I think very strong evidence for</v>

524
00:22:58.415 --> 00:23:00.965
near-death experiences and from transcendent experiences.

525
00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:03.502
People throughout the ages, throughout the ages,

526
00:23:03.502 --> 00:23:05.336
the mystics throughout the ages have reported

527
00:23:05.336 --> 00:23:07.973
that there's a reality that they tune into that is

528
00:23:07.973 --> 00:23:10.708
a reality that's more real than ordinary reality.

529
00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:13.276
You can say well that's purely anecdotal

530
00:23:13.276 --> 00:23:16.547
but I think there's more to it than that.

531
00:23:16.547 --> 00:23:19.517
I think that, that constitutes evidence and it's

532
00:23:19.517 --> 00:23:21.785
consciousness that it is the basis of things.

533
00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:24.088
<v Regina>You know that the same time the consciousness</v>

534
00:23:24.088 --> 00:23:26.089
that we're speaking of just as we spoke about

535
00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:29.696
a little bit ago with some of Dean Radin's experiments,

536
00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:34.933
very much is interfacing with mind.

537
00:23:34.933 --> 00:23:38.869
Smaller-mind, consciousness-mind and greater-mind.

538
00:23:38.869 --> 00:23:42.438
The mind in consciousness, where those two meet,

539
00:23:42.438 --> 00:23:45.910
where those fields meet, for lack of a better word,

540
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.513
I'm not a scientist so I'm not, I don't have

541
00:23:48.513 --> 00:23:52.150
the vernacular to put it in but,

542
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.719
where mind and consciousness meet,

543
00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.755
really is where all creation occurs.

544
00:23:57.755 --> 00:23:59.757
Because it's directed.

545
00:23:59.757 --> 00:24:01.759
<v ->I guess I don't know at this point</v>

546
00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:04.344
how I would differentiate mind from consciousness.

547
00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:06.229
They're both mysterious aspects I mean

548
00:24:06.229 --> 00:24:08.699
brain I know, it's the stuff up there in my head

549
00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:11.968
but mind and consciousness, maybe one in the same thing.

550
00:24:11.968 --> 00:24:15.639
<v Regina>Yes and that's how in my own internal-scape</v>

551
00:24:15.639 --> 00:24:18.642
I see the larger mind as the same as consciousness

552
00:24:18.642 --> 00:24:20.810
but then there is also the conscious-animal portion

553
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.349
of the mind that has familiar experiences of the conscious

554
00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:27.851
world we're bumping around in day to day and also

555
00:24:27.851 --> 00:24:32.322
desires that may be driven by spirit or the soul.

556
00:24:32.322 --> 00:24:35.894
That are projected through a mental desire,

557
00:24:35.894 --> 00:24:39.630
or even a mental will on our part to spin

558
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.298
the creative process into motion.

559
00:24:42.298 --> 00:24:45.302
So it seems like there's this interface that really

560
00:24:45.302 --> 00:24:50.088
is the basis for the world we see around us,

561
00:24:50.748 --> 00:24:54.445
this conscious creation of ours, as limited as it may be.

562
00:24:54.445 --> 00:24:57.363
Is that an area that we really need to start looking at?

563
00:24:57.363 --> 00:25:00.417
To start creating much more infinite types

564
00:25:00.417 --> 00:25:03.488
of realities, types of experiences for ourselves.

565
00:25:03.488 --> 00:25:06.223
<v ->Well I think we need to look at the conscious experiments</v>

566
00:25:06.223 --> 00:25:10.803
that go beyond the neurophysiology limitations.

567
00:25:10.803 --> 00:25:13.581
Things that for example the people working in

568
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:15.949
para-psychology have done over the years and

569
00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:17.836
that's still a field that's in limbo as far as mainstream

570
00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:20.571
science is concerned but there's a huge amount of evidence

571
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:22.906
that para-psychological phenomena exist.

572
00:25:22.906 --> 00:25:25.008
I think they are probably the direct,

573
00:25:25.008 --> 00:25:28.470
will turn out to be the direct evidence of consciousness

574
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.949
playing a role in reality, I think that they will provide

575
00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:35.886
the seminal data once it's been, once they are recognized

576
00:25:35.886 --> 00:25:39.858
as being valid studies and in fact a valid discipline

577
00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:42.492
and it's still sort of on the borderline still

578
00:25:42.492 --> 00:25:46.530
but I think that it's future will grow dramatically.

579
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.632
<v Regina>Is that Doctor Charles Tart,</v>

580
00:25:48.632 --> 00:25:50.617
some of his work and others like him.

581
00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:52.336
<v ->Well he among many others and Russel Targ,</v>

582
00:25:52.336 --> 00:25:54.103
Hal Puthoff...
<v Regina>and Russel Targ.</v>

583
00:25:54.103 --> 00:25:56.340
Yes I mean obviously they've produced,

584
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.009
they've certainly produced in the trenches results.

585
00:25:59.009 --> 00:26:01.211
I just suppose science is still trying to explain

586
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:03.080
why this occurs the way it does.

587
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.847
<v ->There's also the Princeton experiments with</v>

588
00:26:04.847 --> 00:26:08.251
Robert Jahn, Brenda Dunne and York Dobyns and those people.

589
00:26:08.251 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Regina>Go 'head and explain those.</v>

590
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.423
<v ->Oh well they studied for years and years</v>

591
00:26:12.423 --> 00:26:15.124
the ability of the mind to affect random numbers

592
00:26:15.124 --> 00:26:18.196
and they found the effect was really-really tiny

593
00:26:18.196 --> 00:26:20.330
but really-really robust and by that

594
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.365
I mean that the effect of the mind on

595
00:26:22.365 --> 00:26:24.501
like the outcome of say dice rolls,

596
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:27.404
the rolling of dice or just electronic dice or real dice,

597
00:26:27.404 --> 00:26:30.141
is a tiny effect but it's becoming significant

598
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:32.810
at the level of one in a billion or more.

599
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.822
In terms of its probability of being just an accident.

600
00:26:36.822 --> 00:26:39.115
So while the effect is small it's something

601
00:26:39.115 --> 00:26:41.751
that's been repeatable many times and that

602
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:44.154
constitutes pretty good evidence in my opinion

603
00:26:44.154 --> 00:26:47.525
that there is an effect of consciousness on matter.

604
00:26:47.525 --> 00:26:49.809
<v Regina>Absolutely and then where non-matter</v>

605
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:51.995
is concerned, some have even, the early experiments,

606
00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:54.165
I was talking to you off camera about this as well.

607
00:26:54.165 --> 00:26:58.251
I originally met Russel Targ about 26 years ago,

608
00:26:58.251 --> 00:27:00.355
interviewing him when he had just gotten back

609
00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:02.206
from Russia where they were doing the joint US,

610
00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:04.408
Soviet experiments on remote viewing

611
00:27:04.408 --> 00:27:08.345
and the kicker to that story was that

612
00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:12.917
the target, the woman Juna was viewing into the future.

613
00:27:12.917 --> 00:27:16.333
She didn't know that at the time and

614
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.022
this starts bringing up the whole notion of mind.

615
00:27:19.022 --> 00:27:21.290
What is time, what is space, how does mind

616
00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.327
interface with the consciousness that moves

617
00:27:24.327 --> 00:27:26.896
beyond time and space, is it all one and the same?

618
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:29.699
Seeing it from a really simple point of view

619
00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:32.035
as just a human being who is using their own mind

620
00:27:32.035 --> 00:27:34.737
and consciousness, it looks really easy.

621
00:27:34.737 --> 00:27:39.510
If we are a part of that consciousness that is God,

622
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.013
we have that infinite part of us that moves beyond time and

623
00:27:43.013 --> 00:27:46.484
space and that are immensely capable as creators ourself,

624
00:27:46.484 --> 00:27:49.051
I don't see any real conflict with any of it

625
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:51.289
but again how do you prove it.

626
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:53.986
<v ->Right, well I guess you prove it by</v>

627
00:27:53.986 --> 00:27:57.250
experiments in the laboratory but even that is not

628
00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.030
good enough for mainstream science yet.

629
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:04.000
Certainly the, if we are manifestations of

630
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.070
a universal consciousness that would explain

631
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.271
our ability to from time to time, do things that simply

632
00:28:08.271 --> 00:28:12.535
are not possible within the ordinary space-time paradigm.

633
00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:17.580
These things do happen and I think that

634
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.984
where the evidence is going to come from that

635
00:28:19.984 --> 00:28:22.052
gives us a brighter perspective of the nature

636
00:28:22.052 --> 00:28:25.656
of the human being what we are, are we simply physical

637
00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:29.560
entities made of chemistry and matter or are we

638
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.330
spiritual beings that use these bodies to gain experience?

639
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.799
<v Regina>And there's some really cool experiments</v>

640
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.035
that actually are going on that everyday people can

641
00:28:38.035 --> 00:28:40.970
participate in and one of the people I interviewed recently

642
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.274
said, "we really need to have more science on this,"

643
00:28:43.274 --> 00:28:45.675
not less science but get science involved

644
00:28:45.675 --> 00:28:48.264
in a new way on it so that it can be

645
00:28:48.264 --> 00:28:50.514
reflected throughout the community

646
00:28:50.514 --> 00:28:53.882
not just in a few highly-funded laboratories.

647
00:28:55.101 --> 00:28:57.520
That made perfect sense to me and even in the room,

648
00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.790
we're sitting in the room and they had

649
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.624
everyone in the room who was attending

650
00:29:01.624 --> 00:29:03.761
this conference do a little experiment.

651
00:29:03.761 --> 00:29:05.863
Look at the screen on there and an image

652
00:29:05.863 --> 00:29:08.264
is going to appear on the screen in a box,

653
00:29:08.264 --> 00:29:10.666
on either the right side or left side, before the image

654
00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:14.087
appears right down left or right and so as soon as

655
00:29:14.087 --> 00:29:16.541
the image appeared, okay get ready, write down

656
00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:19.543
left or right and it was amazing how accurate,

657
00:29:19.543 --> 00:29:21.912
I mean more than half of the audience was able

658
00:29:21.912 --> 00:29:24.714
to accurately guess which side of the screen

659
00:29:24.714 --> 00:29:27.084
the image was going to appear on.

660
00:29:27.084 --> 00:29:30.753
This seems to me to be perfectly valid science,

661
00:29:30.753 --> 00:29:33.089
but he said this hasn't been documented,

662
00:29:33.089 --> 00:29:35.459
this hasn't been funded, no one is going to know

663
00:29:35.459 --> 00:29:37.261
about what's been done here today.

664
00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:39.129
Yet it is perfectly valid science.

665
00:29:39.129 --> 00:29:41.265
How would you get the massive,

666
00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:44.535
the world of science to begin creating

667
00:29:44.535 --> 00:29:48.086
these kinds of experiments that mean something to people?

668
00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:51.943
<v ->Well that's a good question, I tried this myself.</v>

669
00:29:51.943 --> 00:29:54.977
For many years I was editor of a journal,

670
00:29:54.977 --> 00:29:57.179
called the Journal of Scientific Exploration

671
00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:59.416
and we were the only journal that had

672
00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:02.387
a scholarly kind of format, peer reviewing

673
00:30:02.387 --> 00:30:05.571
of the articles that are submitted,

674
00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:08.090
and see them open to subjects that

675
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.327
are not possible in mainstream science

676
00:30:10.327 --> 00:30:12.362
and of course the ESP area was one

677
00:30:12.362 --> 00:30:14.898
that we got lots of papers in and so we sorted

678
00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:16.967
through those and decided which ones

679
00:30:16.967 --> 00:30:19.838
had the right kind of scientific credentials

680
00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:21.771
or that kind of scientific methodology appllied

681
00:30:21.771 --> 00:30:24.375
to the experiments that were reported

682
00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:27.511
and so we published them in the hope that by getting things

683
00:30:27.511 --> 00:30:31.048
out there that have the scientific method as their basis,

684
00:30:31.048 --> 00:30:35.218
and even the odd results that we got from the perspective

685
00:30:35.218 --> 00:30:38.054
of mainstream science, would be looked at seriously.

686
00:30:38.054 --> 00:30:40.857
But pretty much science has managed to ignore these things.

687
00:30:40.857 --> 00:30:43.560
We have the journal, the data are out there.

688
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.465
They're increasingly becoming available.

689
00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:49.767
At this point it hasn't made the breakthrough yet.

690
00:30:49.767 --> 00:30:51.902
It's still something that's sort of sitting outside

691
00:30:51.902 --> 00:30:54.305
the doorstep waiting to be let in (laugh).

692
00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:58.843
<v Regina>Is it really more up to us as the consumer</v>

693
00:30:58.843 --> 00:31:03.580
so to speak, as the observers to demand this

694
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.384
or to participate or to look beyond science now?

695
00:31:07.384 --> 00:31:10.052
Because they're not answering a lot of the questions

696
00:31:10.052 --> 00:31:13.123
people want answered anymore, we're not finding it there.

697
00:31:13.123 --> 00:31:14.991
In this realm in particular.

698
00:31:14.991 --> 00:31:17.194
<v ->Well there is a tension between what the public wants.</v>

699
00:31:17.194 --> 00:31:19.963
What the public thinks should be looked at by science

700
00:31:19.963 --> 00:31:22.065
and what scientists think is valid.

701
00:31:22.065 --> 00:31:23.533
Of course people are tax payers,

702
00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:25.836
so they have the right to expect that science would

703
00:31:25.836 --> 00:31:28.504
respond to problems that the public wants investigated.

704
00:31:28.504 --> 00:31:31.608
But at this point there doesn't seem to be any good method

705
00:31:31.608 --> 00:31:35.145
for putting pressure on science to go beyond its boundaries.

706
00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:37.180
And science is having a pretty successful run.

707
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.981
It has had for the last 100 years.

708
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:41.552
It's still basking in its success and going,

709
00:31:41.552 --> 00:31:43.754
well why should we spend our time,

710
00:31:43.754 --> 00:31:45.355
our valuable time and resources,

711
00:31:45.355 --> 00:31:47.924
looking at things that are not liable to be fruitful.

712
00:31:47.924 --> 00:31:50.360
So I don't yet how this, well I guess I do think,

713
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.097
it'll eventually come to the point where science

714
00:31:53.097 --> 00:31:55.981
will have to recognize the validity of things that

715
00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:58.635
are outside of its realm now but I'm kinda skeptical

716
00:31:58.635 --> 00:32:01.237
about the timescale being any time soon.

717
00:32:01.237 --> 00:32:03.456
<v Regina>I can understand your concern about</v>

718
00:32:03.456 --> 00:32:05.231
those timelines because we don't seem

719
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:07.677
to be seeing a lot of evidence but I think this is also

720
00:32:07.677 --> 00:32:10.462
being reinforced by pop-culture whether it's because of fear

721
00:32:10.462 --> 00:32:14.186
of credibility, giggle factors, or out and out conspiracy,

722
00:32:14.186 --> 00:32:16.253
I don't know, I don't care to venture

723
00:32:16.253 --> 00:32:20.091
but the media itself,

724
00:32:20.091 --> 00:32:22.892
is completely skewed toward

725
00:32:22.892 --> 00:32:27.146
the body of science and not what we're speaking about.

726
00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:29.616
In fact there's a ridicule factor around it.

727
00:32:29.616 --> 00:32:31.367
<v ->Yes that's right.</v>

728
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:34.404
<v Regina>So (clears throat) excuse me.</v>

729
00:32:34.914 --> 00:32:38.875
So it appears to me that science may be reflecting,

730
00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:42.245
in that sense it may be reflecting, what they think

731
00:32:42.245 --> 00:32:45.080
is the cultural desire and that's being driven

732
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.006
by other forces beyond our understanding whether

733
00:32:48.006 --> 00:32:51.348
it's Wall Street or whether it's Madison Avenue.

734
00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:55.616
This notion that we cannot open up to consciousness

735
00:32:55.616 --> 00:32:59.674
without getting it muddled with religion

736
00:32:59.674 --> 00:33:04.370
is it keeps everyone running for cover around the subject.

737
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.587
<v ->Well I think that's true but I don't think,</v>

738
00:33:07.587 --> 00:33:09.756
I'm just guessing. I don't think that's the primary

739
00:33:09.756 --> 00:33:12.568
motivation for the, sort of the desire to keep,

740
00:33:12.568 --> 00:33:15.746
to keep these things at arms length.

741
00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:18.117
I think what happens is that scientists

742
00:33:18.117 --> 00:33:20.683
are very busy and they have their areas of expertise

743
00:33:20.683 --> 00:33:23.853
and their successful at them and the world manifests

744
00:33:23.853 --> 00:33:25.922
all the discoveries of science beautifully.

745
00:33:25.922 --> 00:33:28.357
Again as I said earlier, the car you drive, the computer

746
00:33:28.357 --> 00:33:30.493
you operate, these are all products of science.

747
00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:32.397
<v Bernard>Who can deny them?</v>
<v ->That we're grateful for.</v>

748
00:33:32.397 --> 00:33:34.097
<v ->We're grateful for them and they demonstrate</v>

749
00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:36.433
that science is correct as far as it goes.

750
00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:39.035
The point is, where is that as far as it goes?

751
00:33:39.035 --> 00:33:42.039
If you work within the body of scientific knowledge,

752
00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:44.540
indeed it self-reinforces and there's

753
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.311
ample evidence that it works.

754
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:49.225
But the question is what lies beyond?

755
00:33:49.225 --> 00:33:51.847
What kind of pressure is going to be put on science

756
00:33:51.847 --> 00:33:54.418
to look more seriously without laughing or giggling,

757
00:33:54.418 --> 00:33:56.719
at the what's beyond and that's something

758
00:33:56.719 --> 00:33:59.156
I think that still needs to be worked out.

759
00:33:59.156 --> 00:34:02.125
It still needs to be sorted out.

760
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:04.494
<v Regina>Yeah because the materialistic lens</v>

761
00:34:04.494 --> 00:34:07.666
is it seems to me to be coming to

762
00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:10.135
a breaking point In viewing that as

763
00:34:10.135 --> 00:34:13.138
the beginning and end of reality as we know it.

764
00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:15.972
<v ->Well there hasn't been any real strong</v>

765
00:34:15.972 --> 00:34:19.142
thing that we can't explain, that needs explanation,

766
00:34:19.142 --> 00:34:21.878
that requires us to move beyond the scientific paradigm.

767
00:34:21.878 --> 00:34:25.448
So we haven't found the perplexing problem

768
00:34:25.448 --> 00:34:27.950
that really needs a solution that will take us

769
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.887
beyond the ordinary, conventional way of looking at things.

770
00:34:30.887 --> 00:34:32.889
I haven't seen that on the horizon yet.

771
00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.832
<v Regina>And yet as seen in your book, John von Neumann,</v>

772
00:34:36.832 --> 00:34:40.979
1932 he theorized that the field of quantum mechanics,

773
00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:44.100
he was a mathematician right, requires consciousness

774
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.403
to even get a measurable result.

775
00:34:46.403 --> 00:34:48.087
1932?
<v Bernard>That's right.</v>

776
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:50.491
<v Regina>That was a long time ago, this was known already.</v>

777
00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:52.475
<v ->It was known, in fact it's built into quantum mechanics.</v>

778
00:34:52.475 --> 00:34:54.344
That the consciousness needs to be part of

779
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:57.611
the measurement process but again that leaves open

780
00:34:57.611 --> 00:34:59.683
the question, what is consciousness?

781
00:34:59.683 --> 00:35:01.852
You can say well we need consciousness to make

782
00:35:01.852 --> 00:35:03.986
a quantum measurement but we don't really know what it is

783
00:35:03.986 --> 00:35:06.456
and maybe we'll discover that it really does come from

784
00:35:06.456 --> 00:35:08.691
the brain somehow and we'll put this question aside because

785
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:10.827
we don't know what to do with it right now.

786
00:35:10.827 --> 00:35:12.495
So it doesn't necessarily take us to that level where

787
00:35:12.495 --> 00:35:14.664
we say that it's consciousness that really is the primary

788
00:35:14.664 --> 00:35:16.970
stuff of reality and that's what we're gonna look at.

789
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.335
There's still this gap here where there's not enough

790
00:35:19.335 --> 00:35:23.121
pressure that pops open or pops through that gap

791
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.042
to this other kind of way of looking at things.

792
00:35:25.042 --> 00:35:26.810
<v Regina>So that's gonna come from us,</v>

793
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.345
we need to create the pressure.

794
00:35:28.345 --> 00:35:31.277
We need to have, we need to demand to understand

795
00:35:31.277 --> 00:35:35.024
reality on a deeper level as a populace.

796
00:35:35.024 --> 00:35:37.219
They're not going to respond if we don't demand it right?

797
00:35:37.219 --> 00:35:39.523
<v ->Well I guess that's right but there's also a danger</v>

798
00:35:39.523 --> 00:35:42.124
in that in that when people start to say well

799
00:35:42.124 --> 00:35:44.344
there are all these things that science is not looking at.

800
00:35:44.344 --> 00:35:46.163
Boy do you open the door to all sorts of crazy things.

801
00:35:46.163 --> 00:35:47.464
<v Regina>(hearty laughs)</v>

802
00:35:47.464 --> 00:35:50.234
<v ->That's really a put off for scientists.</v>

803
00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.469
Especially now that it's come year 2012

804
00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:54.837
and hear so much nonsense and talk about 2012

805
00:35:54.837 --> 00:35:56.706
that it's really quick to probably set back

806
00:35:56.706 --> 00:35:58.842
the relationship between science and the public

807
00:35:58.842 --> 00:36:01.278
by I don't know say a couple years (laugh).

808
00:36:01.278 --> 00:36:03.280
<v Regina>Well I think it'll create greater polarization</v>

809
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.548
no doubt about it and then where's religion

810
00:36:05.548 --> 00:36:08.574
come in to all of this, organized religion?

811
00:36:08.574 --> 00:36:11.255
<v ->Well organized religion, as I said in my book,</v>

812
00:36:11.255 --> 00:36:13.356
I think there's a big difference to be drawn,

813
00:36:13.356 --> 00:36:15.091
big distinction to be drawn between

814
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:17.127
organized religion and spirituality.

815
00:36:17.127 --> 00:36:20.330
Organized religion has major problems and always has had.

816
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.665
Look at all the violence and the hatred

817
00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:26.652
and the intolerance that comes out of organized religions,

818
00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:29.405
or the wealth that's accumulated by so many

819
00:36:29.405 --> 00:36:31.957
organizations within organized religions.

820
00:36:31.957 --> 00:36:35.077
The fact that religions contradict each other,

821
00:36:35.077 --> 00:36:38.247
so I think that ultimately in the future

822
00:36:38.247 --> 00:36:40.717
religions may be a thing of the past

823
00:36:40.717 --> 00:36:42.451
and that would not be a bad thing,

824
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:45.421
but I think spirituality as our, as what we,

825
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:47.790
the study of what we are as human beings,

826
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.460
spiritual beings, that's not going to go away

827
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.961
because I think that's built in to reality,

828
00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:56.639
but religions themselves they are a mixed blessing.

829
00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:58.584
<v Regina>It's more really, the what you were</v>

830
00:36:58.584 --> 00:37:00.937
just describing in terms of the

831
00:37:00.937 --> 00:37:04.135
effects which have to do with the building of wealth

832
00:37:04.135 --> 00:37:06.809
and violence and intolerance and separation,

833
00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:09.112
is really more like the business

834
00:37:09.112 --> 00:37:12.047
of the corporate world in politics.

835
00:37:12.047 --> 00:37:14.251
<v ->It is it's a lot of corporate world in politics</v>

836
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:16.352
on the spiritual side and not the spiritual side,

837
00:37:16.352 --> 00:37:19.288
the religious side of things and that's unfortunate

838
00:37:19.288 --> 00:37:21.290
because religions really ought to be,

839
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:23.659
they ought to be uplifting and enlightening organizations.

840
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:26.231
Bring out the best in us and in fact often times

841
00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:28.754
they bring out the worst in people.

842
00:37:28.754 --> 00:37:31.333
You find all sorts of crazy things

843
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:33.369
done in the name of religion.

844
00:37:33.369 --> 00:37:35.771
Religion's supposed to be something that promotes peace.

845
00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:37.673
Yet look at all the wars and battles that've been fought

846
00:37:37.673 --> 00:37:40.008
by religions even today in the middle east,

847
00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:43.780
you've got in the two sects of Islam, fighting each other.

848
00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.815
Same religion and yet they hate each other because

849
00:37:45.815 --> 00:37:48.450
they have slightly different interpretations of the lineage

850
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.871
of Muhammad or whatever the basis of the arguments are.

851
00:37:53.489 --> 00:37:57.326
<v Regina>And is it not also possible that science has a,</v>

852
00:37:57.326 --> 00:37:59.945
feels a responsibility

853
00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:02.882
of sorts because of the

854
00:38:03.466 --> 00:38:07.271
fallout from religious fanaticism for example

855
00:38:07.271 --> 00:38:10.873
to maybe hold its cards a little closer to its chest,

856
00:38:10.873 --> 00:38:14.310
not to have their findings confused with the world

857
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.246
of religion as we know it today.

858
00:38:17.246 --> 00:38:20.617
<v ->Well that's indeed true that some of the behavior</v>

859
00:38:20.617 --> 00:38:23.786
of religious, or some organizations, some individuals

860
00:38:23.786 --> 00:38:25.621
is exactly the kind of thing that science is going

861
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:28.156
to react to and go "oh my God," and we better stay

862
00:38:28.156 --> 00:38:30.660
away from this because after all look at what the kind of

863
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.663
craziness results from taking these ideas seriously,

864
00:38:33.663 --> 00:38:36.599
let's just, let's be really, let's circle the wagons

865
00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:39.302
against this kind of nonsense and there is

866
00:38:39.302 --> 00:38:41.270
a circle the wagons mentality, people that,

867
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.306
like Richard Dawkins for example in his book,

868
00:38:43.306 --> 00:38:45.207
certainly would be one of the leaders of

869
00:38:45.207 --> 00:38:47.009
the circle the wagons movement.

870
00:38:47.009 --> 00:38:48.545
<v Regina>Yeah, definitely.</v>

871
00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:50.179
<v ->I can understand that because the craziness</v>

872
00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:51.682
that goes on in the world is certainly,

873
00:38:51.682 --> 00:38:53.782
it's terrible and it should not be something

874
00:38:53.782 --> 00:38:56.374
that comes out of religions and often times does.

875
00:38:56.374 --> 00:38:58.821
There are good reasons to circle the wagons,

876
00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.057
but circling the wagons doesn't mean that there's

877
00:39:01.057 --> 00:39:03.525
this vast territory out there beyond your circling in that

878
00:39:03.525 --> 00:39:06.129
you're gonna have to approach eventually.

879
00:39:06.129 --> 00:39:07.830
<v Regina>And probably the hottest buzz word</v>

880
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.065
in that that would interface with the two

881
00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:13.302
would be the word, the term intelligent design.

882
00:39:13.302 --> 00:39:15.538
<v ->I guess so, I myself stay away from that,</v>

883
00:39:15.538 --> 00:39:17.441
I have to be very careful in my book not to talk about

884
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:19.175
intelligent design, first of all I don't believe

885
00:39:19.175 --> 00:39:22.279
that it happens, I think that evolution is an essential part

886
00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:25.181
of the whole plan behind the universe.

887
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:27.783
I think that the two key discoveries of science

888
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:30.553
that are at the basis I think of my world view

889
00:39:30.553 --> 00:39:33.422
as a scientist who takes spirituality seriously,

890
00:39:33.422 --> 00:39:35.892
is the Big Bang and evolution, both these things

891
00:39:35.892 --> 00:39:38.260
are really necessary to have the kind of universe

892
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.196
that I think that, if I may put it this way,

893
00:39:40.196 --> 00:39:42.766
that God wants to have for his experience.

894
00:39:42.766 --> 00:39:45.901
<v Regina>And yet at the same there is an intelligence</v>

895
00:39:45.901 --> 00:39:47.936
that may have perpetuated that to being with.

896
00:39:47.936 --> 00:39:49.572
<v ->Indeed I think what though happened is that the</v>

897
00:39:49.572 --> 00:39:52.175
intelligence created the laws of nature, the laws of nature

898
00:39:52.175 --> 00:39:54.711
are probably the thoughts of God and then you let

899
00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:57.079
the universe work itself out, you let evolution happen

900
00:39:57.079 --> 00:39:59.115
on the surface of the planets and it can exist in

901
00:39:59.115 --> 00:40:01.951
the universe that has these laws and so it's the designing

902
00:40:01.951 --> 00:40:04.724
of the laws that I think is where the creator enters in.

903
00:40:04.724 --> 00:40:08.123
Then once the laws are set then the things let go

904
00:40:08.123 --> 00:40:11.026
to see what develops, what happens naturally.

905
00:40:11.026 --> 00:40:13.996
The laws of nature being the thoughts of God,

906
00:40:13.996 --> 00:40:15.765
that's something that's compatible with science.

907
00:40:15.765 --> 00:40:19.654
Now science wouldn't prove that of course,

908
00:40:19.654 --> 00:40:21.571
but there's nothing that contradicts science

909
00:40:21.571 --> 00:40:23.239
in that perspective cus we don't know where

910
00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:25.674
the laws came from, no scientist does,

911
00:40:25.674 --> 00:40:28.143
so you may have attributed them to a creator

912
00:40:28.143 --> 00:40:30.513
well that's as valid as anything else.

913
00:40:30.513 --> 00:40:32.882
<v Regina>Very well stated,</v>

914
00:40:32.882 --> 00:40:35.818
we don't have a lot of time left cus I know you have another

915
00:40:35.818 --> 00:40:38.120
appointment in a bit but I just wanted to get into something

916
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.790
with you that I thought was such an interesting perspective,

917
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.526
that I spotted you originally about a year ago

918
00:40:44.526 --> 00:40:46.496
at a remote viewing workshop that was being

919
00:40:46.496 --> 00:40:48.898
conducted by Tom Campbell who we interviewed

920
00:40:48.898 --> 00:40:51.469
that very day, also there was Russel Targ your

921
00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:53.771
lifelong friend or at least of the last 30 years

922
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:56.205
and toward the end of it we actually had to do

923
00:40:56.205 --> 00:40:58.741
a little remote viewing experiments but

924
00:40:58.741 --> 00:41:00.842
along the way he was talking about the power

925
00:41:00.842 --> 00:41:03.245
of the mind and the nature of collective,

926
00:41:03.245 --> 00:41:07.183
individuated and also localized, collective reality

927
00:41:07.183 --> 00:41:11.487
and he was talking about the reality we experience

928
00:41:11.487 --> 00:41:15.023
in our material world being something that was

929
00:41:15.023 --> 00:41:18.694
rendered on a collective basis.

930
00:41:18.694 --> 00:41:21.464
Talk about how you understood that a little bit

931
00:41:21.464 --> 00:41:24.367
if you would before we sign off here, I love that.

932
00:41:24.367 --> 00:41:26.568
<v ->Yeah Tom Campbell's an amazing guy, he's a physicist,</v>

933
00:41:26.568 --> 00:41:29.573
a NASA consultant, a PHD physicist and one who studied

934
00:41:29.573 --> 00:41:33.075
for years and years with Robert Monroe

935
00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:35.644
and he researched some of the topics that were at

936
00:41:35.644 --> 00:41:38.247
the beginning of the Monroe Institute.

937
00:41:38.247 --> 00:41:39.982
He was one of the people that actually

938
00:41:39.982 --> 00:41:41.884
tried to analyze what was going on there.

939
00:41:41.884 --> 00:41:44.920
He became very proficient at creating his own

940
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.823
out-of-body experiences and in these out-of-body experiences

941
00:41:47.823 --> 00:41:50.059
he traveled to many different realms.

942
00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:52.528
Most people would probably not take that seriously,

943
00:41:52.528 --> 00:41:55.898
they'd say well he's imagined this or he dreamed this

944
00:41:55.898 --> 00:41:58.233
or he just made this up maybe.

945
00:41:58.233 --> 00:42:01.103
By having gotten to know him, I think that what

946
00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:03.605
he's reporting is valid information.

947
00:42:03.605 --> 00:42:07.044
He's suggesting that the physical reality

948
00:42:07.044 --> 00:42:09.245
we experience is one of many realities

949
00:42:09.245 --> 00:42:11.413
and that they're all digitally based, it's really

950
00:42:11.413 --> 00:42:14.783
a matter of computing, it's really Sim City.

951
00:42:14.783 --> 00:42:18.833
It's really creating virtual realities

952
00:42:18.833 --> 00:42:21.563
and that we're in this reality right now,

953
00:42:21.563 --> 00:42:23.862
are experiencing a virtual reality,

954
00:42:23.862 --> 00:42:25.895
that our consciousness as spiritual beings,

955
00:42:25.895 --> 00:42:28.964
has collectively fabricated a world made up of these

956
00:42:28.964 --> 00:42:32.807
laws of nature that are not things out there in space-time,

957
00:42:32.807 --> 00:42:36.238
they're algorithms and just like the virtual reality

958
00:42:36.238 --> 00:42:38.240
to your computer can look very realistic,

959
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.562
we're doing that very same thing here.

960
00:42:40.562 --> 00:42:43.412
He's perhaps the first one to,

961
00:42:43.412 --> 00:42:46.650
bring together the view of spirituality with

962
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.419
computer-science and simulation and doing so

963
00:42:50.419 --> 00:42:53.722
not just on the basis of his hypothesizing,

964
00:42:53.722 --> 00:42:55.023
but on the basis of his actually having

965
00:42:55.023 --> 00:42:57.259
experienced some of these realities.

966
00:42:57.259 --> 00:42:58.895
I was fascinated by what he had to say,

967
00:42:58.895 --> 00:43:00.862
now he may be all wrong but I don't think so.

968
00:43:00.862 --> 00:43:02.632
I think he's really onto something.

969
00:43:02.632 --> 00:43:04.082
<v Regina>Oh no I think he is too I mean</v>

970
00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:06.101
he certainly seems to have bumped into some

971
00:43:06.101 --> 00:43:08.104
fundamental alternate truths here.

972
00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:09.471
<v ->That's right yeah.</v>

973
00:43:09.471 --> 00:43:12.408
<v Regina>And what this would indicate to me</v>

974
00:43:12.408 --> 00:43:15.811
is this world that we see and that we're experiencing

975
00:43:15.811 --> 00:43:19.515
and playing out in, is a reflection

976
00:43:19.515 --> 00:43:22.084
of our level of consciousness at this time.

977
00:43:22.084 --> 00:43:23.585
<v ->It would be yes.</v>

978
00:43:23.585 --> 00:43:26.856
<v Regina>So I ask you, do you ever imagine</v>

979
00:43:26.856 --> 00:43:29.992
the next phase, the next step for humanity?

980
00:43:29.992 --> 00:43:33.063
What might the continuation of our creation look like?

981
00:43:33.063 --> 00:43:35.798
And I know there're alternate scenarios there too.

982
00:43:35.798 --> 00:43:38.667
What do you see, what would you like to see?

983
00:43:38.667 --> 00:43:41.303
Two different questions I know.

984
00:43:41.303 --> 00:43:44.774
<v ->I guess what I'd like to see is a reality in which we are</v>

985
00:43:44.774 --> 00:43:48.178
more consciously aware of what we really are.

986
00:43:48.178 --> 00:43:51.347
I think that most of the problems in the world

987
00:43:51.347 --> 00:43:54.949
result from our not knowing our true nature

988
00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:58.087
and being driven by ego and the ego of course

989
00:43:58.087 --> 00:44:01.290
is possible because we don't know who we truly are.

990
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.559
If we are truly believe we were in some sense

991
00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:06.195
all conscious beings that we're connected at some level,

992
00:44:06.195 --> 00:44:08.363
manifestations of the same consciousness,

993
00:44:08.363 --> 00:44:11.600
we wouldn't have this sense of fierce individuality

994
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.870
that can be fine up to a point but that can take us

995
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.373
to the exploitation of others because we think

996
00:44:18.373 --> 00:44:20.893
that whatever we can get, we should get

997
00:44:20.893 --> 00:44:22.812
because after all, we have one life to live

998
00:44:22.812 --> 00:44:25.681
and you might as well maximize the pleasure

999
00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:28.451
and the gain of it and profit of it.

1000
00:44:28.451 --> 00:44:30.453
And I think that's exactly wrong,

1001
00:44:30.453 --> 00:44:32.455
the wrong perspective on life.

1002
00:44:32.455 --> 00:44:35.257
So if we had the knowledge of what we truly were,

1003
00:44:35.257 --> 00:44:38.527
and really believed that, I think human behavior

1004
00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:40.896
would be radically different, we'd have a much better world.

1005
00:44:40.896 --> 00:44:43.131
And that's about as far as I can go along the lines of

1006
00:44:43.131 --> 00:44:46.000
speculating what things might be like, maybe a century

1007
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.902
from now, maybe two centuries from now,

1008
00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:49.638
maybe only decades I don't know,

1009
00:44:49.638 --> 00:44:51.941
I'm certainly hoping for the latter.

1010
00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:54.076
<v Regina>Do you see things devolving</v>

1011
00:44:54.076 --> 00:44:56.698
a little bit more before they evolve?

1012
00:44:58.248 --> 00:45:01.182
<v ->Maybe so, the events of the last 10 years</v>

1013
00:45:01.182 --> 00:45:04.953
have been pretty discouraging, when I was a kid,

1014
00:45:04.953 --> 00:45:07.456
when I was in high school I guess,

1015
00:45:07.456 --> 00:45:09.425
2001 A Space Odyssey came out

1016
00:45:09.425 --> 00:45:11.710
and I thought "wow" and "this is terrific."

1017
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.079
Look at what's gonna happen to us in in the future.

1018
00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:16.733
I might even live long enough to experience some of this.

1019
00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:18.601
Now look what really happened in 2001.

1020
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:21.638
I mean it's such an opposite kind of situation

1021
00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:25.274
from what the expectations and hopes might have been.

1022
00:45:25.274 --> 00:45:28.911
It's been kind of a downer the last ten years,

1023
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:33.482
to see all the emergence of bombings and hatreds

1024
00:45:33.482 --> 00:45:36.552
and intolerance and dictatorships and all

1025
00:45:36.552 --> 00:45:38.854
of the ugly things that we've got

1026
00:45:38.854 --> 00:45:41.957
to outgrow if we're going to survive.

1027
00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:43.952
<v Regina>And what about the abandonment</v>

1028
00:45:43.952 --> 00:45:46.529
of the shuttle missions?

1029
00:45:46.529 --> 00:45:49.298
<v ->The shuttle is a funny thing, the shuttle never</v>

1030
00:45:49.298 --> 00:45:52.040
should've been built the way it was, it was,

1031
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.171
in order to try to save costs there were designs

1032
00:45:56.171 --> 00:45:58.239
that were made that were simply stupid.

1033
00:45:58.239 --> 00:46:00.743
For example instead of having the shell of the shutte

1034
00:46:00.743 --> 00:46:02.778
made out of a proper kind of material, now I've forgotten

1035
00:46:02.778 --> 00:46:05.481
what that was, they put tiles on it,

1036
00:46:05.481 --> 00:46:07.316
tiles that can crack and fall off and so

1037
00:46:07.316 --> 00:46:09.718
the shuttle was designed to be something that

1038
00:46:09.718 --> 00:46:12.687
could get man into space and that's low-Earth orbit

1039
00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:15.090
by the way, not even anywhere near the Moon,

1040
00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:16.992
into space very cheaply and easily,

1041
00:46:16.992 --> 00:46:18.993
so it'd be a cheap way for astronauts to go up,

1042
00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:21.163
fix things, put things in orbit, bring things back down.

1043
00:46:21.163 --> 00:46:23.099
It turned out to be enormously expensive.

1044
00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:25.201
Probably 10 times more expensive per flight

1045
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:27.702
than was originally estimated,

1046
00:46:27.702 --> 00:46:30.940
it's like over a billion dollars per shuttle launch,

1047
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.975
So it was a huge boondoggle and it kept us

1048
00:46:32.975 --> 00:46:36.679
in low-Earth orbit by that I mean the shuttle flies around,

1049
00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:39.081
I don't know, 200, 300 miles above the Earth.

1050
00:46:39.081 --> 00:46:41.516
That's it that's as far as it can go, it's not barely

1051
00:46:41.516 --> 00:46:44.019
in space at all, nowhere near going to the moon,

1052
00:46:44.019 --> 00:46:45.587
We can't go to the Moon now.

1053
00:46:45.587 --> 00:46:47.856
We went to the moon 40 years ago we can't now.

1054
00:46:47.856 --> 00:46:49.892
I think the shuttle was a huge boondoggle.

1055
00:46:49.892 --> 00:46:52.428
We unfortunately don't have anything in its place yet.

1056
00:46:52.428 --> 00:46:55.130
We are talking vaguely about doing other things

1057
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.867
like going and exploring an asteroid or a comet.

1058
00:46:57.867 --> 00:46:59.668
Well maybe but I'd be surprised if congress

1059
00:46:59.668 --> 00:47:01.603
passes the money for that, I think that

1060
00:47:01.603 --> 00:47:04.373
the best hope we have for a vibrant space program in the US,

1061
00:47:04.373 --> 00:47:06.141
is if the Chinese and the Russians, probably

1062
00:47:06.141 --> 00:47:07.943
not the Russians so much, they're pretty broke,

1063
00:47:07.943 --> 00:47:10.479
but the Chinese and the Indians, if they start getting

1064
00:47:10.479 --> 00:47:12.415
into space, then that'll be an impetus

1065
00:47:12.415 --> 00:47:15.384
for us to go back in too, but the shuttle was a very

1066
00:47:15.384 --> 00:47:18.020
mixed thing, it really kind of us bound to Earth

1067
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.456
even though it ostensibly goes up into quote space.

1068
00:47:21.456 --> 00:47:24.492
<v Regina>And yet 40 years ago we were on the Moon?</v>

1069
00:47:24.492 --> 00:47:26.595
<v ->Yeah 40 years ago we were on the Moon, yeah.</v>

1070
00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:28.663
<v Regina>Well that sounds like devolution to me.</v>

1071
00:47:28.663 --> 00:47:32.801
<v ->It does yeah, when I was a teenager and man first went</v>

1072
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:35.287
to the Moon, I thought well gee that's great,

1073
00:47:35.287 --> 00:47:37.073
we'll have a lunar base another 10 or 20 years,

1074
00:47:37.073 --> 00:47:39.307
then onto Mars and I'll live to see it.

1075
00:47:39.307 --> 00:47:41.877
Well it's not working out that way.

1076
00:47:41.877 --> 00:47:44.529
<v Regina>Any final thoughts?</v>

1077
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:47.782
<v ->I guess I would like to see, the things</v>

1078
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:50.385
I just talked about of course but I would like to see

1079
00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:52.388
science become more open to some

1080
00:47:52.388 --> 00:47:55.724
of the evidence that there is more to reality

1081
00:47:55.724 --> 00:47:57.725
than simply the physical universe and that does not

1082
00:47:57.725 --> 00:48:00.161
mean that anything within science has to be given up,

1083
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:02.165
we've conquered all this territory in sciecne

1084
00:48:02.165 --> 00:48:05.700
and made technology work for us and that's great,

1085
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.269
we don't need to give up any of that,

1086
00:48:07.269 --> 00:48:10.071
we just need to realize that the boundaries of that

1087
00:48:10.071 --> 00:48:13.608
perspective are not hard boundaries, they're only as far

1088
00:48:13.608 --> 00:48:16.212
as we've gone intellectually so far, beyond that

1089
00:48:16.212 --> 00:48:18.813
there lie new things, that which we're seeing glimpses

1090
00:48:18.813 --> 00:48:21.149
from people who are not scientists

1091
00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:24.120
but that are of areas where probably, not probably

1092
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.755
but certainly, there's a lot to be discovered.

1093
00:48:26.755 --> 00:48:29.324
A lot that will take us into new territory entirely.

1094
00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:31.494
If we just have the courage to say well,

1095
00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:33.361
we're not giving up science, but we're not gonna

1096
00:48:33.361 --> 00:48:36.165
draw a hard line around it, a hard boundary around it,

1097
00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:38.150
to try to protect it because there doesn't need to be,

1098
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:39.601
it does not need to be protected.

1099
00:48:39.601 --> 00:48:41.903
We need to explore what's beyond there.

1100
00:48:41.903 --> 00:48:43.706
<v Regina>On that note, thank you very much</v>

1101
00:48:43.706 --> 00:48:45.874
for spending the time with us I very much enjoyed it.

1102
00:48:45.874 --> 00:48:48.110
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1103
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.880
<v ->I hope you enjoyed this conversation.</v>

1104
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.816
I found Bernard to be refreshingly honest

1105
00:48:53.816 --> 00:48:55.985
in his appraisal of the future of science.

1106
00:48:55.985 --> 00:48:58.322
He's the kind of scientist that gives me hope.

1107
00:48:58.322 --> 00:49:00.056
For more on his books and work

1108
00:49:00.056 --> 00:49:02.257
you can go to The God Theory dot com.

1109
00:49:02.257 --> 00:49:05.394
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1110
00:49:05.394 --> 00:49:07.946
