00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:02.709
<v ->This may be one of the most important videos</v>

2
00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:04.582
you'll ever see when it comes to understanding

3
00:00:04.582 --> 00:00:06.431
health in the human body.

4
00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:07.778
In some very simple terms,

5
00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:09.606
with some surprising information,

6
00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:12.552
Raymond Francis tells us how to recover our health.

7
00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:14.543
How anybody can recover their health

8
00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.942
regardless of your current condition.

9
00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:18.810
He knows this because he once sat

10
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.781
at deaths certain door step.

11
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:21.938
Before he remembered something

12
00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.114
from his chemistry studies at MIT.

13
00:00:24.114 --> 00:00:25.961
A solution that costs pennies

14
00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.832
and ultimately saved his life.

15
00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.427
<v Voiceover>In your book, 'Never Be Sick Again",</v>

16
00:00:40.427 --> 00:00:43.068
you're saying that health is a choice,

17
00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:45.628
and that means conversely,

18
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.782
to be ill is also a choice.

19
00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:49.874
And that is not a choice we want to make.

20
00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:52.109
How can we begin recovering ourselves,

21
00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.001
a nation of chronically ill people?

22
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.965
<v ->Well I think first of all</v>

23
00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.998
we have to understand that health is a choice.

24
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.206
That most people in our society,

25
00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:05.092
including myself, before I took ill

26
00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:07.556
and almost died. (laughs)

27
00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:11.491
Think of disease as something like a meteorite

28
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.137
that falls out of the sky,

29
00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:15.210
hits you over the head, and bam,

30
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.323
you've got diabetes, you've got cancer,

31
00:01:17.323 --> 00:01:19.313
you've got something else.

32
00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:23.017
And I think that's the popular perception.

33
00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.205
It isn't that way, of course.

34
00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:27.014
Health is a choice.

35
00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:30.149
And, as a society, and as individuals,

36
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.926
we have the ability to make choices

37
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.120
that can restore the health to ourselves,

38
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.681
as individuals, and to our people as a society.

39
00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:41.215
<v Voiceover>But what we've done as a culture</v>

40
00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:43.510
is certainly in the west, the western world,

41
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.945
is we've turned over any of our innate knowledge

42
00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:49.382
about our own bodies, and put it in the hands

43
00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:51.637
of the medical profession,

44
00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:54.645
where we no longer have faith in our own bodies,

45
00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:57.795
we no longer have faith in our bodies ability to heal

46
00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:01.186
itselves, or our own ability to make correct decisions.

47
00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:02.568
And this can be,

48
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:04.274
we have been programmed

49
00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:06.509
to not have faith in ourselves, have we not?

50
00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.853
<v ->I think we have.</v>

51
00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.568
We've certainly given away our power

52
00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:13.770
to the medical profession.

53
00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:15.875
And they don't have a clue about

54
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:17.421
how to cure a disease.

55
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:18.761
I mean, that's obvious.

56
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.897
And if they did, we wouldn't have any disease.

57
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.676
And more than three out of four Americans

58
00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.789
have a diagnosable chronic disease.

59
00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.620
So that's a pretty sick population.

60
00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:31.743
So we do have the ability.

61
00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:34.790
And we need to understand this

62
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.943
and begin to accept this responsibility.

63
00:02:36.943 --> 00:02:40.830
In fact, I even read an ancient Buddhist text.

64
00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.262
It goes back thousands of years.

65
00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:44.745
And it says that,

66
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:47.941
"Keeping yourself in good health is a duty."

67
00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:49.627
Is a duty.

68
00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:52.262
And it's no different today.

69
00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:55.493
Health is not a, we think of it as a right,

70
00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:57.423
you know, we need a right to health care.

71
00:02:57.423 --> 00:03:00.328
It isn't, health is a responsibility,

72
00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:02.665
and we need to teach this to our children,

73
00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.635
we need to accept this responsibility,

74
00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:06.078
for ourselves.

75
00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:08.922
And the good news is that if you do this

76
00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.791
you will feel so good,

77
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.762
and life will be so wonderful.

78
00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:14.225
Most people don't even know

79
00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:15.952
what it feels like to be healthy

80
00:03:15.952 --> 00:03:17.252
because they've never been healthy

81
00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:18.918
in their entire lifetime.

82
00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:21.566
And they don't know the joy,

83
00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:23.902
the boundless energy,

84
00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:26.360
the mental acuity,

85
00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:31.216
the confidence that you're not going to get sick.

86
00:03:32.247 --> 00:03:36.803
For example, I flew back from Europe last fall

87
00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:41.734
on the leg from Brussels to New York,

88
00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:43.664
there was a seven hour leg.

89
00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:44.883
I sat next to a man

90
00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:47.626
who had one of the worst colds in the world.

91
00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.206
He sneezed his way to New York,

92
00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:51.387
(laughs)
blowing his nose.

93
00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:54.229
He had a huge box of Kleenex on his tray table.

94
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.733
He sneezed, and blew his nose,

95
00:03:55.733 --> 00:03:57.724
and he was like, anybody else,

96
00:03:57.724 --> 00:03:59.471
I don't know how many people on that plane

97
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.234
came down with that cold after that

98
00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:03.880
but I'm sure there was a lot.

99
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.790
I didn't.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

100
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.927
<v ->I didn't.
<v Voiceover>But you</v>

101
00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:08.471
weren't always this way.

102
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.604
<v ->Right, I used to be like everybody else.</v>

103
00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:12.067
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about how you used to be</v>

104
00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:13.612
and what happened.

105
00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:16.463
<v ->I ate a normal American diet.</v>

106
00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.671
And it was probably a better than average

107
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.810
normal American diet.

108
00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.653
I certainly didn't abuse myself,

109
00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:26.208
and certainly didn't abuse sugary things

110
00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:27.996
and what have you.

111
00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:31.389
But I ate, and lived a normal American lifestyle

112
00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.662
thinking that disease is a spin of the roulette wheel.

113
00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:37.382
And some people are gonna get sick

114
00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:38.541
and some don't.

115
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:42.157
And then I took sick and I went to

116
00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.864
36 top specialists.

117
00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:44.717
<v Voiceover>When you say you took sick</v>

118
00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:45.692
what was wrong?

119
00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:47.053
What were the symptoms, let's say?

120
00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.816
<v ->Well, my first symptom was a lack of energy.</v>

121
00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:51.827
And of course, that's the number one complaint

122
00:04:51.827 --> 00:04:54.367
made to doctors in America, lack of energy.

123
00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:55.565
So I went to my doctor and I said,

124
00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:57.759
"Doctor, I'm slowing down.

125
00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.396
"I need to get on a plane in Boston and fly to Tokyo.

126
00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:03.814
"Get off the plane and go into a business meeting,

127
00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:05.074
"and function."

128
00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:06.456
And I wasn't doing too well,

129
00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:08.182
I was dragging my tail.

130
00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:11.148
The doctor did thousands of dollars worth of testing.

131
00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.898
And I came back for the next visit

132
00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:14.623
and he sat behind his desk

133
00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:16.757
and gleefully announced

134
00:05:16.757 --> 00:05:18.198
that I was in perfect health.

135
00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:19.235
(laughs)

136
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.221
And I said, "Doc, if I'm in perfect health

137
00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.274
"how come I feel this way?"

138
00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:27.307
And he said, "You're getting older."

139
00:05:27.808 --> 00:05:30.084
And I said, "Doc, I've never felt this way before

140
00:05:30.084 --> 00:05:31.364
"in my entire life."

141
00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:34.358
And he said, "You've never been this old before."

142
00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:37.385
And I was 46 years old.
(laughs)

143
00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:39.614
(laughs) And I went away thinking

144
00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:41.278
if this is what getting old's all about.

145
00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:42.437
<v Voiceover>Time to go out to pasture.</v>

146
00:05:42.437 --> 00:05:43.879
<v ->I don't want to do this.</v>

147
00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.157
I mean, do other people feel this way?

148
00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:48.959
Well, two more years passed,

149
00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.888
I was really dragging my tail.

150
00:05:50.888 --> 00:05:53.084
and I developed a lot of allergies

151
00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:55.237
and I was very tired.

152
00:05:55.237 --> 00:05:57.315
Needed lots of sleep.

153
00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:58.873
I thought this time with all the allergies

154
00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:00.437
I'll go to an allergist.

155
00:06:00.437 --> 00:06:01.799
So I went to an allergist.

156
00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:03.810
He gave me a diagnostic test.

157
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.062
I suffered a catastrophic reaction to the test.

158
00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:10.399
Became totally disabled, and very ill.

159
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.725
For the next 10 months I went to 36

160
00:06:13.725 --> 00:06:15.534
top specialists.

161
00:06:15.534 --> 00:06:17.383
Not a one of them helped me.

162
00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:19.170
And finally one of them said,

163
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.284
"Oh, I can help you take this drug."

164
00:06:21.284 --> 00:06:22.949
(laughing)

165
00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.915
I took the drug, the drug poisoned my liver

166
00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:27.459
and my liver died.

167
00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.265
And my death was a medical certainty from liver failure.

168
00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:33.127
And at the last moment

169
00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:35.322
I used my own knowledge of biochemistry

170
00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:37.197
to save my life.

171
00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:39.752
And then it took me two years,

172
00:06:39.752 --> 00:06:41.377
two years to restore myself

173
00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:43.842
to where I could go back to work again.

174
00:06:43.977 --> 00:06:45.846
I was very, I was dead.

175
00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.295
I was dead.

176
00:06:47.655 --> 00:06:49.320
And two years of hard work,

177
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.275
went back to work.

178
00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:52.104
It was never the same again.

179
00:06:52.104 --> 00:06:55.070
I started, as a scientist.

180
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.310
<v Voiceover>And your background's from MIT.</v>

181
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.711
You were graduated from MIT?

182
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:58.775
<v ->I'm graduate of MIT.</v>

183
00:06:58.775 --> 00:06:59.946
Yes, so.
<v Voiceover>Serious science.</v>

184
00:06:59.946 --> 00:07:01.551
<v ->Yeah, a chemist by training.</v>

185
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:04.987
And a good scientist never stops asking

186
00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:06.901
the question, Why?

187
00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:09.766
So I kept asking, Why did I get sick?

188
00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:11.567
You know, How do you get sick?

189
00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:12.766
How do you take a healthy person

190
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.229
and make them a sick person?

191
00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:15.611
And if you have a sick person,

192
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:17.134
how do you make them healthy again?

193
00:07:17.134 --> 00:07:19.024
What do you have to do with the molecular level

194
00:07:19.024 --> 00:07:20.608
of the cellular level.

195
00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:22.681
And I started getting answers to these questions

196
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:25.485
and the answers were so profound,

197
00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:29.121
that finally in 1991 I resigned from everything,

198
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.234
I was president of an international management

199
00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:32.698
consulting firm.

200
00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:35.583
I was even on the board of directors of a hospital.

201
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:37.309
I resigned from everything,

202
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:39.158
devoted the rest of my life

203
00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:42.166
to improving the health of the American people.

204
00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.603
And as I learned more and more and more,

205
00:07:44.603 --> 00:07:47.467
and realized that health truly was a choice,

206
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.373
and that we already have the knowledge

207
00:07:50.373 --> 00:07:51.612
to end this epidemic.

208
00:07:51.612 --> 00:07:54.742
Here we have this unprecedented epidemic

209
00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.833
of chronic and degenerative disease.

210
00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.439
The cancer, the heart disease,

211
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:01.039
the diabetes, the osteoporosis,

212
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:04.250
the Alzheimers, all of,

213
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.981
asthma.

214
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:07.689
All these horrible chronic diseases.

215
00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:10.386
The knowledge we already have

216
00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:13.981
is sufficient to put an end to them tomorrow.

217
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:15.750
We don't need to do another dimes worth

218
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.904
of research, and I'm a scientist, I love research.

219
00:08:19.102 --> 00:08:21.783
But, so I think we should do more research.

220
00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:23.632
But if you ask this question,

221
00:08:23.632 --> 00:08:25.907
Do we need to do more research

222
00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:28.487
to end this epidemic of chronic disease?

223
00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:30.342
The answer is no.

224
00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:33.871
We already know how to stop heart disease,

225
00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:35.375
cancer, diabetes.

226
00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:36.878
All of these things can be stopped

227
00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:38.524
dead in their tracks,

228
00:08:38.524 --> 00:08:40.231
with what we already know.

229
00:08:40.231 --> 00:08:41.876
<v Voiceover>So what happened to you?</v>

230
00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:43.888
Let's take that story forward then.

231
00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:47.220
In the 11th hour, renal failure,

232
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.906
your death is a certainty,

233
00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:50.755
and you suddenly took back your own

234
00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:53.559
decision making powers about your own health.

235
00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:54.738
Where did you begin,

236
00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:56.444
and how did you begin rebuilding your own health?

237
00:08:56.444 --> 00:08:58.800
And let's use that as the journey forward.

238
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.895
<v ->Well, on my deathbed,</v>

239
00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:03.900
where I really was at the point

240
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.013
where I could not even move,

241
00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:08.370
I remember lying there.

242
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.423
I wanted to move my head.

243
00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:12.819
So I told my head to move.

244
00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:13.997
And it didn't.

245
00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:15.487
And it wouldn't.

246
00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:17.268
That's how far gone I was.

247
00:09:17.268 --> 00:09:18.203
I could not move.

248
00:09:18.203 --> 00:09:20.011
I would command my head to move,

249
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.191
it wouldn't move. (laughs)

250
00:09:22.693 --> 00:09:24.318
And I remembered,

251
00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:26.864
I knew I was dying of liver failure.

252
00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:30.129
And I remembered from my biochemistry

253
00:09:30.129 --> 00:09:33.875
that Vitamin C was a critical nutrient

254
00:09:34.437 --> 00:09:37.388
in terms of liver detoxification.

255
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.512
And then I also I had read a book

256
00:09:41.512 --> 00:09:44.880
and by a man who had

257
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.217
cured himself using Vitamin C.

258
00:09:47.217 --> 00:09:48.639
So I thought to myself,

259
00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:51.503
I wonder what would happen if I took some Vitamin C.

260
00:09:51.503 --> 00:09:52.539
<v Voiceover>Were you lucid enough to be able</v>

261
00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:54.774
to articulate what you wanted to?

262
00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:56.826
<v ->I was lucid enough, yes,</v>

263
00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:58.593
to articulate what I wanted.

264
00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:01.505
And I got some Vitamin C.

265
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.999
I took only three or four grams

266
00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:06.903
of Vitaminc C, which a doctor thinks is a lot.

267
00:10:06.903 --> 00:10:09.370
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->But really isn't that much.</v>

268
00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:11.089
And it was enough to turn me around

269
00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:15.504
within 24 hours my life signs stabilized.

270
00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:19.323
And within 36 hours I could sit up in bed.

271
00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:20.983
And that was the first improvement

272
00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:22.567
I've had in 10 months.

273
00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:24.437
<v Voiceover>Isn't that sad?</v>

274
00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:28.040
Four grams of Vitamin C, and you lived.

275
00:10:28.075 --> 00:10:29.299
<v ->Right.</v>

276
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.836
<v Voiceover>It's so sad.</v>

277
00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:33.985
<v ->And my doctor said that I was dead.</v>

278
00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:34.778
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->They said there</v>

279
00:10:34.778 --> 00:10:35.754
was nothing they could do.

280
00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:37.013
They don't know how.

281
00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:37.683
<v Voiceover>No.</v>
<v ->And it's not</v>

282
00:10:37.683 --> 00:10:39.126
that they're bad people,

283
00:10:39.126 --> 00:10:41.787
it's just that they've been inadequately trained

284
00:10:41.787 --> 00:10:43.516
and they simply don't understand it.

285
00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:45.444
They don't understand biochemistry.

286
00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.435
And health is all about biochemistry.

287
00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:48.858
And they don't understand it.

288
00:10:48.858 --> 00:10:50.748
<v Voiceover>So, you were sitting up in bed</v>

289
00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:53.063
and now you're getting your energy and your mind back.

290
00:10:53.063 --> 00:10:54.892
And, let's tell us what happens there,

291
00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:56.903
how you recovered the rest of yourself.

292
00:10:56.903 --> 00:10:58.346
What you discovered.

293
00:10:58.346 --> 00:11:00.885
<v ->Well, what I discovered, and ultimately,</v>

294
00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:02.592
and what I've written about in my books,

295
00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:04.624
especially in, "Never Be Sick Again",

296
00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:06.980
which is,"Never Be Sick Again"

297
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.962
is a breakthrough revolutionary book.

298
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.137
There were doctors all over the world

299
00:11:13.137 --> 00:11:14.701
that are reading "Never Be Sick Again"

300
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:16.245
and calling us and saying,

301
00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:19.253
"I'm changing the way I practice medicine."

302
00:11:19.253 --> 00:11:20.247
<v Voiceover>Excellent.</v>
<v ->Doctors are</v>

303
00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:23.478
calling and saying, "I've practiced medicine for 30 years.

304
00:11:23.478 --> 00:11:24.798
"I've read your book.

305
00:11:24.798 --> 00:11:27.176
"I'm changing the way I practice medicine."

306
00:11:27.176 --> 00:11:30.060
Because what I discovered is this,

307
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.866
on the bottom line, there's only one disease.

308
00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:36.786
There are not thousands of diseases.

309
00:11:36.786 --> 00:11:38.005
So what we're doing here is

310
00:11:38.005 --> 00:11:41.255
I've constructed a model of health

311
00:11:41.255 --> 00:11:42.840
that is so simple

312
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.122
that you can teach it to a child.

313
00:11:45.157 --> 00:11:46.701
And so powerful,

314
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:49.267
that you can cure almost anything.

315
00:11:49.504 --> 00:11:51.149
In fact, there are people that buy

316
00:11:51.149 --> 00:11:52.470
"Never Be Sick Again"

317
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.112
with stage four terminal cancer,

318
00:11:55.112 --> 00:11:57.936
go home, and cure their cancer.

319
00:11:57.936 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Voiceover>That's amazing.</v>

320
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.182
<v ->And this happens over, and over,</v>

321
00:12:01.182 --> 00:12:02.283
and over again.

322
00:12:02.283 --> 00:12:03.484
Well, why can they do that?

323
00:12:03.484 --> 00:12:06.144
Because there is no such thing as cancer.

324
00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:08.460
You see, there's only one disease.

325
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.877
And that's a malfunctioning cell.

326
00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:13.437
See, we're all made of little units of life

327
00:12:13.437 --> 00:12:14.845
called cells.

328
00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:17.786
And all of us started life

329
00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:20.230
as a single cell in our mother.

330
00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:23.697
If that cell was functioning the way it's supposed to,

331
00:12:23.697 --> 00:12:25.085
you were healthy.

332
00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:27.192
It's no different today.

333
00:12:27.192 --> 00:12:30.016
Now that we're made of multi trillions of cells,

334
00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:32.169
tens of trillions of cells,

335
00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.851
if every cell in your body is functioning,

336
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:36.720
the way it's supposed to,

337
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.597
you can't be sick.

338
00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:40.724
The only way you can be sick

339
00:12:40.724 --> 00:12:43.080
is when the large number of cells

340
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.914
malfunction.

341
00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:47.815
And then you'll start to notice symptoms.

342
00:12:47.815 --> 00:12:51.227
At first you may have a few aches or pains.

343
00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:53.665
Or you may feel less energetic.

344
00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:56.821
With me, my energy levels were down.

345
00:12:57.545 --> 00:13:00.147
Our doctors, unfortunately, don't know how

346
00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:04.217
to measure health when it's in its initial decline.

347
00:13:04.653 --> 00:13:06.075
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And there's</v>

348
00:13:06.075 --> 00:13:09.479
a long space between the initial decline

349
00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:11.131
and disease.

350
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:15.635
And so what I realized is that

351
00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:18.397
as cells began to malfunction

352
00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:19.942
more and more and more,

353
00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:21.363
you will get sicker, and sicker, and sicker,

354
00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:24.452
until finally you'd get a diagnosable disease.

355
00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:27.332
Well, the bottom line is this,

356
00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:30.360
cells malfunction for only two reasons.

357
00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:32.589
Either, they're not getting everything that they need

358
00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:34.316
to function properly,

359
00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:37.586
or they're getting something that is interfering

360
00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.173
with their normal function.

361
00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:40.796
<v Voiceover>Ie: toxins.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>

362
00:13:40.796 --> 00:13:43.375
So we call this the first problem,

363
00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:44.718
deficiency.

364
00:13:44.718 --> 00:13:47.054
And the second problem, toxicity.

365
00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:48.842
And you can simplify it even further

366
00:13:48.842 --> 00:13:50.691
for the average person, and say,

367
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:52.073
"Well, there's only one disease,

368
00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:53.677
"a malfunctioning cell.

369
00:13:53.677 --> 00:13:56.684
"And cells malfunction for only two reasons.

370
00:13:57.854 --> 00:14:00.423
"Not enough, or too much."

371
00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.176
(laughs)
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

372
00:14:02.312 --> 00:14:04.283
<v ->So if they're not getting enough of what they need,</v>

373
00:14:04.283 --> 00:14:07.920
and they're getting too much of what they don't need,

374
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.728
you get disease.

375
00:14:09.728 --> 00:14:11.964
So once I understood this I realized

376
00:14:11.964 --> 00:14:14.219
that all of the things that I had wrong with me,

377
00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:17.637
and I had four autoimmune diseases, by the way.

378
00:14:17.754 --> 00:14:19.256
I had lupus,

379
00:14:19.256 --> 00:14:21.044
I had Sjogren's syndrome,

380
00:14:21.044 --> 00:14:23.035
I had Hashimoto's thyroiditis,

381
00:14:23.035 --> 00:14:24.987
I had Fibromyalgia.

382
00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:27.952
I had so many problems,

383
00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:30.574
I had chemical sensitivities,

384
00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:32.382
I was one of the most chemical sensitive

385
00:14:32.382 --> 00:14:34.419
people in the world.

386
00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:37.324
I had chronic fatigue syndrome.

387
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.986
I suffered from seizures.

388
00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:42.278
I had so many problems

389
00:14:42.278 --> 00:14:44.044
and I would go to top specialists.

390
00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:45.975
My eyes were having problems

391
00:14:45.975 --> 00:14:48.452
I'd go to eye doctors.

392
00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:50.222
I went to so many top specialists,

393
00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:53.491
when I finally realized, it was all the same thing.

394
00:14:53.491 --> 00:14:54.466
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->It was</v>

395
00:14:54.466 --> 00:14:55.748
malfunction,

396
00:14:55.748 --> 00:14:57.473
at the cellular level

397
00:14:57.473 --> 00:15:00.451
caused by the cells not getting enough

398
00:15:00.451 --> 00:15:01.958
of what they need,

399
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.947
and getting too much of what they don't need.

400
00:15:03.947 --> 00:15:05.919
Well, once I understood this,

401
00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:10.027
that is so powerful, that you can literally

402
00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:13.522
eliminate almost any disease.

403
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.072
So, there's no such thing as a disease.

404
00:15:17.072 --> 00:15:18.839
And we have to get away from

405
00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:21.582
we give these symptoms names.

406
00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:23.749
But it's wrong to give symptoms names.

407
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:24.827
<v Voiceover>Oh but that means</v>

408
00:15:24.827 --> 00:15:26.980
the drug companies can create a magic pill

409
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.016
if we give it a name.

410
00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:29.520
<v ->Oh yes indeed, now the drug company</v>

411
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.161
can create a magic pill, which unfortunately

412
00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:33.298
just makes you sicker.

413
00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:34.497
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

414
00:15:34.497 --> 00:15:36.103
<v ->And doesn't help at all.</v>

415
00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:37.545
And it's crazy.

416
00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:39.149
Where did we get the idea

417
00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:41.262
that if somebody was sick

418
00:15:41.262 --> 00:15:42.420
we could help them

419
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.741
by giving them poison?

420
00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:44.939
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->I mean</v>

421
00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:47.390
hiragomy, you have a system here

422
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.399
that's only two causes of disease,

423
00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:51.249
deficiency and toxicity.

424
00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:54.628
Well, prescription drugs cause deficiencies.

425
00:15:54.945 --> 00:15:56.997
And they're toxic.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

426
00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:59.618
<v ->So drugs cause disease. (laughs)</v>

427
00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:01.101
And the more drugs you take

428
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:02.402
the sicker you get.

429
00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:04.964
Now unfortunately, we don't call it that.

430
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.829
So you start off with maybe one so-called disease,

431
00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:11.403
you take drugs, you end up with like six

432
00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.374
so-called diseases.

433
00:16:13.374 --> 00:16:15.425
But when you go back, the doctor doesn't say,

434
00:16:15.425 --> 00:16:17.396
"Oh my gosh, you started with one disease

435
00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:18.716
"and now you have six."

436
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:21.951
He goes, "Oh, these are side effects."

437
00:16:22.028 --> 00:16:24.484
Well, that sounds a lot better than a new disease.

438
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.724
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->But that's actually</v>

439
00:16:25.724 --> 00:16:27.310
what it is, is a

440
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.158
whole new set of problems

441
00:16:29.158 --> 00:16:31.697
caused by the deficiency and toxicity

442
00:16:31.697 --> 00:16:33.505
that the drugs induce.

443
00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:34.582
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->So not</v>

444
00:16:34.582 --> 00:16:35.821
a good way to go.

445
00:16:35.821 --> 00:16:37.691
Powerful, simple system.

446
00:16:37.691 --> 00:16:40.311
One disease, two causes of disease.

447
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:42.018
And what I began to realize

448
00:16:42.018 --> 00:16:44.804
is that all I had to do to get well

449
00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:48.038
was to give my cells what they needed.

450
00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:50.916
So I vastly improved my diet,

451
00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:53.071
found good supplements to take,

452
00:16:53.071 --> 00:16:56.057
and to get rid of the toxins.

453
00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:59.287
So I started identifying what in my life

454
00:16:59.287 --> 00:17:00.853
gave me toxins.

455
00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.595
And I found out, toothpaste, shampoo,

456
00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:06.886
you know, common things that we're all exposed to

457
00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.923
were highly toxic.

458
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:11.214
So I started using safe shampoos

459
00:17:11.214 --> 00:17:13.021
and safe toothpaste.

460
00:17:13.021 --> 00:17:15.764
And I started saunas, using saunas,

461
00:17:15.764 --> 00:17:18.202
to get stored toxins out of the body,

462
00:17:18.202 --> 00:17:20.437
and eventually I restored myself

463
00:17:20.437 --> 00:17:22.672
to good function.

464
00:17:22.672 --> 00:17:26.879
And now there, at age 48, I almost died.

465
00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.953
I'm now going on 72.

466
00:17:30.152 --> 00:17:32.629
I have boundless energy.

467
00:17:32.629 --> 00:17:34.438
I never get sick.

468
00:17:34.438 --> 00:17:37.445
I've had one cold in the last 21 years.

469
00:17:37.445 --> 00:17:38.278
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>
<v ->And I have</v>

470
00:17:38.278 --> 00:17:39.862
an excuse. (laughs)

471
00:17:39.862 --> 00:17:41.426
I made a speech in Egypt

472
00:17:41.426 --> 00:17:42.706
and I was flying back,

473
00:17:42.706 --> 00:17:43.763
it was bad weather,

474
00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:46.141
the planes got canceled, got delayed.

475
00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:48.659
I was up for 48 hours without sleep.

476
00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->I zonked</v>

477
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.362
my immunity.
<v Voiceover>Sure.</v>

478
00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:52.275
<v ->I got a cold.</v>

479
00:17:52.275 --> 00:17:54.551
One cold in 21 years.

480
00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:57.213
I've now got my arteries down

481
00:17:57.213 --> 00:17:58.452
to my late 20s.

482
00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:01.033
So here I am, I'm in my early 70s.

483
00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:03.329
The biological age of my arteries

484
00:18:03.329 --> 00:18:05.116
is in the late 20s.

485
00:18:05.116 --> 00:18:07.371
And by the time I'm 80,

486
00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:09.566
I want the biological age of my arteries

487
00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:11.820
to be down into my late teens.

488
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.324
Well, anybody can do that.

489
00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:16.697
So my probability, here I am, early 70s.

490
00:18:16.697 --> 00:18:18.790
My probability of having a heart attack

491
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.202
or a stroke, is that of someone in their late 20s.

492
00:18:22.202 --> 00:18:23.361
Anybody can do this.

493
00:18:23.361 --> 00:18:26.491
You want to keep your biological age

494
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.222
substantially younger

495
00:18:28.222 --> 00:18:30.480
than your chronological age.

496
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.327
And that way, you won't get sick,

497
00:18:32.327 --> 00:18:34.053
you won't become disabled,

498
00:18:34.053 --> 00:18:36.513
you won't end up in a nursing home,

499
00:18:36.513 --> 00:18:38.484
you won't get diseased.

500
00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:41.063
You'll live a long, happy, disease free life.

501
00:18:41.063 --> 00:18:42.424
<v Voiceover>Well let's talk about some of the power</v>

502
00:18:42.424 --> 00:18:43.177
players.

503
00:18:43.177 --> 00:18:45.520
This is very wonderful, empowering, and exciting.

504
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.137
Talk about some of the power players.

505
00:18:47.137 --> 00:18:49.535
What, in your book you're very specific

506
00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:51.782
about certain food groups that are packed

507
00:18:51.782 --> 00:18:54.565
with nutrients that our bodies really need.

508
00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:56.638
And you also look at the toxicity issue,

509
00:18:56.638 --> 00:18:57.633
and also supplements.

510
00:18:57.633 --> 00:18:59.482
So, let's start with foods and supplements.

511
00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:00.477
What are some of the,

512
00:19:00.477 --> 00:19:02.204
just a general, without giving us every,

513
00:19:02.204 --> 00:19:04.500
all the information, we don't have enough time.

514
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.089
<v ->Right.</v>

515
00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:07.080
Well I think, you know, for the average person,

516
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.234
I mean, I can certainly, I go through all the foods

517
00:19:09.234 --> 00:19:11.268
in my mind, and I understand

518
00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:12.851
which is better than the other.

519
00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:15.256
But, for average person,

520
00:19:15.256 --> 00:19:17.767
don't eat processed foods.

521
00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:20.530
Don't eat foods that come in boxes, and cans,

522
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.720
and jars, and which is what most people do.

523
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.585
90 cents out of the American food dollar

524
00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:28.698
is spent on processed foods.

525
00:19:28.698 --> 00:19:31.786
Well, processed foods are low in nutrition,

526
00:19:31.786 --> 00:19:33.858
and high in toxins.

527
00:19:33.858 --> 00:19:36.052
What are the two causes of disease?

528
00:19:36.052 --> 00:19:38.877
Malnutrition, and toxicity.

529
00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:42.580
So that's what processed foods cause disease.

530
00:19:43.102 --> 00:19:45.155
So, when you go to the supermarket,

531
00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:47.857
what you're buying is disease.

532
00:19:47.857 --> 00:19:50.213
People have to understand that.

533
00:19:50.213 --> 00:19:51.189
What is food?

534
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.789
Food is what nature provides.

535
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:57.121
An apple is, you know, pick it off the tree and eat it.

536
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:58.889
That's food.

537
00:19:58.889 --> 00:20:02.261
So, eat as much as possible,

538
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:05.126
eat food as nature provides it.

539
00:20:05.126 --> 00:20:06.752
And as much as possible,

540
00:20:06.752 --> 00:20:09.007
eat a plant based diet,

541
00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.857
as nature provides it.

542
00:20:10.857 --> 00:20:12.989
And yeah, you can have some animal protein

543
00:20:12.989 --> 00:20:14.920
in your diet, but not a lot.

544
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.194
<v Voiceover>And again, grass fed, organic, you want it.</v>

545
00:20:17.194 --> 00:20:18.436
<v ->Grass fed, organic.</v>

546
00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:20.021
Exactly, you want organic.

547
00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:23.229
You don't want any animal protein

548
00:20:23.229 --> 00:20:27.292
that is not organic, because otherwise it's loaded

549
00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:30.868
with pesticides and all kinds of other toxins.

550
00:20:30.868 --> 00:20:32.270
So you don't want that.

551
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.216
But grass fed organic beef is certainly

552
00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:37.572
okay to eat in moderation.

553
00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:40.112
And the same thing with eggs, and chicken.

554
00:20:40.112 --> 00:20:41.920
<v Voiceover>What about raw organic</v>

555
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.663
grass fed sourced milk?

556
00:20:44.663 --> 00:20:46.213
<v ->Well I,</v>

557
00:20:46.573 --> 00:20:48.890
there's a lot of question about the milk.

558
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.465
And basically my philosophy is, avoid milk.

559
00:20:52.465 --> 00:20:56.853
It is not something that nature intended us to eat.

560
00:20:56.853 --> 00:20:59.059
And if you look at mother nature,

561
00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:00.898
and I always go back to mother nature,

562
00:21:00.898 --> 00:21:04.310
if you look at nature, you find that after weaning,

563
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.463
no animal drinks milk.

564
00:21:06.463 --> 00:21:07.866
And in nature,

565
00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:11.142
no animal drinks the milk of another species.

566
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:13.050
We violate both of those.

567
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.140
We drink the milk of another species

568
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.150
and we drink milk after weaning.

569
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.041
Milk is--
<v Voiceover>And for the</v>

570
00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:20.809
most part, it's highly processed.

571
00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:21.743
<v ->And it's, exactly.</v>

572
00:21:21.743 --> 00:21:23.999
For the most part, highly processed.

573
00:21:23.999 --> 00:21:26.823
Certainly less dangerous if it's not highly processed.

574
00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:29.002
<v Voiceover>If it's raw.</v>
<v ->If it's raw.</v>

575
00:21:29.002 --> 00:21:32.578
But I don't recommend milk as a food at all.

576
00:21:32.578 --> 00:21:35.057
Because mother nature doesn't recommend it.

577
00:21:35.057 --> 00:21:36.865
And the milk of each species

578
00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:39.526
is unique to that species, by the way.

579
00:21:39.526 --> 00:21:44.409
So cross species feeding is not a good idea.

580
00:21:44.472 --> 00:21:46.007
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>

581
00:21:46.007 --> 00:21:49.197
<v ->And it is also unique to the needs of the infant</v>

582
00:21:49.197 --> 00:21:50.538
of the species.

583
00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:52.956
For instance, it's very high in fat.

584
00:21:52.956 --> 00:21:54.358
Well, you don't want an adult

585
00:21:54.358 --> 00:21:56.768
to be getting lots of fat, say.

586
00:21:57.118 --> 00:22:00.076
But you want the baby to be getting lots of fat.

587
00:22:00.124 --> 00:22:02.298
So it's not a good food,

588
00:22:02.298 --> 00:22:03.415
I don't recommend it at all.

589
00:22:03.415 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

590
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.341
So let's go onto the things that you

591
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:08.372
do recommend, that you're really high on.

592
00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:11.176
Applied to most human beings.

593
00:22:11.176 --> 00:22:13.544
<v ->I eat a lot of salads.</v>

594
00:22:13.544 --> 00:22:15.443
And that's what I recommend.

595
00:22:15.443 --> 00:22:17.982
In other words, plant based,

596
00:22:17.982 --> 00:22:21.436
as nature provides it, unprocessed,

597
00:22:21.436 --> 00:22:23.671
lots of vegetables.

598
00:22:23.671 --> 00:22:25.500
Lots of fruits.

599
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.470
Some fresh whole grains.

600
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.951
Some good high quality fish.

601
00:22:31.188 --> 00:22:32.672
Some organic meats,

602
00:22:32.672 --> 00:22:35.272
and organic eggs, in moderation.

603
00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:37.507
That makes up a good diet.

604
00:22:37.507 --> 00:22:39.458
Get rid of the sugar.

605
00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:42.586
In my book I talk about the big four.

606
00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:44.842
Sugar, white flour,

607
00:22:44.842 --> 00:22:46.629
processed oils,

608
00:22:46.629 --> 00:22:47.808
dairy.

609
00:22:47.808 --> 00:22:49.677
And excess animal protein.

610
00:22:49.677 --> 00:22:51.201
These are the causes of most

611
00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:53.111
of our diseases.

612
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:55.853
If we were to do just one thing,

613
00:22:55.853 --> 00:22:57.255
outlaw sugar,

614
00:22:57.255 --> 00:23:00.790
we would probably have an enormous impact

615
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.152
on the health of the population.

616
00:23:02.152 --> 00:23:03.127
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Reducing</v>

617
00:23:03.127 --> 00:23:05.424
everything from colds, and flu,

618
00:23:05.424 --> 00:23:07.251
to cancer and diabetes,

619
00:23:07.251 --> 00:23:08.877
and heart disease.

620
00:23:08.877 --> 00:23:12.723
Sugar is a deadly, deadly metabolic poison.

621
00:23:13.062 --> 00:23:14.626
If it were a new product today

622
00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:17.389
it would never be allowed on the market.

623
00:23:17.389 --> 00:23:19.015
Because the FDA couldn't do it,

624
00:23:19.015 --> 00:23:20.335
couldn't allow it on the market

625
00:23:20.335 --> 00:23:22.672
because we know how dangerous it is.

626
00:23:22.672 --> 00:23:25.821
So if you want to do just one thing in your life

627
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:28.015
get the sugar out of your life.

628
00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:30.616
Or at least substantially reduce it.

629
00:23:30.616 --> 00:23:32.424
And don't feed it to children.

630
00:23:32.424 --> 00:23:34.699
<v Voiceover>Now what happens if for people,</v>

631
00:23:34.699 --> 00:23:37.645
because we have been raised to have an incredible

632
00:23:37.645 --> 00:23:38.743
sweet tooth.

633
00:23:38.743 --> 00:23:40.693
And not just in the west, I mean globally.

634
00:23:40.693 --> 00:23:43.192
Not so much in certain Asian countries,

635
00:23:43.192 --> 00:23:45.589
but other than that, seeing sweets appear everywhere.

636
00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:47.398
But usually it's in a more natural form,

637
00:23:47.398 --> 00:23:49.064
if we're looking more indigenously.

638
00:23:49.064 --> 00:23:50.557
How do you feel about things like

639
00:23:50.557 --> 00:23:51.837
raw unprocessed honey

640
00:23:51.837 --> 00:23:53.973
or raw agave nectar?

641
00:23:53.973 --> 00:23:55.454
<v ->I think in moderation</v>

642
00:23:55.454 --> 00:23:57.607
both of those would be okay.

643
00:23:57.607 --> 00:23:59.253
But again, in moderation.

644
00:23:59.253 --> 00:23:59.944
<v Voiceover>In moderation.</v>

645
00:23:59.944 --> 00:24:01.935
But get rid of the deadly white stuff.

646
00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:04.515
<v ->Get rid of the deadly white stuff, exactly.</v>

647
00:24:04.515 --> 00:24:07.055
Even in the bible it cautions against

648
00:24:07.055 --> 00:24:08.538
eating too much honey.

649
00:24:08.538 --> 00:24:09.635
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->So.</v>

650
00:24:09.635 --> 00:24:11.707
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Honey is fine.</v>

651
00:24:11.707 --> 00:24:12.926
<v Voiceover>Because it does create</v>

652
00:24:12.926 --> 00:24:14.389
an insulin response, which starts a lot

653
00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:15.852
of these chains of reactions.

654
00:24:15.852 --> 00:24:16.990
<v ->Exactly.</v>

655
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.184
In fact there are some researchers

656
00:24:19.184 --> 00:24:22.902
who believe if there's a single key to disease,

657
00:24:22.902 --> 00:24:25.177
that single key would be insulin.

658
00:24:25.177 --> 00:24:25.990
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And when you</v>

659
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.369
eat white flour, when you eat sugar,

660
00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:31.638
your insulin level goes up

661
00:24:31.638 --> 00:24:35.214
and then that just blows all of your bodies chemistry.

662
00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:37.611
If you eat two teaspoons of sugar

663
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:40.253
and you body chemistry will be in chaos,

664
00:24:40.253 --> 00:24:42.244
for about six to eight hours.

665
00:24:42.244 --> 00:24:44.325
So if you eat sugar in the morning, for breakfast,

666
00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:46.439
and then some at lunch, and then some at dinner,

667
00:24:46.439 --> 00:24:48.855
your body chemistry will be in chaos

668
00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:51.456
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

669
00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:54.077
How can you expect to be healthy?

670
00:24:54.077 --> 00:24:55.377
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

671
00:24:55.377 --> 00:24:57.307
Let's talk about complex carbohydrates

672
00:24:57.307 --> 00:24:59.034
rather than simple carbohydrates.

673
00:24:59.034 --> 00:25:01.270
One of the new trends is sprouted grain

674
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.444
organic breads, for example.

675
00:25:03.444 --> 00:25:04.865
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>How are those,</v>

676
00:25:04.865 --> 00:25:06.409
how does that figure in?

677
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:07.833
Because it's a phenomena that's really

678
00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:09.376
only been made available, say, the last

679
00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:10.798
four or five years, for the most part.

680
00:25:10.798 --> 00:25:12.789
<v ->Exactly, and I think they're all right.</v>

681
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:13.886
Again, in moderation.

682
00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:15.715
One can make an argument

683
00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:17.361
that grains should not be a part

684
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:19.385
of the human diet.

685
00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:21.262
And in fact, they were not.

686
00:25:21.262 --> 00:25:23.618
Up until about 10,000 years ago.

687
00:25:23.618 --> 00:25:25.101
And then at that point

688
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:26.990
health began to deteriorate,

689
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.164
and it's still deteriorating.

690
00:25:29.164 --> 00:25:31.481
So, and if you look at the chemistry,

691
00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:32.700
one can make an argument

692
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.776
that grains should not be

693
00:25:33.776 --> 00:25:35.342
part of the human diet.

694
00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:37.075
Well today, if we took grains out of the

695
00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:39.066
human diet, everybody would starve to death

696
00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:40.386
because it's the biggest,

697
00:25:40.386 --> 00:25:42.927
the number one food in the world is grains.

698
00:25:42.927 --> 00:25:43.576
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

699
00:25:43.576 --> 00:25:45.466
<v ->So we're kind of stuck with them.</v>

700
00:25:45.466 --> 00:25:47.356
And I think it's okay.

701
00:25:47.356 --> 00:25:49.712
But again, eat them in moderation.

702
00:25:49.712 --> 00:25:50.484
And I do.

703
00:25:50.484 --> 00:25:53.308
I eat grains, but I eat them in moderation,

704
00:25:53.308 --> 00:25:56.376
probably two or three times a week.

705
00:25:56.376 --> 00:25:58.692
At a particular meal.

706
00:25:58.692 --> 00:26:00.886
So, some brown rice,

707
00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:02.999
or some quinoa,

708
00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:05.153
or some amaranth,

709
00:26:05.153 --> 00:26:08.078
or millets, or things like that.

710
00:26:08.078 --> 00:26:11.512
Pretty much stay away from the gluten grains,

711
00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:13.666
the rye,

712
00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:16.882
the barley,

713
00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:18.055
the wheat.

714
00:26:18.055 --> 00:26:20.309
Stay away from the gluten containing grains,

715
00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:22.422
because about half the population now

716
00:26:22.422 --> 00:26:23.805
is allergic to gluten.

717
00:26:23.805 --> 00:26:25.368
They're sensitive to gluten.

718
00:26:25.368 --> 00:26:26.201
And they don't know it.

719
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:27.543
Many of them don't know it.

720
00:26:27.543 --> 00:26:30.143
And they've all kinds of diseases

721
00:26:30.143 --> 00:26:31.504
and they don't know it's gluten.

722
00:26:31.504 --> 00:26:32.885
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about gluten alone.</v>

723
00:26:32.885 --> 00:26:34.937
Because again, this is talking about the,

724
00:26:34.937 --> 00:26:36.239
too much of.
<v ->Right.</v>

725
00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:38.046
<v Voiceover>So we're having the toxicity error,</v>

726
00:26:38.046 --> 00:26:39.631
an allergic reaction to gluten.

727
00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:42.231
What is the array of symptoms that you might see

728
00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:44.365
for people who are gluten intolerant, and don't know it.

729
00:26:44.365 --> 00:26:46.173
<v ->Okay, well if you're gluten intolerant</v>

730
00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:47.250
and you don't know it,

731
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.404
the symptoms can be anything.

732
00:26:49.404 --> 00:26:50.664
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Anything.</v>

733
00:26:50.664 --> 00:26:51.903
<v Voiceover>Anything from fatigue?</v>

734
00:26:51.903 --> 00:26:52.837
<v ->Fatigue.
<v Voiceover>Bloating,</v>

735
00:26:52.837 --> 00:26:54.079
headaches, aches, pains
<v ->Headaches.</v>

736
00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:54.807
Bloating.

737
00:26:54.807 --> 00:26:56.413
I had one woman that came to me,

738
00:26:56.413 --> 00:26:58.180
she had lived,

739
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.212
her life was a living hell.

740
00:27:00.212 --> 00:27:01.431
From the age of 18

741
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:02.976
to the age of 48,

742
00:27:02.976 --> 00:27:04.519
30 years,

743
00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:07.627
she had untreatable depression.

744
00:27:07.627 --> 00:27:09.192
She went to the Mayo Clinic.

745
00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:12.261
She went to every conceivable doctor and clinic.

746
00:27:12.261 --> 00:27:15.268
She took every conceivable antidepressant drug.

747
00:27:15.268 --> 00:27:18.031
She had untreatable depression.

748
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:20.184
She was often suicidal.

749
00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:24.186
Often could not get out of bed, she was so depressed.

750
00:27:24.186 --> 00:27:26.725
Her husband divorced her.

751
00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:29.733
Life was a living hell for 30 years.

752
00:27:29.733 --> 00:27:31.276
She came to me and I said,

753
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:32.537
"Well,

754
00:27:32.537 --> 00:27:35.055
"nothing seems to have helped.

755
00:27:35.055 --> 00:27:37.698
"Why don't you try getting off of gluten?"

756
00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:39.159
She got off of the gluten

757
00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:41.090
and she was the happiest woman in the world.

758
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.268
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>
<v ->In 48 hours</v>

759
00:27:42.268 --> 00:27:44.767
she was cured of 30 years

760
00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:47.185
of a living hell, in 48 hours,

761
00:27:47.185 --> 00:27:49.196
simply by getting off of gluten.

762
00:27:49.196 --> 00:27:52.386
So she had a cerebral allergy to gluten

763
00:27:52.386 --> 00:27:55.149
and that's what was causing her depression.

764
00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:57.038
<v Voiceover>And that's not uncommon, is it?</v>

765
00:27:57.038 --> 00:27:58.867
<v ->No, it is not uncommon.</v>

766
00:27:58.867 --> 00:28:02.180
Gluten can cause virtually any symptom.

767
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.394
<v Voiceover>That's it, okay.</v>

768
00:28:04.394 --> 00:28:07.381
Let's talk about some of the super nutrients,

769
00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:09.352
such as supplementation, that we can do.

770
00:28:09.352 --> 00:28:10.712
You talked about the example of

771
00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:12.439
three to four grams of Vitamin C,

772
00:28:12.439 --> 00:28:15.081
and you basically turned your life force around.

773
00:28:15.081 --> 00:28:17.071
<v ->Right, well supplementation today</v>

774
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:19.042
is an absolute necessity.

775
00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:21.277
And that's just not me saying this,

776
00:28:21.277 --> 00:28:24.162
a few years ago the National Academy of Sciences

777
00:28:24.162 --> 00:28:27.534
came out and issued a report, and they said that,

778
00:28:27.534 --> 00:28:30.114
"Even if you eat a good diet,

779
00:28:30.114 --> 00:28:32.288
"it is no longer possible

780
00:28:32.288 --> 00:28:34.137
"to get the nutrition that you need

781
00:28:34.137 --> 00:28:35.565
"without supplementing."

782
00:28:35.565 --> 00:28:38.038
And this is from the National Academy of Sciences.

783
00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:39.461
So it's not just me saying this.

784
00:28:39.461 --> 00:28:40.395
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->But I found</v>

785
00:28:40.395 --> 00:28:42.995
the same thing in my own studies.

786
00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:45.698
The nutrition content of the food

787
00:28:45.698 --> 00:28:47.954
has dropped dramatically.

788
00:28:47.954 --> 00:28:50.106
For instance, go to the store,

789
00:28:50.106 --> 00:28:51.652
buy a carrot.

790
00:28:51.652 --> 00:28:53.296
The carrot you buy today,

791
00:28:53.296 --> 00:28:54.861
you've got to eat four of them,

792
00:28:54.861 --> 00:28:57.380
four of them, to get the same magnesium

793
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.803
you got out of one carrot

794
00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.185
50 years ago.

795
00:29:00.185 --> 00:29:01.037
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->You've got to</v>

796
00:29:01.037 --> 00:29:03.942
eat between 10 and 20 carrots

797
00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.527
to get the same zinc

798
00:29:05.527 --> 00:29:07.132
you got out of one carrot

799
00:29:07.132 --> 00:29:08.779
50 years ago.

800
00:29:08.779 --> 00:29:10.567
You've got to eat five apples

801
00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:11.745
to get the same nutrition

802
00:29:11.745 --> 00:29:13.106
you got out of one apple

803
00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:14.366
50 years ago.

804
00:29:14.366 --> 00:29:16.357
So.
<v Voiceover>But are you</v>

805
00:29:16.357 --> 00:29:18.978
talking about produce that's mass produced

806
00:29:18.978 --> 00:29:21.050
to agri-business as we know it today?

807
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.082
Not necessarily from a backyard

808
00:29:23.082 --> 00:29:25.275
organic well kept garden?

809
00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:26.128
Is there a difference?

810
00:29:26.128 --> 00:29:26.840
<v ->An organic, yes,</v>

811
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.572
there would be a difference.

812
00:29:27.572 --> 00:29:29.156
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->The organic</v>

813
00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:30.537
backyard garden is going to give you

814
00:29:30.537 --> 00:29:32.956
a higher level of nutrition.

815
00:29:32.956 --> 00:29:34.825
And in fact what they found is

816
00:29:34.825 --> 00:29:37.689
is when you take normal farm

817
00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:41.103
and convert it to an organic farm,

818
00:29:41.103 --> 00:29:42.545
there was one experiment they did

819
00:29:42.545 --> 00:29:44.252
with 10 years.

820
00:29:44.252 --> 00:29:45.978
And they grew tomatoes.

821
00:29:45.978 --> 00:29:47.807
And with each passing year

822
00:29:47.807 --> 00:29:50.936
the nutritional content of the tomatoes increased.

823
00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:52.459
<v Voiceover>So this is a good case</v>

824
00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:54.897
for buying locally, buying organically.

825
00:29:54.897 --> 00:29:55.751
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Voiceover>And even</v>

826
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:56.971
creating your own little garden.

827
00:29:56.971 --> 00:29:57.925
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

828
00:29:57.925 --> 00:29:58.859
More and more people

829
00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:00.404
are doing their own little garden.

830
00:30:00.404 --> 00:30:01.846
And it's amazing what you can get out of

831
00:30:01.846 --> 00:30:02.659
a little garden.

832
00:30:02.659 --> 00:30:03.430
<v Voiceover>Yes it is.</v>
<v ->A little garden.</v>

833
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.453
<v Voiceover>We do it bio organically,</v>

834
00:30:04.453 --> 00:30:06.742
just you have to jump out of the way

835
00:30:06.742 --> 00:30:08.428
this stuff grows so fast.

836
00:30:08.428 --> 00:30:09.200
<v ->Right.</v>

837
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.948
So there's the problem.

838
00:30:10.948 --> 00:30:13.751
The nutritional content of the food

839
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:15.905
the soils are so depleted.

840
00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:18.160
Now the mineral are depleted.

841
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.664
And Linus Polly once said,

842
00:30:19.664 --> 00:30:21.777
"You could trace every disease

843
00:30:21.777 --> 00:30:23.138
"to a mineral deficiency."

844
00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:25.271
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->So</v>

845
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:26.673
we need to do something.

846
00:30:26.673 --> 00:30:28.847
And what we need to do is supplement.

847
00:30:28.847 --> 00:30:31.448
And that's what the National Academy of Sciences said.

848
00:30:31.448 --> 00:30:32.545
And a few years ago, even

849
00:30:32.545 --> 00:30:34.881
the Journal of the American Medical Association

850
00:30:34.881 --> 00:30:36.344
came out and said,

851
00:30:36.344 --> 00:30:38.518
"Everybody needs to take vitamins."

852
00:30:38.518 --> 00:30:40.753
I never thought I'd live long enough to see that.

853
00:30:40.753 --> 00:30:41.708
(laughs)
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

854
00:30:41.708 --> 00:30:42.520
(laughing)
<v ->In the</v>

855
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.755
Journal of the American Medical Association.

856
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:45.446
But they did.

857
00:30:45.446 --> 00:30:46.665
They came out and they said it.

858
00:30:46.665 --> 00:30:49.652
So, but we need a supplement.

859
00:30:49.652 --> 00:30:52.679
But that's a whole other challenge.

860
00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:54.853
Because most of the supplements on the market

861
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:58.164
are not something that I would take, or recommend.

862
00:30:58.164 --> 00:30:59.058
<v Voiceover>What about whole food</v>

863
00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:00.501
source vitamins.

864
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:01.314
Is that a?
<v ->It sounds</v>

865
00:31:01.314 --> 00:31:02.675
like a good idea,

866
00:31:02.675 --> 00:31:04.442
but in execution it's not.

867
00:31:04.442 --> 00:31:06.433
<v Voiceover>Okay, let's talk about why,</v>

868
00:31:06.433 --> 00:31:07.774
and what is.

869
00:31:07.774 --> 00:31:09.298
How you can find your way to really

870
00:31:09.298 --> 00:31:10.578
proper nutrients.

871
00:31:10.578 --> 00:31:11.492
Supplements.

872
00:31:11.492 --> 00:31:14.499
<v ->It's difficult, and in fact,</v>

873
00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:16.592
as a chemist I've been studying this now

874
00:31:16.592 --> 00:31:17.730
for 20 years.

875
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.883
And really, there's about,

876
00:31:19.883 --> 00:31:22.504
oh about four dozen people in the whole country

877
00:31:22.504 --> 00:31:24.759
that really know how to put a vitamin pill together

878
00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:25.796
and make it work.

879
00:31:25.796 --> 00:31:26.783
<v Voiceover>Who are they?</v>

880
00:31:26.783 --> 00:31:28.010
<v ->Ummm.
(laughs)

881
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.331
Well, I'm one of them.

882
00:31:29.331 --> 00:31:30.103
<v Voiceover>Yes, okay.</v>

883
00:31:30.103 --> 00:31:31.545
<v ->I'm one of them.
(laughs)

884
00:31:31.545 --> 00:31:33.049
And I've been working hard

885
00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:36.990
to achieve that level of knowledge and competence.

886
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.628
But I now have it, and I actually even make my own vitamins,

887
00:31:40.628 --> 00:31:41.663
at this point.

888
00:31:41.663 --> 00:31:43.695
But I wrote a report on this.

889
00:31:43.695 --> 00:31:46.723
And it's available to anyone, free of charge.

890
00:31:46.723 --> 00:31:49.425
All they have to do is go to my website

891
00:31:49.425 --> 00:31:52.959
and the website is beyondhealth.com,

892
00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:54.484
that's two words stuck together,

893
00:31:54.484 --> 00:31:57.755
beyond, and health, beyondhealth.com.

894
00:31:57.755 --> 00:31:58.648
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And right</v>

895
00:31:58.648 --> 00:32:00.578
on the front page of beyondhealth.com

896
00:32:00.578 --> 00:32:03.099
is a little button that says Free reports.

897
00:32:03.099 --> 00:32:04.113
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

898
00:32:04.113 --> 00:32:05.719
<v ->One of those reports is called</v>

899
00:32:05.719 --> 00:32:08.989
"The Road Map to Choosing Supplements."

900
00:32:08.989 --> 00:32:11.387
It is worth reading.

901
00:32:11.387 --> 00:32:12.769
Because if you go to a store

902
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:14.069
to buy supplements,

903
00:32:14.069 --> 00:32:15.695
it is bewildering.

904
00:32:15.695 --> 00:32:17.462
I mean, I walk into a vitamin store

905
00:32:17.462 --> 00:32:19.006
and you look at all those brands

906
00:32:19.006 --> 00:32:21.282
and it's bewildering.

907
00:32:21.282 --> 00:32:23.008
You need a road map

908
00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:24.776
to find your way through that.

909
00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.157
And that's what this is.

910
00:32:26.157 --> 00:32:28.230
"The Road Map to Choosing Supplements."

911
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.489
Available free of charge

912
00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:30.691
at beyondhealth.com.

913
00:32:30.691 --> 00:32:31.724
<v Voiceover>And you said there are</v>

914
00:32:31.724 --> 00:32:33.493
about four companies that are producing

915
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:36.153
absorbable quality supplements.

916
00:32:36.153 --> 00:32:37.474
<v ->About that, yeah.</v>

917
00:32:37.474 --> 00:32:39.262
Very, very few.

918
00:32:39.262 --> 00:32:41.334
It varies all over the map,

919
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:44.139
from things that have absolutely

920
00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:46.434
no nutritional value whatsoever,

921
00:32:46.434 --> 00:32:49.527
to things that maybe are 10% or 25%

922
00:32:49.527 --> 00:32:51.681
bio available.

923
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:54.419
But when you get up into where I'm at,

924
00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:57.120
at like 95% bio available,

925
00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.066
that's rarefied atmosphere.

926
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:01.266
<v Voiceover>What is the difference?</v>

927
00:33:01.266 --> 00:33:02.545
What makes it bio available?

928
00:33:02.545 --> 00:33:04.699
I mean, without going into the chemistry of it,

929
00:33:04.699 --> 00:33:06.730
what's the difference between that type of supplement

930
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:07.970
and others?

931
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.773
<v ->Well first of all, the form that the vitamin is in.</v>

932
00:33:10.773 --> 00:33:11.972
Is very important.

933
00:33:11.972 --> 00:33:15.284
The purity of the vitamin is very important.

934
00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:16.767
And how it's compounded

935
00:33:16.767 --> 00:33:18.840
and mixed with other things.

936
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.460
And any fillers that are put in there,

937
00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.122
that can reduce the bio availability.

938
00:33:24.122 --> 00:33:27.312
But I'll give you a very specific example.

939
00:33:27.312 --> 00:33:29.974
Go to the store, pick up a multivitamin.

940
00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:32.961
The Vitamin B12, in about 90%,

941
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:36.393
more than 90% of all the supplements you pick up,

942
00:33:36.393 --> 00:33:39.543
will be in the form called cyanocobalamin.

943
00:33:39.543 --> 00:33:40.436
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

944
00:33:40.436 --> 00:33:41.636
<v ->Cyanacobalamin</v>

945
00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:44.561
has very poor bio availability.

946
00:33:44.561 --> 00:33:46.186
Very poor bio availability.

947
00:33:46.186 --> 00:33:48.502
But also, it breaks down in the body

948
00:33:48.502 --> 00:33:51.494
and puts cyanide into the body.

949
00:33:51.494 --> 00:33:52.769
<v Voiceover>Not good.</v>
<v ->Cyanide.</v>

950
00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:54.756
Yeah, not good.

951
00:33:54.756 --> 00:33:57.117
So then better brands will say,

952
00:33:57.117 --> 00:33:58.965
Well we know cyanocobalamin is not good,

953
00:33:58.965 --> 00:34:00.814
so we'll use the more expensive

954
00:34:00.814 --> 00:34:02.440
methylcobalamin.

955
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.674
Well, methylcobalamin is good,

956
00:34:04.674 --> 00:34:07.053
but the problem is the body carefully regulates

957
00:34:07.053 --> 00:34:09.225
the amount of methylcobalamin in the blood,

958
00:34:09.225 --> 00:34:10.770
so if you take some,

959
00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:12.984
and then you get too much in the blood,

960
00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:16.113
it very quickly gets rid of it.

961
00:34:16.113 --> 00:34:18.288
So the half life of methylcobalamin

962
00:34:18.288 --> 00:34:20.218
in the blood is about five minutes.

963
00:34:20.218 --> 00:34:22.818
So if you want a few minutes worth of B12.

964
00:34:22.818 --> 00:34:24.382
<v Voiceover>Right, not adequate.</v>

965
00:34:24.382 --> 00:34:26.657
So what is your source?

966
00:34:26.657 --> 00:34:29.828
<v ->I use a source called hydroxocobalamin.</v>

967
00:34:29.828 --> 00:34:32.224
Which is the perfect solution.

968
00:34:32.224 --> 00:34:33.707
It is very pure,

969
00:34:33.707 --> 00:34:34.825
it works very well,

970
00:34:34.825 --> 00:34:37.019
it's highly bio available.

971
00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:38.402
The half life is in hours,

972
00:34:38.402 --> 00:34:40.190
not in minutes.

973
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.119
So why doesn't everybody use it?

974
00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:44.740
It costs more than $3000 a pound.

975
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.040
<v Voiceover>Ah, that's why, yes I understand.</v>

976
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.320
<v ->That's why they don't do it.</v>

977
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.275
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->So</v>

978
00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:49.353
that's bio availability.

979
00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:51.100
But you take something as mundane as

980
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.338
Vitamin C.

981
00:34:52.338 --> 00:34:55.203
Almost all of the Vitamin C on the market

982
00:34:55.203 --> 00:34:56.524
is junk.

983
00:34:56.524 --> 00:34:57.479
I wouldn't take it.

984
00:34:57.479 --> 00:34:59.287
I don't recommend it to everybody.

985
00:34:59.287 --> 00:35:01.786
Almost all the Vitamin C on the market

986
00:35:01.786 --> 00:35:03.757
today comes out of China.

987
00:35:03.757 --> 00:35:05.809
They're not making it correctly.

988
00:35:05.809 --> 00:35:07.352
And I'll give you a specific example.

989
00:35:07.352 --> 00:35:09.425
When you sythesize Vitamin C

990
00:35:09.425 --> 00:35:11.355
you get two molecules.

991
00:35:11.355 --> 00:35:13.387
One of them is called D-ascorbate.

992
00:35:13.387 --> 00:35:15.622
The other is called L-ascorbate.

993
00:35:15.622 --> 00:35:18.527
They're both exactly the same molecule.

994
00:35:18.527 --> 00:35:20.356
The only thing different about them

995
00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:21.677
is their shape.

996
00:35:21.677 --> 00:35:22.631
And it's just like,

997
00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:24.378
here's a perfect example.

998
00:35:24.378 --> 00:35:25.821
I've got two hands,

999
00:35:25.821 --> 00:35:27.995
they're both exactly the same.

1000
00:35:27.995 --> 00:35:29.823
But they're both fundamentally different.

1001
00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:30.921
Because this is the left hand

1002
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.383
this is the right hand.

1003
00:35:32.383 --> 00:35:33.704
So they're both the same

1004
00:35:33.704 --> 00:35:35.593
but they're both fundamentally different.

1005
00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:37.443
That's the same as the D-ascorbate

1006
00:35:37.443 --> 00:35:39.210
and the L-ascorbate.

1007
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.100
It's the L-ascorbate molecule

1008
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.863
that is the biologically active molecule.

1009
00:35:43.863 --> 00:35:45.814
The D-ascorbate is not.

1010
00:35:45.814 --> 00:35:47.398
And the D-ascorbate is actually

1011
00:35:47.398 --> 00:35:48.861
an irritant to the body.

1012
00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:49.979
It can irritate your stomach,

1013
00:35:49.979 --> 00:35:51.502
irritate your gut.

1014
00:35:51.502 --> 00:35:53.453
It can actually interfere with

1015
00:35:53.453 --> 00:35:56.013
the metabolism of the L-ascorbate.

1016
00:35:56.013 --> 00:35:58.837
So when you buy 1000 milligrams

1017
00:35:58.837 --> 00:36:00.868
of Vitamin C, you're only getting

1018
00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:03.916
500 milligrams of the biologically active molecule.

1019
00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:04.911
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->And you</v>

1020
00:36:04.911 --> 00:36:05.826
don't want that.

1021
00:36:05.826 --> 00:36:08.711
You want a Vitamin C that's 100%

1022
00:36:08.711 --> 00:36:10.153
L-ascorbate.

1023
00:36:10.153 --> 00:36:10.824
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

1024
00:36:10.824 --> 00:36:13.363
<v ->100% the active biologically active molecule.</v>

1025
00:36:13.363 --> 00:36:15.172
Then it goes downhill from there.

1026
00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:17.527
Because unless you're really careful,

1027
00:36:17.527 --> 00:36:19.742
about how you make the Vitamin C,

1028
00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:22.283
and you allow oxygen into the system,

1029
00:36:22.283 --> 00:36:25.147
the oxygen oxidizes the Vitamin C

1030
00:36:25.147 --> 00:36:27.423
and then you get oxidized Vitamin C.

1031
00:36:27.423 --> 00:36:30.105
And oxidized Vitamin C is a free radical.

1032
00:36:30.105 --> 00:36:31.263
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->And free</v>

1033
00:36:31.263 --> 00:36:33.519
radicals are not good.

1034
00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:36.038
And so many,

1035
00:36:36.038 --> 00:36:39.247
I've seen Vitamin C formulations out there

1036
00:36:39.247 --> 00:36:43.026
that are as high as 25% oxidized Vitamin C.

1037
00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:45.545
Highly advertised brands,

1038
00:36:45.545 --> 00:36:48.085
10% oxidized Vitamin C.

1039
00:36:48.085 --> 00:36:51.316
You want a Vitamin C that has no

1040
00:36:51.316 --> 00:36:52.819
oxidized Vitamin C.

1041
00:36:52.819 --> 00:36:53.895
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And then</v>

1042
00:36:53.895 --> 00:36:56.964
almost all the Vitamin C is made from corn.

1043
00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:58.670
If you are sensitive to corn,

1044
00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:00.722
and I'd say at least half the population today

1045
00:37:00.722 --> 00:37:02.327
is sensitive to corn,

1046
00:37:02.327 --> 00:37:03.749
you'll get an allergic reaction

1047
00:37:03.749 --> 00:37:05.374
when you take that Vitamin C.

1048
00:37:05.374 --> 00:37:07.041
Even though you don't realize it.

1049
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:09.560
So.
<v Voiceover>I'm getting</v>

1050
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.165
the idea why you're saying it's important

1051
00:37:11.165 --> 00:37:13.054
for people to read this report on your site.

1052
00:37:13.054 --> 00:37:14.578
<v ->Extremely important, yes,</v>

1053
00:37:14.578 --> 00:37:15.513
because you need to know.

1054
00:37:15.513 --> 00:37:17.138
These are subtle things,

1055
00:37:17.138 --> 00:37:20.166
and this is just the tip of the iceberg,

1056
00:37:20.166 --> 00:37:22.197
by the way, that the chemistry

1057
00:37:22.197 --> 00:37:24.798
gets much more complex than this.

1058
00:37:24.798 --> 00:37:27.541
But I make my own Vitamin C now,

1059
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:30.405
and it's as 100% L-ascorbate,

1060
00:37:30.405 --> 00:37:32.336
completely corn free,

1061
00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:36.236
and completely free of any oxidized Vitamin C.

1062
00:37:36.236 --> 00:37:37.495
And that's what you want to be taking.

1063
00:37:37.495 --> 00:37:38.512
<v Voiceover>Excellent, yes.</v>

1064
00:37:38.512 --> 00:37:39.670
<v ->And it's so pure</v>

1065
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.726
I give it to people who are

1066
00:37:40.726 --> 00:37:41.966
chemically sensitive,

1067
00:37:41.966 --> 00:37:43.835
and I used to be chemically sensitive,

1068
00:37:43.835 --> 00:37:44.831
and they come back and say,

1069
00:37:44.831 --> 00:37:47.025
"This is the only Vitamin C

1070
00:37:47.025 --> 00:37:49.239
"I have ever been able to take

1071
00:37:49.239 --> 00:37:50.763
"because it's so pure."

1072
00:37:50.763 --> 00:37:52.267
<v Voiceover>That is fabulous.</v>

1073
00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:54.705
I mean, that you, A, you have the where with all

1074
00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.858
to do it, with your background in biochemistry,

1075
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:58.950
thank God, that you're motivated to do this.

1076
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.612
Because I think all too often

1077
00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:02.933
this is a venture,

1078
00:38:02.933 --> 00:38:04.557
it's a corporate venture,

1079
00:38:04.557 --> 00:38:06.020
to offer something to the public

1080
00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.565
without any genuine understanding.

1081
00:38:07.565 --> 00:38:08.215
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>How could</v>

1082
00:38:08.215 --> 00:38:10.003
it have gotten this way?

1083
00:38:10.003 --> 00:38:10.938
How could it have become like this

1084
00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:13.091
where there's so little oversight

1085
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:14.778
as to the quality?

1086
00:38:15.438 --> 00:38:17.968
<v ->There is some oversight as to the quality,</v>

1087
00:38:17.968 --> 00:38:19.613
as to what goes in.

1088
00:38:19.613 --> 00:38:22.397
But there's no oversight as to

1089
00:38:22.397 --> 00:38:25.342
how active those substances are.

1090
00:38:25.342 --> 00:38:26.338
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1091
00:38:26.338 --> 00:38:28.939
<v ->And unfortunately, it's got that way.</v>

1092
00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:29.711
And manufacturers,

1093
00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:32.332
I've been a consultant to vitamin companies.

1094
00:38:32.332 --> 00:38:34.079
So I know how think,

1095
00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.237
and I know that they do.

1096
00:38:35.237 --> 00:38:36.212
And a lot of them just say,

1097
00:38:36.212 --> 00:38:37.797
"Well let's make some vitamins."

1098
00:38:37.797 --> 00:38:40.032
And they go to a compounder and they say,

1099
00:38:40.032 --> 00:38:41.982
"Will you make us a formula?"

1100
00:38:41.982 --> 00:38:43.100
And the compounder says,

1101
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.258
"Yeah, I've got a formula."

1102
00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:45.517
I give it this and this and this,

1103
00:38:45.517 --> 00:38:47.061
and I tweak it a little bit,

1104
00:38:47.061 --> 00:38:48.098
make it a little bit different,

1105
00:38:48.098 --> 00:38:50.027
and then that's your unique formula.

1106
00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:50.597
<v Voiceover>Your label.</v>
<v ->And that's</v>

1107
00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:52.263
how they do it.

1108
00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:54.151
So it's just a new label,

1109
00:38:54.151 --> 00:38:56.651
but actually there's no science behind it.

1110
00:38:56.651 --> 00:38:58.988
And unfortunately, that's what they do.

1111
00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:00.958
And even when there is science behind it.

1112
00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:03.401
For instance, I was consulting for a company

1113
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:06.586
that had iron in their multivitamin.

1114
00:39:06.586 --> 00:39:09.187
And I explained to them that you can't do that.

1115
00:39:09.187 --> 00:39:12.031
Because if you put iron into the multivitamin

1116
00:39:12.031 --> 00:39:14.428
it can actually cause a reaction

1117
00:39:14.428 --> 00:39:16.379
in the pill, in the product,

1118
00:39:16.379 --> 00:39:19.345
that will damage the Vitamin C,

1119
00:39:19.345 --> 00:39:20.828
and the Vitamin E, so

1120
00:39:20.828 --> 00:39:24.525
it can damage the antioxidants

1121
00:39:24.525 --> 00:39:26.029
while it's in the pill.

1122
00:39:26.029 --> 00:39:28.346
So here you are, you want to get Vitamin C,

1123
00:39:28.346 --> 00:39:30.580
but it's all been damaged because

1124
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.673
there's iron in the multivitamins.

1125
00:39:32.673 --> 00:39:33.506
So I told them, "You really have to

1126
00:39:33.506 --> 00:39:36.119
"get the iron out of the multivitamin."

1127
00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:39.276
And their technical people understood that,

1128
00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:41.084
but the marketing people came back and said,

1129
00:39:41.084 --> 00:39:42.404
"No way are we going to take

1130
00:39:42.404 --> 00:39:44.335
"the iron out of our multivitamin

1131
00:39:44.335 --> 00:39:47.708
"because people want to see iron in the formula."

1132
00:39:47.708 --> 00:39:48.500
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

1133
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.207
<v ->"And we're afraid if we take it out</v>

1134
00:39:50.207 --> 00:39:51.771
"people won't buy the product."

1135
00:39:51.771 --> 00:39:53.051
So the iron stayed in

1136
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:55.164
even though it was ruining the product.

1137
00:39:55.164 --> 00:39:56.261
(laughing)

1138
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:58.354
That's the level of mentality.

1139
00:39:58.354 --> 00:39:59.715
<v Voiceover>Well in general, it's just a very</v>

1140
00:39:59.715 --> 00:40:03.047
complex business to extract solo nutrients

1141
00:40:03.047 --> 00:40:05.465
out of things we used to get from our produce.

1142
00:40:05.465 --> 00:40:06.846
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>And so</v>

1143
00:40:06.846 --> 00:40:09.000
but here we are, we're kind of stuck with it now

1144
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.006
because of the lack of nutrient in the food supply.

1145
00:40:12.006 --> 00:40:15.034
So we will encourage everybody to read that report

1146
00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:16.050
and start.

1147
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.021
Is it affordable for people?

1148
00:40:18.021 --> 00:40:19.504
I mean, this is a real question,

1149
00:40:19.504 --> 00:40:22.043
you're talking about better science, it sounds like,

1150
00:40:22.043 --> 00:40:25.579
in terms of, not just the intellectual knowledge

1151
00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:27.956
you're bringing to it, but the actual sources themselves

1152
00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:30.008
sound like they're a little more costly.

1153
00:40:30.008 --> 00:40:31.897
<v ->Well, they are a little more costly,</v>

1154
00:40:31.897 --> 00:40:34.315
but actually when you look at it,

1155
00:40:34.315 --> 00:40:37.505
and analyze what you get for what you pay,

1156
00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:39.902
they're the least expensive vitamins on the market.

1157
00:40:39.902 --> 00:40:41.020
<v Voiceover>Fabulous.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

1158
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:41.832
<v Voiceover>Fabulous.</v>
<v ->And that's--</v>

1159
00:40:41.832 --> 00:40:43.153
<v Voiceover>Available on your website, as well?</v>

1160
00:40:43.153 --> 00:40:45.063
<v ->Yeah, available on beyondhealth.com.</v>

1161
00:40:45.063 --> 00:40:46.485
The least bit, if you take,

1162
00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:49.918
if you spend a dollar to buy a vitamin,

1163
00:40:49.918 --> 00:40:52.214
and you're only getting 10% of that,

1164
00:40:52.214 --> 00:40:54.490
you're getting 10 cents worth of value.

1165
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.074
When you buy something that really works

1166
00:40:56.074 --> 00:40:57.636
and you spend a dollar,

1167
00:40:57.636 --> 00:40:58.980
you're getting a dollars worth of value,

1168
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.016
that's a better deal.

1169
00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:01.113
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1170
00:41:01.113 --> 00:41:03.510
Well let's talk about the detoxification part of this.

1171
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.339
Now we've talked about the supplementation

1172
00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:07.432
food sources a bit, and we encouraged people

1173
00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:09.037
to study up on that a little bit more

1174
00:41:09.037 --> 00:41:10.256
through your report.

1175
00:41:10.256 --> 00:41:11.718
But what about ridding the body

1176
00:41:11.718 --> 00:41:13.527
of things that are essentially

1177
00:41:13.527 --> 00:41:15.254
blocking our paths to health?

1178
00:41:15.254 --> 00:41:16.248
The toxins.

1179
00:41:16.248 --> 00:41:19.763
<v ->Well the toxins have become extremely important.</v>

1180
00:41:19.763 --> 00:41:22.304
Because the average American today

1181
00:41:22.304 --> 00:41:24.539
is in toxic overload.

1182
00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:26.895
I mean, this is a real crisis.

1183
00:41:26.895 --> 00:41:30.105
And this load increases every year.

1184
00:41:30.105 --> 00:41:32.786
Because they're storing in our tissues.

1185
00:41:32.786 --> 00:41:34.717
So there are three things you have to do.

1186
00:41:34.717 --> 00:41:36.221
Number one,

1187
00:41:36.221 --> 00:41:39.065
stop putting the toxins in.

1188
00:41:39.065 --> 00:41:41.483
Well, we live in a toxic world.

1189
00:41:41.483 --> 00:41:43.393
We are in toxic overload.

1190
00:41:43.393 --> 00:41:44.856
That's the bad news.

1191
00:41:44.856 --> 00:41:45.709
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

1192
00:41:45.709 --> 00:41:47.415
<v ->Here's the good news.</v>

1193
00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:49.569
80% of our toxic load

1194
00:41:49.569 --> 00:41:51.459
is under our personal control.

1195
00:41:51.459 --> 00:41:52.332
<v Voiceover>Very good.</v>

1196
00:41:52.332 --> 00:41:55.847
<v ->So we can cut 80% of our toxic load out,</v>

1197
00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:57.899
if we just pay attention to it.

1198
00:41:57.899 --> 00:41:59.138
And I mentioned before,

1199
00:41:59.138 --> 00:42:00.561
personal care products, like

1200
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:02.836
toothpaste, and shampoo.

1201
00:42:02.836 --> 00:42:05.403
Toothpaste is a deadly poison.

1202
00:42:05.403 --> 00:42:06.453
Buy a tube,

1203
00:42:06.453 --> 00:42:08.423
go look at a tube of toothpaste,

1204
00:42:08.423 --> 00:42:09.825
look at what it says on the box,

1205
00:42:09.825 --> 00:42:11.715
it says if you swallow any of this, you know,

1206
00:42:11.715 --> 00:42:13.969
call the poison control center. (laughs)

1207
00:42:13.969 --> 00:42:14.843
<v Voiceover>Exactly. (laughs)</v>

1208
00:42:14.843 --> 00:42:15.697
<v ->Get an ambulance.</v>

1209
00:42:15.697 --> 00:42:17.220
Rush to the hospital.

1210
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.045
You know, don't swallow this product.

1211
00:42:20.045 --> 00:42:21.406
One tube of toothpaste

1212
00:42:21.406 --> 00:42:23.803
is sufficient to kill a small child.

1213
00:42:23.803 --> 00:42:26.891
So why do you want to use that every day.

1214
00:42:26.891 --> 00:42:28.415
There are chemicals in there that go

1215
00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:30.244
right through the mucous membranes

1216
00:42:30.244 --> 00:42:31.055
of the mouth.

1217
00:42:31.055 --> 00:42:32.966
The mucous membrane are very porous.

1218
00:42:32.966 --> 00:42:34.449
Very permeable.

1219
00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:35.342
And it goes right through,

1220
00:42:35.342 --> 00:42:36.745
it gets into the bloodstream,

1221
00:42:36.745 --> 00:42:39.244
bio-accumulates in your tissues

1222
00:42:39.244 --> 00:42:41.256
year after year after year.

1223
00:42:41.256 --> 00:42:43.592
Well, how much of this gunk

1224
00:42:43.592 --> 00:42:46.010
can you put into yourselves

1225
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.289
year after year after

1226
00:42:47.289 --> 00:42:50.053
before the poor cell croaks?

1227
00:42:50.053 --> 00:42:51.292
And that's what's happening.

1228
00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:52.368
People are getting sick,

1229
00:42:52.368 --> 00:42:53.039
and they never say,

1230
00:42:53.039 --> 00:42:53.994
"Well gosh, I'm sorry,

1231
00:42:53.994 --> 00:42:57.677
"I brush my teeth with X brand of toothpaste."

1232
00:42:58.037 --> 00:42:59.419
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Well there</v>

1233
00:42:59.419 --> 00:43:00.719
are safe brands of toothpaste.

1234
00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:01.613
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And the</v>

1235
00:43:01.613 --> 00:43:03.035
same thing with shampoo.

1236
00:43:03.035 --> 00:43:04.132
<v Voiceover>When you say safe brands,</v>

1237
00:43:04.132 --> 00:43:05.839
I mean, some of them I've used over the years

1238
00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:09.720
are basically baking soda based, right?

1239
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.934
<v ->Mm-hmm.
<v Voiceover>I've kind of</v>

1240
00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:13.437
settled on Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap.

1241
00:43:13.437 --> 00:43:15.143
Is that reasonable enough?

1242
00:43:15.143 --> 00:43:15.976
Clean enough?

1243
00:43:15.976 --> 00:43:17.237
<v ->Yes, sure.</v>

1244
00:43:17.237 --> 00:43:18.232
<v Voiceover>Yeah?</v>
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1245
00:43:18.232 --> 00:43:19.166
<v Voiceover>I mean, you get used to the</v>

1246
00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:20.568
soapy taste after a little bit,

1247
00:43:20.568 --> 00:43:22.132
but your teeth feel squeaky clean.

1248
00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.839
So there's some very inexpensive simple

1249
00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:25.831
fixes to this.
<v ->Very inexpensive.</v>

1250
00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:27.436
And simple, yeah.

1251
00:43:27.436 --> 00:43:29.528
That anybody can do just learning

1252
00:43:29.528 --> 00:43:31.276
where the toxins are.

1253
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.921
Here we are, we're sitting in a room

1254
00:43:32.921 --> 00:43:33.835
with a carpet.
<v Voiceover>Mm- hmm.</v>

1255
00:43:33.835 --> 00:43:35.990
<v ->Well, it's an older carpet.</v>

1256
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.776
So it isn't off gassing as much as.

1257
00:43:37.776 --> 00:43:40.317
But new carpets, new carpets.

1258
00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:42.409
If you take a piece of new carpet,

1259
00:43:42.409 --> 00:43:43.831
and put it in a chamber

1260
00:43:43.831 --> 00:43:45.273
and put some mice in the chamber,

1261
00:43:45.273 --> 00:43:47.183
they'll be dead the next day.

1262
00:43:47.183 --> 00:43:49.663
That's how toxic this stuff is.

1263
00:43:49.663 --> 00:43:51.003
And people are breathing it.

1264
00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:52.222
Their children are breathing it.

1265
00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:54.458
Their pets are breathing it.

1266
00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:55.513
<v Voiceover>Kids are rolling around on it</v>

1267
00:43:55.513 --> 00:43:57.728
and playing on it.
<v ->Exactly,</v>

1268
00:43:57.728 --> 00:43:58.886
and highly toxic.

1269
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:01.508
So learn about where the toxins

1270
00:44:01.508 --> 00:44:03.052
are coming from

1271
00:44:03.052 --> 00:44:05.286
and simply get them out of your life.

1272
00:44:05.286 --> 00:44:06.566
<v Voiceover>And your book talks about this.</v>

1273
00:44:06.566 --> 00:44:07.867
<v ->We have a whole chapter.</v>

1274
00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:09.146
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it's in depth.</v>

1275
00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.263
<v ->On toxins.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1276
00:44:10.263 --> 00:44:11.848
<v ->In "Never Be Sick Again."</v>

1277
00:44:11.848 --> 00:44:14.104
So simple to do.

1278
00:44:14.104 --> 00:44:16.461
The next part, the next step,

1279
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:18.735
one is, stop putting toxins in.

1280
00:44:18.735 --> 00:44:20.260
And that's sensible, stop putting them in.

1281
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.194
(laughing)
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1282
00:44:21.194 --> 00:44:23.205
<v ->If you want to detoxify</v>

1283
00:44:23.205 --> 00:44:24.967
stop putting them in.

1284
00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:26.740
And the next thing is,

1285
00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.341
help your body's detoxfication system.

1286
00:44:29.341 --> 00:44:33.710
Because if you supply a molecule of a toxin

1287
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:38.464
to the liver, it requires many molecules

1288
00:44:38.464 --> 00:44:41.694
to detoxify that one molecule.

1289
00:44:41.694 --> 00:44:42.710
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Well, where</v>

1290
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.169
do those mini molecules come from?

1291
00:44:45.169 --> 00:44:47.565
They come from your diet.

1292
00:44:47.565 --> 00:44:50.187
So, you have to eat a good diet,

1293
00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:52.300
you have to get on a good supplement program,

1294
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.814
and that will give your body's detoxification

1295
00:44:55.814 --> 00:44:59.782
mechanisms the means to work properly.

1296
00:45:00.528 --> 00:45:01.706
<v Voiceover>What about water intake?</v>

1297
00:45:01.706 --> 00:45:03.169
The fluid part of it?

1298
00:45:03.169 --> 00:45:05.079
<v ->Water is very important.</v>

1299
00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:07.213
There's certainly controversy about how much

1300
00:45:07.213 --> 00:45:08.640
is necessary.

1301
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.484
<v Voiceover>Where are you settled at</v>

1302
00:45:10.484 --> 00:45:12.312
on that issue?

1303
00:45:12.312 --> 00:45:14.648
<v ->Well I think it depends on the individual</v>

1304
00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:16.498
and their lifestyle, and where they live.

1305
00:45:16.498 --> 00:45:19.747
I mean, if you live in Phoenix, Arizona,

1306
00:45:19.747 --> 00:45:21.921
you need to drink more water than you do

1307
00:45:21.921 --> 00:45:23.831
if you live in Boston, because you're gonna

1308
00:45:23.831 --> 00:45:25.393
be losing more.

1309
00:45:25.393 --> 00:45:28.037
So it's hard to say.

1310
00:45:28.037 --> 00:45:29.662
A lot of people go overboard

1311
00:45:29.662 --> 00:45:32.609
and end up drinking, I think, too much water.

1312
00:45:32.609 --> 00:45:34.985
But many of us drink too little.

1313
00:45:34.985 --> 00:45:37.484
So I try to, you know,

1314
00:45:37.484 --> 00:45:38.967
when I get up in the morning,

1315
00:45:38.967 --> 00:45:41.730
I make a big glass of Vitamin C.

1316
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:43.153
So first thing in the morning

1317
00:45:43.153 --> 00:45:44.798
I have a big glass of water.

1318
00:45:44.798 --> 00:45:46.769
And I do that before I go to bed again.

1319
00:45:46.769 --> 00:45:48.720
I have another big glass.

1320
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.523
So, and I try to do that during the day.

1321
00:45:51.523 --> 00:45:53.901
So if you do this faithfully

1322
00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:56.643
you'll probably get the water that you need.

1323
00:45:56.643 --> 00:45:59.061
And if you're losing a lot of water,

1324
00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:00.808
for instance, on a really hot day.

1325
00:46:00.808 --> 00:46:02.759
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->I'll get thirsty.</v>

1326
00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:04.932
Because I'm losing a lot of water,

1327
00:46:04.932 --> 00:46:06.761
and my body's control mechanism says,

1328
00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:08.041
Oh, you need more fluid.

1329
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:09.524
So I drink more.

1330
00:46:09.524 --> 00:46:11.190
But I don't go overboard on that.

1331
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:12.368
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1332
00:46:12.368 --> 00:46:13.811
<v Voiceover>Now you wrote another book</v>

1333
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:15.132
called "Never be Fat Again."

1334
00:46:15.132 --> 00:46:17.427
And a lot of the same principles apply.

1335
00:46:17.427 --> 00:46:18.362
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>If you're</v>

1336
00:46:18.362 --> 00:46:19.967
going for perfect health

1337
00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:21.756
and ridding your body of toxins,

1338
00:46:21.756 --> 00:46:23.746
this is automatically going to have an effect

1339
00:46:23.746 --> 00:46:26.387
on ones weight.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1340
00:46:26.387 --> 00:46:27.362
Absolutely, automatically.
<v Voiceover>So this</v>

1341
00:46:27.362 --> 00:46:29.883
is a double bonus here.

1342
00:46:29.883 --> 00:46:31.671
<v ->Absolutely double bonus.</v>

1343
00:46:31.671 --> 00:46:33.356
People get on a good diet

1344
00:46:33.356 --> 00:46:35.206
and you'll lose weight.

1345
00:46:35.206 --> 00:46:37.196
Well, what causes the weight?

1346
00:46:37.196 --> 00:46:38.619
Sugar and white flour

1347
00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:41.198
are two of the big causes of overweight.

1348
00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.113
So you get the sugar

1349
00:46:42.113 --> 00:46:43.861
and the white flour out of your life

1350
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:45.282
and you're going to be losing weight.

1351
00:46:45.282 --> 00:46:45.871
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->But in</v>

1352
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:47.456
"Never Be Fat Again"

1353
00:46:47.456 --> 00:46:51.439
one of the things that I discovered, in my research,

1354
00:46:51.439 --> 00:46:54.242
is the effect of toxins, on overweight.

1355
00:46:54.242 --> 00:46:55.096
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->And this</v>

1356
00:46:55.096 --> 00:46:57.675
you don't see that in your popular diet books.

1357
00:46:57.675 --> 00:46:58.305
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->They don't</v>

1358
00:46:58.305 --> 00:46:59.220
talk about this.

1359
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.271
But toxicity is one of the leading

1360
00:47:01.271 --> 00:47:03.121
causes of overweight.

1361
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:06.595
And there's whole classes of toxins.

1362
00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:08.769
Artificial sweeteners,

1363
00:47:08.769 --> 00:47:11.755
artificial flavor enhancers,

1364
00:47:11.755 --> 00:47:14.152
some prescription drugs,

1365
00:47:14.152 --> 00:47:15.737
pesticides,

1366
00:47:15.737 --> 00:47:18.704
whole classes of toxins

1367
00:47:18.704 --> 00:47:21.060
that will make you pack on the pounds

1368
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.270
because they jam the body's two control mechanisms.

1369
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.672
The appetite control,

1370
00:47:25.672 --> 00:47:28.091
and the fat storage control.

1371
00:47:28.091 --> 00:47:28.965
Now those are what keep

1372
00:47:28.965 --> 00:47:31.017
your body in good shape.

1373
00:47:31.017 --> 00:47:34.003
So if you jam both of those in the on position

1374
00:47:34.003 --> 00:47:35.871
you're always going to be hungry.

1375
00:47:35.871 --> 00:47:38.289
And, your body will always store fat

1376
00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:39.630
no matter how little you eat.

1377
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.199
<v Voiceover>So it really wrecks</v>

1378
00:47:40.199 --> 00:47:41.094
your metabolism.

1379
00:47:41.094 --> 00:47:42.150
<v ->It wrecks your metabolism,</v>

1380
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.227
exactly, yeah.

1381
00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.609
<v Voiceover>So we're going to encourage people</v>

1382
00:47:44.609 --> 00:47:46.639
to also check into that book,

1383
00:47:46.639 --> 00:47:48.265
so you can look at the complexities.

1384
00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:50.764
If you're overweight, and not just feeling ill,

1385
00:47:50.764 --> 00:47:52.145
but overweight as well, then this

1386
00:47:52.145 --> 00:47:53.852
gives another layer of information.

1387
00:47:53.852 --> 00:47:55.884
<v ->If you're more than five pounds overweight</v>

1388
00:47:55.884 --> 00:47:57.998
you really should read "Never Be Fat Again"

1389
00:47:57.998 --> 00:47:59.277
as well.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:47:59.277 --> 00:48:02.650
<v ->Because overweight is a disease,</v>

1391
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.778
it is a very serious chronic disease.

1392
00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:10.228
<v Voiceover>And a very large portion of our population</v>

1393
00:48:10.228 --> 00:48:12.239
and of many other western countries.

1394
00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:15.307
Australia, England, are both finding

1395
00:48:15.307 --> 00:48:17.176
huge rises in obesity, as well.

1396
00:48:17.176 --> 00:48:17.785
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>So it's not</v>

1397
00:48:17.785 --> 00:48:18.862
just an American problem.

1398
00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:19.756
<v ->It's global.</v>

1399
00:48:19.756 --> 00:48:20.487
It's global.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1400
00:48:20.487 --> 00:48:21.483
<v ->Well, we've exported our diet. (laughs)</v>

1401
00:48:21.483 --> 00:48:22.235
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

1402
00:48:22.235 --> 00:48:23.739
It's even starting in Asia now.

1403
00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:24.531
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Because</v>

1404
00:48:24.531 --> 00:48:25.912
of western food influences.

1405
00:48:25.912 --> 00:48:27.135
<v ->Yes yes.
<v Voiceover>It's sad.</v>

1406
00:48:27.135 --> 00:48:29.711
<v ->China, the latest report from China.</v>

1407
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:32.293
25% of the population is now overweight.

1408
00:48:32.293 --> 00:48:33.226
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:48:33.226 --> 00:48:35.625
<v ->Here in America it's more than two thirds.</v>

1410
00:48:35.625 --> 00:48:36.356
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And going</v>

1411
00:48:36.356 --> 00:48:37.615
up to 70%.

1412
00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:39.768
So they've got a long way to catch up with us.

1413
00:48:39.768 --> 00:48:42.430
But maybe they'll catch up if they keep trying.

1414
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.361
<v Voiceover>So let's encourage people to,</v>

1415
00:48:44.361 --> 00:48:46.371
let's encourage people to check this information out,

1416
00:48:46.371 --> 00:48:46.981
as well.

1417
00:48:46.981 --> 00:48:48.342
And then before we wrap it up

1418
00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:49.846
I just have one quick question.

1419
00:48:49.846 --> 00:48:51.979
We have a rapid rise,

1420
00:48:51.979 --> 00:48:53.990
and this is not, this is global, as well,

1421
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:55.373
in childhood diabetes.

1422
00:48:55.373 --> 00:48:56.145
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>What's going</v>

1423
00:48:56.145 --> 00:48:56.855
on there?

1424
00:48:56.855 --> 00:48:57.811
And what can we do?

1425
00:48:57.811 --> 00:48:58.988
I mean, I assume what we have to do

1426
00:48:58.988 --> 00:49:01.101
is similar to what you would do for anything else,

1427
00:49:01.101 --> 00:49:02.828
but what's causing this?

1428
00:49:02.828 --> 00:49:04.150
<v ->Well, first and foremost,</v>

1429
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.384
the diet of the mother.

1430
00:49:07.354 --> 00:49:10.001
Mothers are eating diets

1431
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:12.276
that are inadequate in nutrition.

1432
00:49:12.276 --> 00:49:14.470
And high in toxins.

1433
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:18.819
And the toxins are actually affecting the fetus

1434
00:49:18.819 --> 00:49:23.023
and programming genes in the fetus

1435
00:49:23.023 --> 00:49:26.193
and programming the brain in the fetus,

1436
00:49:26.193 --> 00:49:26.965
to do things.

1437
00:49:26.965 --> 00:49:30.562
So, for instance,

1438
00:49:30.562 --> 00:49:32.147
glutamate's a whole class

1439
00:49:32.147 --> 00:49:33.608
of flavor enhancers

1440
00:49:33.608 --> 00:49:36.393
that are in 80% of all processed foods.

1441
00:49:36.393 --> 00:49:38.750
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Contain glutamates.</v>

1442
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.127
Glutamates, if the mother is eating a lot

1443
00:49:41.127 --> 00:49:44.357
of glutamates, it can actually affect the genes

1444
00:49:44.357 --> 00:49:46.327
and the brain of the child,

1445
00:49:46.327 --> 00:49:48.116
so that the child is programmed

1446
00:49:48.116 --> 00:49:50.838
to be overweight for the rest of their life.

1447
00:49:50.838 --> 00:49:54.108
And that's one reason why you're seeing childhood obesity.

1448
00:49:54.108 --> 00:49:57.787
And the same thing happens for the childhood diabetes.

1449
00:49:57.787 --> 00:49:58.945
<v Voiceover>What can we do though?</v>

1450
00:49:58.945 --> 00:50:00.468
Once this happens and they've been diagnosed,

1451
00:50:00.468 --> 00:50:01.443
what can they do?

1452
00:50:01.443 --> 00:50:04.592
<v ->Well, once the child is born,</v>

1453
00:50:04.592 --> 00:50:05.933
what could you do?

1454
00:50:05.933 --> 00:50:09.427
Well, do what we tell you in 'Never Be Sick Again."

1455
00:50:09.427 --> 00:50:12.007
Eat a good diet, get on good supplement program,

1456
00:50:12.007 --> 00:50:15.908
avoid toxins, and you'll make the best of a bad situation.

1457
00:50:15.908 --> 00:50:17.493
<v Voiceover>Any particular supplements that work well</v>

1458
00:50:17.493 --> 00:50:19.079
in this situation?

1459
00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:20.948
Chromium, or I don't know.

1460
00:50:20.948 --> 00:50:22.003
Is it there anything?

1461
00:50:22.003 --> 00:50:24.279
<v ->Well I don't think that people should go off</v>

1462
00:50:24.279 --> 00:50:26.088
and just do one thing at a time.

1463
00:50:26.088 --> 00:50:29.217
We have multiple vitamins, multis,

1464
00:50:29.217 --> 00:50:32.366
that are scientifically designed to be synergistic.

1465
00:50:32.366 --> 00:50:33.239
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1466
00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:35.454
<v ->So all the things in there are synergistic.</v>

1467
00:50:35.454 --> 00:50:36.733
And that's what you want.

1468
00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.765
Nutrients act as a team.

1469
00:50:38.765 --> 00:50:41.894
And I see some people taking large amounts

1470
00:50:41.894 --> 00:50:43.885
of one nutrient all by itself,

1471
00:50:43.885 --> 00:50:46.445
and that can really upset a lot of other chemistry.

1472
00:50:46.445 --> 00:50:47.319
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->So there's</v>

1473
00:50:47.319 --> 00:50:48.598
a lot of chemistry to this

1474
00:50:48.598 --> 00:50:50.854
and people shouldn't be self-medicating.

1475
00:50:50.854 --> 00:50:54.125
And I actually put together what I call kits.

1476
00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:56.015
It's a group of supplements

1477
00:50:56.015 --> 00:50:57.802
that are scientifically designed

1478
00:50:57.802 --> 00:50:59.529
to do certain things.

1479
00:50:59.529 --> 00:51:01.135
We actually have a diabetes kit.

1480
00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:02.394
<v Voiceover>We might as well take advantage</v>

1481
00:51:02.394 --> 00:51:03.633
of your 20 years of research

1482
00:51:03.633 --> 00:51:05.483
rather than trying to put it together ourselves.

1483
00:51:05.483 --> 00:51:06.600
Right? (laughs)

1484
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.880
<v ->Yes yes yes, absolutey.</v>

1485
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.262
<v Voiceover>Why not, absolutely.</v>

1486
00:51:09.262 --> 00:51:11.739
Well, anything before we wrap up here?

1487
00:51:11.739 --> 00:51:12.837
Any final messages that you

1488
00:51:12.837 --> 00:51:13.995
haven't been able to convey

1489
00:51:13.995 --> 00:51:15.580
in this interview yet?

1490
00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.506
<v ->Well, I think the final message is this.</v>

1491
00:51:18.506 --> 00:51:21.391
That, no matter what you have,

1492
00:51:21.391 --> 00:51:23.848
no matter what disease you have,

1493
00:51:23.848 --> 00:51:25.738
you can make it better.

1494
00:51:25.738 --> 00:51:27.607
Maybe you can't cure it completely,

1495
00:51:27.607 --> 00:51:29.253
but you can make it better.

1496
00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:31.245
And you have the power to do that.

1497
00:51:31.245 --> 00:51:34.108
And I've seen people with Multiple Sclerosis,

1498
00:51:35.308 --> 00:51:38.152
ALS, you know, Lou Gehrig's disease,

1499
00:51:38.152 --> 00:51:41.530
all improve their situations vastly.

1500
00:51:42.946 --> 00:51:45.730
People with cancer, completely cured.

1501
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:47.823
So health is a choice.

1502
00:51:47.823 --> 00:51:49.732
You can choose it.

1503
00:51:49.732 --> 00:51:52.150
But you have to learn how to do it.

1504
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.894
And read my books and you'll.

1505
00:51:54.894 --> 00:51:57.128
<v Voiceover>They're excellent guides to this.</v>

1506
00:51:57.128 --> 00:51:58.794
I have read.
<v ->And just put it to use.</v>

1507
00:51:58.794 --> 00:52:01.192
And the power is there

1508
00:52:01.192 --> 00:52:02.716
I mean, it's just so wonderful.

1509
00:52:02.716 --> 00:52:05.397
I wish I could shout this from the rooftops.

1510
00:52:05.397 --> 00:52:07.780
You don't have to be sick.

1511
00:52:09.562 --> 00:52:11.106
<v ->For more information you can pick up</v>

1512
00:52:11.106 --> 00:52:13.382
a copy of his book "Never Be Sick Again"

1513
00:52:13.382 --> 00:52:15.962
from his site at beyondhealth.com.

1514
00:52:15.962 --> 00:52:17.465
Some of the products he spoke about

1515
00:52:17.465 --> 00:52:19.315
are also available on the site,

1516
00:52:19.315 --> 00:52:21.529
including the high absorbency Vitamin C.

1517
00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:24.746
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
