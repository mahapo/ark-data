(reflective music)

2
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:14.533
<v ->It would be impossible to count the number of lives</v>

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.470
that have been enriched, even changed,

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.699
by the work of Don Miguel Ruiz.

5
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:19.975
When The Four Agreements came out

6
00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.064
about 15 years ago, it remained on

7
00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:25.364
the New York Times bestseller List for seven years.

8
00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:27.982
Direct and simple in its message and language,

9
00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:29.537
Don Miguel shared the wisdom of

10
00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:32.948
his Toltec Shamanic traditions in its pages.

11
00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:34.280
I've always included it in my list

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.590
of the top five books to live by.

13
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.865
Now, he and his son, Don Jose, have written a new book

14
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:42.266
that is an extension of the previous four agreements

15
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.309
called naturally, The Fifth Agreement.

16
00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:49.475
As we come out of the baby stage,

17
00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:53.089
and we start having all these symbols, words,

18
00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.228
perceptions of others, parents, and schools, teachers,

19
00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.325
and so forth reflected back at us.

20
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.847
Our little canvas of life starts becoming,

21
00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:05.654
essentially cluttered with other people's perceptions

22
00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:08.755
that we're now buying into because they say

23
00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:11.912
we're smart or they say we're stupid,

24
00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:14.973
or that we're not good at this or we're excellent at that.

25
00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:17.789
That becomes, I guess part of our belief system

26
00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.272
and our canvas starts looking like what they've told us we are.

27
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.586
<v ->Yes, like while still in you're little before</v>

28
00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:29.094
everything becomes as agreement.

29
00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:32.760
It's about to agree or disagree

30
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.220
and one is the way we are programmed

31
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.576
just to exist, just to be.

32
00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.875
And, the other is the interaction

33
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.660
that we have with the rest of the people.

34
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.639
Then every child will be a little different when we was born.

35
00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.131
The way we grow up will be also a little different.

36
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:56.485
Their children that they are very enthusiastic,

37
00:01:56.485 --> 00:02:00.044
others are very quiet but just by nature,

38
00:02:00.044 --> 00:02:03.309
just the way they was programmed to be.

39
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:08.454
But then, when knowledge is start to

40
00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:12.473
come in into our head,

41
00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:17.457
then it's the personality of the people who lives around us.

42
00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:19.944
<v ->And when you say knowledge, you're meaning the infomation</v>

43
00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:21.317
that's coming into us.
<v Don Miguel>Yes.</v>

44
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:22.026
<v ->Yes.</v>

45
00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:24.274
<v ->Well the information is really knowledge,</v>

46
00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:28.241
and knowledge, once again, it will be made

47
00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:32.782
by the symbols that we know then we are start hearing

48
00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:35.405
our parents talk to us and we just don't understand

49
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.981
what they say, until the brain is ready.

50
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.911
And the brain will be ready when

51
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.379
all really can deal with the rest of the body,

52
00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.600
when we finally walk, and start talking is when

53
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.576
we are reacting for the sounds, for the gesture,

54
00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:58.250
for the need to communicate because of desires

55
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.454
start coming out and the rejection also we want,

56
00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:04.778
we don't want is the basic choices,

57
00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:08.031
I want it, I don't want it, I want it, I don't want it.

58
00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:11.338
And all that depends on the physical body,

59
00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:15.771
but then the adults already have a way of life.

60
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:19.659
They already learn what they have to learn.

61
00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.667
They are active in the world.

62
00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:27.158
They have already a way of existing in society,

63
00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:30.965
interact with society in the same way is

64
00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.940
how they approach their own children,

65
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.287
And of course they want to hold their attention

66
00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:40.979
in order to share their knowledge with the children,

67
00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.702
then the attention is something that is extremely important

68
00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:49.065
because attention is part of the mind

69
00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:53.801
that help us to focus in what we want to perceive

70
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:57.587
and discriminate everything that we don't want to perceive,

71
00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:02.305
then we teach and we learn by focused attention.

72
00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:07.305
That attention is like a bridge who go from one brain

73
00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:10.097
to another or to one brain to many others,

74
00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:12.881
or from many others to one brain.

75
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.738
It is like a bridge that information comes and goes.

76
00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:23.495
Then our parents hook our attention and they make us repeat,

77
00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:27.050
and repeat and repeat, until we learn.

78
00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:31.707
Then, we start accumulating that information

79
00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:34.872
and we start using what we learned,

80
00:04:34.872 --> 00:04:38.760
trying to explain, try to ask for,

81
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.255
trying to reject it, etcetera,

82
00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:44.338
and get a little more complex, and a little more complex,

83
00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:46.428
but it's really an interaction

84
00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:51.288
when the brain becomes more mature, more mature,

85
00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:53.591
it's more ready to receive more information

86
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.997
and more information that when we are at like six years old,

87
00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:00.801
we are ready for elementary school.

88
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:04.779
The brain is ready to acquire all that information.

89
00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.702
<v ->But by then, you have a fully-developed sense through</v>

90
00:05:07.702 --> 00:05:11.393
other people serving as your mirror, as to what you are.

91
00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:13.773
<v ->Yes, this is how they teach us.</v>

92
00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:18.659
<v ->But that may not match how we feel inside.</v>

93
00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.006
<v ->But it match how we reflect it.</v>

94
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:22.904
They reflect it and we reflect it.

95
00:05:22.904 --> 00:05:26.094
<v ->We reflect back what we have agreed to.</v>

96
00:05:26.094 --> 00:05:27.481
<v ->We agree or disagree</v>

97
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.630
<v ->Even though we're very little, we've agreed or disagreed.</v>

98
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.542
<v ->The disadvantage is because we are very little.</v>

99
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.743
We cannot really defend ourself,

100
00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:40.635
then we are just waiting for whatever they say.

101
00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:45.033
Then it's the period of domestication, or learning,

102
00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:50.022
and we learn through punishment and reward.

103
00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:53.401
We talked a lot about that already,

104
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:55.471
and this is how we train the dogs,

105
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.444
the cats, and everybody else, well,

106
00:05:57.444 --> 00:06:01.464
we train our children exactly the same way

107
00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:04.456
with punishment, we reject them.

108
00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:12.437
Then usually it's fear is what

109
00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:16.930
make all this the whole process.

110
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.885
Fear to be rejected,

111
00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:24.767
fear not to be accepted,

112
00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:29.289
or fear to be punished or fear not to be rewarded.

113
00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.334
But it's really fear what has been

114
00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:33.577
used for centuries and centuries.

115
00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:37.640
Of course, it's been changing with the generations,

116
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.054
but it is still domestication and it's okay

117
00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:44.115
because you really want to domesticate your own children.

118
00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:48.744
You don't want that nobody else domesticate your children.

119
00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.154
And you are doing, according what you know,

120
00:06:51.154 --> 00:06:53.150
the best that you can do.

121
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.198
It's not to be a good parent or bad parent.

122
00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:57.139
No, you're doing always your best,

123
00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.072
and your best is what you learn from your parents,

124
00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:04.508
it's a whole chain, then if you don't domesticate your child

125
00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:09.198
somebody else will, and for sure you will not like that.

126
00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:13.683
<v ->And so still you have a child that is the product of</v>

127
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.171
your domestication, now, and so

128
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:20.978
they're now developing beliefs about themselves.

129
00:07:20.978 --> 00:07:23.667
<v ->And they create a whole picture, the whole canvas,</v>

130
00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:26.949
like you say, and according of

131
00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:30.138
how they deal with life is how

132
00:07:30.138 --> 00:07:32.396
they will see their own creation.

133
00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:35.414
<v ->And say there is someone who loves music,</v>

134
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:38.650
but maybe their little voice can't carry a tune.

135
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.755
But they love music and they see

136
00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:43.113
themselves as a musician inside,

137
00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:46.506
and then a parent or a brother or someone says,

138
00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:49.983
oh you can't even sing, you have a terrible voice.

139
00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:52.978
What happens to that little canvas then?

140
00:07:52.978 --> 00:07:57.022
<v ->Well, it's like a curse, mm-hmm.</v>

141
00:07:57.022 --> 00:08:01.362
If that person accept the comment,

142
00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:05.192
then that will act in as a curse, of course.

143
00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:07.397
<v ->Like a curse upon them.</v>

144
00:08:07.397 --> 00:08:10.918
<v ->But if doesn't agree,</v>

145
00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:14.958
then nothing will happen.

146
00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.014
<v ->And this is really critical because of the way</v>

147
00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:20.984
parents tend to raise their children.

148
00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:24.482
We do tend to project our ideas and our preferences,

149
00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:28.364
and what we know in our world, our, as you say,

150
00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:31.063
this is all an illusion that we've created anyway.

151
00:08:31.063 --> 00:08:33.100
It's a virtual reality, we're all walking around

152
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.033
in our own movies, and so we have our preferences.

153
00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:39.276
We've projected all this on our little child,

154
00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:42.230
and this really becomes the beginning of a journey

155
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.865
that has to, usually, is a long time in undoing.

156
00:08:45.865 --> 00:08:50.836
<v ->Yes and in many times, we do it without awareness.</v>

157
00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:53.711
You know like, you are very tired,

158
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.893
it's your ride home, and you hear older children screaming

159
00:08:57.893 --> 00:09:02.180
and doing things, and you just want peace.

160
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.525
You lose control and you can say

161
00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:07.779
some things you don't want to say,

162
00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:11.000
and they can take it as a curse.

163
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.770
<v ->They take it seriously, they embrace it</v>

164
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.824
and now there's some poison in them.

165
00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:19.754
And this becomes part of the picture.

166
00:09:19.754 --> 00:09:22.369
<v ->And it's not that you try to do anything,</v>

167
00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:27.366
you just love them, but it's nobody's fault really.

168
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:30.487
If we have a want that can change,

169
00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.502
it is like if the child take it personally,

170
00:09:33.502 --> 00:09:35.355
then it will be a curse,

171
00:09:35.355 --> 00:09:38.673
but if don't take it personally, nothing will happen.

172
00:09:38.705 --> 00:09:40.656
<v ->And that's really has to do,</v>

173
00:09:40.656 --> 00:09:42.311
and we'll get to that in a little bit,

174
00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:45.732
that has to do more with awareness on the parent's part,

175
00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:49.723
awareness on us as a species, as a society,

176
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:53.093
that we don't inflict that upon our children,

177
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.506
and allow them to start creating from an early age.

178
00:09:56.506 --> 00:09:58.541
<v ->Yes and this is the main reason</v>

179
00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.972
why I didn't want to teach children

180
00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:06.598
because children have parents.

181
00:10:06.598 --> 00:10:10.641
Then I prefer to teach the parents and the parents

182
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:14.822
modify their behavior, modify the way they believe,

183
00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:17.660
and that will affect the children.

184
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.611
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

185
00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:21.467
<v ->Then the children really need to learn more</v>

186
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:24.554
from the parents than from the teachers.

187
00:10:24.554 --> 00:10:26.623
<v ->And I think it's fair to say,</v>

188
00:10:26.623 --> 00:10:30.687
that there is definitely a waking-up happening,

189
00:10:30.687 --> 00:10:35.625
many people are starting to become more aware of their

190
00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:38.239
way they're thinking, their interaction with others,

191
00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:40.649
and their impact on others than probably

192
00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:44.340
ever more in history, and yet still,

193
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.217
a very large part of the population hasn't gotten

194
00:10:46.217 --> 00:10:48.588
to the point of thinking about these things yet.

195
00:10:48.588 --> 00:10:50.571
We're living in our own movie,

196
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:53.398
and you have a wonderful analogy in the book,

197
00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:57.579
and you and your son, José, wrote this, Don José,

198
00:10:57.579 --> 00:11:00.949
wrote this together, and if you wouldn't mind talking

199
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:02.389
about this one part, I love it,

200
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:04.730
because we can all imagine this,

201
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.302
and that is going to a mall, very, very large mall.

202
00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:09.691
It has thousands of movie theaters in it.

203
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:13.040
Tell us what happens in this scenario.

204
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.675
<v ->Yes, it's really my son José's</v>

205
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.308
bring this to the book, of course.

206
00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:21.167
And you know he have a great imagination

207
00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:24.505
and just to make it clear for people,

208
00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:28.334
he think about all those movie theaters

209
00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:33.005
and say well, if you go to that movie theater,

210
00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:36.857
and you see a movie that have your name,

211
00:11:36.857 --> 00:11:39.021
you get intrigued for that movie.

212
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:41.709
You go inside the movie and you find out that

213
00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:45.688
there's only one person watching the movie.

214
00:11:45.688 --> 00:11:48.418
And you sit behind the person and

215
00:11:48.418 --> 00:11:50.253
you just start watching the movie,

216
00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:53.272
you see that it's your story, it's--

217
00:11:53.272 --> 00:11:54.157
<v ->Your movie.</v>

218
00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:56.285
<v ->Yes, it's your movie, it's exactly</v>

219
00:11:56.285 --> 00:12:01.284
the way you see the world, and you find out, of course,

220
00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:05.237
that you are the producer, you are the director

221
00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:10.236
and you are the main actor or actress, and everybody else

222
00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:14.876
have just a secondary character, everybody else.

223
00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:16.317
<v ->And you're going to be presented</v>

224
00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:19.092
on your screen in the way you see yourself.

225
00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:21.419
<v ->And of course with everything you see the screen</v>

226
00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:24.453
for the first time you say, yes this is the way it is.

227
00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:29.448
But then you go out, and there's another movie,

228
00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:32.229
and you say, oh gosh this is the

229
00:12:32.229 --> 00:12:35.716
my mother's movie, it's the name of my mother.

230
00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:40.165
Then, you decide to go and you see her movie,

231
00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:42.693
you see a person watching the movie

232
00:12:42.693 --> 00:12:45.039
cause she is the mother, of course,

233
00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:48.730
and you see how she see the whole, the whole world,

234
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.113
how she see your father, how she see your brothers,

235
00:12:53.113 --> 00:12:56.707
how she sees you,

236
00:12:56.707 --> 00:13:01.063
and she sees herself.

237
00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:02.556
This is the big shock right away.

238
00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:05.586
Hey, what's going on here, this is not true.

239
00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:10.002
My father is not that way, my brothers are not that way.

240
00:13:10.002 --> 00:13:13.181
My mother's friends are not that way.

241
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:16.199
Even my mother is not that way, what she's talking about?

242
00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:19.453
<v ->And even you, you're saying I'm sure not like that.</v>

243
00:13:19.453 --> 00:13:24.421
<v ->This is not me, this is a big shock,</v>

244
00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:28.449
but you're seeing how your mother see her whole life,

245
00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:31.914
it's your mother's movie, and in that movie,

246
00:13:31.914 --> 00:13:34.400
you are just a secondary character.

247
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.464
And in that movie she really believe that she know you,

248
00:13:38.464 --> 00:13:41.547
that she knows you very well, and you say,

249
00:13:41.547 --> 00:13:45.423
there's no way, I'm not like that, this is not me.

250
00:13:46.731 --> 00:13:49.486
Then, you go out and you go to the next one,

251
00:13:49.486 --> 00:13:53.295
and it's your boyfriend or your husband,

252
00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:56.184
and you see how he see the whole movie,

253
00:13:56.184 --> 00:14:00.921
how he sees you, how he sees your children,

254
00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:03.993
how he sees your mother and your father,

255
00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:08.098
how he sees their parents, their friends,

256
00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.729
and okay that's really a big shock.

257
00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:17.406
How he sees you, this is really not me.

258
00:14:19.246 --> 00:14:23.975
How come, how dare, it's a big conflict,

259
00:14:24.675 --> 00:14:27.328
and you are just a secondary character

260
00:14:27.328 --> 00:14:30.640
because the whole story's your husband's story,

261
00:14:32.065 --> 00:14:34.565
then you go to your son's story,

262
00:14:36.406 --> 00:14:39.583
and of course you will see how he sees you,

263
00:14:39.583 --> 00:14:44.044
how he sees his father, his friends, his girlfriend,

264
00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:49.037
whatever, and the way he sees you.

265
00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:56.083
And of course, you have no idea how he's projecting himself,

266
00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.378
then the son that you think you knew is

267
00:14:58.378 --> 00:15:02.319
not that man that is in that movie at all.

268
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:05.184
Then, you go back to your own movie

269
00:15:05.184 --> 00:15:08.801
after seeing all those movies, and now you see your movie

270
00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:11.104
and you compare with the other movies,

271
00:15:11.104 --> 00:15:14.027
and you no longer believe

272
00:15:14.027 --> 00:15:18.048
that main character of your own movie.

273
00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:20.527
It's not you anymore.

274
00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:23.711
Then the person who was watching

275
00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:28.129
the movie turns the face and he's you.

276
00:15:30.818 --> 00:15:34.437
And that's an even bigger shock.

277
00:15:34.437 --> 00:15:35.186
<v ->Yes.</v>

278
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.611
<v ->Sounds like a The Twilight Zone.</v>

279
00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:40.162
<v ->It does, yes, and yet, this is</v>

280
00:15:40.162 --> 00:15:42.049
the truth of what's going on.

281
00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:45.903
There are almost seven billion of on this planet

282
00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:48.368
that each have our own movie, and

283
00:15:48.368 --> 00:15:50.639
we're the central character in our movie

284
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.793
with our perceptions that have been filtered

285
00:15:52.793 --> 00:15:55.173
and mirrored back through everybody else

286
00:15:55.173 --> 00:15:58.074
that we've interacted with to create this perception.

287
00:15:58.074 --> 00:16:03.068
And yet we're going around trying to please others,

288
00:16:03.068 --> 00:16:06.682
trying to be perfect, when--

289
00:16:06.682 --> 00:16:10.030
<v ->Be so careful what you project</v>

290
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.449
and you find out that your projection

291
00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:13.383
is already distorted in all those movies.

292
00:16:13.383 --> 00:16:15.473
It's not what you want to project.

293
00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:17.951
They perceive you the way they perceive you.

294
00:16:19.595 --> 00:16:22.330
<v ->I really like this analogy because it helps us</v>

295
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.350
understand the absolute futility

296
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.796
in trying to go around pleasing other people.

297
00:16:28.885 --> 00:16:33.885
<v ->Then when he wrote about this movies, the point is</v>

298
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.892
don't believe anybody, don't believe yourself,

299
00:16:38.892 --> 00:16:43.073
but learn to listen, this the fifth agreement, of course.

300
00:16:43.073 --> 00:16:46.423
Be skeptical but learn to listen.

301
00:16:46.428 --> 00:16:51.343
He put it in this movie theater

302
00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.842
to make it easy for people to understand why,

303
00:16:54.842 --> 00:16:57.230
and he say well don't believe me, don't believe yourself

304
00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.560
and don't believe anybody else, but learn to listen.

305
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.351
Then, when you after seeing all those movies

306
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:04.657
and you see your own movie again,

307
00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.046
how can you believe yourself anymore?

308
00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:08.624
<v ->Right, when you see how distorted</v>

309
00:17:08.624 --> 00:17:10.589
everything, every perception is.

310
00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:14.121
<v ->And then you see that you create a movie trying to</v>

311
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:18.722
to please everybody else and even try to please yourself.

312
00:17:18.722 --> 00:17:21.773
And all what you learned to create that movie

313
00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:24.237
is not accurate anymore, it doesn't work.

314
00:17:24.237 --> 00:17:25.677
<v ->No.</v>

315
00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:29.037
<v ->Then the fifth agreement is the end</v>

316
00:17:29.037 --> 00:17:31.639
of what we begins with the four agreements.

317
00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:33.495
The four agreements is the introduction

318
00:17:33.495 --> 00:17:35.842
as a life of an artist.

319
00:17:35.842 --> 00:17:39.436
The fifth agreement is the conclusion, okay, this is it.

320
00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:41.185
You practice the fifth agreement,

321
00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:43.713
you are no longer in war with yourself

322
00:17:43.713 --> 00:17:45.847
because when you watch your own movie again,

323
00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:48.982
after see everybody else's movie,

324
00:17:48.982 --> 00:17:53.735
you will find the futility to try

325
00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:56.220
to be okay with the rest of the movies,

326
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.384
then everything go in the right place.

327
00:17:58.384 --> 00:18:00.753
Why didn't pick up every bit of the word.

328
00:18:00.753 --> 00:18:03.163
Why not to take anything personally.

329
00:18:03.163 --> 00:18:08.092
Why not to make assumptions, and why to do always your best.

330
00:18:08.976 --> 00:18:10.488
<v ->The four agreements, yes.</v>

331
00:18:10.488 --> 00:18:15.488
<v ->When you learn to listen, that war inside you is over.</v>

332
00:18:16.752 --> 00:18:20.326
You have the peace of mind and you recover respect.

333
00:18:20.326 --> 00:18:23.908
And from that point, once you respect yourself,

334
00:18:23.908 --> 00:18:25.903
now you go to your father's or your mother's

335
00:18:25.903 --> 00:18:27.899
and you respect them, then you go to your husband's,

336
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.669
you respect it, you go to your children's,

337
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:31.471
you respect everybody else and

338
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:33.838
then you live in peace with everyone.

339
00:18:33.838 --> 00:18:37.262
<v ->Because if you haven't really considered and mastered the,</v>

340
00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:40.027
or even begun considering and working with

341
00:18:40.027 --> 00:18:41.765
the first four agreements, first of all

342
00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:43.255
you would see those other movies

343
00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.853
and you would start taking everything personally,

344
00:18:45.853 --> 00:18:48.540
and you'd think oh my God I can't believe they see me that,

345
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.090
I can't believe they see my sister that way.

346
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.042
And everything becomes very personal.

347
00:18:53.042 --> 00:18:55.574
The feelings are enflamed.

348
00:18:55.574 --> 00:18:57.030
<v ->And you make lots of assumptions.</v>

349
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.195
<v ->Lots of assumptions based on that,</v>

350
00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:02.885
and so where this book goes, in The Fifth Agreement,

351
00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:04.976
is really quite beautiful because then you look at it

352
00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:09.541
and say, is this true, is any of this true?

353
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:12.432
<v ->And that's the beginning of another way of life,</v>

354
00:19:12.432 --> 00:19:16.805
the way of life as a master, you are no longer a warrior,

355
00:19:16.805 --> 00:19:19.312
you are not in war anymore, you don't need to fight

356
00:19:19.312 --> 00:19:24.280
with anybody, neither with yourself or with anybody outside.

357
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.280
<v ->And just to go back one moment, one step in the book,</v>

358
00:19:29.282 --> 00:19:33.514
at first, you were just kind of living, you're just living.

359
00:19:33.514 --> 00:19:36.299
You're not really aware at all of what's going on,

360
00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:39.691
and I'd say probably the vast majority

361
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:41.099
of the world's population is not

362
00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:43.082
yet aware that they're in a movie.

363
00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:45.610
They're just reacting to everything around.

364
00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.402
The next step is you realize something's

365
00:19:47.402 --> 00:19:49.119
not right with your own movie,

366
00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:51.975
and you begin asking questions and you become the warrior.

367
00:19:51.975 --> 00:19:55.090
<v ->And yes, the four agreements really guide you to yourself.</v>

368
00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.009
<v ->Yes, and so now we're talking about</v>

369
00:19:57.009 --> 00:20:00.144
stepping beyond the warrior into the master.

370
00:20:00.144 --> 00:20:02.608
<v ->Yes and that's the fifth agreement.</v>

371
00:20:02.608 --> 00:20:04.349
It's like the four agreements is the introduction,

372
00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:07.414
let's say, to go to medical school.

373
00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:10.133
You go to medical school for four or five years,

374
00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:13.473
and in the end you have the final test.

375
00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:15.659
After that, now you are a medical doctor,

376
00:20:15.659 --> 00:20:19.094
you don't try to be a medical doctor, you are.

377
00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.205
And that's the fifth agreement.

378
00:20:21.205 --> 00:20:22.922
You practice the fifth agreement.

379
00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:26.410
You no longer try to be a master, you are a master.

380
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.587
<v ->And this is called the power of doubt.</v>

381
00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:29.984
<v ->Yes.</v>

382
00:20:29.984 --> 00:20:32.093
<v ->And when you first read that, the power of doubt?</v>

383
00:20:32.093 --> 00:20:34.162
Skepticism, I don't want to be a skeptic,

384
00:20:34.162 --> 00:20:37.479
I want to be open-minded, but talk about your definition.

385
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:40.050
<v ->That is exactly open-minded,</v>

386
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.992
once you go in to see all those movies and you see the truth

387
00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:51.040
then the doubt is over, mm-hmm.

388
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.983
But the power of the doubt first take you to your own movie.

389
00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:59.812
And see all what you learned by the projection to all those

390
00:20:59.812 --> 00:21:04.434
movies around you, teaching you to create your own movie.

391
00:21:05.622 --> 00:21:08.459
And by believe what they say, it becomes that,

392
00:21:08.459 --> 00:21:11.082
oh well I'm not good enough, I'm not beautiful enough,

393
00:21:11.082 --> 00:21:14.473
I'm not intelligent enough, why should I try?

394
00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.646
And you reject yourself before anybody else rejects you.

395
00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:21.343
With the power of touch, you challenge that.

396
00:21:21.343 --> 00:21:23.038
<v ->Because you've been doing this your whole life.</v>

397
00:21:23.038 --> 00:21:25.861
Once people effect you what you are and aren't,

398
00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:27.281
you've used those very symbols

399
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:31.462
to turn them against yourself, in terms of insecurity

400
00:21:31.462 --> 00:21:34.714
or even in the worst case, self-hatred.

401
00:21:34.714 --> 00:21:36.336
Which how many people are suffering

402
00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:39.289
from some degree of serious self-judgment?

403
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:42.360
<v ->Yes, becomes addicted to suffering.</v>

404
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.218
<v ->Yes.</v>

405
00:21:44.218 --> 00:21:46.369
<v ->And they don't feel good if they don't suffer.</v>

406
00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:48.374
<v ->Yeah and the Toltec way is not about suffering.</v>

407
00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:51.180
<v ->No, it's exactly the opposite.</v>

408
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.895
It's to live as an artist, appreciating the beauty.

409
00:21:56.225 --> 00:21:58.936
<v ->And when you come from this place where you can open,</v>

410
00:21:58.936 --> 00:22:03.936
with an open mind because you're now can look at everything

411
00:22:03.937 --> 00:22:06.397
with an acceptance and appreciation, I assume?

412
00:22:06.397 --> 00:22:09.161
Respect, as you say, in the book.

413
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.388
It doesn't matter what anybody else's life

414
00:22:11.388 --> 00:22:15.101
or canvas looks like, it's their artwork.

415
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:17.252
They've taken a lot of energy to create it.

416
00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:22.240
<v ->Exactly, and there's nothing to judge at all.</v>

417
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.218
Then, they have the right to speak,

418
00:22:26.218 --> 00:22:30.302
but you don't have to believe but if you listen

419
00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:34.520
you understand their movie, you know where they comin' from,

420
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:40.748
and if you want to you can give your help, if you want to

421
00:22:40.748 --> 00:22:44.013
and if they ask you, of course.

422
00:22:44.013 --> 00:22:45.249
If they don't ask you, you don't have

423
00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:47.496
the right to go and try to fix them.

424
00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:49.608
<v ->This is the big one because we all--</v>

425
00:22:49.608 --> 00:22:50.558
<v ->That's respect.</v>

426
00:22:50.558 --> 00:22:52.976
<v ->That's right and we don't realize I mean,</v>

427
00:22:52.976 --> 00:22:56.261
I tend to do that, I've done that a lot my whole life.

428
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:57.465
Someone will tell me their problems.

429
00:22:57.465 --> 00:22:59.466
I'll say, well how 'bout if-- you know,

430
00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:02.528
just kind of jump right in offering my big fat opinion.

431
00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:03.904
<v ->They're kind of asking you.</v>

432
00:23:03.904 --> 00:23:07.276
<v ->Yes, that's true, but I'm always kind of eager to say,</v>

433
00:23:07.276 --> 00:23:08.856
oh well have you read this book yet,

434
00:23:08.856 --> 00:23:11.715
or have you thought of that, and really,

435
00:23:11.715 --> 00:23:14.223
that's, as your book is pointing out,

436
00:23:14.223 --> 00:23:15.779
as this book points out, that's actually

437
00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:20.610
not being respectful of the other person, in a sense.

438
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.329
I'm not waiting for the invitation.

439
00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:26.472
I'm assuming that I have something that's going to help them

440
00:23:26.472 --> 00:23:29.513
and that's an assumption on my part.

441
00:23:29.513 --> 00:23:33.853
<v ->Well, that's not that easy to see that part.</v>

442
00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:38.296
You just came over to assist her, you can read it or not.

443
00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:42.222
<v ->But I mean many of us are parents, we're well-intentioned.</v>

444
00:23:42.222 --> 00:23:44.750
Oh don't do that you're going to end up with a cold,

445
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.192
or hurt yourself, or what-not,

446
00:23:46.192 --> 00:23:48.593
when the child's just exploring in a very natural way.

447
00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:52.442
We are trying to generally offer our loving help.

448
00:23:52.442 --> 00:23:55.791
<v ->Well with your children, you're following your instincts.</v>

449
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:57.347
You're following your program,

450
00:23:57.347 --> 00:24:01.234
and you want to protect them, even if they don't want to.

451
00:24:01.234 --> 00:24:02.873
<v ->And even our friends, if a friend is suffering,</v>

452
00:24:02.873 --> 00:24:05.029
you want to help them, the same instincts will kick in,

453
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:07.335
oh I'll help you with this, but I guess

454
00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:11.559
the point I'm making is to simply listen.

455
00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:13.926
You talk about quite a bit in the book,

456
00:24:13.926 --> 00:24:17.030
the art of listening is really the art of love,

457
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.439
offering your loving presence.

458
00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:21.947
<v ->And even if they ask you for help,</v>

459
00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:25.615
you have to make the decision if you want to help or not

460
00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:30.033
because many times it's better not to help.

461
00:24:30.033 --> 00:24:33.189
Many times, you know for example,

462
00:24:33.189 --> 00:24:36.655
one of your girlfriends have a fight

463
00:24:36.655 --> 00:24:40.837
with the husband and wanted to divorce,

464
00:24:40.837 --> 00:24:44.623
and it's so heart-breaking and she call,

465
00:24:44.623 --> 00:24:49.350
oh, look what happened to me, this man da-da-da-da.

466
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:54.257
And call all the girlfriends and say all the story,

467
00:24:55.116 --> 00:24:59.949
and the instant is to say oh that man da-da-da-da-da.

468
00:24:59.949 --> 00:25:03.623
Then, you find out that a week later,

469
00:25:03.623 --> 00:25:07.058
they get together again and nothing happened

470
00:25:07.058 --> 00:25:11.392
but you already have that feelings,

471
00:25:11.392 --> 00:25:14.739
and you bring something, she will defend the husband,

472
00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:19.359
and the friendship is over then many times

473
00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:23.449
it's better just not to be involved in those kind of things.

474
00:25:24.554 --> 00:25:26.720
Yes, they want to gossip about themself,

475
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.946
well, you don't need to participate in that gossip.

476
00:25:31.573 --> 00:25:34.036
<v ->Because the gossip often is about ourselves.</v>

477
00:25:34.036 --> 00:25:36.329
When you say gossip, you use it in a very,

478
00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:40.190
a much broader way that we communicate

479
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:45.190
we're messengers and the lowest level of messaging,

480
00:25:45.194 --> 00:25:48.364
of sending messages, is through gossip.

481
00:25:48.364 --> 00:25:50.896
But gossip is often, really,

482
00:25:50.896 --> 00:25:53.510
initiated by and aimed at ourselves.

483
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.621
<v ->Then, when she gossip about her husband, about herself,</v>

484
00:25:58.736 --> 00:26:02.666
she's spreading poison about her husband.

485
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:06.106
Then, when she get together with him,

486
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.602
now she want to defend the husband.

487
00:26:08.602 --> 00:26:11.152
And anyway, if we believe what she say,

488
00:26:11.152 --> 00:26:14.148
we only know the half of the story,

489
00:26:14.148 --> 00:26:16.358
and not even the half, just a little piece of the story

490
00:26:16.358 --> 00:26:19.119
because it's hiding so many other things,

491
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:22.436
why that happened, etcetera, and as you hear

492
00:26:22.436 --> 00:26:24.836
the story of the husband, you will hear something

493
00:26:24.836 --> 00:26:29.277
completely different, absolutely completely different.

494
00:26:30.377 --> 00:26:35.363
Then, to participate in somebody else's problems

495
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.908
is gonna lead you into

496
00:26:38.908 --> 00:26:41.595
break friendships, whatever.

497
00:26:41.595 --> 00:26:42.466
<v ->Yes, that's true.</v>

498
00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:43.974
<v ->Then, is that really necessary?</v>

499
00:26:43.974 --> 00:26:48.030
Then many times it's better to say, well I hear you,

500
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.221
I wish you the best you can, and if you guys get together

501
00:26:52.221 --> 00:26:56.892
then let's celebrate and if not then anyway.

502
00:26:56.892 --> 00:27:00.710
<v ->Yes, but instead the judge in us comes out,</v>

503
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.558
And we want to start looking at what we feel is just

504
00:27:03.558 --> 00:27:07.111
and fair in coming through our own lenses in all these

505
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:10.044
situations that are happening around us in life, and that

506
00:27:10.044 --> 00:27:14.385
really causes suffering for ourselves and for others.

507
00:27:14.385 --> 00:27:16.679
<v ->And breaks so many relationships around.</v>

508
00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:18.471
<v ->Yes, judgment.</v>

509
00:27:18.471 --> 00:27:21.713
<v ->Yeah, then it's better just, like when,</v>

510
00:27:21.713 --> 00:27:23.943
let's say with the fifth agreement,

511
00:27:23.943 --> 00:27:27.431
you have all this respect, you live in peace with everybody,

512
00:27:27.431 --> 00:27:31.143
but now you're wise, it's not about knowledge anymore.

513
00:27:31.143 --> 00:27:32.538
You become like a child again,

514
00:27:32.538 --> 00:27:35.190
and you're playing all the time.

515
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.671
<v ->And yet at the same time, as you are doing this,</v>

516
00:27:39.671 --> 00:27:42.647
as you say, you respect everybody else's story,

517
00:27:42.647 --> 00:27:47.223
everybody else's movie, life, their perceptions and so forth

518
00:27:47.223 --> 00:27:52.022
at the same time, that doesn't mean that you have to

519
00:27:52.022 --> 00:27:54.062
live in close proximity to some

520
00:27:54.062 --> 00:27:56.196
of the things that aren't compatible.

521
00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:58.191
<v ->Oh, definitely no, but you don't</v>

522
00:27:58.191 --> 00:27:59.753
need to have dinner with them.

523
00:27:59.753 --> 00:28:03.450
<v ->Yes, I mean someone may disrespect your story.</v>

524
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.378
<v ->Then, you are not there, you don't need to be there.</v>

525
00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:10.629
<v ->Right, acceptance doesn't mean</v>

526
00:28:10.629 --> 00:28:13.135
you have to take everything on board personally.

527
00:28:13.135 --> 00:28:17.339
And this is a line, especially, it seems more women

528
00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:19.643
even than men, but probably men too,

529
00:28:19.643 --> 00:28:22.581
kind of blur that line, you think oh no,

530
00:28:22.581 --> 00:28:25.138
I just want to accept everybody and love everybody

531
00:28:25.138 --> 00:28:28.487
for who they are and yet there are things that are causing

532
00:28:28.487 --> 00:28:30.696
direct pain to the individual,

533
00:28:30.696 --> 00:28:34.087
and this really requires some clarity.

534
00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:37.419
<v ->Awareness.</v>

535
00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:40.632
You recall all those four agreements,

536
00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:43.262
before even try the fifth agreement.

537
00:28:43.262 --> 00:28:48.247
<v ->Now, if you are living as best you can within</v>

538
00:28:48.247 --> 00:28:51.548
these four agreements, and you are doing your best,

539
00:28:51.548 --> 00:28:55.035
first of all, doing your best doesn't mean you're perfect,

540
00:28:55.035 --> 00:28:59.354
right, doing your best is the best you can in the moment.

541
00:28:59.354 --> 00:29:01.807
<v ->The truth is that everyone is perfect.</v>

542
00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:06.107
<v ->Yes, well, that's true, I know you.</v>

543
00:29:06.107 --> 00:29:09.901
Okay, let me rephrase that, your best

544
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:12.438
in one moment, may look very different than

545
00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:13.880
doing your very best in another moment.

546
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.441
<v ->Oh, it change all the time.</v>

547
00:29:15.441 --> 00:29:17.211
<v ->I'm just saying you're not looking for</v>

548
00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:20.433
any kind of outside criteria on this.

549
00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:24.079
<v ->Well, you know, for the agreement number four,</v>

550
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:28.671
do your best, it's the action.

551
00:29:28.671 --> 00:29:30.496
I'm traveling all around the world.

552
00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:33.838
I see all these different cities, sights,

553
00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:36.995
all these miracles that happen in science,

554
00:29:36.995 --> 00:29:41.477
the beauty of everything, and everything exists first

555
00:29:41.477 --> 00:29:46.477
in the human mind, but action is what make it possible,

556
00:29:46.478 --> 00:29:50.417
what make it real, you see freeways,

557
00:29:50.417 --> 00:29:52.807
well, first exist in the human mind

558
00:29:52.807 --> 00:29:55.525
and with action, there becomes freeways.

559
00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:58.778
You see spaceships, first exist in the human mind,

560
00:29:58.778 --> 00:30:01.999
and everything created by man first exists

561
00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:06.798
in the human mind, and with the action, we make it real.

562
00:30:06.798 --> 00:30:08.989
We have the dream

563
00:30:08.989 --> 00:30:13.008
and with the action, we make it come true.

564
00:30:13.008 --> 00:30:14.661
<v ->And that would be the fourth agreement because</v>

565
00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:17.138
it's following the other's of being impeccable

566
00:30:17.138 --> 00:30:20.004
with your word, not making assumptions, and so forth.

567
00:30:20.004 --> 00:30:22.511
<v ->This other tree is just the preparation</v>

568
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:26.587
is to have the dream but now the interaction

569
00:30:26.587 --> 00:30:31.215
is always do your best is the action.

570
00:30:31.215 --> 00:30:33.625
<v ->And so, let's say, we're taking that onboard,</v>

571
00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:35.694
and we're really working with this,

572
00:30:35.694 --> 00:30:39.918
and we're really starting to see the illusion,

573
00:30:39.918 --> 00:30:42.606
and the illusion in all of it, the illusion in our own story

574
00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:45.977
and everybody else's, and we're embracing it.

575
00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:50.905
And yet, say we have people in our lives whose own stories

576
00:30:50.905 --> 00:30:55.684
are intruding into ours and making life very painful for us.

577
00:30:55.684 --> 00:30:59.672
How do you go about a situation like that?

578
00:30:59.672 --> 00:31:02.385
<v ->Well, as the same like us,</v>

579
00:31:02.385 --> 00:31:06.565
they also have the word.

580
00:31:06.565 --> 00:31:09.169
They take this personally, they make assumptions,

581
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:12.927
and it's many people around us doing the same thing.

582
00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:17.220
And they want to be right, and they

583
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.730
try to make everybody else wrong.

584
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.980
It doesn't mean they are right.

585
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.006
It doesn't mean they are wrong.

586
00:31:25.006 --> 00:31:29.016
This is just what happen in their world, in their reality.

587
00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:32.430
<v ->And their reality is now interacting with your reality.</v>

588
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.145
<v ->Then this is where</v>

589
00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:38.184
you become responsible for

590
00:31:38.184 --> 00:31:43.037
your creation, for your reality but not for anybody else's.

591
00:31:43.037 --> 00:31:46.226
Then, if they want to write in your book of paintings,

592
00:31:46.226 --> 00:31:50.915
your canvas, that's where you have to put a limit, okay,

593
00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:56.551
you can write in yours but don't come in mine.

594
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:59.837
And of course you can say, okay come in write in mine,

595
00:31:59.837 --> 00:32:03.325
but you will pay consequences for that.

596
00:32:03.325 --> 00:32:07.473
Because you're responsible for yours unless you allow them

597
00:32:07.473 --> 00:32:12.461
to invade yours and to take decisions for you

598
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:15.762
and to tell you what to do and what not to do.

599
00:32:15.762 --> 00:32:20.085
You are losing your will in many ways.

600
00:32:20.085 --> 00:32:25.085
And it still is your dream, it's your reality

601
00:32:25.092 --> 00:32:29.293
and you're still responsible for that reality.

602
00:32:29.293 --> 00:32:30.747
<v ->You don't want to let somebody else come</v>

603
00:32:30.747 --> 00:32:34.510
and put some poo on your canvas.

604
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.779
<v ->Exactly, even if they say okay,</v>

605
00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:43.209
if you love me, you can take all my garbage.

606
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.287
<v ->No, that's not respecting the self then.</v>

607
00:32:47.287 --> 00:32:51.331
<v ->That is you go 'round, that's what they're doing.</v>

608
00:32:51.331 --> 00:32:52.535
<v ->And I think everybody watching</v>

609
00:32:52.535 --> 00:32:56.069
this certainly knows this and feels it.

610
00:32:56.069 --> 00:32:58.893
<v ->And then they have all the garbage from the other person,</v>

611
00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:01.560
they complain for that when they accept it.

612
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.268
<v ->And then you put garbage on someone else's canvas.</v>

613
00:33:05.268 --> 00:33:10.268
So this self-responsibility is the place where we have to

614
00:33:10.273 --> 00:33:13.698
say I will and will not accept this into my own life.

615
00:33:13.698 --> 00:33:17.089
<v ->And all that depends how much you love yourself.</v>

616
00:33:17.089 --> 00:33:17.995
<v ->Yes.</v>

617
00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:21.362
<v ->It's the whole thing becomes again about love.</v>

618
00:33:21.362 --> 00:33:24.305
If you love yourself so much, you will not accept

619
00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:28.619
that nobody put anything in you.

620
00:33:30.396 --> 00:33:33.363
<v ->And I, from being around you, you have such a,</v>

621
00:33:33.363 --> 00:33:38.003
you're such a kind and loving, soft presence

622
00:33:38.003 --> 00:33:41.171
to be around, and yet at the same time,

623
00:33:41.171 --> 00:33:44.958
you have delineated what you will

624
00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:46.397
and will not accept in your life.

625
00:33:46.397 --> 00:33:48.050
<v ->Oh, definitely.</v>

626
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.856
<v ->And I assume you do this in a very loving way.</v>

627
00:33:50.856 --> 00:33:55.848
<v ->Well, I love to be happy, I love to enjoy life.</v>

628
00:33:55.848 --> 00:33:59.452
I create my own heaven, and I will not accept

629
00:33:59.452 --> 00:34:02.658
that anybody come and disrupt my heaven.

630
00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:07.473
But I'm completely open, that make me so strong

631
00:34:07.473 --> 00:34:11.046
and heaven is very contagious.

632
00:34:11.046 --> 00:34:14.812
Because people love to be around me.

633
00:34:14.812 --> 00:34:17.894
You go on the street, you have that beautiful smile.

634
00:34:17.894 --> 00:34:21.126
People love to be around you, you are enjoying life,

635
00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:25.029
people love to be around you, but if that people

636
00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:27.579
want to tell you, okay, it's not okay

637
00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:31.013
for you to smile all the time.

638
00:34:31.013 --> 00:34:34.961
Okay, something's wrong if you accept that.

639
00:34:34.961 --> 00:34:38.331
<v ->Yes.</v>

640
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:41.605
And so now, we come to, there's this one,

641
00:34:41.605 --> 00:34:45.732
there are a few things there, and this is what

642
00:34:45.732 --> 00:34:48.175
it feeds into what you were just saying,

643
00:34:48.175 --> 00:34:50.405
and it comes to a place in our life

644
00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:53.914
where we reach the last judgment.

645
00:34:53.914 --> 00:34:56.142
I love that term, and that's actually,

646
00:34:56.142 --> 00:34:59.044
as you write in the book, that is a tarot card,

647
00:34:59.044 --> 00:35:01.752
which is out of the Egyptian traditions.

648
00:35:01.752 --> 00:35:05.048
Let's talk about what the last judgment really means

649
00:35:05.048 --> 00:35:07.430
in terms of setting ourselves free.

650
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:12.228
<v ->Well, this is in every mystery school, not just Egyptian,</v>

651
00:35:14.518 --> 00:35:18.994
and mystery school is also elementary school.

652
00:35:18.994 --> 00:35:20.093
<v ->Elementary school, yes.</v>

653
00:35:20.093 --> 00:35:22.635
<v ->Any school is a mystery school.</v>

654
00:35:22.635 --> 00:35:26.271
We just don't see it that way.

655
00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:30.922
But, the last judgment is the very, you know,

656
00:35:30.922 --> 00:35:35.289
the last part of any mystery school is the end of the world.

657
00:35:36.149 --> 00:35:40.728
That's the last judgment, the end of the world.

658
00:35:40.728 --> 00:35:42.921
I'm not talking about the planet.

659
00:35:42.921 --> 00:35:47.241
I'm talking about the world that we create, our world.

660
00:35:47.241 --> 00:35:49.940
Your whole creations, your whole canvas.

661
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.166
You used to believe in certain way,

662
00:35:53.166 --> 00:35:54.942
and the rules was about judgment.

663
00:35:54.942 --> 00:35:57.192
Other people's judgment, you judge other people,

664
00:35:57.192 --> 00:36:00.489
you judge yourself, well the last judgment's

665
00:36:00.489 --> 00:36:03.666
come with the fifth agreement.

666
00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:06.491
Be skeptical but learn to listen.

667
00:36:07.842 --> 00:36:10.423
Once, that you practice, and you must

668
00:36:10.423 --> 00:36:14.565
with the fifth agreement, there's no more judgments.

669
00:36:15.296 --> 00:36:19.797
You don't judge yourself and even the whole world judge you.

670
00:36:19.797 --> 00:36:23.937
You don't agree with those judgments.

671
00:36:23.937 --> 00:36:26.785
Just imagine Buddha sitting in the body tree,

672
00:36:26.785 --> 00:36:31.776
with all the armies trained their arrows against Buddha,

673
00:36:31.776 --> 00:36:35.237
but when the arrows arrive, they are roses.

674
00:36:35.264 --> 00:36:39.487
He leave already his own heaven.

675
00:36:39.487 --> 00:36:43.764
Then, the last judgment is the end of that world.

676
00:36:43.764 --> 00:36:47.566
And the last judgment is about you,

677
00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:51.743
the last time that you'll judge yourself.

678
00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:53.694
After that, there's no more judgments.

679
00:36:53.694 --> 00:36:57.357
Then, you become the master, it's just wisdom.

680
00:36:57.896 --> 00:37:00.746
You don't believe everything you learned.

681
00:37:00.746 --> 00:37:04.778
It's just knowledge and didn't exist before.

682
00:37:04.778 --> 00:37:08.265
It's our creation, and with knowledge,

683
00:37:08.265 --> 00:37:13.176
we use it for communication but it's under us,

684
00:37:13.949 --> 00:37:15.806
and we can change the meaning of knowledge

685
00:37:15.806 --> 00:37:20.499
every time we want to, according when we want to communicate

686
00:37:22.029 --> 00:37:25.319
and we usually communicate with words, with numbers,

687
00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:29.061
with music, etcetera,

688
00:37:29.061 --> 00:37:32.164
but what we really, our real message

689
00:37:32.164 --> 00:37:36.424
is just our own existence, just being what we are.

690
00:37:39.688 --> 00:37:42.201
That's what is real, what is truth.

691
00:37:42.201 --> 00:37:43.993
<v ->That's when you're free.
[Don Miguel] Yes.

692
00:37:43.993 --> 00:37:47.032
<v ->And that's when you're living heaven.</v>

693
00:37:48.402 --> 00:37:51.314
<v ->Then is the beginning of a new world.</v>

694
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:57.826
It doesn't need to be described by words anymore,

695
00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:03.047
but anyway we do it just to share with others,

696
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.576
but we don't even believe our own words

697
00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.971
because they are so limited, you know like,

698
00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:14.608
if you want to describe a tree,

699
00:38:17.356 --> 00:38:19.916
you will describe it with words and you can write

700
00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:23.948
several volumes describing every single leaf,

701
00:38:23.948 --> 00:38:27.178
every single piece of that tree, and looks different

702
00:38:27.178 --> 00:38:30.102
according to the time of the day.

703
00:38:30.102 --> 00:38:34.137
And it's different according the time of the year.

704
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:39.833
But if you see the tree, you don't need words.

705
00:38:40.021 --> 00:38:41.504
<v ->You can experience it instantly.</v>

706
00:38:41.504 --> 00:38:44.570
<v ->Exactly, you don't need words to explain it.</v>

707
00:38:44.597 --> 00:38:48.724
<v ->That's very true, and this comes down to the being part</v>

708
00:38:48.724 --> 00:38:51.528
and there's a passage in the book,

709
00:38:51.528 --> 00:38:54.868
or a paragraph in the book in which,

710
00:38:54.868 --> 00:38:59.327
it says that Popeye the Sailor Man was my hero

711
00:38:59.327 --> 00:39:00.244
(laughing)

712
00:39:00.244 --> 00:39:03.045
because he said, and it was really quite profound,

713
00:39:03.045 --> 00:39:06.362
and I remember that as a kid, I am that I am, and that's all

714
00:39:06.362 --> 00:39:10.543
that I am, and you're saying that's the ultimate truth.

715
00:39:10.543 --> 00:39:13.480
<v ->Yes, because I really don't know what I am.</v>

716
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.436
I have no idea, and nobody else have an idea what they are.

717
00:39:20.376 --> 00:39:24.600
Not even dogs or cats, we call them dogs, we call them cats,

718
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.363
but they don't know, they don't care to know.

719
00:39:27.363 --> 00:39:30.023
They are just what they are.

720
00:39:31.447 --> 00:39:35.133
Then I call myself human, just by agreement.

721
00:39:36.621 --> 00:39:41.126
I can use more words to describe myself, to say I'm a human.

722
00:39:41.495 --> 00:39:46.495
I'm a doctor, I'm an author, I'm a soul, I'm a spirit,

723
00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:53.148
I'm light, I'm energy, they're just words.

724
00:39:54.103 --> 00:39:56.305
The truth is that I don't know.

725
00:39:57.655 --> 00:40:02.000
<v ->So this is the journey of knowing thyself.</v>

726
00:40:03.094 --> 00:40:04.341
<v ->What you are.</v>

727
00:40:04.341 --> 00:40:05.528
<v ->You just are.</v>

728
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:07.258
<v ->You don't need to know yourself, you are.</v>

729
00:40:07.258 --> 00:40:09.937
<v ->You already are a feeling maybe experiencing</v>

730
00:40:09.937 --> 00:40:12.817
or feeling, your essence, yes.

731
00:40:12.817 --> 00:40:17.548
<v ->Be alive, enjoy life, do what you love to do.</v>

732
00:40:20.497 --> 00:40:23.424
And passion in what you do.

733
00:40:24.891 --> 00:40:27.025
<v ->And when things come along inevitably</v>

734
00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:30.300
that you need to deal with, a challenge here and there.

735
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.369
<v ->Well, you'll face it.</v>

736
00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:36.682
As soon as you face it, sooner you're happier again.

737
00:40:36.923 --> 00:40:41.349
<v ->Yes as you say, the most critical part</v>

738
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:45.924
of a real-life drama or a novel or a movie,

739
00:40:45.924 --> 00:40:50.924
the ultimate point in that is when truth is discovered.

740
00:40:51.705 --> 00:40:56.026
<v ->The moment of the truth, the whole world collapse.</v>

741
00:40:57.626 --> 00:40:59.827
<v ->That's a powerful message.</v>

742
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
Oh, Miguel, we're almost out of time.

743
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
We just have a couple minutes left,

744
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
is there any final thing that you'd like to share with us

745
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
that we haven't gotten to yet?

746
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->Well, just to everybody remember that</v>

747
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
we all come with one mission, and

748
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
it's the mission is the same for everyone,

749
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
and that mission is just to enjoy life, to be happy.

750
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
What is different is the how, there's six billion

751
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
ways of how, every one for every single human.

752
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
If they just remember that, they don't need

753
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
to look for happiness outside, it's inside of them,

754
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
and it's just by being what they are.

755
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->On that note, thank you so much for taking the time.</v>

756
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->You're very welcome, very welcome.</v>

757
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->This worked out perfectly, you're only a few miles</v>

758
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
from our house because we're here

759
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
in your son's house, you're babysitting for a few days.

760
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->Yes, I have two beautiful children.</v>

761
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->On that note, it turned out to be very convenient</v>

762
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
'cause I've wanted to meet you for at least 15 years

763
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
since your book came out, so thank you so much again.

764
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->Oh, you're very welcome, it's my pleasure,</v>

765
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
and God bless you.

766
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
<v ->I've read all of Don Miguel's works as they've come out</v>

767
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
over the years, and I will reiterate

768
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
the concepts contained within the pages are profound

769
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
if we're willing to look at our life in fresh ways.

770
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
The Fifth Agreement quickly recaps the previous

771
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
four agreements and extends the information

772
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
into the power of doubt in a powerful way.

773
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
You can find the book through any major bookseller.

774
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

775
23:59:59.999 --> 23:59:59.999
(reflective music)
