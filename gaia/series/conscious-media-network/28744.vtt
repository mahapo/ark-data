1
00:00:00.842 --> 00:00:03.263
<v ->Terri Daniel went through what every parent fears,</v>

2
00:00:03.263 --> 00:00:04.927
the loss of her child.

3
00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:07.018
Her son Danny was dying from a degenerative

4
00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:09.065
metabolic disorder just as Terri

5
00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:11.529
was opening her intuitive abilities.

6
00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.289
Terri found that her bond with Danny

7
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.785
exceeded the normal intuitive bond

8
00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:19.249
between mother and child when Danny finally passed over.

9
00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.543
From the other side, he began to

10
00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:23.217
teach her about family relationships.

11
00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:29.542 line:15% 
(soothing piano music)

12
00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:35.676
<v Regina>You had a very challenging journey</v>

13
00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:38.064
at one point a few years ago and for several years

14
00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:41.893
prior to that because your son was seriously degenerating

15
00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:45.168
right before your eyes and died at a very tender age

16
00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:47.963
and you weren't even able to communicate with him

17
00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:50.669
at the time of his death and those few years prior

18
00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:53.549
as I understand it, but something happened

19
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.223
once he passed to the other side

20
00:00:55.223 --> 00:00:57.943
and while he was in the degenerative process

21
00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:00.703
to you, can you talk about what happened to your own

22
00:01:00.703 --> 00:01:04.115
intuitive abilities and what was going on with your son

23
00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:06.398
during these final years of his life?

24
00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:10.000
<v ->I was always somewhat intuitive, I was always interested</v>

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.699
in spiritual work and metaphysical study,

26
00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:17.095
but when he was about three years out before he died

27
00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:19.637
he started to lose the ability to speak.

28
00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:22.101
He has a progressively degenerative disease,

29
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:25.045
and as he started losing the ability to speak,

30
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:29.226
I started gaining the ability to hear telepathically.

31
00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:32.244
We got to a point where we could communicate that way

32
00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:35.145
as any mother can with a nonverbal child,

33
00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.396
you can communicate with your infant,

34
00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.486
and it kind of went back to that,

35
00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:41.972
but there was a lot more going on.

36
00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:44.894
At the time I was working as a tarot card reader

37
00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:47.689
at a metaphysical bookstore, and I met a woman

38
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.334
who was my mentor, Judy, who said,

39
00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:52.424
"You know when you do these readings,

40
00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.739
"you can channel while you're doing them."

41
00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.576
I thought, "Oh... okay."

42
00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:00.938
She showed me some exercises and some processes

43
00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:03.129
to open a conduit and begin channeling.

44
00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.425
I started bringing in guides and teachers

45
00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:10.585
in dreams and meditations in my tarot reading

46
00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:15.139
and remarkably I found that I could start communicating

47
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.298
with my son that way as well.

48
00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:18.921
<v Regina>And this is when he was still alive?</v>

49
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:20.947
<v ->Yes, it was three years before he died.</v>

50
00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:24.414
This whole group of teachers and guardians

51
00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:27.656
came and wrapped themselves around us

52
00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:31.208
and led us to the next steps.

53
00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.629
Of course they were waiting all along

54
00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.371
I just had to open the conduit to hear them.

55
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:38.688
<v Regina>And what were the next steps?</v>

56
00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:42.182
The next steps were I began to teach my son

57
00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.595
to meditate and also teach him different views of death.

58
00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:48.272
I realized that children in America, their only

59
00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:51.941
idea of death is what they see on TV and the movies.

60
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:53.876
<v Regina>And you knew at this time he was going to die?</v>

61
00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:55.955
<v ->I knew when he was 10 that he was going to die</v>

62
00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:58.514
and at this point he was now 12 or 13.

63
00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:01.832
So I thought, okay I'm going to have to talk to him

64
00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:03.981
about this, I'm going to have to explain it to him.

65
00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:06.047
We never had any relatives who died,

66
00:03:06.047 --> 00:03:08.607
we never had a dog who died, so he knew nothing

67
00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:13.607
except video games and movies. Violence, rage.

68
00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:17.416
The first thing, the next step was to give him

69
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.089
a different view of death.

70
00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.126
I started getting books from the library and

71
00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:23.196
websites with Native American views

72
00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:25.467
and Buddhist views and teaching it to him

73
00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:29.211
and reading him stories and also imparting

74
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:33.734
my existing beliefs about reincarnation and the afterlife

75
00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:38.734
and teaching him when you die, it's gonna be like

76
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:42.885
you just go to sleep and then you wake up in another world,

77
00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:45.744
but in this world, your body is perfect,

78
00:03:45.744 --> 00:03:48.133
you feel absolute joy, and guess what?

79
00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:52.171
I will still be there with you, and you'll say,

80
00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:56.307
"Wow, I'm gone, but I'm not gone, I'm here even more."

81
00:03:56.307 --> 00:03:59.272
With that I started giving him guided meditations

82
00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.224
and teaching him all of this because I wanted him

83
00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:05.120
to have a happy death, I didn't want him to be afraid.

84
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.386
<v Regina>You were communicating, by this time,</v>

85
00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:11.237
telepathically with him in terms of your hearing,

86
00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:13.541
but in terms of your verbalization

87
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:15.994
of these various traditions and stories

88
00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:18.458
that you had just mentioned, were you getting

89
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:22.319
validation from him that he was really understanding

90
00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.700
and embracing this information and interested in it?

91
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.652
<v ->That's a really good question because</v>

92
00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:31.064
he couldn't say to me, "This is cool" or "Yes I get this"

93
00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.984
but yes, I was and I was getting that validation

94
00:04:33.984 --> 00:04:36.192
emotionally and telepathically.

95
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.997
When I would do a guided meditation with him

96
00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:41.248
he couldn't keep his eyes closed because

97
00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:44.021
neurologically he was having seizures all the time

98
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:45.523
so I would say, "Okay close your eyes"

99
00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:48.291
and he would go like this and he would open them again.

100
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:49.109
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:50.045
(both laugh)

102
00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:52.485
<v ->But he was trying to close his eyes,</v>

103
00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:55.920
so I knew he was listening and he'd be smiling

104
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.121
and he would just be in this blissful space

105
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:02.274
and I could feel it, and I could feel his soul

106
00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:05.824
and I would have dreams, or I'd fall asleep next to him

107
00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:09.108
and I'd have these incredible visions and dreams

108
00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:13.566
of his soul and my soul dancing over mountaintops

109
00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:17.138
with bells ringing in the background, just amazing stuff.

110
00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:19.791
So I knew he was getting in.

111
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.990
[Regina] So by the time he had lost his ability to speak

112
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.502
he was still very young, like you said

113
00:05:25.502 --> 00:05:28.478
by the age of 11 or 12 he was having difficulty?

114
00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.888
<v ->He started having difficulty about 11</v>

115
00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:34.227
and by 13 or 14 he couldn't really talk at all.

116
00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:35.923
<v Regina>So he never reached an age where</v>

117
00:05:35.923 --> 00:05:37.905
he would have been able to articulate

118
00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.177
the kind of things that happened then

119
00:05:40.177 --> 00:05:43.452
once he made his transition into the other world, right?

120
00:05:43.452 --> 00:05:45.798
<v ->Yes and that's a problem for me.</v>

121
00:05:45.798 --> 00:05:47.772
That's one of the things I still struggle with,

122
00:05:47.772 --> 00:05:50.907
with guilt because all bereaved parents have guilt,

123
00:05:50.907 --> 00:05:53.574
and I wish that I had started talking to him about this

124
00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:56.016
when he was still able to talk.

125
00:05:56.016 --> 00:05:57.844
He was diagnosed when he was 10.

126
00:05:57.844 --> 00:05:59.022
<v Regina>What did he have again?</v>

127
00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:01.530
<v ->It was called metachromatic leukodystrophy.</v>

128
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.054
It's a very rare disease, one in 80,000 births,

129
00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:10.028
and it takes an exact genetic lineup between parents

130
00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:13.438
for it to happen, it was hereditary and he was adopted.

131
00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:16.062
<v Regina>It's a metabolic disorder, it's a degenerative</v>

132
00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:17.853
metabolic disorder, is it not?

133
00:06:17.853 --> 00:06:21.245
<v ->Sort of, it's a myelin demyelination,</v>

134
00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:24.604
the myelin sheath of the brain disappears kind of disorder.

135
00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:25.927
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

136
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:29.178
<v ->I always thought, I wish I had started talking to him</v>

137
00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:31.268
about this when he was 10, because then

138
00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:33.401
he could tell me what he thought about death.

139
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:35.844
But when he was 10, I wasn't ready to tell him,

140
00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:38.137
"You're gonna die" because I didn't want him

141
00:06:38.137 --> 00:06:40.526
to worry about it, so I didn't really

142
00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:44.056
start telling him that until he was 12 and 13.

143
00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:46.657
By that time he couldn't respond verbally

144
00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:48.726
to me so that's something I regret.

145
00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:52.001
When I work with parents now of severely disabled

146
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:54.273
children with life threatening diseases, I always

147
00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:57.962
tell them, "Talk about this while they can still talk."

148
00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:00.799
But most of the parents say, "Oh no, I can't."

149
00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:02.772
Same reason I couldn't.

150
00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:06.463
<v Regina>I understand. Yes. Let's move into the time</v>

151
00:07:06.463 --> 00:07:09.919
where he did make his transition from this world to the next

152
00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.873
and then what started happening.

153
00:07:12.873 --> 00:07:17.308
<v ->Well it turns out that all the training I did</v>

154
00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:20.027
for both of us, which it turns out it was,

155
00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:23.912
all those meditations and conversations and the dreams,

156
00:07:23.912 --> 00:07:27.769
I would sleep by his side and we would journey together.

157
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:31.599
30 minutes after he died, I was holding his body

158
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.339
in my arms and I said, "Where are you?

159
00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.291
"can you show me where you are?"

160
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:38.594
and he sent me this ridiculous vision.

161
00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:40.546
It was a picture of him standing in about

162
00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:43.789
two inches of water, kicking his feet and laughing

163
00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:46.466
and he's wearing a t-shirt with rolled up sleeves

164
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.717
and pants with rolled up cuffs

165
00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:50.862
and he looked like James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause

166
00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:51.862
(Regina laughs)

167
00:07:51.862 --> 00:07:54.370
and I laughed my head off, I just thought that was so funny

168
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.906
and I said, "Why are you showing me this?"

169
00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:57.782
and he said, "Because I want you to laugh.

170
00:07:57.782 --> 00:08:01.643
"I want you to see how much fun this is."

171
00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:03.286
<v Regina>And you were hearing him?</v>

172
00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:05.056
<v ->I was totally hearing him, and this was</v>

173
00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:07.792
30 minutes after he died, but the hearing

174
00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:10.001
isn't like you're hearing me right now.

175
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:15.001
It's not sound in your ears. It's thoughts in your head.

176
00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:18.890
They were so clear and so articulate

177
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.672
and he was very articulate when he could talk,

178
00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:23.763
and he turned out to be extremely articulate

179
00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:27.585
on the other side as well and he said,

180
00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:30.522
"Well here we are. We've planned this.

181
00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:35.470
"We worked on this, now the fun and games can begin.

182
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.838
"This is what we're really here to do,

183
00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:40.280
"so let's get started. We've got work to do."

184
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.433
<v Regina>Let's talk about where the work began.</v>

185
00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:44.133
(both laugh)

186
00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:45.900
<v ->In the beginning I started seeing him</v>

187
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.548
and hearing him all the time and he introduced me

188
00:08:49.548 --> 00:08:52.364
to somebody else that he was with on the other side,

189
00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:54.564
a man that I first saw...

190
00:08:54.564 --> 00:08:58.104
well he showed me this vineyard,

191
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.877
this sun-drenched beautiful yellow light

192
00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:05.877
Italian vineyard and in a tree

193
00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:09.864
was this man who was working, picking fruit or something,

194
00:09:09.864 --> 00:09:13.480
and it was one of my guides, somebody named Arlin.

195
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.880
Danny started introducing me to all of these people.

196
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.152
It had now gotten to the point where I was

197
00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:20.100
getting these huge visuals and these magnificent stories

198
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.766
from him and I would write them all down in my journal.

199
00:09:23.766 --> 00:09:26.218
So he introduced me to Arlin and a bunch of other people

200
00:09:26.218 --> 00:09:28.136
who were with him, and he started teaching me

201
00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:32.222
about soul families, and how incarnations are planned,

202
00:09:32.222 --> 00:09:34.152
"All the people here right now

203
00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:35.688
are members of our soul family.

204
00:09:35.688 --> 00:09:38.152
"Some of us are incarnated together now

205
00:09:38.152 --> 00:09:40.488
"or at other times, we sort of pop in and out,

206
00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:43.112
"and in-between incarnations we sit

207
00:09:43.112 --> 00:09:45.767
"and we have these conferences,"

208
00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:47.527
this is how he put it, and he showed me

209
00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:49.435
a beautiful little stone cottage in the middle

210
00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:51.451
of this vineyard with a big table

211
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:53.521
and everybody's sitting around the table.

212
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:55.717
I'm not saying that's the way it always happens

213
00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:59.044
but he showed it to me in a way that I would understand,

214
00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:00.015
<v Regina>Right.</v>

215
00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:01.574
<v ->which is how they communicate with us.</v>

216
00:10:01.574 --> 00:10:03.523
They'll give us whatever vision works for us.

217
00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:06.584
If we want to see Jesus and Saint Peter

218
00:10:06.584 --> 00:10:10.009
and pearly gates, this is what we'll see.

219
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.012
<v Regina>Whatever we're going to relate to</v>

220
00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:13.241
and feel comfortable with, comforted by.

221
00:10:13.241 --> 00:10:15.214
<v ->Yes, whatever communicates with us.</v>

222
00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:16.761
There were reasons why these elements

223
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.208
worked for me and he knew that.

224
00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:21.666
He started to teach me stuff, he said,

225
00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:24.247
"Start writing this down, get a tape recorder.

226
00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:25.919
"You're gonna be hearing from me a lot."

227
00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.452
<v Regina>Let's start talking about what he was telling you</v>

228
00:10:28.452 --> 00:10:32.493
about how people come together into relationship,

229
00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:35.525
how family comes together and so forth.

230
00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:37.039
<v ->I wish I had a copy of the book with me</v>

231
00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:39.055
because I could read you this great quote.

232
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:43.095
All members of a family are there by agreement

233
00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:47.340
to work out certain issues that you want to work with.

234
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.891
For example, if we're sitting at the cosmic conference table

235
00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:55.149
right now, I might be saying to you,

236
00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:57.371
"I really need to work on greed.

237
00:10:57.371 --> 00:10:58.800
"I've got some stuff with that." and so you

238
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.433
might say to me, "Let's plan this out."

239
00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:03.289
It's like rolling a map out on the table,

240
00:11:03.289 --> 00:11:05.124
and you'll say, "I'll tell you what, how about

241
00:11:05.124 --> 00:11:07.767
"I'll incarnate as your rich uncle

242
00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.580
"and I'll leave you out of my will."

243
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.063
Someone else will pipe in and say,

244
00:11:11.063 --> 00:11:14.900
"I'll be the abusive mother who neglects and abuses you

245
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.684
"and that way you can learn about self sufficiency."

246
00:11:17.684 --> 00:11:19.306
Somebody else will throw in something else

247
00:11:19.306 --> 00:11:21.140
and that's how we plan our incarnation.

248
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.313
Here we are, we pop into Earth and we've got this family

249
00:11:24.313 --> 00:11:27.422
and it's such a gift of healing

250
00:11:27.422 --> 00:11:29.096
to be able to look at it this way because

251
00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:30.696
you don't feel like a victim, you don't say,

252
00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:32.787
"Why did the uncle leave me out of the will?

253
00:11:32.787 --> 00:11:35.741
"and why did my mother neglect and abuse me?"

254
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:38.642
We know why, and when we can look at it

255
00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:41.586
as what a beautiful conscious agreement

256
00:11:41.586 --> 00:11:44.700
we've made to work on certain things,

257
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.975
it's just gratitude, not victim-ness that we feel.

258
00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:52.519
<v Regina>Right, right. It's all done by design.</v>

259
00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:56.157
Where does the whole notion of karmic repercussions

260
00:11:56.157 --> 00:11:59.868
play into it? Or is he saying that doesn't exist?

261
00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:03.510
<v ->It doesn't exist. It absolutely doesn't exist.</v>

262
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.590
Karma does exist, but not in the way most people

263
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.489
understand it, and I actually talk about this

264
00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:10.473
a lot in my next book, which is

265
00:12:10.473 --> 00:12:14.518
the idea of karma came to us from

266
00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:17.183
the Tibetan Buddhists who were exiled

267
00:12:17.183 --> 00:12:19.348
when the Chinese invaded Tibet in 1950

268
00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:22.981
and all of those teachings were kept

269
00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:25.584
sequestered in the Himalayas because

270
00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:27.440
they couldn't get out and people couldn't get in

271
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.102
so it was sort of a secret teaching,

272
00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:32.078
but when Tibet was invaded and they came out

273
00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:34.883
they fled to India and eventually trickled to the west

274
00:12:34.883 --> 00:12:36.280
and that's how we got Buddhism,

275
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.624
that's how we got Zen was because of that,

276
00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:42.374
and along with it came the concept of karma.

277
00:12:42.374 --> 00:12:45.075
Westerners looked at the concept of karma

278
00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:48.371
and filtered it through our Judeo-Christian version

279
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.899
of good and evil, judgement and punishment.

280
00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:53.671
So we came up with these ideas like good and bad karma:

281
00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:56.081
if you do something bad, then that same

282
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:58.385
bad thing will come back to you.

283
00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:00.166
That's not exactly true.

284
00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:02.097
What Danny and the teachers have told me

285
00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:05.340
is that karma is balanced, not paid back.

286
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.229
<v Regina>Right.</v>

287
00:13:06.229 --> 00:13:07.082
<v ->There's a big difference.</v>

288
00:13:07.082 --> 00:13:09.002
<v Regina>Everything's about balance, absolutely.</v>

289
00:13:09.002 --> 00:13:13.834
<v ->So if I was a serial killer, I might choose to be</v>

290
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:17.019
the victim of a serial killing in another incarnation

291
00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:19.916
because I choose to balance that energy,

292
00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:22.732
but nobody's making that choice but my own soul.

293
00:13:22.732 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Regina>He made that clear, and I think</v>

294
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.386
this is a really good point that

295
00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:31.226
people hear is that no one is forced

296
00:13:31.226 --> 00:13:33.637
to reincarnate or to incarnate at all.

297
00:13:33.637 --> 00:13:35.141
<v ->Exactly.</v>

298
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:37.007
<v Regina>It changes everything when we have</v>

299
00:13:37.007 --> 00:13:39.845
that one basic understanding though, doesn't it?

300
00:13:39.845 --> 00:13:43.955
<v ->Well because that brings to the question of free will.</v>

301
00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:47.225
Some schools of thought, the Hindu school of thought

302
00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:51.331
is that we're stuck on this wheel of incarnation

303
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:55.214
and I can't speak to what the true traditional

304
00:13:55.214 --> 00:13:57.837
Hindu view is, but most people think it means

305
00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.853
that we're stuck and I'm pretty sure that's

306
00:13:59.853 --> 00:14:01.406
not what it means, that's not what

307
00:14:01.406 --> 00:14:03.702
I've been taught, is that it's a choice.

308
00:14:03.702 --> 00:14:07.371
We can incarnate by choice because we're curious

309
00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:11.787
because we're insatiable for information and learning

310
00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:14.710
or we could just be vapor, or we could

311
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.959
be somewhere else or we can be teachers.

312
00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:19.241
Right now my son is telling me that

313
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:21.566
he hasn't decided if he wants to come back

314
00:14:21.566 --> 00:14:24.073
to Earth or not, because he wants to be

315
00:14:24.073 --> 00:14:26.206
a teacher and healer but he knows

316
00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:28.968
there's more stuff he wants to do in physical form

317
00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:31.016
but right now he's working really hard

318
00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:33.982
in this form and he can choose.

319
00:14:33.982 --> 00:14:36.371
The other issue that comes into this

320
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:38.269
is that there is no time.

321
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:39.286
<v Regina>Right.</v>

322
00:14:39.286 --> 00:14:40.951
<v ->If you start thinking about time it's like</v>

323
00:14:40.951 --> 00:14:43.095
we have to hurry up and incarnate

324
00:14:43.095 --> 00:14:46.338
and it's endless, time doesn't even exist

325
00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:48.311
so if you don't incarnate for the next

326
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:51.689
million years, that's perfectly fine.

327
00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:53.099
Whatever lessons you want to learn

328
00:14:53.099 --> 00:14:55.531
you're gonna get them eventually.

329
00:14:55.531 --> 00:14:57.344
<v Regina>Right, right. Well let's talk about</v>

330
00:14:57.344 --> 00:14:59.083
what happens. Did he speak of his own

331
00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:01.791
experience, why he chose an incarnation

332
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:04.072
with a body that was to essentially

333
00:15:04.072 --> 00:15:06.759
ware out by the age of 16?

334
00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:09.669
<v ->Yeah he talked about that a lot.</v>

335
00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:12.505
It's a really long story, it goes back to--

336
00:15:12.505 --> 00:15:14.031
[Regina] Well if you can kind of encapsulate

337
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:18.812
in general why a being would choose to live

338
00:15:18.812 --> 00:15:21.495
out an incarnation in a body that's either

339
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:26.272
very ill or disabled and what the learning is and so forth.

340
00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:30.133
<v ->Basically, a choice to live with very little ego.</v>

341
00:15:30.133 --> 00:15:32.245
If you don't have a body to deal with,

342
00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:34.058
if you're not concerned with how you look

343
00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.935
and how you appear to other people,

344
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:40.202
if you're not concerned with sex and success

345
00:15:40.202 --> 00:15:41.876
in the physical world, all those things that come

346
00:15:41.876 --> 00:15:44.221
with a body, then you're free to just concentrate

347
00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:46.098
on the spiritual things, and that's

348
00:15:46.098 --> 00:15:50.045
the basic incarnation 101 version of it.

349
00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:53.810
For him in particular, his illness was part

350
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:58.810
of an agreement we had to bring me to doing this teaching.

351
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.944
It was kind of like if you go back to that

352
00:16:00.944 --> 00:16:05.220
cosmic conference table, my request was

353
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.603
I want to develop my inter-dimensional communication skills,

354
00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:12.067
and I want to be a spiritual teacher.

355
00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:15.480
His request was that he wanted to do that too

356
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.213
so this was kind of a program that we

357
00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:22.868
came up with for lack of a better word.

358
00:16:22.868 --> 00:16:25.085
The people I work with now that I teach

359
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:28.146
meditation and after death communication to,

360
00:16:28.146 --> 00:16:30.418
almost all of them have lost a loved one

361
00:16:30.418 --> 00:16:34.066
in a tragic way, lost a child, and I say to them

362
00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.945
this is an answer to your request

363
00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:39.591
to develop your intuitive skills.

364
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:43.420
What better way to learn how to work that muscle

365
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.446
than to have somebody on the other side

366
00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:50.330
that you really want to talk to? So that was part of it.

367
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.011
The illness was about caregiving, was part of

368
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:58.403
preparation for me to become a hospice worker.

369
00:16:58.403 --> 00:17:02.861
For him it was about releasing attachment to the body

370
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.816
and doing his work as a teacher.

371
00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:08.759
It was a... I hate to use the word sacrifice,

372
00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:12.823
I call it volunteerism. He was an unconditional volunteer.

373
00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:17.823
Some souls incarnate just to sponsor the growth of another,

374
00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:21.267
and that's what this incarnation was for him.

375
00:17:21.267 --> 00:17:23.080
<v Regina>You were also in a very challenging</v>

376
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.022
personal relationship at the same time.

377
00:17:25.022 --> 00:17:28.040
You had a lot going on, a lot you were dealing with.

378
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.315
Did you learn more about your personal relationships

379
00:17:31.315 --> 00:17:34.824
as well as a result of this communication and experience?

380
00:17:34.824 --> 00:17:37.053
<v ->Yeah that was a big part of it.</v>

381
00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:39.634
My husband that I was with during

382
00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:41.671
the entire ten years of Danny's illness,

383
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:44.274
from the day Danny started showing symptoms,

384
00:17:44.274 --> 00:17:48.696
that was two weeks later that husband showed up.

385
00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:53.642
Ten years later, Danny died and I got divorced.

386
00:17:53.642 --> 00:17:56.052
There was this bracketed piece of time

387
00:17:56.052 --> 00:17:57.886
when the three of us were together

388
00:17:57.886 --> 00:18:01.181
and he, we'll call him Jack, was

389
00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:03.869
a really big part of this plan.

390
00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:07.412
There was so much learning there for all of us.

391
00:18:08.602 --> 00:18:13.602
What I learned from Jack was a lot of really good stuff

392
00:18:13.889 --> 00:18:17.696
about how to be alone, I learned about self sufficiency

393
00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:20.571
by being married to this particular person.

394
00:18:20.571 --> 00:18:24.264
What Jack learned I cannot say. I don't know.

395
00:18:25.274 --> 00:18:29.610
Danny gifted all of us with this experience.

396
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.511
I really do think, and Danny's told me this,

397
00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:34.164
that again he was here as a volunteer.

398
00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:36.201
Certainly Danny learned something too.

399
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:39.177
Danny learned how to be a master of stillness.

400
00:18:39.177 --> 00:18:43.827
He learned how to live in spirit

401
00:18:43.827 --> 00:18:45.961
and disconnect from the physical world

402
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.584
when he was looking at the chaos around him

403
00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:51.953
and be an anchor for us to go to

404
00:18:51.953 --> 00:18:55.782
or peace if we chose to, I chose to,

405
00:18:55.782 --> 00:18:59.472
I don't know if Jack chose to, I don't speak for him.

406
00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.701
But it was an amazing little piece of time

407
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:04.795
and it was like, when Jack showed up Danny said,

408
00:19:04.795 --> 00:19:07.760
"Oh you're here! Let's get this party started!

409
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.128
"Finally you've arrived, we've got a plan

410
00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:13.099
"and we're gonna carry it out here."

411
00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:15.039
<v Regina>One of the things that he and you're</v>

412
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.627
working with heavily now and one of the things

413
00:19:16.627 --> 00:19:18.419
that he started talking to you about

414
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:21.576
was working with your guides and the whole system

415
00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:23.134
of guidance and what that's about.

416
00:19:23.134 --> 00:19:26.437
Can you share what was shared with you?

417
00:19:27.327 --> 00:19:29.667
<v ->I already knew this, but Danny</v>

418
00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:32.568
showed it to me in absolute clarity

419
00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:34.840
that we all have guides, we're not here alone.

420
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.005
One of the things, the way he explained it to me

421
00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:39.725
was an analogy of imagine you have a little child,

422
00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:41.766
three years old, and you're taking her

423
00:19:41.766 --> 00:19:43.691
to preschool for the first time,

424
00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:45.973
and you leave her there in this strange world.

425
00:19:45.973 --> 00:19:48.576
You wouldn't just leave her there without

426
00:19:48.576 --> 00:19:50.453
checking the place out, making sure it was okay,

427
00:19:50.453 --> 00:19:52.682
making sure the teachers had your phone number

428
00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:56.158
in case of an emergency, that's how we came to Earth.

429
00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:59.731
When we left home, when we left source,

430
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:04.520
when we broke off from the great divine all

431
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.996
and decided to come to physical incarnation

432
00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:10.766
because we were curious and wanted experience,

433
00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:13.960
our mother/father/creator/source/God,

434
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.174
whatever you want to call it, didn't just

435
00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:19.278
dump us here and abandon us.

436
00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:21.561
We have these connections always

437
00:20:21.561 --> 00:20:23.223
available to us, it's always on,

438
00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:26.636
it's always there, it's always communicating.

439
00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:29.260
Our guides are constantly around us

440
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.300
and we're never here alone.

441
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.414
It's constantly heaven, heaven isn't this place

442
00:20:35.414 --> 00:20:38.081
up in the sky obviously, it's not a remote location.

443
00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:42.358
It's the energy of everything around us all the time.

444
00:20:42.358 --> 00:20:44.608
While we're here in existence, in physical

445
00:20:44.608 --> 00:20:46.976
existence, we're in touch with heaven.

446
00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:50.464
It's broadcasting to us constantly.

447
00:20:50.464 --> 00:20:53.877
It's like a TV, and if the TV's turned off,

448
00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:56.245
you think it's off, but all you have to do

449
00:20:56.245 --> 00:20:58.538
is turn it on and the stuff comes at you.

450
00:20:58.538 --> 00:21:01.610
It's like that with connecting with guides.

451
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.342
<v Regina>What about the notion</v>

452
00:21:03.342 --> 00:21:06.608
of our own essence, our own soul,

453
00:21:06.608 --> 00:21:08.390
everyone has their own word for it,

454
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.833
spirit, essence, soul, soul development,

455
00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:13.945
which is always connected with the all

456
00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:17.411
and the all information, what is it about our being

457
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:20.940
when we become multidimensional and move into

458
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.147
the physical, into this dimension

459
00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:26.326
that makes it difficult for us to communicate with

460
00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:29.323
our own other half and thus necessitating

461
00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:31.925
the need for guides, outside guides?

462
00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:35.614
<v ->That's a great question. In the physical, first of all,</v>

463
00:21:35.614 --> 00:21:39.006
there's physical density. Bodies are like brick walls.

464
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:41.959
That's the first thing that gets in the way.

465
00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:43.559
The second thing that gets in the way

466
00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:46.023
is culture and religion and all this teaching

467
00:21:46.023 --> 00:21:48.273
that we're not connected to home,

468
00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:50.310
well they do teach that but it's

469
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.313
cluttered up with a lot of other stuff.

470
00:21:54.023 --> 00:21:59.023
They have told me that there is a necessity to forget

471
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.224
our connection in order to live on Earth,

472
00:22:02.224 --> 00:22:04.987
because if we were on Earth and we knew

473
00:22:04.987 --> 00:22:06.563
all of this, we wouldn't want to

474
00:22:06.563 --> 00:22:09.671
be here anymore. We couldn't stand it here.

475
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:11.921
We would want to die all the time.

476
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:14.268
<v Regina>Yet we continue to choose this.</v>

477
00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:16.124
<v ->We continue to choose this, some of us don't.</v>

478
00:22:16.124 --> 00:22:18.054
Some of us say, "Okay I'm out of here"

479
00:22:18.054 --> 00:22:23.054
and that's why suicide isn't a sin, suicide is a choice,

480
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.063
and I think that people who choose suicide

481
00:22:26.063 --> 00:22:28.644
are in so much pain because they feel

482
00:22:28.644 --> 00:22:31.780
so separate that they just want to

483
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.146
go back to something that they feel connected to.

484
00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:36.216
I don't think they consciously think that

485
00:22:36.216 --> 00:22:39.779
but I think that's what the soul is working on.

486
00:22:42.054 --> 00:22:44.137
The people that you see wandering the streets,

487
00:22:44.137 --> 00:22:47.827
homeless people, insane people mumbling, talking to God

488
00:22:47.827 --> 00:22:50.590
as they walk down the street in New York City,

489
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.099
they have not forgotten where they come from.

490
00:22:54.099 --> 00:22:56.648
There's a little piece of the incarnation process

491
00:22:56.648 --> 00:23:00.200
that was glitched out somewhere there and they still have

492
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.549
a little connective fiber and they can't be here.

493
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.426
They don't know how to be here.

494
00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:07.218
Danny's told me this whole thing about

495
00:23:07.218 --> 00:23:09.490
what happens when we incarnate,

496
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.063
and he gives me a lot of child-like visions.

497
00:23:13.063 --> 00:23:16.039
He says it's like the movie Men in Black if you remember

498
00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:19.230
that movie where they zapped people's memories.

499
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.211
When we're ready to incarnate, we go through

500
00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:25.529
this memory erasing process so that we don't

501
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.800
remember the work that we did in-between

502
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.798
incarnations because otherwise we couldn't

503
00:23:30.798 --> 00:23:34.861
fully experience the ego and being human.

504
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:37.558
<v Regina>Let's talk about the value of that,</v>

505
00:23:37.558 --> 00:23:40.425
the value of incarnating and reincarnating.

506
00:23:41.945 --> 00:23:46.368
<v ->Well if all we want is to accumulate experience,</v>

507
00:23:46.368 --> 00:23:49.504
and apparently that is what the soul is all about

508
00:23:49.504 --> 00:23:52.991
is I just want to get bigger and expand,

509
00:23:52.991 --> 00:23:55.423
the universe has two basic forms:

510
00:23:55.423 --> 00:23:57.866
expansion and contraction.

511
00:23:57.866 --> 00:23:59.978
Expansion is just accumulating

512
00:23:59.978 --> 00:24:02.676
as much experience and wisdom as possible.

513
00:24:02.676 --> 00:24:05.183
Contraction is when it's all in there and

514
00:24:05.183 --> 00:24:07.849
it's all so tight and you squeeze it all,

515
00:24:07.849 --> 00:24:10.356
it's like making a diamond out of coal.

516
00:24:10.356 --> 00:24:14.355
It contracts so much that it turns into matter,

517
00:24:14.355 --> 00:24:16.606
that's how we come into bodies.

518
00:24:16.606 --> 00:24:19.368
If expansion is what we're doing

519
00:24:19.368 --> 00:24:21.502
and what we're motivated to do,

520
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:24.008
the best way to do that is to come to Earth

521
00:24:24.008 --> 00:24:27.869
and have this experience as many times as possible.

522
00:24:27.869 --> 00:24:29.938
We can quit anytime we want.

523
00:24:29.938 --> 00:24:31.592
<v Regina>That's true, no one holds a gun</v>

524
00:24:31.592 --> 00:24:33.535
to anybody's head to incarnate.

525
00:24:33.535 --> 00:24:35.434
(both laugh)

526
00:24:37.844 --> 00:24:39.416
Before I ask you this next question

527
00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:41.741
which goes into the work that you do now,

528
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:43.714
what were a couple of the other things

529
00:24:43.714 --> 00:24:46.818
that you learned from Danny after his departure

530
00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:50.626
in that period of time that were of really great use to you

531
00:24:50.626 --> 00:24:53.047
that you had not known or were not aware of before

532
00:24:53.047 --> 00:24:55.553
that may have even surprised you?

533
00:24:56.283 --> 00:24:57.726
<v ->The thing that comes to mind is something</v>

534
00:24:57.726 --> 00:24:59.913
that he called the healing courtyard.

535
00:24:59.913 --> 00:25:02.350
He showed me how to heal people,

536
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.640
that we can always work with each other's souls

537
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.384
and if that soul is giving permission

538
00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:12.517
to being contacted, so for example,

539
00:25:12.517 --> 00:25:16.250
he gave me a vision of a man in a hospital bed

540
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.248
in a coma, and he showed me how

541
00:25:19.248 --> 00:25:22.223
he could bring this man's soul to this place

542
00:25:22.223 --> 00:25:24.218
he called the healing courtyard.

543
00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:29.122
He always staged everything in Italian villas

544
00:25:29.122 --> 00:25:29.902
(Regina laughs)

545
00:25:29.902 --> 00:25:31.321
and 17th century, I don't know why,

546
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:32.857
probably because we had a past life there,

547
00:25:32.857 --> 00:25:34.103
I never really asked him why, but that

548
00:25:34.103 --> 00:25:36.076
always resonated with me, I like the way

549
00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.049
the light looks in those places.

550
00:25:38.049 --> 00:25:40.396
So he brings this man to this little bench

551
00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:43.233
in a courtyard and he says I'm working with

552
00:25:43.233 --> 00:25:46.155
this man's soul. He isn't sure if he wants

553
00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:49.334
to die yet, he's in this coma, but his soul

554
00:25:49.334 --> 00:25:53.888
is requesting council. So I can go to him,

555
00:25:53.888 --> 00:25:56.693
I can bring his soul here to this healing place

556
00:25:56.693 --> 00:25:59.904
and talk to him and say, "Let's look at your blueprint,

557
00:25:59.904 --> 00:26:02.250
"let's look at your plan. Here's what will happen

558
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.799
"if you leave your body now, here's what will happen

559
00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:06.911
"if you stay in for another five years

560
00:26:06.911 --> 00:26:09.631
"or 10 years or whatever. If you leave now,

561
00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:12.319
"here is the myriad of lessons

562
00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:15.135
"that you will learn, your family members,

563
00:26:15.135 --> 00:26:18.036
"everybody involved, and if you stay for another 10 years

564
00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:20.308
"you will learn this group of lessons.

565
00:26:20.308 --> 00:26:22.420
"So which would you like to choose?"

566
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.323
Not only is that man's soul making that choice,

567
00:26:26.323 --> 00:26:28.574
but all the other members of his soul family.

568
00:26:28.574 --> 00:26:30.963
His wife who is sitting next to the bed crying,

569
00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:34.035
his children who are looking over his will,

570
00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:36.840
whoever's involved on a soul level,

571
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.005
even though they're not aware of it,

572
00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:41.277
all of those souls are convening and saying,

573
00:26:41.277 --> 00:26:44.733
"How do we do this next step? If Dad dies,

574
00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:48.103
"this this and that. If Dad lives, this will happen."

575
00:26:48.103 --> 00:26:52.652
There all done by agreement, he showed me how that happens.

576
00:26:52.652 --> 00:26:56.507
A person who is dying or in a coma

577
00:26:56.507 --> 00:27:01.082
can request healing assistance

578
00:27:01.082 --> 00:27:04.469
and be greeted by people like Danny

579
00:27:04.469 --> 00:27:06.539
and guides and angels of all kinds

580
00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:09.227
to sit and help them make that decision,

581
00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.763
but don't make it alone because

582
00:27:10.763 --> 00:27:13.430
the members of their soul family are affected as well.

583
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.888
On that level, all those souls are in the mix.

584
00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:22.863
It's like pieces of a kaleidoscope.

585
00:27:22.863 --> 00:27:24.644
If you look at a kaleidoscope and it turns

586
00:27:24.644 --> 00:27:28.452
just a tiny little bit, all of the pieces restructure,

587
00:27:28.452 --> 00:27:31.310
and that's how every free will decision

588
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.417
affects every soul family.

589
00:27:35.031 --> 00:27:38.188
<v Regina>The notion of soul families,</v>

590
00:27:38.188 --> 00:27:42.945
if the desire is for the broadening of

591
00:27:42.945 --> 00:27:45.333
experience and refinement of knowledge

592
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:47.466
and so forth, why do we choose to

593
00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:51.583
continue incarnating within a soul family?

594
00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:57.114
<v ->We don't because a soul family is limitless</v>

595
00:27:57.114 --> 00:27:58.641
like the people who are your mother

596
00:27:58.641 --> 00:28:01.083
and father and children, that's just your

597
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:03.281
immediate soul family for right now,

598
00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:06.617
but since there's no time, there really is not right now.

599
00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:10.594
Soul families are if you drive your car down the street

600
00:28:10.594 --> 00:28:15.041
and hit a deer, that's a member of your soul family.

601
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:17.868
The guy who stops his truck and helps you

602
00:28:17.868 --> 00:28:21.078
deal with the deer is a member of your soul family.

603
00:28:21.078 --> 00:28:24.118
Some are really deeply involved with you,

604
00:28:24.118 --> 00:28:25.760
some are less involved with you.

605
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.947
Every experience, that hitting the deer,

606
00:28:27.947 --> 00:28:32.235
the guy who came and helped you,

607
00:28:32.235 --> 00:28:35.824
moved the kaleidoscope one little niche,

608
00:28:35.824 --> 00:28:38.533
so everybody's your soul family.

609
00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:40.400
<v Regina>That broadens it out to the extent</v>

610
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.621
where it can be any experience that you wish.

611
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:45.573
<v ->It's every experience, yeah.</v>

612
00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:47.781
<v Regina>Every experience in anywhere, in any shape.</v>

613
00:28:47.781 --> 00:28:49.477
<v ->The people that you bring close to you</v>

614
00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:50.885
like your husband and your children

615
00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:52.495
are the ones that you've got some really intense

616
00:28:52.495 --> 00:28:55.066
agreements with and really intense work to do.

617
00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:58.415
The guy who helped you on the road when you hit the deer,

618
00:28:58.415 --> 00:29:00.548
you had an agreement with him too.

619
00:29:00.548 --> 00:29:03.076
This is what I often tell parents who are grieving

620
00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:07.310
over the death of a child who got killed by a drunk driver.

621
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.758
The drunk driver, your child, you, the driver's family,

622
00:29:11.758 --> 00:29:14.531
the police, the paramedics, everybody

623
00:29:14.531 --> 00:29:18.243
in that widening circle, agreed to be here

624
00:29:18.243 --> 00:29:20.845
at this moment for this experience, for each of them

625
00:29:20.845 --> 00:29:25.845
there was a requested growth lesson.

626
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:29.223
Some of the parents say to me,

627
00:29:29.223 --> 00:29:32.561
"No that can't be! I can't see it that way.

628
00:29:32.561 --> 00:29:35.668
"That man killed my child," and I say

629
00:29:35.668 --> 00:29:38.100
you can choose how you want to see it

630
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.520
and you can be in "that man killed my child"

631
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.210
and work with it that way, or you can be in,

632
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.397
"maybe we all had an agreement to meet

633
00:29:46.397 --> 00:29:48.690
"here at this moment for this experience"

634
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.621
and work with it that way.

635
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:53.820
<v Regina>Yes. Now going to the work</v>

636
00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.372
you do with this because you help people

637
00:29:56.372 --> 00:29:59.998
establish communication with those they love

638
00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:01.673
on the other side, for those who are

639
00:30:01.673 --> 00:30:03.230
not familiar with it and as you say

640
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.544
anyone can do this and I did this myself,

641
00:30:05.544 --> 00:30:07.432
I've done it with a number of people,

642
00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:09.608
but certainly my mother,

643
00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:12.861
to the final dream where she came and said,

644
00:30:12.861 --> 00:30:15.069
"Do you know how tired it makes me to come

645
00:30:15.069 --> 00:30:17.736
"just because you and your sister call me?"

646
00:30:17.736 --> 00:30:20.616
and I said, "Mom, don't come anymore.

647
00:30:20.616 --> 00:30:23.655
"You don't have to do that, we're fine. You can go now."

648
00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:25.565
She never came back after that.

649
00:30:25.565 --> 00:30:27.484
She went to my sister the same night,

650
00:30:27.484 --> 00:30:29.831
so we both had a chance to once again

651
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:32.945
say go well, be free and so forth

652
00:30:32.945 --> 00:30:35.804
and communicate with her up to that point

653
00:30:35.804 --> 00:30:37.660
and then that communication ended,

654
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.676
and with others as well.

655
00:30:39.676 --> 00:30:41.958
We can all do this, but there seems to be

656
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:44.465
a stumbling block of belief for a lot of people.

657
00:30:44.465 --> 00:30:47.014
They seem to feel that it's not possible.

658
00:30:47.014 --> 00:30:48.987
How do you begin working with people

659
00:30:48.987 --> 00:30:51.547
to find this means of communication?

660
00:30:51.547 --> 00:30:53.840
<v ->How soon after her death did this happen?</v>

661
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.462
<v Regina>I communicated with her as she was dying</v>

662
00:30:56.462 --> 00:31:00.504
and then certainly about an hour

663
00:31:00.504 --> 00:31:04.621
before she left her body and then right after,

664
00:31:04.621 --> 00:31:07.448
and then this went on for a couple of years where after that

665
00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:10.168
more than my directly communicating with her

666
00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:13.463
and talking with her, she would show up in dreams.

667
00:31:13.463 --> 00:31:15.597
Finally she said, "This makes me very tired

668
00:31:15.597 --> 00:31:17.783
"to come from where I am to where you are."

669
00:31:17.783 --> 00:31:19.735
We didn't need anything from her,

670
00:31:19.735 --> 00:31:21.410
we weren't looking for guidance.

671
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.564
<v ->This is a really good point.</v>

672
00:31:23.564 --> 00:31:27.308
In the very beginning it's difficult

673
00:31:27.308 --> 00:31:30.369
for some of them, because they're in shock

674
00:31:30.369 --> 00:31:33.057
and it's a long distance for them to go

675
00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:35.915
but not every person, the minute

676
00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:38.820
they die instantly has this ability.

677
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.290
[Regina] Exactly, yeah.

678
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.755
I did a workshop with a group of people

679
00:31:44.755 --> 00:31:47.720
and I put them through a meditation

680
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.650
where they could all contact somebody,

681
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.805
most of them were contacting parents.

682
00:31:51.805 --> 00:31:55.037
After we did the meditation, they reported

683
00:31:55.037 --> 00:31:56.914
what they experienced and it was interesting

684
00:31:56.914 --> 00:32:00.540
that most people saw their dead parents as younger people.

685
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.719
<v Regina>Yes, my mother showed up as about 19 years old.</v>

686
00:32:03.719 --> 00:32:05.319
<v ->Exactly. Okay.</v>

687
00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:07.271
<v Regina>Another person was there and they saw her</v>

688
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:10.342
in exactly the same clothing, at exactly the same age

689
00:32:10.342 --> 00:32:12.006
with the same beings around her,

690
00:32:12.006 --> 00:32:13.660
so it wasn't just me seeing it,

691
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.334
so she was really projecting it.

692
00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:16.463
<v ->Yes, and the reason they show up</v>

693
00:32:16.463 --> 00:32:18.511
as younger people, because all these people

694
00:32:18.511 --> 00:32:20.900
were in their 70's and 80's when they died.

695
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.087
Everyone in the room raised their hand and said,

696
00:32:23.087 --> 00:32:25.412
"Me too! I saw her so young, why is that?"

697
00:32:25.412 --> 00:32:27.492
It was really the first time I noticed that

698
00:32:27.492 --> 00:32:29.678
so I just tuned in and asked my guides

699
00:32:29.678 --> 00:32:33.936
and they said because they are just learning this skill.

700
00:32:33.936 --> 00:32:35.650
Just because somebody dies doesn't mean

701
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.687
they're automatically enlightened,

702
00:32:37.687 --> 00:32:41.217
automatically capable of inter-dimensional travel,

703
00:32:41.217 --> 00:32:44.311
it doesn't just come with the territory, it's not a given.

704
00:32:44.311 --> 00:32:47.212
These beings who are being called,

705
00:32:47.212 --> 00:32:50.454
like your mother, haven't worked on that skill,

706
00:32:50.454 --> 00:32:53.057
it hasn't been in their curriculum yet.

707
00:32:53.057 --> 00:32:54.518
<v Regina>No, she was getting quite a bit</v>

708
00:32:54.518 --> 00:32:55.990
of help from behind her, and also

709
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.398
she was in a coma for awhile before

710
00:32:57.398 --> 00:32:58.891
so she has a little time to transition--

711
00:32:58.891 --> 00:33:00.768
<v ->She had to practice, but still</v>

712
00:33:00.768 --> 00:33:03.179
inter-dimensional communication

713
00:33:03.179 --> 00:33:06.391
is not her... specialty.

714
00:33:06.391 --> 00:33:07.492
<v Regina>Yeah exactly.</v>

715
00:33:07.492 --> 00:33:08.381
(both laugh)

716
00:33:08.381 --> 00:33:10.237
<v ->But for some people it is because</v>

717
00:33:10.237 --> 00:33:12.242
some people are meant to be teachers

718
00:33:12.242 --> 00:33:13.746
and communicators, and some people

719
00:33:13.746 --> 00:33:15.367
are busy doing something else.

720
00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:17.735
My son started communicating perfectly

721
00:33:17.735 --> 00:33:20.039
30 minutes after he died, where for others,

722
00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:22.602
that's why we see them younger.

723
00:33:23.552 --> 00:33:25.284
My son always said to me,

724
00:33:25.284 --> 00:33:26.211
because sometimes I see him and

725
00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:28.995
he looks 11, and sometimes he looks 30.

726
00:33:28.995 --> 00:33:31.278
He said, "When I look young, I'm in learning mode,

727
00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:33.272
"and when I look old, I'm in teaching mode."

728
00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:35.107
We're seeing our parents looking

729
00:33:35.107 --> 00:33:36.685
younger because they're learning.

730
00:33:36.685 --> 00:33:38.754
The fact that you're calling them and

731
00:33:38.754 --> 00:33:41.773
bringing them in is a teaching for them,

732
00:33:41.773 --> 00:33:43.576
and it does make them tired.

733
00:33:43.576 --> 00:33:45.346
It's a lot of work for them to do that.

734
00:33:45.346 --> 00:33:47.245
They have to lower their frequency.

735
00:33:47.245 --> 00:33:49.058
<v Regina>Exactly, and that's what she was</v>

736
00:33:49.058 --> 00:33:51.682
explaining to me and it's, "Oh, no problem

737
00:33:51.682 --> 00:33:53.474
"Mom! Go have fun!"

738
00:33:53.474 --> 00:33:55.095
<v ->How hard is it for you to raise your frequency?</v>

739
00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:56.006
<v Regina>Exactly, exactly.</v>

740
00:33:56.006 --> 00:33:57.021
<v ->And so you meet in the middle.</v>

741
00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:58.418
<v Regina>It was very interesting,</v>

742
00:33:58.418 --> 00:34:00.850
she was very exhausted trying to come through

743
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.964
those frequencies into the more dense one to communicate.

744
00:34:03.964 --> 00:34:06.748
<v ->So she's saying this isn't really my thing.</v>

745
00:34:06.748 --> 00:34:07.661
(laughs)

746
00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:09.076
<v Regina>Exactly. This is hard work</v>

747
00:34:09.076 --> 00:34:10.899
and you don't need me anyway, so let me go.

748
00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:12.830
<v ->Go find another guide, there's plenty</v>

749
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.312
of people here who can help you.

750
00:34:14.312 --> 00:34:15.773
<v Regina>Exactly, and that was fine.</v>

751
00:34:15.773 --> 00:34:18.589
<v ->By now, she's probably gotten better at it</v>

752
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.512
if it's something she's choosing to work on,

753
00:34:21.512 --> 00:34:22.930
and it may not be.

754
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:23.879
<v Regina>I don't think so.</v>

755
00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:24.669
<v ->Not everybody does this.</v>

756
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:25.669
<v Regina>Yet, another person I spoke with</v>

757
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:27.709
right after they died stayed fully mature,

758
00:34:27.709 --> 00:34:29.650
awake, and was quite a rascal.

759
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.561
I said, "Where'd you hide the money?"

760
00:34:31.561 --> 00:34:32.671
(Regina laughs)

761
00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:33.988
and he showed me where the money was hidden

762
00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:36.036
so his wife could have the advantage of it,

763
00:34:36.036 --> 00:34:37.871
because he had hidden it from her too.

764
00:34:37.871 --> 00:34:39.012
<v ->And you found the money?</v>

765
00:34:39.012 --> 00:34:39.820
<v Regina>Yeah, oh yeah.</v>

766
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.734
<v ->Wow, that's great.</v>

767
00:34:40.734 --> 00:34:41.833
<v Regina>But that was within 24 hours of</v>

768
00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:44.659
his death, so he was very available.

769
00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.695
<v ->He was prepared--</v>

770
00:34:45.695 --> 00:34:46.545
<v Regina>He was totally prepared.</v>

771
00:34:46.545 --> 00:34:47.501
<v ->because this is something that he planned.</v>

772
00:34:47.501 --> 00:34:49.364
In a coma for three months prior, too.

773
00:34:49.364 --> 00:34:50.255
<v ->Wow.</v>

774
00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:51.398
<v Regina>Very interesting but also</v>

775
00:34:51.398 --> 00:34:54.123
a little more advanced in those understandings.

776
00:34:54.123 --> 00:34:56.294
Each one, it's a different journey.

777
00:34:56.294 --> 00:35:01.009
Each one of us here has the ability to connect.

778
00:35:01.009 --> 00:35:04.404
What do you do when you begin the process

779
00:35:04.404 --> 00:35:06.665
of showing someone that they can do this,

780
00:35:06.665 --> 00:35:08.403
how does that start for most people?

781
00:35:08.403 --> 00:35:10.771
<v ->If I was working with someone one-on-one</v>

782
00:35:10.771 --> 00:35:12.531
like someone who came to me as a client

783
00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:15.923
or a group if I was doing a six week workshop,

784
00:35:15.923 --> 00:35:19.709
I would start of course by giving them

785
00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:21.779
books to read and material to study,

786
00:35:21.779 --> 00:35:23.048
that would be the first place.

787
00:35:23.048 --> 00:35:25.728
Just to sort of see where they are

788
00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:26.989
because there's such good information

789
00:35:26.989 --> 00:35:29.634
out there, there's a lot of good books

790
00:35:29.634 --> 00:35:31.511
and a lot of good places to start.

791
00:35:31.511 --> 00:35:34.252
Along the way I would also walk them through

792
00:35:34.252 --> 00:35:36.791
various guided meditations that start out

793
00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:40.919
very simple of just breathing and feeling.

794
00:35:40.919 --> 00:35:43.937
I have real special music that I use

795
00:35:43.937 --> 00:35:48.118
that I search high and low over the internet for

796
00:35:48.118 --> 00:35:51.201
meditation music and I can find this music

797
00:35:51.201 --> 00:35:53.899
that's so rare and so amazing.

798
00:35:53.899 --> 00:35:55.638
<v Regina>This is important in a lot of different</v>

799
00:35:55.638 --> 00:35:58.614
beliefs, disciplines, cultures and so forth,

800
00:35:58.614 --> 00:36:00.815
the music that's used when you're trying to connect.

801
00:36:00.815 --> 00:36:02.632
<v ->I think so, and I'm not really much</v>

802
00:36:02.632 --> 00:36:05.043
of a music person, but when I started doing this work

803
00:36:05.043 --> 00:36:08.611
music became so important and I have found music

804
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:11.259
that I don't even know how it comes to me.

805
00:36:11.259 --> 00:36:14.982
I find it online, I find this rare CD of meditation music

806
00:36:14.982 --> 00:36:18.576
that you can only buy in England, and it costs $45

807
00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:21.648
and I order the CD and I can never find it again.

808
00:36:21.648 --> 00:36:23.547
People ask me, "Where did you find that?"

809
00:36:23.547 --> 00:36:25.797
and I say, "Here's what it is. Go look for it."

810
00:36:25.797 --> 00:36:28.421
Nobody can find it. I don't even know how it comes to me.

811
00:36:28.421 --> 00:36:30.949
The music and the breathing is really important.

812
00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:35.640
It's basically hypnotherapy, it just puts you into a state,

813
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.244
a heightened state and visualization, very simple stuff.

814
00:36:40.244 --> 00:36:43.145
Walking through a meadow, somebody's standing there.

815
00:36:43.145 --> 00:36:45.811
They give you something, what did they give you?

816
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:47.134
They're saying something to you,

817
00:36:47.134 --> 00:36:49.363
what do you hear them say?

818
00:36:49.363 --> 00:36:50.803
Before I do these meditations,

819
00:36:50.803 --> 00:36:54.362
I prepare them with a list of things to watch out for.

820
00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:58.690
You're not gonna see flying tables and flickering lights,

821
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.620
though you might, some people do.

822
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.148
You're not gonna probably hear verbal

823
00:37:03.148 --> 00:37:06.543
words that your ears can hear.

824
00:37:07.123 --> 00:37:09.940
They talk to us in symbols.

825
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.090
If you meet a guide in this meditation

826
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.948
or your dead father, he might hand you

827
00:37:15.948 --> 00:37:20.948
a belt buckle or a hair brush. Don't dismiss that.

828
00:37:21.132 --> 00:37:23.201
In our minds, what we do because the ego

829
00:37:23.201 --> 00:37:25.633
is always in control, or tries to be, it's like,

830
00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:27.702
"That's just a belt buckle, that doesn't mean anything."

831
00:37:27.702 --> 00:37:29.793
Then you shut it down, and it's gone.

832
00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:32.479
I walk them through a process of learning

833
00:37:32.479 --> 00:37:35.338
to accept whatever they get, and if the being

834
00:37:35.338 --> 00:37:38.074
whoever it is says to them,

835
00:37:40.186 --> 00:37:41.816
"Black shoe on a pink floor"

836
00:37:41.816 --> 00:37:44.813
or some ridiculous thing, allow that to be true.

837
00:37:44.813 --> 00:37:47.480
I also have them write everything down

838
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.410
that they hear or experience.

839
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.458
<v Regina>This is critical. Allowing themselves</v>

840
00:37:51.458 --> 00:37:53.612
to take it in without invalidating.

841
00:37:53.612 --> 00:37:56.866
I think that's probably one of the most critical things.

842
00:37:56.866 --> 00:37:59.159
<v ->Before I will even walk them through</v>

843
00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:01.900
a meditation like this, I put them through this checklist

844
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.438
of all the things to watch out for, and

845
00:38:04.438 --> 00:38:06.668
they get it, they do really well at it.

846
00:38:06.668 --> 00:38:08.748
In most of my groups, at least half

847
00:38:08.748 --> 00:38:11.702
of the people make contact easily,

848
00:38:11.702 --> 00:38:13.697
and they're amazed at what they get.

849
00:38:13.697 --> 00:38:15.136
<v Regina>And the other half could</v>

850
00:38:15.136 --> 00:38:16.854
if they had the confidence in themselves

851
00:38:16.854 --> 00:38:18.646
and were not invalidating what's coming along

852
00:38:18.646 --> 00:38:20.715
among whatever else may be going on

853
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:22.475
in their lives, fears of some kind

854
00:38:22.475 --> 00:38:24.587
and whatever blocks us from learning.

855
00:38:24.587 --> 00:38:26.101
<v ->That's absolutely true.</v>

856
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:27.562
<v Regina>So you're saying every human being</v>

857
00:38:27.562 --> 00:38:29.717
does have the capability of doing this?

858
00:38:29.717 --> 00:38:32.693
<v ->Absolutely. The beings around us in the higher realms,</v>

859
00:38:32.693 --> 00:38:35.082
our loved ones, our guides, are standing there

860
00:38:35.082 --> 00:38:36.778
next to us all the time going,

861
00:38:36.778 --> 00:38:39.644
"I'm here! Can't you see me?"

862
00:38:40.774 --> 00:38:42.105
They're always out there, they're always

863
00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:45.467
wanting to talk to us, but they're also infinitely patient,

864
00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:48.646
because if there's no time, you can't be impatient.

865
00:38:48.646 --> 00:38:50.534
I say that to my son a lot because sometimes

866
00:38:50.534 --> 00:38:53.456
I'll really feel him calling me, there'll be some message

867
00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:56.037
that he's trying to give me, and I'm busy.

868
00:38:56.037 --> 00:38:58.352
The way I talk to him is I journal.

869
00:38:58.352 --> 00:39:01.765
I hear him all the time, but when something big comes

870
00:39:01.765 --> 00:39:03.909
I have to sit down at my computer

871
00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:06.298
and he just starts writing through me.

872
00:39:06.298 --> 00:39:08.506
I'll say, "I feel you calling me, I know you're

873
00:39:08.506 --> 00:39:10.618
"trying to tell me something, but

874
00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:12.928
"I can't do it right now, can you wait?"

875
00:39:12.928 --> 00:39:13.561
(Regina laughs)

876
00:39:13.561 --> 00:39:16.718
Then I feel bad and guilty, so the next time I talk to him

877
00:39:16.718 --> 00:39:21.176
I'll say, "Do you feel bad that I push you away sometimes?"

878
00:39:21.176 --> 00:39:24.953
and he says, "How can I be impatient if there's no time?"

879
00:39:24.953 --> 00:39:26.663
<v Regina>(laughs) very true</v>

880
00:39:26.663 --> 00:39:29.651
There has to be time to be impatient.

881
00:39:29.651 --> 00:39:31.678
All the time in the world, everything's broadcasting

882
00:39:31.678 --> 00:39:36.360
at you constantly, you can receive it at your own pace.

883
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.449
<v Regina>Yes. You call the book A Swan in Heaven</v>

884
00:39:39.449 --> 00:39:42.265
and I see you have a swan necklace on,

885
00:39:42.265 --> 00:39:44.888
why A Swan in Heaven?

886
00:39:44.888 --> 00:39:49.333
<v ->(sighs) When he was 11 years old, it was</v>

887
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.861
when September 11th happened, and

888
00:39:51.861 --> 00:39:53.514
I was watching a documentary on TV

889
00:39:53.514 --> 00:39:56.319
about the firefighters whose partners had died,

890
00:39:56.319 --> 00:39:58.804
and the firefighters felt guilty that

891
00:39:58.804 --> 00:40:00.991
they hadn't saved their partners,

892
00:40:00.991 --> 00:40:03.124
and they went and got tattoos of

893
00:40:03.124 --> 00:40:05.791
their partners' face on their backs.

894
00:40:05.791 --> 00:40:09.044
Full shoulder to shoulder neck to waist tattoos

895
00:40:09.044 --> 00:40:11.230
so that they felt like their partner

896
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.990
was with them all the time.

897
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.985
I saw this and I said, "That's great,

898
00:40:14.985 --> 00:40:17.566
"I have to get a tattoo for Danny."

899
00:40:17.566 --> 00:40:19.976
I asked him, when he could still talk,

900
00:40:19.976 --> 00:40:22.163
if you could be any animal, what would you be?

901
00:40:22.163 --> 00:40:23.497
He said a swan.

902
00:40:23.497 --> 00:40:24.560
<v Regina>Aw.</v>

903
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.019
<v ->I thought, he's an 11 year old boy,</v>

904
00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:28.545
why would he pick a swan?

905
00:40:28.545 --> 00:40:33.195
A wolf, a dinosaur, a dragon, a swan?

906
00:40:33.195 --> 00:40:36.096
So I asked him 10 times, "Are you sure?"

907
00:40:36.096 --> 00:40:38.603
I didn't even know he knew what a swan was.

908
00:40:38.603 --> 00:40:41.365
I was pretty sure he'd never seen one.

909
00:40:41.365 --> 00:40:44.106
I kept saying, "Are you sure?" and he said, "Yes, a swan."

910
00:40:44.106 --> 00:40:48.767
So I got a tattoo of a swan and I bought this

911
00:40:48.767 --> 00:40:51.826
and now I have this whole swan thing.

912
00:40:51.826 --> 00:40:55.156
I began researching what does swan mean

913
00:40:55.156 --> 00:40:57.759
in various cultures, and I found out

914
00:40:57.759 --> 00:40:59.593
that in the Keltic culture and also

915
00:40:59.593 --> 00:41:01.407
in the Native American culture

916
00:41:01.407 --> 00:41:03.870
and probably many others, it means transition.

917
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.085
The ugly duckling turns into a swan.

918
00:41:07.085 --> 00:41:12.018
In the medicine cards, the swan travels between two worlds.

919
00:41:12.018 --> 00:41:14.663
It goes into dream time, from Earth

920
00:41:14.663 --> 00:41:16.732
to dream time with a dragonfly.

921
00:41:16.732 --> 00:41:18.076
There's this whole story.

922
00:41:18.076 --> 00:41:22.737
So he knew that a swan was about moving between worlds.

923
00:41:22.737 --> 00:41:23.857
<v Regina>How perfect.</v>

924
00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:26.108
<v ->So that's why the book is called that.</v>

925
00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:27.270
<v Regina>Any final thoughts because</v>

926
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.542
we can let people pick up a copy of the book

927
00:41:29.542 --> 00:41:33.446
to get the full detailed experiences and dialoge

928
00:41:33.446 --> 00:41:35.163
that was going on between you and your son

929
00:41:35.163 --> 00:41:38.043
on these really very critical subjects

930
00:41:38.043 --> 00:41:39.856
that all of us, areas of life,

931
00:41:39.856 --> 00:41:41.851
every one of us has to interface with.

932
00:41:41.851 --> 00:41:44.123
You have a new book coming out also in Spring

933
00:41:44.123 --> 00:41:48.773
of 2010 about embracing death and the nuances there.

934
00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:53.090
So any final thoughts you have before we wrap it up?

935
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.684
<v ->I think that if I could say one thing to the world,</v>

936
00:41:56.684 --> 00:42:01.462
it would be we're not alone. We're not alone here.

937
00:42:01.462 --> 00:42:03.862
UFO people say that all the time,

938
00:42:03.862 --> 00:42:08.086
but it's much more than that. Marianne Williamson said,

939
00:42:08.086 --> 00:42:11.680
"If you had any idea who was walking with you,

940
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.422
"you would never be afraid of anything."

941
00:42:14.422 --> 00:42:17.438
I would add to that: least of all, death.

942
00:42:17.438 --> 00:42:21.654
Death is just like walking into the next room.

943
00:42:21.654 --> 00:42:26.193
When you lose your fear of death, you lose your fear.

944
00:42:27.963 --> 00:42:32.963
Fear of death is the core of all neurosis in human life.

945
00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:36.228
The ego just wants to survive,

946
00:42:36.228 --> 00:42:38.422
the ego just wants to be in control.

947
00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:42.692
With that craving for control and security

948
00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:45.668
we create greed, manipulation,

949
00:42:45.668 --> 00:42:49.476
rape, violence, all of that stuff.

950
00:42:49.476 --> 00:42:53.091
It really comes from the ego's fear of disappearance.

951
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.534
When you realize that your essence

952
00:42:55.534 --> 00:42:58.428
cannot ever disappear, what could

953
00:42:58.428 --> 00:43:01.532
there possibly be to be afraid of?

954
00:43:01.532 --> 00:43:03.718
<v Regina>So well said. Thank you so much</v>

955
00:43:03.718 --> 00:43:05.477
for your time, Terri. I really appreciate

956
00:43:05.477 --> 00:43:08.058
you telling us this beautiful story.

957
00:43:08.058 --> 00:43:10.610
<v ->Thank you. Thank you Regina.</v>

958
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.381
(soothing piano music)

959
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:14.141
<v ->Terri wrote a book about her experience</v>

960
00:43:14.141 --> 00:43:16.210
and the lessons shared by her son titled

961
00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.482
A Swan in Heaven. You can go to her site

962
