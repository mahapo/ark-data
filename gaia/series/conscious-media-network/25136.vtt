00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:10.463
﻿- About 15 years ago,

2
00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:12.397
I watched the film Life After Life,

3
00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:14.098
which became part of my all-time

4
00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:16.601
must-see list of impactful videos.

5
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:19.153
The subject was near-death experiences,

6
00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.772
featuring Dr. Raymond Moody.

7
00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:22.607
Raymond, as he prefers to be called,

8
00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:24.258
is referred to as the father

9
00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.710
of near-death experiences.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.446
But, he will, and did, quickly correct anyone

11
00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:30.348
who proffers this title upon him,

12
00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.284
and saying that Plato is, in truth,

13
00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:34.519
the father of near-death experiences.

14
00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.164
His life is a paradox,

15
00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:37.822
in that he's devoted 50 years

16
00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:39.658
to understanding and documenting

17
00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:41.792
a phenomenon that is often referred to

18
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.695
as a spiritual experience,

19
00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:46.898
while maintaining that NDEs can also be explained

20
00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:49.551
through pure logic.

21
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:54.968
Raymond, you have such an iconic kind of background

22
00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:57.175
in the subject of near-death experience,

23
00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:59.344
and I know that you don't really view it that way,

24
00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:01.012
per se, but that's the fact.

25
00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:04.883
I mean, the original film, Life After Life,

26
00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:07.002
through the last couple of decades is,

27
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.990
I have given that to people

28
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.108
that are approaching the end,

29
00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:12.724
with such pleasure,

30
00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:15.059
because of the joy that it brings people,

31
00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:17.862
to see that this experience is truly

32
00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.532
the passageway back to the true self.

33
00:01:20.532 --> 00:01:23.101
And, on that note,

34
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.471
I heard you say, in your lecture last night,

35
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:26.972
you've never been a religious person,

36
00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.923
and you were raised in the south.

37
00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:29.837
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>I assume</v>

38
00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:31.018
it was kind of bible-belt country?

39
00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:35.114
<v ->My dad was a military officer, a surgeon,</v>

40
00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:39.934
and served in World War Two, in the Pacific theater,

41
00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:40.952
as a medic.

42
00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:44.289
And, he went away to World War Two,

43
00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.724
on the day I was born,

44
00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:48.176
and didn't come back 'til I was 18 months old.

45
00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:49.009
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

46
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.930
<v ->And, that generation didn't talk.</v>

47
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.999
But, you know, as you grow older,

48
00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.409
you realize what trauma they went through.

49
00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.306
So, later in life, I've finally come to realize

50
00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:04.809
Dad must have had some horrific experiences.

51
00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.113
The way I put it together, it sort of embittered him.

52
00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:12.410
Religion to him was a non-starter.

53
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.025
So,that was good, from him.
<v Regina>He'd seen</v>

54
00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.220
too many atrocities?

55
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.290
<v ->Yeah, and that benefited me,</v>

56
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.528
in that I didn't go through all that church stuff.

57
00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:27.948
And so, I mean, I'm not religious,

58
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.472
but, it's not a crusade of mine, I just--

59
00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:31.542
<v Regina>Right, but, the thing</v>

60
00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:32.980
that's interesting is--
<v ->I have no interest</v>

61
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.191
in it.
<v Regina>is, so many people</v>

62
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.127
that go through this experience,

63
00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:38.176
they always refer to it as a spiritual experience.

64
00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.010
But, some people cross the line,

65
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.380
and really start applying almost the term

66
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.116
religious experience, in the place of spiritual.

67
00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.785
You know, I have to wonder,

68
00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:48.754
nothing happens by accident.

69
00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:51.190
You've been doing this incredible work,

70
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.527
as a deep academic, in this area.

71
00:02:55.527 --> 00:02:57.461
But, you were drawn to it, obviously,

72
00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:58.363
for other reasons.

73
00:02:58.363 --> 00:03:00.732
There's a deeply spiritual component,

74
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:03.001
to being drawn so deeply into this work

75
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:04.152
that helps people so much.

76
00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:05.204
<v ->Well, by definition.</v>

77
00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:10.204
However, you could equally use that word philosophical.

78
00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:11.639
I went to--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

79
00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.729
<v ->the University of Virginia,</v>

80
00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.680
at the age of 18, in 1962,

81
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.716
planning to be an astronomy major,

82
00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.818
and getting my PhD in astronomy.

83
00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:23.588
But, I'd also been interested in philosophy,

84
00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:28.459
in high school, so when I went to UVA,

85
00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.761
in my first year, I took a philosophy course,

86
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.298
and immediately decided that's what I wanted to do.

87
00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:37.201
And the specific thing that brought me into it

88
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:38.737
was Plato.

89
00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:40.971
And, Plato was the first person

90
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.841
I had ever encountered, at age 18,

91
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.841
who even discussed this notion of an afterlife.

92
00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:51.415
And, the fact that he took it seriously

93
00:03:51.415 --> 00:03:53.117
indicated to me that it was something

94
00:03:53.117 --> 00:03:54.954
you should pay attention to.

95
00:03:54.954 --> 00:03:57.488
So, at the end of Plato's Republic,

96
00:03:57.488 --> 00:04:00.358
which I read at my first semester at UVA,

97
00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:02.527
there's this near-death experience,

98
00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:05.096
and that's what perked my interest.

99
00:04:05.096 --> 00:04:06.665
And then, three years later,

100
00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:09.567
while I was still an undergraduate philosophy student,

101
00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:13.805
in 1965, I met a wonderful man,

102
00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:16.590
who was a professor of psychiatry there,

103
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.978
Dr. George Ritchie, one of my philosophy professors,

104
00:04:19.978 --> 00:04:20.846
told me about him,

105
00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:23.314
and he, some years before,

106
00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:26.076
he had been pronounced dead, twice,

107
00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:27.819
within a 9-minute period,

108
00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.789
and in the interim, had the first of these

109
00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.024
near-death experiences I ever heard.

110
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:35.126
So, to make a long story short,

111
00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:36.595
started investigating it,

112
00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:41.595
got my PhD in philosophy in 1969,

113
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.169
and then, became a philosophy professor,

114
00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.171
and immediately started hearing these

115
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.274
from my students.

116
00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:52.777
So, it's a long process, but that's how it started.

117
00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:54.079
<v Regina>So, over this process,</v>

118
00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:57.315
where was your first personal experience,

119
00:04:57.315 --> 00:04:59.918
with someone, up close and personal,

120
00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:02.386
that had gone through a near-death experience.

121
00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:05.572
What point in this journey and education?

122
00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:06.508
<v ->1965.</v>

123
00:05:06.508 --> 00:05:07.208
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

124
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.592
One of my philosophy professors

125
00:05:08.592 --> 00:05:11.997
told me that, right there in Charlottesville,

126
00:05:11.997 --> 00:05:13.130
was Dr. Ritchie.

127
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.999
He’s a very well-known person,

128
00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.368
in Charlottesville,

129
00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:21.138
and very receptive to talking to student groups,

130
00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:25.029
so in 1965, I heard Dr. Ritchie talk.

131
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:26.587
<v Regina>So, that was your first exposure,</v>

132
00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:27.328
was his experience, or?

133
00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.591
<v ->Well, if you don’t count Plato,</v>

134
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:30.992
<v Regina>Well, yes.</v>
<v ->three years before.</v>

135
00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:32.058
<v ->Yeah, but, what I realized,</v>

136
00:05:32.058 --> 00:05:34.453
from Dr. Ritchie’s experience,

137
00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:36.187
was that it was not just something

138
00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:38.356
pertaining to ancient Greece.

139
00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:39.624
<v Regina>Yes, and then,</v>

140
00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:42.346
through the years, obviously,

141
00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.796
this started taking on a greater and greater focus.

142
00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:47.081
What was the turning point for you,

143
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.001
because you’re also an MD.

144
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:53.087
<v ->Yeah, well, that was long before I was an MD.</v>

145
00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:57.174
The next big, sort of, revolution

146
00:05:57.174 --> 00:05:58.308
in my thinking about it,

147
00:05:58.308 --> 00:06:03.308
was, from 1969 to ‘72, I was Professor of Philosophy

148
00:06:04.282 --> 00:06:07.319
at East Carolina University,

149
00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.554
in Greenville, North Carolina.

150
00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:14.043
And, I began to hear this from my students.

151
00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:17.262
Plato has always been my favorite philosopher

152
00:06:17.262 --> 00:06:22.262
to teach, so when the students got to the point

153
00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:25.269
where Plato talks about the afterlife,

154
00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:26.738
they responded.

155
00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:28.506
So, over the next three years,

156
00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:30.708
I gathered about a dozen of these cases

157
00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:31.576
from my students.

158
00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:33.544
And then, as word spread,

159
00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:38.382
I was invited to various clubs around Greenville,

160
00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:42.353
and I just started collecting these things.

161
00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:44.389
So, when I went to medical school,

162
00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.358
in September of ‘72,

163
00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:49.294
I already had about a dozen cases of this.

164
00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:52.699
I mean, it’s a long, evolutionary process.

165
00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.367
Then, when I started medical school in '72,

166
00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:58.503
I had quite a number of professors

167
00:06:58.503 --> 00:07:00.072
who were very interested in this,

168
00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:02.741
and they would refer cases to me.

169
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:05.009
So, I started talking about this

170
00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.964
at the medical college, in April of ‘73,

171
00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:10.348
during my first year.

172
00:07:10.348 --> 00:07:11.566
<v Regina>April ‘73.</v>

173
00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.850
<v ->Yes, so that was the first--</v>

174
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.086
<v Regina>So, you’re almost, gosh,</v>

175
00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.321
40 years into it, now.

176
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:18.439
<v ->Well, it depends on where you start, yeah, if you start--</v>

177
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.341
<v Regina>Well, yeah, Plato '65.</v>

178
00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:21.588
<v Regina>Yeah, 50 years in '62.</v>

179
00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:23.010
<v ->It was '62, yeah, almost 50 years.</v>

180
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.795
<v Regina>Almost 50 years into it.</v>

181
00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:26.031
So, that’s why they say,

182
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:28.827
"You are the father of near death experience".

183
00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:29.666
<v ->Well, they say that.</v>

184
00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.502
<v Regina>Understanding, that’s the 'they'.</v>

185
00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:32.504
<v ->They say that, but to me, it's like</v>

186
00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:35.741
Plato and the ancient Greek philosophers.

187
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:37.909
The ancient Greek philosophers

188
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:38.810
were into this,

189
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.579
and they called people like this,

190
00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:45.450
who were reputed to return from death,

191
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.419
revenants, and this was a big aspect

192
00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:51.210
of ancient Greek philosophy.

193
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.391
That’s how I got interested in it,

194
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.925
because you can’t really understand

195
00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.094
the origins of Western thought,

196
00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.064
unless you understand about these

197
00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:01.667
early philosophers’ interest

198
00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:04.202
in this very phenomenon that, today,

199
00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:06.070
we call the near-death experience.

200
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.539
<v Regina>Mhm.</v>

201
00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:10.976
<v Regina>When you started encountering</v>

202
00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:12.877
some of these people, early on,

203
00:08:12.877 --> 00:08:14.478
can you give us just a couple of examples,

204
00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:16.090
because we love hearing them.

205
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.830
<v ->Yeah.</v>

206
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.938
<v Regina>Of some of the stories</v>

207
00:08:17.938 --> 00:08:21.331
that just captured you, and gripped you so deeply,

208
00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:26.331
that there was no choice but to continue.

209
00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:29.493
<v ->Well, Dr. Ritchie looms large in that.</v>

210
00:08:29.493 --> 00:08:31.361
<v Regina>Can you share his experience?</v>

211
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:35.633
<v ->Yes, basically, in December of 1943,</v>

212
00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:37.951
at Camp Barkeley, Texas,

213
00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:39.838
he was a recruit into the army,

214
00:08:39.838 --> 00:08:42.274
and during his basic training,

215
00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:44.943
he developed double lobar pneumonia,

216
00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:49.280
and was found, apparently, dead, in the ward,

217
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.883
of double lombar pneumonia.

218
00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:53.851
The doctor came, pronounced him dead.

219
00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:55.086
About nine minutes later,

220
00:08:55.086 --> 00:08:59.790
the ward boy, that was the person he had ever known,

221
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.459
of his age, who had died.

222
00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:03.127
He couldn't face this,

223
00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:06.564
So, he came and persuaded Dr. Francie,

224
00:09:06.564 --> 00:09:09.000
who was the ward physician,

225
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.003
to inject adrenaline,

226
00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:13.104
directly into George's heart.

227
00:09:13.104 --> 00:09:14.972
And, George came back.

228
00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:16.274
But, in the interim,

229
00:09:16.274 --> 00:09:18.576
he said, suddenly, he came to,

230
00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:20.880
and found himself out of his body.

231
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.514
Nobody could see him.

232
00:09:22.514 --> 00:09:23.948
Nobody could hear him.

233
00:09:23.948 --> 00:09:26.484
And, as this experience progressed,

234
00:09:26.484 --> 00:09:29.020
he said the light started getting better.

235
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.388
He found himself surrounded

236
00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:33.824
by a sort of three-dimensional panorama

237
00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:36.194
of everything he had ever done,

238
00:09:36.194 --> 00:09:39.064
and in the presence of this profound being

239
00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:42.767
of complete compassion and love,

240
00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:46.604
and had quite a number of experiences with this.

241
00:09:46.604 --> 00:09:50.375
And then, it greatly shaped his practice of medicine.

242
00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:54.045
After this, he went on to become a physician.

243
00:09:54.045 --> 00:09:55.280
He was only 20 years old,

244
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.381
at the time of his experience.

245
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.117
And, I knew George for the rest of his life.

246
00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:02.453
He was, I can honestly say,

247
00:10:02.453 --> 00:10:05.323
at my age now of 66,

248
00:10:05.323 --> 00:10:08.527
that George Ritchie is the finest human being

249
00:10:08.527 --> 00:10:10.261
I ever have known.

250
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:12.631
Oh, I met him when I was 19,

251
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:15.232
but he totally changed my life.

252
00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:18.202
But, after that, I think, the next one

253
00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:23.202
that was a very significant event to me,

254
00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:28.212
was, some time in late '69, or early '70,

255
00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:32.083
I was a Professor of Psychiatry, at East Carolina.

256
00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:34.651
And, a young man, who had been severely injured

257
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:36.621
in an accident, about a year ago,

258
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:39.807
and had obvious scarring and everything,

259
00:10:40.957 --> 00:10:43.193
made his way up after class, one day,

260
00:10:43.193 --> 00:10:46.897
and asked me, "Why don't we talk about life after death,

261
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:47.832
"in this class?"

262
00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:50.768
and I said, "Why are you interested in that?"

263
00:10:50.768 --> 00:10:53.472
So, this young man said, "Because, about a year ago,

264
00:10:53.472 --> 00:10:55.506
"I was in a bad accident,

265
00:10:55.506 --> 00:10:58.309
"and my doctors said I died,

266
00:10:58.309 --> 00:11:00.311
"and I had an experience

267
00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:02.947
"that has totally changed my life.

268
00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:05.683
"But, I haven't had anybody to talk about it with".

269
00:11:05.683 --> 00:11:07.619
So, I interviewed him,

270
00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:11.155
and, well, anybody who researches this

271
00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:14.993
will know that gathering cases is no problem.

272
00:11:14.993 --> 00:11:16.544
<v Regina>Right, there's so many.</v>

273
00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:18.096
<v ->As soon as you're known for an interest.</v>

274
00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:21.581
So, it just very quickly snowballed.

275
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:27.838
Some time in 1970, toward the Spring,

276
00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:31.043
I was already talking around to campus groups,

277
00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:33.611
on this, and so on.

278
00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:36.748
It was the same thing, as all researchers in this know,

279
00:11:36.748 --> 00:11:39.450
that gathering cases is no problem.

280
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.089
I would go to the local clubs and civic clubs, and so on,

281
00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:46.724
and there were always people there who had it.

282
00:11:46.724 --> 00:11:47.759
<v Regina>Did you find that,</v>

283
00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:49.293
as you were speaking to these groups,

284
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:52.896
at that time, again we're talking 40 years ago, anyway,

285
00:11:52.896 --> 00:11:53.898
<v ->Almost 50.</v>

286
00:11:53.898 --> 00:11:56.219
<v Regina>Yeah, almost 50.</v>

287
00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:58.802
That, there was a certain receptivity,

288
00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.871
in certain types of groups, for example?

289
00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:03.407
Like, were the young kids more receptive,

290
00:12:03.407 --> 00:12:07.544
or did you find, maybe, people who are more aligned

291
00:12:07.544 --> 00:12:09.447
with religions, were more receptive?

292
00:12:09.447 --> 00:12:10.848
Or civics?
<v ->No.</v>

293
00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:12.384
<v Regina>Is it an across-the-board rel...</v>

294
00:12:12.384 --> 00:12:16.521
<v ->Well, this was inherently riveting information.</v>

295
00:12:16.521 --> 00:12:18.129
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

296
00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:21.158
<v ->And, I think the fact that it was being presented</v>

297
00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:23.727
by somebody with a PhD in philosophy

298
00:12:23.727 --> 00:12:25.696
conveyed a little weight.

299
00:12:25.696 --> 00:12:27.398
But, on the other hand,

300
00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:29.834
the experience speaks for itself.

301
00:12:29.834 --> 00:12:32.637
I mean, for example,

302
00:12:32.637 --> 00:12:34.972
when I would go to one of these civic clubs,

303
00:12:34.972 --> 00:12:36.874
and these, at that time,

304
00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:40.761
were an exclusively male province,

305
00:12:42.527 --> 00:12:45.849
and so, these were the movers and shakers,

306
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.918
in this little community.

307
00:12:47.918 --> 00:12:52.918
So, when you open it up to a group,

308
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.928
and the guy who's a well-known businessman,

309
00:12:56.928 --> 00:12:58.229
there, in the community,

310
00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:00.465
acknowledges to the rest of the group,

311
00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:01.766
"Yeah, that happened to me",

312
00:13:01.766 --> 00:13:05.336
it carries its own verification.

313
00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:06.804
<v Regina>It does, because it seems</v>

314
00:13:06.804 --> 00:13:09.106
that it's speaking to something much deeper.

315
00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:11.809
Even when I first read Life After Life,

316
00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:14.111
and then got, at that time, the VHS of it,

317
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:15.579
and shave shared it with--

318
00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.581
<v ->Well, now, I'm a little confused,</v>

319
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:19.918
'cause Life after Life was published

320
00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:23.795
in November of '75.

321
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:25.261
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->But, you're talking about</v>

322
00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:26.390
the film that came much later.

323
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.857
<v Regina>Yeah, the film that came out, right,</v>

324
00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:28.780
because I'd read the book,

325
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.010
and then later got the film.

326
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.757
<v ->Ah, yeah.</v>

327
00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:32.852
<v Regina>And I've shared that with a lot of people</v>

328
00:13:32.852 --> 00:13:35.032
the families of people nearing the end of their journey.

329
00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:36.267
But, the thing is,

330
00:13:36.267 --> 00:13:38.503
I have not experienced a near-death experience.

331
00:13:38.503 --> 00:13:40.037
I've been unconscious, a lot,

332
00:13:40.037 --> 00:13:42.239
but, I haven't experienced that.

333
00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:43.708
Nonetheless, there's something in me,

334
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.243
and Scott and I were talking about this,

335
00:13:45.243 --> 00:13:46.476
on the way here.

336
00:13:46.476 --> 00:13:47.827
Even if you haven't
<v ->It relates to it.</v>

337
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:48.735
been through it,

338
00:13:48.735 --> 00:13:51.082
you feel such a truth, a deep truth, in it,

339
00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:52.650
that it brings people to tears.

340
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.652
And now, of course, you're in the new documentary,

341
00:13:54.652 --> 00:13:56.988
Afterlife, that Paul Perry has produced.

342
00:13:56.988 --> 00:13:57.988
<v ->Uhuh.</v>

343
00:13:57.988 --> 00:14:00.508
<v Regina>And so, this is coming back,</v>

344
00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:01.793
center stage, again.

345
00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:03.661
But, something in each one of us,

346
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:07.097
remembers something about that place

347
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.267
and state of being.

348
00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:11.268
<v ->You know, I think there is,</v>

349
00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:13.637
you're absolutely right-on about that.

350
00:14:13.637 --> 00:14:16.925
Now, I don't know how to account for that.

351
00:14:19.957 --> 00:14:21.313
I do have a hypothesis,

352
00:14:21.313 --> 00:14:22.947
but it takes a long time to explain.

353
00:14:22.947 --> 00:14:24.144
<v Regina>Please go ahead.</v>

354
00:14:24.144 --> 00:14:26.783
If you can do a thumbnail version, please.

355
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:30.121
<v ->Basically, I think it's just an observation</v>

356
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:31.121
of human beings,

357
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:34.425
that certain kind of narratives connect with people,

358
00:14:34.425 --> 00:14:38.596
and stories connect with people, very deeply.

359
00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:41.132
And, it depends on the structure of the story.

360
00:14:41.132 --> 00:14:43.668
For example, screenplay writers will tell you,

361
00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:46.404
there's, they give various numbers, but only, what,

362
00:14:46.404 --> 00:14:49.040
seven to 10 actual stories,

363
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.874
and they get replayed, again and again,

364
00:14:50.874 --> 00:14:54.644
and so, any movie you see is typically

365
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.246
just goes by a pattern,

366
00:14:56.246 --> 00:14:59.115
and they mix up the characters a little bit in the story.

367
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:00.518
But, that's because these things

368
00:15:00.518 --> 00:15:04.121
have a very deep-seated affect on us.

369
00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:08.594
And so, the narratives that give us

370
00:15:08.594 --> 00:15:10.094
the strongest response,

371
00:15:10.094 --> 00:15:11.796
are the ones that are preserved,

372
00:15:11.796 --> 00:15:14.297
and I think that narrative structure,

373
00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:17.568
the story structure, that people give us,

374
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:20.353
when they come back

375
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:23.340
from a near-death experience,

376
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.042
is inherently fascinating.

377
00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:30.042
Because, one thing is that anything that brings

378
00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:33.150
inconsistent elements together

379
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.218
is riveting to the human mind.
<v Regina>True.</v>

380
00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:37.454
<v ->And if you think of a near-death experience,</v>

381
00:15:37.454 --> 00:15:40.625
it's an inherently self-contradictory kind

382
00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:42.359
of mode of expression,

383
00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.624
because, what people tell us is,

384
00:15:44.624 --> 00:15:47.531
first of all, there are no words.

385
00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:52.205
Secondly, that it did not take place in time.

386
00:15:52.205 --> 00:15:55.473
One woman, Vi Horton, my friend of, gosh, many years,

387
00:15:55.473 --> 00:15:56.840
who've had this experience, said,

388
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.676
"Raymond, you could say that my experience

389
00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:00.444
"took one second,

390
00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:03.247
"or you could say that it took 10,000 years.

391
00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:05.417
"It doesn't matter which way you said it".

392
00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:07.785
So, they say, there's no time.

393
00:16:07.785 --> 00:16:10.100
And there's no space.

394
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.624
They say it's not the space that you and I are in.

395
00:16:13.624 --> 00:16:15.092
But, then, what do they tell us,

396
00:16:15.092 --> 00:16:17.194
within those parameters?

397
00:16:17.194 --> 00:16:19.763
They say, "Well, I got out of my body,

398
00:16:19.763 --> 00:16:22.400
"I went through a tunnel, into a light.

399
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.335
"I met my deceased relatives.

400
00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:27.505
"I saw my life pass in review.

401
00:16:27.505 --> 00:16:29.373
"I returned to my body,

402
00:16:29.373 --> 00:16:31.009
"and came back to life".

403
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:32.810
Now, what kind of story is that?

404
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.445
That's a travel narrative, right?

405
00:16:35.445 --> 00:16:39.716
But, the assumptions that we must make,

406
00:16:39.716 --> 00:16:42.686
for a travel narrative to make meaning,

407
00:16:42.686 --> 00:16:45.492
is that there is space and time.

408
00:16:45.492 --> 00:16:47.441
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->So, how can you,</v>

409
00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:49.761
you see it's really,

410
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:53.363
the mind is riveted to that, for two reasons.

411
00:16:53.363 --> 00:16:56.700
Number one, the structure has a self-contradiction.

412
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.102
So, your mind is drawn to something

413
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.438
that is self-contradicted.

414
00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.674
You try to ease the contradiction.

415
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:06.343
So, that part of it is riveting.

416
00:17:06.343 --> 00:17:08.712
Plus, it can raise a great deal of hope.

417
00:17:08.712 --> 00:17:12.215
It leads people to, sort of, hope that there's

418
00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:14.050
something after death.

419
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.686
<v Regina>Well, the response, commonly,</v>

420
00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:19.557
to, when your original film Life After Life came out,

421
00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:23.194
was, people would be moved to tears,

422
00:17:23.194 --> 00:17:26.131
and I'd hear people say, "Ah, I can't wait to die".

423
00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:27.641
(chuckles)

424
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:29.676
I mean, seriously, I've heard a lot of people say that,

425
00:17:29.676 --> 00:17:31.168
"I can't wait to have that experience".

426
00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:32.302
There's something in us,

427
00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.805
that is innately drawn toward that light.

428
00:17:34.805 --> 00:17:36.407
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Or, that source.</v>

429
00:17:36.407 --> 00:17:37.875
Now, one of the things you talk about,

430
00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:40.277
that people come back with,

431
00:17:40.277 --> 00:17:42.580
that seems to be the dominant theme,

432
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.516
is the whole experience of love.

433
00:17:46.516 --> 00:17:47.250
<v ->Yeah</v>

434
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.619
<v Regina>Has been shaped in a new way.</v>

435
00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:49.920
There's a different understanding.

436
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.722
Can you talk about some of that?

437
00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:55.360
<v ->Well, yeah, I think it's pretty obvious</v>

438
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.070
that, if you had an experience in the presence

439
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.314
of a being of complete compassion and love,

440
00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:04.501
you reviewed everything you had ever done,

441
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.762
in an instant,

442
00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:08.706
and that you reviewed the events,

443
00:18:08.706 --> 00:18:10.641
not from the point of view you had

444
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:13.010
when you experienced them,

445
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.247
but rather, from the point of view of the other actors.

446
00:18:17.247 --> 00:18:19.783
For example, people say that if you see yourself

447
00:18:19.783 --> 00:18:23.854
doing an unkind act, in that review,

448
00:18:23.854 --> 00:18:28.259
then you immediately feel the sadness

449
00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:30.394
you brought about in other people's life.

450
00:18:30.394 --> 00:18:33.597
Or, if you see yourself doing something loving,

451
00:18:33.597 --> 00:18:36.133
then you immediately feel the impact the other way,

452
00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:38.202
the good feelings.

453
00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:42.272
So, this brings people to the realization that,

454
00:18:42.272 --> 00:18:44.908
in their words, the most important thing we can do,

455
00:18:44.908 --> 00:18:48.695
while we're alive, is to learn to love.

456
00:18:49.514 --> 00:18:52.116
It doesn't make it that much easier, by the way,

457
00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:53.863
in anybody, you know.

458
00:18:53.863 --> 00:18:55.358
<v Regina>Please, explain that part.</v>

459
00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:56.352
<v ->Well.
<v Regina>'Cause you followed</v>

460
00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:58.223
people, through years, after these experiences.

461
00:18:58.223 --> 00:18:59.890
<v ->Yeah, George Ritchie,</v>

462
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.848
in 1976,

463
00:19:05.162 --> 00:19:06.763
was visiting my house,

464
00:19:06.763 --> 00:19:09.132
and he said, he just sort of dropped by,

465
00:19:09.132 --> 00:19:11.835
for reasons I much later realized,

466
00:19:11.835 --> 00:19:12.970
what it was all about,

467
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.339
but it was atypical of him, to just drop by.

468
00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:18.676
But George did, just drop by.

469
00:19:18.676 --> 00:19:23.213
And, he said,

470
00:19:23.213 --> 00:19:26.182
"Raymond, this experience

471
00:19:26.182 --> 00:19:28.586
"makes your humanity even more of a burden,

472
00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:29.653
"in a way".

473
00:19:29.653 --> 00:19:31.355
And what he was talking about,

474
00:19:31.355 --> 00:19:34.324
was that, even after seeing this vision

475
00:19:34.324 --> 00:19:37.894
of love and so on, you fly off the handle at people,

476
00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:40.263
you say things you wish you hadn't said,

477
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.066
so, it becomes a sort of spiritual discipline,

478
00:19:43.066 --> 00:19:46.303
I think, to always keep that in mind,

479
00:19:46.303 --> 00:19:48.005
which George did, better than anybody

480
00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:49.073
I've ever known.

481
00:19:49.073 --> 00:19:50.941
I'd like to re-emphasize that.

482
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.010
of all the people I've ever known,

483
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.480
George was the finest person.

484
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.682
There are three near-death experiences,

485
00:19:58.682 --> 00:20:02.452
really, that have stayed with me,

486
00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.587
more than any others.

487
00:20:03.587 --> 00:20:06.990
One, George Ritchie, this Vi Horton,

488
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.694
who was a dear friend of mine from,

489
00:20:10.694 --> 00:20:14.631
I think I met Vi

490
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:19.203
in late August of '75,

491
00:20:19.203 --> 00:20:21.372
or no, a little later than that.

492
00:20:21.372 --> 00:20:25.409
It was October of '75.

493
00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:28.612
And then, another was a wonderful man

494
00:20:28.612 --> 00:20:30.647
named Ricky Bradshaw, that I knew.

495
00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.182
<v Regina>And what was that experience like?</v>

496
00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:34.185
<v ->Well, you know, they're all pretty much the same.</v>

497
00:20:34.185 --> 00:20:35.429
<v Regina>They're similar, yeah.</v>

498
00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:36.840
But it's just the memorable characters.

499
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.698
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

500
00:20:38.698 --> 00:20:41.325
<v ->Ricky was essentially cut in two,</v>

501
00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:44.928
in an accident, in Peoria, Illinois.

502
00:20:47.228 --> 00:20:52.228
He was 19 years old, I think he had 40 cardiac arrests.

503
00:20:52.302 --> 00:20:54.805
I talked with his physicians involved in this.

504
00:20:54.805 --> 00:20:57.575
The experience of Ricky Bradshaw

505
00:20:57.575 --> 00:21:00.010
totally changed the lives of the physicians

506
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.178
who were involved in his treatment,

507
00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:05.784
because they couldn't deny all the things he said.

508
00:21:05.784 --> 00:21:09.419
He had this magnificent vision

509
00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:14.382
of going into a place of light, and so...

510
00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:17.053
<v Regina>And he was able to share this, I assume,</v>

511
00:21:17.053 --> 00:21:20.873
over maybe, was it one experience that he had?

512
00:21:20.873 --> 00:21:22.649
Or, did he have numerous--
<v ->Well, it was just</v>

513
00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:24.136
one experience.
<v Regina>during the course,</v>

514
00:21:24.136 --> 00:21:25.508
and he shared it over a period of time

515
00:21:25.508 --> 00:21:26.926
of his recovery, with those around him?

516
00:21:26.926 --> 00:21:29.940
<v ->Yes, and he was in the hospital for 18 months.</v>

517
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.174
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->They told him</v>

518
00:21:31.174 --> 00:21:32.575
he'd never walk again.

519
00:21:32.575 --> 00:21:36.146
Two years later, Ricky climbed a mountain with me,

520
00:21:36.146 --> 00:21:40.417
in Virginia, so he's a remarkable person.

521
00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:41.818
<v Regina>The will that it would take</v>

522
00:21:41.818 --> 00:21:43.486
within his being.
<v ->Yeah, and the kindness.</v>

523
00:21:43.486 --> 00:21:45.058
<v Regina>Did the near-death experience help</v>

524
00:21:45.058 --> 00:21:47.511
with that will to recover and heal?

525
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:49.827
<v ->I don't know, 'cause I only, by definition,</v>

526
00:21:49.827 --> 00:21:52.763
I only knew Ricky after the event,

527
00:21:52.763 --> 00:21:57.763
but yeah, you know, that's the impression

528
00:21:58.334 --> 00:22:00.137
you got, talking with him,

529
00:22:00.137 --> 00:22:04.107
that it was his will to come back,

530
00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:06.242
'cause he had learned in his life review

531
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:09.413
that there were things he needed to complete.

532
00:22:09.413 --> 00:22:11.081
<v Regina>Yeah, and this has to raise the bar,</v>

533
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.423
considerably, to have this experience,

534
00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:14.952
to see where there's an imbalance,

535
00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:17.720
what needs to be tidied up in our relationships,

536
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.990
and come back with, essentially, the same

537
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.127
operating personality.

538
00:22:23.127 --> 00:22:24.661
Like you say, raising the bar,

539
00:22:24.661 --> 00:22:26.263
to try to--
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

540
00:22:26.263 --> 00:22:28.532
It's like George Ritchie really brought that

541
00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:29.499
to my attention.

542
00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:32.003
Because, I mean, I spent many, many hours,

543
00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:34.705
over a long period of time, with George,

544
00:22:34.705 --> 00:22:38.074
and he was one of my best friends in life,

545
00:22:38.074 --> 00:22:41.545
and you know, he constantly emphasized that,

546
00:22:41.545 --> 00:22:45.715
that, you know, you're still burdened with all these...

547
00:22:45.715 --> 00:22:46.683
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

548
00:22:46.683 --> 00:22:47.751
<v Regina>What you were before.</v>

549
00:22:47.751 --> 00:22:48.819
<v ->Failings, and, yeah.</v>

550
00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:50.220
<v Regina>And you're still a human being,</v>

551
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.088
so lest anyone try to jump into this experience,

552
00:22:52.088 --> 00:22:54.491
thinking you're having nothing but bliss.

553
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:55.659
<v ->Oh heavens, no.</v>

554
00:22:55.659 --> 00:22:59.476
<v Regina>Heavens, no.</v>
<v ->Anybody who acts to you</v>

555
00:22:59.476 --> 00:23:00.931
like this made them a saint,

556
00:23:00.931 --> 00:23:02.632
well, you can pretty much think

557
00:23:02.632 --> 00:23:04.835
that they're probably an impostor or something.

558
00:23:04.835 --> 00:23:09.672
And, in all reality, that is one issue

559
00:23:09.672 --> 00:23:11.174
we have to face with this.

560
00:23:11.174 --> 00:23:13.243
I mean, it's wide-out stated accurately,

561
00:23:13.243 --> 00:23:15.378
because anybody can see it,

562
00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:18.849
is that this is a natural draw for impostors, right,

563
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:22.044
who crave attention.

564
00:23:22.044 --> 00:23:25.522
But then, the way you can very readily distinguish

565
00:23:25.522 --> 00:23:27.257
between an impostor and somebody

566
00:23:27.257 --> 00:23:28.658
who really has this,

567
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:32.329
is that, people who really have this are very modest.

568
00:23:32.329 --> 00:23:33.330
Like, if you ask them,

569
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.732
"Do little dogs make it to heaven?"

570
00:23:35.732 --> 00:23:37.801
"Well, you know, I just don't know,

571
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:39.369
"I only saw so much."

572
00:23:39.369 --> 00:23:40.805
<v Regina>Yeah, their experience.</v>

573
00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:41.838
<v ->You know, if there are...</v>

574
00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:42.573
"I don't know."

575
00:23:42.573 --> 00:23:45.242
Whereas, the impostor, whatever you ask them,

576
00:23:45.242 --> 00:23:47.211
"Yes!" or "No!" or whatever.

577
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:48.195
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

578
00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:49.746
<v ->That kind of thing, watch out for,</v>

579
00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:53.516
'cause that kind of individual is bad news.

580
00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:55.419
<v Regina>Okay, and then, the whole notion</v>

581
00:23:55.419 --> 00:23:57.889
about someone becoming, again,

582
00:23:57.889 --> 00:24:00.223
so magnetized to this experience,

583
00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:02.992
because they're resonating with the relief

584
00:24:02.992 --> 00:24:05.029
and the joy, and wanting to connect

585
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:06.863
with something of a loving nature,

586
00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:08.531
that they even go so far,

587
00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:10.133
and I know people who have done this,

588
00:24:10.133 --> 00:24:12.001
who attempt to take their own lives,

589
00:24:12.001 --> 00:24:15.438
just to be able to feel that freedom and release

590
00:24:15.438 --> 00:24:18.509
back into something that they perceive as love.

591
00:24:18.509 --> 00:24:20.645
What happens in that scenario,

592
00:24:20.645 --> 00:24:24.604
with suicide attempts, that do come back.

593
00:24:24.604 --> 00:24:26.750
<v ->Well, by and large, people with suicide attempts</v>

594
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.852
don't have any different experience

595
00:24:28.852 --> 00:24:31.455
from those who come close to death

596
00:24:31.455 --> 00:24:32.990
for other reasons.

597
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.392
But, my experience, as a human being,

598
00:24:35.392 --> 00:24:39.129
as a psychiatrist, is that every adult

599
00:24:39.129 --> 00:24:42.133
that I know well enough to know,

600
00:24:42.133 --> 00:24:45.035
is flirting with suicide in one way or another,

601
00:24:45.035 --> 00:24:47.838
talking on the telephone,

602
00:24:47.838 --> 00:24:49.339
driving down the highway,

603
00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:53.009
or alcohol,

604
00:24:53.009 --> 00:24:55.412
or drugs,

605
00:24:55.412 --> 00:24:58.514
or eating themselves to death,

606
00:24:58.514 --> 00:25:00.050
you know, not doing any exercises.

607
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.935
<v Regina>These are all self-destructive.</v>

608
00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:03.586
<v ->Those are all self-destructive things,</v>

609
00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:06.423
and yet, people full-well know,

610
00:25:06.423 --> 00:25:08.892
or are responsible for knowing,

611
00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:11.962
that, if they continue that behavior,

612
00:25:11.962 --> 00:25:13.162
it's going to kill them.

613
00:25:13.162 --> 00:25:14.430
Well, what's the difference,

614
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.566
between that and somebody who does it?

615
00:25:16.566 --> 00:25:17.734
<v Regina>Takes a few pills.</v>

616
00:25:17.734 --> 00:25:19.202
<v ->Pills, or you know, I mean,</v>

617
00:25:19.202 --> 00:25:21.437
it's a matter of perspective.

618
00:25:21.437 --> 00:25:24.074
God, presumably, is working on a time scale

619
00:25:24.074 --> 00:25:25.975
of billions of years,

620
00:25:25.975 --> 00:25:29.279
and the idea that a divine power

621
00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:35.989
would discriminate,

622
00:25:36.653 --> 00:25:39.775
in other words, this person took 30 years

623
00:25:39.775 --> 00:25:44.662
with cigarettes, this person took a few minutes

624
00:25:44.662 --> 00:25:46.764
with pills, what's the difference?

625
00:25:46.764 --> 00:25:50.433
Now, that said, I will say that one thing

626
00:25:50.433 --> 00:25:53.403
about people with suicidal near-death experiences

627
00:25:53.403 --> 00:25:57.240
is that they tell you that, never again would they

628
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.641
attempt suicide.

629
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:00.410
Because, they learned from their experience

630
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.913
that, even when times are tough,

631
00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:05.882
life has a purpose.

632
00:26:05.882 --> 00:26:07.684
<v Regina>That's beautiful.</v>

633
00:26:07.684 --> 00:26:09.752
That's a beautiful take-away from that.

634
00:26:09.752 --> 00:26:12.255
<v ->Well, it's beautiful, but also, it's reality.</v>

635
00:26:12.255 --> 00:26:13.716
<v Regina>It's reality, yeah.</v>

636
00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:15.926
And those who attempt suicide,

637
00:26:15.926 --> 00:26:17.727
and do not have near-death experiences,

638
00:26:17.727 --> 00:26:19.266
as I recall your saying,
<v ->Yeah.</v>

639
00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:20.753
<v Regina>are move likely to try it again.</v>

640
00:26:20.753 --> 00:26:21.698
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

641
00:26:21.698 --> 00:26:23.867
They have a continued high rate

642
00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:26.870
of subsequent suicide attempts.

643
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.472
<v Regina>So, if you look at this subject,</v>

644
00:26:29.472 --> 00:26:34.423
and let's just say that humanity, as of today,

645
00:26:34.433 --> 00:26:37.481
you can talk about it on the nightly news,

646
00:26:37.481 --> 00:26:38.615
now embraces the fact

647
00:26:38.615 --> 00:26:40.784
that there is a life after life.

648
00:26:40.784 --> 00:26:42.051
How would that change?

649
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:44.525
<v ->I don't think so, I think...</v>

650
00:26:44.525 --> 00:26:45.822
Oh, oh, you mean hypothetically.

651
00:26:45.822 --> 00:26:47.357
<v Regina>No, I'm saying hypothetically.</v>

652
00:26:47.357 --> 00:26:52.195
Let's say that becomes our dominant belief system.

653
00:26:52.195 --> 00:26:54.498
How would that change,

654
00:26:54.498 --> 00:26:58.434
or restructure, the way we interact with each other,

655
00:26:58.434 --> 00:27:00.537
in our society?
<v ->I'm dubious that it would.</v>

656
00:27:00.537 --> 00:27:01.738
I just don't know.

657
00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:04.074
You know, a lot of people get motivated

658
00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:05.942
to investigate this,

659
00:27:05.942 --> 00:27:06.909
because, they say,

660
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:11.909
"Oh, if we could only prove life after death,

661
00:27:12.046 --> 00:27:14.217
"life would be beautiful, everybod...".

662
00:27:14.217 --> 00:27:15.017
I just don't think so.

663
00:27:15.017 --> 00:27:18.488
I mean, I may be wrong, but I don't know.

664
00:27:18.488 --> 00:27:22.543
But, the one thing I do absolutely know,

665
00:27:22.543 --> 00:27:27.097
is that rational proof of an afterlife,

666
00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:28.898
if I could put it that way,

667
00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:33.898
will dramatically restructure the human cognitive system

668
00:27:34.138 --> 00:27:35.539
and the human mind.

669
00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:36.673
And, the way I know that,

670
00:27:36.673 --> 00:27:38.307
is that I've already done it.

671
00:27:38.307 --> 00:27:40.643
I'm in a project now,

672
00:27:40.643 --> 00:27:43.146
which has been ongoing for some years,

673
00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:46.582
but is, sort of, getting ready to come out,

674
00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:49.386
in which, basically,

675
00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:52.021
I'm equipping people

676
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:57.021
with a new logic from within that framework.

677
00:27:58.527 --> 00:28:01.197
There are entirely new ways to research

678
00:28:01.197 --> 00:28:02.465
the question of life after death.

679
00:28:02.465 --> 00:28:04.034
So, basically, what I've done,

680
00:28:04.034 --> 00:28:07.070
is to devise a methodology that,

681
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:11.007
by preparing people,

682
00:28:11.007 --> 00:28:13.310
through an intensive seminar,

683
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.422
with this new system of logic,

684
00:28:16.422 --> 00:28:19.482
what it does is, concurrently with absorbing

685
00:28:19.482 --> 00:28:22.685
this new logic, it recruits new unknown

686
00:28:22.685 --> 00:28:26.156
cognitive faculties of the mind.

687
00:28:26.156 --> 00:28:31.156
Now, that period is the point of this program.

688
00:28:31.895 --> 00:28:34.731
It's to instill a new logic

689
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:37.267
and open new faculties of the mind,

690
00:28:37.267 --> 00:28:41.572
and that is the object of my work, okay?

691
00:28:41.572 --> 00:28:42.706
<v Regina>Mhm.</v>

692
00:28:42.706 --> 00:28:44.941
And the results that come from that

693
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:49.213
are that it enhances people's analytical thinking abilities

694
00:28:49.213 --> 00:28:54.066
that opens up creative channels, and so on.

695
00:28:55.206 --> 00:29:00.206
But, that being the primary object,

696
00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.360
what is also going to happen, out of this,

697
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.096
is that as time progresses,

698
00:29:07.096 --> 00:29:10.067
some of those people who have been through

699
00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:13.070
this preparation, just by chance,

700
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.505
will have near-death experiences.

701
00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:16.373
And, what happens, at this point,

702
00:29:16.373 --> 00:29:18.575
is that when they come back

703
00:29:18.575 --> 00:29:20.543
from their near-death experience,

704
00:29:20.543 --> 00:29:24.915
they have an entirely new way of articulating it.

705
00:29:24.915 --> 00:29:29.915
So, this is the next step in this near-death research,

706
00:29:29.953 --> 00:29:32.656
although, I think it's not going to go over well

707
00:29:32.656 --> 00:29:35.592
with the people who are already set in their ways,

708
00:29:35.592 --> 00:29:37.060
about how to study this.

709
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.897
They will be the last ones to be dragged along.

710
00:29:39.897 --> 00:29:41.464
<v Regina>Always the case, in science.</v>

711
00:29:41.464 --> 00:29:43.699
<v ->It is, it is, but at the same time,</v>

712
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:46.304
it has the virtue of really working,

713
00:29:46.304 --> 00:29:49.672
and of being fully within rational parameters.

714
00:29:49.672 --> 00:29:51.941
So, what I can confidently say,

715
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.778
is that I have made a sort of breakthrough

716
00:29:54.778 --> 00:29:57.747
in rational comprehension of the afterlife.

717
00:29:57.747 --> 00:30:01.284
And I say that, not based on my perceptions of it,

718
00:30:01.284 --> 00:30:03.621
'cause I'm too close to this work.

719
00:30:03.621 --> 00:30:06.522
It actually is something that I've been working on

720
00:30:06.522 --> 00:30:11.028
since 1963, and was part of my doctoral dissertation

721
00:30:11.028 --> 00:30:14.336
in 1969.

722
00:30:14.816 --> 00:30:18.368
But, it does happen to be the future

723
00:30:18.368 --> 00:30:20.270
of near-death studies.

724
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.672
<v Regina>When will this be made available</v>

725
00:30:22.672 --> 00:30:23.474
to the public?

726
00:30:23.474 --> 00:30:24.541
When are you...

727
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:28.778
<v ->Well, that's something I can't say.</v>

728
00:30:28.778 --> 00:30:30.046
I don't know,

729
00:30:30.046 --> 00:30:34.116
because thus far, this work's for people

730
00:30:34.116 --> 00:30:37.186
with a certain very specific profile.

731
00:30:37.186 --> 00:30:41.592
Number one, they just enjoy thinking,

732
00:30:41.592 --> 00:30:43.159
for its own sake.

733
00:30:43.159 --> 00:30:48.159
Number two, they have a knack for reasoning,

734
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:50.467
and analytical thinking,

735
00:30:50.467 --> 00:30:53.236
in other words, they like to analyze things.

736
00:30:53.236 --> 00:30:55.505
Third, that they are patient and persistent,

737
00:30:55.505 --> 00:30:56.939
which is a rare quality,

738
00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:58.875
in the United States, today.

739
00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:01.678
And fourth, that they have a good sense of humor.

740
00:31:01.678 --> 00:31:04.480
But, given people with those criteria,

741
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.400
I can really blow their minds.

742
00:31:08.453 --> 00:31:09.986
Since I'm too close to this work,

743
00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:11.120
after all these years,

744
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.120
I can't make an adequate evaluation of it, myself.

745
00:31:16.155 --> 00:31:18.161
My confidence comes from the fact

746
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:22.214
that I have given this work

747
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:24.167
to professors of engineering,

748
00:31:24.167 --> 00:31:27.270
professors of philosophy,

749
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.439
professors of logic,

750
00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:31.174
professors of psychology,

751
00:31:31.174 --> 00:31:33.142
professors of business,

752
00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:35.411
and so on, and so on, and so on.

753
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:37.147
None of them had a prior interest

754
00:31:37.147 --> 00:31:39.325
in the afterlife question,

755
00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:42.251
and I asked them to evaluate it very harshly,

756
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:43.820
and to find any flaws,

757
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.187
because before I publish it,

758
00:31:45.187 --> 00:31:48.254
you don't want to be taken by surprise, right?

759
00:31:48.254 --> 00:31:49.425
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->I want to know</v>

760
00:31:49.425 --> 00:31:50.763
all the objections, beforehand.

761
00:31:50.763 --> 00:31:51.573
<v Regina>Right.</v>

762
00:31:51.573 --> 00:31:53.162
<v ->But, the most brilliant people I know,</v>

763
00:31:53.162 --> 00:31:56.732
in my life, and the clearest analytical thinkers

764
00:31:56.732 --> 00:32:01.137
have all come back with the unanimous verdict

765
00:32:01.137 --> 00:32:05.108
that it's real.

766
00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:06.976
So, I'm going on that.

767
00:32:06.976 --> 00:32:10.380
And, what I can tell you is that, therefore,

768
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.615
number one, a breakthrough has been made

769
00:32:12.615 --> 00:32:15.785
towards rational comprehension of life after death.

770
00:32:15.785 --> 00:32:18.154
Number two, the last people

771
00:32:18.154 --> 00:32:19.989
who are going to be interested

772
00:32:19.989 --> 00:32:22.092
in this, or who want to accept it,

773
00:32:22.092 --> 00:32:24.361
are the established researchers

774
00:32:24.361 --> 00:32:25.996
in this kind of thing.

775
00:32:25.996 --> 00:32:27.764
Because, all of that,

776
00:32:27.764 --> 00:32:31.167
all the so-called parapsychological thinking and all,

777
00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:34.470
all that is about narrativism as I said.

778
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.642
They just have various ways of telling and retelling

779
00:32:37.642 --> 00:32:39.175
the same old stories,

780
00:32:39.175 --> 00:32:40.376
whereas this is something

781
00:32:40.376 --> 00:32:42.012
that doesn't involve narratives,

782
00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:44.614
but conceptual thinking,

783
00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:46.516
like thinking through,

784
00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:49.786
over a two-day, very intensive period,

785
00:32:49.786 --> 00:32:52.322
a long chain of reasoning.

786
00:32:52.322 --> 00:32:55.458
But when you do, it liberates faculties

787
00:32:55.458 --> 00:32:57.328
of the mind that we haven't,

788
00:32:57.328 --> 00:32:59.896
or that are, obviously, by definition, there,

789
00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.697
but that we've kind of closed off

790
00:33:01.697 --> 00:33:03.866
for about 2300 years.

791
00:33:03.866 --> 00:33:04.717
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

792
00:33:04.717 --> 00:33:06.436
We're not going to bypass the mind,

793
00:33:06.436 --> 00:33:08.738
we definitely need to evolve it.

794
00:33:08.738 --> 00:33:10.172
<v ->Well, open up things that are there,</v>

795
00:33:10.172 --> 00:33:11.506
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>
<v ->potentially.</v>

796
00:33:11.506 --> 00:33:13.709
<v Regina>And this sounds like it's a bridge.</v>

797
00:33:13.709 --> 00:33:16.345
<v ->Well, it is, that's exactly what I call it.</v>

798
00:33:16.345 --> 00:33:19.115
It's a bridge to forever.

799
00:33:19.115 --> 00:33:22.452
And, yeah, and this is so funny to me,

800
00:33:22.452 --> 00:33:24.221
because, being a logician,

801
00:33:24.221 --> 00:33:27.190
that was one of the main things I taught and I studied,

802
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.692
was logic, when I got my PhD,

803
00:33:29.692 --> 00:33:33.096
and so, what is so funny and paradoxical

804
00:33:33.096 --> 00:33:35.632
about this to me, is that I'm quite confident

805
00:33:35.632 --> 00:33:37.033
saying these things.

806
00:33:37.033 --> 00:33:38.801
This is gonna work out.

807
00:33:38.801 --> 00:33:41.404
But, it's gonna be a hard thing to swallow,

808
00:33:41.404 --> 00:33:43.340
for people who are sort of set in their ways

809
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.510
about how to think about these things,

810
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.244
or talk about them.

811
00:33:48.244 --> 00:33:50.614
And, also, it's going to change the format

812
00:33:50.614 --> 00:33:53.783
of how people talk about near-death experiences.

813
00:33:53.783 --> 00:33:55.150
Now, why is that important?

814
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.889
It has to do with what's called parallax.

815
00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:03.226
And that is that, if you asked yourself, for example,

816
00:34:03.226 --> 00:34:05.928
the question, you know, we all know

817
00:34:05.928 --> 00:34:08.464
that it's 4.3 light years, or whatever,

818
00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:12.168
to proxima centauri, or alpha centauri.

819
00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:13.633
Well, you think about it for a minute.

820
00:34:13.633 --> 00:34:16.106
How do they know, right?

821
00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:18.574
I mean, you can't send a homing pigeon out there

822
00:34:18.574 --> 00:34:20.309
with an odometer on its leg.

823
00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:21.210
<v Regina>(laughs) Right.</v>

824
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.145
So, how do they know?

825
00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.348
Well, this came to light in the twenties,

826
00:34:25.348 --> 00:34:26.349
when they realized,

827
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:28.451
they already knew by the neutonian mechanics

828
00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:32.054
at that point, that it's 186 million miles

829
00:34:32.054 --> 00:34:35.681
across the orbit of earth, around the sun.

830
00:34:35.681 --> 00:34:39.295
So, astronomer measured the angle

831
00:34:39.295 --> 00:34:42.198
to certain stars, when the earth was here in its orbit,

832
00:34:42.198 --> 00:34:45.234
waited to six months later, when it was here,

833
00:34:45.234 --> 00:34:47.070
measured the angle again,

834
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.638
and you could see there would be a little difference,

835
00:34:49.638 --> 00:34:52.141
and based on that and the known distance

836
00:34:52.141 --> 00:34:55.077
across the orbit of the earth,

837
00:34:55.077 --> 00:34:58.314
she calculated the distance to nearby stars.

838
00:34:58.314 --> 00:35:00.950
And similarly, if you look at it this way,

839
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:05.950
we already have a large number of reliable cases,

840
00:35:06.055 --> 00:35:07.790
I'll put it that way.
<v Regina>Near-death</v>

841
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.159
experiences.
<v ->Neath death experiences.</v>

842
00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:10.560
Formatted through the framework

843
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.096
of aristotelian logic, and in very short order now,

844
00:35:14.096 --> 00:35:16.966
we're going to have a different way

845
00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.934
of articulating it,

846
00:35:18.934 --> 00:35:21.404
from the framework of this new logic,

847
00:35:21.404 --> 00:35:24.874
so that gives us a triangulation.

848
00:35:24.874 --> 00:35:29.874
So, we're on the verge of major, new,

849
00:35:30.904 --> 00:35:33.082
major progress and rational understanding

850
00:35:33.082 --> 00:35:35.218
of life after death.

851
00:35:35.218 --> 00:35:36.585
<v Regina>Well, on that note,</v>

852
00:35:36.585 --> 00:35:38.154
I'm thrilled.

853
00:35:38.154 --> 00:35:40.806
I can't wait to see what you come up with.

854
00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:42.959
And I know that you're plenty courageous,

855
00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:44.894
because you've been at this a really long time,

856
00:35:44.894 --> 00:35:46.028
to stand up to--
<v ->Oh, no.</v>

857
00:35:46.028 --> 00:35:47.629
It's not courage.
<v Regina>any of those who--</v>

858
00:35:47.629 --> 00:35:48.764
<v ->It's not courage.</v>

859
00:35:48.764 --> 00:35:50.699
You know, it's nice that people say that,

860
00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:51.601
but it wasn't courage.

861
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:52.868
You know, when Life After Life,

862
00:35:52.868 --> 00:35:56.805
I wrote Life After Life in the summer of '74.

863
00:35:56.805 --> 00:35:59.675
The publishers, which were Bantam,

864
00:35:59.675 --> 00:36:03.679
or, the idea, originally, was to send it to Ballantine.

865
00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:06.515
They sat on it for a year,

866
00:36:06.515 --> 00:36:09.952
and then, finally, I persuaded,

867
00:36:09.952 --> 00:36:12.622
in the fall of '75,

868
00:36:12.622 --> 00:36:14.590
I persuaded my publisher, John Eagle,

869
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.392
to publish it himself.

870
00:36:16.392 --> 00:36:17.961
And so, we did.

871
00:36:17.961 --> 00:36:19.462
But you see, some people say,

872
00:36:19.462 --> 00:36:21.297
"Oh, you were so courageous".

873
00:36:21.297 --> 00:36:25.510
Yeah, I wrote it when I was a 3rd year medical student,

874
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.643
and that's balloney.

875
00:36:28.643 --> 00:36:31.807
I was absolutely sure,

876
00:36:31.807 --> 00:36:33.742
when I published that book,

877
00:36:33.742 --> 00:36:35.011
or, when I wrote it,

878
00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:39.715
that anybody who just would ask around among them,

879
00:36:40.855 --> 00:36:43.787
or asked for themselves, around even people they knew,

880
00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:45.956
would be able to find plenty of cases of it.

881
00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:49.392
So, it wasn't courage.

882
00:36:49.392 --> 00:36:51.461
I wasn't afraid at all,

883
00:36:51.461 --> 00:36:53.796
because I knew what the outcome would be,

884
00:36:53.796 --> 00:36:56.665
that anybody who tried it out for themselves

885
00:36:56.665 --> 00:36:58.201
would confirm it.

886
00:36:58.201 --> 00:37:00.703
And similarly, with this new thing,

887
00:37:00.703 --> 00:37:02.939
although it's gonna take a different population,

888
00:37:02.939 --> 00:37:05.542
'cause this is gonna take, initially,

889
00:37:05.542 --> 00:37:07.810
it'll take analytical thinkers, and so on,

890
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.181
who, you know, really enjoy thinking through

891
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:14.483
a very complex case.

892
00:37:14.483 --> 00:37:16.419
But, nonetheless, this will seep out,

893
00:37:16.419 --> 00:37:17.520
and this is real.

894
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.456
We now do have genuine rational progress

895
00:37:20.456 --> 00:37:24.159
toward comprehending the idea

896
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.329
of an afterlife.

897
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:28.865
<v Regina>Good news, we need it.</v>

898
00:37:28.865 --> 00:37:31.433
Any final thoughts?

899
00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:33.269
<v ->No, no.</v>

900
00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:34.804
Just that it's great
<v Regina>I think you've just</v>

901
00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:35.972
said it so beautifully,
<v ->being with you.</v>

902
00:37:35.972 --> 00:37:37.940
<v Regina>I can't wait for the next evolution of your work.</v>

903
00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.008
So, whenever that's out,

904
00:37:39.008 --> 00:37:42.545
I'll be watching, I'll be following you.

905
00:37:42.545 --> 00:37:43.312
And thank you so much.

906
00:37:43.312 --> 00:37:45.347
I really have looked forward to meeting you

907
00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:46.715
for the last 20 years
<v ->Oh, my goodness.</v>

908
00:37:46.715 --> 00:37:48.184
<v Regina>I have.</v>
<v ->What a nice thing,</v>

909
00:37:48.184 --> 00:37:49.519
<v Regina>Truly.</v>
<v ->It's sweet of you.</v>

910
00:37:49.519 --> 00:37:53.539
(Regina chuckles)
Thank you.

911
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.292
<v ->To follow up on Dr. Moody's breakthrough work,</v>

912
00:37:56.292 --> 00:37:57.593
called The New Logic,

913
00:37:57.593 --> 00:37:59.995
do an online search to find out what is required

914
00:37:59.995 --> 00:38:02.031
to attend this two-day intensive workshop

915
00:38:02.031 --> 00:38:03.599
on evolving your intellect.

916
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:05.268
As he said, this is not for everyone,

917
00:38:05.268 --> 00:38:08.070
as it requires the rigorous use of the mind,

918
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.473
along with openness and a sense of humor.

919
00:38:10.473 --> 00:38:15.473
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
