00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:03.253
<v ->It's hard to believe today that Byron Katie was a woman</v>

2
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:06.272
with such low self-esteem that she slept on the floor,

3
00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:09.061
feeling she didn't even deserve to sleep in a bed.

4
00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:11.184
But with one small switch of the mind,

5
00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:12.960
she was set on a path of self inquiry

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.127
that not only healed her life,

7
00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:16.740
but the lives of thousands of others.

8
00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:20.614
Today she lectures and teaches on the subject of inquiring

9
00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:22.363
as to whether our thoughts and feelings

10
00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.923
we experience are true or just a program

11
00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:27.157
we keep running to our own detriment.

12
00:00:27.514 --> 00:00:28.836
Our time with Katie was cut short

13
00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:31.311
due to some nervousness among the conference organizers,

14
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.871
and you will hear voices increasing in the background

15
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.115
as the conference center was filling up.

16
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.765
That said, our time with her was both delightful

17
00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.818
and her words profound; Enjoy.

18
00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:46.393 line:15% 
(light and slow drumming with sitar music)

19
00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Voiceover>A lot of people on our site are involved</v>

20
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.469
in the greatest heights of the mystery

21
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.369
of the new connection between the quantum field

22
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.104
and consciousness and on.

23
00:00:58.644 --> 00:00:59.977
And when it comes right down to it,

24
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.502
perhaps the most complex subject

25
00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.393
we actually have to deal with as human beings

26
00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:07.721
is the subject of our love and inter-connectivity

27
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.566
to each other and what a clear and beautiful

28
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:13.176
job you do in deciphering what this means.

29
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.645
There had to have been a defining moment in your life.

30
00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:17.154
What happened?

31
00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:19.912
<v ->You know, actually, there was.</v>

32
00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:24.022
I was very depressed for more than a decade,

33
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.745
agoraphobic, extremely paranoid, very suicidal.

34
00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.641
And, in fact my self esteem was so low

35
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:32.395
I used to sleep on the floor.

36
00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.485
I didn't believe I even deserved a bed.

37
00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:38.214
And, one morning as I lay sleeping on the floor,

38
00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:42.261
actually a cockroach (laughs) crawled over my foot.

39
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.802
I opened my eyes, you know, I was just startled awake.

40
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.277
In that moment, it has changed my life,

41
00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:55.292
and thousands and thousands, maybe millions of lives.

42
00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Voiceover>What happened when</v>

43
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.432
that cockroach crawled over you?

44
00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:01.600
<v ->I saw in that moment that when I believed my thoughts</v>

45
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.621
I suffered, but when I questioned my thoughts

46
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:07.690
I didn't suffer, and I've come to see

47
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.802
that this is true for every human being.

48
00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:11.598
So that's what my life is about.

49
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.279
<v Voiceover>Your communication</v>

50
00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.041
on this subject is so incredibly clear.

51
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.190
And it's not that it's simple, but it's not easy.

52
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.344
Is that a correct way to say it?

53
00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:25.576
<v ->Well, it's for people who are willing</v>

54
00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:27.415
to take a look at themselves.

55
00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:31.282
For some people they find The Work so much fun.

56
00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:33.586
I call it The Work: the four questions and turnaround.

57
00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:37.207
It's so much fun, because it's entering the world

58
00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:39.258
of ourselves, and it's a universe

59
00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:40.804
that we haven't really tapped.

60
00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:45.804
We think we have, but for me, it's entering heaven.

61
00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:48.504
I've come to see that earth is heaven.

62
00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:52.082
All I've done is question my stressful thoughts.

63
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.537
Anything, any thought, that would lead me to believe

64
00:02:57.537 --> 00:03:01.526
that you are less than I am, that you are not equal

65
00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:04.843
in some way, or that I was not equal in some way to you.

66
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:07.478
That thought needs to be questioned.

67
00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:08.865
Those thoughts need to be questions.

68
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:11.895
It kind of levels that field, and I've come to see

69
00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:16.810
that in our thought systems, I am you and you are me.

70
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.524
People who experience The Work come to see for themselves

71
00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:25.059
that there are no new stressful thoughts.

72
00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:26.783
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

73
00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:30.894
<v ->There just aren't any, and as long as we're stuck in them,</v>

74
00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.387
you know, they're fear based and they're separating.

75
00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:37.395
As long as we're stuck in these thoughts,

76
00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:41.783
believing these thoughts, then we're just not free.

77
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:45.522
<v Voiceover>And you wrote very eloquently in the book,</v>

78
00:03:45.522 --> 00:03:46.940
talking about the simplest thing.

79
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.277
If you're afraid to be alone, if you're afraid

80
00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:53.970
to come home and not turn on the television or the radio,

81
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.615
then you're simply afraid of your own thoughts.

82
00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:57.963
<v ->Exactly so.</v>

83
00:03:58.502 --> 00:04:00.549
<v Voiceover>If I can just add</v>

84
00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.341
one more thing for you to elucidate on.

85
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:06.852
If those are you're thoughts and you're observing them

86
00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:08.551
and listening to them, then who are you?

87
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.172
Can you talk about that whole thing

88
00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:12.170
that we all go through, these loops in our head?

89
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.851
<v Voiceover>Well the loops in our head,</v>

90
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:17.244
this is a fascinating science.

91
00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:21.311
The science of coming to know ourself.

92
00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:26.936
But, if I have the thought, "Look at him. He's unkind."

93
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.231
In that moment, I feel it.

94
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.553
My whole physical can change, if I believe that thought.

95
00:04:34.237 --> 00:04:38.825
In that moment, it's how unkind of me to see him as unkind.

96
00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.215
And then turned around, I see I'm unkind

97
00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.865
to see him that way, and where is it that I'm unkind?

98
00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:48.211
And then I begin to look at him again

99
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:50.077
and the opposite, you know these turnarounds

100
00:04:50.077 --> 00:04:52.253
are what I'm working with, it's a part of The Work.

101
00:04:52.253 --> 00:04:55.810
He is unkind turned around he is kind.

102
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.492
And then my vision immediately begins

103
00:04:58.492 --> 00:05:03.038
to come out of denial and see this man

104
00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:05.484
or this person's life for what it is.

105
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.855
<v Voiceover>So the real barometer</v>

106
00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.548
is how your own thoughts are making you feel.

107
00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:13.333
<v ->Absolutely, if I see you as anything</v>

108
00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:17.243
less than beautiful, I've come to see that

109
00:05:17.243 --> 00:05:19.462
there's no mistake in the universe,

110
00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:21.264
that there absolutely is not

111
00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:24.134
It's not the world that is the problem;

112
00:05:24.134 --> 00:05:26.917
it's what we're believing about the world

113
00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:29.744
that is the problem, and when we question that

114
00:05:29.744 --> 00:05:32.511
the world becomes a beautiful place.

115
00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:35.386
Paradise, actually.

116
00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:36.644
<v Voiceover>When you get into work</v>

117
00:05:36.644 --> 00:05:39.140
like Bruce Lipton, for example The Biology of Belief.

118
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.494
It actually affects the way our own bodies

119
00:05:42.494 --> 00:05:43.780
can heal...
<v ->Yes.</v>

120
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.017
<v Voiceover>It affects our expression</v>

121
00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:46.436
in the world...
<v ->It does.</v>

122
00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.759
<v Voiceover>And it's cultural</v>

123
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.409
<v ->Yes.</v>

124
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.465
<v Voiceover>It's familial.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

125
00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.017
<v Voiceover>We do it to ourselves...</v>

126
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.531
<v ->Yes.</v>

127
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:52.969
<v Voiceover>by our own experience,</v>

128
00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.287
so the line of inquiry has to go pretty deep.

129
00:05:56.287 --> 00:05:59.843
Especially when you get to romantic love.

130
00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:02.281
Can we talk about that? I love the name of your book.

131
00:06:02.281 --> 00:06:03.231
<v ->Yes.</v>

132
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.090
<v Voiceover>I Need Your Love: Is That True? (laughs)</v>

133
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.390
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

134
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.382
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about</v>

135
00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:11.381
what we get ourselves embroiled in?

136
00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:14.033
<v ->Well, if I want to impress you,</v>

137
00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:18.735
then I have to imagine what would impress you.

138
00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:21.808
And then, I have to become that person

139
00:06:21.808 --> 00:06:24.286
that I believe will impress you.

140
00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:27.044
So it's like, she would like me to say this,

141
00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:28.996
or she might like me to do that,

142
00:06:28.996 --> 00:06:30.500
or she might like me to smile.

143
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.220
This is an internal process for some people.

144
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.771
It's going on all the time.

145
00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:37.230
So, I want you to care about me,

146
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.480
so I begin to perform.

147
00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:43.024
I become a facade.

148
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.574
Then, when you say, "Oh I really like her. She's wonderful."

149
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.760
or you say, "Katie, I really like you.

150
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.139
"You're such a wonderful person."

151
00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.904
then I cannot believe you, because the person

152
00:06:55.904 --> 00:06:57.833
you're liking doesn't exist.

153
00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:02.833
It's one that I have concocted in my belief system

154
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.476
of what you would appreciate and admire.

155
00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:10.737
So, I'd like to say if I had a prayer it would be this:

156
00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:13.415
God, spare me from the desire to seek

157
00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:16.652
love approval or appreciation. Amen.

158
00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:18.066
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Yes.</v>

159
00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.669
<v ->And it leaves me as my authentic self.</v>

160
00:07:19.824 --> 00:07:23.387
When you say, "I care about you. I think you're wonderful."

161
00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:27.026
I can own it 100%,

162
00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:30.680
because I haven't attempted

163
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.284
to manipulate your mind.

164
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:34.797
<v Voiceover>Right, so how does life feel</v>

165
00:07:34.797 --> 00:07:36.685
at that point when you decide you're no longer

166
00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:38.764
manipulating people...
<v ->Authentic.</v>

167
00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.547
<v Voicover>to like you?</v>
<v ->Authentic.</v>

168
00:07:41.547 --> 00:07:42.583
<v Voiceover>What is it we're afraid of?</v>

169
00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:45.691
What is it we feel we have to risk in being authentic?

170
00:07:46.826 --> 00:07:49.663
<v ->We're afraid, you know, if we look at the self talk,</v>

171
00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:52.245
some people will have thoughts like

172
00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:54.644
"I'm not enough. There's something wrong with me.

173
00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:58.323
"I did it wrong." and we're so full of this guilt and shame,

174
00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:01.640
we think if we're ourself that people will see us

175
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.863
the way we believe that they'll see us,

176
00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:10.863
which is not living up to their expectations

177
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.717
and really it's our expectations.

178
00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:15.131
<v Voiceover>What about the whole</v>

179
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.347
if you love me you'll do what I want game?

180
00:08:21.832 --> 00:08:26.617
<v ->It's simply, what I like to say is:</v>

181
00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:29.828
Personalities don't love, they want something.

182
00:08:29.828 --> 00:08:34.828
We equate that with love; getting and having and giving.

183
00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:38.769
We equate that as love, and I've come to see that it's not.

184
00:08:39.575 --> 00:08:41.137
I like to say that...

185
00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:45.179
I used to say my name is Yes.

186
00:08:45.218 --> 00:08:46.209
(Interviewer laughs)

187
00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:47.819
<v ->Because someone would ask me</v>

188
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.545
a question or for something and I would say yes.

189
00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:52.790
And that's a yes to me, it feels right.

190
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.987
But, when my integrity says no,

191
00:08:54.987 --> 00:08:58.315
this integrity is what I answer to inside me,

192
00:08:58.315 --> 00:09:00.826
because I'm who I live with.

193
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:04.107
So, when it's honest, I say no.

194
00:09:04.107 --> 00:09:06.670
And that no, is a yes to me.

195
00:09:07.071 --> 00:09:09.268
So, I'm not dealing with pleasing people.

196
00:09:09.268 --> 00:09:12.056
I'm dealing with my own authenticity.

197
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:15.850
At first, it can be hard for people

198
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.206
to step into that honest place, because they believe

199
00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:21.395
they'll lose friendships, the love of their children,

200
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.592
the love of their spouses and partners,

201
00:09:23.592 --> 00:09:25.373
and it's a very fearful thing.

202
00:09:25.373 --> 00:09:29.388
It's like if I'm really authentic, people won't like me.

203
00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:33.834
But, I invite everyone to question that also,

204
00:09:35.099 --> 00:09:37.184
until you love who you're with.

205
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:40.528
<v Voiceover>What happens when, say you're with someone</v>

206
00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:43.611
whether it be family, friends, husband, wife,

207
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:47.003
where you have certain preferences for example.

208
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.602
These are your preferences.
<v ->Yes.</v>

209
00:09:48.602 --> 00:09:51.184
<v Voiceover>And you just simply in a sense,</v>

210
00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:53.605
don't match each other's preference list

211
00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:57.939
when you start stripping away the need to be approved of.

212
00:09:58.543 --> 00:10:00.905
How does one then begin dealing with that?

213
00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:04.911
What's that end up feeling like too?

214
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:07.984
<v ->Let's say my preference, and I live this everyday,</v>

215
00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:11.268
and my husband does also, but let's say

216
00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:16.056
my preference is to go to a movie.

217
00:10:16.056 --> 00:10:18.824
And his preference is to go for a walk.

218
00:10:19.747 --> 00:10:22.350
He says, "I want to walk.", and I say,

219
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.896
"Well, I would like to go to a movie."

220
00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:26.979
Now, he's free to take his walk, and I'm free

221
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:30.482
to go to the movie, because it has nothing to do with love.

222
00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:33.710
It has to do with preferences.

223
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.120
He understands it's not because I don't love him

224
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.603
that I'm not walking with him.

225
00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:41.148
And we both understand the same thing.

226
00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:46.039
Now, if he says, "I want you to go for a walk with me.

227
00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:48.236
"It's very very important to me."

228
00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:52.124
So, I open my mind and I think well why not?

229
00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:53.665
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

230
00:10:53.665 --> 00:10:55.195
<v ->Why not?</v>

231
00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.053
There's no mistake; I can't do it wrong.

232
00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:00.831
So, what would I learn on this walk?

233
00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:04.831
A whole world opens up, so when I'm taking the walk,

234
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.534
I enter, someone I love, I enter their world.

235
00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:12.606
I get to see what it is about the walk that they love,

236
00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:14.323
what it is about the walk I love.

237
00:11:14.323 --> 00:11:16.967
But, if my mind is at the movie,

238
00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:21.788
or how he convinced me, it's very important

239
00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:26.610
for me to understand that he did not

240
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.444
manipulate me to take that walk.

241
00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:30.875
That I made the decision.

242
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.198
<v Voiceover>And this is really critical,</v>

243
00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:33.819
to not succumb to manipulation,

244
00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:38.608
but rather really truly make your choices

245
00:11:38.608 --> 00:11:40.010
and live with those choices.

246
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.721
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

247
00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:42.106
<v Voiceover>And that's where the power comes from.</v>

248
00:11:42.106 --> 00:11:45.375
<v ->Yes, it's like his preference became my preference.</v>

249
00:11:46.191 --> 00:11:49.092
For whatever reason, I own it. I own it.

250
00:11:49.092 --> 00:11:50.351
He did not make me do it.

251
00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:52.688
Like if someone says, "Katie, touch your nose."

252
00:11:52.688 --> 00:11:55.674
And I touch it, I can't say they made me do it.

253
00:11:56.744 --> 00:11:58.024
I made the decision.

254
00:11:58.061 --> 00:11:59.235
<v Voiceover>So, the truth is when you take</v>

255
00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:01.954
your own power back to say yes to yourself,

256
00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:05.559
yes to be honest with what you truly desire,

257
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:08.205
what you need, who you are, what you are,

258
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:10.626
doesn't that give you power then

259
00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.889
to really accept others in the world more unconditionally?

260
00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:15.455
I mean truly.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

261
00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:19.592
Absolutely, we can only project our thoughts onto people.

262
00:12:19.592 --> 00:12:21.639
Everything is our projection.

263
00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:24.353
Every thing, everyone, every situation.

264
00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:28.081
And if we don't love those people in situations,

265
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.311
then that's where I invite people to question

266
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:33.223
their thoughts about those situations and people,

267
00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:36.411
and to wake themselves up to a world

268
00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:40.437
that is indescribably kind.

269
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:42.832
<v Voiceover>I have one quick question.</v>

270
00:12:42.832 --> 00:12:45.776
For a woman who was afraid of sleeping in a bed

271
00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:47.845
because you didn't deserve one, you're about to pack

272
00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:49.904
this convention center, and we can hear the people

273
00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:51.930
in the background streaming in right now.

274
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.840
One quick question, and I know it's not quick,

275
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.303
but if you can bullet points and then they can buy the book,

276
00:12:56.303 --> 00:12:59.338
what are the five keys to freedom and love?

277
00:12:59.994 --> 00:13:01.786
<v ->Okay, you know, what I would love to do</v>

278
00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:03.674
is talk about five things?
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

279
00:13:03.674 --> 00:13:06.841
<v ->Okay, the four questions and the turnaround.</v>

280
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:08.880
I love that people know what these are...

281
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.711
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

282
00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:10.863
<v ->And they're on my website,</v>

283
00:13:10.863 --> 00:13:12.814
you don't have to remember them.

284
00:13:12.814 --> 00:13:15.481
They're always there on the home page free.

285
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:19.598
The first one, and we put these up against a belief

286
00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:22.457
that something that is stressful for us,

287
00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:26.371
like "He doesn't care about me", "She doesn't care about me"

288
00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:28.482
for example, or "I'm not enough."

289
00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:31.567
But, the first question is: Is it true?

290
00:13:31.968 --> 00:13:32.864
The second question is:

291
00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:35.290
Can you absolutely know that it's true?

292
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.229
The third question is: How do you react

293
00:13:38.229 --> 00:13:40.633
when you believe that thought?

294
00:13:41.311 --> 00:13:42.943
What happens when you believe that?

295
00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:46.601
Yeah, how does that feel and where does the mind travel?

296
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:48.307
How do you treat yourself and other people

297
00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:49.950
when you believe that thought?

298
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.752
How do you react when you believe the thought?

299
00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Voiceover>If it's badly, then you need to examine</v>

300
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.825
that thought. (laughs)

301
00:13:54.825 --> 00:13:56.159
<v ->Yes, if it's stressful.</v>

302
00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:59.708
Then the fourth question is:

303
00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:01.959
Who would you be without that thought?

304
00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:03.057
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

305
00:14:03.057 --> 00:14:04.262
<v ->Who would you be?</v>

306
00:14:04.262 --> 00:14:06.001
You can take it back later, but be still

307
00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:08.038
and answer the question.

308
00:14:08.038 --> 00:14:09.521
To be still with all four of these questions.

309
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:13.744
And then, as we did with the unkind man example,

310
00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:16.016
I invite people to turn the thought around

311
00:14:16.016 --> 00:14:19.291
and find opposites, and see if they're as true or truer.

312
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.265
Find examples so that you can step into

313
00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:25.427
what is authentically yours.

314
00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:27.889
<v Voiceover>Katie, thank you so much.</v>

315
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:29.525
I could talk to you for days, but we don't have

316
00:14:29.525 --> 00:14:31.919
the time to do that, so I'll encourage everybody

317
00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:34.400
to read your book, and also, I know you have some

318
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.288
fabulous connections coming up

319
00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:37.770
with PBS and some other things.

320
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.575
You really are changing the lives of millions,

321
00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:42.078
and thank you for your time.

322
00:14:42.078 --> 00:14:44.536
<v ->You're so welcome. It's a privilege.</v>

323
00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:47.415
(light and slow drumming)

324
00:14:47.944 --> 00:14:49.159
<v ->There's little doubt that this kind</v>

325
00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:51.111
of self inquiry is justified in much

326
00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:53.287
of what we do and experience in our lives.

327
00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:55.218
Katie's books are available by clicking

328
00:14:55.218 --> 00:14:57.511
on the link below if you would like to know more.

329
00:14:57.511 --> 00:14:59.803
Now, for those of you already ready to take a look

330
00:14:59.803 --> 00:15:01.393
at your thoughts and communication,

331
00:15:01.393 --> 00:15:04.433
you can also turn to the work of Robert Tennyson Stevens,

332
00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:07.281
who is a master in the arena of the spoken word

333
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.030
and its impact on our lives.

334
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.483
You can see interview here on CMN as well.

335
00:15:11.483 --> 00:15:13.771
Until next time, thanks for watching.

336
00:15:14.373 --> 00:15:18.132
