(bright music)

2
00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.796
<v ->In our previous interviews with Dr. Harvey Bigelsen</v>

3
00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:10.268
we spoke of the damage done

4
00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:12.424
to the body's immune system from surgery.

5
00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:14.257
In this conversation we speak

6
00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:16.028
about how the medical establishment

7
00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:18.183
uses its power to keep new and alternative

8
00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:20.124
treatments away from their client base.

9
00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.129
Through coercion, legal witch hunts.

10
00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.708
and law making.

11
00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.244
Harvey knows this all too well

12
00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:26.801
and he has written a book titled

13
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.593
"The Medical Conspiracy in America".

14
00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:29.959
In addition we talked about some

15
00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:32.412
exciting new news on stem cell therapy.

16
00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:35.932
Harvey it's so good to see you again.

17
00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:37.660
Everything moves on,

18
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.729
your work has moved on and progressed

19
00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.458
in the last couple of years since we spoke.

20
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.953
And I just want to set this interview up

21
00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:47.559
with some really glaring realities.

22
00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.609
So that people understand the beginning point,

23
00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.697
which is

24
00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:54.193
and correct me on this.

25
00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:57.115
Patient care is the what,

26
00:00:57.115 --> 00:00:58.353
number one or number two

27
00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:01.019
leading cause of death in the United States?

28
00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.406
<v ->Actually it's number three.</v>

29
00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:05.436
200,000 people die a year from doctor's mistakes.

30
00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.206
<v Regina>Okay, number three,</v>

31
00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:09.937
the third cause of death in the United States then.

32
00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.579
This is significant.

33
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.201
This is something we need to have

34
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.886
brazened in our mind.

35
00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:16.848
As we tend to give our power away

36
00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:18.896
to these experts that are called doctors.

37
00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:22.581
That they kill a quarter of a million people a year.

38
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.019
And it could be drug interactions

39
00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.875
because they simply don't know

40
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.198
what the effects could be.

41
00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:29.990
It could result from problems in surgery.

42
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.547
It could be negligence.

43
00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:32.656
It could be any number of things.

44
00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:34.022
But the point is we really need

45
00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:35.963
to start questioning who these experts are.

46
00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:39.056
If they're the third leading cause of death

47
00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:40.421
in this country.

48
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:42.256
<v ->Oh, without question, to me,</v>

49
00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:44.432
first of all, I'm an MD.

50
00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:47.221
MDs learn nothing about health.

51
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.019
I had not one minute of nutrition

52
00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:50.363
in medical school.

53
00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:51.408
Not one minute of structured

54
00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:52.581
medical school, not one minute of

55
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.907
health in medical school.

56
00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.997
<v Regina>Of health?</v>

57
00:01:56.997 --> 00:01:58.725
<v ->Not one minute of health in medical school.</v>

58
00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:01.919
All you're taught is disease management.

59
00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:03.577
<v Regina>Disease management, yeah.</v>

60
00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:05.082
<v ->That's it. And the cause of disease,</v>

61
00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:06.470
you're not taught anything.

62
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.793
First year they're normal,

63
00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.522
Second year you have the diseases.

64
00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:11.803
I remember asking my professors,

65
00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:14.320
"How did we get from a normal colon to colitis?"

66
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.451
And their answer was,

67
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.370
"Don't ask questions, just read the book

68
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.796
"and put those answers down."

69
00:02:20.122 --> 00:02:22.555
And straightforward, "How do you get from one to the other?"

70
00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:24.496
<v Regina>So is it any surprise so many people</v>

71
00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.799
die under the care of someone who

72
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.741
hasn't really been trained in wellness,

73
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.597
the understanding of disease,

74
00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:32.325
the understanding of health?

75
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:35.034
And secondly, or thirdly, the

76
00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.445
understanding of chronic disease.

77
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:39.748
And this is an area where medicine really

78
00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:41.583
falls down, they really can't do a darn thing

79
00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:43.524
to quote, cure it.

80
00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:47.044
<v ->Outside of crisis medicine they haven't</v>

81
00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:49.961
cured one chronic disease in 100 years.

82
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.039
In 1910 Rockefeller gave actually the power

83
00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.597
to the medical establishment,

84
00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:58.389
since then not one chronic disease in 100 years.

85
00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:01.039
Now if your car transmission failed.

86
00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.724
And you went to the mechanic,

87
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.047
and the mechanic said he'd never

88
00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:05.625
fixed a transmission in his life.

89
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.629
A, would you leave the car there?

90
00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.545
Of course not.

91
00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:09.359
B, would you ask him his expert advice?

92
00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.335
<v Regina>No.</v>

93
00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.297
<v ->Well why do we do that with the MDs?</v>

94
00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:16.137
<v Regina>And yet we're completely brainwashed</v>

95
00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:20.611
in the western world to trust only our doctor.

96
00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.177
And that's why I wanted to talk to you,

97
00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:25.929
the book now, "Medical Conspiracy in America"

98
00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.596
that you've printed that's available freely online

99
00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:30.217
for anybody to see what the system,

100
00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:32.457
how it's actually rigged.

101
00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:34.548
We need to start exploring

102
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.425
how it is that people doing

103
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.516
really fine work in healing

104
00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:40.692
and actually curing chronic diseases.

105
00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:43.785
In the 19th century, the 20th century,

106
00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:47.795
were literally run out of business by the AMA.

107
00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:49.523
Just to begin that story

108
00:03:49.523 --> 00:03:51.391
and to look at how this progressed

109
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:52.737
in your own story.

110
00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:54.195
This is as much, this about your own story,

111
00:03:54.195 --> 00:03:56.869
because you exemplify how this is managed

112
00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.619
to the point where we don't trust anyone

113
00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.946
except a classic MD doing allopathic medicine,

114
00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:03.802
and this is totally by design.

115
00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:06.960
<v ->It's brainwashing, I call it Orwellian propaganda.</v>

116
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.816
All you hear on the news every night,

117
00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:10.672
experts say this, experts say that

118
00:04:10.672 --> 00:04:13.061
if you're a failure for 100 years,

119
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.960
how can you be an expert?

120
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.544
And all we're doing, medicine today

121
00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:20.570
reminds me of the moron that lost a quarter

122
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.872
on a dark night and is looking

123
00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:23.237
two blocks down the street

124
00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:25.178
cause that's where the street lamp is.

125
00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:27.351
<v Regina>(laughing) Okay, I get it.</v>

126
00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:29.975
So let's go back to some of the roots of it.

127
00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:31.874
And get into the story of the conspiracy.

128
00:04:31.874 --> 00:04:33.367
The medical conspiracy, and

129
00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:34.967
I've taken some notes here.

130
00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.506
What, 1847 AMA was formed,

131
00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.319
but one of the things that really intrigued me

132
00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.839
within that was there was a propaganda department.

133
00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:46.337
Tell us about the AMA propaganda department,

134
00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:49.809
and Dr. Arthur Kent, how did this whole thing begin?

135
00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:51.921
<v ->Well, you know, first of all,</v>

136
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:54.865
there are five licensed healthcare professionals

137
00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:56.102
in the state of California.

138
00:04:56.102 --> 00:04:57.852
You got MDs, osteopaths, chiropractors,

139
00:04:57.852 --> 00:04:59.814
naturopaths, and acupuncturists.

140
00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:02.331
The only one that organized in 1847,

141
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.931
the AMA organized.

142
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:05.937
They wanted to control the system.

143
00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:07.025
Now I'm not sure,

144
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:08.113
I don't know that Kent,

145
00:05:08.113 --> 00:05:10.011
but I do know that they set up

146
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:12.123
a propaganda system.

147
00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:15.131
And that's exactly so much of what we are

148
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:16.966
is a propaganda system.

149
00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:18.331
Every night on TV.

150
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:20.507
You'll see, "experts say this, experts say that."

151
00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:22.960
You got pharmaceutical commercials

152
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.688
telling you go to see your doctor this,

153
00:05:24.688 --> 00:05:26.118
go to tell your doctor that.

154
00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:29.360
It's a brainwashing, it's a constant brainwashing.

155
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.560
MDs know nothing about health.

156
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.096
Zero.

157
00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:35.952
Again, the cure rate is zero.

158
00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:38.747
The United States is 37th in the world

159
00:05:38.747 --> 00:05:40.923
in healthcare longevity.

160
00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:43.824
What makes us so good with

161
00:05:43.824 --> 00:05:45.296
such a failure, in 100 years,

162
00:05:45.296 --> 00:05:47.024
you think someone would wake up.

163
00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:50.053
But I look for the truth,

164
00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:53.552
for me my oath is to the patient.

165
00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:57.349
And I do my best, and I remember one case

166
00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.016
that I fixed, and I had charges brought

167
00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:01.979
against me by the Arizona Medical Board

168
00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.602
that I cured a person with illegal means.

169
00:06:04.602 --> 00:06:07.354
I mean, think of that concept.

170
00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Regina>I know, the book.</v>

171
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.280
People need to go ahead and download this book.

172
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.240
and read it.

173
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.818
They need to find out how the system is working.

174
00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:15.760
We're going to kind of take them through,

175
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.085
kind of do a little hop scotch through it.

176
00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:19.741
<v ->By the way, another thing that I want to do,</v>

177
00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:22.003
look up Quack Watch and my name.

178
00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:23.880
Right on the first page you'll see

179
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.907
I was censored, and they bring up

180
00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:29.165
the papers for illegible handwriting.

181
00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:31.133
<v Regina>I saw that, illegible handwriting.</v>

182
00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:34.547
(laughter) Okay, so we got in the middle

183
00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:36.509
of the 19th century, the AMA comes along.

184
00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.323
And first of all when the AMA organized,

185
00:06:38.323 --> 00:06:40.989
what were some the effects of that

186
00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:43.954
in terms of the other areas of medicine

187
00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:46.002
that were licensed that you already spoke of.

188
00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:46.962
What happened?

189
00:06:46.962 --> 00:06:48.072
What really happens,

190
00:06:48.072 --> 00:06:50.760
is the effective it really takes place in 1910,

191
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.064
with Rockefeller, okay?

192
00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:54.834
The germ, fear of disease, come up

193
00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:57.502
in the mid-1800's by Pasteur,

194
00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:00.317
his rival said germs don't cause disease,

195
00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:03.197
Antoine, said they can live in a diseased body

196
00:07:03.197 --> 00:07:05.458
Pasteur on his death bed recants,

197
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.738
and says he's wrong.

198
00:07:06.738 --> 00:07:08.978
However though, if you have

199
00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:10.258
the germ theory disease,

200
00:07:10.258 --> 00:07:11.922
you can develop the magic bullet

201
00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:13.693
philosophy of therapy.

202
00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:17.703
Rockefeller in 1910 sponsored the medical establishment.

203
00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:20.911
In 1910 there's essentially five professions.

204
00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:22.618
And they're all basically equal

205
00:07:22.618 --> 00:07:24.730
until Rockefeller steps in.

206
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.632
He supports the medical establishment.

207
00:07:27.632 --> 00:07:30.511
All the other schools lose their charter,

208
00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:33.178
by 1947, Flower Fifth Ave of New York

209
00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:35.524
is the last one that becomes a medical school,

210
00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:37.296
it was a homeopathic school.

211
00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:40.026
John Rockefeller died at the age of 97

212
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.052
a vegetarian all his life, never taken

213
00:07:42.052 --> 00:07:43.716
a drug into his mouth and a

214
00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:46.148
homeopathic physician in attendance.

215
00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:47.897
<v Regina>Yeah, and this is a "follow the money" story.</v>

216
00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:49.583
And we talked about this in the last interview.

217
00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:50.735
Follow the money.

218
00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:51.844
<v ->It's all money.</v>

219
00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:53.252
<v Regina>They made massive amounts of money</v>

220
00:07:53.252 --> 00:07:54.361
in the pharmaceutical industry.

221
00:07:54.361 --> 00:07:56.025
So Rockefeller, when he intervened and

222
00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:58.671
started funding in essence medical schools,

223
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:01.252
the other schools were essentially shut down.

224
00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:02.724
<v ->They were all shut down.</v>

225
00:08:02.724 --> 00:08:04.431
They all lost their charters

226
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.052
and that was basically it.

227
00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.910
They all became secondary by the propaganda.

228
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.702
<v Regina>By the propaganda,</v>

229
00:08:10.702 --> 00:08:12.430
because by this time we're looking at

230
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.076
some collusion between governmental agencies

231
00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:17.444
as the decades progressed, and also

232
00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:20.025
with the media and the funding of advertising

233
00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:22.414
for the media, which comes directly from

234
00:08:22.414 --> 00:08:24.889
these same institutions and these same

235
00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:27.385
mega corporations and media conglomerates.

236
00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:28.835
<v ->It's all media control.</v>

237
00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:30.841
<v Regina>Which all that have to do with</v>

238
00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:31.979
the American Pharmaceutical Association.

239
00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.089
It's all in bed together?

240
00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:33.946
<v ->It's all media controlled.</v>

241
00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.435
Pharmaceutical industries makes a fortune

242
00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:39.016
during our bad economy the pharmaceutical

243
00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:41.079
industry is increasing.

244
00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:42.451
Go to a drug store,

245
00:08:42.451 --> 00:08:43.816
that's the only place with lines.

246
00:08:43.816 --> 00:08:45.395
<v Regina>Well sure, because people are</v>

247
00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:46.675
so anxious you have to have

248
00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:48.680
your anti-anxiety drug because you

249
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.088
just lost your job, of course.

250
00:08:50.088 --> 00:08:51.603
<v ->Right, and all of these drugs</v>

251
00:08:51.603 --> 00:08:54.077
that they give you, realize they're all poisons.

252
00:08:54.077 --> 00:08:56.253
There's no such thing as a side effect.

253
00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:57.811
That makes it sound like it may not happen.

254
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.941
It's a direct effect.

255
00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:01.906
So you will have those negative effects

256
00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:03.698
if you take in a poison.

257
00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:04.808
And now the average person

258
00:09:04.808 --> 00:09:06.685
is taking five to seven a day.

259
00:09:06.685 --> 00:09:08.434
Because every specalist

260
00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:10.205
is giving someone a different poison.

261
00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:11.442
<v Regina>And no one knows what the other</v>

262
00:09:11.442 --> 00:09:13.106
one is giving them, there's no real management

263
00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:15.752
in terms of contraindications of all these drugs

264
00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:17.053
people are taking.

265
00:09:17.053 --> 00:09:18.184
<v ->There is no discussion.</v>

266
00:09:18.184 --> 00:09:19.144
Doctors are not talk to,

267
00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:20.829
the pulmonologist doesn't talk to the cardiologist

268
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:22.941
and they may be in the same office,

269
00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:25.437
each one giving different medicines.

270
00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:27.783
<v Regina>That's dangerous, that's irresponsible.</v>

271
00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:30.109
<v ->It's so dangerous it's so scary.</v>

272
00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:32.135
You have no such thing as a side effect.

273
00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:33.821
These are direct effects

274
00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:35.975
that are negative and they are poisons.

275
00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:40.967
<v Regina>So the AMA has managed to manage</v>

276
00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:45.106
the impressions of Americans that we should

277
00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:46.661
be dependent only on them,

278
00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:48.175
because everyone else other than

279
00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:50.991
their sanctioned few which offer drugs and surgery

280
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.485
are quacks.

281
00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:53.530
<v ->Correct.</v>

282
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.746
<v Regina>And there was a committee</v>

283
00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:56.111
on quackery that was established what

284
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:59.098
in 1963 and they started going after

285
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:02.746
the remaining and those bold enough to

286
00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:05.391
still enter the field of osteopathy

287
00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:07.951
or chiropractic and so forth.

288
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:10.276
<v ->Naturopathy, acupuncture, all of those.</v>

289
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.452
<v Regina>So what happened after that committee</v>

290
00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:13.988
was established, the committee on quackery?

291
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.356
<v ->Well that's when, the committee on quackery,</v>

292
00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:18.020
that's what set me up too.

293
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.130
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

294
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.178
<v ->And it brought in the insurance companies,</v>

295
00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:23.204
and then they start to spy on you with

296
00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:24.954
the insurance codes.

297
00:10:24.954 --> 00:10:26.660
<v Regina>How does that work?</v>

298
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.988
You were doing homeopathy.

299
00:10:29.988 --> 00:10:32.441
<v ->I practiced, yeah, I'm an MD.</v>

300
00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:33.935
I have an MD license.

301
00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:35.492
Just because I give a homeopathic remedy

302
00:10:35.492 --> 00:10:37.604
is one thing versus a prescription is another thing.

303
00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:41.508
What they did is actually they took

304
00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:44.047
the people like me,

305
00:10:44.047 --> 00:10:46.777
and they started to categorize them,

306
00:10:46.777 --> 00:10:48.569
put them into the videos.

307
00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:50.126
They started to smear them,

308
00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:54.472
unless it is drug medicine, you have to be a quack.

309
00:10:55.332 --> 00:10:58.745
Alternative means to me, secondary.

310
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.537
<v Regina>Right, secondary.</v>

311
00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:02.329
<v ->They are primary,</v>

312
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:04.441
and I've asked people over the years,

313
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:07.876
"Can anyone name one single disease

314
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:11.374
"that's not infectious that they've cured

315
00:11:11.374 --> 00:11:13.571
"in 100 years?"

316
00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:15.577
<v Regina>Such as inflammation based diseases</v>

317
00:11:15.577 --> 00:11:17.006
like arthritis.

318
00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:18.307
<v ->No cure for that.</v>

319
00:11:18.307 --> 00:11:19.609
No cure for heart disease.

320
00:11:19.609 --> 00:11:20.974
No cure for lung disease.

321
00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:22.275
No cure for colitis.

322
00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:24.558
You take these medicines for the rest of your life.

323
00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:27.075
You got it, maybe your genes got it,

324
00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:29.763
maybe this happened, nature doesn't work that way.

325
00:11:29.763 --> 00:11:32.686
Nature works very intelligently.

326
00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:34.712
There are no accidents in nature.

327
00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:37.400
<v Regina>So let's go back to this.</v>

328
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.339
So you have the committee on quackery.

329
00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:41.091
So they start going after people like you.

330
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:44.128
And then they have ingenious methods

331
00:11:44.128 --> 00:11:46.517
that were put in place to start creating

332
00:11:46.517 --> 00:11:48.331
a case against you.

333
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:50.805
The least of which is also seeing to it

334
00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:52.939
that the insurance companies only cover,

335
00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:55.883
again their favorite few so a patient

336
00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:58.699
has no help, or assistance at all

337
00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:00.021
outside of drugs or surgery.

338
00:12:00.021 --> 00:12:03.051
Now that's one way, I know a lot of people

339
00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:04.949
who would love to try other means of

340
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:07.573
more effective means of healing,

341
00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:09.322
but they don't have the money for it,

342
00:12:09.322 --> 00:12:11.264
and their insurance doesn't cover anything.

343
00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:13.098
And they get sicker and sicker in the system.

344
00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:14.272
So what did they do,

345
00:12:14.272 --> 00:12:15.424
what did they do with you?

346
00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:17.152
Let's do a little bit of a diagram of

347
00:12:17.152 --> 00:12:20.672
the ways in which they came after you effectively

348
00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:22.826
and shut you down ultimately.

349
00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:24.682
<v ->Well, number one I was a loudmouth.</v>

350
00:12:24.682 --> 00:12:27.306
That put me in the front pages.

351
00:12:27.306 --> 00:12:29.887
Healthcare estates rights.

352
00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:33.407
I wrote a law in Arizona allowing MDs and osteopaths

353
00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:35.071
that once they're licensed

354
00:12:35.071 --> 00:12:36.714
they can go under their own law,

355
00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.783
the homeopathic medical law.

356
00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:40.658
That was completely different like

357
00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:42.983
a chiropractic law.

358
00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:44.903
The governor, Governor Babbitt, appointed me

359
00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:46.999
to run the law and set the standards.

360
00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.706
Well I became very outspoken

361
00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:50.818
because we had now homeopathy

362
00:12:50.818 --> 00:12:54.338
the philosophy was equal to medicine MD work

363
00:12:54.338 --> 00:12:56.066
in Arizona.

364
00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:58.754
Well I got on TV shows, I got on radio shows

365
00:12:58.754 --> 00:13:01.271
and the next thing I knew all of a sudden

366
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:03.063
I had patients calling me that

367
00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:05.154
Medicare was calling them

368
00:13:05.154 --> 00:13:07.287
and they wanted to know about me

369
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.716
and stuff like that.

370
00:13:08.716 --> 00:13:10.508
They then came in and started

371
00:13:10.508 --> 00:13:12.279
to take files out of my office and

372
00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:14.732
they even took two year old kid files out.

373
00:13:14.732 --> 00:13:16.183
<v Regina>Two year old children?</v>

374
00:13:16.183 --> 00:13:17.015
<v ->Yeah.</v>

375
00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:18.145
I said, "You have no right to do that."

376
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:19.468
It made no difference,

377
00:13:19.468 --> 00:13:21.068
they just smiled at me in their trench coats

378
00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:22.561
carrying my boxes out.

379
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:23.991
<v Regina>And so they were doing this</v>

380
00:13:23.991 --> 00:13:25.335
because they were trying to catch you

381
00:13:25.335 --> 00:13:28.257
on any kind of irregularity including illegible handwriting.

382
00:13:28.257 --> 00:13:29.367
<v ->Anything.</v>

383
00:13:29.367 --> 00:13:30.817
<v Regina>Or if a patient complained,</v>

384
00:13:30.817 --> 00:13:32.737
they said, "Oh, he charged me too much for an office visit."

385
00:13:32.737 --> 00:13:35.574
<v ->Well, they ended up indicting me</v>

386
00:13:35.574 --> 00:13:37.878
on 117 counts of Medicare fraud.

387
00:13:37.878 --> 00:13:40.950
Totaling 3,500 dollars.

388
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.126
After three years.

389
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.556
Now my business at that time.

390
00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:46.198
I had eight practitioners, 20 staff,

391
00:13:46.198 --> 00:13:48.289
my business did over a couple million

392
00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:50.892
dollars gross with all the practitioners.

393
00:13:50.892 --> 00:13:51.980
<v Regina>So that was a lot of activity.</v>

394
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.627
<v ->Right, and they found 3,500 dollars</v>

395
00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.142
of Medicare fraud they said.

396
00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:59.169
At the same time Senator Bill Frist

397
00:13:59.169 --> 00:14:01.921
opened a chain of HMOs around the country.

398
00:14:01.921 --> 00:14:06.123
And he got a Medicare misdemeanor for 1.7 billion

399
00:14:06.123 --> 00:14:08.897
<v Regina>And yours was not a misdemeanor.</v>

400
00:14:08.897 --> 00:14:11.243
<v ->No mine was a fraud.</v>

401
00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Regina>Is that felony?</v>

402
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.006
<v ->Felony. A felony for 3,500.</v>

403
00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:17.416
He got a misdemeanor for 1.7 billion

404
00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:19.827
and wrote a check to cover it.

405
00:14:19.827 --> 00:14:22.174
<v Regina>And went on to a life in politics.</v>

406
00:14:22.174 --> 00:14:24.478
<v ->Right, and I was basically,</v>

407
00:14:24.478 --> 00:14:26.462
we had to negotiate

408
00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:28.339
because they would have thrown me in jail.

409
00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:30.131
I got four years probation

410
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:32.094
and I did, the whole story was,

411
00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:33.822
give up all your licenses and

412
00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:35.528
get out of the United States.

413
00:14:35.528 --> 00:14:36.872
That's what I was told.

414
00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:39.261
<v Regina>And what were the nature</v>

415
00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:41.075
of some of these allegations that,

416
00:14:41.075 --> 00:14:43.443
and also these kind of random audits.

417
00:14:43.443 --> 00:14:44.829
That are not random at all.

418
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:45.960
That aren't even remotely random

419
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.005
they witch hunt.

420
00:14:47.005 --> 00:14:48.115
<v ->Right.</v>

421
00:14:48.115 --> 00:14:50.461
<v Regina>So give us a few examples,</v>

422
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:52.467
besides the illegible handwriting,

423
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:56.925
client complaining an office visit was 100 some dollars.

424
00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:59.954
What were some other things that happened?

425
00:14:59.954 --> 00:15:01.298
<v ->Well, first of all, the biggest thing is</v>

426
00:15:01.298 --> 00:15:04.029
the first audit that I had is where they picked out

427
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:08.040
those cases, those 28 cases of my 5,000 files.

428
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.408
They picked out the only 28 chelation

429
00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:12.328
cases in my entire files.

430
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.269
<v Regina>So they went after chelation specificially?</v>

431
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:17.085
<v ->That means it wasn't a random search.</v>

432
00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:18.024
<v Regina>No.</v>

433
00:15:18.024 --> 00:15:19.560
<v ->They looked at the codes,</v>

434
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.266
which is a fourth amendment illegal

435
00:15:21.266 --> 00:15:23.485
violation of spying.

436
00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:25.682
So they started to audit chelation people

437
00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:27.431
around the country.

438
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:29.330
22 other chelation people ordered

439
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.314
the same brand of audit that I was.

440
00:15:31.314 --> 00:15:32.722
<v Regina>In fact, I just heard</v>

441
00:15:32.722 --> 00:15:35.218
another report going after the same subject

442
00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:37.778
on NPR yesterday, there's another round

443
00:15:37.778 --> 00:15:40.317
of trying to shut down chelation practices.

444
00:15:40.317 --> 00:15:41.874
And so this continues.

445
00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.260
But this was in what year?

446
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.095
When did this all start happening with you?

447
00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:48.935
<v ->Oh mine, 1985 is when I first get my audit.</v>

448
00:15:48.935 --> 00:15:50.684
<v Regina>Now, you didn't think there was</v>

449
00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:52.242
a conspiracy of any kind at this time?

450
00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.908
<v ->I was naive, I was naive.</v>

451
00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:56.018
And I should have stopped

452
00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:57.255
and said wait a second.

453
00:15:57.255 --> 00:16:00.604
I should have immediately said, no I don't want that audit.

454
00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:01.842
I should have hired a lawyer.

455
00:16:01.842 --> 00:16:04.295
And said prove this is a random audit.

456
00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:06.172
It was physically impossible.

457
00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:07.985
But I was naive.

458
00:16:07.985 --> 00:16:10.268
If the same thing happened to me again,

459
00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:12.423
I would have done it a different way.

460
00:16:12.423 --> 00:16:14.769
<v Regina>Now, as time went on,</v>

461
00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:17.713
you were used as an example and held up high.

462
00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:20.017
In the media even, Dateline, which

463
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:25.564
really skewered any kind of complimentary

464
00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:28.112
and alternative medical practices with you

465
00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:29.200
as their poster child.

466
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.876
<v ->Yes.</v>

467
00:16:29.876 --> 00:16:30.986
<v Regina>You were smeared all over</v>

468
00:16:30.986 --> 00:16:32.202
in the national media.

469
00:16:32.202 --> 00:16:33.204
<v ->Yes.</v>

470
00:16:33.204 --> 00:16:34.314
<v Regina>What happened with that?</v>

471
00:16:34.314 --> 00:16:36.212
<v ->Well what's interesting what went on with that</v>

472
00:16:36.212 --> 00:16:38.239
is Dateline filmed me for about three hours

473
00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:39.476
and if you watch the whole show

474
00:16:39.476 --> 00:16:41.226
that they did I think it was '93,

475
00:16:41.226 --> 00:16:43.743
you see me for about five minutes.

476
00:16:43.743 --> 00:16:46.772
And you never see in almost all

477
00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.607
of these interview shows, you'll see

478
00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.100
the back of the head of one

479
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.849
and the face of the other.

480
00:16:51.849 --> 00:16:53.535
So they're just splicing it in.

481
00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Regina>Oh of course, I know that well</v>

482
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.308
from my days in news.

483
00:16:56.308 --> 00:16:58.420
<v ->Right, they're just splicing it in.</v>

484
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.063
If I were to know what they were doing,

485
00:17:00.063 --> 00:17:01.300
after about two and half hours,

486
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.815
they started to get nasty

487
00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:04.415
and I finally threw them out.

488
00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:08.169
But they just cherry picked the whole thing

489
00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:10.388
And it was sponsored by the industry.

490
00:17:10.388 --> 00:17:13.289
<v Regina>Using the media is one way</v>

491
00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:16.398
to keep this kind of brainwashing moving.

492
00:17:16.617 --> 00:17:18.452
<v ->Listen every night to the news story.</v>

493
00:17:18.452 --> 00:17:21.012
<v Regina>So you were publicly humiliated at this time.</v>

494
00:17:21.012 --> 00:17:24.702
<v ->Yes. I was publicly humiliated at that time.</v>

495
00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:29.706
I got basically, it ends up throwing me out

496
00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.706
of the United States,

497
00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:33.653
out of Arizona.

498
00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:34.997
<v Regina>Did Medicare,</v>

499
00:17:34.997 --> 00:17:36.213
was there another step in there

500
00:17:36.213 --> 00:17:37.407
where you...

501
00:17:37.407 --> 00:17:39.221
<v ->Well Medicare brought up the charges against me.</v>

502
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:43.637
I had the lowest indictment in Medicare history,

503
00:17:43.637 --> 00:17:46.645
and the lowest conviction in Medicare history.

504
00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:49.567
<v Regina>And yet you were stripped of everything.</v>

505
00:17:49.567 --> 00:17:52.191
<v ->Yes, I was basically, that's it.</v>

506
00:17:52.191 --> 00:17:55.215
It's a choice of jail or get out of the country.

507
00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:57.226
<v Regina>So by this time your nerves were shot</v>

508
00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:59.018
you could see, and I want to get to this

509
00:17:59.018 --> 00:18:00.703
other part in a bit where there's this

510
00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:02.623
collusion between the agencies.

511
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.543
The American Pharmaceutical Association,

512
00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:07.444
the FDA, the AMA, even the US Postal Service,

513
00:18:07.444 --> 00:18:09.279
and help us tie those pieces together,

514
00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.924
so we can understand how deep the process is.

515
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:15.530
But for you, your nerves were shattered by this time.

516
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.964
You just kept having one audit after the other.

517
00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:21.353
Your body had almost given up the ghost,

518
00:18:21.353 --> 00:18:23.871
you had three kids and a wife.

519
00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:27.369
<v ->And I had so much intestinal stress out of it</v>

520
00:18:27.369 --> 00:18:29.567
I blew a hole in a diverticulum,

521
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.956
ended up with five surgeries and almost died.

522
00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.111
And finally I had four years probation.

523
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:35.391
So interesting.

524
00:18:35.391 --> 00:18:37.311
My new lawyer went into the court

525
00:18:37.311 --> 00:18:38.932
just wanting to get me off probation

526
00:18:38.932 --> 00:18:41.556
and the judge, the prosecutor said

527
00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:43.817
"Well, we have our pound of flesh from him."

528
00:18:43.817 --> 00:18:45.865
<v Regina>Yes, literally.</v>

529
00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:46.996
They got it.

530
00:18:46.996 --> 00:18:48.830
They got what they wanted from you

531
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.982
<v ->They got what they wanted.</v>

532
00:18:49.982 --> 00:18:51.518
<v Regina>They made an example of you, but</v>

533
00:18:51.518 --> 00:18:53.118
you see the thing is you were high profile,

534
00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:54.974
you had a thriving practice,

535
00:18:54.974 --> 00:18:56.468
you wrote the law in Arizona,

536
00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:00.670
you were helping a tremendous number of people,

537
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.593
without complaint, in fact with praise.

538
00:19:03.593 --> 00:19:04.915
<v ->I never had an official complaint.</v>

539
00:19:04.915 --> 00:19:07.006
<v Regina>So they needed to take you down.</v>

540
00:19:07.006 --> 00:19:09.246
You were one of them they had to take down.

541
00:19:09.246 --> 00:19:12.659
But you're not the only one.

542
00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:15.475
There are quiet ones that are in the wings

543
00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:17.310
that are trying to to do their practices

544
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.038
similar things have happened to.

545
00:19:19.038 --> 00:19:21.278
<v ->Every alternative physician in the United States today</v>

546
00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:23.710
is like a Jewish person in Nazi Germany.

547
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.950
They're afraid that they're going

548
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.360
to be taken down for something ridiculous.

549
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.368
The control on it is so frightening.

550
00:19:31.368 --> 00:19:33.822
everyone, they're all scared out there.

551
00:19:33.822 --> 00:19:38.302
And there's got to be like 70,000 or something like that

552
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.392
that are into some type of alternative medicine

553
00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:43.016
and they're all panicked.

554
00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:47.112
<v Regina>You know, you had chosen to walk away</v>

555
00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:49.565
from the field of allopathic medicine a long time ago,

556
00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:51.699
1976 as I recall in your book,

557
00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:54.835
you walked away from it because you knew

558
00:19:54.835 --> 00:19:56.243
that you were not helping people,

559
00:19:56.243 --> 00:19:57.224
<v ->Correct.</v>

560
00:19:57.224 --> 00:19:58.397
<v Regina>And you had already been turned onto</v>

561
00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:00.723
various modalities that were helping people by this time.

562
00:20:00.723 --> 00:20:04.200
You took an 80% pay decrease

563
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.245
<v ->Yes.</v>

564
00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:06.942
<v Regina>In order to have the privilege</v>

565
00:20:06.942 --> 00:20:09.575
of actually helping people find literal cures.

566
00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.389
<v ->That's what I wanted to do in life.</v>

567
00:20:11.389 --> 00:20:12.647
It wasn't making money.

568
00:20:12.647 --> 00:20:15.868
It's fixing people, that's what the goal is.

569
00:20:15.868 --> 00:20:19.132
And it was so depressing that no one gets better.

570
00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:21.799
The average doctor lives 40 years less

571
00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:23.868
than the average person because deep down

572
00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:26.258
inside they know they're all wrong.

573
00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.943
<v Regina>They know they're not seeing</v>

574
00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:29.010
their clients get better.

575
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.247
<v ->They're not seeing anybody get any better.</v>

576
00:20:30.247 --> 00:20:31.250
It really is so upsetting.

577
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.556
Patient comes in, "I'm not better, I'm worse."

578
00:20:34.556 --> 00:20:35.687
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

579
00:20:35.687 --> 00:20:36.348
<v ->No,</v>

580
00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:38.503
I couldn't practice that way.

581
00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.060
I had to find a way to get them better.

582
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.980
<v Regina>So you went to the trouble</v>

583
00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.201
of the education, continuing education,

584
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:47.271
and doing this practice,

585
00:20:47.271 --> 00:20:49.788
and now we see where it landed you

586
00:20:49.788 --> 00:20:51.175
which is basically without any licenses.

587
00:20:51.175 --> 00:20:52.519
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

588
00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:54.247
<v Regina>And for a while, you went over to Tijuana</v>

589
00:20:54.247 --> 00:20:56.124
to just to try to keep some of your clients going

590
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.044
just because you had to get over the border,

591
00:20:58.044 --> 00:20:59.473
so you could even continue helping.

592
00:20:59.473 --> 00:21:00.689
<v ->Try to make a living,</v>

593
00:21:00.689 --> 00:21:02.780
and live and continue what I'm doing.

594
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.340
Because the US said, I had someone in the US said,

595
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.684
"Why don't you go to another profession?"

596
00:21:06.684 --> 00:21:08.262
Wait a second.

597
00:21:08.262 --> 00:21:10.310
I spent 40 years of my life going this way,

598
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.105
I should now go own a store, what are you crazy?

599
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.236
<v Regina>And you're passionate about it.</v>

600
00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:17.713
I know you, and you have total passion

601
00:21:17.713 --> 00:21:19.611
about every time you have a success story

602
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.446
you're so thrilled everyday

603
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.323
when someone walks out feeling better.

604
00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:25.798
So you're a genuine healer by nature.

605
00:21:25.798 --> 00:21:28.187
<v ->It's so exciting.</v>

606
00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:30.321
I get so much joy out of watching

607
00:21:30.321 --> 00:21:32.283
a person improve and get better.

608
00:21:32.283 --> 00:21:33.350
<v Regina>So meanwhile,</v>

609
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.737
while you're getting on and trying

610
00:21:34.737 --> 00:21:35.697
to do your thing.

611
00:21:35.697 --> 00:21:39.121
There's a proliferation of these various agencies,

612
00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:41.751
and so forth, and these various, I guess they would be,

613
00:21:41.751 --> 00:21:42.924
task forces.

614
00:21:42.924 --> 00:21:45.356
What about the National Council Against Health Fraud?

615
00:21:45.356 --> 00:21:47.511
All of these different groups set up

616
00:21:47.511 --> 00:21:50.156
to basically pick off one at a time

617
00:21:50.156 --> 00:21:52.097
everyone that's not towing the mark.

618
00:21:52.097 --> 00:21:53.505
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

619
00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:57.303
All of this, again, it's a propaganda conspiracy,

620
00:21:57.303 --> 00:21:59.884
look at the statistics we're so bad

621
00:21:59.884 --> 00:22:02.209
in the United States, it's all drugs and poison,

622
00:22:02.209 --> 00:22:04.812
but they make so much money

623
00:22:04.812 --> 00:22:08.225
that's why the news, they talk about it all the time.

624
00:22:08.225 --> 00:22:09.526
<v Regina>It's on all the time.</v>

625
00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:11.233
<v ->All the time, every time.</v>

626
00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:13.025
<v Regina>Every news show has</v>

627
00:22:13.025 --> 00:22:15.542
their own doctor now to give advice.

628
00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.185
<v ->Right and with new exciting things</v>

629
00:22:17.185 --> 00:22:20.300
that always just around the horizon.

630
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.262
The only time the word cure is ever used

631
00:22:22.262 --> 00:22:23.942
in medicine today is at the end

632
00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:24.950
of a sentence.

633
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.060
We are searching for a,

634
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.129
we are close to a,

635
00:22:28.129 --> 00:22:31.243
and medical doctor cannot offer you a cure.

636
00:22:31.243 --> 00:22:33.185
Because since they've never cured anything

637
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.870
if they offer you a cure,

638
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.427
they can lose their license,

639
00:22:36.427 --> 00:22:37.622
it's a false hope.

640
00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:38.881
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

641
00:22:38.881 --> 00:22:40.161
<v ->I was told straightforward,</v>

642
00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:41.611
you can't cure people,

643
00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:43.723
you're not allowed to in the United States.

644
00:22:43.723 --> 00:22:44.982
<v Regina>When you were going through</v>

645
00:22:44.982 --> 00:22:46.433
this whole journey of your own

646
00:22:46.433 --> 00:22:47.819
it wasn't,

647
00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:50.955
there had to be the,

648
00:22:50.955 --> 00:22:53.152
they had to have accomplices,

649
00:22:53.152 --> 00:22:55.136
in trying to remove you.

650
00:22:55.136 --> 00:22:56.331
And they came to your own staff

651
00:22:56.331 --> 00:22:57.782
and your own people.

652
00:22:57.782 --> 00:22:59.126
And they threatened them,

653
00:22:59.126 --> 00:23:02.880
if they didn't comply and testify against

654
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.568
you or give some type of testimony.

655
00:23:05.568 --> 00:23:07.510
<v ->They called up my patients</v>

656
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.238
and said if they didn't testify against me

657
00:23:09.238 --> 00:23:11.840
they'd take away their Social Security and Medicare.

658
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.739
Now that's, they just frighten them,

659
00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:15.253
that's illegal.

660
00:23:15.253 --> 00:23:18.069
I had at least half a dozen patients call me

661
00:23:18.069 --> 00:23:19.669
and tell me that story.

662
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:21.547
That someone from a federal agency called up

663
00:23:21.547 --> 00:23:23.061
and threatened to take away their

664
00:23:23.061 --> 00:23:24.896
Social Security and Medicare if they

665
00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:27.243
did not testify against me.

666
00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:28.885
Think of that.

667
00:23:28.885 --> 00:23:31.125
The US Government threatened them

668
00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:32.768
with something that's impossible.

669
00:23:32.768 --> 00:23:34.432
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

670
00:23:34.432 --> 00:23:35.797
<v ->So it's very frightening,</v>

671
00:23:35.797 --> 00:23:38.400
To me, we don't realize how much

672
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.725
an Orwellian conspiracy this country's in.

673
00:23:40.725 --> 00:23:42.730
We think we're a free country,

674
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.309
no we're not.

675
00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:45.397
Like I said before,

676
00:23:45.397 --> 00:23:46.506
they'll pay me a quarter of a million dollars

677
00:23:46.506 --> 00:23:47.786
to cut your heart out of your chest

678
00:23:47.786 --> 00:23:49.088
but they will not pay me money

679
00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:50.538
to fix it in your chest.

680
00:23:50.538 --> 00:23:53.525
<v Regina>They won't pay you 200 to fix it.</v>

681
00:23:53.525 --> 00:23:56.127
<v ->Right, and if I fix it,</v>

682
00:23:56.127 --> 00:23:57.599
they'll probably come after me

683
00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:59.157
and arrest me.

684
00:23:59.157 --> 00:24:00.330
Because when I fix things,

685
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.101
no one's fixed anything,

686
00:24:02.101 --> 00:24:04.533
therefore you have to be a quack.

687
00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:06.602
<v Regina>And it sounds like</v>

688
00:24:06.602 --> 00:24:08.095
the conspiracy may be

689
00:24:08.095 --> 00:24:09.397
deepening a little bit.

690
00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:10.591
Because now we have,

691
00:24:10.591 --> 00:24:12.643
and I don't know if that's a

692
00:24:12.643 --> 00:24:15.055
figurative or literal term in saying that,

693
00:24:15.055 --> 00:24:16.500
if I'm even correct.

694
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.912
But we seem to have some

695
00:24:17.912 --> 00:24:19.381
complications with Obamacare.

696
00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:22.438
<v ->Oh that's, he's been so brainwashed,</v>

697
00:24:22.438 --> 00:24:24.166
the system is so brainwashed,

698
00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:26.192
Obamacare is going to pay for the MDs,

699
00:24:26.192 --> 00:24:27.963
but they're not going to pay

700
00:24:27.963 --> 00:24:30.374
for the acupuncturists and the naturopaths

701
00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:31.675
and that stuff.

702
00:24:31.675 --> 00:24:32.891
So there's no choice.

703
00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:35.152
You're given a monopoly.

704
00:24:35.152 --> 00:24:38.310
That's a monopoly you're giving to one system.

705
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.272
Look it up.

706
00:24:40.272 --> 00:24:41.848
I actually had a lawyer years ago,

707
00:24:41.848 --> 00:24:43.068
a very famous lawyer,

708
00:24:43.098 --> 00:24:44.165
who died in the middle of the case,

709
00:24:44.165 --> 00:24:45.210
it was a shame.

710
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.664
<v Regina>Oh yeah, he worked with F Lee Bailey,</v>

711
00:24:47.664 --> 00:24:48.837
and high profile.

712
00:24:48.837 --> 00:24:52.122
<v ->Yes, very high profile lawyer,</v>

713
00:24:52.122 --> 00:24:54.639
and we actually sued the federal government

714
00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:55.919
for anti-trust.

715
00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:57.818
And the judge did not throw it out.

716
00:24:57.818 --> 00:24:59.183
They wanted to amend the suit

717
00:24:59.183 --> 00:25:01.637
and Henry died during the suit

718
00:25:01.637 --> 00:25:03.322
but we really had that

719
00:25:03.322 --> 00:25:05.434
because what's going on today

720
00:25:05.434 --> 00:25:06.309
in this country is,

721
00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:08.207
it's a brainwash and it's horrible.

722
00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:09.743
Look at statistics.

723
00:25:09.743 --> 00:25:10.789
Can you imagine?

724
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:13.839
We're 37th in the world in longevity in healthcare

725
00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:16.228
and we spend twice as much as the French

726
00:25:16.228 --> 00:25:19.002
and look at us, look how fat we are.

727
00:25:19.002 --> 00:25:21.242
Look at what we are,

728
00:25:21.242 --> 00:25:22.799
look what the French eat.

729
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:25.103
3-5,000 calories a day, they're not fat.

730
00:25:25.103 --> 00:25:27.236
You don't see fat frenchmen

731
00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:28.708
but you see it in the United States.

732
00:25:28.708 --> 00:25:30.948
And it's from those chemicals and poisons.

733
00:25:30.948 --> 00:25:31.908
Everything you have,

734
00:25:31.908 --> 00:25:34.042
anything with--

735
00:25:34.042 --> 00:25:34.916
<v Regina>And they're trying to introduce</v>

736
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.239
all of that into France now.

737
00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:37.625
They're trying.

738
00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:38.884
<v ->Yeah, it's the western world.</v>

739
00:25:38.884 --> 00:25:40.761
It's more of the western world.

740
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:42.745
When you look at the 37 countries

741
00:25:42.745 --> 00:25:43.663
ahead of us, you're going to

742
00:25:43.663 --> 00:25:45.177
find Oman, Morocco,

743
00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:46.585
you're going to find third world countries

744
00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:48.015
that live longer than us.

745
00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:50.745
Because they're not getting poison

746
00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:52.495
and their foods are fresh.

747
00:25:52.495 --> 00:25:53.668
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

748
00:25:53.668 --> 00:25:55.289
<v ->To me, I like what Deepak Chopra says,</v>

749
00:25:55.289 --> 00:25:57.017
"Anything that's in a can or has a label on it

750
00:25:57.017 --> 00:25:58.276
"is not human."

751
00:25:58.276 --> 00:26:00.686
<v Regina>Yeah, not fit for human consumption.</v>

752
00:26:00.686 --> 00:26:02.244
<v ->Not fit for human consumption.</v>

753
00:26:02.244 --> 00:26:05.444
<v Regina>So, we and people can go ahead</v>

754
00:26:05.444 --> 00:26:07.001
and download this book,

755
00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:10.308
it's on your website, "Medical Conspiracy in America"

756
00:26:10.308 --> 00:26:11.844
and then go through

757
00:26:11.844 --> 00:26:14.894
step by step how the system takes people down.

758
00:26:14.894 --> 00:26:16.537
Because we just kind of touched

759
00:26:16.537 --> 00:26:18.371
on a little bit of it because I want to get

760
00:26:18.371 --> 00:26:20.419
on a little bit more on Obamacare.

761
00:26:20.419 --> 00:26:23.961
And what is that going,

762
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:25.731
what does that offer us,

763
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:26.777
where does that limit us,

764
00:26:26.777 --> 00:26:28.270
besides what you said just a moment ago

765
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.062
that it won't pay out for any

766
00:26:30.062 --> 00:26:32.067
of the other types of modalities.

767
00:26:32.067 --> 00:26:34.030
<v ->It gives the, it's going to give</v>

768
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.801
the medical professionals a monopoly.

769
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:37.614
<v Regina>But don't they have that already?</v>

770
00:26:37.614 --> 00:26:38.873
Is it really any different from

771
00:26:38.873 --> 00:26:39.896
where we are right now?

772
00:26:39.896 --> 00:26:41.432
<v ->It's going to make it more so.</v>

773
00:26:41.432 --> 00:26:43.502
So the Medicare one especially,

774
00:26:43.502 --> 00:26:46.254
we're having the baby boomers hitting that.

775
00:26:46.254 --> 00:26:48.984
Well, every baby boomer they imagined,

776
00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:51.182
to me what doctors are today,

777
00:26:51.182 --> 00:26:52.696
is they have a knife in one hand

778
00:26:52.696 --> 00:26:54.040
and drool coming out of their mouth

779
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.494
as soon as the patient comes in.

780
00:26:56.494 --> 00:26:57.710
And the moment a Medicare patient comes in.

781
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.203
<v Regina>That's quite a vision.</v>

782
00:26:59.203 --> 00:27:02.531
<v ->Okay, they can't wait to find something to cut.</v>

783
00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:03.917
"Oh you need this cut.

784
00:27:03.917 --> 00:27:04.963
"We don't know about that

785
00:27:04.963 --> 00:27:05.816
"We need that cut"

786
00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:07.288
so they can make money.

787
00:27:07.288 --> 00:27:09.571
And Obamacare is leading to that

788
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:11.213
and zero.

789
00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:12.536
<v Regina>So we really won't,</v>

790
00:27:12.536 --> 00:27:14.605
what will we do effectively,

791
00:27:14.605 --> 00:27:17.400
I mean right now people are paying out of pocket

792
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.280
for acupuncture and most of these modalities anyway.

793
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:25.165
So will it have any real effect on those of us

794
00:27:25.165 --> 00:27:27.823
who are already willing to take responsibility for

795
00:27:27.823 --> 00:27:30.532
and pay out of pocket for our healthcare?

796
00:27:30.532 --> 00:27:32.175
<v ->The biggest responsibility,</v>

797
00:27:32.175 --> 00:27:33.775
the biggest effect it'll have on you is

798
00:27:33.775 --> 00:27:34.991
it's going to cost you money.

799
00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:36.079
The other way, see,

800
00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:37.977
you can get medical doctors for free.

801
00:27:37.977 --> 00:27:40.089
But if you want to go to the acupuncturist,

802
00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:41.647
it's going to cost you money.

803
00:27:41.647 --> 00:27:43.588
And that's the name of the game over there.

804
00:27:43.588 --> 00:27:45.209
Here for free,

805
00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:46.767
and it's--

806
00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:50.265
<v Regina>It's totally loaded in that direction.</v>

807
00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:53.700
Is there a larger conspiracy that you see

808
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.193
in all of this?

809
00:27:55.193 --> 00:27:58.521
When you look at, besides the profit motive

810
00:27:58.521 --> 00:28:01.529
which is huge, we know that's kind of,

811
00:28:01.529 --> 00:28:03.557
follow the money, pretty much you can take,

812
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:05.988
everything that happens on a,

813
00:28:05.988 --> 00:28:08.206
whether it's a state, federal, whatever level,

814
00:28:08.206 --> 00:28:10.356
public sector level,

815
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:12.211
we can take that back to money.

816
00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:14.030
But is there anything beyond that,

817
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.851
about the degeneration of the health

818
00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:18.625
of a nation and nations in the west.

819
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.032
<v ->Many have questions on that.</v>

820
00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.419
I think the United States is probably

821
00:28:21.419 --> 00:28:22.848
the most chemicalized nation.

822
00:28:22.848 --> 00:28:25.110
Is that intentional or not?

823
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.584
I think it's partly intentional.

824
00:28:27.584 --> 00:28:29.547
Partly some of the stuff that is

825
00:28:29.547 --> 00:28:31.595
put in the medication makes you a robot,

826
00:28:31.595 --> 00:28:34.134
makes you puppet so you're going to listen.

827
00:28:34.134 --> 00:28:38.059
I think those medications have dumbed-down our country.

828
00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:41.771
We're not the top country in the world anymore.

829
00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:43.413
Education.

830
00:28:43.413 --> 00:28:44.928
We're probably about,

831
00:28:44.928 --> 00:28:47.467
we don't rank high in education.

832
00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:49.515
Okay in this country.

833
00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:52.032
And it all I think is a lot of dumbing-down

834
00:28:52.032 --> 00:28:54.571
of the system of the,

835
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:57.621
it's a fascist system,

836
00:28:57.621 --> 00:29:00.267
it's the big business controls it,

837
00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:01.420
and it's the dumbing down of the control

838
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.485
of that thing.

839
00:29:02.485 --> 00:29:03.680
Oh you see it on TV,

840
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.045
"Go to your doctor for this,

841
00:29:05.045 --> 00:29:06.496
"go to your doctor for that"

842
00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:08.224
That's just programming.

843
00:29:08.224 --> 00:29:09.398
That's just programming in

844
00:29:09.398 --> 00:29:11.061
an Orwellian propaganda.

845
00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:12.618
What is it?

846
00:29:12.618 --> 00:29:14.965
It's control, control, control, control.

847
00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:16.970
They also control the politics,

848
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.680
because it's the lobbyists that

849
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.962
pay for the campaigns.

850
00:29:21.962 --> 00:29:23.797
So the bigger the business,

851
00:29:23.797 --> 00:29:26.527
the more money they're giving it,

852
00:29:26.527 --> 00:29:28.319
and they're controlling it.

853
00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:29.471
And that's what's going on

854
00:29:29.471 --> 00:29:31.349
with Obama, he ran free to a certain degree,

855
00:29:31.349 --> 00:29:33.183
but now in there he's changing,

856
00:29:33.183 --> 00:29:34.997
he's dancing around because

857
00:29:34.997 --> 00:29:36.853
if he wants to get elected again

858
00:29:36.853 --> 00:29:38.474
and the Republicans got elected this time

859
00:29:38.474 --> 00:29:39.926
and beat him a lot,

860
00:29:39.926 --> 00:29:41.738
he's got to listen to the lobbyists.

861
00:29:41.738 --> 00:29:42.719
<v Regina>Oh, they all do.</v>

862
00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:43.509
Doesn't matter,

863
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:44.596
just put a new face in.

864
00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:45.962
They'll march to the tune.

865
00:29:45.962 --> 00:29:48.010
<v ->Right, and I think he was just naive on it.</v>

866
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.503
Now he's caught.

867
00:29:49.503 --> 00:29:51.786
President's a short termer,

868
00:29:51.786 --> 00:29:53.984
they only got eight years but.

869
00:29:53.984 --> 00:29:57.140
<v Regina>And these agendas take</v>

870
00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.124
decades to implement sometimes.

871
00:29:59.124 --> 00:30:00.148
<v ->Yes.</v>

872
00:30:00.148 --> 00:30:01.535
<v Regina>And there's a much larger</v>

873
00:30:01.535 --> 00:30:03.519
amount at stake for those who are

874
00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:06.484
creating these agendas and carrying

875
00:30:06.484 --> 00:30:07.871
them forth.

876
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:09.556
President like you say,

877
00:30:09.556 --> 00:30:11.035
he's a puppet for four years.

878
00:30:11.035 --> 00:30:11.975
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

879
00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:13.183
It's the system that's in control,

880
00:30:13.183 --> 00:30:15.336
we think the President controls them.

881
00:30:15.336 --> 00:30:16.872
We should.

882
00:30:16.872 --> 00:30:20.009
Obama does not use the bully pulpit the way he should.

883
00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:23.336
He loves consensus and he does

884
00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:27.219
what the industry, the lobbyists are

885
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:29.608
really directing him towards.

886
00:30:29.608 --> 00:30:30.888
And it's sad watching him.

887
00:30:30.888 --> 00:30:33.256
<v Regina>So for you Obamacare big thumbs down.</v>

888
00:30:33.256 --> 00:30:35.304
<v ->Oh, it's going to be a horror show,</v>

889
00:30:35.304 --> 00:30:36.883
it's going to cost us a fortune

890
00:30:36.883 --> 00:30:38.419
and it's a failure.

891
00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:40.359
You're going to give it all to the MDs

892
00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:42.322
who haven't cured anything in 100 years?

893
00:30:42.322 --> 00:30:45.223
I mean why give it to a failure?

894
00:30:45.223 --> 00:30:47.421
Because the failure has people

895
00:30:47.421 --> 00:30:49.405
that are paying you off to do that.

896
00:30:49.405 --> 00:30:52.327
<v Regina>Yeah, meanwhile</v>

897
00:30:52.327 --> 00:30:55.399
let's go back to you and others like you

898
00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:58.172
that have been through this kind of dance.

899
00:30:58.172 --> 00:31:00.114
Although yours was particularly severe

900
00:31:00.114 --> 00:31:02.140
as documented in your book.

901
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.484
But you're still here,

902
00:31:03.484 --> 00:31:05.127
you still have an office,

903
00:31:05.127 --> 00:31:08.492
let's talk about how your life works now,

904
00:31:09.671 --> 00:31:12.103
in the field of assisting people

905
00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.319
to heal their bodies.

906
00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:14.919
What are your constraints

907
00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:16.284
and so forth?

908
00:31:16.284 --> 00:31:17.969
<v ->Well first of all, we've done it before,</v>

909
00:31:17.969 --> 00:31:19.356
I studied the blood live.

910
00:31:19.356 --> 00:31:21.276
But I'm not allowed to touch a patient

911
00:31:21.276 --> 00:31:22.577
because I don't have a license.

912
00:31:22.577 --> 00:31:23.708
So the patient can actually

913
00:31:23.708 --> 00:31:25.009
stick their own finger.

914
00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:26.887
<v Regina>And you have other people that work</v>

915
00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:28.721
in your office that can do these things.

916
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:29.553
<v ->I do have other people</v>

917
00:31:29.553 --> 00:31:30.300
that do some stuff

918
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.857
that do body manipulation.

919
00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:34.118
But then I look at the blood from there,

920
00:31:34.118 --> 00:31:36.849
I'll start to direct the treatments on that.

921
00:31:36.849 --> 00:31:39.836
I have a very very busy practice,

922
00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:41.692
the treatments I use essentially

923
00:31:41.692 --> 00:31:43.334
are all European.

924
00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:46.790
What I do is I don't just stop the problem,

925
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.774
I regenerate tissue.

926
00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:50.438
Very important.

927
00:31:50.438 --> 00:31:51.590
<v Regina>Let's talk about that.</v>

928
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.318
Let's talk about it from say, let's use

929
00:31:53.318 --> 00:31:55.110
let's use the heart.

930
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.945
Someone who has heart disease.

931
00:31:56.945 --> 00:31:58.225
<v ->Yes.</v>

932
00:31:58.225 --> 00:31:59.953
<v Regina>Let's just isolate on that for a moment</v>

933
00:31:59.953 --> 00:32:01.169
and how this works because

934
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:01.937
some of this has progressed

935
00:32:01.937 --> 00:32:03.025
since we last talked.

936
00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.283
<v ->Yes, definitely</v>

937
00:32:04.283 --> 00:32:05.286
<v Regina>And I want to talk about</v>

938
00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:06.374
some of what you've learned

939
00:32:06.374 --> 00:32:07.313
in the last couple of years

940
00:32:07.313 --> 00:32:08.571
as you continue down this path.

941
00:32:08.571 --> 00:32:10.790
<v ->First of all, the heart's a glamour organ,</v>

942
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.155
it does only one thing,

943
00:32:12.155 --> 00:32:13.371
if it fails, the world knows it.

944
00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:14.587
The liver does 500 things,

945
00:32:14.587 --> 00:32:15.846
if it fails on two or three,

946
00:32:15.846 --> 00:32:16.824
who the hell knows it?

947
00:32:16.824 --> 00:32:19.469
And the heart only does one thing,

948
00:32:19.469 --> 00:32:21.666
it's helped by the diaphragm,

949
00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:23.543
the chest and the lungs all work

950
00:32:23.543 --> 00:32:25.762
like a bellows on the heart, helping it.

951
00:32:25.762 --> 00:32:28.151
If that chest wall is out of align

952
00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:29.858
if that bellow is out of align

953
00:32:29.858 --> 00:32:31.479
that heart may go irregular.

954
00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:33.399
So, the most important thing,

955
00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:34.679
the first thing you look at,

956
00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:36.301
is the structure of the body.

957
00:32:36.301 --> 00:32:38.839
In evolution, function created structure.

958
00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:40.844
Giraffes made their necks higher

959
00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:42.978
because the ice age made the trees higher.

960
00:32:42.978 --> 00:32:45.900
The lore of biological medicine

961
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.906
is structure precedes function.

962
00:32:47.906 --> 00:32:50.316
Open up the structure, expand it,

963
00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:51.212
get them breathing.

964
00:32:51.212 --> 00:32:53.815
The most, biggest damage to structure

965
00:32:53.815 --> 00:32:55.824
that we have found

966
00:32:55.824 --> 00:32:57.446
and I found in the past number of years

967
00:32:57.446 --> 00:32:58.875
since we've talked before.

968
00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.987
Is an injury to the body,

969
00:33:00.987 --> 00:33:02.629
and the biggest injury is a knife wound.

970
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:04.336
And we call that surgery.

971
00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:07.088
Now, what that surgery do,

972
00:33:07.088 --> 00:33:08.667
if I cut your appendix out,

973
00:33:08.667 --> 00:33:10.245
we say an appendix doesn't mean anything,

974
00:33:10.245 --> 00:33:12.443
a dumb creator put this thing in there.

975
00:33:12.443 --> 00:33:14.281
That it only bursts.

976
00:33:14.281 --> 00:33:15.897
So I cut your appendix out.

977
00:33:15.897 --> 00:33:18.372
Now that scar is a traction line

978
00:33:18.372 --> 00:33:20.398
that is pulling on your whole body.

979
00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:22.638
Now there's five diaphragms of the body

980
00:33:22.638 --> 00:33:25.283
the diaphragm is constantly pumping,

981
00:33:25.283 --> 00:33:27.801
the body is constantly expanding and contracting.

982
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:29.486
That scar pulls it and blocks it

983
00:33:29.486 --> 00:33:30.873
and is like a dam.

984
00:33:30.873 --> 00:33:33.582
At the dam garbage accumulates

985
00:33:33.582 --> 00:33:35.054
circulation doesn't get through

986
00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:36.355
the body can't expand

987
00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:38.684
and contract or I call it body respiration.

988
00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:41.116
So you think about it, the worst injury

989
00:33:41.116 --> 00:33:43.825
is surgery and now surgery is doing

990
00:33:43.825 --> 00:33:45.511
so much to the body.

991
00:33:45.511 --> 00:33:47.324
So I go after the surgical wounds,

992
00:33:47.324 --> 00:33:48.711
I treat the scars.

993
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:50.737
Then we manipulate the body,

994
00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:52.700
the scar treatments are called neuro-therapy.

995
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.791
I can start to loosen them up

996
00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:56.796
by my treatments and as I loosen them up

997
00:33:56.796 --> 00:33:59.185
the osteopath as we start to stretch the body

998
00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:01.020
the body can now breathe better.

999
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.663
<v Regina>One question at this point.</v>

1000
00:34:02.663 --> 00:34:05.073
How many people that come to you

1001
00:34:05.073 --> 00:34:08.508
will put the pieces together enough to say

1002
00:34:08.508 --> 00:34:11.110
"You know, I had this surgery and

1003
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.881
"I never been quite right since then."

1004
00:34:12.881 --> 00:34:13.990
Is that common?

1005
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:15.868
<v ->No, they don't realize it till they come to me</v>

1006
00:34:15.868 --> 00:34:17.233
and I tell them that.

1007
00:34:17.233 --> 00:34:19.366
Like it's so common to get people,

1008
00:34:19.366 --> 00:34:21.350
lyme disease now is an epidemic,

1009
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.950
they're blaming it on the germ.

1010
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.572
It's not the germ.

1011
00:34:24.572 --> 00:34:26.427
Typical case comes in,

1012
00:34:26.427 --> 00:34:28.305
lyme disease now for two years,

1013
00:34:28.305 --> 00:34:29.953
he got it two years in 2008,

1014
00:34:29.953 --> 00:34:32.684
six months before that he had a vasectomy.

1015
00:34:32.684 --> 00:34:34.817
<v Regina>And we talked about this,</v>

1016
00:34:34.817 --> 00:34:36.097
in the last interview.

1017
00:34:36.097 --> 00:34:37.357
And that's, you are finding,

1018
00:34:37.357 --> 00:34:39.191
there usually is this other trauma

1019
00:34:39.191 --> 00:34:40.621
preceding a lot of events.

1020
00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:41.709
<v ->Yes.</v>

1021
00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:42.945
<v Regina>I mean, when you go back,</v>

1022
00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:44.630
most of the people you see,

1023
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.337
do you find after they start doing

1024
00:34:46.337 --> 00:34:48.150
a little bit of detective work

1025
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.137
that the problem started after a surgery?

1026
00:34:51.137 --> 00:34:53.633
<v ->80% are so obvious it's incredible.</v>

1027
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.361
Their problem started within

1028
00:34:55.361 --> 00:34:56.982
six months to a year after surgery.

1029
00:34:56.982 --> 00:34:58.625
First thing i'll look at is the surgical history,

1030
00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:00.886
when did they start to develop,

1031
00:35:00.886 --> 00:35:01.931
when are the complaints,

1032
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:03.681
and you can see the match up so clearly.

1033
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:06.433
That my office staff, my secretaries,

1034
00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:08.395
can look at the history and say,

1035
00:35:08.395 --> 00:35:10.763
"Oh, yeah when they took the uterus out

1036
00:35:10.763 --> 00:35:12.086
"they did a hysterectomy--"

1037
00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:13.473
<v Regina>Now this has happened.</v>

1038
00:35:13.473 --> 00:35:14.710
<v ->Right, right.</v>

1039
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.867
<v Regina>Okay, so, a moment ago, I also wanted to clarify</v>

1040
00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:19.403
one other thing, when you said

1041
00:35:19.403 --> 00:35:20.652
"the scar starts pulling."

1042
00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:22.658
So you have your appendix scar starts pulling,

1043
00:35:22.658 --> 00:35:25.943
do you mean that energetically, physically,

1044
00:35:25.943 --> 00:35:28.119
all of the above? What happens?

1045
00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:31.127
<v ->The physical body to me is a magnificent machine</v>

1046
00:35:31.127 --> 00:35:33.751
created by God or nature or whatever,

1047
00:35:33.751 --> 00:35:35.244
it's magnificent.

1048
00:35:35.244 --> 00:35:36.652
We have a diaphragm in the pelvis,

1049
00:35:36.652 --> 00:35:37.655
we have one here,

1050
00:35:37.655 --> 00:35:38.849
we have one in our throat,

1051
00:35:38.849 --> 00:35:40.791
two in the brain that are constantly pumping.

1052
00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:42.476
The whole body is expanding,

1053
00:35:42.476 --> 00:35:43.735
contracting and breathing.

1054
00:35:43.735 --> 00:35:46.103
Now if I cut you in the belly.

1055
00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:49.025
That scar, as it starts to form,

1056
00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:50.861
pulls things tighter and tighter.

1057
00:35:50.861 --> 00:35:53.101
As it pulls it tighter and tighter now

1058
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:55.212
that pelvis diaphragm cannot pump.

1059
00:35:55.212 --> 00:35:56.748
And if it can't pump

1060
00:35:56.748 --> 00:35:59.457
then that air is going to get weaker and weaker.

1061
00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:00.781
It's not getting its circulation,

1062
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:02.572
it's supply to the area.

1063
00:36:02.572 --> 00:36:03.916
The breathing in the body,

1064
00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:05.537
the whole body is moving in breathing.

1065
00:36:05.537 --> 00:36:07.137
The only time that it stops moving in breathing

1066
00:36:07.137 --> 00:36:09.185
is something is dead or restricting it.

1067
00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:10.977
<v Regina>Yeah, so that makes sense.</v>

1068
00:36:10.977 --> 00:36:12.790
So when you have any kind of trauma

1069
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.094
like a surgical cut, you're

1070
00:36:15.094 --> 00:36:17.803
going to have a tightening and hardening in that area.

1071
00:36:17.803 --> 00:36:20.449
<v ->And the adhesions, the scaring pulls adhesions</v>

1072
00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:22.518
and pulls it and blocks that area, yes.

1073
00:36:23.518 --> 00:36:27.318
I cured 80% of diseases, one of two treatments,

1074
00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:29.946
by hitting the scars and treating the scars,

1075
00:36:29.946 --> 00:36:31.566
neuro-therapy it opens them up

1076
00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:33.251
and the patient limped into the office

1077
00:36:33.251 --> 00:36:34.744
and now walks out of the office.

1078
00:36:34.744 --> 00:36:36.152
Totally in disbelief.

1079
00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:38.776
<v Regina>Yeah, it is amazing isn't it?</v>

1080
00:36:38.776 --> 00:36:39.822
<v ->It's so much fun.</v>

1081
00:36:39.822 --> 00:36:41.678
Lyme disease, they blame it on the germ,

1082
00:36:41.678 --> 00:36:43.512
you can see it all the time.

1083
00:36:43.512 --> 00:36:44.494
<v Regina>So even though we talked</v>

1084
00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:45.838
about lyme disease a little bit last time

1085
00:36:45.838 --> 00:36:47.118
just please go ahead because it seems

1086
00:36:47.118 --> 00:36:49.400
like it's making the news more and more.

1087
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.808
<v ->Okay, well it's making the news more and more</v>

1088
00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:53.368
because doctors now are making less and less

1089
00:36:53.398 --> 00:36:54.933
and more surgeries are being done.

1090
00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:56.426
It's amount of surgeries.

1091
00:36:56.426 --> 00:36:58.730
20% of new physicians are going

1092
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.181
to plastic surgery.

1093
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:02.228
<v Regina>20%?</v>

1094
00:37:02.228 --> 00:37:05.130
<v ->20% of applicants are going to plastic surgery.</v>

1095
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.028
That's what they're wanting.

1096
00:37:07.028 --> 00:37:08.436
That's not medicine

1097
00:37:08.436 --> 00:37:10.740
that's barbaric cosmetology I call it.

1098
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.599
2% are going into general practice,

1099
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.327
into that type of thing.

1100
00:37:15.327 --> 00:37:17.268
But now a days, doctors,

1101
00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.466
when I went to medical school,

1102
00:37:19.466 --> 00:37:21.194
doctors made a lot of money.

1103
00:37:21.194 --> 00:37:24.052
They were very high in the middle income.

1104
00:37:24.052 --> 00:37:27.295
Now, because of insurances, they're not there,

1105
00:37:27.295 --> 00:37:30.580
so they need to, they're raising their bills

1106
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.647
as high as they can,

1107
00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:33.780
and surgery, surgery, let's do this,

1108
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.871
no big deal here, no big deal there.

1109
00:37:35.871 --> 00:37:37.407
It is a big deal,

1110
00:37:37.407 --> 00:37:38.623
just because you're asleep,

1111
00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:40.457
and don't feel the knife,

1112
00:37:40.457 --> 00:37:42.655
the body feels it,

1113
00:37:42.655 --> 00:37:44.255
the body knows it, the appendix,

1114
00:37:44.255 --> 00:37:45.876
when you put a knife in that belly,

1115
00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:46.750
they know it.

1116
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.606
30% of women have had hysterectomy

1117
00:37:48.606 --> 00:37:49.780
after the age of 50.

1118
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.697
You don't need it anymore.

1119
00:37:50.697 --> 00:37:51.977
<v Regina>And how many people giving birth</v>

1120
00:37:51.977 --> 00:37:53.321
what percentage have Cesarean?

1121
00:37:53.321 --> 00:37:56.201
<v ->That is another thing, 30% again.</v>

1122
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:58.484
In that area having c-sections.

1123
00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:00.412
<v Regina>Well we've been giving birth</v>

1124
00:38:00.412 --> 00:38:02.430
for many many thousands

1125
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.518
of tens of thousands

1126
00:38:03.518 --> 00:38:04.969
of hundreds of thousands of years

1127
00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:06.271
without the need for surgery.

1128
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.106
<v ->You know, if the creator wanted us</v>

1129
00:38:08.106 --> 00:38:09.556
to have a c-section he would put

1130
00:38:09.556 --> 00:38:11.092
a zipper on the belly or something like that.

1131
00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:12.927
<v Regina>I mean I can understand it in the case</v>

1132
00:38:12.927 --> 00:38:15.615
of having to save the life of the mother and baby.

1133
00:38:15.615 --> 00:38:16.596
<v ->Totally.</v>

1134
00:38:16.596 --> 00:38:17.535
<v Regina>And I was there.</v>

1135
00:38:17.535 --> 00:38:18.623
<v ->Right, and I understand that.</v>

1136
00:38:18.623 --> 00:38:21.140
But most of the time, if you have a good osteopath,

1137
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.594
they can manipulate, they keep the baby straight,

1138
00:38:23.594 --> 00:38:25.194
keep the baby lined up and

1139
00:38:25.194 --> 00:38:26.879
it's done that way.

1140
00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:29.055
And the purpose, the vaginal birth

1141
00:38:29.055 --> 00:38:31.423
is very important because the contractions

1142
00:38:31.423 --> 00:38:33.663
there are five diaphragms to the body,

1143
00:38:33.663 --> 00:38:35.860
that starts the diaphragms pumping.

1144
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.271
When you pull a kid out Cesarean,

1145
00:38:39.721 --> 00:38:41.193
the kid's limp,

1146
00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:43.062
he never get's that good first breath.

1147
00:38:43.062 --> 00:38:45.174
Totally a different ball here.

1148
00:38:45.174 --> 00:38:47.201
They're running behind the eight-ball

1149
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:49.947
by being pulled out Cesarean.

1150
00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Regina>So let's go back for a moment to lyme disease,</v>

1151
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.996
so as you seen in people,

1152
00:38:53.996 --> 00:38:55.042
wherever there's lyme disease,

1153
00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.599
you've usually seen previous surgeries

1154
00:38:56.599 --> 00:38:58.348
in the individual most of the time.

1155
00:38:58.348 --> 00:39:00.183
And so how does this end up

1156
00:39:00.183 --> 00:39:02.145
as a diagnosis of lyme disease?

1157
00:39:02.145 --> 00:39:04.876
Does it just make a more fertile ground?

1158
00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:07.692
<v ->What it is, there's two theories,</v>

1159
00:39:07.692 --> 00:39:09.484
the germ cause disease,

1160
00:39:09.484 --> 00:39:12.492
and germs live in disease bodies is the other theory.

1161
00:39:12.492 --> 00:39:14.775
Now, according to Pasteur,

1162
00:39:14.775 --> 00:39:16.332
what he really said is a strep

1163
00:39:16.332 --> 00:39:17.377
is always a strep.

1164
00:39:17.377 --> 00:39:18.401
You have strep in your throat,

1165
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:19.447
I have strep in my throat,

1166
00:39:19.447 --> 00:39:20.364
we all have strep,

1167
00:39:20.364 --> 00:39:21.836
how can we not have strep throat?

1168
00:39:21.836 --> 00:39:23.350
Now in life everything changes.

1169
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.356
Trees change, grass changes,

1170
00:39:25.356 --> 00:39:27.190
we grow, everything grows,

1171
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.025
so why doesn't a germ change?

1172
00:39:29.025 --> 00:39:30.412
It does.

1173
00:39:30.412 --> 00:39:32.908
Royal Rife did years ago

1174
00:39:32.908 --> 00:39:35.212
he took an e-coli germ and he grew it

1175
00:39:35.212 --> 00:39:36.406
in a culture plate.

1176
00:39:36.406 --> 00:39:38.860
And he changed the pH of the culture plate.

1177
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.673
Changed the oxygen, and low and behold,

1178
00:39:40.673 --> 00:39:42.187
it became a thyroid bacteria.

1179
00:39:42.187 --> 00:39:44.406
And as he kept on changing the pH,

1180
00:39:44.406 --> 00:39:46.091
it morphed itself into a germ

1181
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:47.670
that created cancer.

1182
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.273
If he put the pH back to the standard one

1183
00:39:50.273 --> 00:39:52.619
it went back to it's normal e. coli.

1184
00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:54.625
Germs change and adapt.

1185
00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.481
So it goes on the body,

1186
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:59.083
it you get a cut someplace, surgery.

1187
00:39:59.083 --> 00:40:00.491
Now, surgery's a block,

1188
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:02.027
it sets up a stagnant pond.

1189
00:40:02.027 --> 00:40:05.163
In the stagnant pond the germs are growing.

1190
00:40:05.163 --> 00:40:07.360
It's not the germs,

1191
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.963
it's the stagnation that's creating the problem.

1192
00:40:09.963 --> 00:40:13.675
The germ just want it's food.

1193
00:40:13.675 --> 00:40:14.763
Now it's stagnant,

1194
00:40:14.763 --> 00:40:15.702
it's not getting its food,

1195
00:40:15.702 --> 00:40:17.771
it changes it's waste products to

1196
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:20.200
bring in a fever so more circulation

1197
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.867
will come in so the germ can get his food.

1198
00:40:21.867 --> 00:40:24.132
It's not doing anything negative,

1199
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.375
it's trying to survive.

1200
00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:27.466
It doesn't want to kill the host.

1201
00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:29.362
If it kills the host, it dies.

1202
00:40:29.362 --> 00:40:30.941
<v Regina>So you've seen a lot of lyme</v>

1203
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:33.032
in the last couple of years since I last saw you?

1204
00:40:33.032 --> 00:40:36.999
<v ->Lyme disease is increasing geometrically, okay?</v>

1205
00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:40.455
I'm seeing I would say three out of every four

1206
00:40:40.455 --> 00:40:42.823
new patients are lyme cases.

1207
00:40:42.823 --> 00:40:45.063
And again, I could tell the secretary in the office,

1208
00:40:45.063 --> 00:40:46.706
looks at the sheet and says,

1209
00:40:46.706 --> 00:40:48.967
"Oh, there it is, very obvious."

1210
00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:50.439
You look at them, 80%

1211
00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:52.295
it's so simply incredible to diagnose

1212
00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:54.195
where their weakening began.

1213
00:40:54.195 --> 00:40:55.964
I look at the body like an eights on the car

1214
00:40:55.964 --> 00:40:58.588
but what happened in lyme

1215
00:40:58.588 --> 00:41:00.828
is some doctors thrown away

1216
00:41:00.828 --> 00:41:01.882
two or three syllabuses.

1217
00:41:01.882 --> 00:41:02.522
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1218
00:41:02.522 --> 00:41:04.101
<v ->And now the germ is going in that,</v>

1219
00:41:04.101 --> 00:41:05.850
and they say you have chronic fatigue,

1220
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.322
you have lyme, etc.

1221
00:41:07.322 --> 00:41:10.565
And all these people are treating lyme disease,

1222
00:41:10.565 --> 00:41:13.786
traditional people don't even think is such a disease.

1223
00:41:13.786 --> 00:41:15.791
They think people lied.

1224
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:17.583
By the way I've never had a patient

1225
00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:19.055
come in and pay me money and lie.

1226
00:41:19.055 --> 00:41:20.293
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:41:20.293 --> 00:41:21.658
<v ->Medical doctors do think that,</v>

1228
00:41:21.658 --> 00:41:23.429
that the patient is making it up.

1229
00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:25.093
The alternative doctors are treating the germ,

1230
00:41:25.093 --> 00:41:27.311
with natural stuff, but it's not the germ,

1231
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:28.826
it's the stagnation.

1232
00:41:28.826 --> 00:41:30.618
That's the key.

1233
00:41:30.618 --> 00:41:32.068
The first thing you got to do

1234
00:41:32.068 --> 00:41:34.180
is break the stagnation and open the body up

1235
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.375
and let it respirate,

1236
00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:37.636
the body heals itself better than anything.

1237
00:41:37.636 --> 00:41:39.684
You just got to get things going

1238
00:41:39.684 --> 00:41:41.050
in the right direction.

1239
00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:44.399
<v Regina>So, obviously, it wouldn't be</v>

1240
00:41:44.399 --> 00:41:45.978
just lyme disease with the increase

1241
00:41:45.978 --> 00:41:50.649
in both, through disease, or whatever

1242
00:41:50.649 --> 00:41:52.804
you want to call it, dysfunction of some kind,

1243
00:41:52.804 --> 00:41:55.385
with the increase in surgeries that are occurring.

1244
00:41:55.385 --> 00:41:59.076
And also elective surgeries that are occurring.

1245
00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:00.868
You must be seeing an increase

1246
00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:03.023
in pretty much everything across the board then.

1247
00:42:03.023 --> 00:42:05.967
<v ->This is why the US keeps on dropping in longevity,</v>

1248
00:42:05.967 --> 00:42:08.591
our healthcare, we keep getting less and less.

1249
00:42:08.591 --> 00:42:11.598
Because doctors are doing more and more surgeries.

1250
00:42:11.598 --> 00:42:15.076
To me when I was a traditional MD,

1251
00:42:15.076 --> 00:42:18.084
I was taught surgery is the last thing you do.

1252
00:42:18.084 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Regina>Now it's almost the first resort.</v>

1253
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.220
<v ->Now it's the first thing you do.</v>

1254
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.094
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:42:22.094 --> 00:42:25.252
<v ->And some of the surgeries, like you said,</v>

1256
00:42:25.252 --> 00:42:27.620
cosmetic surgery is just barbaric.

1257
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.686
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:42:28.686 --> 00:42:30.137
<v ->Some of the surgery they're doing now</v>

1259
00:42:30.137 --> 00:42:33.059
is so ridiculous and I can't,

1260
00:42:33.059 --> 00:42:35.961
you can operate on one little vessel

1261
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:37.731
over here that that has nothing

1262
00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:38.947
to do with the chest, you're missing

1263
00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:41.102
the whole reason why and

1264
00:42:41.102 --> 00:42:44.025
you're cutting this great creation apart arrogantly.

1265
00:42:44.025 --> 00:42:45.326
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:42:45.326 --> 00:42:47.310
<v ->Arrogant. I mean the arrogance of the system,</v>

1267
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.635
no big deal, we'll put a knife in you.

1268
00:42:49.635 --> 00:42:51.449
It's a big deal.

1269
00:42:51.449 --> 00:42:53.262
<v Regina>Yeah, it's a big deal.</v>

1270
00:42:53.262 --> 00:42:55.011
So let's talk about some of the things

1271
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:57.144
since I last saw you that are coming around

1272
00:42:57.144 --> 00:42:59.342
that you've been excited about.

1273
00:42:59.342 --> 00:43:00.366
Some of the kind of,

1274
00:43:00.366 --> 00:43:02.904
maybe a couple of new findings,

1275
00:43:02.904 --> 00:43:04.931
in a couple of cases, surprising results.

1276
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:07.171
<v ->Well, first of all, new things that are coming about,</v>

1277
00:43:07.171 --> 00:43:09.091
I'm very excited with some

1278
00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:10.243
of my new treatments.

1279
00:43:10.243 --> 00:43:11.928
My treatments, I get my remedies,

1280
00:43:11.928 --> 00:43:14.147
mainly from Germany and from France,

1281
00:43:14.147 --> 00:43:17.752
the French have been doing pig embryonic

1282
00:43:17.752 --> 00:43:20.824
stem cells, porcine embryonic stem cells for 20 years.

1283
00:43:20.824 --> 00:43:23.661
And they made the molecule so small

1284
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:26.925
that you could drink it and the FDA

1285
00:43:26.925 --> 00:43:29.144
lets it in as a food stuff.

1286
00:43:29.144 --> 00:43:31.171
And the first time that I tried that,

1287
00:43:31.171 --> 00:43:32.792
I gave some brain material

1288
00:43:32.792 --> 00:43:34.200
to an Alzheimer's patient,

1289
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.461
as I walked in to see another case,

1290
00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:37.848
she was sitting in the waiting,

1291
00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.832
waiting with her daughter.

1292
00:43:39.832 --> 00:43:41.773
I gave her some of the brain cells,

1293
00:43:41.773 --> 00:43:43.394
I walked in saw my patient,

1294
00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:45.080
came out a half hour later,

1295
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.253
and she looked at me,

1296
00:43:46.253 --> 00:43:48.088
she goes, "Dr. Bigelsen what am I doing here?"

1297
00:43:48.088 --> 00:43:49.709
<v Regina>Really?</v>

1298
00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:52.589
<v ->I mean it just, this with the stem cells.</v>

1299
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:54.296
And you can see it happening in the blood.

1300
00:43:54.296 --> 00:43:56.173
They get in the blood fast.

1301
00:43:56.173 --> 00:43:59.245
I'm so astounded first time I saw it.

1302
00:43:59.245 --> 00:44:00.781
My first stem cell case was a gal

1303
00:44:00.781 --> 00:44:03.213
that was a quadriplegic, like Christoper Reeve,

1304
00:44:03.213 --> 00:44:05.431
and we did this in Mexico,

1305
00:44:05.431 --> 00:44:07.074
but we used actually brain tissue

1306
00:44:07.074 --> 00:44:09.591
which we got from a cadaver

1307
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:12.194
and we used it on her spinal cord back.

1308
00:44:12.194 --> 00:44:15.607
Now the French are doing it with pig cells.

1309
00:44:15.607 --> 00:44:16.951
It's incredible,

1310
00:44:16.951 --> 00:44:18.701
stem cell to me is the future.

1311
00:44:18.701 --> 00:44:20.620
The US does it everything,

1312
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.120
what I call Las Vegas Glitz and Gloss.

1313
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.022
If you want stem cell transplant in the US,

1314
00:44:26.022 --> 00:44:27.872
it's going to cost you a quarter of a million dollars.

1315
00:44:27.872 --> 00:44:31.559
You want to get the stem cells from France, 100 bucks.

1316
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:34.871
Big difference.

1317
00:44:34.871 --> 00:44:36.322
And you drink the darn things

1318
00:44:36.322 --> 00:44:37.709
and they work.

1319
00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:42.807
<v Regina>And the porcine part is really important.</v>

1320
00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:45.874
It's more biocompatible with the--

1321
00:44:45.874 --> 00:44:47.090
<v ->It's very compatible, right.</v>

1322
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.583
<v Regina>with the human, feel.</v>

1323
00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:52.014
<v ->I have seen, I have done now for</v>

1324
00:44:52.014 --> 00:44:53.785
over a year on this stuff and I have seen

1325
00:44:53.785 --> 00:44:55.748
no negative effects on them.

1326
00:44:55.748 --> 00:44:58.755
<v Regina>So there's no need to even explore</v>

1327
00:44:58.755 --> 00:45:01.038
the subject then, of human stem cells,

1328
00:45:01.038 --> 00:45:02.361
any further is there?

1329
00:45:02.361 --> 00:45:03.854
<v ->I don't think it's necessary, no.</v>

1330
00:45:03.854 --> 00:45:06.158
<v Regina>So doesn't that take all the moral</v>

1331
00:45:06.158 --> 00:45:10.126
ethical issues that surrounded it out of it?

1332
00:45:10.126 --> 00:45:12.494
Or like you say, a great number of them out of the question?

1333
00:45:12.494 --> 00:45:15.267
<v ->But the US does everything big and fancy.</v>

1334
00:45:15.267 --> 00:45:17.528
So we got to do it, I'm reading about

1335
00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:19.128
how they're taking one brother and

1336
00:45:19.128 --> 00:45:20.622
they're going to use bone marrow transplant

1337
00:45:20.622 --> 00:45:22.264
from that one to that one

1338
00:45:22.264 --> 00:45:23.800
for a quarter million dollars.

1339
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.528
The US likes to do everything

1340
00:45:25.528 --> 00:45:28.515
big and fancy and make it expensive.

1341
00:45:28.515 --> 00:45:30.008
<v Regina>So let's talk about that.</v>

1342
00:45:30.008 --> 00:45:31.736
Say the taking out of one brother

1343
00:45:31.736 --> 00:45:33.294
to put into the other, the bone marrow.

1344
00:45:33.294 --> 00:45:34.552
What is the possibility

1345
00:45:34.552 --> 00:45:35.598
if you have stem cells,

1346
00:45:35.598 --> 00:45:37.560
porcine stem cells in a situation like that.

1347
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.568
<v ->It's really, honestly, I've regenerated bone marrow</v>

1348
00:45:40.568 --> 00:45:42.531
with stuff with the porcine stem cells.

1349
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:44.579
I've regenerated just about everything

1350
00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:45.987
with patients, you can see them.

1351
00:45:45.987 --> 00:45:47.608
They come in, their liver tests are off,

1352
00:45:47.608 --> 00:45:49.891
I treat their problems, give them that,

1353
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:51.747
you can see their liver tests are changing.

1354
00:45:51.747 --> 00:45:54.072
Their breathing tests will change

1355
00:45:54.072 --> 00:45:55.779
their cardiogram will change

1356
00:45:55.779 --> 00:45:57.165
the blood pressure will change.

1357
00:45:57.165 --> 00:45:58.723
Stem cells are the future.

1358
00:45:58.723 --> 00:46:02.200
I'm 70 years old now,

1359
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.357
every day old cells are dying in my body

1360
00:46:05.357 --> 00:46:06.594
and new cells are being born.

1361
00:46:06.594 --> 00:46:09.197
But they are being born to fit a 70 year old

1362
00:46:09.197 --> 00:46:12.034
when I take the stem cells,

1363
00:46:12.034 --> 00:46:14.914
they are now being born to fit a 50 year old.

1364
00:46:14.914 --> 00:46:17.154
<v Regina>So now people are starting</v>

1365
00:46:17.154 --> 00:46:18.626
to talk about questions having to do

1366
00:46:18.626 --> 00:46:21.335
with enhanced life spans, and not immortality

1367
00:46:21.335 --> 00:46:25.154
exactly but enhanced life spans, enhanced quality of life.

1368
00:46:25.154 --> 00:46:27.842
And for you it's more of a quality of life issue.

1369
00:46:27.842 --> 00:46:29.826
<v ->Right, I do not want to be infirmed,</v>

1370
00:46:29.826 --> 00:46:32.663
it's a quality of life, that's why I'm doing this, yes.

1371
00:46:32.663 --> 00:46:35.671
<v Regina>So can you tell us some of the,</v>

1372
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:37.527
because stem cells because,

1373
00:46:37.527 --> 00:46:39.341
people are curious about it, and very excited

1374
00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:40.663
about this potential.

1375
00:46:40.663 --> 00:46:41.773
And now that you say,

1376
00:46:41.773 --> 00:46:46.225
is this under threat to be banned in the US?

1377
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:50.839
<v ->The US is so arrogant,</v>

1378
00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:53.420
I don't think they see these things yet happening.

1379
00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.700
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

1380
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.066
<v ->I'm probably one of the few peole</v>

1381
00:46:56.066 --> 00:46:57.239
that's doing this work.

1382
00:46:57.239 --> 00:46:59.607
I know a gal that's importing them in Florida

1383
00:46:59.607 --> 00:47:01.058
and I'm getting it from her, and she

1384
00:47:01.058 --> 00:47:04.001
keeps saying, "tell some more people"

1385
00:47:04.001 --> 00:47:05.623
it's like, "they don't believe me."

1386
00:47:05.623 --> 00:47:07.948
And she's been playing the game twenty years.

1387
00:47:07.948 --> 00:47:09.335
<v Regina>Well this is exciting.</v>

1388
00:47:09.335 --> 00:47:10.828
What are some of the conditions

1389
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.513
that people have come here with?

1390
00:47:12.513 --> 00:47:13.708
That you have been able to help

1391
00:47:13.708 --> 00:47:15.031
their bodies reverse?

1392
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:17.868
<v ->Well one the other day, was a great one,</v>

1393
00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:19.340
was an MS case.

1394
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.260
And she could move her feet,

1395
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.284
but she couldn't stand.

1396
00:47:22.284 --> 00:47:22.967
She was in a wheelchair,

1397
00:47:22.967 --> 00:47:25.121
her legs were waisted to a certain degree.

1398
00:47:25.121 --> 00:47:26.230
She could move her toes,

1399
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.345
and it all happened, a lot of it happened,

1400
00:47:29.345 --> 00:47:32.758
after disc surgery and lumbar disc surgery.

1401
00:47:32.758 --> 00:47:34.977
We treated the lumbar disc surgery

1402
00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:37.025
and then I gave her spinal good stem cells.

1403
00:47:37.025 --> 00:47:39.713
She stood up.

1404
00:47:39.713 --> 00:47:43.126
In my office, she hadn't stood up in ten years.

1405
00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.556
<v Regina>Now does this hold,</v>

1406
00:47:44.556 --> 00:47:46.539
or is it just a passing effect?

1407
00:47:46.539 --> 00:47:47.713
<v ->She's going to get better.</v>

1408
00:47:47.713 --> 00:47:49.206
The stem cells, when I give you the stem cells,

1409
00:47:49.206 --> 00:47:50.443
they take the stimulated body,

1410
00:47:50.443 --> 00:47:52.171
regenerate over the next eight months,

1411
00:47:52.171 --> 00:47:55.877
so it's going to continue to regenerate.

1412
00:47:56.225 --> 00:47:57.590
I'll bet next time she comes into

1413
00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.659
the office she will have no wheelchair.

1414
00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:01.345
I remember my first one,

1415
00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:02.859
a bad lyme case.

1416
00:48:02.859 --> 00:48:06.102
She came in, the mother carried her out of the van.

1417
00:48:06.102 --> 00:48:08.320
She was 17 years old, she weighed 93 pounds,

1418
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.878
put her in her wheelchair and moved her.

1419
00:48:09.878 --> 00:48:11.648
Came into the office that way.

1420
00:48:11.648 --> 00:48:12.992
By the end of the week

1421
00:48:12.992 --> 00:48:15.019
she was dancing with the wheelchair

1422
00:48:15.019 --> 00:48:17.152
holding it and walking around

1423
00:48:17.152 --> 00:48:19.008
and just joking.

1424
00:48:19.008 --> 00:48:21.782
She's now completely off her medication

1425
00:48:21.782 --> 00:48:24.064
she's up to 113 pounds,

1426
00:48:24.064 --> 00:48:26.262
she's going to be going to school.

1427
00:48:26.262 --> 00:48:28.395
And it was the stem cells that

1428
00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:30.400
pulled her right back up.

1429
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.851
But it was the difference between

1430
00:48:31.851 --> 00:48:33.813
one week in a wheelchair, you see it,

1431
00:48:33.813 --> 00:48:35.157
and at the end of the week,

1432
00:48:35.157 --> 00:48:37.184
she was running around the office,

1433
00:48:37.184 --> 00:48:39.019
pushing the wheelchair around and laughing,

1434
00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:40.064
<v Regina>What about,</v>

1435
00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:41.515
I'm going to ask you about a few things

1436
00:48:41.515 --> 00:48:43.264
if there's any history in these areas

1437
00:48:43.264 --> 00:48:45.525
because this is very, I'm sure people

1438
00:48:45.525 --> 00:48:47.680
listening to this, this is very hopeful information.

1439
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.939
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

1440
00:48:48.939 --> 00:48:50.325
<v Regina>Especially in the sea</v>

1441
00:48:50.325 --> 00:48:54.250
in the problems that face them in the medical industry.

1442
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:56.704
And that is, what about eyes?

1443
00:48:56.704 --> 00:48:59.968
Can anything be done like glaucoma

1444
00:48:59.968 --> 00:49:01.397
or any of these kinds of.

1445
00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:03.104
<v ->I think so. I got stem cells for the eyes, I bet.</v>

1446
00:49:03.104 --> 00:49:05.258
I don't have a glaucoma case.

1447
00:49:05.258 --> 00:49:06.453
<v Regina>You haven't had to do it with, yeah.</v>

1448
00:49:06.453 --> 00:49:07.541
<v ->I haven't had to do it with that.</v>

1449
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:11.637
There's no reason why, glaucoma has narrow angles on it,

1450
00:49:11.637 --> 00:49:13.898
there's a tightness in the eye.

1451
00:49:13.898 --> 00:49:17.354
But I'll bet the stem cells would really help that

1452
00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:19.743
and make, because they make everything younger.

1453
00:49:19.743 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Regina>What about bone loss?</v>

1454
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.751
And teeth and mouth?

1455
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:24.415
<v ->Oh, bone loss it's great.</v>

1456
00:49:24.415 --> 00:49:25.951
Osteoporosis, big difference.

1457
00:49:25.951 --> 00:49:27.402
I've actually had people,

1458
00:49:27.402 --> 00:49:29.578
you'll see the difference on the x-rays.

1459
00:49:29.578 --> 00:49:30.709
<v Regina>Really?</v>

1460
00:49:30.709 --> 00:49:32.394
What about bone loss in the mouth

1461
00:49:32.394 --> 00:49:34.463
for people as they age they tend to

1462
00:49:34.463 --> 00:49:37.236
a lot of people tend to have bone loss.

1463
00:49:37.236 --> 00:49:39.498
<v ->Bone loss all over, wherever it is,</v>

1464
00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:42.186
it'll, like I have some implants in here,

1465
00:49:42.186 --> 00:49:43.850
but basically, some of the things

1466
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.471
that happened to me is

1467
00:49:45.471 --> 00:49:47.476
I also they were pretty well stunned

1468
00:49:47.476 --> 00:49:49.290
that I took some bone stuff beforehand

1469
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.615
and my bones were so solid

1470
00:49:51.615 --> 00:49:53.748
that implants were a six month process.

1471
00:49:53.748 --> 00:49:55.860
They couldn't believe how much

1472
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.465
my bones grew and how much my jaw changed

1473
00:49:59.465 --> 00:50:01.172
as they took the bones cells.

1474
00:50:01.172 --> 00:50:04.223
<v Regina>So it helps with bone, yes.</v>

1475
00:50:04.223 --> 00:50:06.057
We already talked about heart.

1476
00:50:06.057 --> 00:50:07.327
It helps with heart.

1477
00:50:07.327 --> 00:50:08.245
<v ->I've cured ulcers,</v>

1478
00:50:08.245 --> 00:50:09.760
I've cured intestinal diseases with it.

1479
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.978
<v Regina>Colon diseases?</v>

1480
00:50:11.978 --> 00:50:14.154
<v ->I myself was operated on when I was 3 weeks old.</v>

1481
00:50:14.154 --> 00:50:15.968
They started off on me.

1482
00:50:15.968 --> 00:50:17.482
I've always had an intestinal stress.

1483
00:50:17.482 --> 00:50:19.285
Not anymore, I can eat foods

1484
00:50:19.285 --> 00:50:21.503
that I haven't eaten in 20 years.

1485
00:50:21.503 --> 00:50:22.762
<v Regina>That's fabulous.</v>

1486
00:50:22.762 --> 00:50:24.469
<v ->Because of these stem cells.</v>

1487
00:50:24.469 --> 00:50:27.434
It's made my system much more efficient.

1488
00:50:27.434 --> 00:50:30.207
<v Regina>What about severe cases of arthritis?</v>

1489
00:50:30.207 --> 00:50:32.298
<v ->I can essentially,</v>

1490
00:50:32.298 --> 00:50:34.069
we can start to get them moving.

1491
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:36.863
Arthritis is a rusty joint.

1492
00:50:36.863 --> 00:50:38.655
You got to start to get the joint lubricated,

1493
00:50:38.655 --> 00:50:40.596
so there's bone and joint material

1494
00:50:40.596 --> 00:50:41.898
that I can use,

1495
00:50:41.898 --> 00:50:43.263
that starts to separate.

1496
00:50:43.263 --> 00:50:44.287
Then you have to do

1497
00:50:44.287 --> 00:50:45.439
osteopath manipulation,

1498
00:50:45.439 --> 00:50:47.956
get the bones away, so it's separated.

1499
00:50:47.956 --> 00:50:50.239
And it regenerates fast.

1500
00:50:50.239 --> 00:50:52.095
If you break a leg it regenerates,

1501
00:50:52.095 --> 00:50:53.076
the bone regenerates.

1502
00:50:53.076 --> 00:50:54.164
<v Regina>Sure, yeah,</v>

1503
00:50:54.164 --> 00:50:55.764
<v ->Well, there it goes.</v>

1504
00:50:55.764 --> 00:50:58.026
Everything regenerates in the body but the nervous system.

1505
00:50:58.026 --> 00:50:59.476
But we're finding through

1506
00:50:59.476 --> 00:51:01.076
if I can pull people out of Alzheimers

1507
00:51:01.076 --> 00:51:03.935
and there's some life left in the nervous system

1508
00:51:03.935 --> 00:51:05.556
we can regenerate it.

1509
00:51:05.556 --> 00:51:06.985
<v Regina>What about cancers?</v>

1510
00:51:06.985 --> 00:51:08.287
<v ->Cancer is a different story.</v>

1511
00:51:08.287 --> 00:51:09.759
Cancer is a mold.

1512
00:51:09.759 --> 00:51:11.337
They say.

1513
00:51:11.337 --> 00:51:12.596
<v Regina>And that's controversial.</v>

1514
00:51:12.596 --> 00:51:13.407
<v ->Well, you know,</v>

1515
00:51:13.407 --> 00:51:14.345
<v Regina>Right?</v>

1516
00:51:14.345 --> 00:51:15.647
<v ->to me it's not controversial,</v>

1517
00:51:15.647 --> 00:51:16.649
to me it's so obvious its incredible.

1518
00:51:16.649 --> 00:51:19.039
<v Regina>I know, but on the outside it's controversial.</v>

1519
00:51:19.039 --> 00:51:20.319
<v ->Yeah it's controversial because</v>

1520
00:51:20.319 --> 00:51:22.111
they keep on looking for genes that cause it

1521
00:51:22.111 --> 00:51:24.009
which is mathematically stupid.

1522
00:51:24.009 --> 00:51:25.673
<v Regina>And now tell me what convinced you</v>

1523
00:51:25.673 --> 00:51:27.977
it was a mold.

1524
00:51:27.977 --> 00:51:29.726
<v ->The way it spreads.</v>

1525
00:51:29.726 --> 00:51:31.604
Every cancer, it's not random.

1526
00:51:31.604 --> 00:51:32.926
They say it's one cell that goes wild.

1527
00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:35.678
Breast cancer, they skyrocketed breast cancer

1528
00:51:35.678 --> 00:51:38.324
when they gave women hormonal therapy

1529
00:51:38.324 --> 00:51:40.969
for menopause and then they told the women

1530
00:51:40.969 --> 00:51:42.889
that you're going to get osteoporosis.

1531
00:51:42.889 --> 00:51:45.747
They gave them calcium to fix the bones.

1532
00:51:45.747 --> 00:51:47.603
Well the major food source for breast cancer

1533
00:51:47.603 --> 00:51:48.905
is calcium.

1534
00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:51.550
And breast cancer will go to 20 spots

1535
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:54.003
in the bones first before it goes any place else.

1536
00:51:54.003 --> 00:51:56.585
Now they say it's one cell that breaks off

1537
00:51:56.585 --> 00:52:00.233
gets into a vessel, circulates and randomly stops

1538
00:52:00.233 --> 00:52:01.875
some places and grows.

1539
00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:04.243
No, not if breast cancer gets transpoted

1540
00:52:04.243 --> 00:52:06.760
to the bones and no place else.

1541
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.534
There's no such thing as randomness in nature.

1542
00:52:09.534 --> 00:52:11.475
So when I see,

1543
00:52:11.475 --> 00:52:13.971
when I'm looking at a cancer case.

1544
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:16.211
First of all, it's a mold.

1545
00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:17.598
If I have a mold of cream cheese,

1546
00:52:17.598 --> 00:52:19.262
and I cut the mold up in twelve spots,

1547
00:52:19.262 --> 00:52:21.907
the whole cream cheese is rotten.

1548
00:52:21.907 --> 00:52:23.422
So if you starting a breast cancer

1549
00:52:23.422 --> 00:52:24.339
or a colon cancer,

1550
00:52:24.339 --> 00:52:27.709
already the cream cheese is rotting pretty good.

1551
00:52:27.709 --> 00:52:29.821
The nice thing with stem cells,

1552
00:52:29.821 --> 00:52:32.275
what we're doing is I do recommend chemo

1553
00:52:32.275 --> 00:52:34.003
and stuff like that, because

1554
00:52:34.003 --> 00:52:35.965
the cancer produces a poison,

1555
00:52:35.965 --> 00:52:37.160
the mold produces a poison,

1556
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.675
that destroys the body,

1557
00:52:38.675 --> 00:52:40.061
but I'll use very very low doses,

1558
00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:42.387
then I use stem cells to regenerate.

1559
00:52:42.387 --> 00:52:45.587
And since then we have had some remarkable

1560
00:52:45.587 --> 00:52:48.296
changes on that putting life back

1561
00:52:48.296 --> 00:52:50.365
in the system, cancer is anti-life.

1562
00:52:50.365 --> 00:52:52.349
<v Regina>And that's not just breast cancer,</v>

1563
00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:53.565
but other forms of cancer.

1564
00:52:53.565 --> 00:52:54.930
<v ->All cancer is anti-life.</v>

1565
00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.853
<v Regina>Right, but I mean what you say.</v>

1566
00:52:57.853 --> 00:53:00.221
in terms of using stem cells as a,

1567
00:53:00.221 --> 00:53:03.421
not back up, but a secondary,

1568
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.000
a complimentary.

1569
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.472
<v ->It's very complimentary,</v>

1570
00:53:06.472 --> 00:53:10.482
there's two local oncologists in this town

1571
00:53:10.482 --> 00:53:13.746
and I send them my patients for chemo.

1572
00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:15.154
A lot of patients dont want it

1573
00:53:15.154 --> 00:53:16.434
but I say, "No you gotta get some"

1574
00:53:16.434 --> 00:53:18.098
But one of the patients came back the other day,

1575
00:53:18.098 --> 00:53:19.762
and the oncologist says,

1576
00:53:19.762 --> 00:53:21.597
"What is this guy doing?

1577
00:53:21.597 --> 00:53:23.431
"Because you're better than any

1578
00:53:23.431 --> 00:53:24.562
"of my other cases.

1579
00:53:24.562 --> 00:53:25.949
"How come his patients are always

1580
00:53:25.949 --> 00:53:27.634
"better than everyone else's?"

1581
00:53:27.634 --> 00:53:29.554
<v Regina>Yeah, well what about the notion</v>

1582
00:53:29.554 --> 00:53:31.474
that, I just have to ask you this because

1583
00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.458
a lot of people listening will be shocked

1584
00:53:33.458 --> 00:53:35.036
that you would say you would reccomend

1585
00:53:35.036 --> 00:53:36.508
that someone have chemo when it has such

1586
00:53:36.508 --> 00:53:39.452
a destructive effect on the immune system.

1587
00:53:39.452 --> 00:53:42.226
Why would you say that chemo is an option?

1588
00:53:42.226 --> 00:53:43.570
<v ->First of all, I don't throw the baby</v>

1589
00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:44.956
out with the bathwater.

1590
00:53:44.956 --> 00:53:46.023
I can integrate them,

1591
00:53:46.023 --> 00:53:47.538
they can't integrate me.

1592
00:53:47.538 --> 00:53:49.564
Cancer's a mold, and that mold

1593
00:53:49.564 --> 00:53:52.465
is creating a poison which is destroying the body.

1594
00:53:52.465 --> 00:53:54.471
Pancreas cancer is the size

1595
00:53:54.471 --> 00:53:56.967
of a pinky now, and you can die from that.

1596
00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:58.375
So it's not obstruction,

1597
00:53:58.375 --> 00:53:59.783
it's the poison from the cancer.

1598
00:53:59.783 --> 00:54:02.279
So you have to get rid of it.

1599
00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:03.601
If you can't cut it out,

1600
00:54:03.601 --> 00:54:06.439
I'm not against using those poisons

1601
00:54:06.439 --> 00:54:08.977
because I can regenerate the tissues.

1602
00:54:08.977 --> 00:54:10.727
And I use them, they'll tell you

1603
00:54:10.727 --> 00:54:12.391
to use the poisons for up to six weeks,

1604
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:13.521
when I studied blood,

1605
00:54:13.521 --> 00:54:15.185
I start to use the chemo,

1606
00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:16.977
as soon as I can see the cancer

1607
00:54:16.977 --> 00:54:18.428
dying in the blood,

1608
00:54:18.428 --> 00:54:20.028
I immediately back off the chemo.

1609
00:54:20.028 --> 00:54:22.118
<v Regina>Right, and then the stem cells take over.</v>

1610
00:54:22.118 --> 00:54:24.102
<v ->The stem cells take over more and more.</v>

1611
00:54:24.102 --> 00:54:26.300
<v Regina>And are you having good success with this?</v>

1612
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:31.078
<v ->Yes. I'm getting very exciting success with it.</v>

1613
00:54:31.078 --> 00:54:34.748
I think stem cells are by far the future.

1614
00:54:34.748 --> 00:54:38.139
And I looked at myself in first grade

1615
00:54:38.139 --> 00:54:40.337
but still more than anyone in North America.

1616
00:54:40.337 --> 00:54:42.854
The potential of what's going on

1617
00:54:42.854 --> 00:54:43.942
with these stem cells.

1618
00:54:43.942 --> 00:54:45.073
The US by the way, will give you

1619
00:54:45.073 --> 00:54:46.843
brain stem cell, they'll drill a hole in your brain.

1620
00:54:46.843 --> 00:54:49.019
In your skull to put it in there.

1621
00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.107
No, I'll give it to you orally.

1622
00:54:50.107 --> 00:54:53.563
<v Regina>So now what would make you think</v>

1623
00:54:53.563 --> 00:54:55.697
that while you're doing this

1624
00:54:55.697 --> 00:54:56.699
the same thing is not going to

1625
00:54:56.699 --> 00:54:58.214
happen to you again?

1626
00:54:58.214 --> 00:55:00.219
It happened when you were doing homeopathy,

1627
00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:02.374
and other treatments.

1628
00:55:02.374 --> 00:55:03.312
<v ->Well, number one,</v>

1629
00:55:03.312 --> 00:55:05.574
they took away my license. I don't have a license now,

1630
00:55:05.574 --> 00:55:06.960
<v Regina>That's true you have nothing to lose.</v>

1631
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.496
<v ->I have nothing to lose.</v>

1632
00:55:08.496 --> 00:55:09.584
The only thing they can do me is

1633
00:55:09.584 --> 00:55:11.184
what I call assassinate me,

1634
00:55:11.184 --> 00:55:12.251
because they can't throw me out

1635
00:55:12.251 --> 00:55:15.131
I have nothing to lose, everything I do

1636
00:55:15.131 --> 00:55:16.710
is totally natural, considered food stuff,

1637
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.860
there's nothing they can do about it.

1638
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.735
<v Regina>But what does that mean</v>

1639
00:55:20.735 --> 00:55:23.828
for the potential growth for other doctors

1640
00:55:23.828 --> 00:55:27.049
and other types of medical practitioners that

1641
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:28.990
might want to embrace this and take it on

1642
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:30.718
what are they going to have to deal with

1643
00:55:30.718 --> 00:55:32.254
if they take stem cells on?

1644
00:55:32.254 --> 00:55:33.982
<v ->What are they going to have to deal with?</v>

1645
00:55:33.982 --> 00:55:36.308
They're going to have to change the legislation.

1646
00:55:36.308 --> 00:55:40.617
I actually asked several lawyers questions

1647
00:55:40.617 --> 00:55:41.641
what do they do with that,

1648
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:43.540
because it's anti-trust for Obamacare,

1649
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.630
and they said "you're just going to have

1650
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:47.486
"to change the legislation."

1651
00:55:47.486 --> 00:55:49.577
<v Regina>Otherwise they're all going</v>

1652
00:55:49.577 --> 00:55:51.027
to be taken out the same way you were.

1653
00:55:51.027 --> 00:55:53.502
<v ->And the ones that are taken out</v>

1654
00:55:53.502 --> 00:55:54.803
are the ones that are effective.

1655
00:55:54.803 --> 00:55:56.446
There's a lot of ones that aren't effective.

1656
00:55:56.446 --> 00:55:58.387
Most alternative is not effective.

1657
00:55:58.387 --> 00:55:59.390
<v Regina>They'll leave them alone, yeah.</v>

1658
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:03.465
<v ->But like I said, one doctor said to me,</v>

1659
00:56:03.465 --> 00:56:04.894
"We don't care if your patient

1660
00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:05.790
"is getting better or worse,

1661
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:07.390
"we only care if you're doing the work

1662
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:08.670
"in a way scientifically."

1663
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.385
Basically, don't mess with them.

1664
00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:12.921
If you get the patient better,

1665
00:56:12.921 --> 00:56:14.350
in a way you don't know,

1666
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.768
they will get rid of you because it's competition.

1667
00:56:16.768 --> 00:56:18.112
<v Regina>That sounds very limiting</v>

1668
00:56:18.112 --> 00:56:19.626
for the future of stem cells.

1669
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:22.314
<v ->No, they'll pick up the stem cells.</v>

1670
00:56:22.314 --> 00:56:25.450
But they'll pick it up in their US glory fashion.

1671
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.306
Not the simple French fashion.

1672
00:56:27.306 --> 00:56:28.671
<v Regina>But youre doing the simple French fashion.</v>

1673
00:56:28.671 --> 00:56:30.655
And hopefully there are other people

1674
00:56:30.655 --> 00:56:32.895
that are popping up that are out there

1675
00:56:32.895 --> 00:56:34.623
doing it in a simple French fashion.

1676
00:56:34.623 --> 00:56:36.735
<v ->There probably are, they're staying quiet.</v>

1677
00:56:36.735 --> 00:56:39.018
Again, like a Jewish person in Nazi Germany.

1678
00:56:39.018 --> 00:56:40.511
<v Regina>Yeah, gotta be quiet about it.</v>

1679
00:56:40.511 --> 00:56:43.470
<v ->You can't go against the system.</v>

1680
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.091
The system is so controlled

1681
00:56:45.091 --> 00:56:47.082
and the way they control it is by insurance

1682
00:56:47.082 --> 00:56:48.639
by insurance codes.

1683
00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:49.492
And this is why we

1684
00:56:49.492 --> 00:56:51.178
do not give insurance codes.

1685
00:56:51.178 --> 00:56:53.012
My patients, I tell them straightforward

1686
00:56:53.012 --> 00:56:55.167
this is not insurance reimbursable,

1687
00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:57.023
you want to get an insurance reimbursement,

1688
00:56:57.023 --> 00:56:58.772
you can go to a doctor down the street.

1689
00:56:58.772 --> 00:56:59.732
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1690
00:56:59.732 --> 00:57:01.652
<v ->My business, you pay me for my services.</v>

1691
00:57:01.652 --> 00:57:02.740
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1692
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.364
<v ->Okay you pay me my services and that's simple.</v>

1693
00:57:05.364 --> 00:57:09.204
But insurance now, everyone gets it for free,

1694
00:57:09.204 --> 00:57:11.741
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

1695
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:12.744
<v ->That's what they're doing.</v>

1696
00:57:12.744 --> 00:57:14.194
<v Regina>As you're being put down the chute.</v>

1697
00:57:14.194 --> 00:57:18.120
<v ->It's anti competitive, and there's a team of lawyers</v>

1698
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.125
that we may go after them for anti trust.

1699
00:57:20.125 --> 00:57:22.280
Because it's illegal, what they're doing.

1700
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.029
<v Regina>So is this for real?</v>

1701
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:25.565
Might actually stir things up again?

1702
00:57:25.565 --> 00:57:26.653
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

1703
00:57:26.653 --> 00:57:28.658
I got nothing to lose.

1704
00:57:28.658 --> 00:57:30.706
And I do have the head of the National Health Federation

1705
00:57:30.706 --> 00:57:33.224
is an attorney, and he's looking to try to get

1706
00:57:33.224 --> 00:57:34.504
to see if we can get a team of lawyers

1707
00:57:34.504 --> 00:57:36.487
to pull a class action.

1708
00:57:36.487 --> 00:57:38.535
<v Regina>I know who you're talking about,</v>

1709
00:57:38.535 --> 00:57:39.453
good for you.

1710
00:57:39.453 --> 00:57:40.583
On that note, you keep stirring them up.

1711
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:43.271
Also I'm very happy you're getting results

1712
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:45.379
with this since we last talked,

1713
00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:47.214
with these porcine stem cells,

1714
00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.387
that's very exciting.

1715
00:57:48.387 --> 00:57:49.880
<v ->It's so exciting.</v>

1716
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.373
I can't wait for the next patient to come in.

1717
00:57:51.373 --> 00:57:53.293
Because I know they're going to walk out that door

1718
00:57:53.293 --> 00:57:55.405
<v Regina>Again, thank you so much Harvey.</v>

1719
00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.984
<v ->It's always a pleasure, Regina.</v>

1720
00:57:56.984 --> 00:57:59.139
It's always a pleasure, thanks a lot.

1721
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:03.171
<v ->To get further background on Harvey's work</v>

1722
00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:04.664
with dark field blood analysis

1723
00:58:04.664 --> 00:58:05.816
and lyme disease,

1724
00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:07.096
please feel free to watch

1725
00:58:07.096 --> 00:58:08.504
our other two interviews with him.

1726
00:58:08.504 --> 00:58:10.829
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1727
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:12.487
(ambient music)
