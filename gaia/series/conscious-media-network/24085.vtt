00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.477
<v ->Konstantin Korotkov is considered to be</v>

2
00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:05.357
among a handful of the premier physicists in Russia,

3
00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:07.906
a country that reveres its scientists.

4
00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:10.233
I considered it a genuine honor to have an hour

5
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.899
of his time so that he could bridge our understanding

6
00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.131
of the unseen world of energy with scientific principles.

7
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:19.683
As a professor of physics, Konstantin holds 12 patents

8
00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:23.117
on biophysics inventions, including that of his renowned

9
00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:26.530
bioelectrography device, which captures living

10
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.250
energy fields around people, plants, and water,

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.615
all living systems.

12
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:33.314
This device has allowed us to peak into the essence

13
00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:36.002
of the life force itself, including our food supply,

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.540
the water we drink, and the energy that occurs

15
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.179
when two or more gather.

16
00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:45.872 line:15% 
(gentle instrumental music)

17
00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:53.025
<v Regina>The word "energy" is now coming to the forefront.</v>

18
00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:55.040
You can even hear it on the evening news,

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.710
usually with some sort of derogatory statement

20
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.781
following it, because it's considered new age.

21
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:03.264
However, it's anything but.

22
00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.194
It's the building block of everything

23
00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:08.725
and you have done remarkable work in measuring

24
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.647
the energy output, so that we can really start

25
00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:14.922
making a crossover from the world of science

26
00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:18.122
into the world of energy, energy healing, and so forth.

27
00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:22.004
Can we start with some of the very common elements

28
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.887
of life around us, our air, our water, our food sources?

29
00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:28.766
I know you say Americans have horrible food

30
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.857
and you're absolutely right.

31
00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.779
Begin there or wherever you'd like with this.

32
00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:37.096
<v ->Okay, so you're absolutely right that now the word</v>

33
00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:42.096
"energy" is very, very popular, but to use any word,

34
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.509
first of all, we need to get definition.

35
00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.504
What do we mean by that?

36
00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:49.288
Because in a lot of metaphysical background

37
00:01:49.288 --> 00:01:53.938
environment, they use this word without any meaning

38
00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:55.869
and without understanding.

39
00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.556
When they use energy healing,

40
00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:00.679
"Sorry, what do you mean by that?"

41
00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.041
First of all, we need to make very clear definition.

42
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.921
I am a physicist with background in quantum physics.

43
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:11.366
I have spent many years in Soviet Union in this

44
00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:16.366
type of research, so for me, it is absolutely acceptable

45
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:21.211
to take normal physical definition of the word "energy."

46
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:24.432
We have many different types of energy.

47
00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:27.664
We have energy mechanical.

48
00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:28.731
We have chemical.

49
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.162
We have physical energy.

50
00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:34.533
We have potential energy, kinetic energy,

51
00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:38.991
and, in particular, in biology in our research.

52
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.991
We use energy that we define as energy of electrons.

53
00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.308
<v Regina>Of electrons, yes.</v>

54
00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:50.330
<v ->We can measure, in principle, and exactly define</v>

55
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.261
the energy of electrons and typically,

56
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.853
it's measured in electron volts.

57
00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:58.639
Then we can tell that we have electrons

58
00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.426
in the ground state in organic molecules,

59
00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.863
and we have excited electrons that have extra energy.

60
00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:10.254
This energy may be accepted by light.

61
00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:13.753
Of course, when we accept light, mostly sunlight,

62
00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:17.137
we increase the energy of our body.

63
00:03:17.137 --> 00:03:19.505
This means that we increase the energy

64
00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:22.332
of particular specific electrons.

65
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:25.350
This same way, we can increase energy

66
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.329
by electromagnetic impulses, by different fields,

67
00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.318
and these electrons may be transformed

68
00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.891
from one part of the body to another part of the body.

69
00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:40.656
When we tell about energy, energy circulation,

70
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:43.482
energy movement, energy mediums,

71
00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:48.482
we mean that we define this energy as electron transfer

72
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.061
along protein complexes in organic tissues

73
00:03:54.308 --> 00:03:58.234
and, in particular, in connective tissues.

74
00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:02.340
In Russia, we have a very strong line of biophysics,

75
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.710
and what's demonstrated and proven in biophysics,

76
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.827
is that electron transfer in complex organic molecules

77
00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:13.038
can come due to tunnel effect.

78
00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:14.105
<v Regina>Say that again?</v>

79
00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:18.115
<v ->Tunnel effects, so it's jumping off electrons from one</v>

80
00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:21.667
group of molecules to another group of molecules,

81
00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:25.549
because it was a big question, how it's possible.

82
00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:28.610
Of course, we have a lot of electron transfer

83
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.951
due to electrolysis, because in our connective tissues

84
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:36.044
we have always some water molecules,

85
00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.740
and these water molecules allows to

86
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.802
organize this electron transfer.

87
00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:43.361
This is, from our point of view,

88
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:47.905
is the basis of all this energy transfer, energy work.

89
00:04:47.905 --> 00:04:49.302
<v Regina>Which is what the energy work</v>

90
00:04:49.302 --> 00:04:51.436
of energy healers, Reiki and so forth?

91
00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:52.251
<v ->No, no, no.</v>

92
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:52.944
<v Regina>No?</v>

93
00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:54.362
<v ->Okay, let's not mix together everything.</v>

94
00:04:54.362 --> 00:04:55.962
<v Regina>Okay, so that's what i was asking.</v>

95
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.658
When we talk about the energy healers,

96
00:04:57.658 --> 00:05:00.672
are they actually affecting these exact

97
00:05:00.672 --> 00:05:04.006
portions of the, you say, through the water,

98
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:06.257
through the connective tissue and so forth?

99
00:05:06.257 --> 00:05:07.558
Is that what they're --

100
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:09.115
<v ->Yes, they do this through the water,</v>

101
00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:12.869
from our point of view, and when we tell that

102
00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:15.909
a person is full of energy or is lack of energy,

103
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.533
it means that there are electrons

104
00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.349
that are transported through mitochondria

105
00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.149
and then they are used to produce ETF, ADF,

106
00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:29.146
to really get energy to muscles

107
00:05:29.146 --> 00:05:31.777
and to different organism systems.

108
00:05:31.777 --> 00:05:36.777
We are based on normal biophysical

109
00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:41.273
concepts of energy stimulation in the body.

110
00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:45.656
This concept is underlied by electron transfer.

111
00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:49.165
From this point of view, then it's understandable

112
00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:53.603
if we have some device, or human influence,

113
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:57.826
or the influence of some particular food or water.

114
00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:02.125
This is designed only to provide those electrons

115
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:04.098
to different parts of the body.

116
00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:08.898
Our brain, our mental concentration would allow us

117
00:06:08.898 --> 00:06:12.204
to redistribute those electrons

118
00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:15.127
from one part of the body to another part of the body.

119
00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:20.127
In oriental practice, it is known as energy movement

120
00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:24.779
along chakras, along meridians, along kundalini,

121
00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.714
and it's really effective because it's measurable.

122
00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Regina>Right.</v>

123
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.708
<v ->We can measure the output of photons or electrons</v>

124
00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:35.350
in different parts of the body.

125
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.068
We can measure temperature in different

126
00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:39.692
parts of the body, and this allows us to see

127
00:06:39.692 --> 00:06:41.921
this transfer of energy.

128
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:43.553
<v Regina>They have actually been, even,</v>

129
00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.294
the images of this have been captured

130
00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:49.216
using radioactive isotopes along meridians,

131
00:06:49.216 --> 00:06:52.512
acupuncture meridians, by Jean-Claude Darras years ago.

132
00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:55.605
We can see that there is a movement of something

133
00:06:55.605 --> 00:06:59.018
beyond what is clinically definable.

134
00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.248
<v ->No, but it is clinically definable,</v>

135
00:07:01.248 --> 00:07:05.866
but the problem is that no one was able to define meridians.

136
00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:06.933
<v Regina>Meridians, exactly.</v>

137
00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:08.822
<v ->Because they don't exist.</v>

138
00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:12.845
We don't need some mythological paths,

139
00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:16.279
because it's transfer of electrons.

140
00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:19.649
Transfer of energy uses electron transfer

141
00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.964
through the connective tissues,

142
00:07:21.964 --> 00:07:26.081
through the bone marrow, so it may be done in any part.

143
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:29.601
There seems to be some specific areas where

144
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:33.302
it is more likely to have this transfer,

145
00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:36.502
but it depends on condition.

146
00:07:36.502 --> 00:07:40.704
Any doctor, acupuncture doctor, knows that some points

147
00:07:40.704 --> 00:07:44.789
may be active, some may be absolutely slow.

148
00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:49.109
Some give big resistance, some give very low resistance.

149
00:07:49.109 --> 00:07:51.989
It totally depends on the condition of the person

150
00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:55.615
and time cycle of a person.

151
00:07:55.615 --> 00:07:58.890
Because it change with time, it has its own cycles.

152
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.481
<v Regina>The human body, the human being,</v>

153
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.060
having its own cycles.

154
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.081
We breathe, we sleep, we eat, we drink water,

155
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:09.886
and basically, we're living in a world,

156
00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:12.937
certainly in the western world, in the United States

157
00:08:12.937 --> 00:08:15.742
to a very good extent, that is denuded of any kind

158
00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:20.062
of really vital energy source, starting with our food.

159
00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:22.963
The vitality, and you have actually taken it upon yourself,

160
00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:24.840
you've done a tremendous amount of travel,

161
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.882
to be able to measure the output, the electron,

162
00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:31.037
I guess it's the electron output

163
00:08:31.037 --> 00:08:32.648
of all of these substances.

164
00:08:32.648 --> 00:08:35.175
What have you found in the modern,

165
00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:37.938
the way in which we're living in the modern world?

166
00:08:37.938 --> 00:08:42.012
<v ->We are measuring the output of electrons and photons</v>

167
00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:44.935
stimulated by electromagnetic field.

168
00:08:44.935 --> 00:08:48.145
It is quantum process, that's why we can measure it

169
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:51.046
at any subject, whether it be living being,

170
00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:55.174
whether it be water, some cosmetic product,

171
00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:58.054
leaf, plant, or stone.

172
00:08:58.054 --> 00:09:01.147
The only difference that for human being,

173
00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:04.187
it is some changeable process.

174
00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:06.437
It is repeatable, very quite stable,

175
00:09:06.437 --> 00:09:09.435
but it has some line of variation.

176
00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:12.570
We have much stronger energy in daytime,

177
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.216
then it comes down, then again it increases,

178
00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:17.050
then it comes down again.

179
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.351
We have a cycle.

180
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:19.717
We have a day cycle.

181
00:09:19.717 --> 00:09:21.924
We have a month cycle.

182
00:09:21.924 --> 00:09:23.663
We have a cycle during the year,

183
00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:28.079
and we have the main, in our life, 11-year cycle.

184
00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:30.308
When we are measuring food, again,

185
00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:33.785
we are measuring this output of electrons and photons.

186
00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:37.017
We have database of situations when we are measuring

187
00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:41.454
good food, organically grown, conventionally grown,

188
00:09:41.454 --> 00:09:43.608
and chemically grown.

189
00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:46.307
Of course, it's tremendous difference.

190
00:09:46.307 --> 00:09:49.603
<v Regina>This difference has an impact</v>

191
00:09:49.603 --> 00:09:52.344
on our overall health, the quality of our lives,

192
00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:54.125
our energy levels.

193
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:59.125
<v ->Yes, it has very clear effect on our health state.</v>

194
00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.510
It was study done by different groups

195
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.068
using different instrumentations, including ours,

196
00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:09.400
that demonstrated that people who drink good water,

197
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.698
and by good water, we mean, first of all, natural water,

198
00:10:13.698 --> 00:10:16.503
water from natural springs,

199
00:10:16.503 --> 00:10:20.919
water that have a low level of contaminations,

200
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:24.513
that have appropriate level of different minerals

201
00:10:24.513 --> 00:10:26.583
and substances.

202
00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:30.614
People having good food, again, natural food,

203
00:10:30.614 --> 00:10:33.057
they have much higher health quality

204
00:10:33.057 --> 00:10:36.001
compared with people who use conventional food

205
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:37.762
or just artificial water.

206
00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.799
<v Regina>When you come to America, and you do these</v>

207
00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:42.263
kinds of events where you have to be in a city

208
00:10:42.263 --> 00:10:44.439
for a few days at a time, what do you notice

209
00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.394
the primary difference between food from your garden

210
00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:50.828
in Russia compared to here?

211
00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:52.364
<v ->Not only my garden.</v>

212
00:10:52.364 --> 00:10:54.081
In Russia, we have very good food

213
00:10:54.081 --> 00:10:56.428
and very good tradition of food.

214
00:10:56.428 --> 00:10:59.446
People really care preparing food.

215
00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:01.675
In United States, it's fantastic country.

216
00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:04.779
It's a great country, and this country was great

217
00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:07.104
in developing different technologies.

218
00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:10.795
It was first technology in car-making,

219
00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:15.795
technology in electronics, and technology in aviation,

220
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.602
so every technology was designed to the best

221
00:11:18.602 --> 00:11:20.714
and the highest level.

222
00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:23.338
Same was done in food production.

223
00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:25.866
It was designed as technology,

224
00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:28.351
and it was huge factories, and it is huge factories

225
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:33.343
producing meat, chicken, vegetables, foods.

226
00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:37.982
It's designed like factories with very high effectiveness.

227
00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:40.937
It was interesting idea, but then it was found

228
00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:43.114
that this idea work for people.

229
00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:44.202
<v Regina>No.</v>

230
00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:46.922
<v ->Because, first of all, in this production,</v>

231
00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:49.663
it's necessary to use a lot of chemicals

232
00:11:49.663 --> 00:11:53.631
because to keep, for example, a thousand of chicken

233
00:11:53.631 --> 00:11:57.097
together in one little place, relatively little,

234
00:11:57.097 --> 00:12:00.393
you need to use antibiotics, you need to use

235
00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:04.126
a lot of different chemicals, medications,

236
00:12:04.126 --> 00:12:09.126
and, of course, a lot of drugs to let them grow.

237
00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:11.519
<v Regina>Hormones.</v>

238
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:12.678
<v ->Hormones, absolutely.</v>

239
00:12:12.678 --> 00:12:15.057
Then it all comes to people,

240
00:12:15.057 --> 00:12:18.182
and it all is kept in people's body.

241
00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:19.974
<v Regina>I think this is one thing that is</v>

242
00:12:19.974 --> 00:12:21.713
just becoming better understood now,

243
00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:25.200
which is the passed on effect of these antibiotics,

244
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.243
and also the hormones are changing the maturation rate

245
00:12:29.243 --> 00:12:31.333
of the people in this country.

246
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:32.368
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

247
00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:33.904
<v Regina>It's been bumped up, what, a year and a half,</v>

248
00:12:33.904 --> 00:12:35.996
two years, the rate of maturity

249
00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:38.792
because of these effects, right?

250
00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:41.106
Aside from the fact that 25% of all antibiotics

251
00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:43.478
don't even work anymore.

252
00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:44.619
<v ->Sure.</v>

253
00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:45.803
<v Regina>Not good.</v>

254
00:12:45.803 --> 00:12:48.192
<v ->Actually, it's a very bad station because</v>

255
00:12:48.192 --> 00:12:50.677
we need antibiotics in our life.

256
00:12:50.677 --> 00:12:53.301
We need it, and it was fantastic achievement

257
00:12:53.301 --> 00:12:55.829
of humankind to develop antibiotics,

258
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:58.688
but when they are used on every step,

259
00:12:58.688 --> 00:13:01.983
of course, they lose their effectiveness.

260
00:13:01.983 --> 00:13:05.119
We have a lot more and more microcultures

261
00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:07.466
that are resistant to antibiotics,

262
00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:11.135
so they need to develop more and more stronger antibiotics.

263
00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:15.753
Of course, any antibiotic has tremendous side effects.

264
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:18.676
They tremendously destroy all microflora

265
00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:21.417
in our stomach, in our colons,

266
00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:24.254
and people have to restore it later on.

267
00:13:24.254 --> 00:13:25.673
<v Regina>This is a big problem.</v>

268
00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:27.081
<v ->It's tremendous problem.</v>

269
00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:28.456
<v Regina>Well, and passed on,</v>

270
00:13:28.456 --> 00:13:30.387
even drugs such as Prozac.

271
00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:31.262
<v ->Of course, it has --</v>

272
00:13:31.262 --> 00:13:33.704
<v Regina>I mean, in the water supplies,</v>

273
00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:37.512
city municipal water supplies, there are still

274
00:13:37.512 --> 00:13:40.413
signatures from that drug in the drinking water

275
00:13:40.413 --> 00:13:42.205
that are not purified out.

276
00:13:42.205 --> 00:13:43.293
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

277
00:13:43.293 --> 00:13:47.230
It is really tremendous problem of using medications

278
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.986
when they are not really necessary,

279
00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:54.037
without any understanding what would be

280
00:13:54.037 --> 00:13:56.885
the long range effects,

281
00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:58.932
mostly for children.

282
00:13:58.932 --> 00:14:00.074
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

283
00:14:00.074 --> 00:14:01.834
<v ->Because children, they grow up.</v>

284
00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:04.063
Their organisms are very subtle,

285
00:14:04.063 --> 00:14:07.220
and when they use medications to control their growth,

286
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.025
to control their behavior, it is dreadful.

287
00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:11.124
It's a crime.

288
00:14:11.124 --> 00:14:12.073
<v Regina>It is a crime.</v>

289
00:14:12.073 --> 00:14:13.769
I couldn't agree with you more,

290
00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:18.769
and the lack of education because this is the way,

291
00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:21.544
this is how we are educated, that these foods,

292
00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:26.237
mass culture of these factory foods

293
00:14:26.237 --> 00:14:27.933
are the culture.

294
00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:31.069
It's counter-culture to find sources that are,

295
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:32.317
again, until now.

296
00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:34.034
Now it's becoming more popular.

297
00:14:34.034 --> 00:14:35.783
Some movie stars have gotten on board.

298
00:14:35.783 --> 00:14:38.269
It kind of takes a movie star to make something popular.

299
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:42.076
<v ->Yes, and you see the example of United States.</v>

300
00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:45.810
Really it is a bad example for all the world,

301
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.732
because it's the most rich country in the world.

302
00:14:48.732 --> 00:14:50.823
It's most developed country in the world,

303
00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:54.033
a country where you can find everything if you want.

304
00:14:54.033 --> 00:14:56.023
But the country where the health of the population

305
00:14:56.023 --> 00:14:57.186
is quite bad.

306
00:14:57.186 --> 00:14:59.729
<v Regina>Oh, we're starving to death for real nutrients.</v>

307
00:14:59.729 --> 00:15:00.423
<v ->Yes.</v>

308
00:15:00.423 --> 00:15:01.283
<v Regina>As we get fatter and fatter,</v>

309
00:15:01.283 --> 00:15:02.659
we are starving to death.

310
00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:03.843
<v ->Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

311
00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:05.187
<v Regina>This goes with our,</v>

312
00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:06.904
I'd like to go back to water for just a moment.

313
00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:09.016
You were talking about natural spring water,

314
00:15:09.016 --> 00:15:11.682
which, of course, a very small percentage

315
00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.687
of the population would actually have access to,

316
00:15:13.687 --> 00:15:17.143
but what about some of the technologies.

317
00:15:17.143 --> 00:15:19.020
Patrick Flanagan's work and others,

318
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.274
where they use elements, megahydrate and such,

319
00:15:22.274 --> 00:15:24.066
that structures water.

320
00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:26.273
Are these beneficial if you're trying to restore

321
00:15:26.273 --> 00:15:27.756
some energy to the water?

322
00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:28.966
<v ->Tremendously beneficial.</v>

323
00:15:28.966 --> 00:15:30.011
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

324
00:15:30.011 --> 00:15:32.165
<v ->Of course, you're correct that to use</v>

325
00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.768
spring natural water, it's difficult,

326
00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.050
but anyway, you can find it in stores.

327
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.810
You can find on one shelf.

328
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.109
It will be, "Good water prepared with good minerals."

329
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:46.405
Understand that it is distilled and then

330
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:48.026
some minerals added.

331
00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:49.626
It is absolutely dead water.

332
00:15:49.626 --> 00:15:52.900
Then you can find, practically same price,

333
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.716
water from natural springs.

334
00:15:55.716 --> 00:15:58.318
<v Regina>I've heard you also mention the fact that</v>

335
00:15:58.318 --> 00:16:02.212
water, the movement of water, is what helps

336
00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.675
structure water, so in some cultures,

337
00:16:04.675 --> 00:16:07.854
they actually observe a practice of pouring.

338
00:16:07.854 --> 00:16:09.016
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

339
00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:10.616
<v Regina>The pouring of the water before drinking</v>

340
00:16:10.616 --> 00:16:11.800
is very important.

341
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.147
Can you talk about that from a scientific viewpoint?

342
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:16.429
These are not just old wive's tales.

343
00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:21.429
<v ->Yes, so when we apply a strong movement to water,</v>

344
00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:24.503
we dissolve water molecules.

345
00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:27.202
They create active radicals.

346
00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:32.202
Those radicals exist for billionths fraction of a second,

347
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.812
but it's enough to combine a different structure in water.

348
00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:40.204
Most of the structure comes due to some minerals

349
00:16:40.204 --> 00:16:43.873
that are kept in water, because practically pure water

350
00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:45.078
doesn't exist at all.

351
00:16:45.078 --> 00:16:46.699
It's just mathematical model.

352
00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:49.046
We always have some impurities in water,

353
00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:50.369
but it's normal.

354
00:16:50.369 --> 00:16:55.369
Then they create clusters around this atoms and molecules.

355
00:16:56.032 --> 00:17:00.118
These clusters, they have a structure of a particular

356
00:17:00.118 --> 00:17:02.464
mineral or particular crystal,

357
00:17:02.464 --> 00:17:05.674
so they make water crystallized.

358
00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:09.130
After this, water is much more structured.

359
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:09.783
It has not --

360
00:17:09.783 --> 00:17:11.713
<v Regina>Why is it important to have structured water?</v>

361
00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:15.340
<v ->Because our blood, it is a structured liquid.</v>

362
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.305
Our inner liquids in our stomach,

363
00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:20.833
it's all structured liquids.

364
00:17:20.833 --> 00:17:23.926
It's very easy to show.

365
00:17:23.926 --> 00:17:28.149
Please put a drop of blood on the glass and you will see,

366
00:17:28.149 --> 00:17:32.449
in several seconds, it will be structured.

367
00:17:32.449 --> 00:17:35.563
Even if diluted, you will see some structure.

368
00:17:35.563 --> 00:17:37.142
<v Regina>Now, distilled water, though.</v>

369
00:17:37.142 --> 00:17:39.552
You take water and you distill it, no structure?

370
00:17:39.552 --> 00:17:40.950
<v ->No structure, absolutely,</v>

371
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.528
because it is absolutely chaotic process.

372
00:17:45.528 --> 00:17:49.848
Devices that structure water, they are very useful,

373
00:17:49.848 --> 00:17:52.824
but we need to take into account two topics.

374
00:17:52.824 --> 00:17:56.066
First of all, water should be pure.

375
00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:59.118
It shouldn't contain negative contaminations.

376
00:17:59.118 --> 00:18:00.622
<v Regina>Arsenic, chlorine.</v>

377
00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:05.622
<v ->Arsenic, chlorine, then iron, then mercury.</v>

378
00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:11.426
A lot waters from commercial sources,

379
00:18:11.426 --> 00:18:13.048
they have these impurities.

380
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:15.556
What is recommended, because it's due to pipes.

381
00:18:15.556 --> 00:18:18.159
We have so many pipes and it's understandable.

382
00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:20.623
What is the first step should be?

383
00:18:20.623 --> 00:18:23.406
To use normal filters.

384
00:18:23.406 --> 00:18:24.345
<v Regina>Normal filters?</v>

385
00:18:24.345 --> 00:18:25.988
<v ->Yes, normal filtering system.</v>

386
00:18:25.988 --> 00:18:27.839
Typically, it's several stage of filtering.

387
00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:28.445
<v Regina>Right.</v>

388
00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:30.525
Reverse osmosis, is that okay?

389
00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:32.243
<v ->We don't need reverse osmosis.</v>

390
00:18:32.243 --> 00:18:34.131
We need just normal filtering.

391
00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:35.453
<v Regina>You mean like charcoal</v>

392
00:18:35.453 --> 00:18:36.893
or what do you mean by normal?

393
00:18:36.893 --> 00:18:39.282
<v ->Typically, it comes, the first stage comes,</v>

394
00:18:39.282 --> 00:18:40.669
in paper filter.

395
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:43.975
It filters out main impurities, big impurities.

396
00:18:43.975 --> 00:18:47.454
Then it is coal filter, then it's microfiber filter.

397
00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:48.244
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

398
00:18:48.244 --> 00:18:50.099
<v ->We don't need reverse osmosis,</v>

399
00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:52.627
because it change the structure.

400
00:18:52.627 --> 00:18:54.600
Filtering, it keeps the structure

401
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.277
and coal, it makes it even more structured.

402
00:18:57.277 --> 00:19:00.615
Then, it makes sense to use some energizing device

403
00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:03.497
that makes a structured water, like Flanagan's,

404
00:19:03.497 --> 00:19:06.558
like Gia water, like something --

405
00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:09.342
Now-a-day era, there are a lot of devices

406
00:19:09.342 --> 00:19:11.550
of this kind available.

407
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.713
Of course, they should be tested,

408
00:19:12.713 --> 00:19:14.782
but some of them are very effective.

409
00:19:14.782 --> 00:19:17.310
Then you have really good water,

410
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.862
even from tap source in any city.

411
00:19:20.862 --> 00:19:22.355
<v Regina>Right, and this is really</v>

412
00:19:22.355 --> 00:19:25.853
a foundational key to energizing our bodies again.

413
00:19:25.853 --> 00:19:30.152
<v ->Yes, this is a key principle, and key element.</v>

414
00:19:30.152 --> 00:19:32.242
<v Regina>Okay, so we've talked about food.</v>

415
00:19:32.242 --> 00:19:34.119
You don't want food that's basically grown

416
00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:36.487
factory-style and dead.

417
00:19:36.487 --> 00:19:38.204
You want organic food, grown from land

418
00:19:38.204 --> 00:19:40.882
that's been treated properly and vitalized.

419
00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:44.081
<v ->Yes, of course, but the first thing, what I do</v>

420
00:19:44.081 --> 00:19:47.890
coming to any market or any store,

421
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.841
I just smell the food.

422
00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:51.025
<v Regina>You smell it, yes.</v>

423
00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:51.608
<v ->Yes.</v>

424
00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:52.770
<v Regina>Most of it has no smell</v>

425
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.392
in the grocery store, in the supermarket.

426
00:19:54.392 --> 00:19:56.738
<v ->Yes, if it is no smell, then it is synthetic.</v>

427
00:19:56.738 --> 00:20:01.357
If it has some smell, then it has something to the earth.

428
00:20:01.357 --> 00:20:04.162
It may be not even organically grown,

429
00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:06.167
it may have some fertilizers, but anyway,

430
00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:08.599
if it has smell, that means it has something

431
00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:09.795
from the earth.

432
00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:11.139
<v Regina>Some kind of life force.</v>

433
00:20:11.139 --> 00:20:12.856
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

434
00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:14.318
<v Regina>Okay, well that's a good one.</v>

435
00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.779
<v ->Then it is good for our health.</v>

436
00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:18.179
<v Regina>What about genetically modified organisms?</v>

437
00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:22.360
<v ->We have a lot of study now in Australia, in Russia,</v>

438
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.421
that demonstrate that GM food are really

439
00:20:25.421 --> 00:20:27.789
dramatic for animals.

440
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:29.463
<v Regina>The changes in the animals,</v>

441
00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:30.903
by eating them you mean?

442
00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:34.316
<v ->It was experiment then they feed rats</v>

443
00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:36.387
and rabbits with GM food.

444
00:20:36.387 --> 00:20:37.219
<v Regina>What happened?</v>

445
00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:39.384
<v ->In second, third generations, they have a lot of</v>

446
00:20:39.384 --> 00:20:43.096
deformed offsprings, a lot.

447
00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:44.376
<v Regina>Second and third generations,</v>

448
00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.880
that's not that far out.

449
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.709
It's actually making changes in the DNA?

450
00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:51.501
<v ->It makes changes in DNA, absolutely,</v>

451
00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.802
in DNA structure.

452
00:20:52.802 --> 00:20:57.421
It was study done very precisely, very carefully.

453
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:02.540
The principle is, we don't know exactly

454
00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.188
what would be the long range outcome of this GM food,

455
00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:10.135
because it is artificial mixture of different genes.

456
00:21:11.224 --> 00:21:16.173
Genes that may be really damaging for the body.

457
00:21:16.173 --> 00:21:20.216
The main principle is, we can consume

458
00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:24.482
anything in little quantities, will be even poison,

459
00:21:24.482 --> 00:21:25.922
in principle, you can recover.

460
00:21:25.922 --> 00:21:26.711
<v Regina>We are.</v>

461
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:27.778
Arsenic, it's in the water.

462
00:21:27.778 --> 00:21:29.079
<v ->Yes, in principle.</v>

463
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:34.079
But our liver, it keeps these traces of different

464
00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:38.764
negative influences, and it keeps for the time being,

465
00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:43.764
and at some moment, it comes to some level

466
00:21:43.947 --> 00:21:46.934
when we feel it and our system reacts to this.

467
00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:47.915
<v Regina>Right.</v>

468
00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:50.742
Well, it's interesting, they've done these studies.

469
00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:52.416
What has the net effect been?

470
00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:54.720
Did you say Austria or Switzerland, where these studies --

471
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.669
<v ->Australia.</v>

472
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:56.971
<v Regina>Australia, okay.</v>

473
00:21:56.971 --> 00:21:58.382
<v ->Australia and in Russia.</v>

474
00:21:58.382 --> 00:21:59.289
<v Regina>And in Russia.</v>

475
00:21:59.289 --> 00:22:02.499
<v ->Some studies in Switzerland as well, I know of.</v>

476
00:22:02.499 --> 00:22:06.448
<v Regina>Are GMO, are they banned in those countries</v>

477
00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:07.493
as a result of that?

478
00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.063
<v ->In Russia, it is banned.</v>

479
00:22:09.063 --> 00:22:11.773
In European community, it is banned.

480
00:22:11.773 --> 00:22:13.266
I don't know about Australia.

481
00:22:13.266 --> 00:22:15.282
<v Regina>Okay, interesting.</v>

482
00:22:15.282 --> 00:22:17.724
We're quite a bit behind here in the U.S. on that.

483
00:22:17.724 --> 00:22:18.413
<v ->Yeah.</v>

484
00:22:18.413 --> 00:22:20.781
<v Regina>Still trying to argue the point publicly,</v>

485
00:22:20.781 --> 00:22:23.396
for public opinion, that they are safe and okay.

486
00:22:23.396 --> 00:22:24.676
We're still there.

487
00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.052
<v ->Yeah, because it's big money, we all understand.</v>

488
00:22:26.052 --> 00:22:27.417
Because it's tremendous money.

489
00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:28.324
<v Regina>Tremendous money.</v>

490
00:22:28.324 --> 00:22:31.854
<v ->Yeah, because this GM food, farmers can't</v>

491
00:22:31.854 --> 00:22:36.793
keep this GM grains for next harvest.

492
00:22:36.793 --> 00:22:38.192
They need to buy it.

493
00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:39.376
<v Regina>Yes, Monsanto.</v>

494
00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:42.000
<v ->Absolutely, so it's tremendous money for the industry.</v>

495
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.208
<v Regina>Well, as a naive reporter about,</v>

496
00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:47.561
oh maybe 15, 17, 18 years ago,

497
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:50.387
I actually was invited to do a story

498
00:22:50.387 --> 00:22:54.867
on the flavor savor tomato at the university,

499
00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:58.440
not understanding any of this, except there was a fish gene

500
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.186
that was inserted into the genetic complex

501
00:23:03.186 --> 00:23:05.618
so that it wouldn't rot as fast.

502
00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:07.314
It wasn't for years that I understood

503
00:23:07.314 --> 00:23:09.543
exactly what I had seen and what was going on.

504
00:23:09.543 --> 00:23:13.255
I had no idea of the complexities of what was to come.

505
00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:15.420
You get people in the media on board

506
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.023
telling these stories, and for the last 15 years,

507
00:23:18.023 --> 00:23:20.849
people have been eating genetically modified tomatoes.

508
00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:23.217
I hope not because I didn't know any better

509
00:23:23.217 --> 00:23:27.517
as a reporter, than to say, "No, run for your life!"

510
00:23:27.517 --> 00:23:29.213
<v ->Because the question is, what will be</v>

511
00:23:29.213 --> 00:23:30.567
in the next generation?

512
00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:33.095
<v Regina>Exactly, because when you're talking about rats,</v>

513
00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:34.972
of course, you're seeing the DNA changes

514
00:23:34.972 --> 00:23:39.154
and very quick generational changes.

515
00:23:39.154 --> 00:23:40.323
In humans, I don't want to wait to see

516
00:23:40.323 --> 00:23:41.411
what's going to happen.

517
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:43.757
I think they certainly should be banned.

518
00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:46.264
This brings us also, we've talked about that,

519
00:23:46.264 --> 00:23:48.237
we haven't talked too much about the air we breathe

520
00:23:48.237 --> 00:23:50.562
and the vitality, and energetic imprint of the air.

521
00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.557
You're really big on negative ions.

522
00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:53.858
<v ->Mm-hmm, sure.</v>

523
00:23:53.858 --> 00:23:54.786
<v Regina>Can you talk about that</v>

524
00:23:54.786 --> 00:23:56.581
and how we can infuse those in

525
00:23:56.581 --> 00:23:57.989
where they naturally are not?

526
00:23:57.989 --> 00:24:00.848
<v ->It was big study done, first of all,</v>

527
00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:05.848
by our Russian scientist Chizhevsky in '40s and '50s,

528
00:24:06.135 --> 00:24:08.919
where it was demonstrated that air,

529
00:24:08.919 --> 00:24:12.108
having no negative ions, has very dramatic

530
00:24:12.108 --> 00:24:14.423
effect to life.

531
00:24:14.423 --> 00:24:17.100
Experiment was very precisely done.

532
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.876
It was two sealed cages of rats,

533
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:25.867
and in one cage, it was air where all ions

534
00:24:25.867 --> 00:24:27.937
was filtered out.

535
00:24:27.937 --> 00:24:31.542
In the other cage was air with increased quantity

536
00:24:31.542 --> 00:24:33.024
of negative ions.

537
00:24:33.024 --> 00:24:36.416
It was demonstrated that in the cage with negative ions,

538
00:24:36.416 --> 00:24:40.938
longevity was three times bigger than in the other cage.

539
00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:41.984
<v Regina>Well, that's substantial.</v>

540
00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:43.168
Three times the lifespan.

541
00:24:43.168 --> 00:24:44.266
<v ->Yes, three times.</v>

542
00:24:44.266 --> 00:24:46.815
It is really tremendous effect, 300%.

543
00:24:46.815 --> 00:24:51.370
<v Regina>In Russia, I heard in your lecture,</v>

544
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.612
that it's required to have negative ion generators

545
00:24:54.612 --> 00:24:57.705
in, what, hospitals, in clinics of certain types?

546
00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:59.007
This is good thinking.

547
00:24:59.007 --> 00:25:00.233
<v ->It's not required.</v>

548
00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:01.257
<v Regina>It's just done?</v>

549
00:25:01.257 --> 00:25:02.974
<v ->It's not regulation to have it,</v>

550
00:25:02.974 --> 00:25:05.204
but most of things, they do have it.

551
00:25:05.204 --> 00:25:05.972
<v Regina>They do.</v>

552
00:25:05.972 --> 00:25:07.529
It's not a requirement, this is voluntary.

553
00:25:07.529 --> 00:25:08.318
<v ->Yes.</v>

554
00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:11.518
It's not voluntary, because it is up to the doctors

555
00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:13.651
whether they have it or haven't,

556
00:25:13.651 --> 00:25:15.795
because they have some fundings,

557
00:25:15.795 --> 00:25:17.064
they have some resources.

558
00:25:17.064 --> 00:25:21.416
It's quite popular because it's very well-known in Russia.

559
00:25:21.416 --> 00:25:24.146
<v Regina>How can we, besides the negative ion generators,</v>

560
00:25:24.146 --> 00:25:25.661
what are some of the other ways in which

561
00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:30.557
we can infuse more negative ions into

562
00:25:30.557 --> 00:25:33.063
our own atmospheres in our homes, for example?

563
00:25:33.063 --> 00:25:37.106
<v ->First of all, those negative ions should be connected</v>

564
00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:38.641
with water vapors.

565
00:25:38.641 --> 00:25:39.825
<v Regina>Water vapors, okay.</v>

566
00:25:39.825 --> 00:25:44.369
<v ->We should some appropriate content of water vapors,</v>

567
00:25:44.369 --> 00:25:47.206
of humidity in the air, and then,

568
00:25:47.206 --> 00:25:52.206
the best if it is negative charged water vapors.

569
00:25:52.571 --> 00:25:56.636
In Russia and in Europe now, we have special generators,

570
00:25:56.636 --> 00:25:59.835
electron generators that produce water vapors

571
00:25:59.835 --> 00:26:02.203
enriched with negative ions.

572
00:26:02.203 --> 00:26:05.394
It is, in Europe and in Russia, it's quite available.

573
00:26:05.394 --> 00:26:08.113
I don't know about how it is in United States.

574
00:26:08.113 --> 00:26:10.686
But as it is coming fast, then I am absolutely sure.

575
00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:11.849
<v Regina>It's not common, but you can</v>

576
00:26:11.849 --> 00:26:14.515
find them if you wish, yes.

577
00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:18.301
<v ->It's very good because it's very easy to check.</v>

578
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:21.181
You just need to install it in your bedroom

579
00:26:21.181 --> 00:26:24.968
and you will find that you sleep much better and less time.

580
00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:27.080
<v Regina>What does it do to the immune system as well?</v>

581
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.237
<v ->Of course, because it's very good support</v>

582
00:26:30.237 --> 00:26:32.029
to immune system.

583
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:33.949
<v Regina>As that study of the three times</v>

584
00:26:33.949 --> 00:26:36.658
of longevity would indicate, same thing for humans.

585
00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:37.874
<v ->Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.</v>

586
00:26:37.874 --> 00:26:39.239
<v Regina>There's every reason to do this,</v>

587
00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:41.095
especially, you say, as we sleep in particular.

588
00:26:41.095 --> 00:26:41.937
<v ->Yes.</v>

589
00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:43.281
<v Regina>What about in the workplace?</v>

590
00:26:43.281 --> 00:26:45.692
<v ->In Russia, again, it's very typical</v>

591
00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:48.571
to have these negative ions in workplace, in offices,

592
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:51.058
because, I give you a very funny example.

593
00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:53.329
I had a friend of mine who was a big business man.

594
00:26:53.329 --> 00:26:54.704
He's smoker.

595
00:26:54.704 --> 00:26:56.304
He smokes a lot.

596
00:26:56.304 --> 00:26:59.696
When you enter to his business office,

597
00:26:59.696 --> 00:27:04.219
you feel the beautiful air of pine trees.

598
00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:06.960
No smoke at all.

599
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.375
He's smoking, but he has negative ion generator

600
00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:15.099
that is specially designed to prevent the smoke

601
00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:17.446
coming from him to other places.

602
00:27:17.446 --> 00:27:19.696
<v Regina>Oh, I can see the practical application here.</v>

603
00:27:19.696 --> 00:27:21.467
Somebody who doesn't want their wife to know

604
00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:22.928
they're still smoking. (laughs)

605
00:27:22.928 --> 00:27:24.112
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

606
00:27:24.112 --> 00:27:25.690
It's a very good application.

607
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.714
<v Regina>That's wonderful.</v>

608
00:27:26.714 --> 00:27:28.709
<v ->You know that this smoke is very dangerous</v>

609
00:27:28.709 --> 00:27:32.198
for non-smoking people, by being nearby.

610
00:27:32.198 --> 00:27:33.244
<v ->Yes, secondhand.</v>

611
00:27:33.244 --> 00:27:35.238
There's a lot of awareness of that in the United States.

612
00:27:35.238 --> 00:27:39.259
<v ->It's absolutely sure that it's really damaging effect.</v>

613
00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:42.640
But with this negative ion generator, it's absolutely safe.

614
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.592
<v Regina>You just mentioned pine trees a moment ago.</v>

615
00:27:44.592 --> 00:27:45.552
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

616
00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:47.953
<v Regina>The notion that where you have forests</v>

617
00:27:47.953 --> 00:27:51.078
that have been denuded and ruined, like in Palestine,

618
00:27:51.078 --> 00:27:53.564
where all of the foliage has now been removed

619
00:27:53.564 --> 00:27:54.566
and is gone.

620
00:27:54.566 --> 00:27:58.470
What effect does that have on the health of the people?

621
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.552
<v ->Of course, it is absolutely dramatic effect</v>

622
00:28:01.552 --> 00:28:05.339
because the area where it was pine trees,

623
00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:08.965
it was big forests, now they are totally devastated.

624
00:28:08.965 --> 00:28:11.792
Of course, people are living in desert.

625
00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:14.038
They live in very bad condition,

626
00:28:14.038 --> 00:28:16.086
and if you look to the health state

627
00:28:16.086 --> 00:28:18.497
of people living in those countries,

628
00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:20.843
of course it's quite low.

629
00:28:20.843 --> 00:28:22.102
They have a lot of problems.

630
00:28:22.102 --> 00:28:24.672
They have a lot of diseases, skin diseases,

631
00:28:24.672 --> 00:28:29.672
bronchial diseases, because they have very bad air.

632
00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:32.715
<v Regina>The vitality of the pine tree itself,</v>

633
00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:36.896
also, does it create a negative ion atmosphere?

634
00:28:36.896 --> 00:28:39.563
Or what does the pine tree itself do?

635
00:28:39.563 --> 00:28:40.886
I'm using pine specifically because

636
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.613
I heard you mention them.

637
00:28:42.613 --> 00:28:46.528
<v ->They, as any tree, they produce oxygen</v>

638
00:28:46.528 --> 00:28:50.230
and this is charged oxygen, so it's active oxygen.

639
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:54.453
Pine trees, they specifically produce much more

640
00:28:54.453 --> 00:28:57.119
active oxygen compared to other plants

641
00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:58.698
and other vegetations.

642
00:28:58.698 --> 00:29:01.184
<v Regina>I think I might be backing into it at this point,</v>

643
00:29:01.184 --> 00:29:03.551
but you talk about eco-genetics.

644
00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:07.572
Now, what does that mean and what are its implications?

645
00:29:07.572 --> 00:29:12.572
<v ->It means that now we have some influence to nature,</v>

646
00:29:12.628 --> 00:29:15.411
mostly be polluting nature.

647
00:29:15.411 --> 00:29:20.411
This nature pollution has effect on our gene forms.

648
00:29:21.356 --> 00:29:26.062
Genetic profile of people now is changeable.

649
00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:31.779
We can see this in second generation,

650
00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:35.416
in children, because we have more and more children

651
00:29:35.416 --> 00:29:39.341
who are born with some problems.

652
00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:40.408
<v Regina>Birth defects.</v>

653
00:29:40.408 --> 00:29:42.157
<v ->Genetically embedded problems,</v>

654
00:29:42.157 --> 00:29:46.797
due to genetically modified DNA of their parents.

655
00:29:46.797 --> 00:29:51.255
We should understand that our ecology signs

656
00:29:51.255 --> 00:29:56.255
and our troubles, those are not just for animals,

657
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:58.755
but for ourself.

658
00:29:58.755 --> 00:30:02.723
If you wouldn't take care of this pollution,

659
00:30:02.723 --> 00:30:05.251
of this food that is polluted,

660
00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:07.554
of water that is polluted,

661
00:30:07.554 --> 00:30:10.967
if we wouldn't take care of ourself,

662
00:30:10.967 --> 00:30:13.037
then we need to understand that

663
00:30:13.037 --> 00:30:15.543
we'll have this problem in next generations.

664
00:30:15.543 --> 00:30:17.186
<v Regina>And the subsequent generations.</v>

665
00:30:17.186 --> 00:30:17.975
<v ->Yes.</v>

666
00:30:17.975 --> 00:30:20.001
<v Regina>Let's take one subject of just</v>

667
00:30:20.001 --> 00:30:25.001
mad cow disease itself, and the genesis of mad cow disease.

668
00:30:25.228 --> 00:30:30.006
<v ->At the beginning, it was unclear what has happened,</v>

669
00:30:30.006 --> 00:30:33.633
but then it was studied and demonstrated absolutely exactly.

670
00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:38.528
It was idea to feed cows, to add to cow food,

671
00:30:38.528 --> 00:30:43.083
some meat, processed meat, because at factories

672
00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:46.581
which produce meat, they have a lot of leftovers

673
00:30:46.581 --> 00:30:49.184
that was just destroyed somehow.

674
00:30:49.184 --> 00:30:51.904
Someone came to clever idea to process

675
00:30:51.904 --> 00:30:56.129
those leftovers to produce some powder,

676
00:30:56.129 --> 00:31:00.449
and to add this powder to cow's food.

677
00:31:00.449 --> 00:31:03.094
It was found that cows, they grow much faster.

678
00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:08.022
They accept weight because they have direct Albumin

679
00:31:08.022 --> 00:31:12.343
Because you know that from grass, also of some other food.

680
00:31:12.343 --> 00:31:16.323
they have long three stage processing of food

681
00:31:16.323 --> 00:31:18.765
to get to Albumin.

682
00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:21.475
Here, they get direct Albumin and it was found

683
00:31:21.475 --> 00:31:23.522
that they grow up much faster.

684
00:31:23.522 --> 00:31:28.522
But then it has created this problem of cow madness,

685
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:33.111
because somehow it had this, those Albumins,

686
00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:37.847
they had absolutely disastrous effect on cow's brain.

687
00:31:37.847 --> 00:31:41.676
It was found that this is a danger for people as well,

688
00:31:41.676 --> 00:31:43.116
because this is --

689
00:31:43.116 --> 00:31:44.525
<v Regina>And this is still a common practice.</v>

690
00:31:44.525 --> 00:31:47.448
This is still what the cows, commercially, are fed.

691
00:31:47.448 --> 00:31:52.162
<v ->As I know, in most countries, it is forbidden now.</v>

692
00:31:52.162 --> 00:31:53.111
<v Regina>Is it?</v>

693
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.210
<v ->It is forbidden, yes, yes, yes, as I know.</v>

694
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.238
Because when they found the reason,

695
00:31:56.238 --> 00:32:01.238
of course, they made special regulations that forbid it.

696
00:32:01.784 --> 00:32:05.485
<v Regina>These kinds of rendered meats and fats are --</v>

697
00:32:05.485 --> 00:32:08.700
<v ->That's why it was a problem only for developed countries.</v>

698
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.598
In Russia, we never had this problem because --

699
00:32:10.598 --> 00:32:11.857
<v Regina>Well, when cows graze on grass,</v>

700
00:32:11.857 --> 00:32:13.382
you're not going to have mad cow disease.

701
00:32:13.382 --> 00:32:14.523
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

702
00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:17.307
<v Regina>Also, you were talking about</v>

703
00:32:17.307 --> 00:32:19.931
utilizing all of the senses, and one of the things

704
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:23.792
you mentioned today was also the sense of smell.

705
00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:25.669
Can you talk about the nature of --

706
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:27.994
There was a Nobel Prize that was awarded

707
00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:29.456
for a study on the sense of smell.

708
00:32:29.456 --> 00:32:32.613
How do the senses play in, and particularly,

709
00:32:32.613 --> 00:32:35.419
the sense of scent?

710
00:32:35.419 --> 00:32:36.518
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

711
00:32:36.518 --> 00:32:40.528
You see, in our life, the sense of smell

712
00:32:40.528 --> 00:32:44.944
plays very important role that people don't understand.

713
00:32:44.944 --> 00:32:49.008
Because we just smell some perfumes,

714
00:32:49.008 --> 00:32:51.930
we sometimes smell food, and that's it.

715
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:56.924
But in reality, we constantly react to different smells.

716
00:32:56.924 --> 00:33:00.521
This has a subconscious reaction.

717
00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:05.417
For animals, it is one of the main source of information.

718
00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:06.697
<v Regina>For survival,.</v>

719
00:33:06.697 --> 00:33:09.942
<v ->For survival, for operating the environment,</v>

720
00:33:09.942 --> 00:33:14.508
for intercommunication, this the main source.

721
00:33:14.508 --> 00:33:17.995
Any dog, any cat, that would always smell everything.

722
00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:20.502
For us, of course, it's much less important.

723
00:33:20.502 --> 00:33:22.870
But anyway, we react to smell because we are

724
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.843
part of animal kingdom.

725
00:33:24.843 --> 00:33:29.440
The smell of food, it triggers a lot of physiological

726
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.597
mechanisms in our digestive system.

727
00:33:32.597 --> 00:33:35.968
When we have this good smell, we immediately trigger

728
00:33:35.968 --> 00:33:40.863
some process in our stomach to be prepared

729
00:33:40.863 --> 00:33:42.676
for the particular food.

730
00:33:42.676 --> 00:33:47.676
That's why it is so bad to have food with artificial smell.

731
00:33:48.873 --> 00:33:51.893
<v Regina>And also have other elements in the environment</v>

732
00:33:51.893 --> 00:33:55.050
that destroy our sense of smell, certain chemicals.

733
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.053
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

734
00:33:56.053 --> 00:33:57.514
Of course, of course, sure.

735
00:33:57.514 --> 00:34:01.418
Of course, we should understand that smell,

736
00:34:01.418 --> 00:34:04.063
it is a strong sexual attractor.

737
00:34:04.063 --> 00:34:07.967
We need to use perfumes, we need to use

738
00:34:07.967 --> 00:34:12.967
different cosmetics, and to use it clever.

739
00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:18.110
When some people, they mix different cosmetics together,

740
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.319
then, of course, it creates very funny effect.

741
00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:22.217
<v Regina>Right, a funny effect. (laughs)</v>

742
00:34:22.217 --> 00:34:27.027
When you look at the lack of our ability

743
00:34:27.027 --> 00:34:30.739
in the developed world to have a full-blown

744
00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.277
sense of smell in operation because the foods

745
00:34:33.277 --> 00:34:34.600
don't particularly have them.

746
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.232
If you go buy flowers at the market,

747
00:34:36.232 --> 00:34:38.461
they've been raised, also factory raised,

748
00:34:38.461 --> 00:34:41.064
so you're not smelling those flowers in the same way.

749
00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.591
You're saying that on an energetic level,

750
00:34:43.591 --> 00:34:46.098
if this isn't beginning the processes

751
00:34:46.098 --> 00:34:50.599
of opening up, starting the digestive enzymes and so forth,

752
00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:53.457
what is the net effect of that when we go about

753
00:34:53.457 --> 00:34:55.548
then consuming our food?

754
00:34:55.548 --> 00:34:58.449
<v ->Yeah, of course, if it is artificial food,</v>

755
00:34:58.449 --> 00:35:03.449
it has no smell, then it creates no signals to our system.

756
00:35:03.515 --> 00:35:07.366
But, at the same time, it's the signal that it's artificial.

757
00:35:07.366 --> 00:35:08.624
<v Regina>Well, okay. (laughing)</v>

758
00:35:08.624 --> 00:35:11.901
<v ->It's funny that you mentioned flowers.</v>

759
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:15.591
I had one friend who came from United States,

760
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:17.575
living there maybe for 10 years,

761
00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:19.100
and she came back to Russia.

762
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.287
She thought the worst impression was that,

763
00:35:21.287 --> 00:35:24.561
in the United States, no flowers have smell.

764
00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:27.441
<v Regina>Yes, unless they're wild or in your back yard.</v>

765
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:28.881
<v ->Yes, yes, absolutely.</v>

766
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:30.502
<v Regina>Exactly, that's very true.</v>

767
00:35:30.502 --> 00:35:34.406
You send your lover or sweetie a bouquet

768
00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:38.075
of a dozen red roses and there's no scent.

769
00:35:38.075 --> 00:35:40.646
It's lost half of its beauty right there.

770
00:35:40.646 --> 00:35:42.757
<v ->Yes, absolutely, it's very pity.</v>

771
00:35:42.757 --> 00:35:46.288
Smell is related to our memory,

772
00:35:46.288 --> 00:35:49.680
that's why when we have something significant in our life

773
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.741
and we have some smell with this,

774
00:35:52.741 --> 00:35:56.805
then this just particular smell can trigger this recall,

775
00:35:56.805 --> 00:35:59.268
trigger these memories.

776
00:35:59.268 --> 00:36:01.060
<v Regina>Another common element of our lives</v>

777
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.769
in the developed world, and undeveloped world,

778
00:36:03.769 --> 00:36:06.151
or third-world nations, as it was said,

779
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:07.473
is cell phones.

780
00:36:07.473 --> 00:36:08.551
They're everywhere now.

781
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:12.039
You have measured the effects of what happens

782
00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:14.748
to a person when they're talking on a cellphone

783
00:36:14.748 --> 00:36:16.380
for as little as 10 minutes.

784
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.398
Can you talk about some of your findings?

785
00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:24.176
<v ->We have done a very precise blind study,</v>

786
00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:28.176
where people was keeping cell phones nearby their head,

787
00:36:28.176 --> 00:36:30.192
and some cellphones were turned on,

788
00:36:30.192 --> 00:36:32.400
some cellphones were turned off.

789
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.674
It was found, first of all, significant difference,

790
00:36:35.674 --> 00:36:39.226
statistically significant, and it was found that

791
00:36:39.226 --> 00:36:43.226
people really react to cellphone emanation,

792
00:36:43.226 --> 00:36:45.062
but very differently.

793
00:36:45.062 --> 00:36:48.913
For some, it is quite little reaction, non-significant.

794
00:36:48.913 --> 00:36:52.123
For some, it is really strong significant reactions.

795
00:36:52.123 --> 00:36:53.510
<v Regina>Even the average was quite,</v>

796
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.632
looking at your charts, the average reaction

797
00:36:55.632 --> 00:36:57.211
was still significant.

798
00:36:57.211 --> 00:37:01.243
<v ->Yes, very significant, because about 10% of population</v>

799
00:37:01.243 --> 00:37:03.589
react very significantly.

800
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:07.494
When we average in a group, say about 30 people,

801
00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:10.331
we have significant reaction to cellphone.

802
00:37:10.331 --> 00:37:12.923
But what is most important is this reaction lasts

803
00:37:12.923 --> 00:37:16.062
for quite a long time.

804
00:37:16.062 --> 00:37:18.942
Even when people stop using cellphone,

805
00:37:18.942 --> 00:37:23.219
they still have this change in their condition.

806
00:37:23.219 --> 00:37:25.843
First of all, it is heart rate.

807
00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:27.187
It is immune system.

808
00:37:27.187 --> 00:37:28.606
It is energy system.

809
00:37:28.606 --> 00:37:32.203
It really has some effect.

810
00:37:32.203 --> 00:37:34.090
<v Regina>It drops for as much as, what?</v>

811
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.181
How long does it take for a person to start recovering

812
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:38.591
from their 10 minute cellphone call?

813
00:37:38.591 --> 00:37:41.866
<v ->About half an hour, from half an hour to an hour,</v>

814
00:37:41.866 --> 00:37:43.562
depending on the person as well.

815
00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:45.183
<v Regina>If you spend all day on the cellphone,</v>

816
00:37:45.183 --> 00:37:48.511
especially kids and teenagers, then what's happening?

817
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:51.573
<v ->It may be absolutely dramatic, absolutely.</v>

818
00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:53.237
<v Regina>Brain tumors, do you think there's a link?</v>

819
00:37:53.237 --> 00:37:55.189
<v ->They may develop a lot of different problems.</v>

820
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:58.508
It may be brain problems, and a lot of cases now,

821
00:37:58.508 --> 00:38:02.604
as we know, we have increase of brain problems

822
00:38:02.604 --> 00:38:06.454
with children and young generation, strong increase.

823
00:38:06.454 --> 00:38:11.454
It is, a lot of doctors, they decided that it's

824
00:38:11.799 --> 00:38:13.600
related to cellphone using.

825
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.925
<v Regina>What can we do to ameliorate those problems?</v>

826
00:38:15.925 --> 00:38:19.669
<v ->First of all, we need to use the modern cellphones.</v>

827
00:38:19.669 --> 00:38:24.173
Because the older the model, the higher the influence.

828
00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:25.303
<v Regina>The more the radiation.</v>

829
00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.935
<v ->Yes, because in modern cellphones,</v>

830
00:38:26.935 --> 00:38:29.623
they try to diminish radiation.

831
00:38:29.623 --> 00:38:32.386
They try to use higher frequency,

832
00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:34.498
and higher frequency is less influence.

833
00:38:34.498 --> 00:38:39.116
They try to use impulse settings,

834
00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.484
and again, it's less influence.

835
00:38:41.484 --> 00:38:46.315
Second, we need to use some earphones.

836
00:38:46.315 --> 00:38:47.298
<v Regina>Earpiece.</v>

837
00:38:47.298 --> 00:38:48.683
<v ->Earpiece, yes, yes, yes.</v>

838
00:38:48.683 --> 00:38:50.123
<v Regina>Just get the phone away from your --</v>

839
00:38:50.123 --> 00:38:51.286
<v ->Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

840
00:38:51.286 --> 00:38:53.238
Just to keep it away from our bodies.

841
00:38:53.238 --> 00:38:56.907
<v Regina>You're saying, not just your ear, your body?</v>

842
00:38:56.907 --> 00:38:57.792
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

843
00:38:57.792 --> 00:38:59.456
<v Regina>What if you keep it in the breast pocket</v>

844
00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:00.992
of your jacket?

845
00:39:00.992 --> 00:39:02.016
<v ->It is very bad.</v>

846
00:39:02.016 --> 00:39:05.942
It is a worst station, mostly for women.

847
00:39:05.942 --> 00:39:09.098
It may really have dramatic outcome,

848
00:39:09.098 --> 00:39:12.511
because the increase of breast cancer

849
00:39:12.511 --> 00:39:13.812
in developed countries.

850
00:39:13.812 --> 00:39:16.522
It was exactly related to the development

851
00:39:16.522 --> 00:39:19.263
of these network connections.

852
00:39:19.263 --> 00:39:24.263
We have all, of course, it's only suspicion.

853
00:39:24.745 --> 00:39:26.228
We can't tell for sure.

854
00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:28.969
Absolutely it's possible to tell for sure.

855
00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:30.782
But as we have some probability,

856
00:39:30.782 --> 00:39:32.087
it's better to keep it away.

857
00:39:32.087 --> 00:39:32.951
<v Regina>Right.</v>

858
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:36.780
<v ->The best to keep it is outside of the body in purse,</v>

859
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.133
or just in the back pocket.

860
00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:42.246
<v Regina>But then you sit on it. (laughs)</v>

861
00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:43.546
<v ->Yes, well it depends.</v>

862
00:39:43.546 --> 00:39:44.890
<v Regina>But you've got a lot of cushion there</v>

863
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:46.480
to keep it away from other organs.

864
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.739
<v ->Yes, yes, yes.</v>

865
00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:49.712
It is better to keep it away from main organs,

866
00:39:49.712 --> 00:39:54.035
like heart, like liver, like kidney, like genital organs,

867
00:39:54.035 --> 00:39:56.885
because it has some influence for sure.

868
00:39:56.885 --> 00:40:00.245
At the same time, we don't want to reject them totally.

869
00:40:00.245 --> 00:40:02.593
We will use it, for sure, but we need to take care,

870
00:40:02.593 --> 00:40:05.291
first of all, to keep them away,

871
00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:08.216
to use the different earpieces,

872
00:40:08.216 --> 00:40:10.493
to increase our immune system,

873
00:40:10.493 --> 00:40:14.141
and to use different protective devices,

874
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:15.666
protective sets.

875
00:40:15.666 --> 00:40:17.106
<v Regina>When you're traveling around the world,</v>

876
00:40:17.106 --> 00:40:18.781
you go to a lot of exotic places,

877
00:40:18.781 --> 00:40:21.085
you go to a lot of pristine places,

878
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.219
and you take your instrumentation with you

879
00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:26.280
and you measure energy signatures from water,

880
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.350
from mountaintops, from various places,

881
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:33.350
and a lot of this is really lending credence to

882
00:40:33.384 --> 00:40:35.293
what was known throughout history

883
00:40:35.293 --> 00:40:36.989
before in ancient times.

884
00:40:36.989 --> 00:40:38.098
<v ->Sure.</v>

885
00:40:38.098 --> 00:40:40.562
<v Regina>what are some of those essential truths</v>

886
00:40:40.562 --> 00:40:43.623
that you have learned through being able to

887
00:40:43.623 --> 00:40:46.130
measure the fields scientifically?

888
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.778
<v ->You know, there was a lot of historical anecdotes</v>

889
00:40:49.778 --> 00:40:53.191
that it was places of high energy,

890
00:40:53.191 --> 00:40:58.022
where people gathered, where they had different ceremonies,

891
00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:00.326
where later they have been creating different

892
00:41:00.326 --> 00:41:05.326
church buildings, temples, and one of our aim is

893
00:41:05.554 --> 00:41:08.231
to support these claims, to find out

894
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:12.093
whether it's real or it's just anecdotal evidence.

895
00:41:12.093 --> 00:41:14.557
In our measurements, we've really found that

896
00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:17.661
there are a lot of places that have been considered

897
00:41:17.661 --> 00:41:22.412
as holy places, as sacred places, that have really

898
00:41:22.412 --> 00:41:25.675
very specific energy patterns.

899
00:41:25.675 --> 00:41:27.510
Because we can measure in different substances,

900
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.217
in water, in air, in soil, in vegetation,

901
00:41:31.217 --> 00:41:36.217
and it was found a lot of confirmations of those facts.

902
00:41:36.774 --> 00:41:38.556
<v Regina>What are a few of the places on the planet</v>

903
00:41:38.556 --> 00:41:40.785
that you saw what you would expect to,

904
00:41:40.785 --> 00:41:45.083
in terms of the high energy output of a given area?

905
00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:49.083
<v ->We need to take into account one moment.</v>

906
00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:51.609
When there are a lot of people around,

907
00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:54.926
then their influence is much more stronger

908
00:41:54.926 --> 00:41:57.176
than the influence of place itself.

909
00:41:57.176 --> 00:42:02.107
That's why, for example, when I've been to Machu Picchu,

910
00:42:02.107 --> 00:42:04.037
we've tried to make measurements,

911
00:42:04.037 --> 00:42:06.661
but it was nothing significant,

912
00:42:06.661 --> 00:42:10.255
because it was so many tourists around.

913
00:42:10.255 --> 00:42:12.837
Human energy, it is very strong.

914
00:42:12.837 --> 00:42:15.204
It has strong influence to everything.

915
00:42:15.204 --> 00:42:17.988
We try to measure where we can get access

916
00:42:17.988 --> 00:42:21.871
to the places at night, or without people,

917
00:42:21.871 --> 00:42:25.838
or at some special stations.

918
00:42:25.838 --> 00:42:28.571
Of course, our experience is not that big.

919
00:42:28.571 --> 00:42:31.526
We've been measuring and had very high effects

920
00:42:31.526 --> 00:42:36.526
in Russian monasteries, in far north of Russia,

921
00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:41.121
where it is very remote monasteries in islands,

922
00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:43.363
in (indistinct speech)

923
00:42:43.363 --> 00:42:46.360
that was very high energy output.

924
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.342
Then it is tiny islands with spirals.

925
00:42:50.342 --> 00:42:51.664
<v Regina>Oh, the labyrinths.</v>

926
00:42:51.664 --> 00:42:52.763
<v ->Labyrinths, yes, yes.</v>

927
00:42:52.763 --> 00:42:55.472
<v Regina>Like crop circles, very powerful the geometry.</v>

928
00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:58.608
<v ->Yes, absolutely, it was created in Celtic times</v>

929
00:42:58.608 --> 00:43:03.608
by ancient civilizations, and of course, again,

930
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.415
had very strong energies.

931
00:43:06.415 --> 00:43:09.477
Then we've been measuring in natural places,

932
00:43:09.477 --> 00:43:12.469
like (indistinct speech), waterfalls,

933
00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:16.895
in different plateaus and mountains,

934
00:43:16.895 --> 00:43:20.586
and again, we've found very high energy outputs.

935
00:43:20.586 --> 00:43:23.658
The final findings was in the crop circles.

936
00:43:23.658 --> 00:43:24.564
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

937
00:43:24.564 --> 00:43:27.348
<v ->It was only one measurement, but it was very interesting.</v>

938
00:43:27.348 --> 00:43:30.212
We plan to make it again this summer,

939
00:43:30.212 --> 00:43:31.812
and to see whether it is --

940
00:43:31.812 --> 00:43:33.252
<v Regina>Well, it's interesting because</v>

941
00:43:33.252 --> 00:43:37.785
I have heard of this, other people using magnometers,

942
00:43:37.785 --> 00:43:40.729
and so forth, simple devices, in that there's

943
00:43:40.729 --> 00:43:44.376
all this debate as to what's an authentic crop circle,

944
00:43:44.376 --> 00:43:46.467
versus a man-made crop circle.

945
00:43:46.467 --> 00:43:49.955
What's interesting is the geometry itself

946
00:43:49.955 --> 00:43:53.528
also seems to be producing a signature,

947
00:43:53.528 --> 00:43:55.010
an energetic signature.

948
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.269
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

949
00:43:56.269 --> 00:43:57.293
You are absolutely right.

950
00:43:57.293 --> 00:43:59.885
It is a lot of controversy, whether it is authentic,

951
00:43:59.885 --> 00:44:01.677
whether it is man-made,

952
00:44:01.677 --> 00:44:04.908
and again, we don't know whether it is the influence

953
00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:09.111
of place itself that attracted this crop circle,

954
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:12.526
or crop circle that influenced the place.

955
00:44:12.526 --> 00:44:14.470
At the moment, it is just a question.

956
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:15.345
<v Regina>Right.</v>

957
00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:16.721
<v ->But to answer the question, of course,</v>

958
00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:18.694
we need to make different measurements.

959
00:44:18.694 --> 00:44:23.694
As I know, it was interesting data by using magnetometers.

960
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.684
Then we have interesting data with our instrument.

961
00:44:26.684 --> 00:44:31.461
Simple devices, they practically have no real output

962
00:44:31.461 --> 00:44:35.312
and all the measurement of radioactivity say no,

963
00:44:35.312 --> 00:44:38.193
they were not significant.

964
00:44:38.193 --> 00:44:43.193
As this research is just non-supported by anyone,

965
00:44:43.302 --> 00:44:46.325
it is just by interested people who do this.

966
00:44:46.325 --> 00:44:48.802
Of course, it comes very slow because

967
00:44:48.802 --> 00:44:51.426
any scientific research needs funding.

968
00:44:51.426 --> 00:44:53.634
<v Regina>Right, right, and these are rather esoteric,</v>

969
00:44:53.634 --> 00:44:56.974
low on the list for corporate funding certainly. (laughter)

970
00:44:56.974 --> 00:44:58.691
<v ->Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

971
00:44:58.691 --> 00:45:01.827
It is easy to come somewhere and meditate,

972
00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:04.078
you need only just little money for travel,

973
00:45:04.078 --> 00:45:06.499
but if you need to carry around all your equipment,

974
00:45:06.499 --> 00:45:08.077
then it's much more complicated.

975
00:45:08.077 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

976
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.120
Well, let's come full circle back to human beings again

977
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.602
and the energy output.

978
00:45:13.602 --> 00:45:15.714
The point you made a little bit ago is important,

979
00:45:15.714 --> 00:45:18.242
that human beings possess a great amount of energy

980
00:45:18.242 --> 00:45:20.034
and energy influence.

981
00:45:20.034 --> 00:45:24.488
What happens where two or more gather, as they say?

982
00:45:25.658 --> 00:45:26.617
<v ->You mean --</v>

983
00:45:26.617 --> 00:45:29.514
<v Regina>Where people come together with intention.</v>

984
00:45:29.514 --> 00:45:32.373
<v ->Yeah, with our camera, electrophotonic camera,</v>

985
00:45:32.373 --> 00:45:35.530
we can measure the influence of people to each other.

986
00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.346
Because this camera, for one hand, is very sensitive.

987
00:45:38.346 --> 00:45:40.543
From other hand, it's very stable.

988
00:45:40.543 --> 00:45:42.633
That's why we can use it in medicine.

989
00:45:42.633 --> 00:45:47.633
When people meet each other with intention,

990
00:45:47.646 --> 00:45:50.367
would it be love, or hatred,

991
00:45:50.367 --> 00:45:53.481
then they really strongly influence each other.

992
00:45:53.481 --> 00:45:57.465
It may be done even without conscious understanding.

993
00:45:57.465 --> 00:46:00.761
You know, this notion of gaze from the back.

994
00:46:00.761 --> 00:46:04.430
It's very well-known, it was studied, it really exists.

995
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.451
We see this in real experiments.

996
00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:12.654
We have a person seated in a comfortable position

997
00:46:12.654 --> 00:46:16.024
in a chair, and then other people come from the back.

998
00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:18.616
This person, he doesn't know who's coming

999
00:46:18.616 --> 00:46:20.482
and whether they are coming or not.

1000
00:46:20.482 --> 00:46:23.586
We really can see a tremendous difference

1001
00:46:23.586 --> 00:46:28.586
for people who have no connection with this person

1002
00:46:29.229 --> 00:46:33.388
and, for example, for fiance or love being

1003
00:46:33.388 --> 00:46:35.266
who comes from the back.

1004
00:46:35.266 --> 00:46:39.916
It is clear evidence that we influence each other.

1005
00:46:39.916 --> 00:46:41.047
<v Regina>We influence each other,</v>

1006
00:46:41.047 --> 00:46:43.788
so we should have some kind of clear intentionality.

1007
00:46:43.788 --> 00:46:45.697
We should be somewhat aware and conscious of

1008
00:46:45.697 --> 00:46:48.619
how we're interfacing with others in the world.

1009
00:46:48.619 --> 00:46:49.803
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

1010
00:46:49.803 --> 00:46:54.422
We should understand that if we send positive emotions,

1011
00:46:54.422 --> 00:46:56.555
if we send love to each other,

1012
00:46:56.555 --> 00:47:00.853
then we increase, not only other person's energy field

1013
00:47:00.853 --> 00:47:02.389
but our own energy field.

1014
00:47:02.389 --> 00:47:06.356
<v Regina>Yes, and we're also working through the waters.</v>

1015
00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:08.032
We're working through the waters of the body.

1016
00:47:08.032 --> 00:47:10.442
<v ->Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

1017
00:47:10.442 --> 00:47:14.783
When people send hatred, when they send envy,

1018
00:47:14.783 --> 00:47:16.831
negative emotions, they first of all,

1019
00:47:16.831 --> 00:47:19.831
decrease their own immune system.

1020
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:20.951
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1021
00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:24.758
That's why all bad witches, they were always

1022
00:47:24.758 --> 00:47:26.732
presented as very ugly creatures.

1023
00:47:26.732 --> 00:47:27.841
<v Regina>Yes, yes.</v>

1024
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:31.393
<v ->All fairy tale fairies were very nice always,</v>

1025
00:47:31.393 --> 00:47:32.886
because it's understandable.

1026
00:47:32.886 --> 00:47:34.784
<v Regina>So, you not only damage your own field,</v>

1027
00:47:34.784 --> 00:47:36.619
but you damage the person that you're

1028
00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:39.296
sending these intentions to in some cases.

1029
00:47:39.296 --> 00:47:40.427
<v ->Of course.</v>

1030
00:47:40.427 --> 00:47:42.315
<v Regina>Really, the key here is,</v>

1031
00:47:42.315 --> 00:47:47.168
this is in a universe made of energy.

1032
00:47:47.168 --> 00:47:49.087
We can't ignore this fact anymore.

1033
00:47:49.087 --> 00:47:52.415
Matter is almost irrelevant compared to

1034
00:47:52.415 --> 00:47:54.881
the subject of energy.

1035
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.594
It seems essential, and really, training the children

1036
00:47:58.594 --> 00:48:01.142
from an early age to understand this.

1037
00:48:01.142 --> 00:48:04.139
Is this, in your opinion, a critical part of it?

1038
00:48:04.139 --> 00:48:06.272
<v ->Yes, absolutely, because children,</v>

1039
00:48:06.272 --> 00:48:09.067
they are very susceptible to this information.

1040
00:48:09.067 --> 00:48:11.477
For them, it's very easily understandable.

1041
00:48:11.477 --> 00:48:14.433
They don't have these prejudices as people

1042
00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:15.800
with higher education.

1043
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.677
<v Regina>The prejudices, yeah.</v>

1044
00:48:17.677 --> 00:48:21.069
<v ->Yes, yes, and if they are trained how,</v>

1045
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:25.410
if they see in instruments how it is really effective,

1046
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.916
then they change their attitude to each other.

1047
00:48:27.916 --> 00:48:29.495
<v Regina>Are they doing this in Russia?</v>

1048
00:48:29.495 --> 00:48:30.519
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

1049
00:48:30.519 --> 00:48:32.055
<v Regina>Are they teaching children to recognize</v>

1050
00:48:32.055 --> 00:48:33.299
and utilize energy?

1051
00:48:33.299 --> 00:48:34.226
<v Regina>Yes?</v>

1052
00:48:34.226 --> 00:48:35.570
<v ->Yes, we do this.</v>

1053
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.383
<v Regina>From what age, from the earliest ages?</v>

1054
00:48:37.383 --> 00:48:40.423
<v ->In school, they do it in school.</v>

1055
00:48:40.423 --> 00:48:43.580
They demonstrate how it works and the children

1056
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.928
are very, very interested in this.

1057
00:48:45.928 --> 00:48:48.178
In our last conference last year,

1058
00:48:48.178 --> 00:48:52.434
we had a group of children who done real research

1059
00:48:52.434 --> 00:48:54.686
and studying the influence of

1060
00:48:54.686 --> 00:48:57.353
different subject's energy fields.

1061
00:48:57.353 --> 00:49:00.425
<v Regina>Well, it's my hope that some of</v>

1062
00:49:00.425 --> 00:49:03.048
the other countries of the world, including the U.S.

1063
00:49:03.048 --> 00:49:05.672
where we are right now in Santa Fe,

1064
00:49:05.672 --> 00:49:08.595
can take some notice of what you're doing

1065
00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:11.101
in the Soviet Union on so many levels

1066
00:49:11.101 --> 00:49:13.309
with the understanding of our connection,

1067
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:14.578
not our connection to,

1068
00:49:14.578 --> 00:49:18.482
of our universal makeup of energy.

1069
00:49:18.482 --> 00:49:22.034
<v ->Yes, I am absolutely sure that it's coming.</v>

1070
00:49:22.034 --> 00:49:26.354
Of course, maybe not as fast as we would have desired.

1071
00:49:26.354 --> 00:49:27.868
<v Regina>You're doing your part though.</v>

1072
00:49:27.868 --> 00:49:28.881
<v ->Yes, we are doing --</v>

1073
00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:30.492
<v Regina>You're out there educating around the world.</v>

1074
00:49:30.492 --> 00:49:32.295
You have a crazy work schedule.

1075
00:49:32.295 --> 00:49:33.649
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

1076
00:49:33.649 --> 00:49:35.366
<v Regina>I thank you so much for taking the time.</v>

1077
00:49:35.366 --> 00:49:37.265
I know you're very busy and you fly out tomorrow.

1078
00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:40.422
I also want to tell you, I really like your hairdo.

1079
00:49:40.422 --> 00:49:41.798
<v ->Oh, thank you very much. (laughing)</v>

1080
00:49:41.798 --> 00:49:43.558
<v Regina>I saw pictures of you with hair.</v>

1081
00:49:43.558 --> 00:49:45.232
This is good. (laughing)

1082
00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:47.579
<v ->Thank you very much, thank you very much.</v>

1083
00:49:47.579 --> 00:49:48.944
It looks nice.

1084
00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:51.248
<v Regina>It looks very hip and you're very handsome</v>

1085
00:49:51.248 --> 00:49:52.731
with this hairdo. (laughs)

1086
00:49:52.731 --> 00:49:53.957
<v ->Oh, thank you very much.</v>

1087
00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.098
Wonderful, wonderful.

1088
00:49:55.098 --> 00:49:55.889
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1089
00:49:55.889 --> 00:49:56.955
<v ->Okay, wonderful, thank you.</v>

1090
00:49:56.955 --> 00:49:58.694
It was a tremendous pleasure being with you.

1091
00:49:58.694 --> 00:49:59.487
Tremendous pleasure.

1092
00:49:59.487 --> 00:50:00.351
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1093
00:50:00.351 --> 00:50:01.631
You have wonderful energy,

1094
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:04.042
and you both work as a team,

1095
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:06.452
so it's been such a pleasure.

1096
00:50:06.452 --> 00:50:08.105
<v Regina>That's nice to hear you say,</v>

1097
00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:09.407
being the energy man.

1098
00:50:09.407 --> 00:50:10.825
<v ->Yes, thank you, thank you.</v>

1099
00:50:12.032 --> 00:50:13.429
<v ->I can't tell you what a pleasure it was</v>

1100
00:50:13.429 --> 00:50:14.709
spending time with this man.

1101
00:50:14.709 --> 00:50:17.099
If you'd like to know more about his ground-breaking work,

1102
00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:19.189
you can go to his website at the link below.

1103
00:50:19.189 --> 00:50:21.365
Meanwhile, you might also enjoy our interview

1104
00:50:21.365 --> 00:50:24.319
with Harry Oldfield and his photography technology,

1105
00:50:24.319 --> 00:50:28.031
which also captures energy around biological organisms,

1106
00:50:28.031 --> 00:50:30.260
including the early detection of disease.

1107
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.996
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1108
