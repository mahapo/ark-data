1
00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:15.616
<v ->Gregory Sams was dealt a challenging blow as a young man</v>

2
00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:17.410
when he fell from a tree and was paralyzed

3
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.693
from the waist down.

4
00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:20.191
But this did not stop him,

5
00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.082
not in business, where he created the Veggie Burger Company,

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.498
and later as an author,

7
00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:26.547
whose life long fascination has been

8
00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:28.086
with the power of the sun.

9
00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:30.907
Gregory has put his findings into a book titled,

10
00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:31.998
"Sun of God,"

11
00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:33.989
in which he says the sun is the source of

12
00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.694
vast amounts of intelligence, information that

13
00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.105
we cannot live without.

14
00:00:51.137 --> 00:00:52.774
<v Interviewer>Gregory, I'm fascinated with</v>

15
00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:55.410
the subject of the sun, as you are, obviously,

16
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.674
being the author and taking the time

17
00:00:57.674 --> 00:00:58.655
to write "Sun of God,"

18
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.853
let's talk a little bit about the history

19
00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.651
and how humanity has deliberately been driven

20
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:08.692
away from the understanding of, contact of,

21
00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:10.512
and appreciation of the sun.

22
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.460
<v ->Okay, I mean, I characterize this as</v>

23
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.717
the biggest and longest-running cover up in history.

24
00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.690
How can you cover up something like the sun?

25
00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.617
And it's the biggest elephant in the room,

26
00:01:22.168 --> 00:01:25.413
because there's this huge ball of life

27
00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:27.364
that brings us the light of life

28
00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.462
that rises every day, travels across our sky,

29
00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.029
and we're just oblivious to it.

30
00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:35.171
People spend more time thinking about

31
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:38.800
what type of sunglasses they're gonna wear in their life

32
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:40.558
than they do thinking about the nature of

33
00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.108
the most important thing in our life,

34
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.016
and it was once common knowledge,

35
00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:46.723
anywhere you went in the world,

36
00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:49.887
any continent you pick, any culture, any century,

37
00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.823
people recognized that this was, the source of life

38
00:01:53.898 --> 00:01:55.901
was itself a life form,

39
00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.545
and that's the instinctive, natural mode,

40
00:02:00.643 --> 00:02:04.701
and of course, when the Abrahamic religions came out,

41
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.397
this was the biggest competition.

42
00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.928
Sun worship was something people did everywhere,

43
00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:12.871
and there was like hundreds of years,

44
00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:16.470
several hundred years of assiduous suppression of this,

45
00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.873
and there are battles that raged back and forth,

46
00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:22.164
and as we know from today's world,

47
00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:23.784
might is not always right.

48
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.990
Sometimes the bad guys win,

49
00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:29.520
and suppress everything else,

50
00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:34.734
and this, everything pagan was regarded as bad,

51
00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.312
and once the Roman Empire put the stamp of approval

52
00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:41.873
on Christianity, and then made it the official religion

53
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.437
of the Roman Empire, everything else had to be suppressed.

54
00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.245
Even previous Christian gospels, whole Christian communities

55
00:02:49.494 --> 00:02:52.647
and nations were, well in case of the Ophites,

56
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:57.116
were wiped out, because once they believed in Christ

57
00:02:57.192 --> 00:02:59.380
and in aspects of the Biblical story,

58
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.993
they had very different interpretations of it.

59
00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:05.255
So as well as pagans and people who worshiped the sun,

60
00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:08.105
people who didn't follow the same gospels

61
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.440
were wiped out,

62
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.130
and the only record we have of this

63
00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:14.497
is the Nag Hammadi scrolls.

64
00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Interviewer>Mm-hmm.</v>

65
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.521
<v ->You know, that were hidden away by some people</v>

66
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:19.767
who said, "No, we're not burn these documents--"

67
00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:20.551
<v Interviewer>By the Essenes, mm-hmm.</v>

68
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:21.352
<v ->'Cause everybody else was,</v>

69
00:03:21.352 --> 00:03:25.299
and those came out, and what the shepherds didn't use

70
00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.148
to light their fires with, (laughter) the remains we got,

71
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.370
throw a whole different light on the gospel

72
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.771
that still hasn't really come out into the public awareness,

73
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.193
even though the information is there.

74
00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Interviewer>We talked with the author Lucy Wyatt,</v>

75
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.032
and she, was discussed this subject,

76
00:03:44.032 --> 00:03:46.633
and that the Essenes were very much oriented toward

77
00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:49.663
the temples of Tel El Amarna,

78
00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:53.721
and the sun cult, I mean calling it a sun cult

79
00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:55.178
under Akhenaten, for example.

80
00:03:55.392 --> 00:04:00.164
So that was a very prominent part of the scene

81
00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:02.248
back in those days in Palestine.

82
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.798
And yet, yes?

83
00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:07.252
<v ->The Cathars had aspects of sun worship</v>

84
00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.982
in their religion, as well.

85
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.738
As well as not believing in some of the kind of

86
00:04:12.738 --> 00:04:14.044
Christian doctrines,

87
00:04:14.444 --> 00:04:17.063
and they were brutally, half a million or so,

88
00:04:17.846 --> 00:04:20.871
were killed in the 13th, 14th century.

89
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Interviewer>Mm-hmm.</v>

90
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.157
<v ->So, this was sort of lost from our culture.</v>

91
00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:30.577
The Indians still see the sun as a living being,

92
00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:34.193
and I talked to a Hindu about this amazing new book

93
00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:35.969
with bringing new ideas up.

94
00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.612
They said, "What? What do you mean?"

95
00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Interviewer>Well, and Native American Indians, as well,</v>

96
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.938
yes.

97
00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:42.152
<v ->Native Americans, Japanese.</v>

98
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:45.045
<v Interviewer>Aboriginals of every kind around the world,</v>

99
00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:45.602
yes.

100
00:04:45.602 --> 00:04:47.843
<v ->Yeah, and it's just incredibly ungrateful,</v>

101
00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:51.820
and nothing could be less likely

102
00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:55.566
to be a dead ball of gas,

103
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.254
and this is the head set we have now,

104
00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:01.302
and even though solar science discovers more and more

105
00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.146
about the intricate energy patterns of the sun,

106
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.340
and about the heliosphere that embraces

107
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.063
the whole solar system in a protective embrace,

108
00:05:09.063 --> 00:05:13.068
it's still, you know, this is all just accidentally going on

109
00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:16.238
from Newtonian principles, and you could just as well take

110
00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:17.788
a model of the human body,

111
00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:19.959
and say, well this is how the lungs work,

112
00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:23.500
and this is how circulation goes,

113
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.764
and this is what bones are made of,

114
00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:27.882
so it's just an automatic function.

115
00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:28.916
There's no consciousness there.

116
00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:29.967
<v Interviewer>No animating force.</v>

117
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:31.058
<v ->No consciousness there,</v>

118
00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:32.707
so we've figured it all out!

119
00:05:32.817 --> 00:05:35.505
And you know, we do the same with the sun

120
00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:39.081
and with even, you know, oceans and weather systems.

121
00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:40.154
<v Interviewer>Well let's look at this, then.</v>

122
00:05:40.154 --> 00:05:41.327
Who stands to gain?

123
00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:43.161
I mean, you said earlier that it goes in competition

124
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:45.204
with the religions that came up at that time,

125
00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:46.883
say a couple thousand years ago,

126
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.852
but let's look further, who stands to gain,

127
00:05:52.112 --> 00:05:55.323
and what do they gain by keeping humanity

128
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.297
disconnected from the sun?

129
00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:04.558
<v ->If you go, well obviously we have modern reasons</v>

130
00:06:04.558 --> 00:06:08.268
for doing it, but there's a continuum going on

131
00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:12.111
from the story that we have of the Garden of Eden,

132
00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:16.442
where the snake offers a fruit to Adam and Eve,

133
00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:19.541
which is gonna give them knowledge of good and evil,

134
00:06:19.965 --> 00:06:24.185
and give them knowledge of what it's like to feel like God.

135
00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:27.564
This sort of communion with God,

136
00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:32.161
and worship in the old Vedic sense of the word meant

137
00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:35.435
imbuing the qualities of that which you are worshiping.

138
00:06:35.557 --> 00:06:37.519
It wasn't just ritual and bowing and scraping,

139
00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.959
it was imbuing those qualities,

140
00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:41.008
knowing what it's like to be that,

141
00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:44.090
and the Ophites who I mentioned earlier,

142
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.880
they believed that, they worshipped the snake

143
00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:51.213
that was bringing us this knowledge,

144
00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.970
and it was suppresed by Jehovah, who said,

145
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.217
"No, you musn't go there, you musn't know this!"

146
00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:59.120
And knowledge of the divinity of the sun

147
00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.790
is part of that ongoing process.

148
00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:04.762
Now, in the beginning of the 20th century,

149
00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.129
there was radical research,

150
00:07:08.378 --> 00:07:10.231
a scientist won the Nobel prize

151
00:07:10.758 --> 00:07:15.054
for recognizing the important of sunlight to human health

152
00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:16.494
on all sorts of different levels.

153
00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:17.139
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

154
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:19.844
<v ->And they started to design hospitals</v>

155
00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:23.118
so that the wards would receive maximum sunlight.

156
00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:26.380
They had special glass that let UV light through

157
00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:29.137
so that patients could bask in UV light,

158
00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:31.575
and they would step it up,

159
00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:33.038
if you were red haired and white skinned,

160
00:07:33.038 --> 00:07:35.157
you'd only get like 10 minutes a day of that

161
00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:35.923
at the beginning,

162
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:38.559
but they had whole sunlight-based treatments

163
00:07:38.808 --> 00:07:40.335
to cure people of diseases,

164
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:42.263
'cause not only does it make you feel good

165
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.432
and raise your spirits, which helps things heal,

166
00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:49.791
but it also brings us lots of vitamin D,

167
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.607
and has all sorts of physical things that it does, as well.

168
00:07:54.028 --> 00:07:57.239
So that hospital design was being radically changed,

169
00:07:57.663 --> 00:08:01.175
but then, they discovered antibiotics.

170
00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:02.342
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

171
00:08:02.342 --> 00:08:04.710
<v ->And so the antibiotics, you didn't need to spend a week</v>

172
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.312
or two or three curing somebody,

173
00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:08.896
in and out in a couple of days, you know,

174
00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:11.961
and back to dark, dank hospital wards

175
00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:14.736
that all these superbugs now breed happily in,

176
00:08:14.776 --> 00:08:19.292
and spread all the iatrogenic or hospital-generated diseases

177
00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:20.325
through the population,

178
00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:23.815
and nowadays, there's a huge industry

179
00:08:24.656 --> 00:08:29.656
that survives on selling you UV-protective sunglasses,

180
00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:32.040
and chemicals that you rub all over your body

181
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.149
that your body absorbs

182
00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:37.009
to stop this wonderful sunlight from getting through,

183
00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:41.961
and it's been demonized as something like food additives

184
00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:44.399
and radioactive waste, you know,

185
00:08:44.416 --> 00:08:47.069
sunlight, the light of life.

186
00:08:47.353 --> 00:08:48.654
<v Interviewer>But now we equate it</v>

187
00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.012
to dangerous radiation.

188
00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:50.808
<v ->Yeah.</v>

189
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:51.626
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

190
00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:54.993
<v ->And it's just, it's so awful</v>

191
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.843
that people are frightened of the most important thing.

192
00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:00.821
<v Interviewer>It is, and so now we have a chronically</v>

193
00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:02.667
vitamin D3 deficient societies,

194
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.535
which seems to be implicated

195
00:09:05.535 --> 00:09:07.921
in just about every chronic disease known to man,

196
00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:10.504
is vitamin D3 deficiency, among other things,

197
00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:11.961
but that's one of the major ones.

198
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:13.854
<v ->And that's really good for the pharmaceutical industry</v>

199
00:09:13.964 --> 00:09:16.413
if they can step in and do that.
<v Interviewer>Yes, it is.</v>

200
00:09:16.413 --> 00:09:18.143
<v ->And depression, there's so many,</v>

201
00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:23.054
we know that if you go out on a nice, beautiful sunny day,

202
00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:24.389
it lifts our spirits.

203
00:09:24.453 --> 00:09:27.977
Everywhere you go, people are happier on a sunny day

204
00:09:29.724 --> 00:09:32.946
compared to a cold, grey, rainy day, and--

205
00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:35.726
<v Interviewer>And there's an innate love affair</v>

206
00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:37.259
with the sunrises and sunsets.

207
00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:39.417
<v ->Yeah, it's the most beautiful light show on earth,</v>

208
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.267
and yet we don't think, "Why does the sunlight

209
00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:44.388
"lift our spirits?"

210
00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:47.214
And yet you can go into a room and turn the lights up

211
00:09:47.214 --> 00:09:49.316
as bright as you like, and it's not gonna bring

212
00:09:49.316 --> 00:09:50.390
a smile to your face,

213
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:52.415
and you can sit in a sauna at the same time,

214
00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:54.135
and it's not gonna do it.

215
00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:56.272
Sunlight has that difference,

216
00:09:56.347 --> 00:09:57.909
and we rarely think that maybe

217
00:09:58.286 --> 00:10:00.498
it's the old good vibrations,

218
00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:02.936
'cause light is nothing more than a vibration.

219
00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:04.944
And it makes us feel good.

220
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.184
And maybe that's because it's the loving vibration

221
00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:09.484
coming from a living being

222
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:10.877
instead of a bulb in the ceiling.

223
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.048
<v Interviewer>So now let's get into the sun.</v>

224
00:10:13.472 --> 00:10:17.105
We can kind of launch in on any number of levels.

225
00:10:17.105 --> 00:10:18.243
One of them I was intrigued with

226
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.300
that you wrote about in your book

227
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.181
is the seven layers of the sun,

228
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:23.444
and also this fourth state called plasma.

229
00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:26.794
I mean, and then just the sheer power of it alone.

230
00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:30.208
There's this one part in there where you say,

231
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:32.349
"A single solar flare could power the US

232
00:10:32.349 --> 00:10:34.898
"for 40,000 years."

233
00:10:35.086 --> 00:10:35.760
<v ->That's right.</v>

234
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.619
<v Interviewer>40,000 years.</v>

235
00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:38.024
<v ->That's the power of the solar flare.</v>

236
00:10:38.024 --> 00:10:39.126
<v Interviewer>Meaning we should probably look at</v>

237
00:10:39.126 --> 00:10:40.601
a new kind of solar technology.

238
00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:43.004
Maybe just gathering heat and warmth from solar collectors

239
00:10:43.004 --> 00:10:44.044
isn't what it's about.

240
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.663
So on any of those levels,

241
00:10:45.663 --> 00:10:48.101
let's launch into what is the sun,

242
00:10:48.101 --> 00:10:50.806
and then what is the sun in relationship to the earth

243
00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:53.459
from what you have begun exploring.

244
00:10:54.034 --> 00:10:54.795
<v ->Okay, well we,</v>

245
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:56.344
in terms of the relationship to the earth,

246
00:10:56.344 --> 00:10:59.409
we have the James Lovelock's guide, for instance,

247
00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.129
which has introduced us to the notion

248
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.242
that the earth itself is a living system.

249
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.521
That everything is interacting together

250
00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:11.509
and working, as if you apply the criteria for a living being

251
00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:12.972
to what's going on on the earth,

252
00:11:13.024 --> 00:11:14.342
it would fit the bill.

253
00:11:14.859 --> 00:11:17.349
The sun is a million times bigger than the earth,

254
00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:19.555
huge hive of energy fields,

255
00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:22.620
and we're completely dependent on it.

256
00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:26.770
But it's not just this hot ball in the sky.

257
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.795
It's got seven very distinct levels to it,

258
00:11:30.184 --> 00:11:32.483
very different in lots of ways

259
00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:34.230
beyond just the temperature of them,

260
00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:36.169
and it starts off in the core.

261
00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:37.597
The core is an explosion,

262
00:11:38.113 --> 00:11:42.438
that it's a million tons of TNT,

263
00:11:44.058 --> 00:11:45.799
megatons of TNT a second,

264
00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:48.917
it's just every second, the energy coming out of the sun.

265
00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:51.750
So it's five million tons of the sun's energy,

266
00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:56.199
is being conver- matter, clip this,

267
00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:57.778
but five million tons of the sun's matter

268
00:11:57.778 --> 00:12:00.094
is being converted to energy every second.

269
00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:03.531
Now the amount of matter converted to energy at Hiroshima

270
00:12:03.943 --> 00:12:08.872
was the amount you get in a dime or an English 1p piece.

271
00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:11.437
That was the, this is 5 million tons a second,

272
00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.177
which would blow us all past Pluto.

273
00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.941
But around the core of the sun,

274
00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:19.913
the next layer is as thick as 25 earths,

275
00:12:20.626 --> 00:12:21.908
and that's a dense area,

276
00:12:21.927 --> 00:12:23.598
and that's the containment area

277
00:12:23.598 --> 00:12:25.184
that stops that from coming out.

278
00:12:25.433 --> 00:12:30.060
The next layer is 250,000 kilometers wide, convection zone.

279
00:12:30.158 --> 00:12:32.039
Here, you've got a whole different nature

280
00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:34.495
with these roiling bubbles of energy coming up,

281
00:12:34.582 --> 00:12:35.830
and you've got the photosphere,

282
00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:37.757
you've got the chromasphere beyond that,

283
00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:39.127
then interface layer,

284
00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:40.549
and then the corona.

285
00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:41.902
So there's all these different layers

286
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:43.771
doing different things.

287
00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:47.068
Inside the sun, some of the layers rotate

288
00:12:47.085 --> 00:12:48.775
at different speeds from each other,

289
00:12:49.454 --> 00:12:51.880
and this creates a, it's thought to create a dynamo effect

290
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.616
which could charge the sun's corona.

291
00:12:54.226 --> 00:12:56.524
And on the surface side of it, on the chromasphere,

292
00:12:56.524 --> 00:13:00.571
it's just this interlinked network of electromagnetic fields

293
00:13:01.273 --> 00:13:04.106
with their field lines all intertangled,

294
00:13:04.106 --> 00:13:06.353
and sometimes they move around on the surface,

295
00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:09.325
they're associated with solar flares.

296
00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:14.079
It's just such an energy device,

297
00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:17.069
and the corona takes up more space than the sun itself,

298
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.341
and that's one massive energy field that we know

299
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:22.287
very little about.

300
00:13:22.287 --> 00:13:25.230
It's described as the most mysterious aspect of the sun,

301
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.551
but the same scientists who describe it as mysterious

302
00:13:29.032 --> 00:13:31.244
say it controls the solar flares,

303
00:13:31.703 --> 00:13:34.054
the coronal mass ejections,

304
00:13:34.268 --> 00:13:36.260
the coronal filaments, and the sunspots.

305
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.779
They say this is all managed by the corona,

306
00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:40.868
but we don't know anything about the corona. (laughter)

307
00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:41.541
<v Interviewer>Mm-hmm.</v>

308
00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:45.349
It's almost like an interesting- a very complex system

309
00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:46.702
of checks and balances,

310
00:13:47.149 --> 00:13:51.265
so that it can feed and send through

311
00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:54.876
critical information, plus the light,

312
00:13:55.462 --> 00:14:00.379
without essentially frying everything in its sphere.

313
00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:05.593
<v ->Yeah, it's a very delicate, complex organism or machine,</v>

314
00:14:07.072 --> 00:14:08.407
or whatever you want to call it,

315
00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:11.896
and the idea that this just accidentally

316
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.923
coagulates out of a big cloud of cosmic dust,

317
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.066
because we know the mechanics of it,

318
00:14:22.246 --> 00:14:25.822
is the analogy I used earlier, to say the same thing is true

319
00:14:25.822 --> 00:14:26.326
of a human being.

320
00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:27.058
<v Interviewer>Of the human body.</v>

321
00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:29.467
<v ->However it forms and creates itself,</v>

322
00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:32.741
there's obviously life in there, a manifestation

323
00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:36.833
of the life force, or the consciousness if you like it,

324
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:38.314
that permeates the whole universe,

325
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.638
whether that's called qi or prana or Holy Spirit

326
00:14:42.638 --> 00:14:43.887
or orgone energy,

327
00:14:44.368 --> 00:14:47.857
you know, it's been long acknowledged that there is

328
00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:50.446
an energy field that permeates everything.

329
00:14:50.951 --> 00:14:52.983
<v Interviewer>Yes, and we would certainly have to assume</v>

330
00:14:52.983 --> 00:14:55.549
behind an energy field is the word intelligence, as well,

331
00:14:55.549 --> 00:14:56.530
which we can get to.

332
00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:58.039
Let's talk about the plasma,

333
00:14:58.381 --> 00:15:00.338
the fourth state called plasma in the sun.

334
00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:03.443
<v ->Mm-hmm, well this is the state of matter,</v>

335
00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:05.574
I mean, we're very familiar with solids

336
00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:07.583
and liquids and gases,

337
00:15:08.192 --> 00:15:11.379
and we forget,

338
00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:13.481
or we only really realized recently

339
00:15:13.765 --> 00:15:16.505
that 99 percent plus of the matter

340
00:15:16.505 --> 00:15:17.985
in the universe is plasma.

341
00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:21.689
And this is where you don't have that perfect balance

342
00:15:22.205 --> 00:15:25.300
of protons and electrons in the atom,

343
00:15:25.351 --> 00:15:27.227
you've got one more or less electron,

344
00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:30.303
and this makes it really conducive to

345
00:15:30.715 --> 00:15:32.173
the electromagnetic force,

346
00:15:32.457 --> 00:15:35.110
so electromagnetic energy charges through that,

347
00:15:35.557 --> 00:15:39.139
as demonstrated on earth where the most common plasma

348
00:15:39.492 --> 00:15:41.043
example we have on earth is lightning,

349
00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:43.678
and the air is turned to plasma,

350
00:15:44.461 --> 00:15:48.473
at which point, vroom, the charge can come down on it.

351
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.750
And you see those plasma bowls

352
00:15:49.802 --> 00:15:52.722
where the plasma follows your fingers,

353
00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:53.558
which is great.

354
00:15:55.015 --> 00:15:59.740
And that's what the sun and all stars are is plasma,

355
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.955
so the matter inside them is not fixed,

356
00:16:03.955 --> 00:16:06.167
it's fluid, even though it's not liquid,

357
00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:10.799
it moves, even where it's 15 times the density of gold

358
00:16:11.188 --> 00:16:12.575
in the core of the sun,

359
00:16:13.463 --> 00:16:17.364
it is still moving, and the electromagnetic force

360
00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:18.572
is charging through it.

361
00:16:18.572 --> 00:16:21.193
We don't really know much about the electromagnetic force,

362
00:16:21.193 --> 00:16:23.892
'cause you can't weigh it or measure it

363
00:16:24.037 --> 00:16:25.320
or take samples of it.

364
00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:29.163
But it is what keeps us alive.

365
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:33.366
Our life force, if you take that energy away,

366
00:16:33.476 --> 00:16:35.131
you know, we're just wormfood.

367
00:16:36.657 --> 00:16:38.799
That is what makes the difference, and--

368
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.256
<v Interviewer>It's a delicate,</v>

369
00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:42.021
seems like a very delicate dance between

370
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:46.026
the photonic types of energies coming in

371
00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:48.912
and the mineral balances in the body,

372
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.315
and whatever that dance is in between,

373
00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:53.741
and the electromagnetic charges

374
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:56.306
within, seems to essentially without it,

375
00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:57.160
everything dies.

376
00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:58.019
<v ->Yeah.</v>

377
00:16:58.942 --> 00:17:02.791
So with us, the actual energy of our consciousness

378
00:17:02.843 --> 00:17:05.926
and our mind is the least understood.

379
00:17:06.012 --> 00:17:08.863
Our least understood aspect of our existence

380
00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:11.051
is what consciousness is.

381
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:12.816
Some scientists actually say consciousness

382
00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:14.843
is an illusion of the brain

383
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:19.278
and yet, whilst it's the least understood aspect of it,

384
00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:21.739
we think we know enough about consciousness

385
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.281
to know that nothing else can have it,

386
00:17:24.995 --> 00:17:29.140
that it can be only combined with these combination

387
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.851
of neurons and fingers and eyes and ears,

388
00:17:31.868 --> 00:17:33.453
and you need all this for consciousness.

389
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.162
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

390
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.830
<v ->Whereas perhaps all this is just a vehicle</v>

391
00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:40.628
through which our consciousness is expressed.

392
00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:43.513
And to look at the sun and say,

393
00:17:43.513 --> 00:17:44.669
"Well it's got all the energy,

394
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.037
"it's got all these energy fields, it's got this huge,"

395
00:17:47.553 --> 00:17:50.845
I mean, the heliosphere comes off of the corona

396
00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:54.073
as it spins, embraces the whole solar system,

397
00:17:54.392 --> 00:17:57.433
and stops it from being battered to pieces

398
00:17:57.433 --> 00:17:58.984
by cosmic rays,

399
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:03.256
and also creates these amazing exchanges at the poles

400
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:07.012
of all the planets called the auroras.

401
00:18:07.012 --> 00:18:08.655
We have these wonderful northern lights

402
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:12.235
and Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis,

403
00:18:12.677 --> 00:18:15.046
and these dancing curtains of light,

404
00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:17.838
and that's happening on Jupiter, on Saturn, on Uranus,

405
00:18:18.424 --> 00:18:21.170
where the sun's magnetic field

406
00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:24.444
meets the magnetic field of each of the planets.

407
00:18:25.193 --> 00:18:27.544
And again, we just see all this as, you know,

408
00:18:28.328 --> 00:18:32.246
accidental behavior, like avalanches falling off a mountain

409
00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:35.967
or wind from undigested food, you know, (laughter)

410
00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:36.623
and everything,

411
00:18:37.139 --> 00:18:39.113
yet we go to such incredible efforts

412
00:18:39.113 --> 00:18:40.687
to create energy ourselves,

413
00:18:41.342 --> 00:18:44.692
whether it's in power stations or batteries or fires,

414
00:18:44.802 --> 00:18:47.484
you know, we really work to create energy

415
00:18:47.484 --> 00:18:48.622
and do stuff with it,

416
00:18:48.622 --> 00:18:51.635
and yet we assume that all these other energetic phenomena

417
00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:55.071
happening in the universe are accidental

418
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:58.154
manifestations of nothing.

419
00:18:58.154 --> 00:18:58.931
<v Interviewer>It makes no sense.</v>

420
00:18:58.931 --> 00:19:02.072
There was that recent discovery about the magnetic openings?

421
00:19:02.368 --> 00:19:04.597
The magnetic openings between the sun and the earth

422
00:19:04.597 --> 00:19:05.451
that are occurring.

423
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.536
<v ->Oh, the magnetic portals.</v>

424
00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:07.674
<v Interviewer>Like the pulsation every eight--</v>

425
00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:08.370
<v ->Every eight minutes.</v>

426
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.171
<v Interviewer>Every eight minutes.</v>

427
00:19:09.171 --> 00:19:10.170
<v ->Yeah, tons of high energy particles</v>

428
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.003
pass between this magnetic portal

429
00:19:13.003 --> 00:19:14.233
joining the earth and the sun.

430
00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:15.493
It's amazing, isn't it?

431
00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:16.915
<v Interviewer>I was gonna say, accident?</v>

432
00:19:16.915 --> 00:19:18.698
(laughter)

433
00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:21.722
I mean, what's so interesting I find about this conversation

434
00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:24.706
is that even as we're having this conversation,

435
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.800
and you've given so much thought and research

436
00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:30.006
to the subject of the sun,

437
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.685
so much on certain levels still cannot be answered.

438
00:19:34.795 --> 00:19:36.594
We don't understand what the sun is,

439
00:19:36.594 --> 00:19:38.591
we don't understand the multidimensionality

440
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:40.850
of the earth, no less the sun,

441
00:19:41.134 --> 00:19:43.056
and again now, if you're talking photons,

442
00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:45.052
you're talking information.

443
00:19:45.244 --> 00:19:46.544
So let's talk about the sun

444
00:19:46.544 --> 00:19:48.431
as a source of information.

445
00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:51.728
<v ->Okay, well photons or light is,</v>

446
00:19:52.477 --> 00:19:55.931
we now know, it's the most efficient means

447
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.100
of conveying information, conceivable.

448
00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:02.769
So through optical cables,

449
00:20:03.344 --> 00:20:04.244
I mean they're now,

450
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.490
actually now this is five years ago I was reading

451
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.385
that we could now produce an optical cable

452
00:20:10.983 --> 00:20:13.590
capable of carrying all the internet traffic on the planet

453
00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:14.751
through one cable,

454
00:20:15.023 --> 00:20:18.309
because light, it doesn't have substance,

455
00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:19.615
so you can compress it,

456
00:20:20.236 --> 00:20:24.886
and it's this incredible conveyor of information,

457
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.533
and you know we have beings of light,

458
00:20:28.247 --> 00:20:29.635
we could talk about beings of light,

459
00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:33.710
we don't talk about beings of concrete or mud or--

460
00:20:34.284 --> 00:20:35.352
<v Interviewer>(laughter) Right.</v>

461
00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:37.288
When we go into our highest potential,

462
00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:38.339
it's always a being of light.

463
00:20:38.925 --> 00:20:40.847
<v ->And it is, it is the huge,</v>

464
00:20:41.026 --> 00:20:42.577
of course and also we see light,

465
00:20:43.128 --> 00:20:45.299
physicists see light as embracing

466
00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:47.047
the whole electromagnetic spectrum.

467
00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:49.641
I mean, what we see as visilble light is just

468
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:52.910
a tiny, tiny fraction of all those vibrations

469
00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:54.489
that are out there, and they're all photons

470
00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:57.449
vibrating at different levels,

471
00:20:58.012 --> 00:20:59.922
and we don't really know what a photon is.

472
00:21:01.378 --> 00:21:03.765
I have a little bit in my book about

473
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:07.927
the history of scientists trying to discover

474
00:21:07.927 --> 00:21:09.744
whether a photon is a particle or a wave,

475
00:21:10.794 --> 00:21:12.095
and it all gets very confusing,

476
00:21:12.095 --> 00:21:12.896
and afterwards I said,

477
00:21:12.896 --> 00:21:15.102
well if you get confused by this, don't worry,

478
00:21:15.102 --> 00:21:17.052
so are the scientists for centuries!

479
00:21:17.052 --> 00:21:18.579
(laughter)

480
00:21:18.596 --> 00:21:19.346
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

481
00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:22.056
But nonetheless, this is the most efficient way

482
00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:23.867
to convey information, and we are being

483
00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:26.607
literally bombarded.

484
00:21:26.607 --> 00:21:27.475
<v ->Yeah, drenched in it.</v>

485
00:21:27.475 --> 00:21:28.526
<v Interviewer>Drenched in it.</v>

486
00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:29.077
<v ->Yeah.</v>

487
00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.343
Bombarded is what the people who are trying

488
00:21:30.343 --> 00:21:31.643
to get us frightened of it would say.

489
00:21:31.643 --> 00:21:33.082
<v Interviewer>That's, no, not bombarded, drenched</v>

490
00:21:33.082 --> 00:21:34.493
in a glorious way.

491
00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:39.068
And so, I mean, do you have any,

492
00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:41.042
we're going a little esoteric here

493
00:21:41.093 --> 00:21:42.040
and off the track for a bit,

494
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:46.248
but what do you suppose we're being drenched in

495
00:21:46.248 --> 00:21:47.381
by way of information?

496
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.090
I mean, we're having to assume that information

497
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.347
is being passed to us, not just light and heat,

498
00:21:54.433 --> 00:21:56.569
information is being passed to all living systems

499
00:21:56.569 --> 00:21:57.818
on this planet.

500
00:21:57.974 --> 00:21:59.611
The plants, the animals, us.

501
00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:03.744
<v ->Well this is where we need to reeducate ourselves,</v>

502
00:22:03.744 --> 00:22:08.354
because our ancestors knew a lot about this,

503
00:22:08.354 --> 00:22:10.659
and they built great monuments,

504
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.089
which were not just designed to say,

505
00:22:14.089 --> 00:22:16.603
"Oh, sun, you are great, I'm gonna put all this,

506
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:19.378
"move all these stones and put them in place."

507
00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:22.211
These were information channels,

508
00:22:22.796 --> 00:22:26.053
ways of receiving different types of information

509
00:22:26.663 --> 00:22:28.492
from the sun and stars,

510
00:22:28.636 --> 00:22:33.636
and in India, there's more knowledge of this retained,

511
00:22:33.872 --> 00:22:37.594
and there's the sun salutation yoga exercise,

512
00:22:37.611 --> 00:22:39.834
which is done every morning by millions of Hindus,

513
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.598
which is at sunrise, a particular way

514
00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:46.603
of pulling those vibrations as energies into yourself.

515
00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:48.205
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

516
00:22:48.292 --> 00:22:50.365
<v ->I was once doing, in India,</v>

517
00:22:50.626 --> 00:22:52.095
in the morning,

518
00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:54.811
it was a very strong Jupiter,

519
00:22:55.467 --> 00:22:57.586
and Jupiter's my, one of my planets

520
00:22:57.696 --> 00:22:58.573
in my horoscope,

521
00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:01.580
and I was just staring at Jupiter,

522
00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:05.407
meditating on it, and this woman came up to me,

523
00:23:05.407 --> 00:23:06.957
it's a very bizarre moment,

524
00:23:07.207 --> 00:23:08.931
and she saw what I was doing,

525
00:23:09.505 --> 00:23:13.917
and she said, "Oh, when we're receiving the energies

526
00:23:13.917 --> 00:23:17.371
"from Jupiter, we hold our tongue in this particular way

527
00:23:18.085 --> 00:23:19.299
"as we're breathing in,"

528
00:23:19.316 --> 00:23:20.686
and I thought, wow!
<v Interviewer>Interesting.</v>

529
00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:21.452
Yes.

530
00:23:22.323 --> 00:23:23.461
<v ->Somebody who's into it more than me</v>

531
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:26.079
picked up what I was doing and told me how to do it better,

532
00:23:26.131 --> 00:23:28.018
but there's all this sort of type,

533
00:23:28.395 --> 00:23:32.064
so it's like, nothing to do with the sun, really,

534
00:23:32.064 --> 00:23:34.090
but when the tsunami hit,

535
00:23:34.734 --> 00:23:37.851
there was this group of aboriginal islanders

536
00:23:38.612 --> 00:23:39.930
who when people got to the island,

537
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:42.321
everybody assumed they would be dead.

538
00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:43.900
And they hadn't.

539
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.836
They had know, that the tsunami was coming.

540
00:23:48.654 --> 00:23:50.047
People asked them and they said,

541
00:23:50.047 --> 00:23:50.971
"We listened to the birds."

542
00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.149
<v Interviewer>Mm-hmm.</v>

543
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.950
<v ->"We heard it from the birds,"</v>

544
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.950
and it's just this lost connection with our world,

545
00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.771
whether it's the sun,

546
00:23:59.893 --> 00:24:01.797
and my book isn't really just about the sun,

547
00:24:01.797 --> 00:24:04.682
I really use that as a anchor point,

548
00:24:05.268 --> 00:24:08.421
because I think it's really very clear,

549
00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:10.771
I make it very clear that the sun is a living being,

550
00:24:10.771 --> 00:24:12.461
and our important connection with it,

551
00:24:12.977 --> 00:24:16.861
but it makes the, it opens the ground up

552
00:24:16.878 --> 00:24:21.296
to be aware of how we need to connect with the oceans,

553
00:24:21.383 --> 00:24:23.897
with the trees, with the winds, with the mountains,

554
00:24:23.914 --> 00:24:26.900
with all the other aspects of this living world,

555
00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:28.142
this living universe

556
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.279
that we're a very small part of.

557
00:24:30.992 --> 00:24:33.344
<v Interviewer>Yes, and you were talking a moment ago about</v>

558
00:24:33.396 --> 00:24:37.262
some of the Hindus, millions of Hindus who understand

559
00:24:37.262 --> 00:24:39.665
and appreciate and use this yogic expression

560
00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:40.913
of the sun salutation,

561
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.086
and also it's known,

562
00:24:42.475 --> 00:24:43.886
I did a little research recently

563
00:24:44.641 --> 00:24:47.422
about the sun's effect in sun gazing,

564
00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:50.945
and the effect of sun gazing on all of the master glands,

565
00:24:50.945 --> 00:24:54.381
and our master glands seems to be seriously compromised

566
00:24:54.381 --> 00:24:55.769
as a species right now.

567
00:24:55.879 --> 00:24:58.352
We're talking about the pineal and the hypothalamus

568
00:24:58.352 --> 00:24:59.635
and the pituitary glands.

569
00:24:59.826 --> 00:25:02.125
All of these are the controllers

570
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:05.225
of all of the systems, the endocrine system

571
00:25:05.225 --> 00:25:07.275
and all the hormonal functions of the body,

572
00:25:07.501 --> 00:25:11.727
and this is very much governed by our connection to,

573
00:25:11.727 --> 00:25:13.788
or lack of connection with sunlight,

574
00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:17.457
and specifically, taking sunlight in through the eyes.

575
00:25:18.507 --> 00:25:19.686
<v ->Yes, I had,</v>

576
00:25:20.446 --> 00:25:23.227
I discovered so much through writing this book,

577
00:25:24.045 --> 00:25:28.248
and after writing it, and one of the things I discovered

578
00:25:28.248 --> 00:25:31.046
was sun gazing, after I finished the book.

579
00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:32.926
<v Interviewer>Yes, after you'd finished it.</v>

580
00:25:32.926 --> 00:25:34.303
<v ->I've got a chapter called "Say Hello Back,"</v>

581
00:25:34.656 --> 00:25:37.187
which is the responding, sending vibrations back

582
00:25:37.187 --> 00:25:38.929
with your eyes closed, facing it,

583
00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:40.015
which is a good technique.

584
00:25:40.566 --> 00:25:43.689
But then I went to a lecture from this HRM man,

585
00:25:43.689 --> 00:25:44.775
who travels the world doing it,

586
00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:48.722
and actually found out about sun gazing,

587
00:25:48.867 --> 00:25:50.150
and I've sort of been in,

588
00:25:50.562 --> 00:25:52.391
which I did once when I was 18,

589
00:25:52.942 --> 00:25:54.028
but I'd never done since.

590
00:25:54.707 --> 00:25:57.447
And then I've since built my abilities up,

591
00:25:57.447 --> 00:25:59.653
so I do do sungazing,

592
00:25:59.653 --> 00:26:01.900
sometimes in puddles, sometimes through trees,

593
00:26:01.917 --> 00:26:03.130
sometimes directly at the sun,

594
00:26:03.287 --> 00:26:06.706
and yeah, it's a really powerful, powerful charge.

595
00:26:06.886 --> 00:26:09.075
It's like having a wonderful shiatsu massage.

596
00:26:09.556 --> 00:26:10.729
<v Interviewer>It is, and in fact,</v>

597
00:26:10.729 --> 00:26:12.656
something's just coming back into my memory

598
00:26:12.656 --> 00:26:13.777
I had forgotten all about,

599
00:26:13.852 --> 00:26:15.982
and this would have been from about 25 years ago.

600
00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:21.534
I used to see a woman who was famous in our town

601
00:26:21.572 --> 00:26:23.157
as a healer.

602
00:26:23.407 --> 00:26:25.421
She wore a little starchy white nurse's uniform,

603
00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:27.400
and she was stern, and she was a nurse,

604
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.195
but she could see and heal,

605
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:30.762
and she did it through reflexology.

606
00:26:31.209 --> 00:26:32.938
And she was in her 80's at this time,

607
00:26:32.938 --> 00:26:34.431
and her name was Mrs. Whipple.

608
00:26:34.877 --> 00:26:35.789
<v ->Oh, right!</v>

609
00:26:35.818 --> 00:26:38.506
<v Interviewer>Yes, and Mrs. Whipple told me one day,</v>

610
00:26:39.057 --> 00:26:42.337
she said, "Dear, you need to go into the sun in the morning,

611
00:26:42.551 --> 00:26:44.880
"and you bring the sun into the solar plexus,

612
00:26:45.094 --> 00:26:48.432
"and allow the sun, once it comes into the solar plexus

613
00:26:48.832 --> 00:26:51.277
"to split into its rays,

614
00:26:51.329 --> 00:26:52.629
"and you can take it up through the chakras

615
00:26:52.629 --> 00:26:55.090
"in its color forms, you know, from indigo down to red,

616
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.933
"but absorb it, and be appreciative of it."

617
00:26:58.933 --> 00:27:03.630
So one day shortly after that, I did that one morning.

618
00:27:03.682 --> 00:27:05.249
I went out and did that, just to see what

619
00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:06.718
Mrs. Whipple was up to,

620
00:27:07.838 --> 00:27:11.060
and I had this overwhelming urge to start running.

621
00:27:11.217 --> 00:27:13.266
And I hadn't been running for quite a long time,

622
00:27:13.388 --> 00:27:15.878
and I was a runner prior to that, but years,

623
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.608
and I couldn't stop.

624
00:27:18.055 --> 00:27:20.696
I was so brimming with energy,

625
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.914
I just ran!

626
00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:26.014
I ran at least a couple miles before I stopped

627
00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:27.354
and headed back home and thought,

628
00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:28.649
"Where is this coming from?"

629
00:27:29.142 --> 00:27:31.801
And I had, until you just said that,

630
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:33.740
I had completely forgotten about this experience.

631
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.056
I was supercharged from the sun,

632
00:27:36.073 --> 00:27:37.798
and that was taking in in the solar plexus,

633
00:27:37.885 --> 00:27:39.690
rather than through sun gazing.

634
00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:40.836
<v ->Yeah.</v>

635
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.369
Well, it's solar energy,

636
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:44.685
it's a different application of solar energy

637
00:27:44.685 --> 00:27:46.107
that we forget about, yeah.

638
00:27:46.217 --> 00:27:47.053
<v Interviewer>And the thing is,</v>

639
00:27:47.053 --> 00:27:48.423
we could sit here and share stories,

640
00:27:48.423 --> 00:27:49.259
swap stories and say,

641
00:27:49.259 --> 00:27:50.594
"Oh yeah, and I remember that time,"

642
00:27:50.594 --> 00:27:54.107
but there's something really larger that we need to

643
00:27:55.563 --> 00:28:00.353
consider here, in terms of using,

644
00:28:00.939 --> 00:28:04.410
remembering the sun in a way that becomes integrated

645
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.372
back into human consciousness

646
00:28:06.372 --> 00:28:08.364
on a very conscious level,

647
00:28:08.404 --> 00:28:10.291
to make that choice,

648
00:28:10.807 --> 00:28:12.583
and one of the things,

649
00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:14.348
you said consciousness, again,

650
00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:15.457
using the word consciousness,

651
00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:17.018
as you point out in the book,

652
00:28:17.018 --> 00:28:19.724
consciousness is the building block of all matter.

653
00:28:19.724 --> 00:28:21.239
We look at this material universe,

654
00:28:21.488 --> 00:28:25.598
and again, it has to be, the formation of the earth itself,

655
00:28:25.598 --> 00:28:27.398
you write about the formation of the earth itself,

656
00:28:27.398 --> 00:28:30.393
and what you think that may be in regards to the sun,

657
00:28:30.393 --> 00:28:31.723
if you care to go into that now.

658
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:34.382
<v ->Well it was a way maybe,</v>

659
00:28:34.631 --> 00:28:37.458
but I see the planets as,

660
00:28:38.439 --> 00:28:40.187
I don't really know what their function is to the sun,

661
00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:41.510
but I'm sure there is a function,

662
00:28:42.073 --> 00:28:44.297
whether it's a garden or a playground

663
00:28:44.546 --> 00:28:49.120
or what part Jupiter and the earth and Saturn

664
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.763
play in the sun.

665
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.920
There's obviously a symbiotic relationship between them.

666
00:29:01.415 --> 00:29:04.097
And we're formed, these planets were formed

667
00:29:04.097 --> 00:29:06.732
out of the afterbirth from the sun,

668
00:29:06.732 --> 00:29:09.885
so after the sun is formed from a cloud of gas,

669
00:29:10.668 --> 00:29:12.787
the planets, the various planets are formed,

670
00:29:13.536 --> 00:29:18.536
and on this planet, all the energy of life,

671
00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:23.323
I mean every single bit of the energy we have

672
00:29:23.323 --> 00:29:24.931
is recycled sunlight,

673
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.610
and all of the matter that we are made of

674
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.212
and that the planets are made of

675
00:29:32.031 --> 00:29:33.442
is recycled stardust,

676
00:29:33.726 --> 00:29:36.164
because we started off with hydrogen and a little bit

677
00:29:36.164 --> 00:29:36.901
of helium,

678
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.007
and it's on stars, which are the transmutation machines

679
00:29:40.007 --> 00:29:41.692
of the cosmos,

680
00:29:41.934 --> 00:29:45.110
that all the other elements were brought into being

681
00:29:45.208 --> 00:29:50.208
that make possible planets and the energy of life,

682
00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:56.175
and it's this incredible kind of evolution of matter

683
00:29:56.284 --> 00:29:59.490
from hydrogen that takes place, that stars are doing

684
00:30:00.121 --> 00:30:04.509
and what is the purpose of having all of this?

685
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:07.778
In a sense, we're all energy being recycled.

686
00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:13.670
If you take the Einstein's equivalence of e=mc squared,

687
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.305
showing that matter and energy are different manifestations

688
00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:17.286
of the same thing,

689
00:30:17.872 --> 00:30:20.403
well the beginning, the matter side of it

690
00:30:20.403 --> 00:30:22.163
was just hydrogen and helium.

691
00:30:22.981 --> 00:30:27.132
Now, if you were looking, almost as if energy

692
00:30:27.276 --> 00:30:29.628
and that intelligence and consciousness of energy

693
00:30:30.086 --> 00:30:32.542
is experiencing different existences,

694
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:35.270
I'm one of the existences it's experiencing,

695
00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:38.370
this aloe vera plant is another one,

696
00:30:38.585 --> 00:30:40.256
trees are another, wind.

697
00:30:40.256 --> 00:30:45.256
They're all different experiences of existence.

698
00:30:46.236 --> 00:30:49.103
And in this type of an experience,

699
00:30:49.103 --> 00:30:50.282
we're taking in,

700
00:30:51.704 --> 00:30:55.530
we're energy which has been reformulated as matter,

701
00:30:56.209 --> 00:30:59.593
which is taking in energy from the sun

702
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.670
and reformulating that as the energy of life.

703
00:31:03.453 --> 00:31:08.453
So, there's the sort of transition, transmutation

704
00:31:08.852 --> 00:31:11.505
from energy to matter to energy to matter

705
00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:14.582
which is going on, and I find it really interesting,

706
00:31:14.726 --> 00:31:16.346
the little bit of it I play,

707
00:31:16.468 --> 00:31:19.179
and I'm sure the tree finds its bit interesting,

708
00:31:19.696 --> 00:31:23.022
and a tornado or a thundercloud or a weather system

709
00:31:23.167 --> 00:31:24.648
finds its part interesting,

710
00:31:24.804 --> 00:31:29.593
and it's just all going, and we see,

711
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:35.911
we understand that life somehow imbues intelligence,

712
00:31:36.878 --> 00:31:40.083
entails intelligence within it,

713
00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:43.270
and we see how incredibly intelligent plants are

714
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:45.081
at mimicking,

715
00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:50.352
they'll send out scents that attracts the predators,

716
00:31:50.392 --> 00:31:52.772
or something that's attacking them,

717
00:31:52.772 --> 00:31:55.983
these incredible intelligence manifested,

718
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:59.309
and yet, when we see inanimate,

719
00:31:59.309 --> 00:32:02.728
what we class inanimate objects, like the ocean,

720
00:32:03.349 --> 00:32:05.950
creating these huge currents of the gulf stream,

721
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.248
I mean there're currents connecting all the oceans,

722
00:32:08.248 --> 00:32:10.867
they run on the surface, they run below the ground,

723
00:32:11.418 --> 00:32:12.486
they're very functional,

724
00:32:12.486 --> 00:32:17.486
they manage, part manage the world's climate systems,

725
00:32:19.893 --> 00:32:22.976
and yet we assume this is all accidental somehow,

726
00:32:23.794 --> 00:32:26.697
it's just nothing but natural forces creating

727
00:32:26.697 --> 00:32:27.869
these very defined currents

728
00:32:27.869 --> 00:32:29.599
doing these very defined things,

729
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:33.639
'cause we can't allow ourselves to think that all these

730
00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:34.673
water molecules--
<v Interviewer>Anything other than</v>

731
00:32:34.673 --> 00:32:35.706
ourselves has intelligence.

732
00:32:35.706 --> 00:32:38.307
<v ->'Cause it has, and our intelligence, our brain</v>

733
00:32:38.307 --> 00:32:40.925
is filled with hundreds of billions of neurons

734
00:32:42.022 --> 00:32:43.543
that are all acting independently.

735
00:32:43.543 --> 00:32:45.180
Nobody's controlling or managing them,

736
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.094
but they're creating this intelligence organization

737
00:32:48.094 --> 00:32:49.110
from the bottom up.

738
00:32:49.754 --> 00:32:52.907
In the oceans, you've got all these sort of water molecules,

739
00:32:52.958 --> 00:32:56.894
and yet we cannot imagine that intelligence

740
00:32:56.894 --> 00:32:59.385
from the bottom up is manifesting there.

741
00:32:59.832 --> 00:33:01.753
We don't even really see it in the termite mound,

742
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.001
even though the termite mound's

743
00:33:03.001 --> 00:33:05.654
got this fabulous bunch of architecture

744
00:33:05.869 --> 00:33:09.212
and ventilation, perfect ventilation inside,

745
00:33:09.212 --> 00:33:10.264
how are they doing it?

746
00:33:11.047 --> 00:33:15.128
There's this- it's only really when you come to humans

747
00:33:15.644 --> 00:33:17.996
that you get top-down control,

748
00:33:18.524 --> 00:33:20.822
and this is all the governments of the world saying,

749
00:33:20.822 --> 00:33:22.860
"This is what a house is gonna be,

750
00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:26.367
"this is how much you get paid for your work,

751
00:33:26.825 --> 00:33:28.659
"these are all sort of the musts,"

752
00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:30.546
and they're trying to micromanage

753
00:33:31.527 --> 00:33:34.656
this whole chaotic system called humanity,

754
00:33:35.602 --> 00:33:37.884
and the more they get involved,

755
00:33:38.075 --> 00:33:39.201
the more of a mess we have,

756
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:40.745
and then they say, "We need more controls,

757
00:33:40.745 --> 00:33:42.423
"we need more top-down management."

758
00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:44.217
But when you look out at nature,

759
00:33:44.217 --> 00:33:46.336
it's all bottom-up.

760
00:33:46.713 --> 00:33:48.686
<v Interviewer>Yes, I mean you would say</v>

761
00:33:48.686 --> 00:33:50.381
nature is very intuitive.

762
00:33:50.381 --> 00:33:52.715
We're probably the least intuitive thing on the planet

763
00:33:52.715 --> 00:33:53.743
as human beings.

764
00:33:53.853 --> 00:33:54.422
<v ->Yeah.</v>

765
00:33:54.422 --> 00:33:55.513
<v Interviewer>Because we've allowed this</v>

766
00:33:55.513 --> 00:33:57.324
conscious part of the mind,

767
00:33:57.324 --> 00:33:58.677
the animalistic part of the mind,

768
00:33:59.124 --> 00:34:00.976
that's based sheerly for survival

769
00:34:01.132 --> 00:34:04.534
to become a little too sophisticated for its own good

770
00:34:04.534 --> 00:34:07.065
on one level, while suppressing the greater mind

771
00:34:07.065 --> 00:34:09.289
which is the intuitive aspect.

772
00:34:09.306 --> 00:34:11.663
<v ->Absolutely, I mean they're both, we need a balance.</v>

773
00:34:11.663 --> 00:34:12.690
<v Interviewer>We need a balance, yes.</v>

774
00:34:12.707 --> 00:34:15.006
<v ->Certainly I don't want the person designing my airplane</v>

775
00:34:15.006 --> 00:34:18.600
to be totally intuitive, you know, trial and error.

776
00:34:19.174 --> 00:34:20.219
<v Interviewer>No, I understand what you're saying,</v>

777
00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.146
but still, that permeates the consciousness

778
00:34:22.146 --> 00:34:24.248
and intelligence that permeates all things,

779
00:34:24.248 --> 00:34:26.012
and so let's look at what might be

780
00:34:26.012 --> 00:34:28.677
say beyond the sun even.

781
00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:31.812
I mean, you write about dark matter in your book,

782
00:34:31.957 --> 00:34:35.411
that this is, plays a major role in the

783
00:34:36.032 --> 00:34:39.294
intelligence consciousness as the architect

784
00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:42.122
of everything that takes form within the universe.

785
00:34:42.336 --> 00:34:44.014
<v ->Oh, you think black holes or dark matter?</v>

786
00:34:44.043 --> 00:34:44.844
<v Interviewer>Dark matter.</v>

787
00:34:44.844 --> 00:34:48.890
<v ->'Cause I don't really talk about dark matter a lot,</v>

788
00:34:49.314 --> 00:34:54.314
because I see dark matter as a construct

789
00:34:54.852 --> 00:34:57.487
to ignore what is there.

790
00:34:57.487 --> 00:34:59.537
<v Interviewer>Yes, okay, black holes.</v>

791
00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:02.085
<v ->Well, let's stick with dark matter for a minute,</v>

792
00:35:02.085 --> 00:35:07.085
because dark matter was created to explain why

793
00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.404
galaxies don't fall apart.

794
00:35:12.324 --> 00:35:13.799
'Cause it's all this assumption that they've got to be

795
00:35:13.799 --> 00:35:16.771
held in by the gravitational attraction

796
00:35:16.771 --> 00:35:18.908
that's holding them in, so the stars on the outer side

797
00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:23.737
of a galaxy shouldn't be moving at the same speed as

798
00:35:23.737 --> 00:35:26.066
the stars at the inside of a galaxy,

799
00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:28.364
'cause all stars are moving, they're in motion,

800
00:35:28.544 --> 00:35:30.698
they travel in pairs and most of them are paired out,

801
00:35:30.819 --> 00:35:35.667
and there's no sort of physical way of explaining

802
00:35:35.789 --> 00:35:37.855
how the galaxy doesn't fall apart.

803
00:35:37.855 --> 00:35:40.148
So they say, "Well there must be all this dark matter.

804
00:35:40.491 --> 00:35:42.395
"We can't see it, we can't detect it, there's no

805
00:35:42.395 --> 00:35:45.901
"evidence for it, but if there wasn't something there,

806
00:35:46.468 --> 00:35:49.742
"all these stars, all these dumb, unintelligent matter

807
00:35:49.742 --> 00:35:51.594
"would just fly out, fly apart."

808
00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:54.340
And I say the reason galaxies don't fall apart

809
00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.527
is 'cause they're not stupid!

810
00:35:55.707 --> 00:35:56.415
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

811
00:35:56.415 --> 00:35:57.489
<v ->And it's as simple as that.</v>

812
00:35:58.006 --> 00:36:00.339
You don't, there's consciousness there.

813
00:36:00.339 --> 00:36:03.039
You don't need that to create some completely

814
00:36:03.718 --> 00:36:06.603
ridiculous construct to explain them.

815
00:36:07.758 --> 00:36:08.617
Black holes I love.

816
00:36:08.617 --> 00:36:09.935
I don't know quite what's going on.

817
00:36:09.952 --> 00:36:12.925
Black holes, they're not really a mystical,

818
00:36:12.925 --> 00:36:14.150
esoteric concept.

819
00:36:14.747 --> 00:36:18.585
They are matter, just compressed so, so tight

820
00:36:19.298 --> 00:36:21.046
that the light doesn't escape from them

821
00:36:21.098 --> 00:36:22.131
and we can't see them.

822
00:36:22.131 --> 00:36:23.869
I say they're just that, that's a pretty amazing star

823
00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:27.695
from what's coming out of the other side of a black hole,

824
00:36:27.712 --> 00:36:30.122
if there is another side, I don't know.

825
00:36:30.301 --> 00:36:33.268
I did write a whole chapter about black holes,

826
00:36:33.378 --> 00:36:35.903
and I don't really know enough,

827
00:36:35.903 --> 00:36:38.452
I'm going off on my outer reaches of my mind,

828
00:36:38.452 --> 00:36:41.198
and I dropped that after a while,

829
00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:42.638
but I do think they're fascinating,

830
00:36:43.525 --> 00:36:46.144
and there's a lot to them, but...

831
00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:50.312
<v Interviewer>Well one of the things you write in the book</v>

832
00:36:50.317 --> 00:36:53.464
is even starting back in, if you want to go back to

833
00:36:53.464 --> 00:36:56.203
Biblical times and references even in Genesis,

834
00:36:56.203 --> 00:36:57.185
"Let there be light."

835
00:36:57.643 --> 00:37:00.656
So the light is preceding all else.

836
00:37:00.778 --> 00:37:02.949
<v ->Yeah, it's well represented as that.</v>

837
00:37:02.949 --> 00:37:05.666
Been most of the, well not most of Christianity,

838
00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:09.503
Judaism and Islam all drew heavily on Zoroastrianism.

839
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.748
Zoroastrianism was the first to come out with

840
00:37:13.478 --> 00:37:17.142
the good and bad concepts and heaven and hell,

841
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.149
but they had an in between place for the undecided people,

842
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:23.336
so if it was just whatever tipped you one way or the other,

843
00:37:23.336 --> 00:37:24.979
you could go in the middle for a while.

844
00:37:26.373 --> 00:37:27.870
But they had a god of light.

845
00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:32.317
The prime god of Zoroastrianism was Ahura Maz-

846
00:37:32.438 --> 00:37:36.624
or still is Ahura Mazda, the god of light.

847
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.104
And that was their god, was light itself,

848
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.655
and the sun and many other deities existed

849
00:37:47.055 --> 00:37:49.976
as lesser entities.

850
00:37:50.492 --> 00:37:51.989
Fire, where they worshiped fire,

851
00:37:51.989 --> 00:37:54.573
but that's 'cause fire was a manifestation of light,

852
00:37:54.927 --> 00:37:57.719
and this was picked up in Christianity

853
00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:01.974
by a god of light, but light itself

854
00:38:01.974 --> 00:38:04.099
doesn't have any standing and the sun

855
00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:05.359
doesn't have any standing,

856
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:09.509
but there's this sort of ephemerous spiritual light

857
00:38:09.509 --> 00:38:12.980
that we don't see, we don't really aware of

858
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.693
unless you're in some high mystical place,

859
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:18.553
but yeah, light, pure vibration is at the beginning

860
00:38:18.553 --> 00:38:22.686
of it all, and to my mind, that was the beginning,

861
00:38:23.326 --> 00:38:26.675
the first force was energy,

862
00:38:26.692 --> 00:38:28.195
and it's very hard to get our heads around,

863
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.751
but energy doesn't need a place to be,

864
00:38:34.264 --> 00:38:35.738
because it's just a vibration.

865
00:38:35.738 --> 00:38:37.788
It doesn't have to be some place.

866
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:39.959
And as just a vibration,

867
00:38:40.011 --> 00:38:41.422
it doesn't experience time.

868
00:38:41.938 --> 00:38:46.938
So what was there before the Big Bang,

869
00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.758
before all this came into being?

870
00:38:51.714 --> 00:38:54.866
If you look at before, outside the sense of time,

871
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:56.143
you could have vibration.

872
00:38:57.484 --> 00:39:01.275
And that vibration would have been,

873
00:39:01.896 --> 00:39:03.179
could have been the very beginning,

874
00:39:03.393 --> 00:39:06.064
and if you look at what came first, matter or energy,

875
00:39:06.064 --> 00:39:08.287
energy is the only possible candidate,

876
00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:10.284
'cause energy could have come first,

877
00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:12.757
and then condensed into matter.

878
00:39:13.146 --> 00:39:15.445
Maybe it was a big whoosh instead of a big bang,

879
00:39:16.334 --> 00:39:19.800
or a big bang is when you turn matter into energy

880
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:20.961
in a nuclear bomb,

881
00:39:21.419 --> 00:39:23.504
but if you turn energy into matter,

882
00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:25.018
maybe it's (whoosh).

883
00:39:25.018 --> 00:39:26.534
<v Interviewer>It's something, yes exactly.</v>

884
00:39:27.826 --> 00:39:29.109
And intelligently directed.

885
00:39:30.287 --> 00:39:30.926
<v ->Yes.</v>

886
00:39:30.926 --> 00:39:31.657
<v Interviewer>Self-organizing.</v>

887
00:39:31.657 --> 00:39:34.165
<v ->Self-organizing the intelligence of that--</v>

888
00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:35.344
<v Interviewer>Big Bang doesn't feel right.</v>

889
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:37.128
<v ->What?</v>

890
00:39:37.128 --> 00:39:38.231
<v Interviewer>Big Bang doesn't feel right,</v>

891
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:39.520
never has to me.
<v ->No, Big Bang doesn't feel right.</v>

892
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.486
And David Bohm, when we created this plasma,

893
00:39:42.666 --> 00:39:44.959
a plasma of electrons,

894
00:39:45.336 --> 00:39:49.127
in his famous Lawrence Livermore laboratory experiment,

895
00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:53.493
he saw that these pure electrons were self organizing

896
00:39:53.986 --> 00:39:57.231
to perform tasks, acting as if they were living beings.

897
00:39:57.956 --> 00:40:01.306
And energy has this capacity to it,

898
00:40:01.323 --> 00:40:04.226
and that takes my sort of reproductive thing back,

899
00:40:04.226 --> 00:40:05.880
'cause if it did start with pure energy,

900
00:40:06.222 --> 00:40:09.874
the first thing that energy does with the matter it creates

901
00:40:10.565 --> 00:40:14.054
is form these big bowls of hydrogen and helium,

902
00:40:14.338 --> 00:40:16.445
and what do they do? They create more energy.

903
00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:19.290
With matter, energy creates matter,

904
00:40:19.644 --> 00:40:21.925
and then that matter self-assembles to create energy,

905
00:40:22.476 --> 00:40:25.768
and energy creates more different types of matter,

906
00:40:25.878 --> 00:40:26.999
us being one of those,

907
00:40:27.178 --> 00:40:30.371
then we create, we take in sunlight and use that energy.

908
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:32.293
It's just great sort of,

909
00:40:32.322 --> 00:40:34.353
and it's much more exciting than just being energy,

910
00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:35.155
I suppose!

911
00:40:35.155 --> 00:40:36.118
<v Interviewer>Yes, yes!</v>

912
00:40:36.118 --> 00:40:38.359
Well so normally I ask this in the beginning,

913
00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:43.183
but clearly, this passion about the energy and sun

914
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:44.820
came from somewhere.

915
00:40:44.837 --> 00:40:47.479
Where in you was this given birth to?

916
00:40:47.763 --> 00:40:49.081
What inspired this?

917
00:40:49.539 --> 00:40:53.528
<v ->Well I had an epiphany when I was 17.</v>

918
00:40:55.147 --> 00:40:57.162
When I did a sungazing for the first,

919
00:40:57.283 --> 00:40:58.915
only time in my life initially,

920
00:40:58.943 --> 00:41:01.149
and I sort of had an experience in Berkeley, California,

921
00:41:01.149 --> 00:41:03.152
where I was starting into the sun,

922
00:41:03.483 --> 00:41:05.602
and I recognized that it was a life form,

923
00:41:07.593 --> 00:41:08.470
very clearly,

924
00:41:09.323 --> 00:41:13.189
but I didn't really use that information

925
00:41:13.189 --> 00:41:14.164
to do anything with it.

926
00:41:14.164 --> 00:41:16.318
I got sucked into the whole natural food industry,

927
00:41:16.428 --> 00:41:19.238
and veggie burgers, and spent 30-odd years

928
00:41:19.238 --> 00:41:20.509
doing all of that.

929
00:41:21.026 --> 00:41:25.542
And it was only when people talked about the SETI,

930
00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:27.591
the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,

931
00:41:28.142 --> 00:41:29.832
I would kind of break cover,

932
00:41:30.511 --> 00:41:31.544
and I'd say, "Why are they sending all these

933
00:41:31.544 --> 00:41:32.578
"machines out there?"

934
00:41:32.578 --> 00:41:34.249
You know, meanwhile, the most intelligent thing

935
00:41:34.249 --> 00:41:36.369
in our neighborhood, we're completely ignoring

936
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.898
and sending cassette tapes and CD's out to space

937
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.371
to look for intelligence, you know, duh!

938
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.343
But I never sort of thought about writing about it.

939
00:41:45.488 --> 00:41:47.979
I wrote my first book on common sense.

940
00:41:48.065 --> 00:41:49.191
"Data's out of Date,"

941
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:51.949
and then after that I'm starting on a new book,

942
00:41:52.024 --> 00:41:53.818
and the new book was actually on a different subject,

943
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.107
but within a couple of chapters,

944
00:41:57.107 --> 00:41:59.052
I started to go into topic drift

945
00:41:59.743 --> 00:42:03.789
and talk about early man's approach to the sun,

946
00:42:03.911 --> 00:42:06.587
and I kept on that thread for a bit,

947
00:42:06.709 --> 00:42:08.456
and that's what made me realize,

948
00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:10.354
"This is your book,"

949
00:42:10.354 --> 00:42:13.779
and I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought about

950
00:42:13.779 --> 00:42:15.469
writing a book about it before,

951
00:42:15.556 --> 00:42:17.907
'cause I love doing things,

952
00:42:18.028 --> 00:42:19.381
bringing things into the culture

953
00:42:19.387 --> 00:42:21.732
that people either don't know about

954
00:42:21.732 --> 00:42:22.818
or have forgotten,

955
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.150
and in the '60s it was "you are what you eat,"

956
00:42:27.038 --> 00:42:29.018
what you eat affects your health

957
00:42:29.441 --> 00:42:31.438
was a really out-there hippy concept.

958
00:42:31.438 --> 00:42:33.238
Nobody believed that diet affected health

959
00:42:33.238 --> 00:42:34.289
in any way.

960
00:42:34.805 --> 00:42:35.838
<v Interviewer>In the '60s, that's true.</v>

961
00:42:35.838 --> 00:42:37.173
<v ->And it's quite extraordinary.</v>

962
00:42:37.173 --> 00:42:38.457
Now, you sort of ask people,

963
00:42:39.112 --> 00:42:40.517
I've done a few times, how many people believe

964
00:42:40.517 --> 00:42:42.421
diet affects health, and they all raise their hands

965
00:42:42.421 --> 00:42:43.797
think, "What a stupid question!"

966
00:42:43.897 --> 00:42:44.871
You know, obvious.

967
00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:46.115
<v Interviewer>Right, it's so true.</v>

968
00:42:46.115 --> 00:42:49.354
<v ->And this is the awareness of the sun as a life form</v>

969
00:42:49.354 --> 00:42:52.646
is so obvious and so hidden from our culture,

970
00:42:52.663 --> 00:42:54.822
and once I sort of recognized,

971
00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:58.596
"My God, this is really a very important thing to do,"

972
00:42:58.596 --> 00:42:59.821
and great fun.

973
00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:02.387
<v Interviewer>Well it seems like it's a progression, also.</v>

974
00:43:02.671 --> 00:43:05.417
To recognize that what you put into your body as fuel

975
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.495
affects what you become.

976
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:09.596
Okay, step number one.

977
00:43:09.904 --> 00:43:11.030
And then we start looking at the,

978
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.159
kind of a continued journey of the quality

979
00:43:14.316 --> 00:43:15.204
of what you're putting in.

980
00:43:15.279 --> 00:43:18.124
I mean, first it was just maybe replace white bread

981
00:43:18.124 --> 00:43:20.440
with brown bread, and so on.

982
00:43:20.689 --> 00:43:24.660
And now we're coming more into the whole foods,

983
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.013
juices, organic,

984
00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.542
and now more even into liquids, lots of chlorophyll.

985
00:43:29.664 --> 00:43:30.999
Now we're getting closer to the sun.

986
00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:31.818
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

987
00:43:31.951 --> 00:43:34.755
<v Interviewer>Everything we've done, certainly in the West</v>

988
00:43:34.772 --> 00:43:36.433
and certainly we live in California,

989
00:43:36.433 --> 00:43:40.189
so certainly in California has been a journey back toward,

990
00:43:41.042 --> 00:43:43.695
really toward the sun in terms of the food chain.

991
00:43:44.107 --> 00:43:46.330
'Cause I know we're heavily focused on chlorophyll,

992
00:43:46.475 --> 00:43:49.465
wheatgrasses, green juices,

993
00:43:50.214 --> 00:43:55.214
which are simply allowing our bodies to absorb

994
00:43:56.994 --> 00:43:59.438
the creation of the sun, the chlorophyll from the sun.

995
00:43:59.594 --> 00:44:00.256
<v ->Yeah, pure--</v>

996
00:44:00.256 --> 00:44:01.266
<v Interviewer>So we're going closer and closer</v>

997
00:44:01.266 --> 00:44:03.797
to the sun even in dietary forms, now.

998
00:44:03.797 --> 00:44:06.398
<v ->Yeah, because it's all created by,</v>

999
00:44:06.398 --> 00:44:08.714
photosynthesis is made by light,

1000
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:11.971
and we're getting, get with the chlorophyll

1001
00:44:11.971 --> 00:44:14.444
and spirulina and things that are really very, very pure.

1002
00:44:14.444 --> 00:44:15.779
<v Interviewer>Spirulinas, and so forth.</v>

1003
00:44:15.779 --> 00:44:16.615
<v ->Pre-transmissions, yeah.</v>

1004
00:44:16.615 --> 00:44:17.381
<v Interviewer>So now--</v>

1005
00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:18.972
<v ->And we had the Mayan calendar, so much interest</v>

1006
00:44:18.972 --> 00:44:21.653
in the Mayan calendar over here,

1007
00:44:21.653 --> 00:44:23.331
and the druids and Stonehenge,

1008
00:44:23.917 --> 00:44:25.398
books on the pyramids,

1009
00:44:26.146 --> 00:44:28.387
and yet there was that one common thread

1010
00:44:28.387 --> 00:44:29.740
that held them all together,

1011
00:44:30.129 --> 00:44:32.091
which was recognition of the sun

1012
00:44:32.091 --> 00:44:34.442
as the most important character in our movie,

1013
00:44:35.098 --> 00:44:38.378
and that doesn't come through in books on the Mayan calendar

1014
00:44:38.465 --> 00:44:39.516
and the pyramids.

1015
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.452
It just seems to be sort of skirted over

1016
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.087
by everybody looking at these subjects,

1017
00:44:46.336 --> 00:44:50.075
and not even intentionally, it's just not in our head set.

1018
00:44:50.075 --> 00:44:52.995
It was burnt out, literally, for many centuries.

1019
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.077
<v Interviewer>Indeed, and even when you look at</v>

1020
00:44:56.077 --> 00:44:59.601
some of the authors that are revealing

1021
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.986
some of the darker agendas that have taken place

1022
00:45:01.986 --> 00:45:03.519
through secret societies and so forth,

1023
00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:06.706
it's almost as though the sun becomes inadvertently

1024
00:45:07.397 --> 00:45:11.211
set aside or dismissed in that journey, as well,

1025
00:45:11.263 --> 00:45:14.648
because it was the quote, "sun worship,"

1026
00:45:14.966 --> 00:45:17.973
or symbolism was co-opted by groups that may have had

1027
00:45:17.973 --> 00:45:20.859
a more undesirable agenda.

1028
00:45:20.973 --> 00:45:21.542
<v ->Yes.</v>

1029
00:45:21.642 --> 00:45:23.697
<v Interviewer>Still, the sun gets thrown out,</v>

1030
00:45:23.697 --> 00:45:25.381
the baby gets thrown out with the bath water.

1031
00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:27.912
<v ->Because the Freemasons still recognize</v>

1032
00:45:27.912 --> 00:45:30.158
that it's been sort of suppressed in all of us,

1033
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:31.563
and they still recognize it,

1034
00:45:31.952 --> 00:45:34.051
because they do, oh, it's bad, you know?

1035
00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:36.120
Yeah, it's really tricky.

1036
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.956
<v Interviewer>But I've seen that lot.</v>

1037
00:45:36.956 --> 00:45:37.845
<v ->I have, too.</v>

1038
00:45:38.094 --> 00:45:42.529
I get Google word alerts for "sun worship" and "sun god,"

1039
00:45:42.529 --> 00:45:44.312
and all of the, any time that comes up on Google,

1040
00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:45.635
I get the alert.

1041
00:45:45.966 --> 00:45:48.851
And more than nine out of 10 times,

1042
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.202
it's something saying, "Oh, it's bad,

1043
00:45:51.202 --> 00:45:52.555
"because the Masons do it,"

1044
00:45:52.734 --> 00:45:54.376
or we shouldn't, there's Christian things saying

1045
00:45:54.376 --> 00:45:56.229
"Why are we worshiping on a Sunday?"

1046
00:45:56.745 --> 00:45:59.596
You know, that's bad, that's evil, it's the satan,

1047
00:45:59.613 --> 00:46:01.510
it's incredible how people would demonize this.

1048
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.276
<v Interviewer>We have to become a little more</v>

1049
00:46:02.276 --> 00:46:04.395
sophisticated, because I mean,

1050
00:46:06.351 --> 00:46:08.325
people need to, I think we have to become

1051
00:46:08.325 --> 00:46:09.701
a little clearer in our thinking,

1052
00:46:09.927 --> 00:46:11.744
and separate out, I mean, there are

1053
00:46:11.831 --> 00:46:13.990
agendas galore, and have been for the last several

1054
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.774
thousand years.

1055
00:46:15.163 --> 00:46:18.083
Separate out the agendas with the reality

1056
00:46:18.298 --> 00:46:21.717
of what was originally the base subject of interest.

1057
00:46:21.873 --> 00:46:24.457
Yes, of course, I mean, if the Masonics or whomever

1058
00:46:24.602 --> 00:46:27.841
chooses to still acknowledge or worship the sun,

1059
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:30.848
well, that's just a remnant from something they received

1060
00:46:30.848 --> 00:46:33.257
long ago that was core to their belief system.

1061
00:46:33.483 --> 00:46:37.245
It doesn't, we just said this, it doesn't mean that

1062
00:46:37.245 --> 00:46:39.538
this is an evil practice in and of itself,

1063
00:46:39.648 --> 00:46:41.768
we just don't agree with those particular agendas.

1064
00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:44.705
<v ->Yeah, and they're still getting power and energy from it.</v>

1065
00:46:44.792 --> 00:46:45.825
<v Interviewer>Yes, they're utilizing it.</v>

1066
00:46:46.551 --> 00:46:47.346
<v ->And we're not.</v>

1067
00:46:47.561 --> 00:46:48.861
So it's a bit of a challenge.

1068
00:46:48.861 --> 00:46:50.109
<v Interviewer>Yeah, where's the sense in that?</v>

1069
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.853
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

1070
00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:52.959
<v Interviewer>I mean, the whole thing's so</v>

1071
00:46:52.959 --> 00:46:53.813
upside-down.

1072
00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:57.749
I think it's why I find the sun so absolutely fascinating.

1073
00:46:57.905 --> 00:46:59.421
besides that fact that it's,

1074
00:47:00.111 --> 00:47:03.908
I think this is the, probably the most important journey

1075
00:47:03.908 --> 00:47:06.189
humanity really needs to go on now,

1076
00:47:06.845 --> 00:47:09.213
is an attempt to begin understanding

1077
00:47:09.213 --> 00:47:13.625
what the sun is, the nature of going back into rhythm

1078
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:16.551
with that information, and right now, what about

1079
00:47:16.551 --> 00:47:17.707
this period of time?

1080
00:47:17.828 --> 00:47:19.593
Many people talk about the sun and a lot of

1081
00:47:19.593 --> 00:47:23.384
the solar activity, the shifting of the magnetic fields,

1082
00:47:23.424 --> 00:47:24.562
the dimensional shift,

1083
00:47:24.562 --> 00:47:26.182
and all that's going on at this time.

1084
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.601
How do you perceive the human interaction

1085
00:47:29.601 --> 00:47:32.683
with the sun, and its affect on us during this transition?

1086
00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:35.563
I know, it's kind of a big question.

1087
00:47:35.568 --> 00:47:37.844
I mean if you had just any intuitive thoughts

1088
00:47:37.844 --> 00:47:38.877
or feelings on it.

1089
00:47:38.877 --> 00:47:39.852
Your own impressions.

1090
00:47:39.852 --> 00:47:42.494
<v ->I think the most important thing that we can do</v>

1091
00:47:43.219 --> 00:47:45.553
during this whole transition is to recognize

1092
00:47:45.553 --> 00:47:47.509
the nature of the sun,

1093
00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:52.943
and certainly, we have this wealth of

1094
00:47:53.064 --> 00:47:55.416
technological knowledge about the sun

1095
00:47:56.234 --> 00:47:57.645
that we never used to have,

1096
00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:02.805
and if you were to take a Mayan or a druid or

1097
00:48:02.805 --> 00:48:05.777
an Egyptian and set them down and tell them

1098
00:48:05.777 --> 00:48:07.310
what we know about the sun right now,

1099
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.326
it'd blow their minds.

1100
00:48:09.179 --> 00:48:10.265
<v Interviewer>Unless they already knew it.</v>

1101
00:48:10.816 --> 00:48:11.350
<v ->Well--</v>

1102
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.174
<v Interviewer>More or less.</v>

1103
00:48:12.174 --> 00:48:13.597
<v ->Not about the seven layers</v>

1104
00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:17.318
and the heliosphere and the nucleosynthesis

1105
00:48:17.318 --> 00:48:18.601
that makes all the elements out of it.

1106
00:48:18.653 --> 00:48:19.454
They would just say,

1107
00:48:19.454 --> 00:48:22.890
they would be so many more reasons

1108
00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.852
to connect with the sun, they would probably

1109
00:48:24.852 --> 00:48:26.647
be able to do stuff with that information

1110
00:48:27.662 --> 00:48:31.267
to refine and develop the techniques they already had,

1111
00:48:31.459 --> 00:48:33.346
and yet we do nothing with it,

1112
00:48:34.198 --> 00:48:35.975
because we're completely ignorant about

1113
00:48:35.975 --> 00:48:38.169
the nature of the sun, even though we know

1114
00:48:38.169 --> 00:48:40.753
so much about it, and to combine those two

1115
00:48:41.803 --> 00:48:42.993
would be really powerful.

1116
00:48:43.347 --> 00:48:45.147
<v Interviewer>So let's talk about the more practical</v>

1117
00:48:45.147 --> 00:48:48.177
part of your book in terms of what we can do,

1118
00:48:48.177 --> 00:48:49.721
some of the exercises you talk about

1119
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:51.880
about becoming acquainted again with the sun,

1120
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.111
that every human being can do.

1121
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:55.335
<v ->Well, it's the simplest one is,</v>

1122
00:48:55.828 --> 00:48:58.470
that I developed is just where you shut your eyes

1123
00:48:58.614 --> 00:49:00.699
and look straight at it.

1124
00:49:00.959 --> 00:49:02.689
Now some people will find their eyes

1125
00:49:02.689 --> 00:49:04.826
are so sensitive that even that's difficult,

1126
00:49:04.826 --> 00:49:06.335
you know, you shouldn't be squinting,

1127
00:49:07.185 --> 00:49:09.290
and with sunglasses,

1128
00:49:09.528 --> 00:49:14.062
the UV-protected sunglasses is very possibly

1129
00:49:14.439 --> 00:49:17.463
as much a cause of skin cancer,

1130
00:49:17.608 --> 00:49:20.366
more a cause of skin cancer than sun.

1131
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.922
Because our skin produces melanin which protects us,

1132
00:49:24.922 --> 00:49:27.523
it doesn't protect us, it helps absorb the good rays

1133
00:49:27.523 --> 00:49:29.898
from the sun, and process them properly,

1134
00:49:30.286 --> 00:49:32.104
and it's important to that process.

1135
00:49:32.643 --> 00:49:35.111
And that's determined by how much UV

1136
00:49:35.255 --> 00:49:37.015
is reaching is.

1137
00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:40.062
Now where are we gonna measure ultraviolet light?

1138
00:49:40.062 --> 00:49:42.413
Through our eyes or through our skin?

1139
00:49:42.523 --> 00:49:44.776
I mean, our eyes are our light-receiving organs.

1140
00:49:44.776 --> 00:49:45.455
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

1141
00:49:45.472 --> 00:49:47.307
<v ->And if you then put sunglasses on</v>

1142
00:49:47.307 --> 00:49:49.373
so you can't tell how much UV light is coming through,

1143
00:49:49.373 --> 00:49:50.598
your skin isn't gonna react,

1144
00:49:51.242 --> 00:49:52.932
so you're gonna be open to burning,

1145
00:49:53.576 --> 00:49:57.332
and that's a very counterproductive thing to wear that.

1146
00:49:57.384 --> 00:50:01.842
But anyway, just looking with your eyes shut

1147
00:50:01.842 --> 00:50:04.043
at the sun and just feeling the rays,

1148
00:50:04.257 --> 00:50:06.945
feeling those vibrations and bringing them into your body,

1149
00:50:07.427 --> 00:50:09.667
sending them through your body to sort of heal

1150
00:50:09.667 --> 00:50:11.862
ailing difficult parts, you know,

1151
00:50:11.862 --> 00:50:14.654
taking it in on the inhalation,

1152
00:50:14.869 --> 00:50:17.417
on the exhalation, you're blowing out the garbage

1153
00:50:17.574 --> 00:50:21.068
and the bad vibrations you don't want in your body.

1154
00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:23.362
That's a really nice, easy, five, 10 minute,

1155
00:50:23.448 --> 00:50:26.334
15 minute thing you can do, do any day.

1156
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:30.589
Yogis will know about this sun worship

1157
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:32.963
with the sun salutation in the morning.

1158
00:50:33.607 --> 00:50:36.678
Getting sunlight on your skin, really important,

1159
00:50:36.695 --> 00:50:40.440
and something as simple as sesame oil or olive oil

1160
00:50:40.794 --> 00:50:45.479
are the ideal means to help your body absorb the sunlight

1161
00:50:46.099 --> 00:50:48.596
without having any damage from it,

1162
00:50:48.596 --> 00:50:50.181
much better than all the creams

1163
00:50:50.198 --> 00:50:52.102
and things that you're being, people spend

1164
00:50:52.102 --> 00:50:53.919
millions of dollars advertising to us.

1165
00:50:55.714 --> 00:50:58.425
It's just such an asset to good health

1166
00:50:58.639 --> 00:51:00.015
and good spirituality.

1167
00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.928
I mean, it's corny, but dark, bad deeds

1168
00:51:04.084 --> 00:51:06.273
or dark deeds are always done in the dark of night.

1169
00:51:06.581 --> 00:51:07.289
<v Interviewer>That's right.</v>

1170
00:51:07.289 --> 00:51:08.944
<v ->That's when people went out and did bad stuff,</v>

1171
00:51:09.193 --> 00:51:10.546
because you don't want to do it

1172
00:51:10.656 --> 00:51:12.455
when the sun is shining and it's a nice day,

1173
00:51:12.455 --> 00:51:13.755
it's not conducive to it,

1174
00:51:13.755 --> 00:51:16.728
it lifts our spirituality.

1175
00:51:16.728 --> 00:51:18.365
<v Interviewer>Covert activity works best in the dark.</v>

1176
00:51:18.365 --> 00:51:19.003
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1177
00:51:19.003 --> 00:51:19.630
<v Interviewer>Cloaked.</v>

1178
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:21.163
<v ->It's not just because you can't see it,</v>

1179
00:51:21.163 --> 00:51:21.964
it's because--

1180
00:51:21.964 --> 00:51:24.332
<v Interviewer>There's a deeper psychology to that.</v>

1181
00:51:24.332 --> 00:51:25.540
<v ->Absolutely, yeah, yeah.</v>

1182
00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.466
<v Interviewer>And we all know this.</v>

1183
00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:28.724
We all know that as soon as the sun hits our skin,

1184
00:51:28.776 --> 00:51:32.161
we suddenly feel enlivened, we can take a deeper breath,

1185
00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:35.261
as I mentioned earlier, sunrise and sunset

1186
00:51:35.278 --> 00:51:36.880
is a ritual that virtually everyone

1187
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.233
on the planet appreciates,

1188
00:51:38.714 --> 00:51:42.218
and so maybe we just begin by very gentle explorations

1189
00:51:42.218 --> 00:51:44.976
of the sun, and maybe even inquiry and meditation.

1190
00:51:46.026 --> 00:51:48.807
<v ->Yeah, but the awareness is the first thing.</v>

1191
00:51:48.824 --> 00:51:50.867
It's like once you know that what you eat

1192
00:51:50.867 --> 00:51:54.002
affects your health, then you start to look at your diet

1193
00:51:54.002 --> 00:51:56.301
and say, "Oh yeah, this made me sick,

1194
00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:58.576
"this made me feel good," and you learn.

1195
00:51:58.576 --> 00:52:01.555
And once you know that the sun is a living being,

1196
00:52:01.606 --> 00:52:04.631
we're receiving loving vibrations from that living being,

1197
00:52:05.252 --> 00:52:08.282
you start to react in positive, productive, useful ways

1198
00:52:08.282 --> 00:52:09.531
to that knowledge.

1199
00:52:09.687 --> 00:52:11.133
<v Interviewer>Yes, I think it's critical,</v>

1200
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.286
especially now, as we're expanding our awareness

1201
00:52:13.286 --> 00:52:14.888
and consciousness as a species,

1202
00:52:14.888 --> 00:52:16.067
which appears to be happening.

1203
00:52:16.189 --> 00:52:17.918
We have evidence of that every day.

1204
00:52:17.918 --> 00:52:18.987
<v ->Yeah, pretty much.</v>

1205
00:52:18.987 --> 00:52:21.192
<v Interviewer>From thousands of people around the planet,</v>

1206
00:52:21.192 --> 00:52:23.224
so I say, I'm with you, let the sun

1207
00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:25.111
be our greatest ally in this journey.

1208
00:52:25.569 --> 00:52:26.214
<v ->Great.</v>

1209
00:52:26.905 --> 00:52:27.979
It's there for us.

1210
00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:29.227
<v Interviewer>Thank you, Gregory.</v>

1211
00:52:29.227 --> 00:52:30.057
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

1212
00:52:32.768 --> 00:52:34.103
<v ->The sun has been a central theme</v>

1213
00:52:34.103 --> 00:52:35.542
that's coming up again and again

1214
00:52:35.542 --> 00:52:36.524
in our interviews.

1215
00:52:36.715 --> 00:52:38.799
If you'd like to explore Gregory's work a little further,

1216
00:52:38.874 --> 00:52:40.215
you can order "Sun of God,"

1217
00:52:40.215 --> 00:52:42.566
and that's pronounced S-U-N of God,

1218
00:52:42.688 --> 00:52:44.934
through Amazon and other major booksellers.

1219
00:52:45.288 --> 00:52:47.622
Along this line, you might also enjoy my conversations

1220
00:52:47.622 --> 00:52:49.915
with Lucy Wyatt and Walter Crettendon.

1221
00:52:50.118 --> 00:52:52.411
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
