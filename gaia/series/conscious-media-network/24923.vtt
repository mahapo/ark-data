1
00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:03.328
<v ->Before there was Fung Shui, there was Vastu.</v>

2
00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:06.048
Vastu is the 7 to10,000 year-old science

3
00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:08.277
of building harmonious structures.

4
00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:09.717
When this science is applied,

5
00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:11.434
it allows the energy in the building

6
00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:13.845
to flow freely, without obstructions.

7
00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:15.893
Free-flowing energy supports a more abundant,

8
00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:19.882
peaceful and harmonious life at home or in business.

9
00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.399
One of the top Vastu experts in the country

10
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:23.689
is Michael Mastro.

11
00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.089
His wife Robin has written an award-winning book

12
00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.012
on how to create the powerful principles of Vastu

13
00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:32.108
in small spaces she refers to as "alters."

14
00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:46.781
Vastu is a 7 to 10,000-year-old practice

15
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:48.392
to the best of your knowledge,

16
00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:51.812
and it is the grand-pappy to Fung Shui.

17
00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.125
So let's begin with the science behind Vastu,

18
00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.250
because often people think this is just a belief system,

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.735
but in fact, there's a science behind it.

20
00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.708
<v ->Actually where it came from</v>

21
00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.727
or the scientific aspects of it?

22
00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:07.953
<v Voiceover>The scientific aspects of it</v>

23
00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:10.342
and a little bit of background about where it came from.

24
00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:11.185
<v ->OK.</v>

25
00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:16.059
So, the actual science came from the Vedas,

26
00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.587
which are an ancient body of knowledge.

27
00:01:18.587 --> 00:01:22.720
And one part of the Vedas is called Atharva Veda

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.245
and it deals with improving the quality of our life.

29
00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:29.402
The Vedas were written by ancient seers, who--

30
00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:32.069
<v Voiceover>In India.</v>

31
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.906
<v ->In India, who observed the workings of nature</v>

32
00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.103
and its effect on the human organism.

33
00:01:37.103 --> 00:01:39.449
And part of what they observed

34
00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:42.500
was the environmental influences.

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.422
So, the Atharva Veda takes into account Arya Veda

36
00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:47.844
which is the science of healing and medicine,

37
00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:51.769
Dhanur Veda, which is the science of self-defence,

38
00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:55.096
Jyotish, which is Indian astrology,

39
00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:58.019
the influence of the planets and the stars on us,

40
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:02.525
and yoga, meditation and Vastu Shastra.

41
00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:05.325
Vastu means building, shastra means science,

42
00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.616
science of building.

43
00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:09.293
So they studied the effects of

44
00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:13.122
the natural forces of nature on the human organism

45
00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:18.092
in different situations, in different dwellings, basically.

46
00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:21.612
<v Voiceover>So they made a science of being able to</v>

47
00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:25.004
alter the energy within a space.

48
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:25.718
<v ->Yes.</v>

49
00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Voiceover>And that is what you're doing in essence</v>

50
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.526
in your practice and in your book.

51
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:32.939
Now, people seem to be more familiar

52
00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.958
with the term Fung Shui, and maybe just very briefly,

53
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.635
you can tell us a little hop-scotch path

54
00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:40.715
between Vastu and Fung Shui.

55
00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:41.397
<v ->Sure.</v>

56
00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:44.458
Vastu is about 7 to 10,000-years-old

57
00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:48.757
and about 3,000 years ago, it was carried by monks

58
00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:51.103
over the mountains from India to China,

59
00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:53.290
and from there it was adapted to local

60
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.583
culture and climatic conditions

61
00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.748
and became known as Fung Shui.

62
00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:00.436
The goal of Vastu and Fung Shui is the same,

63
00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:03.593
to raise the level of life-force energy.

64
00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:06.409
And in China they call it Chi

65
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.267
and in India they call it Prahna.

66
00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:14.267
To create a situation where Chi or Prahna

67
00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:18.284
can move freely in a space and uplift

68
00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:21.035
the individual in that environment.

69
00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.337
<v Voiceover>Somewhat like the human body,</v>

70
00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:24.289
as energy moves freely through the human body,

71
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.283
you have good health and a house

72
00:03:26.283 --> 00:03:29.376
is an extension of our lives and has a life of it's own,

73
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.019
so it's about freeing energy then,

74
00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.109
to move through our house in the same--

75
00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.037
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

76
00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:38.090
And we were just speaking about these different disciplines,

77
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.386
Jyotish, Yoga, Meditation, Arya Veda,

78
00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:45.055
all of these would deal with balancing the five elements

79
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:48.820
within the body, earth, water, fire, air, and space.

80
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.249
<v Voiceover>And this takes us, really,</v>

81
00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.318
into the alter, the creation of the alters then.

82
00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:53.064
<v ->That's correct.</v>

83
00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:54.878
<v Voiceover>You're taking all of these elements</v>

84
00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:57.779
into consideration and placing them very specifically

85
00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.075
and this leads to some exciting results.

86
00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:04.040
And you came up with the alters,

87
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.487
really out of desperation, from what I'm understanding.

88
00:04:08.487 --> 00:04:10.098
And if you could talk about that,

89
00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:12.743
just a brief bit before we get into

90
00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:14.578
another area I wanna ask you about,

91
00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:19.578
which is some of the larger types of clients and bodies.

92
00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.331
This isn't something that just people

93
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.081
in the metaphysical community use,

94
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:26.192
but in other countries, every bank, every business,

95
00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:28.400
everything's based on these principles,

96
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.109
so let's start with you and how it started with you.

97
00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.128
<v ->Well, about 20 years ago, I think my first</v>

98
00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:37.104
introduction to alters happened,

99
00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:41.487
where I was coming out of a very difficult time in my life,

100
00:04:41.487 --> 00:04:46.487
and had a awakened sense of creating a small environment

101
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.310
where I would put everything of value

102
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.096
into a certain pattern on the full moon

103
00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:58.414
and allow the energy of the moon

104
00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:01.507
to energize that to bring about change in my life.

105
00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:03.896
<v Voiceover>And this really came about in a vision.</v>

106
00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:06.360
<v ->It was a very organic sort of vision</v>

107
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.704
that sort of came through meditation.

108
00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:11.821
I didn't realize that the pattern was

109
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:14.093
something that, many years later,

110
00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:17.463
would actually be the pattern that I would use

111
00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:21.943
in a graduate project to create small environments,

112
00:05:21.943 --> 00:05:25.217
or alters, based on the sacred science of Vastu.

113
00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:27.501
<v Voiceover>So, you've co-written this book</v>

114
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:30.775
on creating sacred spaces within the home

115
00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:33.026
or the workspace and these little alters.

116
00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:39.340
First of all, how big are some of the clients

117
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.199
that you've had, how big are some of the institutions,

118
00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.260
historically, that utilize this and to what end?

119
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.233
Before we go personal, let's talk about that.

120
00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:48.534
The macro.

121
00:05:48.534 --> 00:05:51.627
<v ->In the early 80s, I designed and built</v>

122
00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:53.387
the first Microsoft building,

123
00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:56.011
according to the principles of Vastu.

124
00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:59.638
And then in those few years, in the early 80s,

125
00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:02.752
I also built several Boeing buildings,

126
00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:07.552
utilizing these principles and we have presently

127
00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:11.359
clients all over the world, doctors, dentists,

128
00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:16.351
I've done several individual offices at Microsoft,

129
00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:21.087
Rosetta, just several different types of businesses,

130
00:06:21.087 --> 00:06:24.029
spas and--

131
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.638
<v Voiceover>So, Bill Gates actually understood enough</v>

132
00:06:26.638 --> 00:06:29.065
to have the vision to say, "We're not starting this business

133
00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:31.476
"without the proper Vastu."

134
00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:32.702
Is that how it happened?

135
00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:34.771
<v ->Well, you can say that, in a round-about way.</v>

136
00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:37.352
He didn't even know that I utilized this knowledge,

137
00:06:37.352 --> 00:06:41.086
but he picked us to build the building

138
00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:43.880
and so in a round-about way, intuitively,

139
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.483
he probably did know that it would be good

140
00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:49.682
to create a good start for his business.

141
00:06:49.682 --> 00:06:51.005
<v Voiceover>Well, I'll say!</v>

142
00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:53.938
<v ->One of the other things, other organizations</v>

143
00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:58.482
that recently we've presented Vastu to,

144
00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:01.020
is the World Bank in Washington, DC.

145
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.103
And Mike is scheduled to go next month

146
00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:06.801
to speak at NASA, about Vastu.

147
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:11.281
So, there is interest in the corporate community

148
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:16.177
about what we do and I think that in any circumstance,

149
00:07:16.177 --> 00:07:19.963
stress in the workplace is a huge issue.

150
00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:21.616
<v Voiceover>Do you think that most</v>

151
00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:25.190
of the really large corporate entities

152
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.667
have had some exposure or understanding

153
00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:31.664
of energetic forces behind what makes

154
00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:35.685
a business truly lucrative and progressive?

155
00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:37.701
<v ->I don't know if that's so much true</v>

156
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:41.189
as there are always individuals in corporations

157
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:45.732
and those are the individuals, they're like seeds, you know?

158
00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:48.036
They're planted there and somehow

159
00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:51.631
know or hear about us and find it intriguing,

160
00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:54.308
and want us to come.

161
00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:58.734
So, in a way we're bringing light into those corporations

162
00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:01.891
at maybe at a higher level of consciousness,

163
00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:04.088
you know, the executive level may not

164
00:08:04.088 --> 00:08:06.040
be aware of what we do, but that doesn't

165
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.387
discount the possibility that they also

166
00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:12.141
are open to the ideas of creating more

167
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:16.653
a supportive work environment for their employees.

168
00:08:16.653 --> 00:08:19.533
Because that only aids them on the other end.

169
00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.847
Recently, there was a study that, uh,

170
00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:24.855
what did they say?

171
00:08:24.855 --> 00:08:28.012
Like the amount of people who had sick days

172
00:08:28.012 --> 00:08:30.615
has escalated to a rampant level,

173
00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:32.471
that productivity has fallen,

174
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:36.332
they said the cost of insurance has escalated

175
00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:39.436
and so much of our illness is based on stress.

176
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:43.041
So, these are things that human resource divisions

177
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:45.312
in all corporations are beginning to look at

178
00:08:45.312 --> 00:08:48.886
and take very serious, they take serious, seriously

179
00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:50.859
how the environment is affecting them,

180
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:53.088
affecting their work force,

181
00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:55.115
because it affects them on a money level.

182
00:08:55.115 --> 00:08:57.408
<v Voiceover>Mm, so it's starting to make sense.</v>

183
00:08:57.408 --> 00:08:59.360
Looking to the old traditions, they're starting to

184
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.887
make sense on many levels, not the least

185
00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:03.125
of which is money.

186
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:04.671
So let's continue on.

187
00:09:04.671 --> 00:09:06.719
So, you were having a hard time in life

188
00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:08.340
and you had this vision that you needed to

189
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.276
put things in, you said, a bowl with a reflective surface

190
00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:14.153
on the new moon, or the full moon.

191
00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:15.198
<v ->Right, the full moon.</v>

192
00:09:15.198 --> 00:09:16.041
<v Voiceover>And what happened?</v>

193
00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:17.598
How did that lead to this?

194
00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:20.617
<v ->Well, it didn't really lead to everything,</v>

195
00:09:20.617 --> 00:09:23.145
but what it did give me was a definite

196
00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:25.768
understanding of my connection to the divine

197
00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:27.944
and that I wasn't alone.

198
00:09:27.944 --> 00:09:32.331
And I think, for me at the time, as a young mother,

199
00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:35.133
with a very young infant, who had just come

200
00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:37.640
out of a very rough period, the feeling

201
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.232
that I had some power in my life

202
00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:41.746
was very important to me.

203
00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:45.394
And it supported my abundance for the,

204
00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:47.783
for the next twenty years.

205
00:09:47.783 --> 00:09:49.223
<v Voiceover>So you're saying after</v>

206
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:50.866
you did this first meditation--

207
00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:51.868
<v ->The first meditation--</v>

208
00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:53.052
<v Voiceover>How did things change</v>

209
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:54.076
after you did your first?

210
00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:56.487
<v ->The first full moon after the meditation,</v>

211
00:09:56.487 --> 00:10:00.252
I put together an alter out on our porch

212
00:10:00.252 --> 00:10:04.849
and using what I remembered from the vision that I had

213
00:10:04.849 --> 00:10:08.277
placed the elements in a very specific pattern

214
00:10:08.277 --> 00:10:12.240
and had this offering bowl in the center

215
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.515
that was what I saw in my vision

216
00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:18.043
to be a hammered chalice of metal,

217
00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:20.389
but I had nothing similar to that,

218
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:25.389
so I used a, my salad bowl, wrapped in aluminum foil

219
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:29.284
and in it I put everything of value that I had in the house,

220
00:10:29.284 --> 00:10:32.164
so all the money, my check book,

221
00:10:33.444 --> 00:10:36.164
things that I really felt were valuable to me,

222
00:10:36.164 --> 00:10:38.553
I placed in that and surrounded them,

223
00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:41.198
surrounded this bowl with the elements

224
00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:45.198
in a specific pattern, water, the air, fire, the earth

225
00:10:45.198 --> 00:10:49.262
and I never had a sense of being

226
00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:53.187
stressed around money again.

227
00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:56.397
And my life changed dramatically.

228
00:10:56.397 --> 00:10:59.256
In fact, I went from counting pennies to food

229
00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:03.736
to a lifestyle that most people are pretty envious of.

230
00:11:03.736 --> 00:11:08.290
So, I really believe that that's, I'm not unusual.

231
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.871
I believe that what happened to me

232
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:13.964
I could show other people how to do.

233
00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:17.559
My book, or our book, Alters of Power and Grace

234
00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:22.559
is an outcropping of many years of research in the field

235
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.308
of finding how to create powerful, small environments

236
00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:29.537
that will transform people's lives.

237
00:11:29.537 --> 00:11:31.094
<v Voiceover>Let me ask you about that.</v>

238
00:11:31.094 --> 00:11:32.950
Say you go into an environment

239
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.640
and the house itself, maybe on a Vastu level,

240
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.776
isn't that well-laid-out, energy's blocked all over

241
00:11:39.776 --> 00:11:44.426
the place, and no Prahna or Chi really happening there.

242
00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:48.416
Can you take a small space within that house,

243
00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:52.106
create the alter, and still have the effects,

244
00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:53.684
even though the larger environment

245
00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:55.455
might not be supporting that energy?

246
00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:58.356
<v ->Alters would be definitely a tool that would help</v>

247
00:11:58.356 --> 00:12:01.023
balance the five elements in that environment,

248
00:12:01.023 --> 00:12:04.158
and reduce the stress, creating a

249
00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:06.292
sacred space within the environment.

250
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:10.729
Vastu is so vast, it talks about designing

251
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:14.675
the very, very smallest of tables and chairs and beds

252
00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.728
up into designing an entire city.

253
00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:22.067
Jaipur is a city that was designed based on Vastu.

254
00:12:22.067 --> 00:12:27.067
So, an alter is also described in the Vedas,

255
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.122
in Vastu, as long as you can get all five elements

256
00:12:31.122 --> 00:12:34.194
in their proper directions and proper proportions,

257
00:12:35.774 --> 00:12:37.468
then you can create something that

258
00:12:37.468 --> 00:12:39.858
definitely will have an influence on the environment.

259
00:12:39.858 --> 00:12:42.023
<v ->I wanted to add something,</v>

260
00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:44.593
Mike recently was brought on board

261
00:12:44.593 --> 00:12:47.249
for a new development that is being built

262
00:12:47.249 --> 00:12:51.334
outside of Washington, DC, it's a entire city

263
00:12:51.334 --> 00:12:55.793
and they redesigned the city once they brought Mike in,

264
00:12:55.793 --> 00:12:57.296
according to Vastu.

265
00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:58.224
<v Voiceover>Very interesting,</v>

266
00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:00.475
so people are beginning to take this very seriously,

267
00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:02.342
because having seen results obviously,

268
00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:04.496
or they wouldn't be taking it seriously.

269
00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:09.496
So, as a moment ago, you were talking about

270
00:13:10.997 --> 00:13:12.989
the large, if Vastu's very extensive, it can go

271
00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:16.028
from the micro to the macro.

272
00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:20.519
How, talk about, a little bit, if you would please,

273
00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:23.282
the intention that goes into it

274
00:13:23.282 --> 00:13:26.460
and your personal, emotional interaction with it,

275
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.850
and what that does to it.

276
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.846
And how necessary that is or isn't.

277
00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:36.262
<v ->It is a science, so the intention is</v>

278
00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:40.848
is not the foremost thing, although the intention

279
00:13:40.848 --> 00:13:44.006
definitely aids in anything you do, obviously.

280
00:13:44.006 --> 00:13:46.907
But what, basically what we're doing is,

281
00:13:46.907 --> 00:13:49.083
there's two forces of nature.

282
00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:52.314
The magnetic energy that comes from the north

283
00:13:52.314 --> 00:13:54.704
and solar energy that comes from the east.

284
00:13:54.704 --> 00:13:57.562
And they form an electromagnetic grid system

285
00:13:57.562 --> 00:13:59.183
that covers the Earth.

286
00:13:59.183 --> 00:14:00.367
You could think of them as

287
00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:02.203
longitudinal and latitudinal lines.

288
00:14:03.274 --> 00:14:07.179
And these, this grid system radiates energy

289
00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.269
that comes from the center of the Earth

290
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:11.243
and it also acts as a receptor

291
00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:14.304
for solar, lunar and stellar energies.

292
00:14:14.304 --> 00:14:16.021
The Earth is pulsating with life

293
00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.805
and radiating this life out through the grid system.

294
00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:20.831
And if we can align our bodies

295
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:23.338
and our buildings with that grid system,

296
00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:27.188
then it's like swimming with the flow of a river,

297
00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:30.719
instead of against the current of a river,

298
00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:33.364
and you gain that supportive nature.

299
00:14:33.364 --> 00:14:36.916
That's exactly what Vastu does in very simple terms.

300
00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:39.796
<v Voiceover>So, with creating a sacred space in your home,</v>

301
00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.099
such as one of these alters, you're creating

302
00:14:42.099 --> 00:14:44.489
that kind of energy vortex as it will,

303
00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:46.536
something you can swim with.

304
00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:49.854
<v ->It's just basically aligning yourself with nature,</v>

305
00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:51.294
or the divine.

306
00:14:51.294 --> 00:14:55.304
And when you partner with the divine, with nature,

307
00:14:55.304 --> 00:14:57.960
things just move so much easier

308
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.794
and there's so much less stress.

309
00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:01.095
<v Voiceover>So, give us some examples</v>

310
00:15:01.095 --> 00:15:03.911
with some other people besides yourself,

311
00:15:03.911 --> 00:15:06.322
that have had just these miraculous

312
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.159
changes of fortune and events in their lives

313
00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.705
as a result of setting up one

314
00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:12.455
of these powerful, little alters.

315
00:15:12.455 --> 00:15:14.470
Everybody loves these stories.

316
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.670
<v ->Well, before we start, I just wanted to make</v>

317
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.603
a clarification about the alters

318
00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:22.447
as opposed to the entire environment.

319
00:15:22.447 --> 00:15:23.466
<v Voiceover>Yes?</v>

320
00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:25.727
<v ->When Mike was talking about that the science</v>

321
00:15:25.727 --> 00:15:30.186
and the need for intention in that,

322
00:15:30.186 --> 00:15:34.180
I think that he was looking at the entire environment.

323
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.729
Part of the power of the alters,

324
00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:41.678
has to do with your desire for support from the divine.

325
00:15:41.678 --> 00:15:44.484
So there has to be a relationship there.

326
00:15:44.484 --> 00:15:47.779
And the alters actually, once ignited

327
00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.893
by a sacred ceremony that you can perform,

328
00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:53.773
there's several that I talk about in the book,

329
00:15:53.773 --> 00:15:57.185
the alter becomes alive, it becomes

330
00:15:57.185 --> 00:15:59.990
like a homing device for your highest intention.

331
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.798
So there is a certain amount of intentionality

332
00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:05.792
that goes into the alter.

333
00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:09.067
So I really did wanna clarify that piece.

334
00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Voiceover>And it seems that this intentionality</v>

335
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:16.626
is something that's been lost in western life.

336
00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:18.993
We're pretty busy, we're sort of blowing past

337
00:16:18.993 --> 00:16:21.244
all the things that, historically,

338
00:16:21.244 --> 00:16:25.521
have been considered sacred and worthy of reflection.

339
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:27.281
We don't seem to reflect much,

340
00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:29.585
so might this also not be a reminder

341
00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:33.040
to be in gratitude, to ask for what we want

342
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.040
in a, of the divine, in a more thoughtful, reflective way?

343
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.373
<v ->But also to step out of the way,</v>

344
00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:46.021
and have the humility to know that we're not the doers.

345
00:16:46.021 --> 00:16:48.111
And I think that--

346
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:49.103
<v Voiceover>That's big.</v>

347
00:16:49.103 --> 00:16:50.287
That's big in western culture.

348
00:16:50.287 --> 00:16:51.077
<v ->A difficult thing.</v>

349
00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:52.826
It's a very difficult thing, but in truth,

350
00:16:52.826 --> 00:16:57.327
much of what we think we want comes of from our small mind.

351
00:16:57.327 --> 00:17:01.060
It's not from what would be our highest option.

352
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.927
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about a couple</v>

353
00:17:02.927 --> 00:17:06.009
of clients you can think of, right off hand,

354
00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:09.240
that had incredible experiences of stepping

355
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.792
out of their way after they built their alter.

356
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:17.058
<v ->Well, one of them was my daughter.</v>

357
00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:19.245
I'll just give it a home example.

358
00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:22.498
She was, she had decided to go to law school

359
00:17:22.498 --> 00:17:27.498
but was very young and looking at going to law school at 20.

360
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.641
And felt like she was needing some support

361
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:35.169
and didn't really know where to turn.

362
00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:38.187
So we built an alter, specifically for

363
00:17:38.187 --> 00:17:40.513
helpful people to come into her life.

364
00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:44.672
And it seemed by accident, that at a lunch,

365
00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:47.339
Mike met a woman who happened to be a graduate

366
00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:49.899
of the law school that she had decided to go to

367
00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:54.101
and was very connected with that law school still,

368
00:17:54.101 --> 00:17:56.725
and introduced her to the dean and all the professors

369
00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:59.626
and kind of got her a mentor right on campus

370
00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.877
to help her so that she would be able

371
00:18:01.877 --> 00:18:03.925
to have support selecting the appropriate

372
00:18:03.925 --> 00:18:06.122
teachers and classes that she needed,

373
00:18:06.122 --> 00:18:08.980
and to also find her a job right there on campus.

374
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.889
<v Voiceover>So, the law school angel showed up.</v>

375
00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.724
<v ->It was a perfect situation for her.</v>

376
00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:17.044
But also, many people, I get phone calls and emails

377
00:18:17.044 --> 00:18:19.433
all the time from people who have

378
00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:21.939
experienced the feeling of being

379
00:18:21.939 --> 00:18:23.817
in power for the first time in their lives.

380
00:18:23.817 --> 00:18:24.915
<v Voiceover>Can you give us just one more,</v>

381
00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:26.931
one or two more juicy examples

382
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:29.534
of someone who really felt kind of down and out

383
00:18:29.534 --> 00:18:31.485
and just starting turning things around?

384
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.637
I love these stories.

385
00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:36.594
<v ->Well, one that I, that always comes to mind is the first</v>

386
00:18:36.594 --> 00:18:39.378
alter that I ever did as part of my graduate work

387
00:18:39.378 --> 00:18:41.693
with some friends up the street from where we lived

388
00:18:41.693 --> 00:18:44.786
and we built an abundance alter in their bedroom

389
00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:47.986
and I said to them, "Just call me next weekend,

390
00:18:47.986 --> 00:18:49.660
"let me know how it's going."

391
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.344
And the next day they called and, out of nowhere,

392
00:18:53.344 --> 00:18:56.416
people that they had sold a piece of property to

393
00:18:56.416 --> 00:19:00.362
that had, that was on the floodplains in an area

394
00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:04.760
that flooded a lot, the time they sold the property,

395
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.381
they told the new buyers that if you have anybody

396
00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.397
that ever wants to buy this piece of property,

397
00:19:11.397 --> 00:19:13.861
we'd like to get a cut, a percentage,

398
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.367
because we're giving this, basically, to you.

399
00:19:16.367 --> 00:19:19.663
And 15 years later, they had called the very next day,

400
00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:22.404
after the alter was built, that said they had a check

401
00:19:22.404 --> 00:19:25.913
for fifteen thousand dollars and it went on every day.

402
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.115
For the next two months, they were calling me,

403
00:19:30.115 --> 00:19:32.622
telling me these phenomenal events had happened

404
00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:36.088
and by the time two months was done,

405
00:19:36.088 --> 00:19:38.264
they were flying to LA to buy a house.

406
00:19:38.264 --> 00:19:41.560
One became a screen-writer, the other became

407
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.696
an executive in Joel's Clearwater project.

408
00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:46.722
<v Voiceover>This is about, this is in the category</v>

409
00:19:46.722 --> 00:19:48.877
of the small, not-so-small miracles.

410
00:19:48.877 --> 00:19:51.405
<v ->Not-so-small miracles, but you know,</v>

411
00:19:51.405 --> 00:19:55.820
we, we, when we go in and do people's homes and offices

412
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.882
we usually do build an alter for something

413
00:19:58.882 --> 00:20:00.695
that they really are working on.

414
00:20:00.695 --> 00:20:04.268
And the alters that we talk about are directionally placed,

415
00:20:04.268 --> 00:20:07.265
so there are eight different aspirations

416
00:20:07.265 --> 00:20:09.825
that people are usually drawn to,

417
00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:12.929
like good health, or better relationships,

418
00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:15.670
or their job and career desires,

419
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.199
or abundance and you know, those are areas

420
00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:22.891
that most people have issues with.

421
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:26.005
So we always build an alter to support that desire

422
00:20:26.005 --> 00:20:28.192
and change occurs.

423
00:20:28.192 --> 00:20:30.389
It's not an unusual thing.

424
00:20:31.469 --> 00:20:33.674
<v Voiceover>Can we talk about a few specifics</v>

425
00:20:33.674 --> 00:20:35.690
while we look at some images now,

426
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.732
for example, what would be some of the traits

427
00:20:39.732 --> 00:20:42.218
of an alter for prosperity?

428
00:20:42.218 --> 00:20:45.652
<v ->Well, the color for prosperity is green</v>

429
00:20:45.652 --> 00:20:47.721
and a secondary color is gold.

430
00:20:47.721 --> 00:20:50.388
So those colors should be represented on an alter.

431
00:20:51.828 --> 00:20:54.863
So you would have a water element in the northeast.

432
00:20:54.863 --> 00:20:59.398
It could be a fountain or a clear and translucent vase

433
00:20:59.398 --> 00:21:01.559
with fresh, pure water in it.

434
00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:05.330
You could put something living, like a beautiful flower,

435
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.276
we never use dried flowers on an alter, anything dried.

436
00:21:10.426 --> 00:21:12.946
We want the alter to be as alive as your dreams.

437
00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:17.468
In the southeast would be a candle,

438
00:21:18.868 --> 00:21:21.542
preferably a green or gold color.

439
00:21:22.642 --> 00:21:25.323
In the northeast, we have the water,

440
00:21:25.323 --> 00:21:28.203
in the northwest, we have the air element.

441
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:31.126
It could be a standing wind chime, feathers,

442
00:21:32.506 --> 00:21:36.043
incense in the southwest is the Earth element.

443
00:21:36.043 --> 00:21:38.922
It could be rocks, it could be crystals,

444
00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:40.384
anything from nature.

445
00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:44.394
And in the center is an offering bowl or a plate,

446
00:21:44.394 --> 00:21:47.274
something where you would place a distillation

447
00:21:47.274 --> 00:21:50.804
of your highest desire, just in a word or two.

448
00:21:50.804 --> 00:21:52.970
Something that would evoke a feeling.

449
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.988
And in back of all of that, would be

450
00:21:55.988 --> 00:21:57.983
what we call a personal symbol.

451
00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:01.598
It could be anything that represents to you

452
00:22:01.598 --> 00:22:03.348
that personal desire.

453
00:22:03.348 --> 00:22:06.078
One abundance alter we created,

454
00:22:06.078 --> 00:22:10.410
Mike made a great little collage of dollar bills--

455
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.051
<v Voiceover>Oh, this is in your book.</v>

456
00:22:12.051 --> 00:22:14.440
That's perfect.

457
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.227
<v ->And we've made all kinds of different things,</v>

458
00:22:19.507 --> 00:22:22.877
maybe for a health alter, we put all members of the family,

459
00:22:22.877 --> 00:22:25.874
or if it was a relationship alter, and there wasn't

460
00:22:25.874 --> 00:22:29.821
a specific person in your life, maybe pictures

461
00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:32.700
of people that looked happily involved.

462
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.828
Or a lot of women I know, we just

463
00:22:36.828 --> 00:22:39.452
tell them to go through magazines

464
00:22:39.452 --> 00:22:43.494
and pick out faces of people that touch their hearts.

465
00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:46.278
Anything that evokes a deeper emotion,

466
00:22:46.278 --> 00:22:48.209
so that when you look at the alter,

467
00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:51.110
you are touched by its beauty.

468
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.711
The pieces on the alter should touch your heart,

469
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:57.328
because it is that, the essence of love,

470
00:22:57.328 --> 00:23:01.392
that feeds your alter and as you admire and love it

471
00:23:01.392 --> 00:23:04.186
it gains energy from that.

472
00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:07.088
<v Voiceover>And doesn't that essence, or feeling of love,</v>

473
00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:10.522
also generally evoke a sense of humility.

474
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.591
Just intrinsically.

475
00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:13.541
<v Robin>Yes.</v>

476
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.695
Well, one great teacher we know

477
00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:17.604
says that love isn't an emotion

478
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:19.460
it is our very nature.

479
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.553
So, it is everything that permeates

480
00:23:22.553 --> 00:23:25.060
that which is seen and unseen.

481
00:23:26.222 --> 00:23:28.920
<v Voiceover>And your book, which was published</v>

482
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.011
oh, when was it published?

483
00:23:31.011 --> 00:23:32.742
<v Robin>It just came out in October.</v>

484
00:23:32.742 --> 00:23:34.417
<v Voiceover>Just a few, yeah, just a few months ago.</v>

485
00:23:34.417 --> 00:23:38.438
And already, it's receiving acclaim.

486
00:23:38.438 --> 00:23:41.104
It's received, if you wouldn't mind bragging,

487
00:23:41.104 --> 00:23:43.547
just a little bit, tell us about some of the awards

488
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.605
that this book is winning and I can see why,

489
00:23:45.605 --> 00:23:48.443
it's laid out very nicely, very user-friendly, beautiful.

490
00:23:48.443 --> 00:23:51.365
<v Robin>It won Spirituality Book of the Year</v>

491
00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:53.509
from USA Booknews,

492
00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:58.149
and it's a finalist for the Benjamin Franklyn Award

493
00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:01.487
for New Age Book of the Year, as well as

494
00:24:01.487 --> 00:24:03.908
Forward Magazine, Body Mind Spirit

495
00:24:03.908 --> 00:24:07.343
and their Self-Help categories,

496
00:24:07.343 --> 00:24:10.990
and the Nautilus Award for Small Press.

497
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Voiceover>Wow, your first book.</v>

498
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.012
<v ->First book.</v>

499
00:24:15.012 --> 00:24:15.982
<v Voiceover>Self-published,</v>

500
00:24:15.982 --> 00:24:18.585
which I heard you speak the other night

501
00:24:18.585 --> 00:24:20.025
and I love that part of the story,

502
00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:22.467
because I think that's, as an author as well,

503
00:24:22.467 --> 00:24:24.067
an important part of the story,

504
00:24:24.067 --> 00:24:26.339
which is you can wait and wait,

505
00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:28.589
you can throw it out there, you can seem to have

506
00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:31.032
fabulous alliances with big New York publishers,

507
00:24:31.032 --> 00:24:34.840
but in the end, you said, "No, I wanna do it my way."

508
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.554
And you did, and look at that rewards that are coming.

509
00:24:39.554 --> 00:24:43.031
I'm very, I'm very impressed that you had the guts

510
00:24:43.031 --> 00:24:45.634
to walk away from a New York deal

511
00:24:45.634 --> 00:24:47.586
and do it yourself, the right way,

512
00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:50.028
rather than having it compromised.

513
00:24:50.028 --> 00:24:51.927
<v ->Well, I guess it's at a certain point,</v>

514
00:24:51.927 --> 00:24:54.924
it's your vision, it's your dream, it's your baby.

515
00:24:54.924 --> 00:24:58.550
You want it to reflect your love

516
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.241
and I couldn't imagine this book anything but beautiful.

517
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Voiceover>How many alters did you set in place</v>

518
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.902
for this book, the creation of this book?

519
00:25:06.902 --> 00:25:10.688
<v ->There's close to 100 or over 100 colored photos--</v>

520
00:25:10.688 --> 00:25:12.107
<v Voiceover>No, I mean you personally,</v>

521
00:25:12.107 --> 00:25:13.387
to bring this book into fruition.

522
00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:14.382
<v ->Oh!</v>

523
00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:15.776
<v Voiceover>You must have set up</v>

524
00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:17.450
a number of alters on this one.

525
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.882
<v ->Yeah, yup, yes, we had a, in my office,</v>

526
00:25:19.882 --> 00:25:22.783
there was definitely, we had a living alter.

527
00:25:22.783 --> 00:25:26.783
It was the, an alter that continued to evolve

528
00:25:26.783 --> 00:25:29.386
as we went through many stages of the book.

529
00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:33.396
So, the final thing was, on that alter,

530
00:25:33.396 --> 00:25:35.444
was everything to celebrate the fact

531
00:25:35.444 --> 00:25:38.110
that the book was absolutely birthed in a beautiful way

532
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.988
and when it came back from the printer

533
00:25:39.988 --> 00:25:43.497
I had it in hand for Book Expo America

534
00:25:43.497 --> 00:25:45.609
last year in Chicago and that was my goal.

535
00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:49.790
And I was so very proud to actually be able

536
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.555
to show people how beautiful it really looked.

537
00:25:53.555 --> 00:25:54.664
<v Voiceover>It is a beautiful book</v>

538
00:25:54.664 --> 00:25:57.192
and though the ink has barely dried on its pages

539
00:25:57.192 --> 00:25:59.197
it's so new, you're already into your next one.

540
00:25:59.197 --> 00:26:00.349
<v ->Yes.</v>

541
00:26:00.349 --> 00:26:02.567
We've actually, we're in our second printing

542
00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:06.183
and also, we'll have our second book in hand

543
00:26:06.183 --> 00:26:09.159
in just a few months--

544
00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:10.662
<v Voiceover>That's the nice thing about self-publishing.</v>

545
00:26:10.662 --> 00:26:11.708
<v ->Right.</v>

546
00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:14.705
<v Voiceover>Very good, well, congratulations</v>

547
00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:17.030
on all your awards and also thank you

548
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.121
for producing such a lovely work of art

549
00:26:19.121 --> 00:26:20.390
in and of itself.

550
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.802
<v ->Thank you.</v>

551
00:26:24.112 --> 00:26:25.573
<v ->I want to share something with you.</v>

552
00:26:25.573 --> 00:26:27.216
Robin and Michael came to our home

553
00:26:27.216 --> 00:26:29.776
and did a Vastu consultation after we met with them

554
00:26:29.776 --> 00:26:31.418
because we were so impressed with them.

555
00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:33.722
Well, the next day an unexpected gift

556
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:36.271
of $4,500 arrived in the mail.

557
00:26:36.271 --> 00:26:38.394
We were literally blown away.

558
00:26:38.394 --> 00:26:40.527
I just had to share that little bit with you.

559
00:26:40.527 --> 00:26:43.492
Meanwhile, Robin's book, Alters of Power and Grace

560
00:26:43.492 --> 00:26:46.468
is a work of art and her new book will be out shortly.
