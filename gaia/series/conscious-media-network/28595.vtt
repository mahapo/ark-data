00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:02.153
<v ->In a moment you will see what I</v>

2
00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:04.822
and many others consider to be a hero.

3
00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:08.427
She's tiny in stature but bold and courageous in her actions

4
00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:12.030
on behalf of the Earth's record keepers, elephants.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.932
She grew up with elephants in a hill tribe

6
00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:15.333
in Thailand and grew to have an

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.835
extraordinary ability to understand them.

8
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.740
Some even call her the elephant whisperer.

9
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.942
Her mission is to save abused elephants

10
00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:25.343
and her ultimate dream, to return all of Thailand's

11
00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:28.730
elephants to the wild where they belong.

12
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:33.635 line:15% 
(gentle music)

13
00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:37.422
Is it okay to call you Lek?

14
00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:38.123
<v ->Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:40.791
<v Regina>Okay Lek, tell us a little bit about</v>

16
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.895
how you fell in love so deeply with

17
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:45.816
the elephants from such an early age.

18
00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:50.235
<v ->When I young I spend time with elephant</v>

19
00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:54.288
and I never think the time that my family

20
00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:57.542
allow me to stand next to elephant

21
00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:01.012
I feel that elephant is not anymore, I feel they're like us.

22
00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:02.597
I feel that is...

23
00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:05.860
See I is all the time believe

24
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.586
elephant is the person like us.

25
00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:11.922
Because is the way when I was young I get

26
00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:15.159
a nap with the elephant when I was in the jungle.

27
00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.696
I lie down, lean my head on the stomach

28
00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:22.768
of elephant when she sleep in the afternoon is that's,

29
00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:25.669
that's wonderful and I feel very safe.

30
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:28.740
I feel that are very beautiful and gentle.

31
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.111
And I have in my heart I can trust them.

32
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.380
Even, I know that the elephant they have

33
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.247
the feeling with the space and for people

34
00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.116
who is dangerous for them or not dangerous.

35
00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:40.382
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

36
00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:43.355
<v ->This is why I fall in love with elephant because</v>

37
00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:46.258
the first elephant who have show me,

38
00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:49.694
even she a giant but she very gentle

39
00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:52.664
and beautiful heart and that is the way

40
00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:56.318
I first fall in love with elephant.

41
00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.505
<v Regina>As time went on after you went to school</v>

42
00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:03.775
and so forth and you came to do this,

43
00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:06.711
rescue them for a living, tell us about

44
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:09.581
the elephant, the condition of the elephants,

45
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:12.284
when they come to you, what they've been doing,

46
00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:15.020
how they've been trained and what kind of shape

47
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.355
they're in by the time they come to you.

48
00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:20.292
<v ->In the first of all when I have the elephant at home,</v>

49
00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:23.661
I believe all elephant to be happy like the one we have.

50
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.363
And then when I was 16 I have an opportunity

51
00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:29.767
to follow the missionary to the logging area.

52
00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:32.770
At that time, I never used to imagine work

53
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.439
with elephant at all but I dream that there's

54
00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.776
someday I want to have elephant myself.

55
00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:40.612
I went with the missionary because I want to be,

56
00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:44.515
a chance English language with them but when I first

57
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:47.352
saw the elephant, they're working the logging.

58
00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:49.386
I couldn't believe it myself but is,

59
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:52.590
what is my eyes see, elephant are suffering.

60
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.194
They are cut in the neck, know like the rope cut this.

61
00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:58.497
They're forced to do the work, over and over

62
00:02:58.497 --> 00:03:01.099
and then the rope cut deeper and deeper.

63
00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.502
Many of them blind, still work lame, still forced to work

64
00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:07.839
not easily, pull the log from the easy,

65
00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.610
but pull from, pull the log from a steep hill.

66
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.611
<v Regina>They're pulling logs up a steep hill</v>

67
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:16.215
so they use them for harvesting timber.

68
00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:18.416
<v ->Yeah the big timber, some timber is</v>

69
00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:21.385
where it is very nearly to the elephant.

70
00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:24.389
But some of them are lame and broken leg.

71
00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.891
They force the elephant to work not easily,

72
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.762
force them but use a hand, hit them

73
00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:32.731
or use the knife, stab them.

74
00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:35.233
When I saw that you know, I'm shocked,

75
00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:38.419
I couldn't believe my eyes and I just think that it's...

76
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.541
This thing is, I don't even believe that,

77
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:44.275
and then I came back from that trip,

78
00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.545
that picture followed me like a shadow.

79
00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:49.247
And that when it followed me and then

80
00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:53.067
I saw many of them, wounded never, never treat.

81
00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:56.120
So I came back, I start to work and I start to go

82
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.623
and bring the medicine to the jungle, back.

83
00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:01.226
And every time I have enough money to buy medicine.

84
00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:04.296
The more I go in the jungle, the more deeper and deeper,

85
00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:08.232
I found more suffer animal, suffer elephant and that day,

86
00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:11.837
I couldn't turn my back, couldn't turn my back to them.

87
00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:14.540
And then I one day, I talked to my mother,

88
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.910
I said, "mom, I want to rescue the elephant."

89
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.479
Then my mom look at me

90
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.048
with a big question mark in the eyes.

91
00:04:23.048 --> 00:04:25.716
Because for myself, I come from the hill tribe,

92
00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:29.013
Baan Lao, Khmu the Khmu hill tribe.

93
00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:32.667
Forget about education you know,

94
00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:36.377
Khmu woman born to be a wife at home,

95
00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:38.964
look after the kid and work at the farm.

96
00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:42.233
Education, Khmu woman never have time to go and have that.

97
00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:44.369
My mother she never have educate,

98
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:46.570
she pushed me to go and have education,

99
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.208 line:15% 
I'm a first generation at our family, at our village,

100
00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:52.710 line:15% 
the first woman who come out for study.

101
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.546 line:15% 
So when I walk back and tell to my mother

102
00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:58.282
I want to rescue elephant, my mother look at me,

103
00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:00.651
she didn't say any word but she smile.

104
00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:04.981
I know her smile mean, no way baby, but I said to her,

105
00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:07.698
I said, "you might ask me how."

106
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:10.915
I said "do you, I don't know yet today

107
00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:14.983
"but I think I can and I will," I never doubt my dream.

108
00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:18.303
The more I go and more I fall in love with them.

109
00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:21.506
I never doubt my dream, from a zero background,

110
00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:24.275
I have so many friend around the world who come

111
00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:27.246
to work with me volunteer, they fill my dream.

112
00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:30.048
All the visitor who come every day now

113
00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:33.147
to come give and put money for the project.

114
00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:36.588
I put the money to the elephant and as...

115
00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:38.989
You know, I start to work my own business,

116
00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.359
before I was start the sanctuary,

117
00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:43.829
I decide to go and do the business

118
00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:47.332
and I have enough money to go and support project.

119
00:05:47.332 --> 00:05:50.434
<v Regina>That's beautiful, that dream</v>

120
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.671
that you have such commitment to.

121
00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:55.105
For how many years now have you been doing this?

122
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.208
<v ->To do for the first temp works but</v>

123
00:05:57.208 --> 00:06:01.171
I did for the first, to go really carry

124
00:06:01.171 --> 00:06:04.348
the medicine back 1985,

125
00:06:04.348 --> 00:06:07.051
to do tempo experience,

126
00:06:07.051 --> 00:06:09.520
Now this mean automatic temp works

127
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.457
but the first elephant I rescue 1982.

128
00:06:12.457 --> 00:06:15.426
Also I have completely the I have like,

129
00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:18.831
the car to go there with, before I used to walk,

130
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.366
and you know, go by bus, walk, motorcy'e,

131
00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:25.737
and hire the porter to carry the medicine.

132
00:06:25.737 --> 00:06:28.539
Later I start to go and buy the old jeep,

133
00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.408
to go to the jungle.
<v Regina>Old jeep yes.</v>

134
00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:32.068
So now you have a car so it makes

135
00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:33.718
it a lot easier (laugh).
<v Lek>I have ya I have a car</v>

136
00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:36.314
Yeah and then we can have more flexibility

137
00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:40.118
to take the mobile clinic, another staff for mobile clinic.

138
00:06:40.118 --> 00:06:43.020
First before I would go to rescue elephant

139
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.509
and when I see the elephant,

140
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:49.994
I have so many, see many elephant, torturing

141
00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:53.530
that elephant but which one I will select?

142
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.685
Now we have people, how I go select the elephant?

143
00:06:57.685 --> 00:07:00.367
What is the standard that we go and choose

144
00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:04.816
which one to be rescue, and we take the most needed.

145
00:07:05.543 --> 00:07:08.579
Like this one broke a leg, she's still forced to work.

146
00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.483
This one both eyes blind is still forced to work.

147
00:07:11.483 --> 00:07:14.686
She's the one I never turn my back.

148
00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:18.489
Some elephant take me five months to go and try to rescue.

149
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.671
The owner play the greedy game,

150
00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:22.993
the owner doesn't want sell this price,

151
00:07:22.993 --> 00:07:26.998
the owner ya know confused, some elephant I use the money.

152
00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:30.668
I use the police to go and help to talk, I use a headman,

153
00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:33.004
It's a take a long-long time to

154
00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:36.269
go and get one elephant back to the park.

155
00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:39.844
<v Regina>That's interesting you, recently you've had</v>

156
00:07:39.844 --> 00:07:42.947
a situation where you had to let two or three of them

157
00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:46.394
go back to the owners and can you talk about

158
00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:49.154
what the owners do with the elephants,

159
00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:51.289
what were the elephants doing before,

160
00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:53.257
and what are they doing again cus I know this

161
00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:55.393
made you all very sad, that they had

162
00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:58.031
to go back after a few years with you.

163
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.499
<v ->Most elephant come from the trekking camp.</v>

164
00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:02.868
<v Regina>Trekking?</v>
<v ->They come to us.</v>

165
00:08:02.868 --> 00:08:06.087
Trekking camp, they come to us because many condition.

166
00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:08.639
most is they have a mental issue.

167
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.109
Many mother elephant kill the baby

168
00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:13.044
the first minute they're born.

169
00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:16.214
I think all around world no one know what going on.

170
00:08:16.214 --> 00:08:20.584
and I used many of them to build case study.

171
00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:25.233
In 2005 we have a very important case to happen,

172
00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:28.326
one elephant can have seven mother,

173
00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:31.884
success birth and they are

174
00:08:31.884 --> 00:08:34.064
give birth in the same year.

175
00:08:34.064 --> 00:08:35.832
<v Regina>Seven mothers gave birth in the same year?</v>

176
00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:37.869
<v ->Seven yes, same year.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

177
00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:40.505
<v ->In one camp only which is very-very unusual</v>

178
00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:43.107
because in the number of 70 elephant

179
00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:46.545
but seven mother have a baby after two year.

180
00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.514
They give birth in 2005,

181
00:08:49.514 --> 00:08:53.618
five mother kill the baby in the first minute the baby drop.

182
00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:55.353
<v Regina>They killed the babies?</v>

183
00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:57.488
<v ->They kill the baby, you will see that mother elephant</v>

184
00:08:57.488 --> 00:09:00.798
they love the baby, they kill the baby, five mother

185
00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:04.578
kill the baby but the two mother mean seven give birth,

186
00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:07.099
five mother kill, success to kill the baby,

187
00:09:07.099 --> 00:09:10.672
when the baby drop, one second the mother take the baby,

188
00:09:10.672 --> 00:09:13.871
bang and kill, the two mother doesn't mean

189
00:09:13.871 --> 00:09:16.341
mother doesn't want to kill, she try to kill but

190
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:18.242
the Mahout stab with the knife.

191
00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:20.711
Rescue two baby, even they put the baby

192
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:23.615
in the trolley and run, the mother try to pull the chain,

193
00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:26.318
grab the baby want to kill the baby.

194
00:09:26.318 --> 00:09:27.719
This is--

195
00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:30.021
<v Regina>That's not normal elephant behavior.</v>

196
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:33.524
<v ->Yeah, as I work with elephant, as I do</v>

197
00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:35.460
the case study with the wild elephant,

198
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.129
I spent years and years with the wild elephant

199
00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:41.489
in the jungle, I found out it's very unusual.

200
00:09:41.489 --> 00:09:45.619
So I decide to go and ask the owner to allow me,

201
00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:49.340
permission me to go and use to be a case study.

202
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.676
Every mother, seven of the mother pregnant.

203
00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.681
Never normal reproduce, no natural, nature.

204
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:01.345
They force the mother, I show you a photo tomorrow.

205
00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:04.973
They tie the mother on the tree

206
00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:09.477
and force the...

207
00:10:11.362 --> 00:10:15.199
the mother, tie the leg and the man have a knife,

208
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:18.736
to threaten the mother stab, stab for in her.

209
00:10:18.736 --> 00:10:20.370
And then let the--

210
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Regina>Why were they stabbing the mother?</v>

211
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.775
<v ->To force the bull on to rape her.</v>

212
00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:26.911
<v Regina>Oh to, it's almost like a rape.</v>

213
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:29.580
<v ->Breeding program call breeding program.</v>

214
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.616
Some elephant will stay with us, some of them

215
00:10:31.616 --> 00:10:34.685
pass to get program 40 time

216
00:10:34.685 --> 00:10:37.889
and now when they stay in the park they become

217
00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:40.525
mental issue, they walk like a zombie.

218
00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:42.960
When they see the bull, you could see that

219
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.530
the bull next to them, they pee right away, they couldn't

220
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.148
stand that.
<v Regina>They're frightened.</v>

221
00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:48.365
<v ->They are they're frightened.</v>

222
00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:50.902
They're not allowed the bull to touch them at all.

223
00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:53.070
We have to take some of them, never

224
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.573
never allow other bull to go and touch them again.

225
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.507
<v Regina>So they really, they forced reproduction</v>

226
00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:04.348
on the female and she became mentally unstable,

227
00:11:04.348 --> 00:11:07.718
and then when the baby's born she wants nothing

228
00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:10.221
to do with the baby, is that what you've got?

229
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:13.857
<v ->Yeah, I'll tell you, let her, why they want a baby?</v>

230
00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:17.661
They make the female elephant to have a baby,

231
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:21.215
because for the breeding program is a baby elephant

232
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:24.441
a lot of benefit to the camp.

233
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:28.179
When I have follow, I follow every case.

234
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.677
The life of the killed baby, that elephant no suffer

235
00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:36.413
it know, so they stand up eye empty

236
00:11:36.413 --> 00:11:40.117
they didn't know them self, they are the elephant.

237
00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:42.486
Even the mother who have two baby elephant

238
00:11:42.486 --> 00:11:46.024
never accept the baby again and in my opinion,

239
00:11:46.024 --> 00:11:50.061
after I work, follow that case, I think that

240
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:54.165
all the elephant nature like, I think a life unavoidable.

241
00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:57.368
If they see that the life of them not so safe,

242
00:11:57.368 --> 00:12:00.538
I don't want that baby life then, they decide to kill them.

243
00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:03.107
<v Regina>Yes, that's what I was wondering is if they</v>

244
00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:06.077
intuitively know it's not a safe world for that baby.

245
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:09.931
<v ->Yeah this is only my opinion, I can't just say about this.</v>

246
00:12:10.791 --> 00:12:12.465
<v Regina>No that's why I was thinking that</v>

247
00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:16.054
when you were talking, that they seem to have such a

248
00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:20.707
a delicate sense of life.

249
00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:22.379
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

250
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:26.780
<v ->When you ask me why I have leased the elephant.</v>

251
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.632
When this elephant--

252
00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:30.601
<v Regina>You're talking about a leasing program,</v>

253
00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.010
where you lease the elephants from...

254
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.006
<v ->The trekking camp (speaker mumbles).</v>

255
00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:36.975
<v Regina>Because why because they have been injured</v>

256
00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:39.643
or they're psychologically troubled, how do you

257
00:12:39.643 --> 00:12:41.779
talk them into leasing the elephant?

258
00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:44.849
<v ->When the mother, some mother pregnancy,</v>

259
00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:47.350
the Mahout know that, the owner of elephant,

260
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.653
they know that if they keep in the trekking camp

261
00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:53.324
they will lose baby, so when they come and talk to me,

262
00:12:53.324 --> 00:12:56.261
"can we leave the elephant with you?"

263
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:59.697
When they start to come, when the pregnancy,

264
00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:01.665
three months before they give birth,

265
00:13:01.665 --> 00:13:03.701
they leave with us, we don't pay anything.

266
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:05.903
We pay Mahout to come stay with us.

267
00:13:05.903 --> 00:13:09.473
We have policy, the Mahout must be the owner only

268
00:13:09.473 --> 00:13:12.543
to come and stay with us and when they stay with us,

269
00:13:12.543 --> 00:13:16.213
we decide to go and use, let when the baby

270
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:19.349
give birth, the baby safe and then after that

271
00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:22.219
Mahout can leave us at least one year.

272
00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:24.789
We use that opportunity to train Mahout

273
00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:27.558
and make them to understand how

274
00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:29.894
to go and positive reinforcement.

275
00:13:29.894 --> 00:13:31.561
But the culture is very--

276
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.731
<v Regina>Is positive reinforcement, yeah.</v>

277
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.833
<v ->We then we start to use one year of our opportunity</v>

278
00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:38.970
to come stay with the baby elephant.

279
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.740
Make sure they trust human because that elephant

280
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.975
not belong to us, one day they will

281
00:13:43.975 --> 00:13:46.278
walk out to work for the tourist industry.

282
00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:48.912
They not fear for people and the people can trust.

283
00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:52.384
Then the owner go train them hard way,

284
00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:55.086
as the other elephant can do so

285
00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:58.489
we use that time to educate the owner of elephant as well.

286
00:13:58.489 --> 00:14:00.624
To go and make sure that they are there

287
00:14:00.624 --> 00:14:03.428
and when they have to leave, stay away from us.

288
00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:07.364
That baby elephant feel more pain from the training.

289
00:14:07.364 --> 00:14:09.833
That's why we go and do now.

290
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:13.404
It's just painful to see them, have a very

291
00:14:13.404 --> 00:14:16.840
freedom, life in the park and walk out

292
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.409
and go and become the slave working.

293
00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:21.812
Very confuse for the elephant as well.

294
00:14:21.812 --> 00:14:24.548
But we have no choice you know,

295
00:14:24.548 --> 00:14:26.950
One choice send over the first time

296
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.453
and that elephant wants a life

297
00:14:29.453 --> 00:14:31.421
and the mother kill the baby again

298
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.457
or we accept them and then I have use

299
00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:36.410
this opportunity to educate them.

300
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:40.498
<v Regina>When this happened recently and the elephants</v>

301
00:14:40.498 --> 00:14:43.033
went back to the trekking company,

302
00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:46.304
I was reading on your website that it was

303
00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:48.873
emotionally very troubling for the elephant

304
00:14:48.873 --> 00:14:51.142
one of the elephants. they knew what was going on.

305
00:14:51.142 --> 00:14:53.110
<v ->Yeah you know that she didn't</v>

306
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.445
want to leave and all this screaming,

307
00:14:55.445 --> 00:14:59.906
it's so tragic and it bring a tear to us

308
00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:03.954
after they take her to train,

309
00:15:03.954 --> 00:15:06.323
she falling down, the leathers,

310
00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:08.492
we not even put her in the leather yet.

311
00:15:08.492 --> 00:15:10.860
She falling down after training

312
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.797
and they have to take her to the hospital.

313
00:15:13.797 --> 00:15:16.301
We can now rescue her from the hospital

314
00:15:16.301 --> 00:15:19.269
back to the park, unbelievable.

315
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:22.653
When she arrive all the hurt will come her.

316
00:15:23.083 --> 00:15:24.775
<v Regina>All the what it would to her?</v>

317
00:15:24.775 --> 00:15:26.176
<v ->All the hurt will...</v>

318
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.928
<v Regina>All the hurt comes to her, yes.</v>

319
00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:31.615
<v ->It will come her but she is totally change like that.</v>

320
00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:36.236
Is take time and is break my heart.

321
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:40.157
Is not all elephant that be like her,

322
00:15:40.157 --> 00:15:43.227
to come back to stay with the herd again.

323
00:15:43.227 --> 00:15:46.497
But to see totally different, she start to talk.

324
00:15:46.497 --> 00:15:50.100
Talk to the other one to tell her experience.

325
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.169
What going on with her during the owner take her.

326
00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:56.173
She refused to leave, that's why she collapsed.

327
00:15:56.173 --> 00:15:58.409
And they bring her to the hospital.

328
00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:00.810
And the owner is not able stabilize her

329
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.548
because she freedom, bring her to over there,

330
00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:07.151
try to chain her try to go and make her do the trick,

331
00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:10.053
she can't accept, when she come back,

332
00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:12.857
today you know she listen to me

333
00:16:12.857 --> 00:16:16.093
she listen to my, me as a woman who stay with her

334
00:16:16.093 --> 00:16:18.963
and never beat her and never train her.

335
00:16:18.963 --> 00:16:20.931
But Mahout that will train her in the village.

336
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:22.866
Now she refuse to listen to him.

337
00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:24.634
<v Regina>When you say Mahout, what is Mahout?</v>

338
00:16:24.634 --> 00:16:27.704
<v ->The owner, the owner who take her to train.</v>

339
00:16:27.704 --> 00:16:30.007
She not listen to, when she stay with us,

340
00:16:30.007 --> 00:16:32.876
she refuse him, she start to refuse him and

341
00:16:32.876 --> 00:16:35.713
against him just swing the trunk everywhere.

342
00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:38.432
But when she come to us so gentle, she like to

343
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:41.001
put the head, lean and just put the eye down,

344
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.734
just mommy help me and now any conversation

345
00:16:44.734 --> 00:16:47.825
with the owner please let her us, back to us.

346
00:16:47.825 --> 00:16:50.295
She not listen to him and you can see

347
00:16:50.295 --> 00:16:52.596
tomorrow show, she was how different.

348
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:55.465
She now she not confident like the one

349
00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:58.569
she left before we take her everything

350
00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:01.921
when she come back she become mental.

351
00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:03.790
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->So sad.</v>

352
00:17:04.542 --> 00:17:07.144
<v Regina>What are some of the other, besides trekking,</v>

353
00:17:07.144 --> 00:17:09.213
do they have elephants that they train

354
00:17:09.213 --> 00:17:11.682
for circuses and other things to?

355
00:17:11.682 --> 00:17:14.919
Or is it mostly all the trekking and the logging industries?

356
00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.522
<v ->I rescue from the circus, I rescue</v>

357
00:17:17.522 --> 00:17:20.691
from street begging, I rescue from the logging.

358
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:23.260
One at the circus when I first rescue her,

359
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.329
her name is Faa Sai, they chain her,

360
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.995
Shackle her on the small room, beaten her,

361
00:17:29.995 --> 00:17:34.128
and one day she stopped eat.

362
00:17:34.128 --> 00:17:36.540
She starve to death and in the owner know that

363
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.109
they were lost when I first found her

364
00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:42.046
she have the tie the leg and she jump

365
00:17:42.046 --> 00:17:44.681
all around like a kangaroo all around the room.

366
00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:48.804
When the owner get the food she grab the food, smack it.

367
00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:51.555
And her eye were going to blind,

368
00:17:51.555 --> 00:17:53.823
I start to conversation with the owner

369
00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.193
and I want to rescue and the owner first,

370
00:17:56.193 --> 00:17:58.730
"oh this elephant only three and a half years old

371
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.699
"we still make money," but somehow they give up

372
00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:05.168
I get the food for her she don't accept the food from me.

373
00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:08.539
Her angry is over and like too much.

374
00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:11.776
She couldn't see the human is her friend.

375
00:18:11.776 --> 00:18:14.178
So when I take her to the park,

376
00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:16.714
we release her off of the chain,

377
00:18:16.714 --> 00:18:18.682
she couldn't use her leg, every time

378
00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.918
when she walk fell over, other baby elephant

379
00:18:20.918 --> 00:18:23.488
to take her to run, she kick her on because,

380
00:18:23.488 --> 00:18:25.555
<v Regina>She wasn't used to walking.</v>

381
00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:28.558
<v ->She have freedom leg but she use her leg</v>

382
00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:31.195
like that kick her own leg all the time.

383
00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:34.965
Some day she turn, she decide to like that

384
00:18:34.965 --> 00:18:39.003
and screaming like I give up, I don't want anymore.

385
00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:41.838
We take her a long time and all the herd

386
00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:44.375
we let her free from the herd and the herd try healing her

387
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:48.314
touch her, comfort her it's beautiful to see

388
00:18:48.314 --> 00:18:52.362
the way is the adopt mother treat her

389
00:18:52.362 --> 00:18:54.684
and they take her to the mud bath.

390
00:18:54.684 --> 00:18:57.720
When she went to the mud bath, other baby elephant

391
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.824
climb up to the mud bank, river bank.

392
00:19:00.824 --> 00:19:03.828
She stand up and see, wow they use the leg.

393
00:19:03.828 --> 00:19:06.264
Suddenly I saw that she put two leg together

394
00:19:06.264 --> 00:19:08.599
and jump like she had the

395
00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:10.101
<v Regina>Shackles.</v>
<v ->Yeah</v>

396
00:19:10.101 --> 00:19:12.903
In her leg she got confident to use her leg like that.

397
00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:15.573
She do it she use it three and half year.

398
00:19:15.573 --> 00:19:18.642
She will use that to jump, traumatized.

399
00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:21.178
I think it still in her mind.

400
00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:24.481
Take a long time, today she start to happy.

401
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:26.750
Then when we rescue any baby elephant

402
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.052
who come from abuse to the park

403
00:19:29.052 --> 00:19:31.354
and that baby screaming and talk,

404
00:19:31.354 --> 00:19:33.957
she was the one who most understand.

405
00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:36.660
She would try comfort and kiss them,

406
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.097
stay with that baby for weeks, and talking.

407
00:19:40.097 --> 00:19:44.134
And talk low, soft to that baby elephant.

408
00:19:44.134 --> 00:19:47.604
It's beautiful you know and the other baby elephant

409
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:51.708
is Paa Chan, never pass Paa Chan she come along

410
00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:55.479
and touch and walk away she not really feel.

411
00:19:55.479 --> 00:19:58.915
Mostly I found that the elephant who get passed abuse

412
00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:00.651
will understand each other.

413
00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:02.320
<v Regina>Yes, yes they understand,</v>

414
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.022
like people who've been through abuse

415
00:20:04.022 --> 00:20:06.224
understand other who have been abused.

416
00:20:06.224 --> 00:20:09.627
There's something that goes around the internet,

417
00:20:09.627 --> 00:20:12.230
a video that's been going around the internet,

418
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.066
showing an elephant painting with its trunk.

419
00:20:16.634 --> 00:20:20.237
Everybody sees this and thinks, "oh they're so beautiful

420
00:20:20.237 --> 00:20:22.173
"look how intelligent the elephant is."

421
00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:25.642
But then we heard later that there maybe

422
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.845
some abuse going on in training the elephants to do this.

423
00:20:28.845 --> 00:20:31.181
What's really going on with that program?

424
00:20:31.181 --> 00:20:33.583
<v ->It's a lot of, a lot of thing is.</v>

425
00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.619
Normally I work for the elephant,

426
00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:39.957
I see is what happen and the training

427
00:20:39.957 --> 00:20:43.694
for the baby elephant, when they start to work

428
00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:46.229
from the first time, the baby elephant

429
00:20:46.229 --> 00:20:49.366
will go and first to grab the brush.

430
00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:50.534
<v Regina>Grab what?</v>

431
00:20:50.534 --> 00:20:52.385
<v ->Grab the brush first.</v>

432
00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:54.437
<v Regina>The brush yes okay.</v>

433
00:20:56.097 --> 00:20:59.208
<v ->I was in that proceed before.</v>

434
00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:02.846
I have a company from America come along.

435
00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.983
They're expert on elephant painting.

436
00:21:05.983 --> 00:21:08.718
Because I work with elephant and I want to be with them,

437
00:21:08.718 --> 00:21:10.722
I want to learn, I don't refuse for that,

438
00:21:10.722 --> 00:21:13.290
I want to go and see what going on.

439
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.255
And then when they start to go and force them

440
00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:17.828
many of them they don't force them,

441
00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:20.063
when they get the brush elephant

442
00:21:20.063 --> 00:21:22.099
use the brush broken put on the feet.

443
00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:23.701
<v Regina>Oh they stomp on it.</v>

444
00:21:23.701 --> 00:21:25.986
<v ->Yeah stomp and break it and chewing,</v>

445
00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:27.370
throw away through the head.

446
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.440
This is the thing happen, some people

447
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.843
will go and train they give up, nature of elephant

448
00:21:32.843 --> 00:21:35.179
no way they're gonna get that.

449
00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:38.698
and later the force start

450
00:21:39.283 --> 00:21:41.551
they will go and start to really

451
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:45.423
start and go and stab if that baby elephant not listen.

452
00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:47.492
Some baby try to find that because

453
00:21:47.492 --> 00:21:49.660
they pass from that person and that person

454
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.496
give up and new people start to come and train

455
00:21:52.496 --> 00:21:55.432
but when they start to train, I think I better

456
00:21:55.432 --> 00:21:58.068
show you a picture, I can't explain on this.

457
00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.671
And also I recommend you to go see

458
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:04.975
how some place use the baby elephant to paint.

459
00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:08.979
When you go and film it, don't stay in the audience side,

460
00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:11.950
you have to stay other side, know when the trekking,

461
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.285
when the camp they show you, they always have elephants

462
00:22:15.285 --> 00:22:18.623
stand and they stand here, the man who is the other side,

463
00:22:18.623 --> 00:22:21.893
all on this side, the man who put the nail under here.

464
00:22:21.893 --> 00:22:23.661
<v Regina>A nail?</v>

465
00:22:23.661 --> 00:22:25.862
<v ->Yeah under here, and all the time</v>

466
00:22:25.862 --> 00:22:27.764
that baby elephant will pee before they paint.

467
00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:29.132
<v Regina>They pee?</v>

468
00:22:29.132 --> 00:22:31.602
<v ->They pee they can't control themself.</v>

469
00:22:31.602 --> 00:22:33.904
They know that right away I have to paint.

470
00:22:33.904 --> 00:22:36.907
It's beautiful if you see the elephant painting,

471
00:22:36.907 --> 00:22:41.311
it's amazing, but if you investigation behind,

472
00:22:41.311 --> 00:22:44.881
you will know that it's what really behind it.

473
00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:47.283
<v Regina>Yes they're being forced to do this.</v>

474
00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:49.653
<v ->Even me when if I see that, I don't blame the people</v>

475
00:22:49.653 --> 00:22:51.955
who buy elephant painting or the people who

476
00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:54.324
go and do the business on elephant painting,

477
00:22:54.324 --> 00:22:56.192
if they didn't know that but if the people

478
00:22:56.192 --> 00:22:58.463
know for that they would never do that.

479
00:22:58.463 --> 00:23:02.366
Because for myself I have many conversationalist friend,

480
00:23:02.366 --> 00:23:05.468
who work around the world, when they see that painting,

481
00:23:05.468 --> 00:23:08.872
in the documentary or in the website,

482
00:23:08.872 --> 00:23:11.743
they writing me they said that's amazing,

483
00:23:11.743 --> 00:23:14.377
how intelligent what the animal can do

484
00:23:14.377 --> 00:23:17.280
because they don't show all, or even the people who

485
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.183
want to do that they sent only that picture,

486
00:23:20.183 --> 00:23:22.552
elephant painting, the trunk on elephant

487
00:23:22.552 --> 00:23:25.055
but who know behiind, before that.

488
00:23:25.055 --> 00:23:28.121
And this can be I think the time for us to stop it.

489
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:30.059
Elephant painting not necessary.

490
00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:32.212
<v Regina>That's why I wanted to ask you because there's</v>

491
00:23:32.212 --> 00:23:35.637
a lot of confusion because people are so enamored

492
00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:38.856
with the intelligence of the elephant

493
00:23:38.856 --> 00:23:41.160
and I had heard that there was a lot of cruelty

494
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.425
and thank you for clarifying that,

495
00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:48.112
what is your after all these years of living

496
00:23:48.112 --> 00:23:51.298
with the elephants and being with them,

497
00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:54.657
how do you see them as a spirit?

498
00:23:54.657 --> 00:23:57.884
First let me say this, one of the things I know you're

499
00:23:57.884 --> 00:24:02.432
trying to do is stop the practice of crushing the spirit

500
00:24:02.432 --> 00:24:07.183
of the animal and this is a 6,000 year old practice.

501
00:24:07.183 --> 00:24:10.733
What happens when you break the spirit

502
00:24:10.733 --> 00:24:14.719
of the elephant how do they do this, what do they do?

503
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:19.610
<v ->They take the baby separate from the mother.</v>

504
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.246
When they take the mother, the baby away.

505
00:24:23.246 --> 00:24:25.349
They make sure because the bond between

506
00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:27.484
mother and baby is so strong other you

507
00:24:27.484 --> 00:24:30.519
they're stronger than human can be.

508
00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.956
The mother can die for the baby.

509
00:24:32.956 --> 00:24:35.159
Also not just the mother, the nanny.

510
00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:37.461
<v Regina>And aunties and the nanny.</v>

511
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:40.063
<v ->And everyone, you can see from us</v>

512
00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:43.700
simple is not wild elephant, just see that the

513
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.805
elephant in the sanctuary who get abused

514
00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:50.807
and have mental when they join together.

515
00:24:50.807 --> 00:24:53.277
The way they show they're not freedom like a jungle,

516
00:24:53.277 --> 00:24:55.845
you can see the bond in the wild.

517
00:24:55.845 --> 00:24:57.748
Even more stronger than that,

518
00:24:57.748 --> 00:25:00.084
so when they come into captivity

519
00:25:00.084 --> 00:25:04.121
human also can take some part of the suppression.

520
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:08.325
But they can take some part of the elephant habitat.

521
00:25:08.325 --> 00:25:11.996
But when the human want to break the bond

522
00:25:11.996 --> 00:25:15.666
between mother and baby, they have to make sure that

523
00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:18.902
the mother and baby, the baby forget the mother.

524
00:25:18.902 --> 00:25:21.972
The way they train I also will show you in documentary.

525
00:25:21.972 --> 00:25:25.575
The way they train they're beaten, abused

526
00:25:25.575 --> 00:25:27.677
by these seven day in the training crush

527
00:25:27.677 --> 00:25:29.479
until the baby totally insane.

528
00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:30.880
<v Regina>Seven days in what?</v>

529
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.082
<v ->Seven days in the training crush.</v>

530
00:25:33.082 --> 00:25:35.753
<v Regina>The crush is where they train them</v>

531
00:25:35.753 --> 00:25:38.522
and they beat them, cus I saw the word crush many times,

532
00:25:38.522 --> 00:25:40.824
and I assumed that might be what it is.

533
00:25:40.824 --> 00:25:44.994
That's a training pit or camp or something or room, chamber?

534
00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:48.532
<v ->They have a station for that and this is the,</v>

535
00:25:48.532 --> 00:25:50.801
they prepare for the baby elephant.

536
00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:54.671
But after the abuse, totally baby fear.

537
00:25:56.341 --> 00:26:00.110
He is emotional and everything you know.

538
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.414
The baby they fear for human, they forget the mother.

539
00:26:04.414 --> 00:26:06.749
I couldn't believe I saw that is when the mother

540
00:26:06.749 --> 00:26:09.219
walk passed the baby, come and touch the baby,

541
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:13.656
That baby eye look at the mother, don't know mother at all.

542
00:26:13.656 --> 00:26:17.928
After seven day, the baby look at the mother in front empty.

543
00:26:17.928 --> 00:26:20.029
<v Regina>Cus they're so traumatized.</v>

544
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:23.500
<v ->Yes, and that is so sad and 40%</v>

545
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.336
of baby die in training crush.

546
00:26:26.336 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Regina>That makes sense, absolutely broken spirit</v>

547
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.225
broken heart, no reason to live.

548
00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:32.992
<v ->The baby...</v>

549
00:26:33.478 --> 00:26:35.529
I have work with it,

550
00:26:35.945 --> 00:26:40.326
I saw one baby that make me feel guilty.

551
00:26:41.586 --> 00:26:43.976
I found that baby elephant because

552
00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:46.389
in Thailand we have no law, to see the baby

553
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:50.194
elephant training, you can't complain to anyone.

554
00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:54.013
I saw that baby train and then

555
00:26:54.597 --> 00:26:56.833
I thought the next day the baby sleep.

556
00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:59.369
I found out the baby die in the crush.

557
00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:02.705
When I see the baby train, night before I will see the baby,

558
00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:06.576
she use a trunk to pull my arm and I could look her eye

559
00:27:06.576 --> 00:27:09.746
She just said please help me, I told her I said,

560
00:27:09.746 --> 00:27:13.699
"baby I will take this picture to go and help you.

561
00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:16.320
"I will go and help you I promise that.

562
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.256
"Please be patient, you freedom for the next couple day,

563
00:27:20.256 --> 00:27:24.730
"be strong I will you use my picture to speak for you."

564
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.022
And the next I visit her she lie down and die.

565
00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:32.418
She pull my arm, please help,

566
00:27:33.102 --> 00:27:35.978
it's follow me I feel guilty on that,

567
00:27:35.978 --> 00:27:38.408
I feel that why I don't help her.

568
00:27:38.408 --> 00:27:41.045
Why don't pull her out, why I don't do,

569
00:27:41.045 --> 00:27:43.446
such a man power to help her,

570
00:27:43.446 --> 00:27:45.748
and I feel so angry about that

571
00:27:45.748 --> 00:27:49.286
and I promised myself I will stand up on that

572
00:27:49.286 --> 00:27:52.015
against about this abuse thing.

573
00:27:53.809 --> 00:27:56.826
That's why I stand up speak everyday now.

574
00:27:56.826 --> 00:27:59.629
No more elephants that crush no more elephant painting.

575
00:27:59.629 --> 00:28:03.132
They should out, it's not necessary for human.

576
00:28:03.132 --> 00:28:06.370
<v Regina>It's not necessary, it's a novelty item.</v>

577
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.808
And in truth, if you had people that were kind

578
00:28:10.808 --> 00:28:14.644
and loving to elephants like you are,

579
00:28:14.644 --> 00:28:17.414
won't the elephants very happily be there

580
00:28:17.414 --> 00:28:20.317
and if you need something, would they be willing

581
00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:22.552
to help you if you needed help?

582
00:28:22.552 --> 00:28:24.921
Or is it best, I'm just trying to look at it

583
00:28:24.921 --> 00:28:27.857
in a different way, if they didn't abuse them,

584
00:28:27.857 --> 00:28:30.260
is there a way they could get their cooperation

585
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.763
on certain things in life or, I know they've been used

586
00:28:33.763 --> 00:28:36.566
for thousands of years for work, for pulling logs

587
00:28:36.566 --> 00:28:39.702
and things like that, is there a way

588
00:28:39.702 --> 00:28:43.306
that can be done humanely so they can still work?

589
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:46.242
Or should they just be left alone completely?

590
00:28:46.242 --> 00:28:48.478
<v ->I think is what was happen is</v>

591
00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:50.580
first I talk about tourist industry.

592
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.316
Tourist industry, elephant industry is being

593
00:28:53.316 --> 00:28:57.236
a lot of money for Thailand,

594
00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.576
and then to go and change the idea of this

595
00:29:03.142 --> 00:29:06.596
is like I walk against the wall because

596
00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:08.832
they just say this is the way we make money,

597
00:29:08.832 --> 00:29:11.434
you don't come and tell us what to do.

598
00:29:11.434 --> 00:29:14.304
As well for logging, you know and

599
00:29:14.304 --> 00:29:18.074
I try to go and educate different business

600
00:29:18.074 --> 00:29:21.678
like the tourist industry, I try to do many way.

601
00:29:21.678 --> 00:29:24.947
Like I stand up against cruelty.

602
00:29:24.947 --> 00:29:29.252
Move back to be soft go back again to be their friend.

603
00:29:29.252 --> 00:29:32.889
Elephant industry I work and now I try to work

604
00:29:32.889 --> 00:29:36.159
with the government to work out and try to pull

605
00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:38.428
the baby elephant out from the street.

606
00:29:38.428 --> 00:29:40.263
Theres a lot of thing you can do

607
00:29:40.263 --> 00:29:43.967
but seem very difficult cus money and benefit

608
00:29:43.967 --> 00:29:48.005
they make from elephant is bigger than anything else.

609
00:29:48.005 --> 00:29:52.008
Bigger than one voice like me ever can speak.

610
00:29:52.008 --> 00:29:54.612
Where the government support that.

611
00:29:54.612 --> 00:29:56.579
<v Regina>The what who supports it?</v>

612
00:29:56.579 --> 00:29:58.582
<v ->The government, the government support.</v>

613
00:29:58.582 --> 00:30:01.317
If you can see that now the Thai government

614
00:30:01.317 --> 00:30:04.820
in the Thai TG like Thai highway.

615
00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.056
If you come they show documentary

616
00:30:07.056 --> 00:30:10.760
about elephant painting, promotion.

617
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.595
Tourist authority of Thailand are support

618
00:30:12.595 --> 00:30:14.898
promotion about elephant painting.

619
00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:18.802
Organization like me, when I started go and do that.

620
00:30:18.802 --> 00:30:22.005
My words were written that's why I start

621
00:30:22.005 --> 00:30:24.173
to have the education program,

622
00:30:24.173 --> 00:30:26.209
I believe about education can change

623
00:30:26.209 --> 00:30:28.278
the future of elephant.

624
00:30:28.278 --> 00:30:30.948
We have a volunteer program, this volunteer come

625
00:30:30.948 --> 00:30:35.052
like 20 a week, I have the hope from them.

626
00:30:35.052 --> 00:30:37.853
They will go and help me to speak education,

627
00:30:37.853 --> 00:30:40.290
more friend and family.

628
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.860
And the more we speak out, elephant we save.

629
00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.828
I build everyday, I tell the volunteer,

630
00:30:44.828 --> 00:30:47.898
you will be the friend for elephant for protection.

631
00:30:47.898 --> 00:30:50.667
Everyday when I speak to people,

632
00:30:50.667 --> 00:30:53.670
I believe that I build friend more and more and more.

633
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.538
And I'm the gatekeeper.

634
00:30:55.538 --> 00:30:56.940
<v Regina>Yes absolutely.</v>

635
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.609
<v ->This is I built now, to protect elephant.</v>

636
00:30:59.609 --> 00:31:01.444
This is, I shunned away before,

637
00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:04.048
I used to stand up and fight,

638
00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:07.284
I move back, change my way to go and fight.

639
00:31:07.284 --> 00:31:09.319
<v Regina>Your strategy yes.</v>

640
00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:13.005
Let's talk a little bit about the elephants themselves,

641
00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:15.758
and the magic that you see in the elephants

642
00:31:15.758 --> 00:31:18.127
in observing them all these years

643
00:31:18.127 --> 00:31:21.063
and their finest traits.

644
00:31:21.063 --> 00:31:23.500
<v ->What you mean?</v>

645
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.437
<v Regina>The very best you see the kind of the magical</v>

646
00:31:26.437 --> 00:31:28.538
aspect of being around elephants, the best--

647
00:31:28.538 --> 00:31:31.491
(laugh)

648
00:31:32.128 --> 00:31:35.343
<v ->I have story of how wonderful elephant.</v>

649
00:31:36.346 --> 00:31:39.916
The sorry tale never end but one thing

650
00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:43.653
I see about elephant the love between each other.

651
00:31:43.653 --> 00:31:47.158
Which is I couldn't find from any human being.

652
00:31:47.158 --> 00:31:51.239
When elephant submit to love someone else,

653
00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:54.413
they really love royally.

654
00:31:55.367 --> 00:31:59.025
I have seen like Mae Perm and Jokia the blind elephant.

655
00:31:59.025 --> 00:32:01.705
One all elephant on top the blind elephant

656
00:32:01.705 --> 00:32:04.908
she become the eyes of the blind elephant.

657
00:32:04.908 --> 00:32:08.245
They never apart even Jokia

658
00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:11.449
walk in the field.

659
00:32:11.449 --> 00:32:14.050
And some bug come to her Jokia call Mae Perm.

660
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.220
Sometime Mae Perm she got eyes

661
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.954
she can't see something when she get

662
00:32:17.954 --> 00:32:20.623
just called a little bit, she run.

663
00:32:20.623 --> 00:32:23.726
And taking care and talking, touch each other.

664
00:32:23.726 --> 00:32:26.295
And comfort each other.

665
00:32:26.295 --> 00:32:30.400
One time I found around Jokia have a bunker.

666
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.537
Like a big hole around Jokia,

667
00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:37.840
I surprise why Jokia have dig so many hole around her,

668
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.375
<v Regina>She dug all these holes around her.</v>

669
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:42.378
<v ->Yeah not just a little hole, Mae Perm that's who.</v>

670
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:45.748
He helped to dug make to protect Jokia at night.

671
00:32:45.748 --> 00:32:48.884
When they move her other place, they go and do again.

672
00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:52.288
I wonder what going on, something wrong about it.

673
00:32:52.288 --> 00:32:55.292
During the night they start to grab the grass

674
00:32:55.292 --> 00:32:58.060
and weed put the cover on that

675
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.165
to make sure like that new home.

676
00:33:01.165 --> 00:33:03.399
When I start to go and ask what going on.

677
00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:07.470
I found out Jokia's Mahout fight with the other

678
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.773
Mahout and then other Mahout said--

679
00:33:10.773 --> 00:33:13.643
Mahout is the elephant keeper,

680
00:33:13.643 --> 00:33:16.278
<v Regina>Elephant keepers so Jokia</v>

681
00:33:16.278 --> 00:33:18.414
had fought some elephant keepers?

682
00:33:18.414 --> 00:33:21.484
<v ->No her Mahout her keepers, fight with the other</v>

683
00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:24.721
elephant keepers and then during the,

684
00:33:24.721 --> 00:33:27.425
I'm not here but other one said

685
00:33:27.425 --> 00:33:29.325
"I will avenge you I will come

686
00:33:29.325 --> 00:33:32.162
"and hurt you by stab you elephant."

687
00:33:32.162 --> 00:33:34.230
<v Regina>She was protecting.</v>

688
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.401
<v ->Mae Perm start to build the thing around Jokia.</v>

689
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:40.803
To protect that is elephant come the Mahout

690
00:33:40.803 --> 00:33:44.541
is really scared and after I find out, unbelievable.

691
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:48.145
The way they love each other is amazing.

692
00:33:48.145 --> 00:33:52.358
And one thing I said, the human didn't, not the same

693
00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:55.084
more polite, the more they stay together they're

694
00:33:55.084 --> 00:33:57.921
they're more polite opposite from human.

695
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:01.258
They're polite I see that is, then first

696
00:34:01.258 --> 00:34:03.660
they make the argument thing but lately

697
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.728
when they submit to be friend,

698
00:34:05.728 --> 00:34:07.514
they polite and they love each other

699
00:34:07.514 --> 00:34:09.431
they care to each other.

700
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:12.077
<v Regina>And they help with child rearing with each other?</v>

701
00:34:12.077 --> 00:34:14.637
All of the females come together,

702
00:34:14.637 --> 00:34:18.808
the aunties and the nannies, they all help raise the baby?

703
00:34:18.808 --> 00:34:23.079
<v ->Yeah, and even which I see the great buddy like</v>

704
00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:26.604
one elephant she's a old grandmother, she falling down

705
00:34:26.604 --> 00:34:29.751
four calf, her friends screaming and when we run

706
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.200
to the shelter we saw the friend had pushed her

707
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.211
to lift and when other Mahout come to lift that elephant up,

708
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:36.292
<v Regina>Pushed him up yeah.</v>

709
00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:39.562
<v ->she lift as well and they walk together to the field</v>

710
00:34:39.562 --> 00:34:42.399
and all she shouldn't fell in the shelter,

711
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:43.764
they go and fell in--

712
00:34:43.764 --> 00:34:45.301
<v Regina>Going to fall.</v>

713
00:34:45.301 --> 00:34:48.504
<v ->Yeah fall in the where is the weed and the soft grass.</v>

714
00:34:48.504 --> 00:34:51.441
And during the time when that elephant fell

715
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:53.576
because she old there she not dying--

716
00:34:53.576 --> 00:34:56.112
<v Regina>This is a big deal, when they're old</v>

717
00:34:56.112 --> 00:34:58.914
and they fall down sometimes it's very, very difficult

718
00:34:58.914 --> 00:35:01.217
for them to get back right, and the other elephants

719
00:35:01.217 --> 00:35:02.952
will help them get up?

720
00:35:02.952 --> 00:35:06.622
<v ->Yeah she don't move up, no she get up only in the shelter.</v>

721
00:35:06.622 --> 00:35:09.968
Because of the cement they walk together to the field,

722
00:35:09.968 --> 00:35:12.596
and they fall down and the she stand up

723
00:35:12.596 --> 00:35:14.897
and we try to pull her away because

724
00:35:14.897 --> 00:35:17.299
we don't understand we said come out.

725
00:35:17.299 --> 00:35:19.570
No, we have to bring food for her, even we put the food.

726
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.638
She go and grab the food and bring in front of her friend

727
00:35:22.638 --> 00:35:26.241
and in the hot sun she grab the sand and throw to her friend

728
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:29.680
cover her friend, she want her friend to cool down

729
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.482
and comfort her, we have to bring water to her,

730
00:35:32.482 --> 00:35:35.351
bring food for her, she don't move 12 day.

731
00:35:35.351 --> 00:35:38.087
She don't move 12 day in there.

732
00:35:38.087 --> 00:35:40.991
Normally I want to go in at night

733
00:35:40.991 --> 00:35:44.079
and make her sleep, but I want to see what going on.

734
00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:46.863
They talk to each other...

735
00:35:46.863 --> 00:35:49.681
Amazing day number 13.

736
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:50.900
<v Regina>The what?</v>

737
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.436
<v ->The day number 13, for 12 days she falling down,</v>

738
00:35:54.436 --> 00:35:57.807
number 13 she walk, the friend stand up.

739
00:35:57.807 --> 00:36:01.410
The one won't leave so stand up walk

740
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.714
to the old shelter that's dirt shelter.

741
00:36:04.714 --> 00:36:07.883
Walk there and die, to die in the shelter.

742
00:36:07.883 --> 00:36:09.819
<v Regina>To die in the shelter.</v>

743
00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:12.088
<v ->Because the friend is doing,</v>

744
00:36:12.088 --> 00:36:14.189
she stand in the sun too much,

745
00:36:14.189 --> 00:36:16.826
she walk and die in there, you wouldn't believe it,

746
00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:19.829
every day after that friend dies, she snip, snip

747
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:22.866
wherever they stand together stand up there and mourn.

748
00:36:22.866 --> 00:36:25.334
For long time and after that she die not long after that.

749
00:36:25.334 --> 00:36:27.036
<v Regina>Such loyalty.</v>

750
00:36:27.036 --> 00:36:30.106
<v ->Yeah she die after that and it's heartbreak for us.</v>

751
00:36:30.106 --> 00:36:33.509
She not accept any new friend again but she die after that.

752
00:36:33.509 --> 00:36:35.411
It's so sad.

753
00:36:35.411 --> 00:36:37.746
<v Regina>They were like friends to the end.</v>

754
00:36:38.816 --> 00:36:41.884
What is the highest potential for the friendship

755
00:36:41.884 --> 00:36:44.853
between humans and elephants, it seems that you

756
00:36:44.853 --> 00:36:47.991
exemplify that, they love you, you love them.

757
00:36:47.991 --> 00:36:50.026
Is there a place for friendships

758
00:36:50.026 --> 00:36:51.928
between humans and elephants?

759
00:36:51.928 --> 00:36:54.297
<v ->Yes I think if the human try to do,</v>

760
00:36:54.297 --> 00:36:56.466
but I think the human refuse that.

761
00:36:56.466 --> 00:36:59.168
The human always believe I am the boss.

762
00:36:59.168 --> 00:37:01.704
I think the human build the wall to block.

763
00:37:01.704 --> 00:37:03.339
<v Regina>The build a what?</v>

764
00:37:03.339 --> 00:37:05.908
<v ->They build a wall the wall to block,</v>

765
00:37:05.908 --> 00:37:08.645
between that feeling, between that relationship.

766
00:37:08.645 --> 00:37:10.881
Elephant open the heart for that but

767
00:37:10.881 --> 00:37:13.048
human doesn't accept, human always "I'm better

768
00:37:13.048 --> 00:37:17.078
"than you," human always want to command elephant

769
00:37:17.078 --> 00:37:20.817
and that's so sad because we can,

770
00:37:20.817 --> 00:37:25.261
we can feeling for both side, so elephant not trust human.

771
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:28.330
Most elephant come to the park already

772
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:31.167
they have abuse by men and when they arrive

773
00:37:31.167 --> 00:37:34.370
at the park sometime very difficult for us

774
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.006
to make them trust us again and I'm not blame elephant.

775
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:42.727
Because if you see what is they have been abused.

776
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.030
You will know that these animal are very, very forgive.

777
00:37:48.284 --> 00:37:52.187
For me if I'm young and someone abuse me like that,

778
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:55.125
I won't accept the food from the hand.

779
00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:58.027
I think if people have experience with the tiger bite,

780
00:37:58.027 --> 00:38:00.963
that people will be afraid tiger for life.

781
00:38:00.963 --> 00:38:03.899
Amazing that elephant abuse by man,

782
00:38:03.899 --> 00:38:07.326
elephant come to the park still forgive, except

783
00:38:07.326 --> 00:38:11.573
the other human to go and touch

784
00:38:11.573 --> 00:38:16.395
and feel and that's amazing and also I have example.

785
00:38:17.279 --> 00:38:20.850
I have received the elephant from the trekking

786
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.153
which is the mother is have a mental issue,

787
00:38:24.153 --> 00:38:27.123
and she came with the baby, when she first arrived,

788
00:38:27.123 --> 00:38:29.959
she quite sick and then when her,

789
00:38:29.959 --> 00:38:32.495
we treat her until she get much better

790
00:38:32.495 --> 00:38:35.665
and her baby grow up and then her

791
00:38:35.665 --> 00:38:39.001
she start to reproduce again, with nature

792
00:38:39.001 --> 00:38:41.604
with our bull in there and her baby start

793
00:38:41.604 --> 00:38:43.806
to go and take her milk, mother doesn't want

794
00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:46.397
baby to her milk, she start to want to

795
00:38:46.397 --> 00:38:49.728
put the baby out of the herd, so we

796
00:38:49.728 --> 00:38:52.047
announcement for the new Mahout to come.

797
00:38:52.047 --> 00:38:55.351
Many Mahout come to like interview.

798
00:38:55.351 --> 00:38:58.621
Then I accept one young boy, seem like

799
00:38:58.621 --> 00:39:01.858
he have a lot of experience with elephant.

800
00:39:01.858 --> 00:39:04.727
During that time, this elephant she very friendly.

801
00:39:04.727 --> 00:39:07.629
Every time when the people see her,

802
00:39:07.629 --> 00:39:09.832
she will open the mouth right before,

803
00:39:09.832 --> 00:39:12.468
she open like the hippopotamus ready throw the food.

804
00:39:12.468 --> 00:39:14.270
<v Regina>Like a hippopotamus (laugh).</v>

805
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:18.974
<v ->Then when I give the bread and give the banana to the boy.</v>

806
00:39:18.974 --> 00:39:20.776
Go and see her--

807
00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:22.578
<v Regina>He's giving your banana yeah.</v>

808
00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:24.580
<v ->I give banana for the girl, because to choice,</v>

809
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.749
she love two thing banana and bread.

810
00:39:26.749 --> 00:39:28.317
I said give banana to her first.

811
00:39:28.317 --> 00:39:31.254
When she saw this boy the Mahout,

812
00:39:31.254 --> 00:39:33.589
she closed her mouth and the Mahout said,

813
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:36.292
"oh she doesn't want food, she's not hungry."

814
00:39:36.292 --> 00:39:39.662
I said, "No way, this elephant 24 hour hungry."

815
00:39:39.662 --> 00:39:42.975
I walk to her I said, and then she, I walk to her

816
00:39:42.975 --> 00:39:45.334
with the banana and she open her mouth wide for me

817
00:39:45.334 --> 00:39:48.071
and he said, "because I'm stranger she doesn't

818
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:50.740
"accept from me?" I said "alright I show you."

819
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.343
I call the people who just visit at day time,

820
00:39:53.343 --> 00:39:56.980
one day come stand up and put the banana for them,

821
00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.548
and put the boy in the middle of the line.

822
00:39:59.548 --> 00:40:01.484
Everyone walk she open her mouth for them to put,

823
00:40:01.484 --> 00:40:04.954
when she saw that boy, she closed her mouth.

824
00:40:04.954 --> 00:40:09.658
She not accept, why, and I said tell me.

825
00:40:09.658 --> 00:40:12.877
You know this elephant before? "No I didn't know."

826
00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:15.565
Alright if you didn't know take her to the river.

827
00:40:15.565 --> 00:40:18.301
She have the rope, he put he had to rope her

828
00:40:18.301 --> 00:40:21.470
to take her to river, she pull the rope and run.

829
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.273
Screaming, she not just only screaming,

830
00:40:24.273 --> 00:40:26.442
screaming to other elephant to run

831
00:40:26.442 --> 00:40:28.645
and her including her brother.

832
00:40:28.645 --> 00:40:29.779
<v Regina>Warning them.</v>

833
00:40:29.779 --> 00:40:32.615
<v ->Warning them and I said, "tell me,</v>

834
00:40:32.615 --> 00:40:35.918
"I know elephant never lie, you tell me the truth."

835
00:40:35.918 --> 00:40:38.754
And then I might give you with other job.

836
00:40:38.754 --> 00:40:41.290
He said "yeah if you give me the other elephant,

837
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.360
"I will tell you I know this elephant before."

838
00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.011
I said "how long?"

839
00:40:46.011 --> 00:40:49.507
I know this elephant 12 years ago when she teenage

840
00:40:49.507 --> 00:40:52.680
I was her Mahout and she like to open the mouth.

841
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.239
And he teasing her when he order her to open her mouth,

842
00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:59.509
he grabbed her own poop, throw in her mouth.

843
00:40:59.509 --> 00:41:01.544
<v Regina>He put her poop to her mouth?</v>

844
00:41:01.544 --> 00:41:04.681
So after what a dozen years she remembered

845
00:41:04.681 --> 00:41:08.117
that that boy put poop, her poop in her mouth.

846
00:41:08.117 --> 00:41:10.852
And elephants are renowned for this,

847
00:41:10.852 --> 00:41:14.423
incredible memory that lasts throughout their lives.

848
00:41:14.423 --> 00:41:17.126
First how old do elephants live to be,

849
00:41:17.126 --> 00:41:18.894
what is the lifespan?

850
00:41:18.894 --> 00:41:21.764
<v ->Same human, same human, if they happy.</v>

851
00:41:21.764 --> 00:41:23.499
Some of them can stay for 90 years.

852
00:41:23.499 --> 00:41:24.866
<v Regina>90 years.</v>

853
00:41:24.866 --> 00:41:28.171
<v ->At best 70 to 90 years.</v>

854
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:30.340
<v Regina>What happens to the ones who are abused</v>

855
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.441
and they're over worked and such?

856
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:34.777
<v ->Some of them too bad they stay about 50 years.</v>

857
00:41:34.777 --> 00:41:38.080
You know it depend, many of them falling down,

858
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.749
younger than that and I just have the list.

859
00:41:40.749 --> 00:41:44.736
I just went and visit the elephant graveyard in the cemetery

860
00:41:45.146 --> 00:41:49.151
two days ago, I saw at least 89 elephant

861
00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:54.580
it's average of the age between 3 months to 10 years.

862
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.500
Is a lot of them die and die from,

863
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.471
and the reason is no reason but sickness, starvation,

864
00:42:02.471 --> 00:42:06.658
and a lot of them is no don't know

865
00:42:06.658 --> 00:42:10.996
why they die but I know that it's from human abuse.

866
00:42:12.348 --> 00:42:14.817
It's too bad to see the baby elephant

867
00:42:14.817 --> 00:42:17.019
falling down like that.

868
00:42:17.019 --> 00:42:20.889
<v Regina>So tomorrow we're going to join you</v>

869
00:42:20.889 --> 00:42:24.559
out at the elephant preserve and I can't tell you

870
00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:28.231
how excited we are because you have a new baby,

871
00:42:28.231 --> 00:42:30.933
and this comes right after the loss

872
00:42:30.933 --> 00:42:33.419
of one of the old bulls

873
00:42:33.419 --> 00:42:36.005
and everyone was very sad to lose Max.

874
00:42:36.005 --> 00:42:38.641
<v ->Same day, yeah the baby born the same day</v>

875
00:42:38.641 --> 00:42:41.243
we lost the boy, the other old boy but

876
00:42:41.243 --> 00:42:44.746
Max you know when, Max when I first rescue Max,

877
00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:47.784
it's amazing I have the couple from UK,

878
00:42:47.784 --> 00:42:51.254
want to rescue the elephant and they have the money.

879
00:42:51.254 --> 00:42:54.491
They follow me to Serene Elephants their cause,

880
00:42:54.491 --> 00:42:57.426
they have about 300 elephant marching that field

881
00:42:57.426 --> 00:43:00.462
on that day and many elephant ready to go

882
00:43:00.462 --> 00:43:03.933
and they want to sell away, some of them are beautiful.

883
00:43:03.933 --> 00:43:07.237
Then I saw Max walk very tall like a robot.

884
00:43:07.237 --> 00:43:10.539
Slowly very slowly and skinny.

885
00:43:10.539 --> 00:43:13.242
And I talk to the people who want to help me

886
00:43:13.242 --> 00:43:16.044
to buy elephant I said I want that elephant.

887
00:43:16.044 --> 00:43:18.547
They look at me they said, "that elephant,

888
00:43:18.547 --> 00:43:20.950
"is gonna die next day if you buy."

889
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:25.120
I said "please help me," I want to help that

890
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.291
poor boy, even I take him to the park one day and he die.

891
00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:34.226
I want him to be die dignity and happy, die freedom.

892
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:38.000
I not expect Max to stay with me a year but I expect him

893
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.736

894
00:43:41.736 --> 00:43:45.408

895
00:43:45.408 --> 00:43:47.877
<v Regina>So seven years, six and a half years,</v>

896
00:43:47.877 --> 00:43:50.213
he was with you, how old was he when he died,

897
00:43:50.213 --> 00:43:51.614

898
00:43:51.614 --> 00:43:53.182

899
00:43:53.182 --> 00:43:54.716
<v Regina>75 years old.</v>

900
00:43:54.716 --> 00:43:57.186
<v ->But since we rescue him, everyday</v>

901
00:43:57.186 --> 00:44:00.622
he make me so afraid.

902
00:44:00.622 --> 00:44:03.926
He couldn't wake up in the morning because his legs cannot.

903
00:44:03.926 --> 00:44:05.794
<v Regina>Had bad legs yeah.</v>

904
00:44:05.794 --> 00:44:09.197
<v ->Then one day he walk all around the park,</v>

905
00:44:09.197 --> 00:44:11.900
and he very famous with the girl, all the girl like him.

<v ->Yeah he not aggressive, he gentle.</v>

908
00:44:16.606 --> 00:44:19.308
And he is the one who belongs with the other boy,

909
00:44:19.308 --> 00:44:21.610
so the girl who afraid for the bull,

910
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.312
they start to walk with him because they know he not well.

911

<v Regina>So he was a gentleman, so the girls</v>

912
00:44:27.616 --> 00:44:29.752

these amazing elephants, you can contact Lek's organization

in Chiang Mai, Thailand it's called

942
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.995
the Elephant Nature Park, not to be confused

943
00:50:13.995 --> 00:50:16.198
with all of the other elephant parks

944
00:50:16.198 --> 00:50:18.934
offering trekking, elephant painting and the like.

00:50:18.934 --> 00:50:22.104

00:50:25.624 --> 00:50:27.643
felt particularly honored to be in such close contact

948
00:50:27.643 --> 00:50:30.178
with the baby, now too heavy to play with.
