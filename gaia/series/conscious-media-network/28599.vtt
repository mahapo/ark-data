<v ->Dean Radin was one of those little kids you read about.</v>

2
00:00:02.951 --> 00:00:05.405 line:15% 
A prodigy at music, math, and science

3
00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.860 line:15% 
with an insatiable desire to know everything.

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.303 line:15% 
It was inevitable that he would want to know the answers

5
00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.340 line:15% 
to the big questions such as,

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.046 line:15% 
"What is the thing that motivates

7
00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:17.606 line:15% 
"and binds all of life together?"

8
00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:18.758 line:15% 
In searching for the answer,

9
00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:20.540 line:15% 
he began exploring what is known as

10
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.414 line:15% 
entanglement theory and the quantum mind.

11
00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:30.108 line:15% 
(soothing guitar music)

12
00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:34.377 line:15% 
I've wanted to interview you for a couple of years

13
00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:35.781 line:15% 
so I'm very glad we have the time to meet

14
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.764 line:15% 
even for just a half an hour.

15
00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:41.091 line:15% 
And as I was reading about your life story a little bit,

16
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:42.863 line:15% 
I tried to imagine what it must have

17
00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:44.463 line:15% 
been like to be your teacher.

18
00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:46.703 line:15% 
As you say here, quite reasonably so,

19
00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:48.239 line:15% 
they couldn't have paid her enough to answer

20
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.743 line:15% 
the kind of questions you were asking

21
00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:51.578 line:15% 
as a little tyke such as,

22
00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:54.244 line:15% 
"Does life have any real purpose

23
00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:56.928 line:15% 
"or is all of this emphasis on mathematics and spelling

24
00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:59.189 line:15% 
"just a distraction to avert our attention from more

25
00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.048 line:15% 
"important questions like the futility of existence?"

26
00:01:02.048 --> 00:01:04.106 line:15% 
And you were probably about three feet tall

27
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.034 line:15% 
when you were asking her these questions.

28
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:06.599 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

29
00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.244 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>What is it in you, who are you?</v>

30
00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:10.748 line:15% 
I mean what is this about you

31
00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:12.700 line:15% 
that took you on such an incredible journey

32
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.345 line:15% 
to where you are now, so highly respected in this realm?

33
00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:17.840 line:15% 
<v ->I suspect that if you interviewed most scientists</v>

34
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.760 line:15% 
and certainly all philosophers

35
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.403 line:15% 
that they would have a very similar story.

36
00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:23.663 line:15% 
It's just the, it's what we come in with

37
00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:27.440 line:15% 
which drives us to be wondering about

38
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.317 line:15% 
those questions as children and as adults.

39
00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:31.216 line:15% 
And the question's the same.

40
00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.235 line:15% 
The way we go about answering the questions

41
00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:36.147 line:15% 
are slightly different, but that's who we are.

42
00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:37.992 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>That's who, well that's certainly who you are.</v>

43
00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:39.912 line:15% 
And you took a kind of a dual path

44
00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.226 line:15% 
of understanding in the sciences.

45
00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:44.754 line:15% 
In one case, you got your masters in electrical engineering,

46
00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.474 line:15% 
then you went on to study how the mind works

47
00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:51.388 line:15% 
by getting your PhD in psychology.

48
00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:54.247 line:15% 
<v ->One of the problems with being a precocious child</v>

49
00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.974 line:15% 
is that you're interested in everything.

50
00:01:56.914 --> 00:01:58.780 line:15% 
But the way that the academia works

51
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.190 line:15% 
is you're forced to go into a discipline.

52
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.153 line:15% 
And the more you go deeply into a discipline,

53
00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:06.033 line:15% 
the more you get blinders on the rest of the world.

54
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.921 line:15% 
So I went into electrical engineering

55
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:09.702 line:15% 
'cause I thought it was cool.

56
00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:10.502 line:15% 
I like to make gadgets.

57
00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:11.995 line:15% 
I like to do stuff.

58
00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:17.680 line:15% 
I also had an honors degree in physics

59
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.261 line:15% 
because that was kind of interesting too.

60
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:23.088 line:15% 
And PhD in psychology because well, why not?

61
00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:24.912 line:15% 
That seems like an interesting thing.

62
00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:26.689 line:15% 
All of them are kind of wrapped around

63
00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.526 line:15% 
the idea of what is experience,

64
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:32.445 line:15% 
and what does it mean to have experience?

65
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.066 line:15% 
What does that say about the nature of reality?

66
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:34.909 line:15% 
All of these questions.

67
00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.173 line:15% 
So, and part of it is simply paying attention to experience

68
00:02:38.173 --> 00:02:41.160 line:15% 
and the humanities since I also had a background in music--

69
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.505 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Violin, you were performing for many years.</v>

70
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:44.445 line:15% 
<v ->Right, as a concert violinist.</v>

71
00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.065 line:15% 
But then the other side was, well,

72
00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.079 line:15% 
what do we do about it?

73
00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.839 line:15% 
And that's where science comes in.

74
00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.559 line:15% 
So I was academically trying to find a way

75
00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.279 line:15% 
of learning enough in all the disciplines

76
00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.836 line:15% 
to be able to do something about it.

77
00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:58.342 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It seems to me what really separated you</v>

78
00:02:58.342 --> 00:03:01.884 line:15% 
is that a lot of the scientists of this world

79
00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:05.931 line:15% 
are not going to make any forays

80
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:07.459 line:15% 
into territories that would have a

81
00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.496 line:15% 
large giggle factor attached to them.

82
00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:12.429 line:15% 
But very early on you became interested in

83
00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.440 line:15% 
the whole notion of psychic phenomena

84
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.939 line:15% 
and you started researching texts throughout history,

85
00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.690 line:15% 
The Vedas, fairytales, everything,

86
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.564 line:15% 
trying to make some sense of the connection

87
00:03:25.564 --> 00:03:27.729 line:15% 
between science and psychic phenomena.

88
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.023 line:15% 
How did that develop for you, because this has

89
00:03:30.023 --> 00:03:32.433 line:15% 
obviously colored the rest of your research.

90
00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:36.070 line:15% 
<v ->The true answer is I don't know.</v>

91
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.353 line:15% 
I've always been interested in these topics.

92
00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:40.507 line:15% 
That is not that unusual.

93
00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:42.534 line:15% 
I mean if it were unusual then Harry Potter

94
00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:43.923 line:15% 
as a book series would not be

95
00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:47.058 line:15% 
so wildly interesting and popular.

96
00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:48.669 line:15% 
The thing what happens, I think what happens

97
00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.218 line:15% 
for a lot of people is that life gets in the way.

98
00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:54.151 line:15% 
So we're taught as children that when you become an adult,

99
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.794 line:15% 
you set aside childish things,

100
00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:57.959 line:15% 
and you start thinking about serious stuff,

101
00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.686 line:15% 
and I guess I just decided that I never wanted to grow up.

102
00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:01.870 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Good for you.</v>

103
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.228 line:15% 
<v ->You know, there's something interesting about fairytales.</v>

104
00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:07.293 line:15% 
Why can't, as an adult, I be interested in those as stories

105
00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:11.099 line:15% 
and maybe parables that are echoed in mythology

106
00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.371 line:15% 
and echoed certainly in popular culture

107
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:15.885 line:15% 
and echoed in science as well?

108
00:04:15.885 --> 00:04:18.551 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And people really are,</v>

109
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.823 line:15% 
we're at a point now because there is so much

110
00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:23.906 line:15% 
oppressive information in the media to perpetuate

111
00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:26.231 line:15% 
the giggle factor when it comes to psychic phenomena

112
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.983 line:15% 
that even the individual in Western cultures are

113
00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:33.983 line:15% 
almost afraid to let his interest in this be known to others

114
00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:37.782 line:15% 
for fear of his being ridiculed, his or her being ridiculed.

115
00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:40.225 line:15% 
Even women saying, "I've had a dream" are ridiculed

116
00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:42.518 line:15% 
by their husbands in the morning upon the telling

117
00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:44.918 line:15% 
of the dream that may turn out to be prophetic, right?

118
00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:45.618 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

119
00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.159 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>This sort of thing.</v>

120
00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.381 line:15% 
<v ->The society of ridicule.</v>

121
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:50.823 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes, and, so you had to go</v>

122
00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:53.483 line:15% 
a step further because there's not a lot

123
00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:56.752 line:15% 
of money to support psychic research.

124
00:04:56.752 --> 00:04:58.415 line:15% 
So when you're out there looking for grants

125
00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:00.069 line:15% 
in your academic career, that's not where

126
00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.487 line:15% 
you're going to find the big money.

127
00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:04.026 line:15% 
What happened with you and your journey into this?

128
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:05.018 line:15% 
Because you've done an incredible

129
00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:07.390 line:15% 
amount of research in this area.

130
00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:10.799 line:15% 
<v ->Sometimes people ask me since I've been doing this</v>

131
00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:13.594 line:15% 
for 30 years or so, what's the most amazing

132
00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:16.440 line:15% 
psychic phenomena I've ever witnessed?

133
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.803 line:15% 
And the answer is my career.

134
00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:19.192 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

135
00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:22.195 line:15% 
<v ->Because, in a sense, it's the active intention</v>

136
00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:25.480 line:15% 
that this is the most interesting thing I know how to do.

137
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.016 line:15% 
And so how am I going to do that?

138
00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:28.734 line:15% 
How am I going to make a living doing that?

139
00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:31.219 line:15% 
And you have to create it somehow.

140
00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.659 line:15% 
You craft it.

141
00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:33.775 line:15% 
Among other things, that means

142
00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:35.322 line:15% 
you have to be willing to move.

143
00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:37.039 line:15% 
You have to be willing to take risk.

144
00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.794 line:15% 
You have to be willing to withstand the slings

145
00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:42.233 line:15% 
and arrows of a whole bunch of people

146
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:44.313 line:15% 
who don't like what you're doing.

147
00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:47.414 line:15% 
And that's, I don't know.

148
00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.278 line:15% 
You know, so I'm asked by students all the time

149
00:05:49.278 --> 00:05:50.835 line:15% 
this question 'cause the students say

150
00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:51.816 line:15% 
they haven't learned yet that

151
00:05:51.816 --> 00:05:53.277 line:15% 
you're not supposed to do certain things.

152
00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:54.770 line:15% 
So they say what do I need to learn?

153
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.616 line:15% 
How do I do what you're doing?

154
00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:00.551 line:15% 
And it's not clear to me that you can tell somebody.

155
00:06:00.551 --> 00:06:04.477 line:15% 
You can't give the recipe that will define success.

156
00:06:04.477 --> 00:06:06.641 line:15% 
You could give a recipe if they're interested in

157
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:09.946 line:15% 
the conventional line because then there's a career track.

158
00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:13.103 line:15% 
You do these things, and you're successful and you'll do it.

159
00:06:13.103 --> 00:06:16.089 line:15% 
There is no career track when you're working off,

160
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:18.596 line:15% 
off the mainstream, and it's not

161
00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:19.874 line:15% 
just true for psychic phenomena.

162
00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:21.613 line:15% 
It's true for lots of different areas in science,

163
00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:25.250 line:15% 
which you're just not deeply inside the mainstream.

164
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.330 line:15% 
Anything out on the edge, which is where I think

165
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.711 line:15% 
all the excitement is, that's, it's the exploration

166
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.036 line:15% 
which is the interesting part for me,

167
00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.169 line:15% 
there is no career track.

168
00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.652 line:15% 
You have to figure it out yourself.

169
00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:38.667 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And you have done so, and people</v>

170
00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:40.246 line:15% 
show up in great numbers around the world

171
00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:42.443 line:15% 
to hear what you have to say because you talk about

172
00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:44.203 line:15% 
entanglement, and this is an area of

173
00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:46.848 line:15% 
quantum physics that is really not known.

174
00:06:46.848 --> 00:06:48.160 line:15% 
Most people have never even heard

175
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.940 line:15% 
of the word entanglement before.

176
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.220 line:15% 
<v ->I find that hard to believe.</v>

177
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.854 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well, 'cause you're</v>

178
00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:55.132 line:15% 
at the epicenter of it. (laughs)

179
00:06:55.132 --> 00:06:56.426 line:15% 
The average person watching

180
00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:58.291 line:15% 
Survivors probably hasn't heard of it, however,

181
00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:00.211 line:15% 
most of our viewers probably have.

182
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.259 line:15% 
Can you talk about your journey into the unraveling

183
00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.473 line:15% 
of the theory of entanglement.

184
00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:08.307 line:15% 
<v ->Well, it's hardly unraveled.</v>

185
00:07:08.307 --> 00:07:10.451 line:15% 
This is one of those things that at the leading edge

186
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.254 line:15% 
of physics, where we know it's true

187
00:07:12.254 --> 00:07:14.280 line:15% 
because experiments prove it.

188
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.784 line:15% 
It was predicted by the mathematics of

189
00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:18.525 line:15% 
quantum entanglement or of quantum theory.

190
00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:22.739 line:15% 
Nobody really knows what it means, so we have ways

191
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:25.256 line:15% 
of interpreting what we think it means.

192
00:07:25.256 --> 00:07:27.269 line:15% 
The reason why I'm interested in the physics

193
00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.157 line:15% 
of this is because the mystery within

194
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.897 line:15% 
psychic phenomena is all about physics.

195
00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:34.137 line:15% 
It's about how is it that my experience can include

196
00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:36.975 line:15% 
things which are far away and are not

197
00:07:36.975 --> 00:07:38.385 line:15% 
going to be able to make it through my

198
00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:40.834 line:15% 
ordinary senses or at a different time?

199
00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:43.614 line:15% 
So we're talking about mysteries of space and time.

200
00:07:43.614 --> 00:07:46.547 line:15% 
Well, many people who don't think about it very much

201
00:07:46.547 --> 00:07:48.595 line:15% 
say, "Well, psychic phenomena can't be true

202
00:07:48.595 --> 00:07:51.432 line:15% 
"because it violates the laws of nature."

203
00:07:51.432 --> 00:07:52.705 line:15% 
But they're talking about the laws of nature

204
00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:56.118 line:15% 
as we knew them in the 17th century, not now.

205
00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:59.318 line:15% 
Now, we know that time and space are relative.

206
00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:01.878 line:15% 
We know that through entanglement phenomena

207
00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:03.275 line:15% 
that things are connected even though

208
00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.216 line:15% 
they appear to be separate.

209
00:08:05.216 --> 00:08:07.360 line:15% 
All of these, the physics, the underlying physics

210
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.357 line:15% 
of how we understand space, time, matter and energy now

211
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.579 line:15% 
are completely compatible with the notion that

212
00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:17.514 line:15% 
you're mostly in here, mostly brain activity

213
00:08:17.514 --> 00:08:19.573 line:15% 
in the way that neuroscience understands it,

214
00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:22.100 line:15% 
but not all, and it's that extra piece

215
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.980 line:15% 
which is left over which seems to be very compatible

216
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.760 line:15% 
with what people talk about as

217
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.215 line:15% 
psychic experience and mystical experience.

218
00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:30.825 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And speaking of that, there's one</v>

219
00:08:30.825 --> 00:08:33.073 line:15% 
very famous case and I think a lot of people,

220
00:08:33.073 --> 00:08:36.422 line:15% 
even people watching this have relegated to urban myth,

221
00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:38.139 line:15% 
but it wasn't urban myth, and that was about

222
00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:40.688 line:15% 
the university student in England

223
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:45.008 line:15% 
who went in for some minor medical complaint,

224
00:08:45.008 --> 00:08:46.277 line:15% 
and it was discovered that he had,

225
00:08:46.277 --> 00:08:48.784 line:15% 
virtually, no physical brain.

226
00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:50.778 line:15% 
This is not an urban myth, right?

227
00:08:50.778 --> 00:08:51.845 line:15% 
<v ->That's true, yeah.</v>

228
00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:53.263 line:15% 
There are about 100 cases like that.

229
00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:55.119 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And he had an IQ of 126,</v>

230
00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:57.199 line:15% 
and he just did fabulously in his life.

231
00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:58.703 line:15% 
Can you talk about that?

232
00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:01.381 line:15% 
What is the implication of not needing a brain

233
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.580 line:15% 
in order to be able to access vast amounts of intelligence?

234
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.818 line:15% 
<v ->Well, there is a brain.</v>

235
00:09:05.818 --> 00:09:06.853 line:15% 
It's just not a brain in the way

236
00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:08.218 line:15% 
that it is classically portrayed

237
00:09:08.218 --> 00:09:11.215 line:15% 
as a hunk of tissue of a certain anatomy.

238
00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:13.636 line:15% 
In these cases, about 100 in the world

239
00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:16.356 line:15% 
where people have supposedly no brain,

240
00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:19.268 line:15% 
what happens is that their cerebral spinal fluid,

241
00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:22.032 line:15% 
which leaks into the brain and starts pushing it,

242
00:09:22.032 --> 00:09:24.358 line:15% 
the pressure pushes it so it becomes the outside

243
00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:27.537 line:15% 
or the inside of the cranium, against the bone itself,

244
00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:29.353 line:15% 
and you end up with a brain that's about

245
00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:31.614 line:15% 
a millimeter thick, and it's just distributed

246
00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:33.310 line:15% 
all around the inside of your head.

247
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.891 line:15% 
That doesn't fit any of our models of how the anatomy

248
00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.909 line:15% 
of the brain works now, but if that process happens

249
00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:42.493 line:15% 
slowly enough, the brain is extremely adaptive,

250
00:09:42.493 --> 00:09:45.810 line:15% 
and is able to rewire itself and reorient itself and so on

251
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.058 line:15% 
so that it'll keep doing what it

252
00:09:47.058 --> 00:09:49.085 line:15% 
needs to do to keep the body alive.

253
00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:51.623 line:15% 
The challenge, though, to neuroscience is that,

254
00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:54.450 line:15% 
that we don't understand how

255
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.073 line:15% 
that level of plasticity can occur.

256
00:09:57.073 --> 00:09:59.014 line:15% 
I mean 'cause we're talking about massive amounts

257
00:09:59.014 --> 00:10:02.542 line:15% 
of rewiring and redistribution, and all kinds of weird stuff

258
00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:05.228 line:15% 
that is not really being looked at

259
00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:07.628 line:15% 
very much by neuroscience today, and in fact,

260
00:10:07.628 --> 00:10:09.164 line:15% 
up until about 10 years ago, it wasn't

261
00:10:09.164 --> 00:10:12.780 line:15% 
thought that the adult brain was plastic at all.

262
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.484 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

263
00:10:13.484 --> 00:10:17.089 line:15% 
<v ->Now this is well-accepted, but you know how things</v>

264
00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:19.499 line:15% 
go in science, that the first reaction

265
00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:22.945 line:15% 
that people have to a new idea is this is crazy.

266
00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:25.386 line:15% 
Anybody who'll look at it is crazy.

267
00:10:25.386 --> 00:10:27.499 line:15% 
Ten years later, it's accepted because

268
00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:29.984 line:15% 
it takes a while for people to get to it.

269
00:10:29.984 --> 00:10:32.085 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So to you is the intrigue that the brain</v>

270
00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:35.365 line:15% 
has this kind of plasticity, that it can adapt

271
00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.580 line:15% 
so it can still process information such as that

272
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.598 line:15% 
young man's brain was or is there something else

273
00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:44.360 line:15% 
beyond that in terms in more of quantum

274
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.091 line:15% 
sources of information interfacing with the brain?

275
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:50.846 line:15% 
<v ->Well, that's one piece of the puzzle which says that</v>

276
00:10:50.846 --> 00:10:53.469 line:15% 
brain and mind may not be the same thing.

277
00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:54.332 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

278
00:10:54.332 --> 00:10:56.103 line:15% 
<v ->But there are many other pieces as well.</v>

279
00:10:56.103 --> 00:10:58.280 line:15% 
For example, the nature of genius and the nature of

280
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.743 line:15% 
autistic savants were able to do lightning calculation

281
00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:03.635 line:15% 
and look at something once and

282
00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:06.362 line:15% 
do a perfect rendering by drawing it.

283
00:11:06.362 --> 00:11:08.922 line:15% 
Many, many examples of things like that, and also

284
00:11:08.922 --> 00:11:11.679 line:15% 
mind bodies as an example where we now know

285
00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.823 line:15% 
that people can withstand freezing temperatures

286
00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:16.841 line:15% 
for basically indefinitely or extremely hot temperatures

287
00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:20.270 line:15% 
and do all kinds of stuff that are not well-accounted for

288
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.038 line:15% 
by what might be called mechanistic theories

289
00:11:23.038 --> 00:11:26.599 line:15% 
of the body and the brain as machines.

290
00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:29.171 line:15% 
If it is a machine, it's a very strange machine which is

291
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:32.230 line:15% 
super adaptive and is very strongly related

292
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.268 line:15% 
to what's going on inside your head.

293
00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:36.411 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So where do you think this is coming from?</v>

294
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:39.035 line:15% 
The genius, this high adaptivity

295
00:11:39.035 --> 00:11:41.413 line:15% 
and so forth, this high creativity.

296
00:11:41.413 --> 00:11:43.780 line:15% 
<v ->Well, some of it might be simply due to the way that</v>

297
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.914 line:15% 
the brain and the body are wired.

298
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.279 line:15% 
Some people are talented.

299
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:51.155 line:15% 
But I think of the case of some kind of geniuses

300
00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:53.085 line:15% 
that they're getting information

301
00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:55.400 line:15% 
which is not already in here.

302
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.224 line:15% 
It's coming from somewhere else.

303
00:11:57.224 --> 00:11:59.602 line:15% 
If it wasn't for the fact that we have an enormous

304
00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:01.821 line:15% 
amount of laboratory evidence suggesting

305
00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.402 line:15% 
as psychic phenomena are true, it would be

306
00:12:04.402 --> 00:12:06.887 line:15% 
very difficult to account for where genius comes from.

307
00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:08.904 line:15% 
But since we do have that data, then we know

308
00:12:08.904 --> 00:12:11.421 line:15% 
that people can get information from a distance

309
00:12:11.421 --> 00:12:14.684 line:15% 
and space or time, in which case then the genius

310
00:12:14.684 --> 00:12:18.182 line:15% 
can be reframed in a sense as these people

311
00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:21.510 line:15% 
have the talent to be able to get information

312
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.046 line:15% 
of the type that they're looking for.

313
00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:24.688 line:15% 
So they pull it in.

314
00:12:24.688 --> 00:12:26.203 line:15% 
Where they pulled it in from, who knows?

315
00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:27.707 line:15% 
Maybe they pulled it in from the future.

316
00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:29.809 line:15% 
But nevertheless, that's their talent.

317
00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:31.003 line:15% 
That's how it's expressed.

318
00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:33.072 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It's even been suggested that</v>

319
00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:34.757 line:15% 
the memory as we know doesn't reside

320
00:12:34.757 --> 00:12:36.858 line:15% 
within the brain, but it is more an ability

321
00:12:36.858 --> 00:12:41.338 line:15% 
to pull information in from some other quantum source.

322
00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:43.120 line:15% 
<v ->Or maybe both.
<v Voiceover>Or both.</v>

323
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.973 line:15% 
<v Together>Yeah.</v>

324
00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:45.701 line:15% 
<v ->I think in most cases, the correct answer</v>

325
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:47.599 line:15% 
to these kinds of questions is it's both.

326
00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:48.248 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Or both, yeah.</v>

327
00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:50.594 line:15% 
<v ->The neuroscientists are not incorrect.</v>

328
00:12:50.594 --> 00:12:53.155 line:15% 
There's a lot about it that is incorrect because

329
00:12:53.155 --> 00:12:54.295 line:15% 
that's provable as well.

330
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:56.012 line:15% 
But that's the underlying assumption.

331
00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:58.156 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Let's look at entanglement through a subject</v>

332
00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:00.488 line:15% 
you brought up in your book which is of twins,

333
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.430 line:15% 
of identical twins, and you brought up

334
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.104 line:15% 
a very interesting subject.

335
00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:05.192 line:15% 
What were their names?

336
00:13:05.192 --> 00:13:07.293 line:15% 
The Jims and the Betties.

337
00:13:07.293 --> 00:13:09.277 line:15% 
Can you talk about what happened with those two?

338
00:13:09.277 --> 00:13:10.462 line:15% 
<v ->Well, no.</v>

339
00:13:10.462 --> 00:13:12.332 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>With Jim, the Jims.</v>

340
00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:13.949 line:15% 
<v ->Jim, but I don't remember his brother's name,</v>

341
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:15.594 line:15% 
but these were identical twins.

342
00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:16.677 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Jim and Jim.</v>

343
00:13:16.677 --> 00:13:17.445 line:15% 
<v ->They're both named Jim?</v>

344
00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:18.533 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, they're both named Jim.</v>

345
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:18.991 line:15% 
<v ->Okay.</v>

346
00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:20.111 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>They were separated at birth.</v>

347
00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:21.423 line:15% 
<v ->Babies separated at birth, right.</v>

348
00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:23.663 line:15% 
Identical twins, both with the same names, the same

349
00:13:23.663 --> 00:13:26.567 line:15% 
wives' names, the same houses.
<v Voiceover>Same career.</v>

350
00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:28.363 line:15% 
<v ->The same interests, the same career, all kinds of things</v>

351
00:13:28.363 --> 00:13:31.008 line:15% 
which looked like they were living almost parallel lives.

352
00:13:32.118 --> 00:13:33.626 line:15% 
Well, how do we account for that?

353
00:13:33.626 --> 00:13:35.247 line:15% 
So from a conventional point of view,

354
00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.647 line:15% 
you might say that their genetics being identical

355
00:13:37.647 --> 00:13:40.164 line:15% 
would lend them towards things, which would make

356
00:13:40.164 --> 00:13:41.399 line:15% 
preferences that they would

357
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:43.511 line:15% 
choose over the course of their life.

358
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.570 line:15% 
When you think about the level of detail.

359
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.310 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>The odds.</v>

360
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.515 line:15% 
<v ->That would need to encoded</v>

361
00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:50.779 line:15% 
into genes to do that, it doesn't make any sense.

362
00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:54.265 line:15% 
Why almost at the same time they decide

363
00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:57.166 line:15% 
to make a white picket fence around their house?

364
00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.193 line:15% 
Is there a gene that encodes for that?

365
00:13:59.193 --> 00:14:01.070 line:15% 
It doesn't seem very likely.

366
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.693 line:15% 
So another way of looking at it is that as we know

367
00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.670 line:15% 
that elementary systems that were once

368
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.398
in contact with each other, they separate,

369
00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:09.520 line:15% 
and they go on their separate ways, but

370
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.016 line:15% 
they're still connected in some way.

371
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.512 line:15% 
Well, identical twins are connected at some point,

372
00:14:13.512 --> 00:14:15.604 line:15% 
and then they separate and go on their separate way.

373
00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.810 line:15% 
But maybe there's something that connects them.

374
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.082 line:15% 
And maybe that's what accounts for these strange

375
00:14:20.082 --> 00:14:24.022 line:15% 
coincidences between separated at-birth identical twins.

376
00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.522 line:15% 
<v ->So let's beyond twins and things that are very</v>

377
00:14:27.522 --> 00:14:29.645 line:15% 
recognizable to us, and let's go into the world

378
00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:30.848 line:15% 
of quantum physics and let's go

379
00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:32.523 line:15% 
into some of the experiments.

380
00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:36.318 line:15% 
You're perpetually conducting experiments

381
00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:37.822 line:15% 
as are many other people.

382
00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:39.625 line:15% 
What are some of the most profound experiments

383
00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.609 line:15% 
that have occurred to you in the realm of physics

384
00:14:41.609 --> 00:14:45.768 line:15% 
that are showing us that we are energetically

385
00:14:45.768 --> 00:14:48.765 line:15% 
on a quantum level connected whether we like it or not?

386
00:14:49.905 --> 00:14:51.336 line:15% 
<v ->Whether we like it or not.</v>

387
00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:53.032 line:15% 
Yes, I guess that's what physics is about.

388
00:14:53.032 --> 00:14:53.757 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

389
00:14:53.757 --> 00:14:58.757 line:15% 
<v ->So the sequence is prediction of entanglement,</v>

390
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.087 line:15% 
and then eventually demonstration of entanglement

391
00:15:02.087 --> 00:15:05.884 line:15% 
at the level of photons, electrons, elementary particles.

392
00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.892 line:15% 
What's happening now in the last even five years

393
00:15:08.892 --> 00:15:10.407 line:15% 
in the even of matter of months

394
00:15:10.407 --> 00:15:14.011 line:15% 
from when we're speaking is recognition

395
00:15:14.011 --> 00:15:16.655 line:15% 
that entanglement is far more robust

396
00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:20.006 line:15% 
and ubiquitous than previously thought.

397
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:23.046 line:15% 
The next level is that we can find the evidence

398
00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:25.009 line:15% 
for entanglement in macroscopic systems,

399
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:27.770 line:15% 
not just elementary particles, and what's called

400
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.566 line:15% 
ensemble entanglement, which is in the systems of many

401
00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:34.512 line:15% 
particles, like 100,000 atoms here, and 100,000 atoms there

402
00:15:34.512 --> 00:15:37.093 line:15% 
and the joint behavior's entangled.

403
00:15:37.093 --> 00:15:40.126 line:15% 
The next step which is just now within the beginning

404
00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:44.126 line:15% 
of 2009 becoming popular is biological entanglement,

405
00:15:44.126 --> 00:15:47.145 line:15% 
which we see that living systems not only are

406
00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:51.706 line:15% 
entangled, but entanglement is necessary in order for

407
00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:54.155 line:15% 
the living systems to behave in the way that they do.

408
00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:55.894 line:15% 
So I'm talking about enzyme activity.

409
00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:58.365 line:15% 
I'm talking about photosynthesis.

410
00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:00.949 line:15% 
There's a recent report on the reason

411
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:04.778 line:15% 
why birds are able to navigate using

412
00:16:04.778 --> 00:16:07.850 line:15% 
Earth's magnetic field is due to

413
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.253 line:15% 
a quantum coherence effect in their brain structure.

414
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:14.420 line:15% 
It's actually, it has to do with the ions in their brains

415
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.012 line:15% 
are quantum-coherent, and that makes them

416
00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:20.117 line:15% 
extremely sensitive way of picking up magnetic fields.

417
00:16:20.117 --> 00:16:25.117 line:15% 
So avian, I forget exactly, avian magneto-navigation

418
00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:28.982 line:15% 
or some word like that is dependent on a quantum effect.

419
00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:33.398 line:15% 
So probably we will start seeing human

420
00:16:33.398 --> 00:16:35.094 line:15% 
entanglement experiments.

421
00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:37.142 line:15% 
I know they're on the drawing board already.

422
00:16:37.142 --> 00:16:40.043 line:15% 
Sometime after that, who knows how many years,

423
00:16:40.043 --> 00:16:42.730 line:15% 
maybe a matter of months, we'll start seeing

424
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.151 line:15% 
experiments that look a whole lot like

425
00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:48.713 line:15% 
what has classically been called telepathy experiments.

426
00:16:48.713 --> 00:16:50.366 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I was just going to say, these experiments,</v>

427
00:16:50.366 --> 00:16:53.065 line:15% 
they'll be oriented as experiments,

428
00:16:53.065 --> 00:16:55.452 line:15% 
but in fact the phenomena has always existed.

429
00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:56.348 line:15% 
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

430
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.993 line:15% 
The phenomena has clearly been here all the time.

431
00:16:58.993 --> 00:17:01.415 line:15% 
And in fact, if you go back a century when

432
00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:05.838 line:15% 
psychic research started to be laboratory mediated

433
00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:10.265 line:15% 
and systematized, the phenomena was there.

434
00:17:10.265 --> 00:17:12.024 line:15% 
So people were able to do telepathy experiments,

435
00:17:12.024 --> 00:17:14.008 line:15% 
and it's been going on for a long time.

436
00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:16.504 line:15% 
The physics had not yet caught up to it.

437
00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:18.371 line:15% 
So I think what we're finding now is

438
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.950 line:15% 
this long lineage of experiences of people report,

439
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.254 line:15% 
and a physics which is catching up to the nature

440
00:17:23.254 --> 00:17:25.883 line:15% 
of the experience, and eventually they're gonna converge

441
00:17:25.883 --> 00:17:27.893 line:15% 
and we'll have a physical explanation

442
00:17:27.893 --> 00:17:29.771 line:15% 
for why people have ESP.

443
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:30.549 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

444
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.232 line:15% 
I mean, some people just bypass it and say

445
00:17:32.232 --> 00:17:33.288 line:15% 
"It's obvious.

446
00:17:33.288 --> 00:17:34.535 line:15% 
"I've experienced it."

447
00:17:34.535 --> 00:17:36.507 line:15% 
But for the western world, for many,

448
00:17:36.507 --> 00:17:38.481 line:15% 
many people, that's really not enough.

449
00:17:38.481 --> 00:17:39.781 line:15% 
<v ->Well, even if you have experienced it,</v>

450
00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:42.107 line:15% 
you can accept that something is true,

451
00:17:42.107 --> 00:17:43.812 line:15% 
but at least the scientific mind is thinking,.

452
00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:45.829 line:15% 
"Well, how in the world does that work?"

453
00:17:45.829 --> 00:17:46.544 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

454
00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:49.594 line:15% 
<v ->And so, I think if you look at historically about how</v>

455
00:17:49.594 --> 00:17:52.314 line:15% 
knowledge advances, it sort of goes in a spiral.

456
00:17:52.314 --> 00:17:54.177 line:15% 
It keeps going around and around...

457
00:17:55.497 --> 00:17:57.263 line:15% 
and it keeps coming back to the same kind of

458
00:17:57.263 --> 00:17:59.618 line:15% 
phenomena, but with a new level of understanding.

459
00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:00.130 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

460
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.866 line:15% 
<v ->So what we'll probably end up with is</v>

461
00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:04.874 line:15% 
a new recognition of all of the things

462
00:18:04.874 --> 00:18:06.880 line:15% 
that mystics and psychics talked about,

463
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.004 line:15% 
but with a level of understanding that they didn't have.

464
00:18:10.004 --> 00:18:11.990 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And so it'll go with the rest of society</v>

465
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.707 line:15% 
permission, then, to begin employing

466
00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:17.067 line:15% 
and utilizing, and having faith and trust again in our,

467
00:18:17.067 --> 00:18:19.002 line:15% 
you could call it a survival skill.

468
00:18:19.002 --> 00:18:19.872 line:15% 
I think Larry Josie was calling it

469
00:18:19.872 --> 00:18:22.177 line:15% 
one of our survival skills, which is our ability

470
00:18:22.177 --> 00:18:24.737 line:15% 
to communicate telepathically, et cetera.

471
00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.593 line:15% 
<v ->Well, I think we have always been</v>

472
00:18:26.593 --> 00:18:29.420 line:15% 
using these abilities that it's part of the

473
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.088 line:15% 
fabric of reality and whether we may not be aware

474
00:18:33.088 --> 00:18:35.808 line:15% 
of using psychic abilities, we'll probably

475
00:18:35.808 --> 00:18:37.227 line:15% 
come up with a different name for it,

476
00:18:37.227 --> 00:18:41.099 line:15% 
like intuition is sometimes used as a substitute.

477
00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:44.864 line:15% 
I think it has probably been important in evolution

478
00:18:44.864 --> 00:18:49.323 line:15% 
that we were able to outguess what was about

479
00:18:49.323 --> 00:18:51.882 line:15% 
to happen in the future because if that did not occurred,

480
00:18:51.882 --> 00:18:53.834 line:15% 
then we would probably be dead by now.

481
00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:54.634 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Probably.</v>

482
00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.285 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

483
00:18:55.285 --> 00:18:57.791 line:15% 
In the case of predator/prey, if they both

484
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:59.786 line:15% 
are slightly precognitive and they're taking

485
00:18:59.786 --> 00:19:02.602 line:15% 
advantage of some kind of weird non-locality,

486
00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:04.980 line:15% 
then it's a game, it's a very strange game

487
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.382 line:15% 
because one has to be slightly more precognitive

488
00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:11.615 line:15% 
than the other or we don't know how that would work.

489
00:19:11.615 --> 00:19:14.857 line:15% 
But so we're dealing with a system where it may

490
00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:16.871 line:15% 
have something to do with the level of sentience,

491
00:19:16.871 --> 00:19:19.111 line:15% 
like the level of consciousness that you can

492
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:20.412 line:15% 
bring to bear on a system that makes

493
00:19:20.412 --> 00:19:22.833 line:15% 
its precognition a little bit better than another.

494
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.009 line:15% 
These are all speculative questions now,

495
00:19:25.009 --> 00:19:26.875 line:15% 
but at some point, they're going to be

496
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.475 line:15% 
interesting questions to look at.

497
00:19:28.475 --> 00:19:29.841 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>They'll be very interesting, and meanwhile,</v>

498
00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:31.334 line:15% 
the question's already being looked at.

499
00:19:31.334 --> 00:19:33.104 line:15% 
Some of the experiments that have to do with

500
00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:35.067 line:15% 
the effect of observation.

501
00:19:35.067 --> 00:19:38.256 line:15% 
What are the implications of these experiments?

502
00:19:38.256 --> 00:19:40.453 line:15% 
If you can talk just a little bit about that.

503
00:19:40.453 --> 00:19:42.813 line:15% 
<v ->Are you talking about at the quantum scale or--</v>

504
00:19:42.813 --> 00:19:44.427 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes, the quantum scale.</v>

505
00:19:44.427 --> 00:19:46.123 line:15% 
The effect of observation.

506
00:19:46.123 --> 00:19:49.216 line:15% 
<v ->I think one of the most shocking papers</v>

507
00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:52.917 line:15% 
that appeared in Physics recently. within 2007

508
00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:56.509 line:15% 
I think it was published, was an explicit experimental test

509
00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:59.623 line:15% 
of local realism, and local realism is

510
00:19:59.623 --> 00:20:03.816 line:15% 
the everyday sense that the world is out there.

511
00:20:03.816 --> 00:20:06.685 line:15% 
There's something out there and it's local in the sense

512
00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:09.127 line:15% 
that you can't have things influencing other things

513
00:20:09.127 --> 00:20:11.666 line:15% 
that are not relativistically close.

514
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:13.754 line:15% 
I mean, think of it in the simple sense as

515
00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.813 line:15% 
like billiard balls hitting against each other.

516
00:20:15.813 --> 00:20:17.775 line:15% 
There's no spooky action in the distance.

517
00:20:17.775 --> 00:20:19.983 line:15% 
Well, we know that now non-locality exists.

518
00:20:19.983 --> 00:20:22.683 line:15% 
That's been shown since the 1970's or so.

519
00:20:22.683 --> 00:20:25.428 line:15% 
But the other question was whether reality

520
00:20:25.428 --> 00:20:27.929 line:15% 
exists, whether it is as stable and

521
00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:30.478 line:15% 
there, independent of observers.

522
00:20:30.478 --> 00:20:32.229 line:15% 
So this test was done in 2007,

523
00:20:32.229 --> 00:20:36.046 line:15% 
and it showed that that also is not viable.

524
00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:38.969 line:15% 
So it creates a very strange sense of

525
00:20:38.969 --> 00:20:40.888 line:15% 
what we think we mean by reality.

526
00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:43.982 line:15% 
It is observer-dependent.

527
00:20:43.982 --> 00:20:46.240 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Can you explain that a little bit more?</v>

528
00:20:47.491 --> 00:20:50.043 line:15% 
<v ->Unfortunately, I can't describe it too much better</v>

529
00:20:50.043 --> 00:20:52.799 line:15% 
because our language is so dependent on

530
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.523 line:15% 
talking about assuming the
<v Voiceover>The knowns.</v>

531
00:20:54.523 --> 00:20:57.113 line:15% 
<v ->Local realism that we're talking</v>

532
00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:59.919 line:15% 
about connections that go through space

533
00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:02.308 line:15% 
and time and are dependent on some kind of observation.

534
00:21:02.308 --> 00:21:04.335 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And in some of the experiments that have</v>

535
00:21:04.335 --> 00:21:06.455 line:15% 
been run have to do with the effect of the

536
00:21:06.455 --> 00:21:10.758 line:15% 
mind and the observation of the way photons/particles

537
00:21:10.758 --> 00:21:14.038 line:15% 
will move through, say, one slit in this experiment

538
00:21:14.038 --> 00:21:17.633 line:15% 
versus another slit and the act of observation

539
00:21:17.633 --> 00:21:20.427 line:15% 
or even knowing, as I was hearing you also talk yesterday,

540
00:21:20.427 --> 00:21:25.427 line:15% 
even knowing will determine the pathway that, that, yes.

541
00:21:25.664 --> 00:21:29.184 line:15% 
<v ->Okay, so it's important to separate</v>

542
00:21:29.184 --> 00:21:32.149 line:15% 
the leading edge of mainstream physics versus what I do.

543
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:33.156 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes, okay.</v>

544
00:21:33.156 --> 00:21:35.134 line:15% 
<v ->So what I've done is take what we know from</v>

545
00:21:35.134 --> 00:21:38.067 line:15% 
mainstream physics and take one additional leap of faith,

546
00:21:38.067 --> 00:21:41.565 line:15% 
which is to simply guess that there's something

547
00:21:41.565 --> 00:21:43.912 line:15% 
about mind which is non-local as well.

548
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:46.013 line:15% 
There's something about knowledge and observation

549
00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:48.509 line:15% 
which changes how quantum behavior works.

550
00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:50.812 line:15% 
So if mind is in fact non-local, you should

551
00:21:50.812 --> 00:21:52.914 line:15% 
be able to ask somebody to gain information

552
00:21:52.914 --> 00:21:55.751 line:15% 
out of a quantum double slit experiment

553
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:57.618 line:15% 
and cause the system to behave differently

554
00:21:57.618 --> 00:21:59.239 line:15% 
when you're looking at it with your mind's eye

555
00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:01.291 line:15% 
than when you're not, and so that's

556
00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:02.329 line:15% 
the experiment that I'm doing.

557
00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:03.545 line:15% 
This is not mainstream yet.

558
00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:04.067 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

559
00:22:04.067 --> 00:22:05.369 line:15% 
<v ->In the sense that I can easily publish it</v>

560
00:22:05.369 --> 00:22:08.408 line:15% 
in a mainstream journal, but it is a science experiment,

561
00:22:08.408 --> 00:22:10.563 line:15% 
and it could be done in a scientific way,

562
00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:12.845 line:15% 
and the results strongly suggest

563
00:22:12.845 --> 00:22:15.544 line:15% 
that the non-local mind does exist,

564
00:22:15.544 --> 00:22:17.229 line:15% 
and it does have the capability of gaining

565
00:22:17.229 --> 00:22:19.469 line:15% 
information at a distance, and as a result,

566
00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:22.509 line:15% 
by observing a system with your mind's eye,

567
00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:23.991 line:15% 
you can affect it.

568
00:22:23.991 --> 00:22:25.538 line:15% 
You're affecting it in two ways.

569
00:22:25.538 --> 00:22:27.415 line:15% 
One is you're gaining knowledge from it,

570
00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:29.239 line:15% 
but in the quantum world, gaining knowledge

571
00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:31.479 line:15% 
actually affects how it behaves.

572
00:22:31.479 --> 00:22:32.780 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So there is effectively</v>

573
00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.279 line:15% 
no such thing as objective reality, then.

574
00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.369 line:15% 
<v ->That's one of the implications, yeah.</v>

575
00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:40.615 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>That's difficult for a lot of people to accept</v>

576
00:22:40.615 --> 00:22:42.663 line:15% 
because that means somehow they are

577
00:22:42.663 --> 00:22:44.377 line:15% 
participating in the creation of

578
00:22:44.377 --> 00:22:46.213 line:15% 
what they're perceiving as reality.

579
00:22:46.213 --> 00:22:46.969 line:15% 
<v ->That's true.</v>

580
00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:49.156 line:15% 
Well, that's true even from a psychological perspective.

581
00:22:49.156 --> 00:22:49.753
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

582
00:22:49.753 --> 00:22:52.995 line:15% 
<v ->I mean we're always, just purely based on psychology</v>

583
00:22:52.995 --> 00:22:55.417 line:15% 
projecting the world the way that we wish to see it.

584
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:56.355 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Very true, but you're looking</v>

585
00:22:56.355 --> 00:22:58.241
at it from another structure entirely.

586
00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:00.200 line:15% 
<v ->We're looking at it from not only a psychological</v>

587
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.124 line:15% 
but from a physical perspective, and it really does

588
00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:06.696 line:15% 
question the notion of objective versus subjective

589
00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:09.405 line:15% 
distinction, and what we're seeing here is more like

590
00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:12.903 line:15% 
an omnijective or some other word that suggests

591
00:23:12.903 --> 00:23:17.108 line:15% 
a blurring of the two that in some way our observation,

592
00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:19.914 line:15% 
our perceptions, our intentions or attentions

593
00:23:19.914 --> 00:23:22.620 line:15% 
are shaping the way the world actually manifests.

594
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.052 line:15% 
So if you take a huge leap of faith, you end up with books

595
00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:28.164 line:15% 
like The Secret, where you're literally

596
00:23:28.164 --> 00:23:30.191 line:15% 
manifesting everything that you want.

597
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:31.791 line:15% 
I don't think it goes that far.

598
00:23:31.791 --> 00:23:35.192 line:15% 
I think in principle that something like that is true,

599
00:23:35.192 --> 00:23:38.404 line:15% 
but it's pushed too far as far as I can tell.

600
00:23:39.224 --> 00:23:41.845
<v Voiceover>Looking at the world through this lens, then,</v>

601
00:23:41.845 --> 00:23:46.845 line:15% 
there is a new emphasis on

602
00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:49.088 line:15% 
what the word freedom means.

603
00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:50.107 line:15% 
There's a new emphasis on

604
00:23:50.107 --> 00:23:53.008 line:15% 
what the word responsibility means.

605
00:23:53.008 --> 00:23:56.827 line:15% 
How do you view this in terms of its extension into life?

606
00:23:56.827 --> 00:23:59.386 line:15% 
<v ->Well, among other things, it means that every thought</v>

607
00:23:59.386 --> 00:24:01.264 line:15% 
that you have is influencing the world

608
00:24:01.264 --> 00:24:03.482 line:15% 
around you and other people as well.

609
00:24:03.482 --> 00:24:06.981 line:15% 
It also further means that what you think of

610
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.423 line:15% 
as your own mind, as yourself,

611
00:24:09.423 --> 00:24:12.879 line:15% 
the thing that you call I is not only in there.

612
00:24:12.879 --> 00:24:14.425 line:15% 
It's distributed in some way.

613
00:24:14.425 --> 00:24:18.543 line:15% 
So what we think changes how other people think,

614
00:24:18.543 --> 00:24:20.024 line:15% 
or at least their sense of self.

615
00:24:20.024 --> 00:24:22.788 line:15% 
That's a huge responsibility when you think about

616
00:24:22.788 --> 00:24:24.867 line:15% 
the consequences of it.
<v Voiceover>Huge.</v>

617
00:24:24.867 --> 00:24:26.265 line:15% 
<v ->You walk around angry all the time,</v>

618
00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:28.579 line:15% 
that's something internally,

619
00:24:28.579 --> 00:24:31.598 line:15% 
you're gonna make everybody angry a little bit around you.

620
00:24:31.598 --> 00:24:32.644 line:15% 
And vice versa.

621
00:24:32.644 --> 00:24:34.190 line:15% 
If you walk around peaceful, other people

622
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.058 line:15% 
will probably end up being a little bit more peaceful.

623
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.584 line:15% 
Why? Because they're not really that different from you.

624
00:24:38.584 --> 00:24:40.312 line:15% 
There's a piece of them in you.

625
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:45.165 line:15% 
So it's tempting to make these huge leaps of faith

626
00:24:45.165 --> 00:24:48.909 line:15% 
into making what I just said extremely powerful,

627
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:52.044 line:15% 
and at this point, I don't know how powerful it is.

628
00:24:52.044 --> 00:24:53.772 line:15% 
I'm pretty sure that it's true.

629
00:24:53.772 --> 00:24:56.389 line:15% 
We have evidence that these things are true,

630
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:59.450 line:15% 
but we don't see them in a very robust way.

631
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.189 line:15% 
They're relatively weak.

632
00:25:01.189 --> 00:25:04.763 line:15% 
Now, what we don't know is that is it

633
00:25:04.763 --> 00:25:06.936 line:15% 
weak because that's how we see it in the laboratory

634
00:25:06.936 --> 00:25:08.589 line:15% 
where we constrain the external world

635
00:25:08.589 --> 00:25:10.989 line:15% 
in the laboratory so it only shows up in certain ways

636
00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:12.834 line:15% 
and we know that there's always going to be a lot

637
00:25:12.834 --> 00:25:15.435 line:15% 
weaker than the ways that things are expressed in the world.

638
00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:19.360 line:15% 
So I'm willing to guess that these kinds of ideas

639
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.166 line:15% 
express themselves in the worlds in a stronger way

640
00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:26.027 line:15% 
than we've seen in the lab, but I don't know how strong.

641
00:25:26.027 --> 00:25:27.499 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Let's look at the flip side of it where</v>

642
00:25:27.499 --> 00:25:29.163 line:15% 
we have the responsibility.

643
00:25:29.163 --> 00:25:31.315 line:15% 
Isn't there an increased freedom in understanding

644
00:25:31.315 --> 00:25:34.248 line:15% 
that we are creating this to a large extent?

645
00:25:34.248 --> 00:25:36.050 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, there's increased freedom,</v>

646
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.547 line:15% 
but you have to be careful especially in cases

647
00:25:38.547 --> 00:25:41.511 line:15% 
of things like illness and health that

648
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:44.551 line:15% 
did somebody get cancer because

649
00:25:44.551 --> 00:25:46.332 line:15% 
they were thinking bad thoughts?

650
00:25:46.332 --> 00:25:49.554 line:15% 
Well, maybe, but there's also a huge

651
00:25:49.554 --> 00:25:50.791 line:15% 
amount of evidence that if you're

652
00:25:50.791 --> 00:25:52.636 line:15% 
accidentally exposed to radiation,

653
00:25:52.636 --> 00:25:54.577 line:15% 
that's gonna affect you too.

654
00:25:54.577 --> 00:25:55.963 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, I'm on the same</v>

655
00:25:55.963 --> 00:25:56.742 line:15% 
page with you on that.

656
00:25:56.742 --> 00:25:59.153 line:15% 
It's hard to attribute it to any one thing,

657
00:25:59.153 --> 00:26:01.628 line:15% 
especially in these times where there's so many influences.

658
00:26:01.628 --> 00:26:05.467 line:15% 
But maybe even more on a spiritual or psycho spiritual level

659
00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:08.016 line:15% 
the freedom that is inherent in understanding

660
00:26:08.016 --> 00:26:10.026 line:15% 
that the evidence is suggesting that

661
00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:12.528 line:15% 
this is our own subjective creation.

662
00:26:12.528 --> 00:26:15.493 line:15% 
Can't we just whip out a new canvas?

663
00:26:15.493 --> 00:26:17.712
<v ->If only it were that easy.</v>

664
00:26:17.712 --> 00:26:19.450 line:15% 
I think, yes, in principle.

665
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.373 line:15% 
Yes, if you, and in fact we know, for example,

666
00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:25.114 line:15% 
if somebody is a certain personality and has something

667
00:26:25.114 --> 00:26:26.821 line:15% 
as dramatic as a near-death experience,

668
00:26:26.821 --> 00:26:28.954 line:15% 
they come out of that as a different person.

669
00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:31.599 line:15% 
Generally more positive, more loving and so on.

670
00:26:31.599 --> 00:26:33.796 line:15% 
So it is possible to have a step function

671
00:26:33.796 --> 00:26:35.993 line:15% 
in the way that you see the world,

672
00:26:35.993 --> 00:26:38.180 line:15% 
and a lot of it has to do with your perception of it.

673
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.918 line:15% 
If you perceive the world as a dangerous place,

674
00:26:39.918 --> 00:26:41.839 line:15% 
it'll be pretty dangerous.

675
00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.204 line:15% 
If you see it as a loving, kind,

676
00:26:43.204 --> 00:26:45.488 line:15% 
safe place, it'll be that too.

677
00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:48.321 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So what do you find as the most</v>

678
00:26:48.321 --> 00:26:51.221 line:15% 
magical element of all of this at this space

679
00:26:51.221 --> 00:26:54.059 line:15% 
where still in the first half, barely, of 2009?

680
00:26:55.629 --> 00:26:58.848 line:15% 
<v ->Well, I guess part of it is is that</v>

681
00:26:58.848 --> 00:27:02.058 line:15% 
the physics, at least the small branch of physics

682
00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:04.555 line:15% 
interested in entanglement, and by the way

683
00:27:04.555 --> 00:27:06.293 line:15% 
the reason why there's so much interest in it

684
00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:09.258 line:15% 
is for crass commercial reasons.

685
00:27:09.258 --> 00:27:12.085 line:15% 
The next type of computers that we need.

686
00:27:12.085 --> 00:27:12.703 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Quantum.</v>

687
00:27:12.703 --> 00:27:14.570 line:15% 
<v ->Are quantum computers, which will be much,</v>

688
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:15.893 line:15% 
much more powerful than the computers

689
00:27:15.893 --> 00:27:20.127 line:15% 
we currently have 'cause we can sort of see the end state

690
00:27:20.127 --> 00:27:22.111 line:15% 
of existing computer technology.

691
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:23.529 line:15% 
We need something much better.

692
00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:25.908 line:15% 
The much better, there's enormous amount of money

693
00:27:25.908 --> 00:27:27.785 line:15% 
being put into how do we create

694
00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:30.441 line:15% 
a room temperature quantum computer.

695
00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:32.490 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So what are the potentials</v>

696
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.313 line:15% 
of quantum computing?

697
00:27:34.313 --> 00:27:37.747 line:15% 
<v ->Quantum computing has the potential of</v>

698
00:27:37.747 --> 00:27:40.211 line:15% 
at minimum of being thousands and thousands of times faster

699
00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:42.856 line:15% 
than the existing computer technology.

700
00:27:42.856 --> 00:27:46.007 line:15% 
But probably more than that, than thousands of times,

701
00:27:46.007 --> 00:27:48.187 line:15% 
probably millions or billions of times faster.

702
00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:51.664 line:15% 
I mean, a real gigantic leap in terms of the speed

703
00:27:51.664 --> 00:27:53.691 line:15% 
with which you can calculate certain things.

704
00:27:53.691 --> 00:27:55.653 line:15% 
I think that quantum computers will actually

705
00:27:55.653 --> 00:27:58.171 line:15% 
be a combination of existing computer technology

706
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:02.213 line:15% 
plus quantum computing engines because the engines

707
00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:04.079 line:15% 
are particularly good at mathematics.

708
00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:06.533 line:15% 
Because rather than making a decision or a calculation

709
00:28:06.533 --> 00:28:09.359 line:15% 
is this or it's that, it'll give you the entire range

710
00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:12.420 line:15% 
of all possible answers in a flash,

711
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.606 line:15% 
like in one calculation you have the whole answer.

712
00:28:14.606 --> 00:28:18.628 line:15% 
So that speeds up things to a level where we really

713
00:28:18.628 --> 00:28:21.690 line:15% 
cannot even do that kind of calculation yet at this point.

714
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.025 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>But hopefully it'll also speed up and advance</v>

715
00:28:24.025 --> 00:28:25.166 line:15% 
the kind of research you're doing

716
00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:27.086 line:15% 
so we can understand not just the quantum computer's

717
00:28:27.086 --> 00:28:29.369 line:15% 
potential, but the human potential.

718
00:28:29.369 --> 00:28:31.171 line:15% 
<v ->It is possible that the brain is a kind of</v>

719
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:33.688 line:15% 
quantum computer, in which case, we may

720
00:28:33.688 --> 00:28:36.217 line:15% 
accidentally discover when we start having good

721
00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:39.213 line:15% 
quantum computers that they're telepathic

722
00:28:39.213 --> 00:28:41.133 line:15% 
and they have clairvoyance and they have

723
00:28:41.133 --> 00:28:43.533 line:15% 
all kinds of weird stuff, which is similar

724
00:28:43.533 --> 00:28:45.549 line:15% 
to what we have in our own head.

725
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:47.650 line:15% 
In fact, they may even be sentient.

726
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.676 line:15% 
Now, this would freak everybody out.

727
00:28:49.676 --> 00:28:52.087 line:15% 
The first time you start up

728
00:28:52.087 --> 00:28:54.775 line:15% 
a really good quantum computer, it might say

729
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:58.135 line:15% 
"Hello, did I just wake up from a dream?"

00:29:00.586 --> 00:29:01.706 line:15% 
We don't know yet, but we'll see.

733
00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:04.192 line:15% 
<v ->So maybe computers and the human potential will be</v>

734
00:29:04.192 --> 00:29:06.132 line:15% 
mimicking each other more than we understand right now.

735
00:29:06.132 --> 00:29:08.372 line:15% 
<v ->Well, remember that a lot of science fiction</v>

736
00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:09.812 line:15% 
is predicated on the idea that

737
00:29:09.812 --> 00:29:12.223 line:15% 
we eventually outdo ourselves.

738
00:29:12.223 --> 00:29:14.250 line:15% 
I mean the whole Terminator series

739
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.414 line:15% 
and a lot of stories like this show that

740
00:29:16.414 --> 00:29:19.007 line:15% 
we are pretty efficient as creatures,

741
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.790 line:15% 
but we're just about adept to be able

742
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.646 line:15% 
to make creatures which are a lot smarter

743
00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:26.761 line:15% 
and more adept than we are, especially

744
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:28.104 line:15% 
if you get a system which is able to outthink us

745
00:29:28.104 --> 00:29:30.558 line:15% 
by millions or billions of times.

746
00:29:30.558 --> 00:29:33.118 line:15% 
If you're able to do that, it would accelerate

747
00:29:33.118 --> 00:29:36.563 line:15% 
things so fast that we could put ourselves out of business.

748
00:29:36.563 --> 00:29:38.696 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well, possibly, but is it possible</v>

749
00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:41.138 line:15% 
that we have that same innate capability?

750
00:29:41.138 --> 00:29:43.879 line:15% 
<v ->I think we probably do have that ability.</v>

751
00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:48.338 line:15% 
It's not clear that we're able to escape our...

752
00:29:50.118 --> 00:29:52.828 line:15% 
heritage, our evolutionary heritage.

753

You know, you almost need to like start over again.

754
00:29:55.665 --> 00:29:58.065 line:15% 
So if we have the capability of designing something

755
00:29:58.065 --> 00:29:59.792 line:15% 
which has all of the good parts of us,

756
00:29:59.792 --> 00:30:02.428 line:15%
