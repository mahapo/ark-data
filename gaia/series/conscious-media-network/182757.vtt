00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I also took an
interest in this story

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
because her work indicates
that astrologically the United

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:84%
States is entering a time
of great crisis, crisis

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that can bring about
great revolution,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:90%
leading to deep healing.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
After our last conversation,
it became really clear to me

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that we had a lot
more talking to do.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really intrigued
with this notion

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the astrological
overlay with the yugas

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and the Mayan calendar
to see that-- and even

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.045 align:middle line:84%
Hopi prophecy and legend--
to see that this is a cycle.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
which way you slice it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:90%
and which discipline you go to.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.887 align:middle line:90%
We're in a very important cycle.

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about--

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --how they
intercept or overlay.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There's just-- it's
extraordinary the kind of cycle

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:90%
overlay we have.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.715 align:middle line:90%
When you consider--

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
of your listeners

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
remember the big deal about
the harmonic convergence.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> In 1987.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --big deal.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> That was kind of an
introduction of an ancient

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
symbolic system popularized by
JosÃ© Arguelles to the American

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:90%
public.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They had never probably
thought of looking ahead.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And 2012 was this key date
that he sort of emblazoned

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
in everybody's brain who
was hip to his information.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of the Mayans,
this ancient civilization who--

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
through means we have no
idea of how they did it--

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
were able to calculate these
epical cycles called baktuns.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Who were able, again, through
whether it was mathematics

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
or I personally believe that
they had a way of intuiting

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
that we just can't
possibly know,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
that was more psycho-spiritual
than merely mathematical,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:90%
but it was mathematical too.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And their pronouncements, which
are right there in stone--

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
they're nobody's
speculation-- are

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that there was this baktun
that started in 3102 BC.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar that many
scholars agree on was this one,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's ending on exactly
December, I think its 21, 2012.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So 2012 is right
smack in the middle

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
of this astrological
configuration

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about last time.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The years 2009 to 2014 are
the span of the grand cross,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
as it's called.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So you have the Mayan calendar,
which has this end date

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%
right in the middle of that.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Does this feed into the
Galactic Center and the yuga

00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:20.105 align:middle line:90%
cycles--

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.255 align:middle line:90%
The Galactic Center--

00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:23.415 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the 26,000 years,
precession of equinox?

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> --is such an
interesting piece of it.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It's another clue that the
Mayans were on to something

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that we only have this
tiniest little piece when

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
we try to pick their brain,
historically, pre-historically.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You see that the
Galactic Center, which

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is the astronomical
core of the Milky Way

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
has an actual zodiacal range
of 29 degree, this edge, 29

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:90%
degree.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Gemini is the axis that
the Galactic Center

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
is known to be on.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And for the Mayans,
they had this rich lore

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%
that it was the cosmic vulva.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about
it as this point,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
sort of a portal
of consciousness,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that we might psycho-spiritually
think of as a entry point where

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
super conscious information
can flow through

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:90%
into the human mind.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic
Center just happens

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.065 align:middle line:84%
to be where Pluto was
when it entered Capricorn.

00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:32.865 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll be talking about
the significance of that?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --at that point.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Talking about that, but you see
it's another way that Western

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
astrology has been getting
hints from this distant past,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
from this civilization
that we can barely fathom

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
how they knew what they knew.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But the facts are so
astoundingly correlative.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic
Center is thought

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to be an indicator among
Western astrologers

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of this massive quantum leap,
not just small little changes

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
of understanding-- which of
course, all transits even

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
the dinky little
quick transits are

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
about changes of understanding.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what transits are for--

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
but these mega cycles that
people like the Mayans

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
were into, and people
like the ancient Indians

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
were into, who developed
a yuga system whose

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
cycles that they tracked
were even longer,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.016 align:middle line:90%
half a million years.

00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:90%
A yuga is 432,000 years long.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So some scholars imagine
that the Kali Yuga,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
which many people have heard
of, which translates roughly

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
to the dark time,
started way back then.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Right about the time
that the Mayan calendar

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
began at around 3100 BC.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
outrageous overlaps.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Coincidences.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it seemed to me that
the interesting question would

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
be what do you do when you
try to figure out the last day

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
of Mayan calendar, a calendar
this huge that it dwarfs all

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:84%
our preconceptions
of linear time?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have to point
out at this point

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
dealing with linear time.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
They were dealing
with circular time.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendars
were circles.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to qualify
that they weren't circles

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of they
started at a certain point

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and then went round
through the cycle

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and came back at the
exact same point.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They came back at a point at a
higher level of consciousness.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:90%
This was their world view.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a circle,
it was a spiral.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Every time a yuga
or a Mayan baktun,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
which is this 5,000
year chunk came back,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:90%
it came back at a higher level.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is way of
seeing astrology.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
It is not repeating.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Although like an
onion, it's coming back

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to the same place in
terms of parallel--

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's evolving.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's evolving.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, revealing.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's evolving.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And the cycles give us a
hint about the subject matter

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:90%
that's evolving.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know
what was happening

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of this baktun.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
If 2012 is the end of it,
what were the auspices of it?

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And you go back and some
of the research that--

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Eric Francis is an
astrologer, who's

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:84%
done a wonderful
amount of scholarship

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
on this, if any
of your listeners

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:90%
want to get into it further--

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
you find that back then
in like 3,000 years BC,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
there were evidences
of a great flood.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Which is kind of--

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
geological evidences

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that we could point to
in terms of hard facts,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.725 align:middle line:84%
but I think even
more significantly

00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
there was this archetype
of the great flood, which

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol of a
wipeout of civilization.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We know this from
Judeo-Christian archetypes.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this idea that
there was this massive wipeout.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But isn't this also
chronicled in many,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:90%
many indigenous--

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The Hopis, as you said.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm most familiar with
them, but I totally see it

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.761 align:middle line:90%
as a universal phenomenon.

00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:37.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the great deluge.

00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The timings are too acutely,
yes, lined up to not be so.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Pick an ancient
civilization, and you

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:90%
will find these similarities.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So then we get to
Western astrology

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and we get to this
grand cross in the sky,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
which just happened to be
inaugurated if you consider

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that last January 25, Pluto's
ingress into Capricorn

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
was sort of the
beginning of this phase.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It just happened to be conjunct
with the Galactic Center, which

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans have told us is
a suggestion of a quantum

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
leap of human consciousness.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Kali Yuga which
predicted very specifically--

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and of course, they unlike us,
have kept all their records.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.775 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so wonderful.

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It's so troubling
about the CD-type of--

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, the plastic
and the cybernetic way

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of composing information, I
have very little faith in.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't beat stone.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got stone records that
are indicating that their wise

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
people, their shamans predicted
such things as the corruption

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
en masse of leaders and
the pollution of the planet

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.425 align:middle line:84%
to the point-- they use
different phrases for it,

00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
but this is what
they're saying--

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing less than a
total wipeout and new beginning

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:90%
would be called for.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And the cycles are
so big that I think

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
we have to back up
from our understandings

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of conventional astrology.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Not to dismiss
the value actually

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of, what I call
pop astrology, just incredibly

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:90%
good at typing personalities.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It's better than any
Myers-Briggs test or any kind

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of sociological typing
system I've ever

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:90%
heard of in terms of accuracy.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But I'm making a
discrimination here

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
between that kind of
astrology, which has its place,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and the type which is
going to help us understand

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
what our epoch is up to.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So there are Western
astrologers, as well as

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
these ancients we've
been talking about,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
who will also deal in like
26,000 year cycles, which

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
is called a great year, and
it's based on the precession

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
It can get very
technical, but it

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
has to do astronomically
with a set of facts that

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
happened because the
Earth is not a sphere,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:90%
it has a wobble to it.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So that when it goes
around every year,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
it comes back at the spring
equinox to a point just shy

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.142 align:middle line:84%
of where it started
the year before.

00:11:34.142 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about this?

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we have a couple
interviews on our site--

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Walter Cruttenden doing some--

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --astounding new work
on it, John Major Jenkins,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.793 align:middle line:90%
and a couple others.

00:11:41.793 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so glad because then I
don't have to talk about it.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Just the general point of this
is that the bigger the cycles,

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
the more information you
get from a perspective,

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:90%
the big picture.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
looking at, for example,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
individual political
administrations and the kinds

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
of things that the media we
have keeps us focused on,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
it's such a tiny
little attention span.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And don't even get
me started on that.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is a
crime against intellect.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.395 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that we
don't need to go into that.

00:12:23.395 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We won't go into
that, but we all know it.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.728 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's
something very

00:12:26.728 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
wrong with human
intelligence being

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
confined to like barely
little five-year chunks

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And even worse to the
sound bite of the day.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The sound bite of the
day, and the young people not

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:90%
knowing history.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're going
back to prehistory

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
when we start to talk
about metaphysical systems

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
like astrology, like
the Indian yuga system

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:90%
and like the Mayan calendar.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have to back
up, and we find

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that our intelligences start
to widen when they do that.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And we find that the
silly partisanship

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
of what most people
think of when

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:84%
they hear the word politics,
doesn't apply anymore.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It sounds a little
absurd, in fact,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
even to talk about
good and bad when

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you think about the
demise of the dinosaurs.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Because so much time
has passed between--

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm just giving
that as an example--

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
huge geological shifts that
happened on the earth's crust.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
These don't make us
all upset and fretting.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they
happened so long ago

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and they are viewed from
such a huge big picture.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But the ways that the
telecommunications industry--

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid-- is a great
player in this dumbing-down

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, the way that
they focus, as you say,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
on this sound bite way of having
us look at what's going on

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
in the world, it disallows that
kind of compassionate distance

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
that the shamans
of old held, and

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
that some Western astrologers
who look at enormous cycles

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
hold.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So that instead of getting
so paralyzed with panic

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and despair at the thought
of a certain country

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
know rising and
falling, we start

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to see the earth
as a body that's

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:90%
been around for a long time.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Look at the perspective,
for example,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
Indians must have

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
had to know about when they
talked about a half a million

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:90%
year cycle.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at where we're
going in terms of that, instead

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
of a four-year election cycle.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, the business that
even savvy political pundits

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
in this country have,
the ones who know that--

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
if you know American
history even

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and you see how young
this country is, I mean,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
it's just in diapers
when you consider

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.583 align:middle line:84%
these immensely long
civilizations that

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
knew what they
were talking about,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:90%
that left the stone tablets.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
You really-- it's not that
you don't take it seriously.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It's tragically
serious, but you also

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
take it with this
bit of detachment

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
that helps us see the meaning.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Might we even say we're in
the terrible twos right now?

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I think
that's a good one.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:90%
We're in the terrible twos.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And the tragedy of the ignorance
of not seeing how young we are

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and getting all caught up
in this day-to-day nonsense,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and not even remembering about
Iran-Contra so that you-- how

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.273 align:middle line:84%
can you interpret
the nonsense that's

00:15:55.273 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
going on in Washington now if
you don't even remember that

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:90%
far back?

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I talk
about politics,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I really kind of wince at the
narrow way it's looked at.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
redeem that word.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're looking more
at like a meta-politics?

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a good
way of saying it.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, we could say that you
have to go back to its roots.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, "polis" meant
city, and the idea

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of power,
the science of power

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
plays that were conducted
mostly in cities,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the
pagan or country

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
folk that were just harvesting,
and that was their life.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
what politics is in,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:84%
in the classical sense of
the word is what I'm saying,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
we can back up from the
hyped up little, really,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
manufactured dramas
that we see on TV

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and start to consider where the
real power shifts are going on.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, the
planet Pluto governs power.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a key
player now, right now?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now because
it's made an ingress.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.039 align:middle line:90%
It's done one of its--

00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
it takes 250 years, on average,
to go around the chart,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
so whenever it changes
signs, as we spoke up before,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
it's a very big deal.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
That's one reason
it's a big deal.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The other is because
when it did this ingress,

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:90%
it did so conjunct.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
That means lined up with
the Galactic Center.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:90%
So in a way, do you see?

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:90%
You use the imagery of that.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Just imagining the idea of
our galaxy having a center,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and that a transit or
a shift of placement

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
of this slow moving planet
is like a celestial arrow

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.925 align:middle line:84%
flashing, pointing to
the Galactic Center.

00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of
what transits are.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:90%
They're saying look at this.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
All of this goes to say that
this threshold that we've

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
crossed is not
ordinary, even in terms

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:84%
of Pluto's long [INAUDIBLE]
cycle, it's not ordinary.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we start--

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I want to talk
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.353 align:middle line:84%
>> --looking at what some of the
effects are then because even

00:18:14.353 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
though we have viewers from
120, 130 countries watching this

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
interview, and I hate to be so
focused on the United States

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:84%
as a rule in what we're
doing here on CMN,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
but this is really critical,
this information now

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
because what impacts the United
States in this way and the way

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
in which we respond to it
is going to certainly have

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
a ripple effect
around the world.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no accident that
the USA has become the only

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:90%
hyperpower.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had to
invent a whole new word,

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
hyperpower, to even describe
the distinction between the kind

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
of power this country has
and the kind of powers

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.542 align:middle line:90%
the other countries have.

00:18:57.542 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And that tells you something.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, as
I metaphysician,

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anything is
an accident, nothing is.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Not anything.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
the USA leads, we

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
see as sort of karmically
ordained, and its follies

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:84%
as well as its
immense potentials,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:90%
which are also in its chart.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
this last time.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:84%
They are a model for
the world for a reason,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
for a set of complex,
karmic reasons.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
the planet Pluto--

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I see as the key to
the chart of the USA.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Different astrologers have
very different takes on it.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them use, for
example, the chart of the USA,

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.690 align:middle line:90%
but I use the Sibly chart.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of controversy surrounds
the very birth moment

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:90%
of the USA.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But since it's such
a young country,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
it is easier than with
most civilizations

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to take a birth date and
to create a chart from it.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the planet Pluto
is the key, in my opinion,

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.765 align:middle line:84%
is where we start
when we look at power.

00:20:07.765 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:84%
The USA is going to have what's
called a Pluto return in 2022.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It happens that in
the chart of the USA,

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:84%
which we read sort of like we
would read the chart of you

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:84%
or me, we find that it's
in the house of money,

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:90%
the house of resources.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> That shouldn't
surprise any of us.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And even when you
back up from the idea

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
of the American obsession
with money and consumerism,

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
you look at the higher
implications of that,

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and you see that
it's a world teaching

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
about right use of resources.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And that because the USA is too
young to have ever had a Pluto

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
return before, meaning
that we haven't

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
been around long enough
as a country for there

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to have been this 2
and 1/2 century cycle

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to complete itself,
to come home,

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
this 2022 transit,
the Pluto return,

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the first
time that the USA has

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
had to look at its relationship
with the material plane, which

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
includes materialism,
which includes the way

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
we use resources, which
includes the way we exploit, now

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
especially under
globalization the resources

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of the world.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
All of it will be
in our face then.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And leading up to
it, we have all kinds

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of clues with the cardinal
cross about the years

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
just up ahead that are
going to make us look

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:90%
at the responsibility of power.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk about
that, the cross?

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> For one thing,
this recession that--

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I call it a
proto-recession-- that

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
has just now been
made public, but you

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
know, prescient observers
have been talking about it

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:90%
for years, Jimmy Carter, even.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
He seems like such
an old fogey now.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
He's one of those guys that were
so underappreciated in his time

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
because he made the
other leaders look

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:90%
so bad by comparison.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
people remember this.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
He had a whole
infrastructure set up

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in his administration to study
alternate means of energy.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to get us
away from fossil fuels

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
way back then.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
He had a think tank in Colorado
that had solar roofing.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And Ronald Reagan came
along and, of course,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
defunded it, and shut
the whole thing down.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Even to the point of
stripping the solar panels

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:90%
off the roof of that building.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's symbolic.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
this thing is new.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:84%
The visionaries have
all seen it coming.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller
saw it coming.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk in astrology
about the outer planet cycles,

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
we talk about when
something moves

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
from the layer of
mass unconsciousness

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and breaks up through
the threshold,

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
almost like through the earth's
crust, a telluric event,

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:90%
into a mass consciousness.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
These are the types of events
that we study when we look at,

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, Saturn
was opposed to Neptune

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:90%
for the past three years.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
This was when Al Gore's
prescient material

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:90%
about global warming--

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.780 align:middle line:84%
again, not that it hadn't been
heard of in certain circles,

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
but that's when it broke
through into the mass mind.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have this
Saturn-Neptune opposition

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:90%
to thank for that.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I have detail about this in my
daykeeperjournal.com article,

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:84%
so I won't go into
detail about that.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We're on the wane with
the Saturn-Neptune now,

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but it was a precursor to the
years we're coming up with,

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:90%
coming upon ahead.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to
understand the grand cross

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
is to see, as with all transit
cycles, what just happened.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
These three years
that just happened

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
took the idea of mass
global climate change

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and forced it into the
first world's face.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So that said, we have a
complete shift in the zeitgeist.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in three years is like
a ridiculously small amount

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:84%
of time for there to be such
an immense change in people's

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.225 align:middle line:84%
thinking, and that
can only happen,

00:24:51.225 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
astrologically
speaking, when you

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:90%
have these types of transits.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So that is a
precursor to what?

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a precursor,
first of all,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that when
Pluto moved into Capricorn,

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and this is--

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And this was just--

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, January 25, it
made its first ingress,

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
but it's complicated because the
calendar year of 2008 is going

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to see Pluto going back and
forth into the last degrees

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:84%
of Sagittarius, hitting
the Galactic Center again,

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
and again, and again.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it through a
retrograde process?

00:25:29.753 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Retrograde direct motion,
yes, does this little dance.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have a whole
year of it sort of--

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that kind of like boom,
boom over the head repeatedly?

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think
that there's a reason.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.507 align:middle line:90%
I maybe anthropomorphizing--

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we're slow learners?

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> --the planets a little bit,
but I do see them as having

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:90%
an intelligence.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And like you or I
would, if we were really

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:84%
trying to get something through
to a very hard-headed planetary

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
populace, we would
teach it again and again

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:90%
until they got it.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are we being
taught again and again now?

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, there is this
idea that these transits go

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:90%
in sequence.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.983 align:middle line:84%
Now, we just got done with 13
years of Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:26:16.983 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to repeat
myself from our last interview,

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
but to sum that up, we
had 13 years of where

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
issues of religion, and belief,
and hope, and the idea of

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
is nothing sacred was
put through the ringer.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And these are meaning
systems, which

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
gave hope and faith to
millions and millions of people

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
were just eviscerated.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of faith at all
had to be completely rethought.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Things that were heresies
before became front page news

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
from all of the Judeo-Christian,
Islamic traditions.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
All of them have this.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Pluto does,
it takes the most unsavory

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and the most taboo, seamy
underside of whatever sign

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.150 align:middle line:84%
it's in and exposes it
to the light of day.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So we did that to the issue
of sacralization and religion

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
for 13 years.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And now it's going to
do it to the things

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
government and corporations, all
the things Capricorn governs,

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:90%
it will do it to them.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, anti-war
activists and people

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
who look at the seamy
underside of government

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
rather than what you'll
hear on the broadcast news

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
know that there are sort of
two separate realities in terms

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
of what, at least
Americans, are taught.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going back to the USA
charts, Pluto, as we said,

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's paradigmatic for
what the rest of the world

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
is going to be learning
in the years ahead.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
canary in the mine.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We have here the idea
that we have a democracy,

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and we learn this
in books as kids.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And democracy, by the way, is
governed by the planet Uranus,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with of
the people, by the people,

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:90%
for the people.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The idea of individuals
being in charge.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:90%
That is a Uranian idea.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So traditionally,
the planet Uranus

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
has been associated with
the idea of democracy.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And as astronomers
know, the planet Uranus

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
was literally sighted in the sky
right when the telescopes that

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
were able to see
it were invented,

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:84%
between the American
and French Revolutions.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Again, no accident.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So the whole concept of
revolution of the people rising

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
up is a Uranian archetype.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Pluto, the planet of power--

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and the seamy underside,
the ugly truth,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:84%
which has to be confronted
before real change can happen--

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is in a relationship
with Uranus in the sky.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:84%
This will peak from
the years 2010 to 2012.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're on the
on-ramp of it now.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And we will be on the on-ramp
of it for years after that,

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.750 align:middle line:90%
after 2012.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I'm setting up.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
overcomplicated,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:90%
so reel me in if I am.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The planet of raw power, not
appearances, but what's really

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
going on is in this
90 degree angle,

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
which in astrology
signifies extremely tense,

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:90%
something has to give energy.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> A square.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> A square, meaning a
quarter of the zodiac,

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
with the planet Uranus, which
is people, human beings.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.110 align:middle line:90%
People power.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember right
before shock and awe

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
when "The New York Times" made
that fabulous headline that

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.200 align:middle line:90%
really summed it up?

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It said there are now two
superpowers in the world,

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
the United States government--

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm paraphrasing a little bit--

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:90%
and world public opinion.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a prescient
statement in a nutshell

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:90%
of Pluto square Uranus.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is the most significant
arm of this grand cross

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.810 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the arm of it that
establishes its base meaning.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the trenches,
what does this mean?

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.192 align:middle line:84%
On the on-ramp during
and on the off-ramp?

00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
the on-ramp first.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the
on-ramp, where we are right now.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
What we have in this
sheer unmitigated malarkey

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that passes for political
discourse in America

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:84%
is that one party in this
duopolistic system, which

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
is rigged--

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have to put
in a little sideline here.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.495 align:middle line:90%
I just can't help it.

00:31:25.495 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a duopoly
here, it seems

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to go by without
anybody's notice.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
it's not allowed

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:84%
for somebody who doesn't fit
one of these two extremely

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
rigid patterns of the two
political parties that

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
have gotten that Good
Housekeeping seal of approval,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:84%
like Ralph Nader, should
become this massive scapegoat

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:84%
for dumping all of
our disaffection, all

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of our disillusion of
the political system on.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how that
would have messed

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:84%
with the minds of
the Founding Fathers

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:84%
if they had heard
of such a thing.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't they have said,
this is the whole point,

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to have varied voices who bring
up things, not to silence them,

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
not to keep them out
of debates, like they

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.370 align:middle line:90%
refused Dennis Kucinich.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And Ron Paul.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, all of them.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, that game is rigged.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
is unfortunately

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
a mass media, which is an
arm of the government, which

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
is exactly echoing the stated
reality, not the Plutonian one.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's--

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The stated reality, I want
to give him two words to is that

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:84%
this one political party
is for phase withdrawal,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and the other political party
is for staying the course

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and protecting
American interests.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And people repeat
this to the extent

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that there's any
political debate at all.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
They kind of use
these buzz words

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:90%
as if they meant anything.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The Plutonian reality is that
the American powers that be

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
have no interest
in giving up Iraq.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
An insider in
Washington has darkly

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
joked they'd rather
give up Washington DC

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:90%
than give up the--

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --Persian Gulf.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Wouldn't be investing in
all those permanent bases

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:90%
otherwise.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:90%
16 permanent bases.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And to call them permanent
is not a speculative adjective.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They're officially
called permanent bases.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:90%
You know all this.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many of your
listeners are aware that the--

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> A fair number.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> --embassy being built
in Baghdad is the biggest

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me again
about withdrawal?

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be 50,000
to 100,000 counterterrorism

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.570 align:middle line:84%
personnel that are left in
Iraq after the troops have

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:90%
supposedly been withdrawn.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And these are the very guys,
these CIA-trained guys who

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:84%
will be left there,
are the ones who

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:84%
still have blood on their
hands from counter-insurgency

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:84%
campaigns in Latin America, as
well as way back to the Phoenix

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
program in South Vietnam,
whose modus operandi was

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.487 align:middle line:90%
to assassinate populist leaders.

00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
These are the guys
who are going to be

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:84%
minding the store after
the troops have supposedly

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:90%
withdrawn.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.159 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is exactly what
we should expect, isn't it?

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:84%
With these kinds
of squares and--

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> At the moment what
I'm suggesting is that

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the Plutonian reality is
what we're talking about,

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.100 align:middle line:90%
what's really happening.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> What's really happening now--

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Not what's in the newspapers.

00:34:40.343 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK, yeah.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.649 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really happening
is actually it's not a secret

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can have access
to this information.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:51.719 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
cultural defined reality.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.582 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the underbelly
you were speaking of.

00:34:53.582 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the underbelly.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> The real energy.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the truth.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the facts.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's reflective of Pluto.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That's reflective of Pluto,
which has to do with follow

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:90%
the power and follow--

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Follow the money, right.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --the money, which in the
USA chart are one and the same

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.380 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the USA equation of money
with power has been exported.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:21.627 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, it's now the MO of
the first world, in general--

00:35:21.627 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And seeping into-

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --but we find its auspices
in the USA, generally.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Say again?

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And seeping into the
third world as well.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.700 align:middle line:84%
As China becomes
the next mimicker

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.030 align:middle line:90%
of this dread trajectory.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's go back to
this idea of what's really

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:84%
happening, the
Plutonian reality.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.680 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:84%
By definition, nobody likes
to look at Pluto stuff.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Pluto governs the
process of decay.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Quite literally, it
governs what happens

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to a peach that's allowed
to rot on your fruit basket

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and get all slimy
and start to stink.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, if we back
up from that ick factor,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:84%
we get that that's the
only way to expose the pit.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Putrefaction has a
role to play in nature.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And that pit will presumably
find its way into the ground,

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have a new
peach tree next season.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
say about Plutonian

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
power and its
governance of rot is

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that it's leading to
rebirth in the same way

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that that peach
pit was, but it has

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
to go through this
extremely unpleasant phase

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:90%
first, which is breakdown.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So decay and breakdown, we're
going to expect, of all things,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:90%
capricornian.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Back to what we
were talking about,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Capricorn governs governments.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.685 align:middle line:84%
It governs governments,
in particular,

00:36:52.685 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:84%
it governs the
notion of government.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What about economic systems?

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It governs
economic systems too.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It governs-- what it's going to
blow the lid off of when Pluto

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:84%
was in Capricorn-- which is
to expose the rot, right--

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is the extent to which business
interests that are so much more

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:84%
powerful that they're more
powerful than heads of state

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:84%
anymore have merged
with what we think

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:84%
of as our executive and
judicial and legislative branch,

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:90%
the stuff we learned in school.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead, it's
a corporatocracy.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead of a plutocracy,
that is the reality.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Little by little, what's
happening with Pluto

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in Capricorn over the
next couple of years

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is that the reality
is going to come up

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:48.780 align:middle line:84%
into a clash with the received
wisdom, the stuff you hear

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
on the news, the stuff they're
probably still teaching

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
in junior high and civic
classes, which is so immensely

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, I want to
make this very clear.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I talk about in my book
how the idea of democracy

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:84%
was really fated to reach a
superlative level in this group

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:17.310 align:middle line:84%
entity we call the
USA, potentially.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:84%
That potential is the light
at the end of the tunnel here.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But the Pluto process, which
must expose the inauthenticity

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
in any given entity,
like the US government,

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:84%
has to go through this
rot process first,

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we're watching.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is with this Pluto
square Uranus in the years

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Attention, all square aspects
denote a kind of attention

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.380 align:middle line:84%
that has to give, it
has to break down.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Something has to pop
between the actual reality,

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:07.020 align:middle line:84%
which is that we have
people, business leaders from

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:84%
the defense-contracting industry
moving right into government

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:84%
positions, like old Dick Cheney,
and Condoleezza Rice who slid--

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.620 align:middle line:84%
without protest
at all basically,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.280 align:middle line:84%
except from this
knowing cognoscente--

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:84%
who slid effortlessly
from big oil

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.940 align:middle line:84%
right into in these
immense positions

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:84%
of official statecraft, to
the point where you have--

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in the years that followed,
in the last eight years--

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.580 align:middle line:84%
you've had foreign
policy literally being

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:84%
dictated by the energy industry,
and the press can't even

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
get the minutes
of these meetings

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:90%
that Cheney had with them.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Congress doesn't
even have a clue.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So this would have
been so unthinkable

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to the original crafters of
the people, by the people,

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
for the people idea of what's
supposed to be going on

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in this government.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:84%
The distinction, the discrepancy
between business leaders

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of scope and
Halliburton moves to Dubai now,

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.120 align:middle line:84%
so there's not even
any pretense that they

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:84%
have a nationalistic loyalty
towards this country.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You have this idea of
the business government

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.320 align:middle line:84%
merger coming to a
head to the point

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:84%
where it is not
going to be allowed

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:90%
to maintain a status quo.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This is where I talk
about the sickness.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think of the stuff
that's going on in the USA

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:43.890 align:middle line:90%
as evil.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think of it as
one side against another.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I see it as a fated illness.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that my use of the
phrase cognitive dissonance

00:40:55.890 --> 00:41:01.320 align:middle line:84%
isn't clinically exact because
I had a shrink friend of mine

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.480 align:middle line:84%
telling me I was using
it wrong, but you know,

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.650 align:middle line:84%
the way that the phrase
is used in the vernacular

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.530 align:middle line:90%
indicates that there are--

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.650 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible for the brain
to function in a healthy way

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.940 align:middle line:84%
when there are two such
divergent realities being

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.060 align:middle line:90%
hit upon it at once.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
happening in the USA.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We have little
children and adults

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
who cherish the idea that
they got in grade five

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:84%
about what's supposed
to be going on

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:90%
in our great democracy.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the leaders
use the word like a sound bite,

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.050 align:middle line:90%
like Pavlov's dog--

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:84%
"democracy," and "freedom"
to reinforce this idea

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:90%
in one part of our mass brain.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of our
mass brain, we have what's

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.140 align:middle line:84%
really going on, which is that
companies like Halliburton

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:84%
are reaping obscene
amounts of money

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:04.260 align:middle line:84%
from the most hideous, tragic
desecration of whole countries.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And a person can't
function healthfully

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.230 align:middle line:84%
when they've got these two
realities fighting each other.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:90%
A person goes a little crazy.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm suggesting in my
book, "Soul-Sick Nation"

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that the country is a little
crazy right now from this.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that-- and that would
be when we turn to any kind

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.360 align:middle line:84%
of mind-number, whether
it is Prozac or media,

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:90%
or whatever thing--

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> --distracts us.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you bring up, but
I do think that television is

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:43.980 align:middle line:84%
the single most numbing,
dangerous agent of sickness

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:90%
in the modern world.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course it has its
electronic counterparts,

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:84%
but as we know the
internet as this saving

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.980 align:middle line:84%
grace, chaotic factor
that the powers that be

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.270 align:middle line:84%
have not discovered
yet how to control,

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:90%
that television does not.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of
the consolidation

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of the telecommunication
industry.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:10.440 align:middle line:84%
People forget that there was
a time when the airwaves were

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:90%
thought to be free.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:16.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what the FCC was supposed
to champion and maintain.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.840 align:middle line:84%
That they were of
the people, that they

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.940 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be bought and sold.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's another subset of
this cognitive dissonance.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
a sick country, we

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.960 align:middle line:84%
have people taking, as you
say, all kinds of drugs.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We're just base
basically coping.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What the square
between Pluto--

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.055 align:middle line:84%
which is going to force the
ugly realities into our face--

00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.680 align:middle line:84%
square to Uranus,
which is the content

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:52.300 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of democracy and
the idea of what the people are

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:84%
really thinking, there's
going to be a sort

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:90%
of cognitive dissonance crisis.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:90%
This is how I see it.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And people say, oh,
that sounds terrible.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to go
back to this idea

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:90%
that the ancient Chinese used.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a cliche now,
they define the word "crisis"

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:90%
as dangerous opportunity.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think we should back
away from the idea of crisis.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.150 align:middle line:84%
If we see it in this
value judgment free sense,

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:90%
yes, it's going to be a crisis.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Stuff is going to
break down that has

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to break down if we're going
to be free from the sickness.

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can see the
breakdown already beginning.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it in our
individual character.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing anger rampant
in every form everywhere.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Escape.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Escapism.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Escapism, we're seeing our
economy is starting to take

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:51.610 align:middle line:84%
a serious downward dive,
even publicly, a little.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's been a
factor, and these factors

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.200 align:middle line:84%
have been there a long time,
but now there's no secret.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Now there's no secret.

00:44:57.373 --> 00:45:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the big few that own the
media are allowing them to talk

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:06.130 align:middle line:84%
about it, so we're seeing this
go into crisis which certainly

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.440 align:middle line:84%
is going to have to require
some kind of reaction,

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or restructuring
at the very least.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you take
this into politics?

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What you're going to get is
that it's no longer going to be

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.450 align:middle line:84%
tenable to keep the real
truth of what's going on.

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's just use Iraq, although
it's all over the world.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the most obvious, so let's
use it as the core example.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.950 align:middle line:84%
What's really going on in
Iraq, which is, as we say,

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.155 align:middle line:84%
that all the
military shenanigans,

00:45:35.155 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
they are probably just going
to be now called paramilitary.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being
called our brave GIs,

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.170 align:middle line:84%
they're probably just going to
be called security personnel.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.870 align:middle line:84%
But there's still going to
be 100,000 of them left.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.300 align:middle line:84%
That core ugly
reality, it's going

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.870 align:middle line:84%
to be kind of a low profile
dirty war of the type

00:45:55.870 --> 00:46:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that the USA used to design
for Latin America, versus what

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.810 align:middle line:84%
is promoted and discussed
in these faux debates

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.170 align:middle line:90%
that we get on television.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:12.280 align:middle line:84%
That the tension
between those two

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.560 align:middle line:84%
is symbolized by the
Pluto-Uranus square

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:90%
will have to break.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if it
were a human being,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.520 align:middle line:84%
we might call that a
psychotic breakdown.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
What's happening, because
Pluto is in the second house,

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is that the economics of it
are both the first part of it

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of rearing its head,
the first part of the breakdown

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:90%
that's rearing its ugly head--

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Bankrupting the country.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Bankruptcy, the home
market bubble bursting.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Well even, just the
money that's being siphoned

00:46:45.032 --> 00:46:46.615 align:middle line:84%
into the military
industrial complex--

00:46:46.615 --> 00:46:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is--

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --is bankrupting the country.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the bigger point.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but how
people could have

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:90%
not put 2 and 2 together that--

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.540 align:middle line:84%
what $3 trillion of Iraq
war money could have bought?

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:06.940 align:middle line:84%
While meanwhile, national
parks are being auctioned off

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.245 align:middle line:90%
for $1 and $2 million.

00:47:08.245 --> 00:47:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your listeners may
be better than me at this,

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't actually
hold in my brain what

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:90%
$3 trillion looks like.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.020 align:middle line:84%
It's too big for me
to even contemplate.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:21.820 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That is a lot.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I heard that if
you stretch dollar bills,

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:29.200 align:middle line:84%
it would go all the way to
the moon and back six times.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't
fathom amounts this big

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that are being pumped in
to these hideous ways.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But economists even should know.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have to
be a metaphysical thinker,

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.230 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to be a peacenik.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Hardcore pencil pushers know
that military spending is one

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of the forms of deficit
spending that cannot go back

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.770 align:middle line:90%
into the economy.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
By its very
definition, will never

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.830 align:middle line:84%
benefit the country
that's doing it.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.573 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go back
again to the real Plutonian

00:48:06.573 --> 00:48:07.990 align:middle line:84%
truth, the stuff
that people don't

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.030 align:middle line:84%
like to look at anymore
than they like to look

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.840 align:middle line:90%
at maggots on roadkill--

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.190 align:middle line:90%
which Pluto also governs--

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:18.220 align:middle line:90%
which is that Halliburton--

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:84%
just the symbol, Bechtel,
there are a million of them.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, there are
not a million of them,

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.663 align:middle line:84%
but there's several
of them, but we're

00:48:25.663 --> 00:48:29.130 align:middle line:84%
going to use Halliburton
because it's the best known,

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:32.830 align:middle line:84%
is making money hand over
fist and nobody else,

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.230 align:middle line:90%
nobody else is making money.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So military spending by its
definition, defense contractor

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.640 align:middle line:84%
spending and the
nuclear arsenal that we

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.810 align:middle line:84%
are retrofitting, which
will, again, presumably be

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:90%
outmoded in a couple of years.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So that money too
is down the toilet.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Military spending
by its definition

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is one of the types
of spending that is

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.080 align:middle line:90%
going to have to be rethought.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think because,
as you say, it's

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:06.250 align:middle line:84%
so obvious, it's so out in the
open, how many millions would

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:84%
it have cost to repair, for
example, all those levees that

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:90%
weren't repaired in Louisiana?

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Probably a couple
of hour's worth of--

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have the
statistics, but I

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.510 align:middle line:84%
can't call them to mind right
now, but a couple of hour's

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:90%
worth of the war in Iraq.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I think that
people aren't connecting

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:84%
the dots on this,
because, as you say,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.600 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't be more obvious,
is because we're sick.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.630 align:middle line:90%
We're numb.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think--

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:37.972 align:middle line:84%
>> We've lost our
power of the logic.

00:49:37.972 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, we don't know how.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The problems appear to
be so vast in nature

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that I think that
part of the sickness

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is feeling as though
we have absolutely

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.770 align:middle line:90%
no control over the situation.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is where we
get back to Uranus.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This is where Uranus comes
in, the power of the people.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Uranus square Pluto.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Pluto is raw, amoral power.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not evil, it just doesn't
have any morals at all.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not immoral because
it doesn't have any morals.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And it is the kind of
destructive functioning

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:84%
when it's used
without consciousness.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I have to qualify that.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It's natural law that's
been twisted and distorted

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:84%
by human beings not
understanding it.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the version of Pluto
we're up against here, not just

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Pluto.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, so when that's up against--

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I keep doing this because
I see in my mind's eye

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.310 align:middle line:90%
that square and the heavens--

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.200 align:middle line:84%
when that's up
against this world

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.620 align:middle line:84%
public opinion "The New
York Times" talked about,

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.500 align:middle line:84%
millions and millions of
people all over the world

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.710 align:middle line:84%
protested before shock
and awe happened.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It was the biggest mass
demonstration in Spain,

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.810 align:middle line:84%
for example, that it hit the
Guinness Book of World Records.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Including in the US, though
we were shielded from that

00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:59.920 align:middle line:90%
truth by the media.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh, of course, yeah.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Although those of us
in the peace movement

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:84%
were astounded by
all the major cities

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.855 align:middle line:84%
in the world, all at the same
time, under the full moon--

00:51:09.855 --> 00:51:10.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:51:10.655 --> 00:51:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> --pouring into the streets.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.140 align:middle line:90%
This is Uranus.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.007 align:middle line:90%
Now, Uranus square to Pluto--

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:19.090 align:middle line:84%
just on the face of it,
even if we weren't looking

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:22.960 align:middle line:84%
at the particular facts of
the geopolitical situation

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.240 align:middle line:90%
that we know about--

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.180 align:middle line:84%
if we were going straight
from the astrology book

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and trying to see what
the symbols in the raw

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:35.530 align:middle line:84%
might indicate, we would
say that the powers that

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.550 align:middle line:84%
be in their status
quo control hold

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:43.165 align:middle line:84%
are going to be in a pitched
battle against the people.

00:51:43.165 --> 00:51:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So all of what
political activists

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:55.210 align:middle line:84%
have been saying for
years about, excuse me,

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.540 align:middle line:84%
it really does make a difference
for people to stand up.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the point of democracy.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.465 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're also coming very
close to the word "revolution"

00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:06.340 align:middle line:90%
of sorts, aren't you?

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is a revolution,
quite literally.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a revolution
with swords and guns,

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.990 align:middle line:84%
or a revolution
of another kind--

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.060 align:middle line:84%
astrology, of course,
the kind I practice,

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.990 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make a distinction-- but
it is literally a revolution.

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Of that we have no doubt.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Pluto square Uranus is
going to cause a revolution.

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But the two ingredients
of the revolution,

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:84%
again, it can't be stated
too many times are the power

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:84%
structure with its arm
of the media brainwashing

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:90%
people and people.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>> People waking up.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Individual human
beings waking up.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:54.280 align:middle line:84%
The nickname for the planet
Uranus is the Great Awakener.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:00.310 align:middle line:84%
This tells you why Uranus is
associated with democracy.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking
about real democracy

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:84%
is going to be for
several years upcoming

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:84%
in a pitched battle with
the rot of corrupted power.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And that could really
show itself in any way,

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that interim
period, couldn't it?

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not going to be
possible to ignore it.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:25.900 align:middle line:84%
People who try-- this is where
we get the Prozac generation

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and the TV blitzkrieg stuff.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:34.475 align:middle line:84%
I mean, numbers of TV
viewing are up and the USA.

00:53:34.475 --> 00:53:35.725 align:middle line:90%
They haven't gone down a whit.

00:53:35.725 --> 00:53:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is happening is
that this revolution is going

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:47.770 align:middle line:90%
to bring it all to a head.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And then because there's always
an X factor in astrology,

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I make no predictions, what
we will see is the tension.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.710 align:middle line:84%
The stakes are going to be
raised higher and higher

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and higher until the idea of
more and more masses of people

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.410 align:middle line:90%
having a voice--

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:08.560 align:middle line:84%
just like we talked about in
our grade school textbooks,

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.240 align:middle line:84%
coming together and raising
against this power structure--

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.940 align:middle line:90%
is going to be inevitable.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not
going to be pretty.

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's essential.

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's natural law.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, part of the cleansing.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>> That part is something
that we do know.

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's guaranteed.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we have
looked at the on-ramp.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We kind of get an idea of what's
out there for us, as you just

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:45.130 align:middle line:84%
spoke about in terms
of the restructuring

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:50.810 align:middle line:84%
after the perhaps busting
apart at the seams of a--

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.220 align:middle line:84%
not just a form of government,
or the functionality

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of the government, but
even a way of life.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We have only a few
minutes left, can you

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.390 align:middle line:84%
address that for people who
are watching who on one hand,

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain amount of
fear going on because change is

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:08.890 align:middle line:84%
coming, but on another level are
actually excited at potentials

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and how we can recreate
ourselves in hopefully

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.510 align:middle line:90%
a more evolved fashion?

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There really
isn't any question.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.320 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in
natural law, it

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.400 align:middle line:84%
has to be a more
evolved fashion.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Remember the spiral?

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And so people
waking up en masse,

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.340 align:middle line:84%
which is Uranus at its highest,
is going to create a new type

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.960 align:middle line:90%
of leadership.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the Age of
Aquarius stuff, which

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.430 align:middle line:84%
if it hadn't gotten
to be such a cliche,

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:84%
people would really look at
what that was talking about

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and see that individuals
take back the power.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> This is good.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:46.012 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what was foreseen
by those genius men who wrote

00:55:46.012 --> 00:55:49.375 align:middle line:84%
the Founding Father documents
that we are supposed to revere.

00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.720 align:middle line:84%
What I see happening
is that, first of all,

00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:00.280 align:middle line:84%
it'll start in the pocketbook
because of the strangely

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.770 align:middle line:84%
merged, we might say
enmeshed, relationship

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:06.010 align:middle line:84%
between the American
mind and the dollar.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're all
shocked and appalled

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that these economic
institutions that

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.160 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to be
on our side turned out

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to be fleecing us
left and right.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And all the protections
that were supposed

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to be put in place after
the Great Depression

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.860 align:middle line:90%
were all taken away.

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Clinton was one of the
worst offenders in this.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the deregulation,
that has gone nuts.

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.170 align:middle line:90%
We're finally seeing this.

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Now it's in the headlines.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And when the material
aspect is taken to its most,

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:44.680 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, esoteric level,
we see that the material world,

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.220 align:middle line:84%
not the dollar anymore, but
the actual physical planet,

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.520 align:middle line:84%
the physicality
of planet Earth is

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.170 align:middle line:84%
going to be seen as the
resource, the ultimate resource

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:90%
to conserve.

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:05.230 align:middle line:84%
That's really the key secret
behind American materialism--

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.200 align:middle line:84%
a respect for the
physical planet

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.040 align:middle line:84%
as a being that's limited
and has to be caretaken.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So we take care of the
planet and we start waking up en

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.710 align:middle line:90%
masse.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And with just a minute or
so left, can you give us

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.650 align:middle line:84%
a vision of what our
futures can look like, say,

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.273 align:middle line:84%
take it out 20, 30 years
even, 10, 20, 30 years.

00:57:25.273 --> 00:57:26.190 align:middle line:90%
What can it look like.

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In 30 years, there will not
be government as we know it.

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The idea of nationalism, which
has already broken down--

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the idea of Halliburton moving
to Dubai is a perfect example.

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the richest
Americans not even pretending

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:42.340 align:middle line:84%
anymore to pump their money
back in their country.

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.480 align:middle line:84%
They have tax shelters
in the Cayman Islands.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.370 align:middle line:90%
We already see it.

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.530 align:middle line:84%
National boundaries are
going to break down.

00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The idea of nationalism,
I see, is breaking down.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And what does that leave us?

00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.450 align:middle line:84%
It leaves us with a
new idea of people

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:05.220 align:middle line:84%
on a planet that don't
have these false boundaries

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:06.210 align:middle line:90%
between them anymore.

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:09.300 align:middle line:84%
No pitting one side
against the other,

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:12.840 align:middle line:84%
as is being done by the
Plutonian negative powers

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.360 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But people becoming
aware of their own power

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:19.320 align:middle line:84%
as individuals,
that's the blending

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.023 align:middle line:90%
of Uranus in full power.

00:58:23.023 --> 00:58:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Any final thoughts?

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:28.250 align:middle line:90%
We have about a minute left.

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to say that it
liberates us to know there is

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.570 align:middle line:90%
no guarantees.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It forces us into
a consciousness

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:36.750 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have before.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:39.780 align:middle line:84%
If we don't look to the
stars or to astrologers

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to predict anything, it
forces us to become aware

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:45.420 align:middle line:90%
of the potentials.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
empowering thing of all.

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:52.640 align:middle line:90%
