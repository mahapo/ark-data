00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.037
<v ->This is a must see interview, as Dr. David James</v>

2
00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.740
talks about the hidden factors behind our species'

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.416
deteriorating health, the pandemic of Lyme disease,

4
00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.179
and a new technology that is said to detect any disease

5
00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.756
in the body, and fix it at a quantum information level.

6
00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:18.604
This technology has been quoted to be

7
00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:20.900
100 years ahead of its time.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.201
You won't want to miss this one,

9
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.437
but you better have a pencil and paper handy.

10
00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:35.325
<v Voiceover>It sounds like humanity</v>

11
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.159
is up against a great deal right now

12
00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.597
just by way of toxins and dysfunctions

13
00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:40.654
in the immune system.

14
00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:43.620
And I think one of the things that must exemplify that

15
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.781
is the sharp increase in Lyme disease

16
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.216
which I think is, after talking to you off camera here,

17
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.165
is a very misunderstood.

18
00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:51.979
<v ->Mm-hmm.
<v Voiceove>Can you talk</v>

19
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.400
about what we're really up against,

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.315
what is Lyme disease,

21
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.224
what is happening to our immune systems?

22
00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:56.895
<v ->Okay.</v>

23
00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:00.595
Well the Lyme disease is almost a pandemic now.

24
00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.502
More and more doctors are getting into it

25
00:01:02.502 --> 00:01:05.266
trying to find the cause of this Lyme disease.

26
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.825
And the causes are, actually,

27
00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:10.791
the distant cousins of all of the

28
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:14.742
Stratacocsus, Streptococcus, Coxsackie B,

29
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:18.568
CMV, Cytomegalovirus, whatever

30
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:23.286
which is found in our floor, in our intestines.

31
00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:26.822
And normally helping us to digest the food

32
00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:28.712
and get the best out of it.

33
00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:30.214
But these distant cousins

34
00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:33.486
have lived up in the rarefied atmosphere,

35
00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:35.640
high up in the heavens

36
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.285
since time began.

37
00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:38.626
And they are distant cousins

38
00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:41.206
and they can live in those conditions.

39
00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:43.502
But now we have these chem trails,

40
00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:46.671
chemical trails, which are (mumbling) of barium,

41
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.942
and that's radioactive.

42
00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.197
It interacts with those things,

43
00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:53.762
causes clouds,

44
00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:56.159
clouds spread across the sky.

45
00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.554
And they're supposed to reflect the sun rays

46
00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:03.088
so that it keeps the world cool.

47
00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.078
And every countries doing this.

48
00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:06.704
So it's all around the world.

49
00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:10.442
And when it rains it brings down these distant cousins

50
00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:14.695
of all these things, and we breathe them in.

51
00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:17.208
And when we breathe them in

52
00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:21.318
those things don't know how to behave in our body.

53
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:23.770
And they don't say in our gut,

54
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.066
or our intestines.

55
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.260
They don't stay in our stomach.

56
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.952
<v Voiceover>Where do they go?</v>

57
00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:30.901
How do they, how does it impact our health

58
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.857
and show itself.

59
00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:33.644
<v ->They go everywhere.</v>

60
00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:34.844
They're in your eyes.

61
00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:35.960
In your brain.

62
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.159
In your toes.

63
00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.109
In your knees.

64
00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.593
In your hips.

65
00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:42.624
In your blood.

66
00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:43.396
Everywhere.

67
00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.265
<v Voiceover>So--</v>
<v ->And the immune</v>

68
00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.866
system doesn't do anything about it

69
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.446
because it knows that these are

70
00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:52.884
cousins of what it's got in there

71
00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:55.655
and they're used to it.

72
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.822
<v Voiceover>So it doesn't really recognize them</v>

73
00:02:57.822 --> 00:02:59.751
enough to know what to do, or it does?

74
00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:02.271
You're saying it does, it feels familiar enough to them

75
00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:03.652
that they don't attack it?

76
00:03:03.652 --> 00:03:04.811
<v ->They don't attack it.</v>

77
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.009
<v Voiceover>Oh, I see.</v>

78
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.655
So it shows up as what?

79
00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:10.418
Inflammation, pain, disease?

80
00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:13.161
<v ->Pain outside health</v>

81
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:16.255
and outside of balance.

82
00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:19.486
People feel

83
00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:23.041
got no energy.

84
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.504
Pains.

85
00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.340
They're not as they should feel.

86
00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:32.116
And they're usually on top of their page

87
00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:35.043
and they're not feeling like that anymore.

88
00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:37.683
And this is because they've got all these

89
00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:40.467
different things in there, in their body.

90
00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.478
Everywhere.

91
00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:45.424
My wife added this and it took me about

92
00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:49.920
seven months to find how to kill what she had.

93
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:54.817
And once I got that, she's a new woman. (laughs)

94
00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:56.395
<v Voiceover>That's wonderful.</v>

95
00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:58.509
Well so how does the medical industry,

96
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.353
the traditional medical field,

97
00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:03.547
handle what is called Lyme disease

98
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:05.863
and all its array of symptoms right now?

99
00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.667
<v ->Well they haven't got anything for it.</v>

100
00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.010
There's one called,

101
00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:13.624
well I'm not gonna tell you

102
00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:15.656
because everybody will be scared,

103
00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:20.133
but there's one, there's so

104
00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:25.090
fear from it, and that they won't tell anyone.

105
00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:27.319
Because they haven't got any drugs

106
00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.579
which will help you.

107
00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:33.088
And if the people knew about that

108
00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:34.632
there would be a panic.

109
00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:35.831
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

110
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:37.761
And a lot of people are already being affected by it?

111
00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:40.464
<v ->Yes, and they go to the doctors</v>

112
00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:44.892
and only the ones who are

113
00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:49.572
really trying to do something know about this condition.

114
00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:51.129
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

115
00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.369
So they don't even know, for the most part,

116
00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:53.771
your doctor won't know anything.

117
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.664
<v ->No, no.
<v Voiceover>If you're going</v>

118
00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:55.355
to a medical doctor.

119
00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:58.057
Well we'll let that remain unnamed right now

120
00:04:58.057 --> 00:05:01.044
because there's no point in panicking anybody on that one.

121
00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:02.731
<v ->We don't want to panic. (laughs)</v>

122
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Voiceover>No, we don't want to panic anybody.</v>

123
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.322
So we're looking at other loads of toxins

124
00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:08.866
in the body, as well.

125
00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:10.411
And one of them that you're particularly

126
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:14.027
concerned about is what has become known as E-smog.

127
00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:14.941
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Can you explain</v>

128
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:17.461
what E-smog is, and the various constituents of it

129
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.147
and what they're doing to us.

130
00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:21.930
<v ->Well E-smog is everything electrical</v>

131
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.835
that you've got: your phone,

132
00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:28.337
your computer, TV.

133
00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:33.598
Everything in your home is all done from electric.

134
00:05:34.628 --> 00:05:39.124
And this has a

135
00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:44.977
bad condition for us, and the world.

136
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.481
You'll know that the bees have gone,

137
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.572
the honey bees have disappeared.

138
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:54.646
Why?

139
00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:59.563
Because the E-smog, or Electrical smog

140
00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:03.072
is so thick today

141
00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:06.898
that it's more than the lay lines

142
00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:08.807
from the.

143
00:06:09.472 --> 00:06:10.427
<v Voiceover>From the earth itself.</v>

144
00:06:10.427 --> 00:06:11.545
<v ->The earth itself.</v>

145
00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:13.373
And they fly out

146
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.628
and they find the flowers

147
00:06:15.628 --> 00:06:17.883
and then they can't find their way back

148
00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:21.763
because the E-smog is stronger than the lay lines.

149
00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:23.125
<v Voiceover>This is a really big problem,</v>

150
00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:24.670
it's diverting the subject of

151
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.879
the fact that the honey bees are starting to disappear.

152
00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.789
This is a big problem for this planet.

153
00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.369
<v ->Yes, because Einsten said that</v>

154
00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:35.904
four years after the bees have gone, we're gone.

155
00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:36.717
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

156
00:06:36.717 --> 00:06:38.423
They pollinate our food supplies.

157
00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:39.338
<v ->And without.
<v Voiceover>And everything</v>

158
00:06:39.338 --> 00:06:40.171
else.
<v ->Yes.</v>

159
00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:42.182
In China now,

160
00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:45.026
because the bees have gone,

161
00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:48.236
they've got people climbing up on ladders

162
00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:52.764
with little feather

163
00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:54.272
brushes

164
00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:58.076
and they're brushing the each blossom,

165
00:06:58.679 --> 00:06:59.777
and then the other one,

166
00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:02.032
so they're doing what the bees did.

167
00:07:02.032 --> 00:07:04.571
So that they can get pears, you see,

168
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:05.973
because they grow a lot of pears

169
00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:09.150
in

170
00:07:09.468 --> 00:07:13.517
one place in China, up in the mountains.

171
00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:18.008
<v Voiceover>So we're really kind of screwing ourselves</v>

172
00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:21.684
every which way, let's not be dainty about it.

173
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:24.340
<v ->But the E-smog is so thick</v>

174
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.734
that it's causing an acid situation in our body.

175
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:32.853
And we don't have to be stressed anymore.

176
00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:36.902
We can be mild and calm, and everything like that.

177
00:07:37.058 --> 00:07:40.574
But with all this E-smog, which we've got,

178
00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:44.540
our blood and our body is in a really

179
00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:46.858
acid situation.

180
00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:48.437
<v Voiceover>Well, that's bad because</v>

181
00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:50.346
that's where cancer and everything else thrives,

182
00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.890
is in an acidic environment, right?

183
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.815
<v ->When you have acid conditions in your body,</v>

184
00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:57.619
in your blood, your blood isn't going anywhere.

185
00:07:57.619 --> 00:08:00.829
And so there's no oxygen going to the cells.

186
00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:03.673
And if the cells don't get oxygen

187
00:08:03.673 --> 00:08:06.233
they say, Well this bloke must have been

188
00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:08.326
well he must be dead.

189
00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:13.128
So it starts taking the body apart.

190
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:17.286
<v Voiceover>So we have the E-smog,</v>

191
00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:19.439
or the electromagnetic fields,

192
00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.354
that are surrounding us.

193
00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:21.857
And they're surrounding us, even if you say,

194
00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:23.321
Okay, I'm not going to use a cell phone,

195
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:26.469
I'm going to get rid of my microwave, and so forth,

196
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:28.867
it doesn't really change, considerably.

197
00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:30.126
I mean, the cell phone's a separate issue,

198
00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:31.569
we'll talk about that in a minute,

199
00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:33.397
but it doesn't really change, considerably,

200
00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:35.185
if you're living in the city, for example, does it?

201
00:08:35.185 --> 00:08:39.452
<v ->No, because the near field, Dr. Carlo will tell you.</v>

202
00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.097
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->The near field</v>

203
00:08:41.097 --> 00:08:43.495
and the far field, are just the same.

204
00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:45.466
<v Voiceover>And Dr. Carlo is the one who</v>

205
00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:48.229
basically came out, he was hired by the industry,

206
00:08:48.229 --> 00:08:52.150
cell phone industry, to create findings

207
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.380
that say cell phone use is okay for the health,

208
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.579
and he came out and said,

209
00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:57.920
"I did not say that."

210
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.566
And Nick Baggage talks about this quite a bit.

211
00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:00.540
<v ->Okay.
<v Voiceover>He did</v>

212
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.353
not say that.

213
00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:04.381
he said, "This is very detrimental to the human health."

214
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:06.433
And before anyone gets scared here

215
00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:08.749
we're going to start talking about solutions in a moment,

216
00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:11.248
but we need to express what we're up against.

217
00:09:11.248 --> 00:09:12.101
<v ->Uh huh.
<v Voiceover>In addition</v>

218
00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:14.661
to that were talking about fluoride, aspartame,

219
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:18.704
and a lot of other unhealthful elements that we ingest.

220
00:09:18.704 --> 00:09:19.639
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Can you talk</v>

221
00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:21.345
about some of those common culprits

222
00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:22.788
and what it's doing to add to the--

223
00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:24.454
<v ->Well fluoride is just everywhere,</v>

224
00:09:24.454 --> 00:09:27.319
but it's not fluoride as an atom.

225
00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:30.854
That doesn't occur in natural, in nature.

226
00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:35.321
What they've got is a fluoride which comes from a.

227
00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:40.674
<v Voiceover>A refining process?</v>

228
00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:43.992
<v ->No, it's a.
<v Voiceover>Reference?</v>

229
00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:45.212
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

230
00:09:45.212 --> 00:09:48.845
Of the,

231
00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:53.101
about four different industries.

232
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.742
And they can't put it in the sea

233
00:09:55.742 --> 00:09:57.001
because it kills the fish.

234
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:58.139
And they can't put it in the land

235
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.726
because it kills the plants.

236
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.869
So they say, All right, well we'll put it in people.

237
00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.488
And they spray it on tea,

238
00:10:05.488 --> 00:10:08.028
and in 3000 foods.

239
00:10:08.028 --> 00:10:10.750
And in the water.

240
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.376
And you can't get away from it.

241
00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:15.525
And what the fluorides that they do

242
00:10:15.525 --> 00:10:18.532
which is this rubbish,

243
00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:20.828
which is clearing out,

244
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:24.892
they, that

245
00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:29.327
changes the shape of the enzymes in our body.

246
00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:31.657
And everything works with enzymes.

247
00:10:31.657 --> 00:10:33.811
We don't work, our cells don't work.

248
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.538
They're doing their own thing.

249
00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:37.610
It's the enzymes all around.

250
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.495
We've got thousands of enzymes in our body.

251
00:10:40.495 --> 00:10:43.522
And without them we die, straight away.

252
00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:45.839
So we need those because they

253
00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.423
make things work.

254
00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:51.223
And when you have that fluoride

255
00:10:51.223 --> 00:10:53.457
in your toothpaste, in your foods,

256
00:10:53.457 --> 00:10:56.078
and all that sort of thing,

257
00:10:56.078 --> 00:11:00.554
the fluoride changes the shape of the enzymes.

258
00:11:00.934 --> 00:11:05.099
So the body and the immune system goes along and says,

259
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:09.047
Oh, hello Mr. X, Y, Z, enyzme.

260
00:11:09.325 --> 00:11:11.702
Hello, Mr., who?

261
00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:13.023
You're not that one.

262
00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:14.607
And it attacks it, you see.

263
00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.578
And that might be the enzyme

264
00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:18.407
that was good for your knees.

265
00:11:18.407 --> 00:11:20.276
<v Voiceover>So it's because it's almost an autoimmune</v>

266
00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:22.226
problem then?
<v ->Immune system, yes.</v>

267
00:11:22.226 --> 00:11:23.709
And they say the immune system

268
00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:25.782
is attacking the body.

269
00:11:25.782 --> 00:11:26.635
It's not.

270
00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:28.301
It's attacking the enzymes

271
00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:30.780
which have had the state changed

272
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.319
or the shape changed.

273
00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:36.022
<v Voiceover>And just to take this back</v>

274
00:11:36.022 --> 00:11:39.800
from a moment ago, about alkalinity as well.

275
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.828
Not only, a lot of people have

276
00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:46.491
started investing in technologies.

277
00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:48.171
Kangen and some other companies

278
00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:52.377
that create a more acid-- a more alkaline based water.

279
00:11:52.377 --> 00:11:53.352
<v ->Mm-hmm.
<v Voiceover>But you're</v>

280
00:11:53.352 --> 00:11:55.506
saying, with taking all of this into consideration,

281
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.684
what you talked about before,

282
00:11:56.684 --> 00:11:58.939
the electromagnetic frequencies,

283
00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:00.625
and being in that sea of E-smog,

284
00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:03.023
you're saying that it doesn't make a difference then?

285
00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:04.262
<v ->No.</v>

286
00:12:04.262 --> 00:12:06.253
<v Voiceover>To drink that alkaline water?</v>

287
00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:09.646
<v ->Well it's not, the water is alkaline</v>

288
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.515
and it's been forced to be alkaline

289
00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:16.515
by electrical, or mechanical,

290
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.537
or chemical means.

291
00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:21.247
And that doesn't make any sense to our cells.

292
00:12:21.247 --> 00:12:23.746
When that water gets to our cells

293
00:12:23.746 --> 00:12:27.856
the material is one thing, but the information,

294
00:12:28.094 --> 00:12:30.945
which is holding the matter together,

295
00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:34.169
and it doesn't make any sense to our cells.

296
00:12:34.169 --> 00:12:38.435
And our cells says, Well I don't know what that is,

297
00:12:38.435 --> 00:12:40.040
but it's no use to me.

298
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.923
And so it sends metabolic enzymes out

299
00:12:45.628 --> 00:12:48.106
to shoo it away.

300
00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:50.077
And when you do that

301
00:12:50.077 --> 00:12:54.309
as a Nobel prize winner showed,

302
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.883
when you use your metabolic enzymes

303
00:12:56.883 --> 00:13:00.479
to do that sort of work, you shorten your life.

304
00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:03.567
<v Voiceover>Now metabolic dysfunction</v>

305
00:13:03.567 --> 00:13:07.062
and imbalances are really rife right now,

306
00:13:07.062 --> 00:13:08.586
as well, aren't they?
<v ->Yes.</v>

307
00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:10.028
<v Voiceover>Aren't a lot of people out of balance</v>

308
00:13:10.028 --> 00:13:12.730
metabolically?
<v ->Yes, hugely.</v>

309
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.592
Most of the people are eating acid food.

310
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:21.223
Well it's the ash you're gonna look at.

311
00:13:21.223 --> 00:13:23.458
After it goes through the gut,

312
00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:27.257
or the stomach, it comes out to a gland

313
00:13:27.257 --> 00:13:30.000
which has departed through,

314
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.557
either to the intestines or the kidneys.

315
00:13:34.937 --> 00:13:38.960
And if it's going to those, which are very

316
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.960
fragile tissues, it has to be either alkaline, or neutral.

317
00:13:44.913 --> 00:13:48.468
So we have to look at the ash after it's left the

318
00:13:48.468 --> 00:13:52.802
stomach, and through that hydrochloric acid.

319
00:13:53.608 --> 00:13:57.611
And if it's still acid ash,

320
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:01.613
then the body rips out sodium, and calcium,

321
00:14:01.613 --> 00:14:05.067
and all these big atoms,

322
00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:08.974
and injects this in the food.

323
00:14:09.374 --> 00:14:12.280
And the ash to bring it up to neutralize,

324
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.541
or to alkalize.

325
00:14:14.738 --> 00:14:17.399
And so it can be safely handled by

326
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.555
the fragile tissues.

327
00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:25.486
And so by very, by the worth

328
00:14:25.486 --> 00:14:27.375
of the food they're eating,

329
00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:30.402
people are getting old and bent over,

330
00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:33.511
and they're breaking bones and osteo, and all that.

331
00:14:33.511 --> 00:14:34.588
<v Voiceover>At a young age.</v>
<v ->At a yeah.</v>

332
00:14:34.588 --> 00:14:36.071
<v Voiceover>And a lot of children</v>

333
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:37.371
have a lot of obesity.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

334
00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:38.732
<v Voiceover>And the old immune--</v>

335
00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:39.972
<v ->Well that's
<v Voiceover>system problems</v>

336
00:14:39.972 --> 00:14:41.922
didn't exist.
<v ->Most babies were in the west</v>

337
00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:46.789
were born with 95 and more toxic

338
00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:50.597
chemicals in their circulation.

339
00:14:50.597 --> 00:14:51.959
I wouldn't call it blood system,

340
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:52.995
because it's not.

341
00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:55.534
It is a bit of blood in there.

342
00:14:55.534 --> 00:14:56.571
<v Voiceover>With all the toxins.</v>

343
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:57.607
<v ->With all the toxins.
(laughs)

344
00:14:57.607 --> 00:14:58.602
<v Voiceover>Oh God, that's sad.</v>

345
00:14:58.602 --> 00:15:02.402
<v ->And so the liver has to handle this.</v>

346
00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.469
And so the liver takes whatever

347
00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:08.904
fats there are in the food,

348
00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:11.159
and it wraps up these toxins

349
00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:13.272
and places them in an area where

350
00:15:13.272 --> 00:15:16.198
there's no harm gonna happen.

351
00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:18.371
There's not much circulation, in fact,

352
00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:20.179
nothing much happens there.

353
00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:23.491
So all these sites on the back of the arms

354
00:15:23.491 --> 00:15:25.239
and the back of the legs, and the hips.

355
00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:26.802
<v Voiceover>All these what?</v>

356
00:15:26.802 --> 00:15:28.489
<v ->All these sites.
<v Voiceover>Sites?</v>

357
00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:30.317
<v ->On the body.
<v Voiceover>Spots you mean?</v>

358
00:15:30.317 --> 00:15:31.028
<v ->No no no no.</v>

359
00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:32.633
<v Voiceover>Oh sites, oh, I see what you're saying.</v>

360
00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:33.406
Sites.
<v ->All these areas.</v>

361
00:15:33.406 --> 00:15:34.706
<v Voiceover>All these areas of the body, right.</v>

362
00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:35.471
<v ->Yeah.</v>

363
00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:38.891
Which don't see much activity

364
00:15:38.891 --> 00:15:41.695
is where they are deposited.

365
00:15:41.695 --> 00:15:46.368
And if you do any diets, and starving yourself,

366
00:15:46.368 --> 00:15:50.153
all you do is burn up the fats.

367
00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:53.275
But the toxins are left in your body again.

368
00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:55.978
<v Voiceover>Well, and one of the most, I think,</v>

369
00:15:55.978 --> 00:15:59.391
popular things in the progressive movement,

370
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:00.508
is detoxing.

371
00:16:00.508 --> 00:16:03.779
Detoxing clinics that are opening up everywhere.

372
00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:05.648
People are flying out of country to detox.

373
00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:06.522
<v ->Yes.</v>

374
00:16:06.522 --> 00:16:08.716
<v Voiceover>And what about those traditional</v>

375
00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:12.008
means of detoxing, using whether it's barley greens

376
00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:16.213
or using sana and other ingredients

377
00:16:16.213 --> 00:16:18.042
to detox the intestines and all.

378
00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:19.383
What is this doing?

379
00:16:19.383 --> 00:16:22.979
<v ->Well, it's using traditional things</v>

380
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:26.886
to do a modern job.

381
00:16:27.064 --> 00:16:28.713
And they can't do it.

382
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.786
<v Voiceover>What do you mean they can't do it?</v>

383
00:16:29.786 --> 00:16:33.584
<v ->Because we've got toxins in our switch metals and things,</v>

384
00:16:33.584 --> 00:16:36.592
which we didn't have in those early days.

385
00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.298
And sort of the traditional types

386
00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:42.281
of therapies

387
00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:43.662
are not working.

388
00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:46.344
What we need to do is to have something

389
00:16:46.344 --> 00:16:49.128
which is full of energy.

390
00:16:49.128 --> 00:16:51.829
And for detoxing, the only thing,

391
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:55.609
and this is supported by Dr. Klinghardt

392
00:16:55.609 --> 00:17:00.336
of University of Washington,

393
00:17:01.547 --> 00:17:02.861
is satellite.

394
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.198
Any way, somewhere out there.

395
00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:08.773
He's tested these bamboo,

396
00:17:08.773 --> 00:17:12.640
moso bamboo patches from Japan.

397
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:15.234
And he said that the only thing,

398
00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:16.656
and the quickest way,

399
00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:20.720
to get everything out of the body in one go, safely.

400
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.528
<v Voiceover>Including every kind of toxin,</v>

401
00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:23.625
heavy metals, all of that?

402
00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:28.014
<v ->Well he's found, and he's the authority on this,</v>

403
00:17:28.014 --> 00:17:31.020
that once mercury is out,

404
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.845
every other heavy metal leaves of its own accord.

405
00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:34.637
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

406
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.750
<v Voiceover>And we all have these mercury</v>

407
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.010
fillings in our mouths.

408
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.310
<v ->Yes, and metal, yes.</v>

409
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.204
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

410
00:17:40.204 --> 00:17:41.159
Well.
<v ->And that's having</v>

411
00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:43.576
a broken thermometer

412
00:17:43.576 --> 00:17:44.938
dripping down your throat

413
00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:47.504
24/7.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

414
00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:49.143
And a lot of people watching this,

415
00:17:49.143 --> 00:17:50.423
a lot of us have that,

416
00:17:50.423 --> 00:17:51.703
mercury in our mouths still.

417
00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.105
I even have some left in my mouth.

418
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:56.557
<v ->If you go to Dr. Klinghardt for detoxing,</v>

419
00:17:57.317 --> 00:18:00.175
the first thing he says, if he's gonna see you,

420
00:18:00.175 --> 00:18:01.923
is, "Go and have those out."

421
00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:02.695
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->And he</v>

422
00:18:02.695 --> 00:18:04.158
won't see you while you've got them in.

423
00:18:04.158 --> 00:18:04.869
<v Voiceover>It makes sense</v>

424
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:06.677
because you can't do your job, can you?

425
00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:08.038
<v ->That's right.
<v Voiceover>Okay, I'm</v>

426
00:18:08.038 --> 00:18:10.232
writing that down, that's number one on the list,

427
00:18:10.232 --> 00:18:13.260
we've been putting it off, but we must do this.

428
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.297
No fooling around.
<v ->When you</v>

429
00:18:14.297 --> 00:18:17.445
go to a dentist, make sure he has a vacuum

430
00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:21.616
system to fit around every tooth.

431
00:18:22.402 --> 00:18:25.125
And this is a very forced vacuum.

432
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.892
And when he's doing any drilling,

433
00:18:26.892 --> 00:18:29.960
or clearing out all of it,

434
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.764
all of the dust goes straight into the vacuum system

435
00:18:32.764 --> 00:18:33.739
and out.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

436
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:35.832
<v ->He doesn't breathe it, you don't breathe it.</v>

437
00:18:35.832 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And doctors,</v>

438
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.886
dentists are the highest--

439
00:18:41.886 --> 00:18:43.146
<v Voiceover>Suicide rate.</v>
<v ->Suicide rate</v>

440
00:18:43.146 --> 00:18:44.202
<v Voiceover>Yeah you can understand that.</v>

441
00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:45.929
<v ->Because of all the mercury they're handling.</v>

442
00:18:45.929 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Voiceover>That makes sense.</v>

443
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.002
<v ->It goes straight to their brains, you see.</v>

444
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.283
And once it's in their brain,

445
00:18:49.283 --> 00:18:51.110
it burns all the bridges,

446
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.182
so that mercury's in there

447
00:18:53.182 --> 00:18:54.483
and they can't get out.

448
00:18:54.483 --> 00:18:57.307
<v Voiceover>So we.</v>
<v ->The only way is,</v>

449
00:18:57.307 --> 00:18:59.928
and there is a new way,

450
00:18:59.928 --> 00:19:01.939
and the Japanese have been working on this.

451
00:19:01.939 --> 00:19:03.362
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that technology now,</v>

452
00:19:03.362 --> 00:19:04.438
and can you say the name of it,

453
00:19:04.438 --> 00:19:05.677
because people are going to want to go

454
00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:07.283
do a search probably as soon as the

455
00:19:07.283 --> 00:19:08.197
interview is over.

456
00:19:08.197 --> 00:19:10.147
<v ->Mr. Makanura.
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>

457
00:19:10.147 --> 00:19:11.447
uh huh, that technology.

458
00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:12.870
So you mentioned bamboo,

459
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.029
bits of bamboo.
<v ->Yes.</v>

460
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.206
<v Voiceover>Technology out of Japan.</v>

461
00:19:15.206 --> 00:19:17.675
<v ->Moso bamboo.
<v Voiceover>Moos,</v>

462
00:19:17.675 --> 00:19:19.208
M-U-S-U?

463
00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:22.093
<v ->M-O-S-O.
<v Voiceover>M-O-S-O.</v>

464
00:19:22.093 --> 00:19:23.394
Okay.
<v ->Moso.</v>

465
00:19:23.394 --> 00:19:24.613
<v Voiceover>Moso Bamboo.</v>
<v ->Bamboo.</v>

466
00:19:24.613 --> 00:19:28.250
And it grows to over 50

467
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.936
meters, high.

468
00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:32.191
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->And it's very</v>

469
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:36.384
vigorous, so a lot of energy on it.

470
00:19:36.762 --> 00:19:38.977
And what Mr. Nakamura does

471
00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.801
is they harvest this stuff.

472
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:43.986
Systematic.

473
00:19:45.356 --> 00:19:47.591
They produce the vinagar.

474
00:19:47.591 --> 00:19:48.974
He then dewaters that

475
00:19:48.974 --> 00:19:50.538
and makes powder.

476
00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:51.920
He keeps that powder

477
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.928
for at least 15 years, stored.

478
00:19:56.653 --> 00:20:00.722
And this picks up energy from stars,

479
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.674
and from the sun.

480
00:20:02.727 --> 00:20:04.862
And this is why they're packed full

481
00:20:04.862 --> 00:20:08.422
of elementary energy.

482
00:20:08.803 --> 00:20:10.104
And when you put them on,

483
00:20:10.104 --> 00:20:11.159
goodness gracious.

484
00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:12.013
<v Voiceover>What happens?</v>

485
00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:12.826
When you say put them on, what are they,

486
00:20:12.826 --> 00:20:14.085
where do you put them, and what happens?

487
00:20:14.085 --> 00:20:16.198
<v ->They're patches.</v>

488
00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:19.144
They're self sticky.

489
00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:20.322
<v Voiceover>Self-adhesive.</v>

490
00:20:20.322 --> 00:20:22.333
<v ->Yeah, and you put them on,</v>

491
00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:25.320
either your heel to do the pelvis area,

492
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.119
your arch to do your inter gut area,

493
00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:33.471
and the ball of your foot to do your chest area.

494
00:20:33.471 --> 00:20:38.038
And you do this one night, one night, and one night,

495
00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:41.696
next forth and you do that for two weeks.

496
00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:43.849
And it's dependent on the condition of

497
00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:48.041
do you carry on, or do you stop it and then just do a.

498
00:20:48.624 --> 00:20:49.700
<v Voiceover>How will you know whether</v>

499
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.330
you are to carry on?

500
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.443
<v ->By the condition of them.</v>

501
00:20:52.443 --> 00:20:53.764
Of the most people who have never done

502
00:20:53.764 --> 00:20:55.004
a detox in their life,

503
00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:57.583
and when they start this all tree col

504
00:20:57.583 --> 00:21:00.347
and black goo comes out of them.

505
00:21:00.347 --> 00:21:01.343
<v Voiceover>Out of the bottom of their feet?</v>

506
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.013
<v ->Yep.</v>

507
00:21:02.013 --> 00:21:04.532
So when you take them off go outside,

508
00:21:04.532 --> 00:21:07.234
and even in the snow,

509
00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:09.829
and take them off and fling them

510
00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:13.201
out somewhere where you're not going to breathe them.

511
00:21:13.201 --> 00:21:15.456
Because they're pulling out mercury,

512
00:21:15.456 --> 00:21:19.093
and that's methery, mercury is a gas.

513
00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:21.633
And that, you'll breathe it in

514
00:21:21.633 --> 00:21:24.152
and you'll just circulate around and around.

515
00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:25.250
<v Voiceover>When you go pick them up after</v>

516
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.184
you've tossed them out?

517
00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.098
<v ->A couple of hours</v>

518
00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:29.475
when they've released all that mercury.

519
00:21:29.475 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->And then you</v>

520
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.279
can show your neighbors and say,

521
00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.762
"Look what came out of me."

522
00:21:33.762 --> 00:21:34.818
<v Voiceover>Well no thank you. (laughs)</v>

523
00:21:34.818 --> 00:21:37.298
I don't think I'd want to show the neighbors that.

524
00:21:37.298 --> 00:21:40.406
But okay, so that gives us a place to start.

525
00:21:40.406 --> 00:21:41.378
There is technology--
<v ->Well, with all of those.</v>

526
00:21:41.378 --> 00:21:42.519
<v Voiceover>to draw that out.</v>

527
00:21:42.519 --> 00:21:44.897
<v ->Minerals and metals in our body,</v>

528
00:21:44.897 --> 00:21:49.332
there's a lot of people who are ringing

529
00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:54.064
and they're feeling very queer from all the E-smog

530
00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.827
because that is acting on your body.

531
00:21:56.827 --> 00:21:58.209
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And that's</v>

532
00:21:58.209 --> 00:22:01.419
a condition, which doctors well know.

533
00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:04.365
And so what we have to do is

534
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:08.617
get the minerals, and the metals,

535
00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:11.253
and all of those things out of the body.

536
00:22:11.253 --> 00:22:12.187
<v Voiceover>It's not just the body,</v>

537
00:22:12.187 --> 00:22:14.138
it's creating depression, and it's

538
00:22:14.138 --> 00:22:17.204
creating a lot of different kinds of mental dysfunctions,

539
00:22:17.204 --> 00:22:20.680
as well, and emotional.
<v ->Yes, ADD,</v>

540
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.427
ADHD, all of that,

541
00:22:22.427 --> 00:22:24.438
it's all caused by that sort of thing.

542
00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:25.576
<v Voiceover>This kind of build up.</v>

543
00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:26.653
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>And there are</v>

544
00:22:26.653 --> 00:22:28.258
other, I mean, we can go into so many areas.

545
00:22:28.258 --> 00:22:29.822
We could talk and do a six hour interview.

546
00:22:29.822 --> 00:22:31.042
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>But I'm going</v>

547
00:22:31.042 --> 00:22:31.915
to keep it moving

548
00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:32.971
because there are a lot of other things,

549
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:34.271
like vaccines and so forth,

550
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.735
that we could be talking about, too.

551
00:22:35.735 --> 00:22:39.188
<v ->Well, there's a professor doctor in Germany</v>

552
00:22:39.188 --> 00:22:43.109
and he is at the university.

553
00:22:43.109 --> 00:22:46.767
And he says, or he said in 2004,

554
00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:49.895
that electrosmog is so thick today

555
00:22:49.895 --> 00:22:53.470
that if it were visible, and it's not.

556
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.112
That's why we don't take any notice of it,

557
00:22:56.112 --> 00:22:58.164
but if it were visible, today,

558
00:22:58.164 --> 00:23:00.156
and this was in 2004, so we're now

559
00:23:00.156 --> 00:23:03.386
almost in 2008, so it's got a lot worse.

560
00:23:03.386 --> 00:23:04.991
If you hold your own hand

561
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:06.393
in front of your face

562
00:23:06.393 --> 00:23:07.734
you won't be able to see it.

563
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:09.440
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

564
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.802
That's amazing.

565
00:23:10.802 --> 00:23:13.158
<v ->And he's an expert in this.</v>

566
00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.536
So um.
<v Voiceover>Well, the good</v>

567
00:23:15.536 --> 00:23:17.913
news is there are things that we can do.

568
00:23:17.913 --> 00:23:18.847
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>I mean, it's not</v>

569
00:23:18.847 --> 00:23:20.127
cheap, it's all new technology,

570
00:23:20.127 --> 00:23:21.976
but this is the age of new technology.

571
00:23:21.976 --> 00:23:22.706
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>This is the</v>

572
00:23:22.706 --> 00:23:25.755
age of revelation of all knowledge.

573
00:23:25.755 --> 00:23:27.421
<v ->All knowledge.
<v Voiceover>And so,</v>

574
00:23:27.421 --> 00:23:29.208
and you've become involved with somebody

575
00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:31.952
who has created a technology

576
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.475
that actually counters that.

577
00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:33.962
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>And we're</v>

578
00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:35.964
gonna talk about that in just a bit.

579
00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:38.311
There's so much to talk about here.

580
00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:39.651
I'm sorry, go ahead.

581
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:42.151
<v ->No no, you had another point on your list.</v>

582
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:44.405
<v Voiceover>Oh, well I have many lists,</v>

583
00:23:44.405 --> 00:23:45.889
many points on this list,

584
00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:48.733
but I was going to say, now for.

585
00:23:48.733 --> 00:23:50.988
Let's give ourselves something we can all do

586
00:23:50.988 --> 00:23:54.239
right away, to at least start bringing in

587
00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:58.039
a better quality of nutrient into the body

588
00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.603
through what we eat, and so forth.

589
00:23:59.603 --> 00:24:02.915
I'm already hearing that water,

590
00:24:02.915 --> 00:24:04.234
the alkalizing water isn't going to do it,

591
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:05.800
but we do need clean, pure water.

592
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.633
As fast as we can.

593
00:24:06.633 --> 00:24:08.116
<v ->Yeah, we do need clean pure water.</v>

594
00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:09.639
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And those that</v>

595
00:24:09.639 --> 00:24:14.150
those of us that live in towns

596
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.242
can go along to a Whole Foods

597
00:24:16.242 --> 00:24:17.502
or a place like that

598
00:24:17.502 --> 00:24:21.389
to get

599
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:22.947
Auro water.

600
00:24:22.947 --> 00:24:24.146
<v Voiceover>Is that the bulk machines where you?</v>

601
00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:25.975
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>You pay 25 cents</v>

602
00:24:25.975 --> 00:24:27.240
a gallon, or something?

603
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.270
<v ->Yeah, that's it.</v>

604
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.530
And that's--
<v Voiceover>That's reverse</v>

605
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.806
osmosis, yes.
<v ->Reverse osmosis.</v>

606
00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:36.261
But it's also been through a carbon filter.

607
00:24:36.783 --> 00:24:39.302
It's also been through UV light

608
00:24:39.302 --> 00:24:43.352
to kill any micros.

609
00:24:43.996 --> 00:24:47.267
And other systems.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

610
00:24:47.267 --> 00:24:51.188
<v ->But the thing is, like your alkalizing systems,</v>

611
00:24:51.188 --> 00:24:55.316
and Auro filters in Whole Foods, or wherever.

612
00:24:55.316 --> 00:24:57.638
This is all stressed water,

613
00:24:57.638 --> 00:24:58.857
it's gone through pumps,

614
00:24:58.857 --> 00:25:00.360
it's gone through pipework,

615
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.124
it's gone through, it's had electrical fields on it,

616
00:25:03.124 --> 00:25:06.009
it's had lights shined, shone on it,

617
00:25:06.009 --> 00:25:09.855
it's forced, it's changed.

618
00:25:10.397 --> 00:25:12.043
And the information in it,

619
00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:14.785
that is now bringing to the body

620
00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:17.548
is like the other water that we talked about

621
00:25:17.548 --> 00:25:20.129
and the other food we talked earlier about,

622
00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:21.958
it doesn't make any sense to the cells.

623
00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.217
<v Voiceover>Oh.</v>
<v ->And so</v>

624
00:25:23.217 --> 00:25:25.249
the cells tell the enzymes, and say,

625
00:25:25.249 --> 00:25:26.570
I don't want this.

626
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.211
And plus the fact that most of it is clustered.

627
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:32.430
Well, what you have to do is to,

628
00:25:32.847 --> 00:25:36.511
we've got at home, we've got a vortex.

629
00:25:36.687 --> 00:25:38.576
It's a little orifice plate

630
00:25:38.576 --> 00:25:40.872
with love and thanks around it.

631
00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.396
<v Voiceover>This is like Misari Moto's work,</v>

632
00:25:42.396 --> 00:25:43.696
you charge it.
<v ->Yes.</v>

633
00:25:43.696 --> 00:25:44.752
<v Voiceover>To restructure it.</v>

634
00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:46.317
<v ->Well, you give it the information</v>

635
00:25:46.317 --> 00:25:48.186
and the information is love and thanks.

636
00:25:48.186 --> 00:25:49.039
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->The love and</v>

637
00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:52.564
thanks gives us the shape of the crystals

638
00:25:52.564 --> 00:25:54.920
in a hexagon.

639
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.596
And this hexagon reflects

640
00:25:58.596 --> 00:26:02.619
the bio photons,

641
00:26:03.449 --> 00:26:06.234
which other scientists have found.

642
00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:08.124
And when you look at these bio photons,

643
00:26:08.124 --> 00:26:11.049
which are below atoms, and electrons,

644
00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:14.895
and bat down the range.

645
00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:19.278
These, when you look at them from

646
00:26:20.258 --> 00:26:23.880
Fritzpop, Professor Fritzpop's research,

647
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.312
they are actually hexagons, as well.

648
00:26:27.312 --> 00:26:28.897
<v Voiceover>Oh, interesting.</v>

649
00:26:28.897 --> 00:26:32.330
<v ->So the water crystal remembers</v>

650
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.464
what the bio photons shape is.

651
00:26:34.464 --> 00:26:35.703
And it gives it that,

652
00:26:35.703 --> 00:26:37.166
and that makes sense to our cells.

653
00:26:37.166 --> 00:26:38.406
<v Voiceover>Yes, that does make sense.</v>

654
00:26:38.406 --> 00:26:39.319
Yes.

655
00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:41.493
Okay, so there is a fix on that.

656
00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:44.826
<v ->We spin it and make it,</v>

657
00:26:44.826 --> 00:26:45.863
and I've got a company,

658
00:26:45.863 --> 00:26:47.853
he's gonna make those over here.

659
00:26:47.853 --> 00:26:49.891
<v Voiceover>Oh good, when people check on</v>

660
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:52.180
to your site and they'll be able to see

661
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.684
all these different things that you're

662
00:26:53.684 --> 00:26:55.798
starting to become aware of, and develop,

663
00:26:55.798 --> 00:26:57.584
and be part of, even.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

664
00:26:57.584 --> 00:26:59.555
<v Voiceover>And then oils.</v>

665
00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:00.693
Yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead.

666
00:27:00.693 --> 00:27:01.771
<v ->And then what we do,</v>

667
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:04.045
in order to give the proper structure.

668
00:27:04.045 --> 00:27:08.170
Because as I was talking to other people earlier,

669
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.917
all of the surface tensions

670
00:27:09.917 --> 00:27:11.380
of these different waters

671
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.569
is variance to what is naturally occurring.

672
00:27:14.569 --> 00:27:16.835
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And lemon juice,</v>

673
00:27:18.535 --> 00:27:19.812
like the lemon juice,

674
00:27:19.812 --> 00:27:22.474
is on the scale of things

675
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:26.034
about 330 of these units.

676
00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:30.092
Tap water is about 570.

677
00:27:30.092 --> 00:27:33.119
And it presents problems for our enzymes

678
00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:35.394
to go out and bust them up.

679
00:27:35.394 --> 00:27:39.606
And lemon juice and that 330

680
00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:41.754
is what we're looking for in our water.

681
00:27:41.754 --> 00:27:42.830
<v Voiceover>So we can take some</v>

682
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.867
fresh fresh lemon juice.

683
00:27:43.867 --> 00:27:44.537
<v ->Yep.
<v Voiceover>If we can</v>

684
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:45.411
get it fresh as we can get it.

685
00:27:45.411 --> 00:27:46.387
<v ->Yep, off the tree.</v>

686
00:27:46.387 --> 00:27:47.402
<v Voiceover>Squirt-- yeah off the tree.</v>

687
00:27:47.402 --> 00:27:48.214
Squirt a little bit,

688
00:27:48.214 --> 00:27:49.352
everybody needs to buy a lemon tree,

689
00:27:49.352 --> 00:27:51.181
actually, we just bought one for that purpose.

690
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:53.152
And then squirt a little bit in each,

691
00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:54.899
just what, a teaspoon, or so, per glass?

692
00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:55.996
Not too much?
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

693
00:27:55.996 --> 00:27:57.377
Or the other way is to

694
00:27:57.377 --> 00:27:59.227
get some empowerment water

695
00:27:59.227 --> 00:28:02.111
form another company in (mumbling), Kansas.

696
00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:03.128
<v Voiceover>Empowerment water.</v>

697
00:28:03.128 --> 00:28:03.819
Okay.
<v ->Empowerment</v>

698
00:28:03.819 --> 00:28:04.773
water, yeah.
<v Voiceover>And then</v>

699
00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:06.257
we'll have that, we'll find that on your site too?

700
00:28:06.257 --> 00:28:06.886
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Okay, good.</v>

701
00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:08.613
Well we're going to, people,

702
00:28:08.613 --> 00:28:10.036
I think everybody watching is going

703
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:12.210
to be searching this pretty thoroughly.

704
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.809
Okay, now lets get onto the oils we eat.

705
00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:16.009
And we take into our bodies.

706
00:28:16.009 --> 00:28:16.841
<v ->Fats.
<v Voiceover>That's a big</v>

707
00:28:16.841 --> 00:28:17.532
one, fats, yeah.

708
00:28:17.532 --> 00:28:20.583
Fats.
<v ->The fats we need</v>

709
00:28:22.953 --> 00:28:24.989
are the essential fatty acid.

710
00:28:24.989 --> 00:28:27.650
Omega three, omega six, omega nine.

711
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.469
And like most of what the shops sell

712
00:28:31.469 --> 00:28:32.832
it's not fish oil.

713
00:28:32.832 --> 00:28:34.274
Fish don't make oil.

714
00:28:34.274 --> 00:28:35.472
They never have.

715
00:28:35.472 --> 00:28:36.346
They never will.

716
00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:37.972
<v Voiceover>So why do they say they do?</v>

717
00:28:37.972 --> 00:28:39.638
<v ->Because it's found in fish.</v>

718
00:28:39.638 --> 00:28:41.364
But fish get it from plankton

719
00:28:41.364 --> 00:28:43.070
and plankton is plants.

720
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.372
<v Voiceover>So why not go right to the plant,</v>

721
00:28:44.372 --> 00:28:45.752
the flax, etcetera, right?

722
00:28:45.752 --> 00:28:46.951
<v ->Exactly.
(laughs)

723
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:48.800
Well, it's lots of plants on earth

724
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.856
which do that.

725
00:28:49.856 --> 00:28:52.721
And parilla, and--
<v Voiceover>Hemp seeds.</v>

726
00:28:52.721 --> 00:28:54.671
Yeah.
<v ->Hemp seeds.</v>

727
00:28:54.671 --> 00:28:55.830
Flax.

728
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.999
Many different places you can get it from.

729
00:28:58.999 --> 00:29:03.435
And all of these are very effectively produced

730
00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:06.455
by Dr. Udo.

731
00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:08.304
<v Voiceover>Well yeah, you and I are both</v>

732
00:29:08.304 --> 00:29:10.681
fans of Udo's Choice, that oil blend

733
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:12.754
which it's been my favorite for many years.

734
00:29:12.754 --> 00:29:14.503
<v ->And I tell people because it's freely available</v>

735
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:15.313
in the shops.

736
00:29:15.313 --> 00:29:16.410
<v Voiceover>It's yeah, you find it everywhere.</v>

737
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.671
So that's a good one, for sure.

738
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:20.088
<v ->It's a good one and people should just go in there.</v>

739
00:29:20.088 --> 00:29:22.079
And if you've got the synapses,

740
00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:24.111
which are, and the neurons,

741
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:27.422
whcih are electro chemical in nature.

742
00:29:27.422 --> 00:29:29.271
And are direct current,

743
00:29:29.271 --> 00:29:30.450
not automating current.

744
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.543
Our body only works on direct current.

745
00:29:33.543 --> 00:29:35.309
These have a coating of,

746
00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:36.992
or should have a coating

747
00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:38.556
over these essential fatty acids

748
00:29:38.556 --> 00:29:42.544
on these to aide the

749
00:29:42.544 --> 00:29:45.090
electro chemical process.

750
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.382
But if your body isn't having those

751
00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:50.575
essential fatty acids,

752
00:29:50.575 --> 00:29:52.586
that's why they call it essential, because.

753
00:29:52.586 --> 00:29:53.643
<v Voiceover>Right, you must have it.</v>

754
00:29:53.643 --> 00:29:54.577
<v ->You must have it.</v>

755
00:29:54.577 --> 00:29:57.137
And we don't produce it in ourselves.

756
00:29:57.137 --> 00:29:59.067
So if you don't have those then the body

757
00:29:59.067 --> 00:30:01.546
will say, Then I'll take any old trans fat,

758
00:30:01.546 --> 00:30:05.142
or monounsaturated, or any polyunsaturated,

759
00:30:05.142 --> 00:30:07.419
I'll just stick anything in between there

760
00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:09.023
in order to get the process going.

761
00:30:09.023 --> 00:30:10.445
<v Voiceover>So once the synapse occurs</v>

762
00:30:10.445 --> 00:30:13.676
with the poor quality of fat on there, what happens?

763
00:30:13.676 --> 00:30:16.012
<v ->ADD, ADHD.</v>

764
00:30:16.832 --> 00:30:20.339
All these children who can't concentrate.

765
00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:21.173
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->All these</v>

766
00:30:21.173 --> 00:30:22.615
adults that can't concentrate.

767
00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:25.114
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->That's exacerbated</v>

768
00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:26.983
by the E-smog, as well.

769
00:30:26.983 --> 00:30:30.213
Because that is what we come on to.

770
00:30:30.213 --> 00:30:31.834
<v Voiceover>Yes, okay.</v>

771
00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:33.200
All right, so.

772
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.623
<v ->The heavy metals are being</v>

773
00:30:34.623 --> 00:30:38.429
acted upon the,

774
00:30:38.808 --> 00:30:41.064
E-smog, and everything's being

775
00:30:41.064 --> 00:30:42.546
acted upon by the E-smog too.

776
00:30:42.546 --> 00:30:43.358
<v Voiceover>So we're getting</v>

777
00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:45.268
really corrupted information systems

778
00:30:45.268 --> 00:30:46.467
is what's happening.

779
00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:48.458
The synapse can't give proper information

780
00:30:48.458 --> 00:30:50.449
unless it has a proper healthy essential

781
00:30:50.449 --> 00:30:51.811
fatty acid on it.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

782
00:30:51.811 --> 00:30:53.498
<v Voiceover>So we need to bump up our omega three,</v>

783
00:30:53.498 --> 00:30:54.987
nine, and six?
<v ->And the neurons, as well.</v>

784
00:30:54.987 --> 00:30:57.019
<v Voiceover>And who knows, right, right.</v>

785
00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:59.132
And in addition to that, for actual,

786
00:30:59.132 --> 00:31:01.529
for taking in fats into our bodies.

787
00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:03.663
<v ->Yeah, well what we need is saturated fats.</v>

788
00:31:03.663 --> 00:31:05.512
Never mind about what they tell you,

789
00:31:05.512 --> 00:31:07.990
healthy eating can actually kill you.

790
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.620
Early.

791
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.672
It will give you cancer,

792
00:31:10.672 --> 00:31:12.623
heart disease,

793
00:31:12.623 --> 00:31:14.228
and a short life.

794
00:31:14.228 --> 00:31:15.629
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And lots</v>

795
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:17.153
of age spots, as well.

796
00:31:17.153 --> 00:31:18.108
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
All these

797
00:31:18.108 --> 00:31:19.347
spots that people see all over,

798
00:31:19.347 --> 00:31:20.262
that's plaque.

799
00:31:20.262 --> 00:31:21.887
And it's plaque from all these plastics

800
00:31:21.887 --> 00:31:23.086
which people are eating.

801
00:31:23.086 --> 00:31:25.753
<v Voiceover>Which is these terrible oils we see on</v>

802
00:31:25.753 --> 00:31:26.499
the store shelves.
<v ->Because</v>

803
00:31:26.499 --> 00:31:29.303
once you heat those you turn them into plastics.

804
00:31:29.303 --> 00:31:30.034
<v Voiceover>Well they've already been</v>

805
00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:31.985
heated, Udo told me years ago, they've been heated,

806
00:31:31.985 --> 00:31:33.996
some of them over 500 degrees

807
00:31:33.996 --> 00:31:34.971
just to make them any way.

808
00:31:34.971 --> 00:31:36.434
<v ->In the processing, yeah.</v>

809
00:31:36.434 --> 00:31:37.714
<v Voiceover>So you've got trans fats happening.</v>

810
00:31:37.714 --> 00:31:38.710
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

811
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.619
And when you do that you've got the

812
00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:43.443
raw materials for the paint and varnish industry.

813
00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:44.439
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->In fact,</v>

814
00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:45.374
that's where they get it from,

815
00:31:45.374 --> 00:31:47.060
from McDonald's when they finish

816
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.620
their fructose, they chuck it all out

817
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.144
it goes to the paint factory, varnish factory.

818
00:31:51.144 --> 00:31:52.850
<v Voiceover>And then they make varnish.</v>

819
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.410
Well that's a good thing to know

820
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.234
what's lining our heart rate, my God.

821
00:31:58.234 --> 00:31:59.372
(laughs) Varnish.

822
00:31:59.372 --> 00:32:01.383
Okay, well that's not funny, actually.

823
00:32:01.383 --> 00:32:02.094
<v ->Well it's not.
<v Voiceover>So we</v>

824
00:32:02.094 --> 00:32:03.334
don't want to take that stuff in.

825
00:32:03.334 --> 00:32:04.675
What we do want to take in,

826
00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:06.584
give us an idea of the two saturated,

827
00:32:06.584 --> 00:32:08.169
or three saturated fats you would say

828
00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:09.734
are the healthiest for the body.

829
00:32:09.734 --> 00:32:13.127
<v ->Well, if you've got grass fed cows in your area,</v>

830
00:32:13.977 --> 00:32:15.524
get the butter from them.

831
00:32:15.524 --> 00:32:16.621
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->You don't</v>

832
00:32:16.621 --> 00:32:19.283
want any injections, or any force feeding

833
00:32:19.283 --> 00:32:21.436
or anything like that, just grass fed.

834
00:32:21.436 --> 00:32:22.635
But if you can't get that,

835
00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:24.728
then go to your health food store

836
00:32:24.728 --> 00:32:26.556
and buy coconut oil.

837
00:32:26.556 --> 00:32:27.592
And there is--
<v Voiceover>Organic</v>

838
00:32:27.592 --> 00:32:29.441
is better, I take it?

839
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:30.599
Does it matter?

840
00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:32.103
<v ->I'd buy the Indian stuff.</v>

841
00:32:32.103 --> 00:32:32.956
<v Voiceover>Okay, yeah yeah.</v>

842
00:32:32.956 --> 00:32:33.850
<v ->They've been living on it</v>

843
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.861
all their lives for years and years and year

844
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:36.593
and years.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

845
00:32:36.593 --> 00:32:37.832
Okay, good.
<v ->It's cheap.</v>

846
00:32:37.832 --> 00:32:39.356
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it's not that expensive.</v>

847
00:32:39.356 --> 00:32:41.022
<v ->You can go to any Indian shop</v>

848
00:32:41.022 --> 00:32:44.171
or Indian shop supplier, Asian shop,

849
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:46.020
and they've got it on the shelf.

850
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.092
Go and buy that.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

851
00:32:48.092 --> 00:32:49.982
So coconut oil,

852
00:32:49.982 --> 00:32:53.558
or grass fed organic--
<v ->Butter.</v>

853
00:32:53.558 --> 00:32:55.894
<v Voiceover>No pesticide, I mean no shots or hormones</v>

854
00:32:55.894 --> 00:32:56.585
or anything.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

855
00:32:56.585 --> 00:32:57.418
<v Voiceover>No BSTs.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

856
00:32:57.418 --> 00:32:58.332
<v Voiceover>Butter.</v>

857
00:32:58.332 --> 00:32:59.084
Well that's easy enough.

858
00:32:59.084 --> 00:33:01.278
Not only that, it tastes great too.

859
00:33:01.278 --> 00:33:03.045
<v ->Well, if you haven't got grass fed butter</v>

860
00:33:03.045 --> 00:33:04.346
you can use the coconut oil.

861
00:33:04.346 --> 00:33:05.585
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And it doesn't</v>

862
00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:06.946
taste of coconuts.

863
00:33:06.946 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Voiceover>But what about,</v>

864
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.450
no it doesn't,

865
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.587
but what about olive oil?

866
00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:11.436
I mean, everybody has been led to believe

867
00:33:11.436 --> 00:33:13.305
that extra virgin olive oil

868
00:33:13.305 --> 00:33:14.667
is the best way that you can go.

869
00:33:14.667 --> 00:33:17.633
<v ->Unless you can see the stuff being pressed</v>

870
00:33:17.633 --> 00:33:19.849
I won't trust any of it.

871
00:33:19.849 --> 00:33:22.104
I've tested it in plastic bottles,

872
00:33:22.104 --> 00:33:23.628
I've tested it in green bottle,

873
00:33:23.628 --> 00:33:25.760
dark green bottles, brown bottles, and cans.

874
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.837
<v Voiceover>Glass bottles?</v>

875
00:33:26.837 --> 00:33:27.852
<v ->Yes, glass bottles.</v>

876
00:33:27.852 --> 00:33:29.173
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Dark green glass bottles.</v>

877
00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:31.977
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And it's all plastic.</v>

878
00:33:31.977 --> 00:33:32.546
Why?

879
00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:34.700
Because it's been ultra heat treated,

880
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.346
went into processing.

881
00:33:36.346 --> 00:33:37.605
When they pressed it

882
00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:39.108
they caused the high temperature.

883
00:33:39.108 --> 00:33:42.074
<v Voiceover>Even if it says cold pressed?</v>

884
00:33:42.074 --> 00:33:42.989
If it says cold pressed

885
00:33:42.989 --> 00:33:45.406
that doesn't mean it's been cold, right?

886
00:33:45.406 --> 00:33:49.002
<v ->I tell you, you can take a little experiment,</v>

887
00:33:49.002 --> 00:33:52.660
and this is my acid litmus test.

888
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.646
I take a little bit of whatever I'm

889
00:33:55.646 --> 00:33:58.348
doubtful about, and put it in a little pot

890
00:33:58.348 --> 00:34:00.258
and put it out where the insects

891
00:34:00.258 --> 00:34:02.738
and the flies go.
<v Voiceover>Oh no,</v>

892
00:34:02.738 --> 00:34:04.728
I see where this is going.

893
00:34:04.728 --> 00:34:07.146
<v ->If they don't touch it, you don't touch it.</v>

894
00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:08.710
(laughs)
<v Voiceover>Hey,</v>

895
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.421
that's great.

896
00:34:09.421 --> 00:34:10.579
Now we have, that's what you call

897
00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:11.453
news you can use.

898
00:34:11.453 --> 00:34:12.754
That's very useful information.

899
00:34:12.754 --> 00:34:14.666
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>That's great.</v>

900
00:34:14.666 --> 00:34:15.922
I'll have to try that on a couple things.

901
00:34:15.922 --> 00:34:16.715
<v ->Well, bear in mind--</v>

902
00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:17.710
<v Voiceover>You're saying a lot of these things</v>

903
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:18.421
the oils.
<v ->I've tested all of them</v>

904
00:34:18.421 --> 00:34:20.473
like that.
<v Voiceover>Oh my goodness.</v>

905
00:34:20.473 --> 00:34:23.811
<v ->And molecularly, as well.</v>

906
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:25.979
And, yeah.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

907
00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:28.377
<v ->You can do that simple test.</v>

908
00:34:28.377 --> 00:34:31.709
<v Voiceover>So we can take control of our own lives,</v>

909
00:34:31.709 --> 00:34:34.756
in the sense of at least what we put into our bodies,

910
00:34:34.756 --> 00:34:36.361
the quality of what we put into our bodies.

911
00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:37.560
<v ->This is what we're never told, you see.</v>

912
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.344
We go to school, we're never told how to sit.

913
00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:43.107
We're never told how to stand, how to walk,

914
00:34:43.107 --> 00:34:45.876
how to eat.

915
00:34:46.743 --> 00:34:50.218
And eating, the first part of digestion

916
00:34:50.218 --> 00:34:51.985
actually takes place in the mouth.

917
00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:53.001
<v Voiceover>Chewing.</v>
<v ->Yeah,</v>

918
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:53.976
it's chewing.

919
00:34:53.976 --> 00:34:57.796
Most people it's two chews and swallow it whole.

920
00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:00.498
And they have problems with indigestion

921
00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.153
and stuff like that.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

922
00:35:02.153 --> 00:35:06.431
<v ->This, there's a group in the UK</v>

923
00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:08.340
and there's groups in other places,

924
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.465
but they have 80 chews before they swallow.

925
00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:13.541
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

926
00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:14.517
I guess I've heard of this.

927
00:35:14.517 --> 00:35:15.594
And a lot of people that have

928
00:35:15.594 --> 00:35:16.813
various eating programs say

929
00:35:16.813 --> 00:35:18.479
you have to chew your food.

930
00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:19.332
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>That's like</v>

931
00:35:19.332 --> 00:35:21.689
number one.
<v ->80 times?</v>

932
00:35:21.689 --> 00:35:22.847
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's a lot.</v>

933
00:35:22.847 --> 00:35:23.578
That's a lot.

934
00:35:23.578 --> 00:35:25.386
That would take you a few hours to have a salad.

935
00:35:25.386 --> 00:35:28.678
<v ->Well this group actually have four hour lunches.</v>

936
00:35:28.678 --> 00:35:30.080
<v Voiceover>That makes sense.</v>

937
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.197
Yeah, well okay.

938
00:35:31.197 --> 00:35:32.619
They do in Italy, France any way, so.

939
00:35:32.619 --> 00:35:34.323
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Well so we</v>

940
00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:37.151
start by digesting our food in our mouths.

941
00:35:37.151 --> 00:35:37.821
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>And</v>

942
00:35:37.821 --> 00:35:38.857
putting a better quality in.

943
00:35:38.857 --> 00:35:40.157
But we're still now dealing with the

944
00:35:40.157 --> 00:35:43.368
problem of alkalinity, due to the E-smog.

945
00:35:43.368 --> 00:35:44.505
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>And let's talk</v>

946
00:35:44.505 --> 00:35:47.451
about that, some of the more brand new

947
00:35:47.451 --> 00:35:49.524
and the, as they say, you know,

948
00:35:49.524 --> 00:35:51.657
exotic technologies, as it were

949
00:35:51.657 --> 00:35:53.342
that you have become familiar with

950
00:35:53.342 --> 00:35:55.293
and are actually now dealing with.

951
00:35:55.293 --> 00:35:59.484
<v ->Well they, you can be as calm as you like,</v>

952
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:01.693
you can be the most placid person,

953
00:36:01.693 --> 00:36:03.873
you can be a saint.

954
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.675
In this day and age

955
00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:08.987
you are going to be acidified

956
00:36:08.987 --> 00:36:11.343
exactly the same as the rest of us.

957
00:36:11.343 --> 00:36:12.766
Whether we shout a bowl

958
00:36:12.766 --> 00:36:14.900
or fight or flight,

959
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.666
your body is acidified.

960
00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:19.612
If you make a call on a cellular phone,

961
00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:22.843
a mobile phone, or on a cordless phone,

962
00:36:22.843 --> 00:36:25.200
which most people have in their home.

963
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.060
And that is a transmitting station in your own private.

964
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.178
<v Voiceover>For E-smog.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

965
00:36:30.178 --> 00:36:31.702
<v Voiceover>Yeah yeah.</v>
<v ->It will</v>

966
00:36:31.702 --> 00:36:32.981
generate a transmitting station--

967
00:36:32.981 --> 00:36:34.627
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->in your own home.</v>

968
00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:37.620
And that's doing it 24/7.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

969
00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.209
<v ->So with all of that</v>

970
00:36:41.209 --> 00:36:43.669
the most placid saintly person

971
00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:45.882
who never goes to flight or fight or anything like that,

972
00:36:45.882 --> 00:36:47.915
or thinks a bad thought

973
00:36:47.915 --> 00:36:49.804
is extremely acidified.

974
00:36:49.804 --> 00:36:51.714
Especially if they use those things.

975
00:36:51.714 --> 00:36:54.965
But bearing in mind if the near fields and far fields

976
00:36:54.965 --> 00:36:56.853
are exactly the same.

977
00:36:56.853 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about some of the technologies</v>

978
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.075
that are out there now that can change that.

979
00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:04.537
<v ->Well, there's lots of companies,</v>

980
00:37:04.537 --> 00:37:05.694
and quite a few in America

981
00:37:05.694 --> 00:37:08.173
that have tried to raise public awareness

982
00:37:08.173 --> 00:37:11.262
and come out with technology which they think

983
00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:15.203
is keeping pace with the

984
00:37:16.023 --> 00:37:18.352
state of play of technology.

985
00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:20.181
Sadly, technology has moved ahead

986
00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:22.781
faster than they can develop.

987
00:37:22.781 --> 00:37:25.564
But there is one physicist from Germany,

988
00:37:25.564 --> 00:37:28.024
he was in the black forest along with

989
00:37:28.024 --> 00:37:31.680
Professor Mile, whose down in the Fort (mumbling University.

990
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.524
I'll tell you a little story about him, as well.

991
00:37:34.524 --> 00:37:37.771
About E-smog and mobile phones.

992
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.431
Any way

993
00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:43.054
he's down there,

994
00:37:43.054 --> 00:37:44.246
Professor Miles down there,

995
00:37:44.246 --> 00:37:47.152
as well, but Walter Laufs,

996
00:37:47.152 --> 00:37:51.357
who is the founder of this IHIT

997
00:37:51.357 --> 00:37:55.665
technology, which is Inverted Harmonized

998
00:37:55.665 --> 00:37:58.510
Information Technology.

999
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.931
<v Voiceover>Can we find that on the web yet?</v>

1000
00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:01.739
<v ->No, not on the web yet.</v>

1001
00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:04.687
Because

1002
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:08.423
there is a web being brought up.

1003
00:38:08.423 --> 00:38:09.155
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->But it's</v>

1004
00:38:09.155 --> 00:38:09.907
in German at the moment.

1005
00:38:09.907 --> 00:38:10.658
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->And it will</v>

1006
00:38:10.658 --> 00:38:11.411
be coming in English.

1007
00:38:11.411 --> 00:38:12.447
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about the IHIT.</v>

1008
00:38:12.447 --> 00:38:13.687
<v ->As soon as it is I will let you know.</v>

1009
00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:15.311
But the IHIT, Walter is over here now,

1010
00:38:15.311 --> 00:38:18.258
he's got his company registered in Florida.

1011
00:38:18.258 --> 00:38:21.740
And that's his own name, WillArTech

1012
00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.740
LLC.

1013
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.790
And he's here for the long haul.

1014
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.903
And he's asked me to come over here too

1015
00:38:28.903 --> 00:38:30.305
because he only speaks German,

1016
00:38:30.305 --> 00:38:32.825
to get the news of his technology out.

1017
00:38:32.825 --> 00:38:35.446
This IHIT technology

1018
00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:37.681
which is actually dealing with

1019
00:38:37.681 --> 00:38:41.804
not only the transverse waves of the

1020
00:38:41.804 --> 00:38:43.735
electromagnetic spectrum,

1021
00:38:43.735 --> 00:38:46.498
and all the E-smog as we know it.

1022
00:38:46.498 --> 00:38:48.062
But E-smog is made up of more

1023
00:38:48.062 --> 00:38:49.647
than electromagnetic waves,

1024
00:38:49.647 --> 00:38:51.354
it's made up of scalar waves.

1025
00:38:51.354 --> 00:38:54.158
Scalar waves are longitudinal waves.

1026
00:38:54.158 --> 00:38:55.478
It's actually a field,

1027
00:38:55.478 --> 00:38:58.789
it's a dimension, if you might.

1028
00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:01.574
Because scalar waves deal with vorteces,

1029
00:39:01.574 --> 00:39:03.523
and vorteces go all directions.

1030
00:39:03.523 --> 00:39:06.042
So, but they bump up against each other.

1031
00:39:06.042 --> 00:39:08.481
And this is how information is moved.

1032
00:39:08.481 --> 00:39:11.798
It's not a wave, rather it's--

1033
00:39:13.297 --> 00:39:14.983
<v Voiceover>An interference pattern of some kind.</v>

1034
00:39:14.983 --> 00:39:17.075
<v ->Yeah, when all interference on the radio,</v>

1035
00:39:17.075 --> 00:39:18.883
which would see eddy currents,

1036
00:39:18.883 --> 00:39:21.930
that's disturbing the scalar fields.

1037
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.007
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1038
00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:25.690
So what does this,

1039
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.558
what does this technology do then?

1040
00:39:27.558 --> 00:39:29.874
I mean, beyond what you just said,

1041
00:39:29.874 --> 00:39:31.195
what does it do, effectively?

1042
00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:35.508
<v ->It, by inversion of the various wave forms,</v>

1043
00:39:36.477 --> 00:39:39.937
you'll actually generate when the

1044
00:39:40.317 --> 00:39:42.918
the caring frequency, or the

1045
00:39:42.918 --> 00:39:46.032
modulated frequency is going up.

1046
00:39:47.062 --> 00:39:50.273
By virtue of the fact of the strength of that signal,

1047
00:39:50.273 --> 00:39:53.570
his device generates a down signal.

1048
00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:57.161
And, when this one comes down,

1049
00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.635
on the frequency, this one comes up.

1050
00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:01.792
<v Voiceover>So it negates it?</v>

1051
00:40:01.792 --> 00:40:03.458
<v ->So it just cancels it out.</v>

1052
00:40:03.458 --> 00:40:04.760
<v Voiceover>Totally.</v>
<v ->But</v>

1053
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.465
it cancels it out

1054
00:40:06.465 --> 00:40:08.030
in the phone.

1055
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.736
So the system.

1056
00:40:13.506 --> 00:40:14.795
Yeah, the system.

1057
00:40:14.795 --> 00:40:17.802
The electrosmog fields,

1058
00:40:17.802 --> 00:40:19.509
and all the transmittance

1059
00:40:19.509 --> 00:40:21.540
have sent the signal to the phone.

1060
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.913
You don't need it to have any of its bad

1061
00:40:24.913 --> 00:40:27.209
information anymore.

1062
00:40:27.209 --> 00:40:30.642
It's through to the electronics of the firm

1063
00:40:30.642 --> 00:40:33.956
phone going to generate an audible signal.

1064
00:40:33.974 --> 00:40:38.430
This is a different beast to the electronics

1065
00:40:38.891 --> 00:40:41.024
that bought the wave there.

1066
00:40:41.024 --> 00:40:41.655
Okay?

1067
00:40:41.655 --> 00:40:44.032
So once it's at the phone through the aerial,

1068
00:40:44.032 --> 00:40:45.941
then the chip comes in.

1069
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:49.253
And it then, by virtue of its inverting

1070
00:40:49.253 --> 00:40:52.788
and harmonizing, all the other radiations

1071
00:40:52.788 --> 00:40:55.409
which are in the area

1072
00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:56.912
brings all of that inverted

1073
00:40:56.912 --> 00:41:00.183
harmonized information technology

1074
00:41:00.183 --> 00:41:03.476
to bear on your physical well-being.

1075
00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:05.100
<v Voiceover>So are you saying that when you have</v>

1076
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.193
your cell phone, it's actually then good for you

1077
00:41:07.193 --> 00:41:08.535
instead of bad for you, is what you're saying?

1078
00:41:08.535 --> 00:41:09.387
<v ->Yep, yep.</v>

1079
00:41:09.387 --> 00:41:10.404
<v Voiceover>Actually how does it,</v>

1080
00:41:10.404 --> 00:41:12.313
what does it do, how does it boost your health?

1081
00:41:12.313 --> 00:41:15.889
<v ->Well I had these devices tested,</v>

1082
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:18.788
because I met Walter in 2004

1083
00:41:19.058 --> 00:41:22.276
and when I as writing my book

1084
00:41:23.296 --> 00:41:26.921
that's titled, "A Handy Way to Cook Your Brain."

1085
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:27.855
(laughs)
<v Voiceover>That's very good</v>

1086
00:41:27.855 --> 00:41:28.830
very--
<v ->Because the handy</v>

1087
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:33.042
is in Europe and Malaysia, and other places

1088
00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.698
it's known, the cell phone is known as a handy phone.

1089
00:41:35.698 --> 00:41:37.161
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And so</v>

1090
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.152
it was a play on words.

1091
00:41:39.152 --> 00:41:40.967
So any way.

1092
00:41:46.201 --> 00:41:48.314
So any way, getting back to Walter

1093
00:41:48.314 --> 00:41:49.533
because that's the main thing

1094
00:41:49.533 --> 00:41:50.895
he's mentioned in there.

1095
00:41:50.895 --> 00:41:53.576
But all of the testing of this,

1096
00:41:53.576 --> 00:41:57.951
we had done by, we tried to get

1097
00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:01.725
the universities interested in testing it.

1098
00:42:01.725 --> 00:42:05.340
One friend of mine in the UK was so enamored

1099
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.367
with its performance she took it to Alistair Philips

1100
00:42:08.367 --> 00:42:11.802
to power watch in the UK.

1101
00:42:11.802 --> 00:42:14.707
And because there's nobody who can measure

1102
00:42:14.707 --> 00:42:17.837
information in the world today, well.

1103
00:42:17.837 --> 00:42:19.663
<v Voiceover>Scalar?</v>
<v ->Scalar.</v>

1104
00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:21.025
That's not true,

1105
00:42:21.025 --> 00:42:23.485
there are two people who can have meters

1106
00:42:23.485 --> 00:42:25.983
that can measure scalar waves.

1107
00:42:25.983 --> 00:42:29.192
And more energies, as well.

1108
00:42:29.192 --> 00:42:33.166
Line up both of them, and both of them are a big response.

1109
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:38.447
They didn't have anything that could do that.

1110
00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:42.585
So they got an electrician screwdriver

1111
00:42:42.585 --> 00:42:44.393
and started picking apart with it

1112
00:42:44.393 --> 00:42:47.441
and testing it with currents and things like that.

1113
00:42:47.441 --> 00:42:50.062
Which was all they knew.

1114
00:42:50.062 --> 00:42:52.750
And they said it doesn't work.

1115
00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:55.202
And that's the trouble, you get a lot of people

1116
00:42:55.202 --> 00:42:59.387
who got their antiquated methodologies

1117
00:42:59.387 --> 00:43:02.089
and they're testing something ultra new

1118
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:05.645
and they say, "Well, I don't get a reading here."

1119
00:43:05.645 --> 00:43:09.038
I was in Texas at a convention down there

1120
00:43:09.038 --> 00:43:12.919
and I had somebody who had a moving iron

1121
00:43:12.919 --> 00:43:14.646
deflection meter.

1122
00:43:14.646 --> 00:43:19.446
And he said, "Well, it's not producing many of those."

1123
00:43:20.091 --> 00:43:22.915
And I said, "Well, I wouldn't think it would do."

1124
00:43:22.915 --> 00:43:25.374
"Most of them", he said, "Go right across here."

1125
00:43:25.374 --> 00:43:27.588
And I said,"You're measuring the wrong thing."

1126
00:43:27.588 --> 00:43:28.867
And he said, "What wrong thing?"

1127
00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:31.000
And he just had no clue.

1128
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.235
<v Voiceover>Well have there been any studies</v>

1129
00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:34.984
or any doctors who have worked with it

1130
00:43:34.984 --> 00:43:36.039
and found anything?

1131
00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:39.067
<v ->There's scientists in this country,</v>

1132
00:43:39.067 --> 00:43:40.225
Tom Bearden is one.

1133
00:43:40.225 --> 00:43:41.526
<v Voiceover>Oh, Tom Bearden?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1134
00:43:41.526 --> 00:43:42.399
<v Voiceover>That's impressive.</v>

1135
00:43:42.399 --> 00:43:44.186
<v ->He's one of them, okay?</v>

1136
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:45.913
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>
<v ->And you have others</v>

1137
00:43:45.913 --> 00:43:48.291
who are trying to push the boat out

1138
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:49.265
in this country.

1139
00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:52.029
But they're beating their head against a brick wall.

1140
00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:55.829
You had a brilliant Austrian researcher

1141
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:59.161
from a University of Graz, who came across here,

1142
00:43:59.161 --> 00:44:02.371
worked up at Northwestern, and he tried to,

1143
00:44:02.371 --> 00:44:05.073
we're going back to this Lyme disease,

1144
00:44:05.073 --> 00:44:07.449
he tried to raise the awareness,

1145
00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:11.208
one of those not streptococcus, staphacoccus

1146
00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:15.765
Coxsackie, Coxsackie B, and Coxsackie B three.

1147
00:44:16.632 --> 00:44:19.823
This virus can kill you in a week.

1148
00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:21.407
And it has killed a lot of people.

1149
00:44:21.407 --> 00:44:23.459
Fit people, as well.

1150
00:44:23.459 --> 00:44:26.731
He tried to raise the awareness of this,

1151
00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:29.392
and he met resistance, after resistance,

1152
00:44:29.392 --> 00:44:30.347
after resistance.

1153
00:44:30.347 --> 00:44:31.404
He was so disheartened

1154
00:44:31.404 --> 00:44:33.557
that he went back to Graz in Austria.

1155
00:44:33.557 --> 00:44:35.304
<v Voiceover>Well now, there was one person</v>

1156
00:44:35.304 --> 00:44:37.093
that when we were talking earlier,

1157
00:44:37.093 --> 00:44:38.982
you told me about someone, and sorry,

1158
00:44:38.982 --> 00:44:41.400
I wasn't writing it down at the time,

1159
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.771
who had dealt with this technology and said,

1160
00:44:44.771 --> 00:44:46.418
"We're looking at something that's almost

1161
00:44:46.418 --> 00:44:48.347
"you know, a century ahead of everything

1162
00:44:48.347 --> 00:44:49.730
"else that's happening right now."

1163
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:50.766
What's that one?

1164
00:44:50.766 --> 00:44:54.057
<v ->This was a doctor I showed,</v>

1165
00:44:54.057 --> 00:44:56.047
it's called the ETAScan.

1166
00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:57.978
And the ETAScan is a device.

1167
00:44:57.978 --> 00:44:59.360
<v Voiceover>Oh yes, okay, so that's it.</v>

1168
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.476
ETAScan, the portion of it.

1169
00:45:00.476 --> 00:45:02.204
<v ->ETA comes from the Greek.</v>

1170
00:45:02.204 --> 00:45:04.662
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->ETA meaning,</v>

1171
00:45:04.662 --> 00:45:07.669
that what we cannot measure at this time.

1172
00:45:07.669 --> 00:45:08.685
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->They were</v>

1173
00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:11.895
pretty smart cookies back in those days.

1174
00:45:11.895 --> 00:45:14.475
They realized that they didn't know at all.

1175
00:45:14.475 --> 00:45:18.870
We sadly, in our collective academia,

1176
00:45:19.412 --> 00:45:21.586
think we do know it all.

1177
00:45:21.586 --> 00:45:24.410
And there are doctors and researchers in the world,

1178
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.214
I belong to a group of 108 of them,

1179
00:45:27.214 --> 00:45:30.058
which know that we don't know it all.

1180
00:45:30.058 --> 00:45:31.216
In fact, the more we know,

1181
00:45:31.216 --> 00:45:33.431
the more we realize we don't know.

1182
00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:37.108
And we are pushing back any boundaries

1183
00:45:37.108 --> 00:45:39.119
of information science,

1184
00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:41.685
and information medicine.

1185
00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:45.830
And Walter, who has this IHIT,

1186
00:45:45.844 --> 00:45:47.734
he's pushing back his little corner

1187
00:45:47.734 --> 00:45:49.684
of information science.

1188
00:45:49.684 --> 00:45:52.874
And so with the ETAScan, we've,

1189
00:45:52.874 --> 00:45:55.373
this is coming through Europe

1190
00:45:55.373 --> 00:45:59.396
into great usage, because chiropractors,

1191
00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:01.895
regular therapists, doctors,

1192
00:46:01.895 --> 00:46:06.121
alternative practitioners, companies,

1193
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:08.985
have all used his ETAScan

1194
00:46:08.985 --> 00:46:11.484
because it gives you empirical proof

1195
00:46:11.484 --> 00:46:13.618
of whatever methodologies you're using

1196
00:46:13.618 --> 00:46:15.893
are effective.
<v Voiceover>By reading</v>

1197
00:46:15.893 --> 00:46:17.153
the frequencies of your body,

1198
00:46:17.153 --> 00:46:18.555
the information of everything.

1199
00:46:18.555 --> 00:46:19.774
<v ->The information of everything.</v>

1200
00:46:19.774 --> 00:46:20.566
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->We now know,</v>

1201
00:46:20.566 --> 00:46:22.679
and you can go to any particle physicist,

1202
00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:26.255
you can go to any quantum mechanic physicist,

1203
00:46:26.255 --> 00:46:29.344
you can go to even string theorists,

1204
00:46:29.344 --> 00:46:32.676
you can go to particle accelerates,

1205
00:46:32.676 --> 00:46:35.316
you can go to any nuclear people.

1206
00:46:35.316 --> 00:46:38.812
These know that matter is comprised

1207
00:46:38.812 --> 00:46:40.579
of energy and information.

1208
00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:42.306
When these two come together

1209
00:46:42.306 --> 00:46:44.276
matter comes into a form.

1210
00:46:44.276 --> 00:46:45.028
<v Voiceover>When energy information</v>

1211
00:46:45.028 --> 00:46:46.166
come together, matter.
<v ->This is what</v>

1212
00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:47.568
information came from,

1213
00:46:47.568 --> 00:46:49.599
the Latin informoray,

1214
00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.204
And infomoray means

1215
00:46:51.204 --> 00:46:53.790
brings into form, in form,

1216
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.202
to bring into form.

1217
00:46:56.202 --> 00:46:58.174
And so we're now beginning to wake up

1218
00:46:58.174 --> 00:47:00.834
to what is information?

1219
00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:02.236
And how is it helping us?

1220
00:47:02.236 --> 00:47:04.837
How is it damaging us?

1221
00:47:04.837 --> 00:47:07.597
Dr. Masari Moto of Japan,

1222
00:47:07.597 --> 00:47:11.197
he's doing one, pushing back the firm of boundaries,

1223
00:47:11.197 --> 00:47:12.943
and how information is changing the

1224
00:47:12.943 --> 00:47:14.873
crystal structure of water.

1225
00:47:14.873 --> 00:47:15.625
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1226
00:47:15.625 --> 00:47:17.962
Beautiful work.
<v ->Well it is.</v>

1227
00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:19.465
But some of it, when you say something

1228
00:47:19.465 --> 00:47:21.862
nasty to somebody, or water,

1229
00:47:21.862 --> 00:47:23.508
and remember our cardiovascular system

1230
00:47:23.508 --> 00:47:25.777
is 94% water any way,

1231
00:47:25.777 --> 00:47:28.479
so it's a lot off you.

1232
00:47:28.479 --> 00:47:31.954
And, well unless you've got toxic chemicals in there.

1233
00:47:31.954 --> 00:47:33.214
(laughing)

1234
00:47:33.214 --> 00:47:37.298
So if I was to say something nice to you,

1235
00:47:37.298 --> 00:47:41.300
this would have a beautiful hexagonal

1236
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.170
crystal structure.

1237
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.055
If I was to say something nasty to you,

1238
00:47:46.055 --> 00:47:47.497
and I wouldn't say that because I know

1239
00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.370
what it does to you,

1240
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.159
but what you hear children calling

1241
00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:52.128
each other in the playground,

1242
00:47:52.128 --> 00:47:56.213
and other people who are upset with other people,

1243
00:47:57.953 --> 00:48:00.724
they call each others names.

1244
00:48:00.724 --> 00:48:02.715
When you look at the work of Dr. Himoto,

1245
00:48:02.715 --> 00:48:06.087
and see the effect that has on water.

1246
00:48:06.087 --> 00:48:07.042
<v Voiceover>It's devastating.</v>

1247
00:48:07.042 --> 00:48:08.748
<v ->You would never ever say it again.</v>

1248
00:48:08.748 --> 00:48:10.251
<v Voiceover>The water turns very unstructured.</v>

1249
00:48:10.251 --> 00:48:13.157
<v ->A lot of people over here</v>

1250
00:48:13.157 --> 00:48:16.062
in the western world decry Dr. Himoto,

1251
00:48:16.062 --> 00:48:18.561
and say, "That is unrepeatable."

1252
00:48:18.561 --> 00:48:19.414
What he's doing.

1253
00:48:19.414 --> 00:48:21.527
Therefore, it's not science.

1254
00:48:21.527 --> 00:48:23.905
The reason it's not science, in their eyes,

1255
00:48:23.905 --> 00:48:25.916
is because they can't be repeat it.

1256
00:48:25.916 --> 00:48:27.989
And every scientific experiment

1257
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:29.289
should need to be able to repeat it

1258
00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:30.507
again and again and again.

1259
00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:32.275
By different people, to get the same result.

1260
00:48:32.275 --> 00:48:32.884
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1261
00:48:32.884 --> 00:48:35.709
<v ->And that gives it accreditation.</v>

1262
00:48:35.709 --> 00:48:38.106
That's what peer review is all about.

1263
00:48:38.106 --> 00:48:40.199
But we're into this new field now

1264
00:48:40.199 --> 00:48:42.657
where the peers are so backward

1265
00:48:42.657 --> 00:48:45.379
and close minded, we don't even bother

1266
00:48:45.379 --> 00:48:47.960
asking them to review the papers anymore.

1267
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.180
<v Voiceover>And they can't measure consciousness,</v>

1268
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.414
and we're talking about a consciousness interface--

1269
00:48:51.414 --> 00:48:52.573
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>with technology.</v>

1270
00:48:52.573 --> 00:48:55.294
<v ->And we're one, this is the information</v>

1271
00:48:55.294 --> 00:48:58.281
because the conscious gives out thoughts

1272
00:48:58.281 --> 00:48:59.723
and thoughts are information.

1273
00:48:59.723 --> 00:49:02.914
In fact this is what certain physicists did,

1274
00:49:02.914 --> 00:49:04.884
they looked at an energy chamber

1275
00:49:04.884 --> 00:49:08.278
and they always thought of what they wanted to see.

1276
00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.186
And lo and behold it appeared.

1277
00:49:10.186 --> 00:49:12.828
So they coined the phrase, the consciousness

1278
00:49:12.828 --> 00:49:14.351
creates matter.

1279
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:15.124
It doesn't.

1280
00:49:15.124 --> 00:49:17.582
Only God creates, okay?

1281
00:49:17.582 --> 00:49:18.516
What they're doing

1282
00:49:18.516 --> 00:49:21.320
is they're providing the information

1283
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.226
through their thoughts into the energy chamber.

1284
00:49:24.226 --> 00:49:26.521
Two energy and information come together

1285
00:49:26.521 --> 00:49:29.126
the matter comes into being.

1286
00:49:29.126 --> 00:49:32.149
<v Voiceover>So how's this play back to the ETAScan?</v>

1287
00:49:32.149 --> 00:49:35.197
<v ->The ETAScan is the first device in the world</v>

1288
00:49:35.197 --> 00:49:37.371
to be able to take matter

1289
00:49:37.371 --> 00:49:39.849
and separate it into its constituent,

1290
00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:42.043
energy and information.

1291
00:49:42.043 --> 00:49:45.423
And then display the energy in one method

1292
00:49:45.423 --> 00:49:49.378
on the condition of the templates,

1293
00:49:49.378 --> 00:49:51.267
or the systems of the body.

1294
00:49:51.267 --> 00:49:53.766
Whether it's (mumbling) sections

1295
00:49:53.766 --> 00:49:56.611
or histonic sections, it doesn't matter.

1296
00:49:56.611 --> 00:49:59.720
Or even down to the cells, or just stuff in the blood.

1297
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.951
All of this is given an energetic picture,

1298
00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:05.531
but there's also an information picture

1299
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:08.213
and this is scalar info which is put out

1300
00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:11.707
in a linear fashion so that we can recognize it.

1301
00:50:11.707 --> 00:50:13.637
<v Voiceover>So this in effect can show you</v>

1302
00:50:13.637 --> 00:50:16.620
in plain sight, what that's going on inside your body?

1303
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.370
<v ->Yeah, It's not only energetically,</v>

1304
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.854
which most other devices do,

1305
00:50:19.854 --> 00:50:21.906
but also the underlying information

1306
00:50:21.906 --> 00:50:24.181
which is causing the condition in the first place.

1307
00:50:24.181 --> 00:50:25.359
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's the key, isn't it?</v>

1308
00:50:25.359 --> 00:50:28.509
<v ->Because the pathology is the progression</v>

1309
00:50:28.509 --> 00:50:30.845
from health to disease.

1310
00:50:30.845 --> 00:50:33.934
And this is what information medicine is all about.

1311
00:50:33.934 --> 00:50:37.163
It's about getting onto that path

1312
00:50:37.163 --> 00:50:39.825
and then correcting it back through the crisis,

1313
00:50:39.825 --> 00:50:42.507
through the healing, and back to health.

1314
00:50:42.507 --> 00:50:44.514
And unless you go through that healing crisis

1315
00:50:44.514 --> 00:50:46.550
you'll never get back to health.

1316
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.989
<v Voiceover>And that's saying the ETAScan device</v>

1317
00:50:48.989 --> 00:50:52.951
that is measuring these disharmoneous frequencies

1318
00:50:52.951 --> 00:50:56.791
can also inject healing frequencies?

1319
00:50:56.791 --> 00:51:00.245
<v ->Well it's not frequencies, per se,</v>

1320
00:51:00.245 --> 00:51:02.235
it's information.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:51:02.235 --> 00:51:05.099
<v ->And information is scalar in form,</v>

1322
00:51:05.099 --> 00:51:09.188
so by virtue

1323
00:51:09.188 --> 00:51:11.723
of the power of the ETAScan

1324
00:51:11.723 --> 00:51:14.994
it can improve the energetic picture.

1325
00:51:14.994 --> 00:51:16.314
And in certain cases,

1326
00:51:16.314 --> 00:51:18.488
can also completely radicate,

1327
00:51:18.488 --> 00:51:20.561
or show you your on the line

1328
00:51:20.561 --> 00:51:23.913
to completely radicate the causal conditions.

1329
00:51:23.913 --> 00:51:25.579
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And you can</v>

1330
00:51:25.579 --> 00:51:28.037
see the percentage in empirical terms.

1331
00:51:28.037 --> 00:51:29.886
<v Voiceover>Right, and that's really key.</v>

1332
00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:32.588
<v ->And so, yeah, that is key.</v>

1333
00:51:32.588 --> 00:51:34.051
Because without that information

1334
00:51:34.051 --> 00:51:35.494
disrupt the flow

1335
00:51:35.494 --> 00:51:36.794
you'll never get to.

1336
00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:38.480
<v Voiceover>And how people use this?</v>

1337
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.410
I mean.
<v ->In Europe it's</v>

1338
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:41.325
phenomenal.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:51:41.325 --> 00:51:44.352
<v ->Five doctors using and they now bought</v>

1340
00:51:44.352 --> 00:51:45.652
these ETAScans.

1341
00:51:45.652 --> 00:51:46.932
They use it with their patients.

1342
00:51:46.932 --> 00:51:47.867
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And it's bringing</v>

1343
00:51:47.867 --> 00:51:51.381
a new day into healing, and wellness.

1344
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:54.984
Because for the first time we can see,

1345
00:51:55.343 --> 00:51:56.745
we can see cancer.

1346
00:51:56.745 --> 00:51:57.639
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->Not only in</v>

1347
00:51:57.639 --> 00:51:59.752
the tissues, but also the information.

1348
00:51:59.752 --> 00:52:01.784
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And with the</v>

1349
00:52:01.784 --> 00:52:03.917
electrosmog that we're finding today,

1350
00:52:03.917 --> 00:52:07.995
which is moved from the analog phones of yesteryear

1351
00:52:07.995 --> 00:52:09.627
yesteryear.

1352
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:14.224
To the microwave phones of

1353
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.924
yesterday.

1354
00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:19.521
To the bluetooth phones, which are

1355
00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:21.309
evident today.

1356
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:24.966
We've moved up into the giga hertz range,

1357
00:52:24.966 --> 00:52:26.916
from the analog which were down

1358
00:52:26.916 --> 00:52:28.358
in the radio frequencies.

1359
00:52:28.358 --> 00:52:30.512
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->Of kila hertz.</v>

1360
00:52:30.512 --> 00:52:31.954
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->So we've moved up</v>

1361
00:52:31.954 --> 00:52:35.469
into mega hertz, and then giga hertz.

1362
00:52:35.469 --> 00:52:40.270
And these frequencies are causing

1363
00:52:40.711 --> 00:52:44.394
a corruption of the DNA in our cells.

1364
00:52:44.977 --> 00:52:48.573
And in a lot of cases I find, with the ETAScan,

1365
00:52:48.573 --> 00:52:50.869
I find that unfortunately,

1366
00:52:50.869 --> 00:52:55.204
cancer information is being relayed to those.

1367
00:52:55.664 --> 00:52:57.677
And I was down in Texas

1368
00:52:57.677 --> 00:52:59.077
a little while ago,

1369
00:52:59.077 --> 00:53:01.515
and I found a lady who had everything

1370
00:53:01.515 --> 00:53:04.077
in her thorax and retro space

1371
00:53:04.077 --> 00:53:07.191
was malignant cancer.

1372
00:53:07.469 --> 00:53:10.131
Her spleen, pancreas, duradaneum,

1373
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:13.015
kidneys, liver, you name it,

1374
00:53:13.015 --> 00:53:15.677
everything was cancer down there.

1375
00:53:15.677 --> 00:53:17.444
And that's not natural.

1376
00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:19.152
One thing, you'll find that.

1377
00:53:19.152 --> 00:53:20.736
<v Voiceover>Can this be fixed through?</v>

1378
00:53:20.736 --> 00:53:21.712
<v ->Yeah it can be fixed.</v>

1379
00:53:21.712 --> 00:53:22.726
<v Voiceover>Scalar information?</v>

1380
00:53:22.726 --> 00:53:24.413
<v ->Yep, it can be fixed.</v>

1381
00:53:24.413 --> 00:53:26.404
Yep.
<v Voiceover>So essentially</v>

1382
00:53:26.404 --> 00:53:28.334
if you can get to the information.

1383
00:53:28.334 --> 00:53:30.061
<v ->Well I found the cause of her condition.</v>

1384
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:30.793
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Was her DNA.</v>

1385
00:53:30.793 --> 00:53:31.767
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And it was</v>

1386
00:53:31.767 --> 00:53:32.702
in her E group,

1387
00:53:32.702 --> 00:53:34.612
we've got 23 groups,

1388
00:53:34.612 --> 00:53:36.848
and they're A to G,

1389
00:53:36.848 --> 00:53:39.793
and her E group were very very badly.

1390
00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:42.312
And the tech facilities

1391
00:53:42.312 --> 00:53:44.101
I could see that controlled

1392
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:46.904
the whole area in her thorax,

1393
00:53:46.904 --> 00:53:48.529
and down there.

1394
00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:51.598
And so I was able to correct her DNA,

1395
00:53:51.598 --> 00:53:53.913
which will lead to her correction of everything else

1396
00:53:53.913 --> 00:53:55.193
in her body.

1397
00:53:55.193 --> 00:53:56.920
Because every cell in her body is--

1398
00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.079
<v Voiceover>And she's alive and well today?</v>

1399
00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.683
<v ->She's alive and well today.</v>

1400
00:53:59.683 --> 00:54:01.883
I saw her in,

1401
00:54:03.463 --> 00:54:05.900
I was at the Venetian in.

1402
00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.994
<v Voiceover>Las Vegas.</v>
<v ->Las Vegas, yes.</v>

1403
00:54:07.994 --> 00:54:10.329
She was there, brimming with health.

1404
00:54:10.329 --> 00:54:12.016
<v Voiceover>So the good news is,</v>

1405
00:54:12.016 --> 00:54:13.745
we're about running out of time.

1406
00:54:14.795 --> 00:54:16.770
The good news is

1407
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.920
that there are these new technologies

1408
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.118
that are light years ahead.

1409
00:54:21.118 --> 00:54:22.682
We're now taking, no pun intended,

1410
00:54:22.682 --> 00:54:23.963
a quantum leap, because we're going

1411
00:54:23.963 --> 00:54:25.730
into quantum healing now.

1412
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:26.603
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>That is the</v>

1413
00:54:26.603 --> 00:54:27.335
future.
<v ->Well,</v>

1414
00:54:27.335 --> 00:54:28.289
Dr. Chris Kaufmann,

1415
00:54:28.289 --> 00:54:30.768
who I tested with the ETAScan,

1416
00:54:30.768 --> 00:54:32.577
he's got more machines,

1417
00:54:32.577 --> 00:54:33.673
he's got a RIFE machine,

1418
00:54:33.673 --> 00:54:35.603
he's got the QXEI,

1419
00:54:35.603 --> 00:54:38.916
he's got the, he's got all of them.

1420
00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:42.003
And he uses all of them daily.

1421
00:54:42.003 --> 00:54:43.162
But when he saw this

1422
00:54:43.162 --> 00:54:45.376
he said it was 100 years ahead

1423
00:54:45.376 --> 00:54:47.184
of anything that he's gotten in his practice.

1424
00:54:47.184 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Voiceover>That's where I heard that 100 year thing.</v>

1425
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:49.602
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Well that's</v>

1426
00:54:49.602 --> 00:54:50.821
fabulous.

1427
00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:52.141
So that's the good news.

1428
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:53.706
That these technologies now exist.

1429
00:54:53.706 --> 00:54:54.336
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>That we</v>

1430
00:54:54.336 --> 00:54:55.495
don't have to be afraid

1431
00:54:55.495 --> 00:54:58.380
of the kinds of disease we were afraid of in the past.

1432
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.029
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1433
00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:00.899
And it gives the doctor the where it all

1434
00:55:00.899 --> 00:55:03.661
to the question, all the doubt,

1435
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:06.424
all the guess work out of medicine.

1436
00:55:06.424 --> 00:55:08.172
<v Voiceover>And also take the fear out of the patient,</v>

1437
00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:09.106
right?
<v ->And take the fear</v>

1438
00:55:09.106 --> 00:55:09.797
out of the patient.

1439
00:55:09.797 --> 00:55:11.808
Because as I say in our video

1440
00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:12.601
which we produced,

1441
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:14.470
there's absolutely no reason

1442
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.030
for anyone to suffer in all health

1443
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:18.920
in this day.

1444
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.890
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's amazing.</v>

1445
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:23.186
Now, the bad news is

1446
00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.832
this is all still fairly new,

1447
00:55:24.832 --> 00:55:26.233
and not everybody can't get to one of these

1448
00:55:26.233 --> 00:55:28.490
and it can't be done remotely.

1449
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:29.221
Right?
<v ->No.</v>

1450
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:30.683
<v Voiceover>You have to actually find someone</v>

1451
00:55:30.683 --> 00:55:32.430
who has one, so we can only hope

1452
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:35.194
that people start creating a demand for it,

1453
00:55:35.194 --> 00:55:36.819
asking their doctors have they checked out

1454
00:55:36.819 --> 00:55:40.212
the technology, asking other types of practitioners.

1455
00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:44.343
<v ->There's a doctor in New York, Washington, has got one.</v>

1456
00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:48.827
There's two doctors in Sarasota that's got them.

1457
00:55:48.827 --> 00:55:51.082
And a third clinic is coming.

1458
00:55:51.082 --> 00:55:53.175
They want to see me this week.

1459
00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:54.352
So.
<v Voiceover>Well it's</v>

1460
00:55:54.352 --> 00:55:55.857
starting, but I mean, it's all over Europe,

1461
00:55:55.857 --> 00:55:57.929
but we're quite behind in the US on this.

1462
00:55:57.929 --> 00:55:58.720
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

1463
00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Voiceover>For probably obvious reasons.</v>

1464
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.749
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Well so as time</v>

1465
00:56:01.749 --> 00:56:04.186
goes on I, and this interview will be up

1466
00:56:04.186 --> 00:56:06.908
for quite a while, I'm expecting that as people

1467
00:56:06.908 --> 00:56:08.494
come to your site they're going to be able to find

1468
00:56:08.494 --> 00:56:10.687
information on more and more people

1469
00:56:10.687 --> 00:56:12.415
who are able to offer this service.

1470
00:56:12.415 --> 00:56:13.775
In the meantime we have to take

1471
00:56:13.775 --> 00:56:14.872
good care of ourselves.

1472
00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:18.713
But in the interim we can detox with the bamboo.

1473
00:56:18.713 --> 00:56:19.911
<v ->With the bamboo.</v>

1474
00:56:19.911 --> 00:56:21.070
<v Voiceover>That technology out of Japan.</v>

1475
00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.285
<v ->And we have bought a whole--</v>

1476
00:56:23.285 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Voiceover>Oh good.</v>

1477
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.230
<v ->boat load of the stuff.</v>

1478
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:26.312
And you've really done a lot of research

1479
00:56:26.312 --> 00:56:27.286
on a lot of products from around the world.

1480
00:56:27.286 --> 00:56:28.241
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>So people</v>

1481
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:29.481
can if they just get a hold of you

1482
00:56:29.481 --> 00:56:30.598
they can probably find out

1483
00:56:30.598 --> 00:56:31.898
what they need to hook up with

1484
00:56:31.898 --> 00:56:33.015
to take care of themselves.

1485
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.356
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Until if and</v>

1486
00:56:34.356 --> 00:56:35.392
when they can get to someone

1487
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:38.765
who actually can do an ETAScan process for them.

1488
00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:39.884
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1489
00:56:39.884 --> 00:56:42.280
<v ->Well, with more doctors waking up to this</v>

1490
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.967
it's really taking off.

1491
00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.795
<v Voiceover>And using technology with</v>

1492
00:56:45.795 --> 00:56:47.969
your cell phone and other field generators

1493
00:56:47.969 --> 00:56:50.651
that knock out these unhealthy diseases.

1494
00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:52.967
<v ->With Walters products, I mean, these are just</v>

1495
00:56:52.967 --> 00:56:54.369
they're so wonderful.

1496
00:56:54.369 --> 00:56:56.075
And as I say, I've had many many

1497
00:56:56.075 --> 00:56:58.229
top people test them.

1498
00:56:58.229 --> 00:56:59.102
And every one of them

1499
00:56:59.102 --> 00:57:00.870
including Dr. Misara Moto.

1500
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:03.085
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Was so absolutely</v>

1501
00:57:03.085 --> 00:57:05.868
knocked sideways by their effectiveness.

1502
00:57:05.868 --> 00:57:07.879
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->They had to sit down in</v>

1503
00:57:07.879 --> 00:57:09.444
their chair.
(crosstalk)

1504
00:57:09.444 --> 00:57:10.785
<v Voiceover>Take it in.</v>
<v ->And then</v>

1505
00:57:10.785 --> 00:57:13.731
they just said, "Where can I get these?

1506
00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:16.738
"I want to take them out to my whole group."

1507
00:57:16.738 --> 00:57:20.476
So these products are already around the world.

1508
00:57:20.476 --> 00:57:22.304
I mean, from New Zealand, to Japan,

1509
00:57:22.304 --> 00:57:23.463
to everywhere.

1510
00:57:23.463 --> 00:57:25.271
And the west coast of Ireland,

1511
00:57:25.271 --> 00:57:27.851
they're now just bringing them into

1512
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:29.415
well, Walters over here.

1513
00:57:29.415 --> 00:57:31.346
His companies are registered here

1514
00:57:31.346 --> 00:57:33.926
that's getting these things out to the world.

1515
00:57:33.926 --> 00:57:35.612
And he's gotten away with it all too.

1516
00:57:35.612 --> 00:57:38.964
Absolutely trounce electro smog

1517
00:57:38.964 --> 00:57:39.838
in your home.

1518
00:57:39.838 --> 00:57:41.423
Clear it up completely

1519
00:57:41.423 --> 00:57:42.825
and with with Air Neutralizer.

1520
00:57:42.825 --> 00:57:43.698
<v Voiceover>Then your body can start</v>

1521
00:57:43.698 --> 00:57:45.506
getting its alkaline state back.

1522
00:57:45.506 --> 00:57:46.604
<v ->Alkaline state back.</v>

1523
00:57:46.604 --> 00:57:48.148
<v Voiceover>And your cancer can't form so easily.</v>

1524
00:57:48.148 --> 00:57:49.651
<v ->Won't even be there.</v>

1525
00:57:49.651 --> 00:57:51.547
<v Voiceover>Can't even be there.</v>

1526
00:57:52.211 --> 00:57:53.471
<v ->For more information on some of</v>

1527
00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:55.929
Dr. James' products that he just spoke of,

1528
00:57:55.929 --> 00:57:57.493
just click on the link below.

1529
00:57:57.493 --> 00:58:00.094
You can also reach him directly through this link.

1530
00:58:00.094 --> 00:58:01.476
We've used some of the products

1531
00:58:01.476 --> 00:58:03.142
and find them to be an integrity.

1532
00:58:03.142 --> 00:58:06.256
Until next time, thanks for watching.
