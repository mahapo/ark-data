00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
our favorite interviewees,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Hank Wesselman, is back and
talking about shamanic healing.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.710 align:middle line:84%
As an anthropologist
working on some

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830 align:middle line:84%
of the most prestigious
archaeological sites

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.850 align:middle line:84%
in the world, Hank entered
another more hidden world

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.290 align:middle line:84%
over 20 years ago,
quite by accident.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
This is chronicled in our
first interview with him.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
As the years progressed, he
became a shaman and a healer.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:84%
In this interview, he offers
an extraordinary opportunity

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
for the Western
world to understand

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:84%
how the shaman of the
world can heal people

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:84%
of virtually every disease
known to man by including

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:90%
the step of healing the soul.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HANK WESSELMAN:
Experiences that I

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:90%
had in Hawaii back in the 1980s.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I was literally drawn,
kicking and screaming,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
into the world of the
shaman, where I became,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:84%
in addition to being a
wandering anthropologist,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I became a kind of
wandering medicine man.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.542 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this
tradition, you remember

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:84%
when we talked
about the shaman, we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
talked about an
individual who was

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
able to achieve altered
states of consciousness.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
There are different
levels of depth.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's light trance
and there's very deep trance.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
In light trance, the individual
can continue to function.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, I
found that I was

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
being trained by these folks on
the other side of the mirror,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
as the Native American
people sometimes

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
refer to them, the
folks in the next room.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And I began to access
a body of knowledge

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and a body of
information that directed

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%
me to become a medicine man.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the shaman's
world, as you recall,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
the shaman is the one who
achieves these levels of trance

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
in which they're
able to dissociate

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
their conscious awareness
away from their physical body

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.105 align:middle line:84%
and enter into a non-ordinary
level of reality awareness

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and experience in which
they connect with spirits.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The spirits of nature,
the spirits of ancestors,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
spirits of animals,
plants, higher spirits,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:90%
angelic spirits.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
These spirits are
essentially forces

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
which are poised just beyond
the boundary of this world

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that we all take so
much for granted.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
They're poised to help
us in various ways.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And from the
shaman's perspective,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
they've been doing this
for a very long time.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.942 align:middle line:84%
Now in the shaman's
world, the shaman

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
has a certain
holistic perspective

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
which Western physical medicine
doctors don't tend to have.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:90%
At least not until recently.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
For the shaman, illness
gains much of its power

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.185 align:middle line:84%
and its meaning from
its spiritual aspect.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
everything in existence

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
has a physical form,
an energetic aspect,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual form.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman is the one
who's adept at working

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
with the spiritual
aspect of the illness.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if the illness can
be diminished at that level,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
it will diminish its
energetic expression,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
which in turn will help the
physical body to restore itself

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to a state of natural
balance and harmony.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the shaman's
world, the shaman

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
uses everything
at their disposal

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
in confronting illness.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And for the shaman, physical
medicine and spirit medicine

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
are like two halves
of a single whole.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.925 align:middle line:84%
The goals-- the purpose of the
practice of spirit medicine

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and physical medicine are
somewhat different, however.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
As we're all very much
aware, the primary purpose

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of the practice of
physical medicine,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Western physical medicine,
is the avoidance of death

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:90%
and the prolongation of life.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what Western
medicine is really good at.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
In spirit medicine,
the primary purpose

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
of the practice
of spirit medicine

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
is to nurture and
preserve the soul.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And when your soul is in good
shape, you're in good shape.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To create-- keep
harmony going within the soul.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.208 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: That's it.

00:03:56.208 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But when your soul is in shreds,
you've got a serious problem.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Now I might add
here that shamans,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in their essential role
as healers, you know,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
if a warrior were brought into
camp with an arrow sticking out

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
of his body, that would not
be the time to grab the rattle

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.207 align:middle line:90%
and go into trance.

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We could say the same thing
about our own culture.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
If somebody were in a
serious car accident,

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and they were
bleeding internally,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
this would not be the time
to go to your acupuncturist.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.095 align:middle line:84%
This would be the time
to find yourself alone

00:04:28.095 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
in a room with world class
surgeon, anaesthesiologist,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and medical team.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
This would be the time
for physical medicine.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And all shamans know a great
deal about physical medicine.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:90%
They're good at it.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.395 align:middle line:90%
The spirit medicine comes later.

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It comes later.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, it--

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when you say
later, is that by necessity?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Or is it simply
how people normally

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
respond in linear
fashion to trauma,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
that they start examining the
spiritual component later?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Are there not preemptive
uses of spirit medicine

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to
become out of harmony

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and ill to begin with?

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: Yeah.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with expanded
awareness and paying attention.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I might throw in that the
shaman is very concerned

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
with the relationship
between cause and effect.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:90%
They have to be.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You see, from the
shaman's perspective,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
we come into life as embodied
beings and things happen to us

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:90%
here on the physical plane.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
As kids we fall off our bikes.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We get stubbed toes, sports
injuries, mumps, measles,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
chickenpox, colds,
flus, and viruses.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And we could go down the list
of what happens to children.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:84%
As we mature into
adults, we continue

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to have accidents in the
kitchen, get in car wrecks,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
we get colds and flus
and viruses, all right?

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Things continue to happen.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And some of us are unlucky
and we get serious illnesses

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of an internal
nature like cancer

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
or lupus or heart
disease or HIV.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we pass
through old age

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and the progressive infirmity of
and death of the physical body.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
These are all to be expected
as we pass through life.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But from the
shaman's perspective,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%
they're all effects.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And what the shaman is
interested in is the cause.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if I can just
interject a question at this

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
point, and I want you to
continue your lineage there.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: Please do.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you--
it's not just individual,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.365 align:middle line:84%
it's also a collective
experience, so--

00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Yes,
there does seem

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
to be a resonance that exists
within groups of people,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and certain illnesses
become preponderant.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
It may have something to do
with the spiritual field which

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
permeates and interpenetrates
certain social groups.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the mystery.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.884 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we don't really know.

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:90%
But we do see patterns.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
From the shaman's
perspective, there

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
are three classic
causes of illness.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, they're not
bacteria, viruses, or microbes.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
They're states that we
move into in response

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
to traumas, as a rule.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Trials, tests, and
tribulations in life.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the first classic
cause of illness

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
from the shaman's
perspective is disharmony.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what we would
call it in the West.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Disharmony is a state
that we move into, usually

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.309 align:middle line:84%
as a result of some sort of
catastrophic loss experience.

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Like when you've
got an older couple,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and they've been married
together for 40 or 50 years.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And God knows they haven't
had a perfect relationship.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.435 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there
are times when you

00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
wonder how grandma and
grandpa ever stayed together.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But deep down, there's this
incredible bond between them

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because of everything
they've endured, everything

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:90%
they've been through together.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And one night, one of
them makes transition.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Within six months to a year,
often, not always, but often,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
the surviving spouse will come
down with something serious,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:90%
and they're gone.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We could talk about
somebody losing their job,

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
losing their livelihood,
losing their label,

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
their sense of
professional identity.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a corporate
executive, a CEO.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's make it a
woman, 50 years old.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.417 align:middle line:84%
One day, the good old
guys in her corporation,

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
they have a business
meeting, and they

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.885 align:middle line:84%
decide they could hire
some hotshot right out

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
of business school for 1/3 of
her salary, so they let her go.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And she has a
lifestyle that goes

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
with her corporate
executive status.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, six months later, she's
still sending out her resume,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
trying to get
rehired at her level.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
And at her level,
that's very difficult.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:90%
Remember, she's just been fired.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, she goes for
her annual exam,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and she's given
the grim diagnosis.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
She has cancerous cells in
her uterus, or in her breast,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:90%
or in her armpit.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, without claiming
anything supernatural here,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that her cancer
is a response to the disharmony

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that she has moved into
in losing her livelihood.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
The way in which
disharmony affects people,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is it diminishes them at the
level of their personal power.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
When your power goes down,
when you've had power loss,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.464 align:middle line:90%
you're vulnerable to illness.

00:09:15.464 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've noticed that
after I give one of my midterm

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
exams, you know, I
always have a bunch

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:90%
of students who don't do well.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably,
they all come down

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
with the flu or
colds in response

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to having had this kind of
trauma of seeing their grade

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
point average plunge in response
to one of my killer exams.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, disharmony.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The second major cause of
illness in the shaman's world

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:90%
is fear.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Fear is not good for you.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who's walking around
with a chronic sense of fear

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
enveloping them, it diminishes
their sense of well being.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And that sense of well being,
that sense of being well,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation for their
personal health system.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
When their sense of
well being goes down,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:90%
their immune system goes down.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:84%
The ability of their
immune system to function

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:90%
is diminished.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And when your immune system
goes down, you're in trouble,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.572 align:middle line:84%
There was an
incredible case, this

00:10:11.572 --> 00:10:13.155 align:middle line:84%
was published in the
scientific press.

00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it was published
in the "New England Journal

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of Medicine," about a boy who
was born at UCLA medical school

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:90%
to an HIV positive mother.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
This was back in the
late '90s, 95, 96, 97.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
It's referenced in my
book "Spirit Medicine."

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:90%
This boy was born HIV positive.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:90%
He was tested at 19 days of age.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And a month later, he was tested
again and he was HIV positive.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.485 align:middle line:90%
There was no question.

00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Now this was a special child.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So this child was
put into foster care.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:90%
I believe the mother passed.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:90%
He was put into foster care.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
He went through
preschool, kindergarten,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and when he was
in first grade, he

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
showed absolutely
no signs of HIV.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So they tested him
again, and lo and behold,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:90%
he was HIV negative.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to tell from the test

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that the disease was not
lurking dormant waiting

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
to spring on him.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Now is it possible,
again, without claiming

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
anything, that this
boy's immune system,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
lacking the fear that the
knowledge of having this dread

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
disease would
generate in one of us.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that his immune
system simply went to work

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and killed the virus
as it's programmed

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to do by the evolutionary
software that's

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
programmed into these bodies?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it was Paracelsus,
300 or 400 years ago,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
the renaissance
physician and alchemist,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
who made the observation
that the fear of disease

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:84%
is more dangerous than
the disease itself.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the disease
may or may not get you,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
but the fear is going
to get you every time.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the Western physician,
it's no news to anybody

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that disharmony and fear
can manifest themselves

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
as illnesses which
are recognizable

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:90%
to Western science.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is no news.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But the third class
of cause of illness

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is the one which is
the most dangerous.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the phenomenon
which is known as soul loss.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, curiously, among
the indigenous people,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:84%
soul loss is regarded
as the primary cause

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.559 align:middle line:84%
of premature death
and serious illness.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even mentioned in
our Western medical textbooks.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.022 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to go to
your PCP, your Primary Care

00:12:20.022 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Physician, and
said, you know, I've

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle line:84%
had a terrible soul
loss experience.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
he or she would say?

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you've got a
good one, right, he or she

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.834 align:middle line:84%
would say, gee, could you
tell me more about that?

00:12:29.834 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Listen, there are a lot of
medicine men and medicine

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:90%
women in our medical system.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
find a good one.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, soul loss.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Soul loss implies damage to
our personal essence, our soul.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
That essence of who
and what we are.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And this damage usually occurs
in response to serious trauma.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.085 align:middle line:84%
Now these traumas begin
the moment we're born.

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, we could
have an incoming soul

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.020 align:middle line:84%
who was born as a girl when
everybody was hoping for a boy.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And the whole family
just turns away.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be the reverse.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
A family with four
boys, and here

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
comes a girl-- here
comes another boy.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And the whole family
just turns away.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The last time I spoke
with Stanislav Grof, who

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
was one of the fathers of
transpersonal psychology,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
he talked about the fact that
he was deeply concerned, now

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
in his '70s, with perinatal
birth issues traumas

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and how they set up that
individual's entire life

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.472 align:middle line:84%
by what happened at the
time they were born.

00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
the kind of work

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
he does with the holotropic
breathing, right?

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Well
that's part of it.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.865 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:13:37.865 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But you know, soul
loss is what happens

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
to a child who is sent into
preschool or kindergarten

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and who's traumatized
by their peer group.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Who is physically attacked, or
mentally attacked, or teased

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and bullied, day
after day after day.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a form of
psychic assault.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.255 align:middle line:84%
Soul loss is what
happens to a child who

00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:90%
is abused or neglected.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Or you could say, to a
person who's molested.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Or an adult or
child who was raped.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Very often, the
trauma is so great

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that the soul is totally
traumatized by what's

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And the entire soul
will dissociate away

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:90%
from the physical body.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And in response to the
trauma, it will often fission.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It will fracture,
and parts of the soul

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
will simply dissociate, and
they will remain disassociated,

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
often carrying the memories
of the trauma with them.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can see that this could
be a life coping mechanism.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, many of us remember
the Central Park jogger

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in New York, the woman who
was so terribly brutalized,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:84%
attacked and raped, and she
was virtually unrecognizable.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:90%
She has no memory of that event.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I finally saw her
interviewed on television.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:90%
She had no memory of the event.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a classic
example of soul loss.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But you can also see that
remembering that trauma

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:90%
would not serve her.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It would psychologically
traumatize her further.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the soul loss
was a life coping mechanism.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
does one go and begin

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to heal that, knowing that
it's not in her best interest

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.127 align:middle line:84%
to be consciously
aware of that event?

00:15:17.127 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Well, we're
going to get there.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.231 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: But
let me just mention,

00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:84%
because I know this is
part of the teaching

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:90%
that people find riveting.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
That soul loss can occur in
response to a serious surgery.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Anesthesia is very
traumatizing to the soul.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.448 align:middle line:84%
It can occur in response
to a terrible car accident.

00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:37.323 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
many people have come up

00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:38.989 align:middle line:84%
to me over the years
and said, you know,

00:15:38.989 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I was a terrible car
wreck five years ago,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and I've never been the same.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like part of me is missing.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS] Ding.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the key term.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Part of me is missing.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Or you'll have somebody
who was at a terrible,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, the car wreck
that happened in car racing

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.521 align:middle line:90%
when Dale Earnhardt was killed.

00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
People will say, part of me
left when Dale was killed.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, part of me is
still in that stadium.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I've just never gone back
and seen another one.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:90%
This kind of thing.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Or an acrimonious divorce.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:90%
A shocking betrayal.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:84%
For women, often a miscarriage
or a serious abortion,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
a traumatic abortion,
can create soul loss.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And through my
wife's practice, you

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
can't imagine how many
people, how many women,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.974 align:middle line:84%
have told her of the soul
loss that they suffered

00:16:33.974 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
on the day they got married.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:84%
When one person
gives up their dreams

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
so that the other
person can live there.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Soul loss is what happened to
all those young men and women

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
we sent to Korea and Vietnam,
Operation Desert Storm, and now

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Iraq.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The military calls this post
traumatic stress syndrome,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and they come home as
the walking wounded.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, this is soul loss.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, our
military doctors, the VA,

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
has no idea what to really
do for these people.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
They have to restore the
fabric of their soul.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
And our Western
trained physicians

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:90%
are not trained to do that.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
They don't really understand
the nature of this dynamic.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Now the symptoms
of soul loss are

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:84%
very easy to recognize if you
know what you're looking for.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:90%
We've mentioned one.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Blocked memory.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
When a person can not remember
whole parts of their life,

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:90%
this is indicative of soul loss.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
When somebody is
emotionally remote,

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.614 align:middle line:84%
when there's nobody
home emotionally,

00:17:35.614 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
there's nobody to
receive the love

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that you have to offer
them, or to give you

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:90%
the love that you need.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Chronic negativity.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who is always
focused on the negative,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:90%
who's always down.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
A sudden onset of
apathy or listlessness.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly life seems pointless.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.919 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is worth anything.

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cla-- this
sounds like also a lot

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.060 align:middle line:90%
of classic depression symptoms.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Despair, suicidal
tendencies, addictions,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:90%
all involve soul loss.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And the classic
symptom of soul loss,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
you've just given it to
me; is chronic depression.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
This brings up
something strange.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
About 10 years ago, maybe
more, in the early '90s,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.673 align:middle line:84%
there was a Time Magazine cover
story on Depression in America.

00:18:21.673 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I may have this wrong,
I believe it was called,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.859 align:middle line:90%
Prozac Breakfast of Champions.

00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:29.525 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was
Time's way of talking

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
in a glib way about a
very serious subject.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But that article revealed
that at that time somewhere

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
in the neighborhood of
60 million Americans

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:84%
were taking antidepressant
drugs on a daily basis

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:90%
to control their moods.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
That's-- at that time, that was
roughly 30% of the population.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
This reveals the degree
to which soul loss

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:90%
is a very serious problem.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, after 9/11--
9/11 was on a Tuesday.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
On Friday, I remember
the ticker tape

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:84%
going across the bottom
of my television screen,

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
saying 7 out of 10
Americans suffering

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
significant depression
in response to 9/11.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
There's soul loss
on a national scale.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason soul
loss is so dangerous is

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that these vacant places
in the soul cluster,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:84%
in the nature of the soul, are
open invitations for intrusive

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
elements to come in
and take up residence.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:84%
In the shaman's world, illness
is regarded as an intrusion.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
As something that comes in
to the body from without.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
This is true in Western
medicine as well.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whether it be a
virus, bacteria, mold, whatever.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Viruses, bacteria,
you know, an arrow, OK?

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But we can also talk about
negative thought forms.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Negative emotions, like fear.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
These can be intrusions.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, when your soul is in
good shape, no problems.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.216 align:middle line:90%
No worries then.

00:19:51.216 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you're
working in an office,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a coworker
who's jealous of you,

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:90%
or envious of you.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Who is constantly
sarcastic with you,

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
constantly leveling
bad thoughts at you.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Always thinking bad
things about you.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Or you've got a set
of hostile in-laws

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:90%
who never find you worthy.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.825 align:middle line:84%
Or a neighbor who's always
angry and vitriolic with you.

00:20:13.825 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.742 align:middle line:90%
An ex who cannot let go.

00:20:16.742 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting
down at the Pizza Hut,

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.366 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you're
getting these weird vibes,

00:20:20.366 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and you look over,
and then there he

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
or she is across
the room, looking

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:90%
at you with this-- you know.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the modus operandi
of negative witchcraft

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:90%
in a traditional society.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Those negative thought
forms and intentions

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
can be internalized like
spiritual poison darts.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And when your soul
is in shreds, when

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
there are these
great gaping holes,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
these intrusive elements,
these negative elements,

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
can enter and take up
residence like guests.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Carolyn Myss, I talked to
Carolyn Myss about this years

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:90%
ago when we are at a conference.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the Association
for Humanistic Psychology

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Annual Conference
back in the late '90s.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
She regards them
as energy circuits

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that circulate within
your energetic matrix.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course most of our
listeners are aware of the fact

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that your energy
body expands out

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
to about three feet on each side
around your physical matrix,

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
We actually live inside
of our energetic matrix.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, these negative thought
forms and intrusions,

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.045 align:middle line:84%
or traumatic memories,
memories of something terrible

00:21:25.045 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that happened, when we
turn in their direction,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
it's like we feed
them, because energy

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:90%
flows where your attention goes.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:84%
These circuits are
constantly drawing

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
from your available daily
supply of life force.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
They're diminishing us at the
level of our power supply.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue to
collect these stones

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:84%
in your bowl of
light, so to speak.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
They diminish us on
a daily basis, 24/7.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the shaman's
world, healing

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
involves dealing both with the
spiritual aspects of illness

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and with the
energetic expression

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:90%
of those spiritual aspects.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So from the shaman's
perspective,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
the very first
thing that you have

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
to do for somebody
who's suffering

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.285 align:middle line:84%
is augment their
personal power supply.

00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go-- let's
take a consistent thing.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That woman who's 50 years
old who lost her job,

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:90%
lost her sense of identity.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.697 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about if she were
to enter the shamanic world.

00:22:26.697 --> 00:22:28.405 align:middle line:84%
Let's continue and
use her as an example.

00:22:28.405 --> 00:22:28.945 align:middle line:90%
And get something concrete.

00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: All Right.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
If that woman came
to me, you know,

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I've been a shamanic
practitioner now for 24 years.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
24th year of my
apprenticeship now.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've been teaching
for about 13, 14 years.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If that woman were to come to
me, the first thing I would do

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.590 align:middle line:90%
is empower her.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the very first thing a
shaman will do for a client.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
This is because healing
cannot take place

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
if you're in a
disempowered state.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It just isn't going to work.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in an empowered
place for healing to take.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I
would do is empower her.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way
to do that would

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:84%
be to bring her into a
relationship with a healing

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:90%
spirit or spirit helper.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual helper who'd be
willing to channel power,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:90%
protection, and support to her.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I would do
is I would dissociate

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:84%
my conscious awareness,
quickly, into the other world.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.434 align:middle line:90%
And I would put out the call.

00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, Regina, you're
coming to me for an empowerment.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, who is
ready, willing, and able

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
to come into a
relationship with Regina

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to provide her with power,
protection, and support?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Now immediately, something or
someone would step forward.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The frequency with which these
spirits manifest themselves

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
as animals has given rise
to the term power animal.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.392 align:middle line:84%
And often it's an animal
spirit, like the tiger.

00:23:52.392 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:84%
You have special relationship
with tigers, don't you.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: Yes, you do.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
You see, that is
just something that

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
was just right over here,
which was obvious to me.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Big cats in general.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.512 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And born in
the year of the tiger.

00:24:04.512 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: All right.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.149 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did I know that?

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.689 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, it's-- there's
always somebody in attendance

00:24:09.689 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
who's sort of letting me
know what's-- you know,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, it can be incredibly
empowering for a person

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
to know that there's
a spirit who's

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:84%
coming into a
relationship with them.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
This can be an angelic
experience-- spirit.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:90%
It could be an ancestor.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It could be a spirit of
some wise old medicine man

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or medicine woman, an
indigenous person, perhaps.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's amazing how
often Native American spirits

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
are coming into relationship
with people of Anglo, Hispanic,

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:84%
African American ancestry,
because these spirits came

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:90%
to be of service.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're still very
much in relationship

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:90%
with the human sphere.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And they really don't care
all that much about ethnicity.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
What they're interested in is
to see if your heart is open.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they are
offering to come

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
into a relationship with
you, this is big time.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And people's lives often
change very quickly

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:84%
once a helping spirit
has been brought

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.019 align:middle line:90%
into a relationship with them.

00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Shamans are good at doing this.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Our Western physical
doctors, you know,

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
they'll get better
at it with practice,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:84%
but they don't really
know about this yet.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many of us go to
our primary care physician

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.086 align:middle line:90%
and get an empowerment?

00:25:24.086 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second stage of
healing involves diagnosis.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, Western doctors are
superb diagnosticians.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:90%
They are really good at this.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:90%
So are shamans.

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But the shaman is dealing
with a more complete deck,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
they're also dealing

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:84%
with the energetic and spiritual
aspects of that individual's

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:90%
matrix.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Now for the shaman, diagnosis
involves both their expertise,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
but it also involves the
shaman's relationship

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
with certain spirits who are
good at doing diagnostic work.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is
known as divination

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
in indigenous societies,
where the shaman will access

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
information from the other
side of great meaning

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to the person who's come
to them as a client.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
When I do this work as
a shamanic practitioner,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I hook up with one of
my spiritual helpers,

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the ones
who works with me.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And with the
client's permission,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
with the individual's
permission,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:90%
we journey as a team.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I actually invite the
spirit to possess me.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
This is called trance
mediumship, in which I

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
invite a spirit to come in and
take up residence within me

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and we work together as a team.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And we actually journey
into that person's body

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:90%
looking for the intrusions.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I remember many years
ago, a young woman

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
was at a workshop I was doing
up in northern California.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And this young woman
was about 20 years old,

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and she had
endometriosis already.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, as your listeners
are very much aware,

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
it's-- endometriosis involves
an outgrowth of the lining

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of the uterus into the body
cavity, the endometrium.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And with her permission,
I journeyed into her body

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:90%
to take a look at her uterus.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was
very interesting.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.331 align:middle line:84%
I saw a spider clamped
around her uterus.

00:27:17.331 --> 00:27:19.122 align:middle line:84%
And the spider was
literally clamped-- now,

00:27:19.122 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
a uterus is ordinarily
about that big.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:84%
It was clamped around her
uterus and it was squeezing.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And the evagination
of the lining

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of uterus out through
the fallopian tubes

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:84%
into the body cavity
was being caused

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:90%
by this intrusive element.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I remember another individual
with irritable bowel syndrome.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
As I was cruising
inside their colon,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the inside of
their colon, which ordinarily

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is white and sort of pearly,
and gleaming with ridges,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw the entire inside
of the colon was moving.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Was in movement.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked
closely, I saw scorpions.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Little flesh colored
scorpions that

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:84%
were skittering around,
and stinging, and pinching,

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Now that doesn't mean
that individual really

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
has scorpions in
their intestines,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:90%
or a spider around their uterus.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
This is just a metaphorical
way, a symbolic way,

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of perceiving the
intrusive element.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
with that woman,

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.171 align:middle line:84%
if you don't mind going
back to the one who

00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
had the spider
around the uterus,

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
as you looked shamanically
into her life,

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
into more of the soul
force, et cetera,

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
do you remember
much about that one?

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.139 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in her
life that created this?

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:29.805 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: I talked
to her afterwards.

00:28:29.805 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Without-- this is
personal stuff,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and on the risk-- on the
chance that her family might

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.990 align:middle line:84%
be listening in, this was
actually a family issue.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And it involved a
lot of negativity

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
which had been subconsciously,
not consciously,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
but subconsciously directed
towards this young girl

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
by a member of her family
when she became a woman at 14.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
She had had painful
menstrual periods ever

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:90%
since she was 14 years old.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Every time she would get her
monthlies, agonizing pain.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And so this was the issue.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Now what the shaman
does, in this case,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
is extract-- that's the
third stage of healing--

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
once the intrusions
have been perceived,

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's not difficult
to perceive them

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:90%
if you know what you're doing.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
The intrusions need
to be extracted.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
They need to be taken out
of that person's field

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:90%
and removed.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in traditional
societies, shamans often

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:90%
use their mouth to do this.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
They're called sucking doctors.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.305 align:middle line:84%
And you may go into a tr-- I've
had the experience in Africa

00:29:36.305 --> 00:29:38.340 align:middle line:84%
of going into a
traditional village

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and seeing somebody lying flat
on their back with somebody,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and their head clamped
to that person's abdomen,

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:90%
vigorously sucking away.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And then after about
15 or 20 minutes,

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.890 align:middle line:84%
they'll spit something
into their hand.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And you look at this,
and you say, what's that?

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
it's a chicken gizzard,

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:90%
or a piece of meat or a stone.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And you think the
guy's faking it.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:90%
You know, I know what that is.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what the shaman has
done is put this in their mouth

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.546 align:middle line:84%
as a trap to catch the
intrusion when it comes out.

00:30:08.546 --> 00:30:11.631 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're dealing with
somebody who has lupus or HIV,

00:30:11.631 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the last thing you'd want to
do is suck in at your own body.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that's what
I was just going to ask,

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
is energetically,
where would that go.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- they use
this almost as a sponge.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: The shaman is
extracting the energetic aspect

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
of the intrusive element
out of the person's field.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:84%
They're dealing with it
at the spiritual level,

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:84%
with their spiritual
helpers on the one hand.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But they're also extracting
the energetic aspect out.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you
can see an object,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and the person who's had
the extraction sees that,

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
this reinforces their
own expectation of cure.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Their own belief that
something has really

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:90%
been taken out of their body.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.344 align:middle line:84%
And this of course elicits
the well known placebo effect,

00:30:53.344 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:84%
which is extraordinarily
powerful.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:30:55.593 --> 00:30:56.292 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: All right?

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So extraction, the shaman
extracts the illness

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
causing agent out of
this person's body

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:90%
using spirits to help them.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the case
of the spider, I'm

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:90%
not real wild about spiders.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I used chopsticks.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to touch it.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:90%
So I used spiritual chopsticks.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went
into her abdomen

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.490 align:middle line:84%
with these spiritual chopsticks
and very carefully pried it

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.490 align:middle line:90%
off her uterus.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I kind of held it out,
and one of my spirit helpers

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:90%
ate it.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.520 align:middle line:90%
This is extraction work.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of us who have had
extraction work done often

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:90%
have extraordinary responses.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I had an extraction
done on my shoulder

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.295 align:middle line:90%
once for chronic tendinitis.

00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:44.400 align:middle line:84%
It had been bothering
me for years.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I had one extraction.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.702 align:middle line:84%
And within two weeks, it was
gone, and it's never come back.

00:31:49.702 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, without any
medical intervention.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
This woman down
in Topanga Canyon

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:90%
did an extraction for me.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And pulled this thing
out of my shoulder,

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and my shoulder healed.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:90%
The harmony was restored.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
makes perfect sense.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
People who are still
looking at life

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:84%
from a very linear, third
dimensional point of view,

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
this can be difficult if we have
only one aspect or dimension

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:90%
to our being.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:90%
There are doctors for that.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But if we understand that we
are multidimensional creatures

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and we have aspects of
ourselves living in these hyper

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:84%
spatial or other dimensional
areas with its own reality

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.100 align:middle line:84%
energetically, this
makes perfect sense.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: Yes.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.308 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a
different perspective.

00:32:34.308 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, we're
very objective in the way

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.424 align:middle line:90%
in which we define reality.

00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:84%
But when you
understand that there

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
are objective levels of
reality and subjective levels

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of reality, our thoughts, our
emotions, and our feelings

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:90%
are real.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And those subjective
experiences can

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:84%
have an enormous effect
on the physical body.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's given
rise to the whole field

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:84%
of psychoneuroimmunology,
which is essentially mind body

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Which is an up and
coming field, and has

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.950 align:middle line:90%
been for the last 15 years.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the final element in
healing, in shamanic healing,

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:84%
involves restoring the
fabric of that person's soul.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you've got-- let's
say you've got window screens,

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.786 align:middle line:84%
and it's summer, and
you've got a torn screen.

00:33:19.786 --> 00:33:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You can kill all the
mosquitoes in your room.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:84%
You can extract those
intrusive elements

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.970 align:middle line:90%
which are in your system.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But unless you repair
the screen, the fabric

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
of the screen,
there's no guarantee

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
that these intrusive elements
are not going to return.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So this involves this
mysterious practice

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%
known as soul retrieval.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And soul retrieval is
becoming more and more popular

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
in the West as more
people become aware

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
of the power of this
healing modality.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Soul retrieval involves
the shamanic practitioner

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:84%
essentially hooking up
with their spiritual team

00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and then going to find those
dissociated parts of the self

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to return them to the
person who lost them.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, psychologists,
psychiatrists, they

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:90%
know all about dissociation.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But where do those
dissociated parts go?

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:84%
See, this falls into
the shaman's domain.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Those dissociated
parts are usually

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:84%
found in what the Celtic
people called the other world.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Or the spirit world,
or the dream time

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Australian aboriginals,
which is arranged into layers.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And often those dissociated
parts of the self

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:84%
are being taken care of by a
spiritual ally of some sort.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Like a dissociated
part of the self which

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:84%
has gone into the dream
world may actually

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:84%
be being taken care
of by an ancestor.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
A revered grandparent who
has already crossed over,

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:84%
who's taking care of that
little girl or that little boy

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.139 align:middle line:90%
who had that brutal experience.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
And that little boy or
little girl has not returned.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's still there with
grandma in the dream world.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So the shaman hooks up
with their team of spirits

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and finds these
disassociated parts,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and often has to coax them
back into a relationship,

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
because they may have forgotten
who they were originally

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.630 align:middle line:90%
connected to.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
In the Pacific Northwest coast,
people who do soul retrieval,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:84%
shamans who do soul retrieval,
are often called soul catchers.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And soul catchers
are regarded as being

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in a league of their
own as healers.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.614 align:middle line:84%
There may be many
shamans in a village,

00:35:28.614 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:84%
but there may not
be anybody who's

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:90%
really good as a soul catcher.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very high work.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Its specialty work, and those
people who are good at it

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.501 align:middle line:90%
are like national treasures.

00:35:39.501 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I discovered quite
by accident that I'm

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:90%
married to a great soul catcher.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
This was interesting, because
my wife, Jill Kuykendall,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:84%
was working in acute care
rehabilitation in a hospital

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.160 align:middle line:90%
here in Sacramento.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And she began to have these
experiences in which there'd

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:84%
be somebody who'd had open
heart surgery the day before,

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who'd been
a terrible accident, who

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:90%
was recovering.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And she begin to perceive,
because she's very clairvoyant,

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.240 align:middle line:84%
she began to perceive these
interesting visual phenomena,

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.490 align:middle line:84%
like a flickering in the
air next to the person who

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:84%
had heart surgery
the day before.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.462 align:middle line:84%
And it was my wife's job
to get that person out

00:36:18.462 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:84%
of bed and walking the
day after their surgery.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And here, this person
would be filled with fear,

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.687 align:middle line:84%
with pain, uncertainty,
and my wife

00:36:26.687 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:84%
would have to deal with
all these different levels

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:84%
of this individual to
help them get out of bed

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.572 align:middle line:90%
and stand up for the first time.

00:36:35.572 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And there would
be this flickering

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.740 align:middle line:84%
next to that person which would
suddenly [SNAP] disappear.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, this person
looks at my wife and says,

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%
what did you do?

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And my wife would say,
gee, I'm wondering

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:90%
how I'm going to chart this.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But she began to perceive
things like this.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And when she came and talked
to me about it, I said,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:84%
it sounds to me like you're
doing a kind of soul retrieval.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we began to talk
about soul retrieval,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and it began to happen
more and more frequently.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And I became aware of the fact
that her spirits were actually

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:13.509 align:middle line:90%
teaching her.

00:37:13.509 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, she wasn't
learning this from me,

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:84%
she wasn't learning it from
any ordinary reality teacher.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.070 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't learning
it in a workshop.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.665 align:middle line:84%
She was learning it
directly from her spirits.

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, to make a
long story short,

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.930 align:middle line:84%
she's now been in private
practice for over 10 years,

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and she has a full time
transpersonal medical practice

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.959 align:middle line:84%
in soul restorative
work, in soul retrieval.

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: People come
from all over the country

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.410 align:middle line:90%
to work with her.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:90%
You know, the word is out.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a great soul
catcher on the west coast.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the stories
that she comes home with

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely astounding.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I remember when my
books "Spirit Walker,"

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
"Medicine Maker," and "Vision
Seeker" came out years ago.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:90%
It was in the middle '90s.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in '96 or '97.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Jill was invited to speak at one
of the main HMO lecture series.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They have a seminar
series for visiting people

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to come and give talks
about their specialty work.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And they invited Jill to
actually talk down here

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.734 align:middle line:84%
in the cancer building
in downtown Sacramento.

00:38:14.734 --> 00:38:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
these evenings--

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.806 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a spirit catcher?

00:38:17.806 --> 00:38:19.305 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: On
soul retrieval work.

00:38:19.305 --> 00:38:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is fabulous.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.896 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: On her
soul retrieval work.

00:38:21.896 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was an evening in July,
it was about 105 in the shade.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.480 align:middle line:84%
There were-- the grasses
were burning somewhere,

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.938 align:middle line:84%
and the town was
filled with smoke.

00:38:29.938 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like a Wednesday
or Thursday night.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you wouldn't think that
a lot of people would show up.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It was like at 7
o'clock in the evening.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:84%
80 people showed up to
hear what she had to say.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And there were all
the white lab coats

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
in the audience, interested
in what she had to say.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about her
practice in soul retrieval,

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
work that she does.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of her
talk-- it was very well

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:84%
received-- somebody
approached her and said,

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
my name is Doctor so and so,
and I'm an anesthesiologist.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've been seeing these soul
parts leave all of my practice,

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and I've never
known what it was.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've never known
what to do about it.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And here's a man
with clairvoyance.

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to see
these globes of light

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.820 align:middle line:84%
actually leaving the person
who's in deep anesthesia.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're not returning.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.266 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
what to do, he

00:39:21.266 --> 00:39:22.682 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what
it was, he didn't

00:39:22.682 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:90%
know what to do about it.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.590 align:middle line:84%
The videotape that they made
of my wife's presentation,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, you can go to the
library and check these out.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Heavily checked out.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Heavily checked out.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, over the
next six months,

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:84%
that tape was constantly
being checked out and observed

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
by members of the
medical community.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So the medical community is
becoming aware of the trans

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:84%
personal aspects of
medicine, and the power.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, Larry Dossey, a
close personal friend,

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.907 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
this, and he's very

00:39:53.907 --> 00:39:56.490 align:middle line:84%
supportive of the work that Jill
does, and the work that I do.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Because he sees
precisely the direction

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.150 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to go in.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to really
expand the consciousness

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:90%
of the public at large.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:84%
That's part of why I wrote
this little book with Jill,

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.230 align:middle line:84%
called "Spirit Medicine," the
work we co-authored together.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of this stuff on these
classic levels of illness

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and the classic
levels of healing

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.655 align:middle line:90%
is laid out very, very nicely.

00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example of
how powerful this method is,

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.480 align:middle line:84%
there's an exercise that we
do in our workshops which

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:84%
involves having individuals find
their personal place of power

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:90%
and healing in the dream world.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.977 align:middle line:84%
We call it the sacred
garden, because you

00:40:34.977 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:90%
can do garden work there.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.830 align:middle line:84%
In a nutshell, I
ask people to find

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:84%
a memory of a place
where they've been,

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:90%
like Yosemite Valley, or Hawaii.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Someplace where they've been
where they were just blown away

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
by being there.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I ask them to
go into that memory,

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to go into the
memory of the place,

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.630 align:middle line:84%
to really perceive
themselves there.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like remembering
the experience.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:middle line:84%
We have dismember,
we have remember.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And once there, they discover
that the sacred garden,

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the place that they've chosen,
operates by four rules.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
garden is symbolic

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.135 align:middle line:84%
of some aspect of
themselves for their life.

00:41:13.135 --> 00:41:14.670 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the garden
can be communicated

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.290 align:middle line:90%
with for greater understanding.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:84%
That's like doing divination
work on your own behalf.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.840 align:middle line:90%
You can change the garden.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.575 align:middle line:90%
That's rule number three.

00:41:24.575 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a
waterfall in your garden,

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:90%
you can dream one up.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.830 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a
pond, the waters of peace

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and reconciliation,
you can create one

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:90%
with your creative imagination.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But the magic comes
with the fourth rule,

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:84%
because when you add or subtract
something from your garden,

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.444 align:middle line:84%
some aspect of you or your
life will change in response.

00:41:45.444 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:84%
That's because
everything in your garden

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.069 align:middle line:84%
is symbolic of some aspect
of you or your life.

00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:50.318 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a living dynamic.

00:41:50.318 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Takes you back
to the first principle.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Now many years ago, a woman
came to one of our workshops.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.440 align:middle line:84%
This was just a
one day workshop.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And when she went to her sacred
garden in a drumming journey,

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.620 align:middle line:84%
she comes back afterwards,
and she looks very disturbed.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.744 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how'd it go?

00:42:07.744 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at me, and
said, well, my garden

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:90%
was not as I remembered it.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:90%
She said, my garden is ordered.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It's trimmed.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like a little
English garden

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.090 align:middle line:84%
with little rose bushes
and a little cottage

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.230 align:middle line:90%
where I have tea.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It's my imaginal place.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I used to go there
when I was little girl,

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.785 align:middle line:84%
and I used to have adventures
with my friends, the chipmunks

00:42:25.785 --> 00:42:26.535 align:middle line:90%
and the squirrels.

00:42:26.535 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a perfect
shamanic experience,

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
which Western people go
into quite spontaneously.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.530 align:middle line:84%
She said, this time,
when I went to my garden,

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:84%
the vines were growing
all over everything.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They were strangling the trees,
growing all over the bushes.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The house was covered in vines,
and I could see them growing.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm getting
this download, right?

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.180 align:middle line:84%
From the folks
upstairs, so to speak.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And without even thinking
about it, I open my fat mouth,

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.685 align:middle line:90%
and I said, do you have cancer?

00:42:54.685 --> 00:42:58.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I just blurted out.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And she looks at me with shock.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:84%
10 days before,
she'd been diagnosed

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.590 align:middle line:84%
with metastatic cancer, a
particularly aggressive kind.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And she was in denial.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:90%
She was in the denial phase.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.180 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't even told her family.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:90%
And here it just, blurt.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.760 align:middle line:90%
It just comes out.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And she says, what
am I going to do?

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.677 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you've come
to the right place.

00:43:22.677 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, one thing
you have to understand

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.450 align:middle line:84%
about the shaman's
world is the shaman

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is not the one who
does the healing work.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the spirits who
work with the shaman.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Shamans never take credit
for the work that they do.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:84%
They always say,
oh, I didn't do it.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It's my helpers who
did it at my request.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I suggested that she
go back to her garden,

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to her little English
garden, and bring

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.740 align:middle line:90%
in a team of spirit helpers.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.216 align:middle line:90%
I suggested spirit gardeners.

00:43:47.216 --> 00:43:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, I said,
you could bring

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.520 align:middle line:84%
in a whole team of
Japanese gardeners.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen what Japanese
people do to bonsais?

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I do bonsai, and when I've
done the bonsai in the spring,

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:84%
my wife goes [GASP] like
this, because here, I've

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.160 align:middle line:84%
just trimmed them within
an inch of their lives.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, bring in a team
of spirit gardeners.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, she left, and
the minute she left,

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.420 align:middle line:90%
she went into healing.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
She made that step out of fear
into her own personal healing.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.900 align:middle line:84%
She worked with her
spirit gardeners

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:84%
for the whole rest
of the weekend.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the weekend,
she'd barely made a dent.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.110 align:middle line:84%
She came out every
drumming journey and said,

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:24.050 align:middle line:90%
they're still growing.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.990 align:middle line:90%
They're still growing.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:90%
They're still growing.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.015 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the weekend,
I got out my shamanic Rx pack.

00:44:29.015 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Journey work twice a day,
three times on Sunday.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Chop vines.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it was
before any of my little CDs

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
had come out with my books,
with drumming and rattling.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So I had her use a CD from
Michael Harner's foundation.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.270 align:middle line:90%
A CD of shamanic drumming.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.260 align:middle line:90%
She went to work, all right?

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Twice a day and three
times on Sunday.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And she went to her garden
with her spiritual helpers,

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.310 align:middle line:90%
and they chopped vines.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Three months later, I
get an email from her.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:84%
She finally tells me
every vine, every shoot,

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.050 align:middle line:90%
every sprig is gone.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Her spirit helpers have gotten
every vine out of her garden,

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:90%
and it's back to normal.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what happens next?

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.365 align:middle line:84%
She goes to her
oncologist and her cancer

00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:90%
has gone into remission.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:19.149 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I know,
it hasn't returned.

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't that
just incredible.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:22.981 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: You know, it's
an incredible little story,

00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's a true story.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And it reveals something that my
wife and I have seen repeatedly

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.370 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The real success
stories in healing

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
involve those
individuals who are

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.410 align:middle line:84%
willing to take an active role
in their own healing process.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Those individuals who are
willing to take responsibility

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.080 align:middle line:90%
for their own healing.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.700 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
success stories lie.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the shamanic
practitioner can work one

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:84%
on one with a client to
really help empower them,

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.736 align:middle line:84%
diagnose the problem,
extract the energetic aspect

00:45:52.736 --> 00:45:53.360 align:middle line:90%
of the illness.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what she was doing.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what she was doing.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then restore the
fabric of their soul

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.150 align:middle line:90%
to prevent reoccurrence.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And she eventually
did go through all

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
of these phases of her
healing, and as far as I know,

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.192 align:middle line:90%
she's still doing great.

00:46:08.192 --> 00:46:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a wonderful story,

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.524 align:middle line:84%
and that should be
uplifting to anybody who's

00:46:11.524 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:84%
dealing with cancer or any
other disharmonic condition

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.650 align:middle line:90%
or disease.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's-- before we wrap this
up, this is just fabulous,

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:23.330 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WESSELMAN: You're welcome.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always such
a pleasure meeting with you.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how we
work with each other.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.576 align:middle line:84%
How we work with
our children, how

00:46:29.576 --> 00:46:32.380 align:middle line:84%
we work in our intimate
relationships, and with family,

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.820 align:middle line:84%
coworkers, and friends to
keep each other empowered,

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.190 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't have
to live in this way

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to begin with, with disease.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Well, we're
living in an interesting time,

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.545 align:middle line:84%
in which there is a widespread
spiritual reawakening going on

00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:48.210 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now those of us who
are actively involved

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.855 align:middle line:84%
in this movement-- I think
of it as the transformational

00:46:53.855 --> 00:46:54.355 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:46:54.355 --> 00:46:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
who we are, Regina.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're making
these wonderful videos

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:00.810 align:middle line:84%
for the transformation
community,

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and essentially
creating a crossroad.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.000 align:middle line:84%
A visual and
informational crossroad

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.410 align:middle line:84%
in which people
can connect, expand

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
their conscious awareness,
expand their information base,

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:84%
expand their sense of who they
are, and what we're doing here,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.625 align:middle line:90%
and what this is all about.

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:19.306 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really about
the great mystery, isn't it?

00:47:19.306 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, where
did we come from?

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.760 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And where are we going?

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.990 align:middle line:84%
What is our destiny, our
purpose in being here?

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:28.940 align:middle line:84%
As we move into and
become who and what

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.990 align:middle line:84%
we're supposed to become,
it affects those people

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.082 align:middle line:90%
who are close to us.

00:47:33.082 --> 00:47:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just no way
it's not going to,

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.100 align:middle line:84%
because you're sitting
across from me,

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.700 align:middle line:84%
but you're sitting in
my energetic field.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dense
part of my field

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:84%
extends out about three
feet, and so does yours.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But it extends out
considerably further than that.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.962 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we're sitting
in an office, where we're

00:47:48.962 --> 00:47:50.920 align:middle line:84%
sitting watching television,
when we're sitting

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:84%
at dinner with our families,
when we're commuting to work

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:84%
with friends and
coworkers, they're

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:84%
going to be affected simply
by being in our field.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And the conversations-- I
have the most incredible

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.000 align:middle line:90%
conversations on airplanes.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe
that [LAUGHS]

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: You know, I will
sit down next to some man

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.070 align:middle line:84%
on an airplane, and
here's this guy.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Here I am dressed in
my corduroy jacket,

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I-- sort of my
Indiana Jones outfit.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.785 align:middle line:90%
Put my glasses--

00:48:19.785 --> 00:48:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going
to your next dig.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.223 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: --and I'm
looking academic, you know.

00:48:22.223 --> 00:48:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I sit down next to this guy
who's wearing a Gucci suit,

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and he's got a $2,000 watch,
and maybe $10,000, you know.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And if I can make contact
with him, all right?

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people don't
like to make contact,

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.020 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's
sort of jammed in,

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.050 align:middle line:84%
so everybody's in
everybody else's territory.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll say hi, Hank Wesselman.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:45.560 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, hi, [MUMBLES].

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.300 align:middle line:84%
If I can make contact with
them, usually the second thing

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.270 align:middle line:84%
we reveal about ourselves
is what we do for living.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.890 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So this man reveals
he's a doctor.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
He works in glass and
steel surroundings,

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.370 align:middle line:84%
he's one of the
gods in our society.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of physicians regard
themselves very highly,

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.930 align:middle line:90%
like deities, all right?

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me a little
bit about his work.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And then I tell him what I do.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:10.965 align:middle line:84%
I tell him I'm an
anthropologist,

00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and I go off to East Africa,
and I dig in the desert,

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.080 align:middle line:84%
finding the earliest
bones of our ancestors,

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.840 align:middle line:84%
working with tribal
people, working on Safari

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.865 align:middle line:84%
for months at a time
in a Safari camp.

00:49:21.865 --> 00:49:23.540 align:middle line:90%
[SNAP] I've got him.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I've got him.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are Indiana Jones.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.090 align:middle line:90%
No. [LAUGHS]

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: So,
what happens is then,

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I very carefully start
moving this towards the fact

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that I've met
traditional healers

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.220 align:middle line:90%
among the indigenous people.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell him
a couple of stories

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.340 align:middle line:90%
to see if he's interested.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, we're having

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.230 align:middle line:84%
a couple of Bloody
Marys together

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:90%
and we're becoming friends.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:47.897 align:middle line:84%
We're exchanging business
cards, and I'm affecting him.

00:49:47.897 --> 00:49:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm affecting him, and
he's going to take my card,

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.647 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to
see my website.

00:49:51.647 --> 00:49:53.105 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
go to my website,

00:49:53.105 --> 00:49:54.430 align:middle line:90%
and he's going to see my books.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:56.013 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
say, hmm, maybe I'll

00:49:56.013 --> 00:49:58.290 align:middle line:84%
read this book,
"Spirit Medicine."

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's a man on the
inside of the system.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.300 align:middle line:84%
A man in a position of
power inside the system.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Often, with my students at
the community colleges where

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I teach, I teach a class
called "Magic, Witchcraft

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and Religion," in
which I take the sons

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and daughters of our
esteemed citizens,

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and I completely
turn them inside out.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.097 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they
emerge from my class,

00:50:19.097 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:84%
they've got a completely
different view of who they are,

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.630 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing here,
and what this is all about.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.110 align:middle line:84%
They've experienced
authentic initiation.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.954 align:middle line:84%
Well, initiation
is very important,

00:50:27.954 --> 00:50:29.370 align:middle line:84%
because most of
these young people

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:32.040 align:middle line:84%
are coming out of adolescence,
they're going into adulthood,

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.211 align:middle line:90%
they're looking to be initiated.

00:50:34.211 --> 00:50:34.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And they respond to the
kind of man that I am.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.350 align:middle line:84%
The way in which
I present myself.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.180 align:middle line:90%
The way in which I dress.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.984 align:middle line:84%
They'll see some
little old African bead

00:50:43.984 --> 00:50:46.525 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing around my neck, and
they'll go, ooh, what's that?

00:50:46.525 --> 00:50:47.630 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:50.150 align:middle line:90%
I do that for their benefit.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.940 align:middle line:84%
When they come out of my
class, they're different.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.690 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I-- you know, they pay me
so little in these community

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:57.480 align:middle line:90%
colleges.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I've come to regard it
as my community service.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing it for
years, because I love doing it.

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.090 align:middle line:84%
This is another way in which
we change society at large.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So I just do it one
person at a time,

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.375 align:middle line:90%
or a workshop group at a time.

00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:14.000 align:middle line:84%
These people go home
to their families,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.708 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
what they experienced

00:51:15.708 --> 00:51:16.890 align:middle line:90%
in Dr. Hank's class.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Or in Hank Wesselman's workshop.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.537 align:middle line:84%
And their families are just
listening to these experiences,

00:51:23.537 --> 00:51:25.370 align:middle line:84%
or these things that
I've been telling them,

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:29.797 align:middle line:84%
and before you know it, they're
reading my little books.

00:51:29.797 --> 00:51:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Things are changing,
and they're happening--

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.750 align:middle line:84%
it's happening at
the grassroots level.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's where
I feel comfortable.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.890 align:middle line:90%
I also do conferences.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes speak for
1,000 people at a shot,

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.540 align:middle line:90%
sometimes 5,000 people.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer working
with small groups,

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because there's that
personal element.

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:84%
There's that connection
at the heart level

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.130 align:middle line:90%
that gets established.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is very, very
nourishing, very nurturing.

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking for
that in our society.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for that sense
of connection, community.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
beginning-- they

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:03.482 align:middle line:90%
can certainly feel the hole.

00:52:03.482 --> 00:52:05.190 align:middle line:84%
They can feel the
parts that are missing,

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:06.564 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
driving people

00:52:06.564 --> 00:52:09.350 align:middle line:84%
toward the need to
explore further.

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it requires a
certain amount of boldness,

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:12.510 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Often people have information,
they have innate abilities,

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.960 align:middle line:84%
they can see, for
example, and yet

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.820 align:middle line:84%
are afraid of being labeled
or being made fun of.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, often,
many people I know

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.050 align:middle line:84%
who are really very
talented in these ways,

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.820 align:middle line:84%
are afraid to speak up and
say what they can see and know

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.420 align:middle line:84%
with a stranger on an
airplane, for example, for fear

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
of being ridiculed or
rejected on some level.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.685 align:middle line:84%
So might boldness
be a part of this?

00:52:40.685 --> 00:52:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Yeah,
I used to work

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.810 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Colorado Museum,

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.130 align:middle line:90%
for a man named John Roener.

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.570 align:middle line:84%
He was a wonderful,
wonderful man.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:51.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a real-- he
was a medicine man.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.360 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in training
Native American people

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.699 align:middle line:84%
to go back to their communities
and create cultural centers.

00:52:56.699 --> 00:52:58.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what he was
doing while I was there.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:84%
He used to look at me,
and he used to say,

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Hank, the most important
thing is to have courage.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
makes all the difference.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.350 align:middle line:84%
When you have that courage
to make that first step

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and engage somebody, you're set.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:14.860 align:middle line:90%
You're off.

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.616 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:53:16.616 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all came
to be of service.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And part of my work
is helping people

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.100 align:middle line:90%
discover what their service is.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:90%
How they are to be of service.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.790 align:middle line:84%
How they can contribute
to the greater good.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:35.350 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous people, they have
a ritual comprehension almost,

00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:37.420 align:middle line:90%
of order and balance.

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that
every thought that we think,

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:84%
every word that we speak,
every action we take,

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:84%
every relationship we engage
in, every feeling that we feel,

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.890 align:middle line:84%
contributes either to the
greater good of the universe,

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.590 align:middle line:90%
or to its suffering.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And our job as human beings,
knowing this, you see,

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:59.020 align:middle line:84%
is to pursue goals
and life ways that

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.780 align:middle line:90%
contribute to the greater good.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.640 align:middle line:84%
That contribute to the beauty,
to the balance, to the order.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.150 align:middle line:84%
They also know
that every creature

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:09.090 align:middle line:84%
has tasks appropriate
to their being.

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And only when those tasks are
performed in the right way,

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, grizzly bears
grizzle, and woodpeckers

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.073 align:middle line:84%
do what they do, and the
penguins, we know what they do,

00:54:16.073 --> 00:54:18.120 align:middle line:84%
having seen "March
of the Penguins."

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Only when those
tasks are performed

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.870 align:middle line:84%
in the right way, only
then can the universe

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.640 align:middle line:84%
continue to function in
life-enhancing ways for all

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.530 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:30.950 align:middle line:84%
If any of us fail in our
tasks, everyone suffers.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So knowing this, I see
my contribution, really,

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and the contribution that I make
when I'm working with my wife,

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.860 align:middle line:90%
as trying to create balance.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Trying to create
harmony where we go

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.552 align:middle line:90%
and in the work that we do.

00:54:46.552 --> 00:54:47.510 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:51.695 align:middle line:90%


00:54:51.695 --> 00:54:52.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:54:52.625 --> 00:54:55.765 align:middle line:84%
>>WESSELMAN: Thank you
for having me. [CHUCKLES]

00:54:55.765 --> 00:54:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you haven't
already seen our first interview

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.820 align:middle line:84%
with Hank, I'd
suggest you watch it

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to have a greater understanding
of this wonderful man's

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:03.470 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're intrigued and
would like to dig deeper,

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:07.820 align:middle line:84%
you can click to buy
his trilogy of books,

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.200 align:middle line:84%
called "Spirit Walker,"
"Medicine Maker,"

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.470 align:middle line:90%
and "Vision Seeker."

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:22.667 align:middle line:90%
