1
00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:02.374
<v ->Before you begin watching this interview,</v>

2
00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:04.914
you'd be wise to pick up a pencil and paper because

3
00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:07.206
Burton Goldberg is going to be mentioning some

4
00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.805
names and websites you might find very useful

5
00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:11.931
in your search for alternative medicine.

6
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:13.368
As a little background,

7
00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:15.256
Burton was the founder and publisher of

8
00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.273
Alternative Medicine Magazine,

9
00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:18.840
which has since changed hands,

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.987
and is the author of one of the most comprehensive

11
00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:24.093
tones of alternative therapies in the world.

12
00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:27.765
It's titled "Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide."

13
00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.098
In fact, we had so much to talk about that this interview

14
00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:32.340
will be followed by part two next month.

15
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.737
We covered such subjects as the truth about

16
00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:38.640
Mad Cow's Disease and Alzheimers in the United States.

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.469
How nonholistic dental work is affecting your health,

18
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.685
and some startling news regarding cancer.

19
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.534
Just a little bit of background on how you ended up

20
00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:57.763
as the publisher and the founders correct?

21
00:00:57.763 --> 00:00:59.967
You were also the founder of Alternative Medicine Magazine?

22
00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:00.689
<v ->Yes.</v>

23
00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.256
<v Regina>Yes an incredible publication.</v>

24
00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.209
<v ->About 30 years ago,</v>

25
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.601
my friend's daughter, at the age of 19,

26
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.820
slit her wrist.

27
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.560
She was going to a psychiatrist

28
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.976
and frankly being talked to death.

29
00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.758
The psychiatrist, when she slit her wrist,

30
00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:21.702
said "I give up" and told the mother,

31
00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:25.654
"Did you ever hear of vitamin therapy?"

32
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.058
Well this was 30 years ago.

33
00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:29.722
They never heard of vitamin therapy

34
00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:33.381
and a friend of mine had a son in California

35
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.759
who was a physician who practiced alternative medicine,

36
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.851
of all things.

37
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.495
So we flew to California,

38
00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:44.313
and we discovered that this young girl was hypoglycemic.

39
00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:45.817
That means a blood trigger imbalance,

40
00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:49.859
and when treated with diet and nutrients,

41
00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.687
she got well from mental illness:

42
00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:54.201
Depression, anxiety.

43
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.203
<v Regina>Chronic depression.</v>

44
00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:57.540
<v ->Chronic depression.</v>

45
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.566
So I started looking into

46
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:06.120
heart disease and cancer,

47
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.946
arthritis and I found that there was a whole school

48
00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:11.710
that was being suppressed called Alternative Medicine

49
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.481
because they did things without drugs.

50
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.531
They did things naturally.

51
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.598
They went to the cause.

52
00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:21.468
We moved it, fed the body,

53
00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:24.124
and the body would heal itself.

54
00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:27.589
I went to school in Germany and this country

55
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.212
and conferences with doctors

56
00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:34.052
and learned some of the medical use talk

57
00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:39.423
and in 1990,

58
00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:41.925
I decided to do a book,

59
00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:45.489
putting all the entire school under one roof.

60
00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.493
And I did a book called "Alternative Medicine:

61
00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:49.942
"The Definitive Guide."

62
00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.152
It was 1,100 pages.

63
00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:54.477
<v Regina>I would just say an invariable tone.</v>

64
00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:57.569
It's one fat book.

65
00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.242
<v ->It took me four years.</v>

66
00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:01.873
I had 270 young staff.

67
00:03:01.873 --> 00:03:03.153
I'm not a writer,

68
00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:07.872
but I hire writers and have a smattering knowledge.

69
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.326
And one thing led to another.

70
00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:13.552
In those days when I did Multiple Sclerosis,

71
00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:17.318
I had to go to England for someone to write on it.

72
00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:20.188
And what we would do is we would have people do chapters

73
00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:23.090
and then we would rewrite them

74
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.286
and put them into one voice.

75
00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:29.006
So it took four years and $2 million to do this one book,

76
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.070
"Alternative Medicine: A Definitive Guide."

77
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.635
We've updated it in 2003.

78
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:40.156
It is now 1,250 pages with vastly more information because

79
00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:42.042
we took the margins out

80
00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.016
and we learned so much since.

81
00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:46.660
We became a center of information.

82
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.283
<v Regina>I was going to ask you too,</v>

83
00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:54.250
at that point you were going to Europe quite a bit.

84
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.417
And I remember 20, 21 years ago going to Europe

85
00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:00.447
myself with a camera crew

86
00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:03.891
and doing some pieces on alternative therapies

87
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:05.161
that were going on over there.

88
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.578
And they seem to be,

89
00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:08.958
is it that they were in advance of the United States

90
00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.092
on these technologies or just that they were operating

91
00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:13.186
more in the open?

92
00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:15.784
<v ->The answer is both.</v>

93
00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:18.301
Take Germany for instance.

94
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:23.166
Germany was destitute after the Second World War.

95
00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:27.528
They had a history of homeopathy, natural medication,

96
00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:29.950
and they had categories of physicians like

97
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.796
health practicioners, which are natural paths,

98
00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:38.514
and they didn't have the armament that we have

99
00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:41.722
in the pharmaceutical industrial complex to block it

100
00:04:41.722 --> 00:04:43.133
at that time.

101
00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.914
Of course now they do,

102
00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:47.632
but because they were destitute,

103
00:04:47.632 --> 00:04:50.790
they needed and didn't have very much money for drugs.

104
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.148
They worked the natural way.

105
00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.529
England, of course, has some very good laws

106
00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.961
allowing people to practice--

107
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.803
<v Regina>And the French do a lot of homeopathy</v>

108
00:05:00.803 --> 00:05:02.030
as well don't they?

109
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.730
<v ->Every apothecary drugstore</v>

110
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.972
must carry homeopathy,

111
00:05:08.972 --> 00:05:13.955
but the country is vigilant against alternative medicine

112
00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:15.823
as anywhere else.

113
00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:19.297
It's a money-thirsty situation that has to do with

114
00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:21.964
the pharmaceutical industrial complex.

115
00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:24.193
The manufacturers of pesticides and herbicides

116
00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:27.040
and hormones and so forth and the food supply

117
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.252
also are in the pharmaceutical business since,

118
00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:32.219
so they're all tied together.

119
00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:37.996
<v Regina>So let's focus then on Germany.</v>

120
00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:39.734
But out of necessity,

121
00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:43.542
really led the way in some senses in developing what became

122
00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.748
known today as alternative medicine.

123
00:05:45.748 --> 00:05:48.744
<v ->One of the great contributions that the Germans had</v>

124
00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:51.314
was a Doctor Voll, I think was a Nazi,

125
00:05:51.314 --> 00:05:54.288
had a device where he used

126
00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:57.163
quantum physics using residence,

127
00:05:57.163 --> 00:05:59.563
and he was able to tap into the body non-invasively

128
00:05:59.563 --> 00:06:04.563
using electric acupuncture

129
00:06:05.024 --> 00:06:09.925
system of checking the acupuncture points

130
00:06:09.925 --> 00:06:12.402
with a little trickle of electricity.

131
00:06:12.402 --> 00:06:12.955
<v Regina>Right.</v>

132
00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:14.992
<v ->And then reading a volt meter,</v>

133
00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:17.148
and he would know whether something was effective

134
00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:19.461
or couldn't be tolerated,

135
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:21.723
and whether it would do harm

136
00:06:21.723 --> 00:06:23.100
and he could titrate dosage,

137
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.106
give the proper amount to the patient.

138
00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:27.921
That was a great contribution.

139
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.702
The doctor's name was Voll.

140
00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:33.378
And then it took off into this country.

141
00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:35.885
In Salt Lake City, we had the Clark brothers who

142
00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:40.395
computerized it and put much of the substances

143
00:06:40.395 --> 00:06:44.458
that had to be tested so it could be organized quickly

144
00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:49.154
and adopted to help the physician locate

145
00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:50.339
what the poisons are.

146
00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:54.122
A very important story here is that there was a

147
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:59.122
man in a hospital in Utah who was dying.

148
00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:02.108
They knew he was poisoned.

149
00:07:02.578 --> 00:07:05.915
He was a farmer, and they roll this electrodermal

150
00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:09.149
screening device into the hospital room,

151
00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.336
checked him, and found there was a pesticide,

152
00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:15.004
one that this farmer had used frequently.

153
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.271
<v Regina>Without protection.</v>

154
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.900
<v ->Without protection.</v>

155
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.216
And so they made homeopathic doses of this

156
00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:23.188
and the farmer lived.

157
00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:26.068
And that's how I got into that particular area

158
00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:27.608
about 20 years ago.

159
00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:31.050
<v Regina>That's interesting that whole area using magnetic</v>

160
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.684
resonance fields to be able to not only diagnose

161
00:07:33.684 --> 00:07:35.072
but also treat.

162
00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:37.950
Where did Rife come in in all this mix with the--

163
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.777
<v ->Well Rife was way before Voll,</v>

164
00:07:40.777 --> 00:07:44.211
and he came up with some rife frequencies,

165
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.483
supposedly to implode cancer cells and so forth and so on.

166
00:07:50.952 --> 00:07:51.986
It was a great contribution,

167
00:07:51.986 --> 00:07:53.331
but it's all the same.

168
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:55.132
Energy is energy is energy.

169
00:07:55.132 --> 00:07:56.168
You can do it with light.

170
00:07:56.168 --> 00:07:57.203
You can do it with sound.

171
00:07:57.203 --> 00:07:59.016
You can do it with homeopathy

172
00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.946
and even drugs work on it.

173
00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:03.912
Of course drugs have tremendous side effects.

174
00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:05.597
<v Regina>Can we talk a little bit about that?</v>

175
00:08:05.597 --> 00:08:07.367
About the way we're structured today.

176
00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:09.970
Our standard HMO care, for example,

177
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.892
as you say also working alongside the

178
00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:16.555
pharmaceutical industrial complex.

179
00:08:16.934 --> 00:08:21.130
<v ->The number one killer in America today is doctors.</v>

180
00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:25.194
Iatrogenic medicine, doctor induced.

181
00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:27.651
There was a meta-study,

182
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:31.015
Gary Null and Carolyn Dean did called

183
00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:33.159
"Death by Modern Medicine."

184
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.077
It's a wonderful study,

185
00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:37.222
and you can probably get on the website of Carolyn Dean

186
00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:39.058
or Gary Null.

187
00:08:40.308 --> 00:08:42.704
In there they did a metastudy that's a group of many,

188
00:08:42.704 --> 00:08:45.220
many studies that showed that the number one killer

189
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.914
is in hospitals and nursing homes alone,

190
00:08:49.914 --> 00:08:54.388
784,000 deaths a year,

191
00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:57.633
from side effects of drugs

192
00:08:57.633 --> 00:08:59.094
secondary infections.

193
00:08:59.094 --> 00:09:02.229
You to go a hospital and you come in with an operation

194
00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:04.252
and you pick up a bug--
<v Regina>Right.</v>

195
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.040
<v ->In the hospital.</v>

196
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.399
Can you imagine going into the hospital with your shoes on.

197
00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.959
You can't go in to my friend's house with your shoes on.

198
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.389
<v Regina>Right.</v>

199
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:14.821
<v ->You have bed sores,</v>

200
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:19.478
and you have the side effects

201
00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:21.482
of drugs and doctor mistakes.

202
00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:22.282
<v Regina>Right.</v>

203
00:09:22.282 --> 00:09:25.543
<v ->784,000.</v>

204
00:09:25.543 --> 00:09:26.995
<v Regina>That would be an epidemic if it were--</v>

205
00:09:26.995 --> 00:09:30.549
<v ->It makes 9/11 pale.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

206
00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:34.791
<v ->Over 2,300 a day in hospitals</v>

207
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:38.082
and nursing homes alone.

208
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.652
So the side effects of drugs are way underreported.

209
00:09:42.652 --> 00:09:46.087
<v Regina>And how is this able, as I said a second ago,</v>

210
00:09:46.087 --> 00:09:47.698
this would be an epidemic.

211
00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:48.487
<v ->It is an epidemic.</v>

212
00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.105
<v Regina>If it were anything else,</v>

213
00:09:50.105 --> 00:09:52.504
it would be publicly called an epidemic.

214
00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:53.036
But it's not.

215
00:09:53.036 --> 00:09:54.130
In fact if you watch the news,

216
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.494
most of the advertising companies

217
00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.777
are pharmaceutical companies.

218
00:09:57.777 --> 00:10:01.308
<v ->And because of that, and because of the money involved,</v>

219
00:10:01.308 --> 00:10:03.345
the media will not report.

220
00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:07.004
And that's why it's not known to the public as an epidemic.

221
00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:10.053
But the bottom line here is that we are being

222
00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:12.251
poisoned to death.

223
00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:13.644
Our society.

224
00:10:13.644 --> 00:10:16.024
We're destroying the planet.

225
00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:17.386
Not only in our global warming,

226
00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:20.211
but we have going through the sky,

227
00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:23.610
all kinds of pesticides and herbacides and poisons

228
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.405
coming from one continent to another by the winds.

229
00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:29.411
We're being poisioned to death.

230
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:33.629
We're being starved to death in a land of plenty.

231
00:10:33.849 --> 00:10:36.302
Our food supply is denuded.

232
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.701
Our food supply is adulterated,

233
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:43.237
and our food supply doesn't have the energy.

234
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.730
And that's why it's so very important to have

235
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.281
organically grown vegetabels and fruits,

236
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:54.153
and hormone, pesticide-free,

237
00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.965
antibiotic-free beef,

238
00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:58.802
chicken, and so forth.
<v Regina>Eggs, dairy, almond.</v>

239
00:10:58.802 --> 00:11:00.474
<v ->It's a range-grown.</v>

240
00:11:00.474 --> 00:11:03.690
And when you feed animals grain,

241
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.653
you miss the amino acids because

242
00:11:05.653 --> 00:11:09.642
there are hardly any amino acids in the grain.

243
00:11:09.642 --> 00:11:10.276
<v Regina>Right.</v>

244
00:11:10.276 --> 00:11:13.734
<v ->So when they fed on grass,</v>

245
00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:17.091
they imbibe these

246
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:19.451
and they go into the animal's feed

247
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:20.183
and as we consume--

248
00:11:20.183 --> 00:11:21.516
<v Regina>And the phytonutrients.</v>

249
00:11:21.516 --> 00:11:22.761
<v ->They go into us.</v>

250
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:26.688
So it's very, very important that we learn

251
00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:28.742
how to eat.

252
00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:30.054
Drinking water.

253
00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:32.295
Our water supply is poisoned,

254
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:35.846
We get eight times more toxins in the bath

255
00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:38.939
and shower water than we do in drinking,

256
00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:42.427
so it's not only important to drink bottled water,

257
00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:45.541
which is in plastic bottles that generally depart

258
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:50.102
some kind of toxin,

259
00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:54.320
but we should filter our shower and bath water.

260
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.898
Matter of fact, if you can afford it to have

261
00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:58.788
the entire house filtered because

262
00:11:58.788 --> 00:12:01.551
the warm water opens up the skin

263
00:12:01.551 --> 00:12:03.480
and these toxins come in.

264
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.361
<v Regina>Very good point.</v>

265
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:05.945
That's not something you often hear.

266
00:12:05.945 --> 00:12:07.450
<v ->Most people don't talk about it.</v>

267
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.274
Our toothpaste has fluoride.

268
00:12:10.274 --> 00:12:12.837
Fluoride kills selenium.

269
00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:15.469
Selenium is very, very important for us.

270
00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.018
Our normal dose of selenium,

271
00:12:17.018 --> 00:12:20.515
we should have as much as 800 micrograms a day

272
00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:24.856
and most of the charts say don't do more than 200

273
00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:26.264
micrograms a day.

274
00:12:26.264 --> 00:12:29.165
I was in a cancer hospital in Germany

275
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.076
and I watched patients get 5,000 micrograms

276
00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:33.167
every other day.

277
00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.935
As much as 7,000.

278
00:12:34.935 --> 00:12:37.474
So if you have cold's and flu's

279
00:12:37.474 --> 00:12:39.875
and your immune system is impaired,

280
00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:42.208
do selenium.

281
00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:45.004
<v Regina>Don't drink fluoridated water.</v>

282
00:12:45.004 --> 00:12:46.892
<v ->Don't do fluorinated water. No.</v>

283
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.301
I don't drink tap water.

284
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:49.260
<v Regina>Right.</v>

285
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.140
<v ->And I have my shower filtered.</v>

286
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.626
I have a shower filter, probably a foot long,

287
00:12:54.626 --> 00:12:58.489
and I change it every year.

288
00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:01.888
<v Regina>So we have, because cancer is something you</v>

289
00:13:01.888 --> 00:13:04.501
spend so much time studying,

290
00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:06.837
and just an incredible work on.

291
00:13:06.837 --> 00:13:07.755
You have a DVD out,

292
00:13:07.755 --> 00:13:08.850
which we'll let people know about

293
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.512
at the end of the interview,

294
00:13:10.512 --> 00:13:13.319
let's start with what normally happens when a person

295
00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:17.427
in this country finds out they have cancer.

296
00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:19.333
What is the normal treatment?

297
00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:21.584
<v ->Cancer is an epidemic.</v>

298
00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:23.421
In my opinion, it's not a question of

299
00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:25.531
"Will I have cancer?",

300
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:27.546
it's a question of "When?".

301
00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:30.309
<v Regina>We're talking the number two besides you said--</v>

302
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:33.883
<v ->Cancer is the number two killer today.</v>

303
00:13:33.883 --> 00:13:34.788
<v Regina>Above heart disease?</v>

304
00:13:34.788 --> 00:13:38.874
<v ->Back in 2004, it advanced the number</v>

305
00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:41.434
one killer of disease.

306
00:13:41.434 --> 00:13:45.230
But the number one killer are doctors and hospitals

307
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.649
and nursing homes.

308
00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:47.907
Number two is cancer.

309
00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:49.858
Number three is heart disease now.

310
00:13:49.858 --> 00:13:53.556
<v Regina>Well this number has spiked tremendously from say</v>

311
00:13:53.556 --> 00:13:55.113
when you were born.

312
00:13:55.113 --> 00:13:56.692
What were the stats back then?

313
00:13:56.692 --> 00:13:59.379
<v ->I was born in 1926.</v>

314
00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:04.229
In 1926, cancer was a tenth cause of death in children.

315
00:14:04.229 --> 00:14:08.453
Today, it's the second cause of death

316
00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:10.917
in children behind accidents.

317
00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:15.040
When my daddy was born in 1900,

318
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.040
one in 33 Americans had cancer of any kind, shape, or form.

319
00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:24.024
Today, it's every other man and any other woman

320
00:14:24.024 --> 00:14:27.618
and those are 1999 numbers from the American Cancer Society.

321
00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:29.590
Every other man and woman will have

322
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.978
cancer in their lifetime,

323
00:14:30.978 --> 00:14:34.398
and I think those are low.

324
00:14:34.398 --> 00:14:35.324
<v Regina>Conservative numbers?</v>

325
00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:36.659
Why would they be conservative?

326
00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:37.662
I mean--

327
00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:39.644
<v ->Well because they're 1999 numbers.</v>

328
00:14:39.644 --> 00:14:41.212
That's the last numbers I had,

329
00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:43.687
and we're now six years behind.

330
00:14:43.687 --> 00:14:46.151
So five years behind.

331
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:52.369
Cancer is epidemic.

332
00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:57.329
One in 33 in the turn of the century 1900 had cancer.

333
00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:58.853
Today it's every other person.

334
00:14:58.853 --> 00:14:59.952
<v Regina>One in two.</v>

335
00:14:59.952 --> 00:15:02.181
<v ->So it's astounding and nobody talks about it.</v>

336
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:04.155
So we know what causes cancer.

337
00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:06.629
When you ask conventional doctors what causes cancer,

338
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:09.478
they say, "Well the Sun, and cigarette smoking,

339
00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:11.249
"and then we don't know."

340
00:15:11.249 --> 00:15:12.442
And that's the problem.

341
00:15:12.442 --> 00:15:13.402
<v Regina>That's a short list.</v>

342
00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:14.732
<v ->They don't know.</v>

343
00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:19.081
They don't want to know because we know it's pesticides,

344
00:15:19.081 --> 00:15:24.081
herbicides, heavy metals, mental, dental.

345
00:15:24.671 --> 00:15:27.084
Dentistry plays an enormous role.

346
00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:31.987
As much as 50% in the reversal of cancer is in the mouth.

347
00:15:31.987 --> 00:15:36.233
And 95% of females with breast cancer

348
00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:38.602
have a dental involvement.

349
00:15:38.602 --> 00:15:41.107
That's a study from a German university.

350
00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Regina>Seriously?</v>

351
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.771
<v ->It's all in my DVD.</v>

352
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:45.822
<v Regina>Can you talk about that a little bit now though?</v>

353
00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:47.134
That's pretty startling numbers.

354
00:15:47.134 --> 00:15:49.460
<v ->Here's how the dentistry works.</v>

355
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.784
Every tooth in your body is connected to organs and systems.

356
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.988
So if you have a prostate problem or a gallbladder problem,

357
00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:58.781
it might be a tooth.

358
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:03.185
And one of the best ways of discerning is having this

359
00:16:03.185 --> 00:16:05.905
electrodermal screening device using quantum physics

360
00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:07.878
to tap into the body

361
00:16:09.798 --> 00:16:13.413
and see what the cause is.

362
00:16:13.413 --> 00:16:15.298
I'll never forget I had a cancer clinic

363
00:16:15.298 --> 00:16:20.298
years ago in Scottsdale, Arizona,

364
00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:24.379
and we had a man with excruciating pain

365
00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:27.210
in his prostate from cancer.

366
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.840
And it was the tooth,

367
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.174
according to the electrodermal screening.

368
00:16:30.174 --> 00:16:32.392
It could be the tooth or it could be the prostate

369
00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:33.832
causing the tooth or it could be the tooth

370
00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:35.580
causing the prostate.

371
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.525
And he was told to remove that tooth.

372
00:16:38.525 --> 00:16:40.498
He went to a biologic dentist

373
00:16:40.498 --> 00:16:42.630
and that's the only kind of dentist one should use,

374
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.853
a biologic that doesn't use mercury,

375
00:16:44.853 --> 00:16:48.515
and understands the relationship between

376
00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:51.364
organs and systems and each individual tooth.

377
00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:53.517
The instant his tooth was removed,

378
00:16:53.517 --> 00:16:56.078
his excruciating pain disappeared.

379
00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:58.279
<v Regina>And this is replicated over and over</v>

380
00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.397
these same results?

381
00:16:59.397 --> 00:17:04.397
<v ->My mentor is Vernor Scheidel, priest who lives in Germany,</v>

382
00:17:05.422 --> 00:17:08.450
Scheidel was born in Germany.

383
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.123
During the Nazis, he spoke badly about the Nazis

384
00:17:13.123 --> 00:17:15.660
in front of his housekeeper.

385
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.720
She reported him, he was arrested

386
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.971
and put into a garden camp,

387
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:22.221
he escaped over the fence,

388
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:24.313
and ended up in Portugal.

389
00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:27.747
First ship was going to Argentina where he ended up

390
00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:31.024
and finished his priesthood in seminary school.

391
00:17:31.024 --> 00:17:32.834
And in those days in Argentina,

392
00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:35.063
in order to have people go to church,

393
00:17:35.063 --> 00:17:36.183
you did two things:

394
00:17:36.183 --> 00:17:38.844
You did medicine or movies.

395
00:17:38.844 --> 00:17:42.076
So being a German, knowing little about homeopathy,

396
00:17:42.076 --> 00:17:44.507
and he studied homeopathy because

397
00:17:44.507 --> 00:17:45.809
it was inexpensive.

398
00:17:45.809 --> 00:17:48.410
They had no money and it's so inexpensive to do.

399
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.014
You know it's number one method

400
00:17:52.014 --> 00:17:54.167
of healing in India

401
00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:56.866
of all places, besides the Ayurvedic.

402
00:17:56.866 --> 00:17:59.542
They use homeopathy enormously.

403
00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:01.591
And then after the war, he went to the Max Planck Institute

404
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:05.025
in Heidelberg, Germany and studied with the giants.

405
00:18:05.025 --> 00:18:07.179
So he's my mentor.

406
00:18:07.179 --> 00:18:11.499
And he says as much as 50% in the reversal of cancer

407
00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:13.516
is in the mouth.

408
00:18:13.516 --> 00:18:17.698
Root canals, electrolytic action

409
00:18:17.698 --> 00:18:19.896
between metals,

410
00:18:19.896 --> 00:18:22.905
roofers and plumbers spend more time on the relationship

411
00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:27.415
to metals and boat builders than dentists.

412
00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:31.926
You have mercury, which is silver fillings.

413
00:18:31.926 --> 00:18:34.486
Over 50% is mercury.

414
00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:35.584
<v Regina>Right.</v>

415
00:18:35.584 --> 00:18:37.633
<v ->It leeches 24/7.</v>

416
00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:39.766
And then you have gold

417
00:18:39.766 --> 00:18:41.377
and there's electrolytic action,

418
00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:44.301
just like you have in boats.

419
00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.859
So dentistry plays a role.

420
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:47.552
And in Germany,

421
00:18:47.552 --> 00:18:50.027
there's a medical school that did a study,

422
00:18:50.027 --> 00:18:53.099
and they found that 95% of females with breast cancer

423
00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.965
have a dental involvement.

424
00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:57.396
The mercury not only leeches out of the mouth

425
00:18:57.396 --> 00:18:58.927
and go in all throughout the body,

426
00:18:58.927 --> 00:19:01.409
but goes into the ganglia, particularly in the breast.

427
00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:02.730
And through the ganglia,

428
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.416
which is a roundhouse of energy,

429
00:19:04.416 --> 00:19:06.934
comes a blood supply and the Meridian system

430
00:19:06.934 --> 00:19:08.520
for the various organs.

431
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.892
And it gets insulted by the mercury and tightens,

432
00:19:11.892 --> 00:19:14.614
and then you can't have a flow of lymphocytes,

433
00:19:14.614 --> 00:19:17.503
and the garber removal from the breast.

434
00:19:17.503 --> 00:19:20.565
And that's why we have so much breast cancer.

435
00:19:20.565 --> 00:19:23.742
Plus the pesticides and the herbicides and so forth.

436
00:19:23.742 --> 00:19:26.647
So when you do split biopsies,

437
00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:30.483
half to pathology is cancerous,

438
00:19:30.483 --> 00:19:33.608
and the other half to toxicology inside the tumor,

439
00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:38.205
they find arsenic, chloridine, and DDT, and PCB's.

440
00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:40.950
Now I live in Marin County, California,

441
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.261
which is the highest breast cancer rate

442
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:46.515
and one of the highest prostate cancer rates in America.

443
00:19:46.515 --> 00:19:48.806
And I've been on the board of the group of

444
00:19:48.806 --> 00:19:50.962
trying to find out the causation of cancer.

445
00:19:50.962 --> 00:19:54.130
And when I say "Let's go to their hospitals,

446
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.873
"take the tissue that's removed in biopsies,

447
00:19:57.873 --> 00:20:00.481
"Send them to toxicology to find out

448
00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:05.258
"what is inside the tumor," they don't wanna do it.

449
00:20:05.258 --> 00:20:09.121
So conventional medicine seems not want to get

450
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:11.370
involved in the causation.

451
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.960
And until you do,

452
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.148
you're gonna have this Holocaust.

453
00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:20.085
<v Regina>We can understand there might be</v>

454
00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.359
some motivation there.

455
00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:26.359
There's a lot of money in cancer for the medical industry,

456
00:20:26.437 --> 00:20:27.758
I assume.

457
00:20:27.758 --> 00:20:29.498
There's a fair amount of subsidy.

458
00:20:31.818 --> 00:20:33.622
<v ->On my website,</v>

459
00:20:33.622 --> 00:20:35.796
if you wanna see the truth about the

460
00:20:35.796 --> 00:20:39.390
National Cancer Institute not wanting to cure cancer,

461
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.342
on my website burton goldberg dot com,

462
00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:44.222
you go to my congressional testimony before the

463
00:20:44.222 --> 00:20:46.888
Burton Committee into the year 2000.

464
00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:50.334
And I tell the story about hydrazine sulfate.

465
00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:55.334
A Doctor Joe Gold in Syracuse, New York gave to humanity

466
00:20:55.581 --> 00:20:57.000
this invention of his.

467
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.400
Hydrazine sulfate is rocket fuel.

468
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.261
It costs pennies a day to buy orally

469
00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:07.506
and has helped many, many people who have

470
00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:15.526
to catch the form of wasting away in AIDS and in cancer.

471
00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:18.697
And what happens is the cancer produces lactic acid.

472
00:21:18.697 --> 00:21:20.051
It goes through the liver.

473
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:22.857
Lactic acid is like a turbo charge for the cancer.

474
00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:27.709
And hydrazine sulfate stops that particular action.

475
00:21:27.709 --> 00:21:31.821
And there are people who really got well.

476
00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:35.922
Sloan Kettering was assigned to do a task

477
00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:38.896
and Doctor Joe Gold said to Sloan Kettering,

478
00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:40.625
"You've got to be very careful that you don't give

479
00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:44.549
"too much or too little so many grams

480
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:47.226
"per killogram of body weight.

481
00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:51.018
"There are no sleeping pills

482
00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.536
"or amphetamines

483
00:21:53.536 --> 00:21:57.983
"or alcohol because they negate its efficacy.

484
00:21:57.983 --> 00:21:59.029
"And if you do this,

485
00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:02.089
"you'll have good success that we've had at

486
00:22:02.089 --> 00:22:07.089
"Harbor Hospital, UCLA, and Petrov Institute in Russia

487
00:22:07.273 --> 00:22:12.253
"where we had a 50% efficacy for pennies a day

488
00:22:12.253 --> 00:22:16.394
"with hundreds of patients."

489
00:22:16.394 --> 00:22:20.200
Sloan Kettering scuddled the test.

490
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.359
They forbid the use of these sleeping pills,

491
00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:27.890
amphetamines, and alcohol and so forth,

492
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.061
and they overdosed their patients

493
00:22:32.061 --> 00:22:35.496
and consequently these people passed on.

494
00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:36.770
<v Regina>Were they overdosed with a</v>

495
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.023
hydrogen sulfate you're saying?

496
00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:41.501
<v ->Correct. They overdosed them with hydrogen sulfate.</v>

497
00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:44.508
Now all this story has been checked by the

498
00:22:44.508 --> 00:22:47.495
General Accounting Office of the U.S. government.

499
00:22:47.495 --> 00:22:49.790
And when the report was ready to go out,

500
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.774
the man who did the report, Barry Tice,

501
00:22:52.774 --> 00:22:55.900
retired after 30 years.

502
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.963
And for the first time in his career of 30 years

503
00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:02.544
between the American Cancer Society

504
00:23:02.544 --> 00:23:04.253
and the General Accounting Office,

505
00:23:04.253 --> 00:23:09.253
they modified his report to turn it into

506
00:23:09.307 --> 00:23:14.307
that they did no harm when actually these people--

507
00:23:15.651 --> 00:23:17.349
<v Regina>Falsified the documents.</v>

508
00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:20.422
<v ->Because the tests were done incorrectly.</v>

509
00:23:20.422 --> 00:23:24.016
They wanted to prove it wrong.

510
00:23:24.016 --> 00:23:26.896
Now this study was done at Penthouse Magazine

511
00:23:26.896 --> 00:23:29.234
many years ago because

512
00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:34.742
Guccione and a guy by the name of Doctor Albert Freeman

513
00:23:34.742 --> 00:23:38.200
who worked with him, was very much into cancer.

514
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.409
And it cost them thousands of dollars in advertising

515
00:23:41.409 --> 00:23:43.095
because the car ads pulled out because

516
00:23:43.095 --> 00:23:47.478
the agency's representing the pharmaceutical industry.

517
00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:49.537
And they punished him financially.

518
00:23:49.537 --> 00:23:54.272
But the story got out and Sloan Kettering never sued

519
00:23:54.272 --> 00:23:57.121
Penthouse magazine for the story telling how the

520
00:23:57.121 --> 00:24:00.353
General Accounting Office caught them red-handed.

521
00:24:02.223 --> 00:24:04.937
<v Regina>So what is at the backbone of this?</v>

522
00:24:04.937 --> 00:24:08.141
One would have to begin looking at it as a conspiracy

523
00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:10.143
of sorts to keep people ill.

524
00:24:10.143 --> 00:24:12.298
What is at the backbone of this?

525
00:24:12.298 --> 00:24:13.962
<v ->Exactly what you just said.</v>

526
00:24:13.962 --> 00:24:18.789
It's a conspiracy not to cure cancer, period.

527
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.543
They don't wnat to cure it.

528
00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:22.602
Anytime anything comes up that's natural,

529
00:24:22.602 --> 00:24:25.386
they'll shut it down.

530
00:24:25.386 --> 00:24:27.613
In the state of California,

531
00:24:27.613 --> 00:24:29.930
the only way you can treat cancer is with chemotherapy,

532
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.351
radiation, and surgery.

533
00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:36.457
Now early stage cancer is easily reversed

534
00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:39.400
with natural substances.

535
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.365
Later state cancer, you might very well

536
00:24:42.365 --> 00:24:45.171
have to use chemotherapy.

537
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:48.297
When I did my first book on cancer, it's 1,100-page book,

538
00:24:48.297 --> 00:24:50.834
"Alternative Medicine: A Definitive Guide",

539
00:24:50.834 --> 00:24:53.619
it sold something like 100,000 copies.

540
00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:56.915
It was a $50 book at 37 doctors.

541
00:24:56.915 --> 00:24:59.452
I did not believe in chemotherapy

542
00:24:59.452 --> 00:25:02.109
and the way chemotherapy is practiced today,

543
00:25:02.109 --> 00:25:05.042
I don't believe because it's done blindly.

544
00:25:05.042 --> 00:25:06.760
<v Regina>Kind of like throwing spaghetti against the wall</v>

545
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.800
and see what sticks?

546
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.181
<v ->Exactly. They are blindly</v>

547
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:13.750
giving you chemotherapy.

548
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.917
Now here's the story with chemotherapy.

549
00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:19.927
There's a laboratory in Germany,

550
00:25:19.927 --> 00:25:23.539
the only one in the world that works on the patient's

551
00:25:23.539 --> 00:25:28.539
blood to find out what will work on the primary tumor

552
00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:32.117
and more important,

553
00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:37.013
what will work on the disseminated micromestastasis cells

554
00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:40.265
because what works on the primary tumor

555
00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:44.671
will not work on the disseminated micrometastasis.

556
00:25:44.671 --> 00:25:48.301
It's easy to shrink the tumor,

557
00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:51.456
to remove it,

558
00:25:51.456 --> 00:25:54.424
but it goes through the blood supply with a knife.

559
00:25:54.424 --> 00:25:56.980
It goes through the blood supply even if you don't

560
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.355
use a knife.

561
00:25:58.355 --> 00:26:00.978
All tumors shed,

562
00:26:00.978 --> 00:26:04.331
and my mentor here was Albert Scheller,

563
00:26:04.331 --> 00:26:06.631
a wonderful physician who I felt was one of the

564
00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:08.137
finest physicians in the world.

565
00:26:08.137 --> 00:26:10.148
I did a film on him

566
00:26:10.148 --> 00:26:15.148
back in 2004.

567
00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:19.182
He taught me that,

568
00:26:19.182 --> 00:26:22.884
and he had worked with this laboratory doing a test

569
00:26:22.884 --> 00:26:26.669
that will tell you which chemo will work on your tumor

570
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:28.378
so you're not doing it blindly.

571
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:28.846
<v Regina>Right.</v>

572
00:26:28.846 --> 00:26:32.134
<v ->And then one can use low-dose chemotherapy</v>

573
00:26:32.134 --> 00:26:35.505
with hypothermia or insulin-potentiated where they put

574
00:26:35.505 --> 00:26:39.099
a little sugar in that is attracted to the cancer 'cause

575
00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:41.338
cancer loves sugar.

576
00:26:43.378 --> 00:26:48.378
I saw a story in the U.S. News Report

577
00:26:49.435 --> 00:26:50.544
newspaper the other day.

578
00:26:50.544 --> 00:26:53.550
I was down in Virginia,

579
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.313
and the question was,

580
00:26:56.313 --> 00:26:59.076
"Does sugar affect cancer?"

581
00:26:59.076 --> 00:27:00.782
And the American Cancer Society says,

582
00:27:00.782 --> 00:27:02.659
"No. There's no known reason."

583
00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:04.322
And yet when you do a PET scan,

584
00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:07.225
if they want that radiation to go into the tumor,

585
00:27:07.225 --> 00:27:08.386
they put sugar in it.

586
00:27:08.386 --> 00:27:09.604
<v Regina>Sugar. You'd think they--</v>

587
00:27:09.604 --> 00:27:11.331
<v ->You think they would know.</v>

588
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:15.762
But the American Cancer Society.

589
00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:17.499
<v Regina>So basically the sugar pacifies</v>

590
00:27:17.499 --> 00:27:19.708
or attracts the cancer cells or feeds it.

591
00:27:19.708 --> 00:27:20.078
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

592
00:27:20.078 --> 00:27:22.595
The cancer industry is like Alice in Wonderland going

593
00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:24.099
through the looking glass.

594
00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:26.456
It is totally corrupt.

595
00:27:26.456 --> 00:27:30.586
Now, the man in Germany who developed this test,

596
00:27:30.586 --> 00:27:31.926
or this laboratory,

597
00:27:31.926 --> 00:27:34.951
and incidentally the website for them is

598
00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:39.461
www dot B-I-O-F-O-C-U-S

599
00:27:39.477 --> 00:27:42.956
dot de, deutschland.

600
00:27:45.006 --> 00:27:46.847
They're the only ones in the world that do it,

601
00:27:46.847 --> 00:27:48.873
and you click on the English flag,

602
00:27:48.873 --> 00:27:50.039
or the American flag,

603
00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:52.041
and you'll have it in english.

604
00:27:52.041 --> 00:27:56.884
And there, instead of having an 80% failure

605
00:27:56.884 --> 00:28:00.523
because in the case of chemotherapy,

606
00:28:00.523 --> 00:28:03.680
80% of chemotherapy fails.

607
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.749
Only 20% is effective.

608
00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:07.069
These are medical studies.

609
00:28:07.069 --> 00:28:09.951
And of the 80%,

610
00:28:09.951 --> 00:28:12.372
60% does harm.

611
00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:17.108
And that's why this test, you'll reverse it.

612
00:28:17.108 --> 00:28:21.152
You have an 82% success rate with chemo

613
00:28:21.152 --> 00:28:24.584
by knowing exactly what will do the micrometastasis

614
00:28:24.584 --> 00:28:27.977
because it goes to the lung, liver, the spleen,

615
00:28:27.977 --> 00:28:31.455
the breast, the brains.

616
00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:36.935
It's very, very important to know that the biofocus

617
00:28:36.935 --> 00:28:38.824
test is available.

618
00:28:38.824 --> 00:28:39.998
<v Regina>Yes, and we're in fact,</v>

619
00:28:39.998 --> 00:28:42.279
a little later we're going to talk about a number

620
00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:45.853
of modalities that people can look toward.

621
00:28:45.853 --> 00:28:47.847
And if we can continue along,

622
00:28:47.847 --> 00:28:50.588
you were saying that this industry is corrupt.

623
00:28:50.588 --> 00:28:52.476
There has to be a motivation.

624
00:28:52.476 --> 00:28:54.738
Generally, it means follow the money.

625
00:28:54.738 --> 00:28:58.236
There must be a profitable industry, the cancer industry.

626
00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.369
Is that correct?

627
00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:01.851
<v ->Of course.</v>

628
00:29:01.851 --> 00:29:04.145
<v Regina>So can you talk a little bit toward that?</v>

629
00:29:04.145 --> 00:29:07.931
<v ->We all know that chemotherapy is highly expensive,</v>

630
00:29:07.931 --> 00:29:12.931
and they don't want anything to interrupt this practice

631
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.302
of using chemotherapy.

632
00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:19.141
<v Regina>But couldn't they use chemo wisely?</v>

633
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:20.550
Still get their money?

634
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.632
<v ->They could use it wisely, but they don't want to.</v>

635
00:29:23.632 --> 00:29:28.366
The National Cancer Institute was offered to do studies

636
00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:32.836
on this test for no money to get the same incredible results

637
00:29:32.836 --> 00:29:34.541
that these clinics,

638
00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:39.160
who go to and use this biofocus blood test,

639
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.201
and yet they haven't done it.

640
00:29:42.201 --> 00:29:45.470
There's no desire to make a change.

641
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.798
They want to keep it just the way it is.

642
00:29:50.758 --> 00:29:51.530
<v Regina>With that said,</v>

643
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.935
so you're not seeing that there's going to be

644
00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:56.655
any large breakthrough anytime soon on the--

645
00:29:56.655 --> 00:29:58.158
<v ->Well there is a large breakthrough,</v>

646
00:29:58.158 --> 00:30:00.357
but they don't want it.

647
00:30:00.357 --> 00:30:01.432
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->But they don't go near it.</v>

648
00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:04.557
<v Regina>But if you go to an HMO with cancer,</v>

649
00:30:04.557 --> 00:30:06.265
you're an average citizen.

650
00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:08.909
An HMO will extend this.

651
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:10.415
We have audiences all around the world.

652
00:30:10.415 --> 00:30:14.425
If you go to a standard medical institution for your cancer,

653
00:30:14.425 --> 00:30:15.862
what is your treatment going to look like

654
00:30:15.862 --> 00:30:18.937
and what are the stats on it?

655
00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:23.288
<v ->Here's the problem.</v>

656
00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:26.518
They consider cancer cured after five years.

657
00:30:26.518 --> 00:30:29.105
What happens after five years in two months

658
00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:32.561
or three days,

659
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:35.795
every tumor sheds,

660
00:30:35.795 --> 00:30:36.795
and sooner or later,

661
00:30:36.795 --> 00:30:40.776
it comes back with vengeance almost always.

662
00:30:40.776 --> 00:30:44.431
And that's why this blood test is so very, very important.

663
00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:45.916
To nip it in the bud.

664
00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:49.298
One can see where it is, how virulent it is,

665
00:30:49.298 --> 00:30:51.580
and what substances to use.

666
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.705
And these are all conventional substances.

667
00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:57.693
So yes, they could do it,

668
00:30:57.693 --> 00:30:58.971
but they don't.

669
00:30:58.971 --> 00:31:01.275
And when I mentioned this--

670
00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:02.266
<v Regina>Does that mean because they're going to</v>

671
00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:04.464
get repeat business in another three to five,

672
00:31:04.464 --> 00:31:06.310
seven years or what?

673
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:11.310
<v ->To do alternative, I call it integrative medicine</v>

674
00:31:11.462 --> 00:31:13.663
using the best of both worlds,

675
00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:17.931
again early stage cancers does not need to use

676
00:31:17.931 --> 00:31:22.622
these chemotherapies and radiation.

677
00:31:22.622 --> 00:31:24.734
Radiation, I think, is absolutely horrible.

678
00:31:24.734 --> 00:31:27.890
There are times when you need it to shrink lung cancers

679
00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.251
or something or shrink a brain to keep somebody alive,

680
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:33.682
but it does horrible damage.

681
00:31:33.682 --> 00:31:36.765
It's astoundingly bad.

682
00:31:36.765 --> 00:31:39.005
And it comes back with vengeance.

683
00:31:39.005 --> 00:31:41.425
<v Regina>How often, in early stage cancer,</v>

684
00:31:41.425 --> 00:31:44.456
are these modalities used?

685
00:31:44.456 --> 00:31:46.813
<v ->Well there are a few clinics all over the place,</v>

686
00:31:46.813 --> 00:31:49.532
and there are certain people who really pay attention

687
00:31:49.532 --> 00:31:51.283
to this and study it

688
00:31:51.283 --> 00:31:54.150
and it's not used as frequently as it should.

689
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.372
The HMO's and so forth don't go near it.

690
00:31:57.372 --> 00:31:59.995
They don't pay for it on the insurance,

691
00:31:59.995 --> 00:32:00.753
and that's one of the great--

692
00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:02.417
<v Regina>This is a big one,</v>

693
00:32:02.417 --> 00:32:03.900
and I want to get to that in a minute.

694
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.399
Say you've found out you have early stage cancer,

695
00:32:07.399 --> 00:32:08.560
and you're going to your HMO.

696
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.202
What are they going to do for you right then and there?

697
00:32:10.202 --> 00:32:12.560
<v ->They're going to give you chemotherapy and radiation.</v>

698
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.999
<v Regina>At the earliest stages?</v>

699
00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:14.939
<v ->Chemotherapy and radiation.</v>

700
00:32:14.939 --> 00:32:17.039
They're not going to look at the micrometastasis.

701
00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.395
They don't know how.

702
00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:20.902
They're looking at a microscope backwards.

703
00:32:23.432 --> 00:32:24.559
They don't have a clue.

704
00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:27.386
<v Regina>In early stage cancer using radiation</v>

705
00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:30.373
and chemotherapy, which have sometimes very

706
00:32:30.373 --> 00:32:32.185
devastating side effects as we know,

707
00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:33.220
then what kind of success--

708
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.437
<v ->You get an advantage,</v>

709
00:32:34.437 --> 00:32:36.003
then they say it's gone.

710
00:32:36.003 --> 00:32:37.487
You're in remission,

711
00:32:37.487 --> 00:32:38.873
and then one year, two years,

712
00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.283
five years, seven years,

713
00:32:41.283 --> 00:32:46.041
the most important thing for the audience to know

714
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:49.390
is that the cancer that you have been diagnosed with

715
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.722
has been there six, seven, eight years,

716
00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:57.454
and there are ways of seeing it coming early.

717
00:32:57.454 --> 00:33:00.461
This blood test in Germany is one simple place,

718
00:33:00.461 --> 00:33:04.953
but it's easy to see it with electrodermal screening,

719
00:33:04.953 --> 00:33:07.065
but never using one thing alone.

720
00:33:07.065 --> 00:33:10.317
Vector in with several different methods of diagnoses,

721
00:33:10.317 --> 00:33:15.315
conventional blood tests, PET scans, and so forth.

722
00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:18.498
CAT scans, MRI's,

723
00:33:18.498 --> 00:33:22.347
and in the case of breast cancer,

724
00:33:24.157 --> 00:33:26.081
they use mammograms.

725
00:33:26.081 --> 00:33:28.960
Well mammograms cause cancer.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

726
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.116
<v ->Mammograms not only cause cancer,</v>

727
00:33:31.116 --> 00:33:35.478
they did studies and since 1982,

728
00:33:35.478 --> 00:33:39.973
It's up I think

729
00:33:39.973 --> 00:33:44.973
380% ductal carcinoma insitu since 1982,

730
00:33:45.276 --> 00:33:48.837
since with thrust for annual mammograms.

731
00:33:48.837 --> 00:33:53.573
And the better way than mammograms is self-examination

732
00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:55.707
and thermography.

733
00:33:55.707 --> 00:33:57.477
<v Regina>What's thermography?</v>

734
00:33:57.477 --> 00:34:00.463
<v ->They have a camera that checks temperature,</v>

735
00:34:00.463 --> 00:34:05.463
and when a tumor is fed blood,

736
00:34:05.699 --> 00:34:07.557
it shows up as heat.

737
00:34:07.557 --> 00:34:08.772
Blood is warm,

738
00:34:08.772 --> 00:34:11.490
and it shows up as being heat.

739
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.425
And so they're looking for the heat imprint

740
00:34:14.425 --> 00:34:19.425
on the camera, the digital camera.

741
00:34:20.002 --> 00:34:23.524
Thermography sees cancer many years earlier.

742
00:34:23.524 --> 00:34:25.316
They don't have to clamp the breast,

743
00:34:25.316 --> 00:34:27.031
which can spread it.

744
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:28.077
As you squeeze it,

745
00:34:28.077 --> 00:34:30.892
you can squeeze it into the body like toothpaste

746
00:34:30.892 --> 00:34:33.217
and it's extremely painful.

747
00:34:33.217 --> 00:34:38.209
If doctors had that squeeze on their testicles,

748
00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.692
you wouldn't be having mammograms.

749
00:34:39.692 --> 00:34:41.526
<v Regina>No you wouldn't (laughs).</v>

750
00:34:41.526 --> 00:34:42.391
It is painful.

751
00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:43.776
<v ->So the point is mammography sees it</v>

752
00:34:43.776 --> 00:34:46.379
as much as seven years earlier.

753
00:34:46.379 --> 00:34:49.932
And nothing is perfect,

754
00:34:49.932 --> 00:34:52.043
so you do multiple vectors.

755
00:34:52.043 --> 00:34:55.638
But self-examination has been shown in Canada

756
00:34:55.638 --> 00:34:59.381
and England to be just as effective as mammograms.

757
00:34:59.381 --> 00:35:02.081
As a matter of fact more effective,

758
00:35:02.081 --> 00:35:05.045
and mammograms do cause cancer.

759
00:35:05.045 --> 00:35:05.984
When you go to the dentist--

760
00:35:05.984 --> 00:35:07.551
<v ->[Regina[ The radiation, yeah.</v>

761
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:09.111
<v ->When you go to the dentist,</v>

762
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:11.328
they put a lead sheet over your sexual organs

763
00:35:11.328 --> 00:35:14.132
when they're going to photograph your mouth, X-ray it.

764
00:35:14.132 --> 00:35:15.637
And then they run out of the room.

765
00:35:15.637 --> 00:35:18.133
Why are they running?

766
00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:21.853
Because that radiation kills the cells, it modifies them.

767
00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:25.023
They become aberrant, and they reproduce aberrantly,

768
00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:26.729
and that's cancer.

769
00:35:26.729 --> 00:35:29.023
<v Regina>Right. Well now with the thermography,</v>

770
00:35:29.023 --> 00:35:30.197
where is this available?

771
00:35:30.197 --> 00:35:32.029
What is it generally called

772
00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.426
and where is it available?

773
00:35:33.426 --> 00:35:35.016
<v ->It's called thermography,</v>

774
00:35:35.016 --> 00:35:37.549
and it's available through many

775
00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:39.778
advanced-thinking physicians.

776
00:35:39.778 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Regina>So if you went online, for example,</v>

777
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.996
to look under thermography.

778
00:35:42.996 --> 00:35:44.194
<v ->Google thermography,</v>

779
00:35:44.194 --> 00:35:47.128
and you'll find and read.

780
00:35:47.128 --> 00:35:51.289
You'll see how superior it is.

781
00:35:51.289 --> 00:35:53.827
Well in traditional medical industry,

782
00:35:53.827 --> 00:35:55.641
you're treated like a piece of meat.

783
00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:57.624
They don't talk about diet.

784
00:35:57.624 --> 00:36:01.013
They don't talk about no sugar.

785
00:36:01.013 --> 00:36:03.617
When you go to the hospital and they do an operation,

786
00:36:03.617 --> 00:36:04.855
they feed you Jello-O,

787
00:36:04.855 --> 00:36:06.752
which is 70% sugar.

788
00:36:06.752 --> 00:36:10.370
Their diet and nutrition is atrocious.

789
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.231
You have radiation.

790
00:36:14.231 --> 00:36:16.257
They want to make sure it doesn't come back,

791
00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:18.701
but that doesn't do the job.

792
00:36:18.701 --> 00:36:21.335
This blood test is the only thing I know

793
00:36:21.335 --> 00:36:24.469
that really sees and tells the physician

794
00:36:24.469 --> 00:36:27.455
what to use on that particular patient.

795
00:36:27.455 --> 00:36:30.904
For instance, I have a man whose life I saved.

796
00:36:30.904 --> 00:36:32.812
I am a consultant to people with cancer.

797
00:36:32.812 --> 00:36:33.992
I sent him to Germany.

798
00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:38.894
In this case, he had metastasized prostate to the bone.

799
00:36:39.065 --> 00:36:40.772
In excruciating pain.

800
00:36:40.772 --> 00:36:41.756
When he went overseas,

801
00:36:41.756 --> 00:36:44.089
he laid flat on the plane so that

802
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:45.956
he couldn't sit in the chair.

803
00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:48.472
He was in such excruciating pain.

804
00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:53.113
In several days they had his pain gone using Samarium,

805
00:36:53.113 --> 00:36:56.058
a product that's done differently in Germany,

806
00:36:56.058 --> 00:37:01.058
and they also found through this blood test that they use,

807
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.618
that he needed an ovarian cancer chemo,

808
00:37:06.618 --> 00:37:08.470
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>
<v ->And that did the job.</v>

809
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:13.287
It knocked out most of his cancer cells.

810
00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:18.924
Then I've seen people with colorectal cancer

811
00:37:18.924 --> 00:37:20.587
who needed her septum,

812
00:37:20.587 --> 00:37:23.883
which is used for the breast.

813
00:37:23.883 --> 00:37:25.376
So you never know,

814
00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:26.881
and that's why the chest thing,

815
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:31.385
the DNA of your cancer is the way to go.

816
00:37:32.673 --> 00:37:34.914
<v Regina>Okay so that wouldn't happen as a rule.</v>

817
00:37:34.914 --> 00:37:37.857
You would end up on a sort of a broad-spectrum

818
00:37:37.857 --> 00:37:38.934
kind of chemo?

819
00:37:38.934 --> 00:37:43.850
<v ->They have a standard protocol for various cancers,</v>

820
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.773
and it's truly medieval.

821
00:37:46.773 --> 00:37:47.648
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

822
00:37:47.648 --> 00:37:50.517
<v ->Conventional treatment is medieval.</v>

823
00:37:50.517 --> 00:37:51.488
<v Regina>So at best,</v>

824
00:37:51.488 --> 00:37:53.951
you're going to have either the tumor snipped out

825
00:37:53.951 --> 00:37:55.529
and they're going to follow it up

826
00:37:55.529 --> 00:37:57.172
with some radiation or chemo?

827
00:37:57.172 --> 00:38:01.504
<v ->No I have a clinic in Nevada</v>

828
00:38:01.504 --> 00:38:05.162
that uses a product that,

829
00:38:05.162 --> 00:38:07.381
and see in most cases when they have cancer,

830
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:10.547
the doctors want to stop the blood supply.

831
00:38:10.547 --> 00:38:13.961
Angiogenesis because the blood supplies

832
00:38:13.961 --> 00:38:17.309
feeds the tumor and it allows it to grow.

833
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:18.494
But in this case,

834
00:38:18.494 --> 00:38:21.366
this cancer clinic does not want to stop angiogenesis

835
00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:25.172
because that will bring in this medication that they have

836
00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:27.179
that's an herbal,

837
00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:29.621
it's homeopathic.

838
00:38:29.621 --> 00:38:33.503
It's herbal inside of an herb out of the far east,

839
00:38:33.503 --> 00:38:36.310
and it has a little bit of DMSO,

840
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.884
and this doctor is the only one in America using it,

841
00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:44.191
and he developed this with some ventures and scientists,

842
00:38:44.191 --> 00:38:45.544
and he does it in his clinic.

843
00:38:45.544 --> 00:38:47.784
And as a homeopathic oncologist,

844
00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:48.907
he's able to do it.

845
00:38:48.907 --> 00:38:51.604
And the results are astounding.

846
00:38:51.604 --> 00:38:55.102
Absolutely astounding because it's a different mechanism.

847
00:38:55.102 --> 00:38:56.073
It doesn't kill the cancer,

848
00:38:56.073 --> 00:39:00.084
it stops its replication and the cancer dies itself.

849
00:39:00.084 --> 00:39:02.481
<v Regina>And this is in a clinic in Nevada?</v>

850
00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:03.560
<v ->Yeah.</v>

851
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.437
<v Regina>Are you able to share,</v>

852
00:39:04.437 --> 00:39:07.112
we're going to have people go to your book.

853
00:39:07.112 --> 00:39:08.989
Certainly, and it's also.

854
00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:09.960
<v ->It's not in my book.</v>

855
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.760
Although Doctor Forsythe is the doctor in my book.

856
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.863
He's an oncologist, and he's an integrative,

857
00:39:17.863 --> 00:39:18.780
and in my opinion,

858
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.160
he's the finest integrated physician in America.

859
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.513
<v Regina>And he's the one using this particular--</v>

860
00:39:22.513 --> 00:39:25.714
<v ->He's the one doing this salicinium,</v>

861
00:39:25.714 --> 00:39:27.783
which is a product that he has developed

862
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:29.853
and he has given it to patients,

863
00:39:29.853 --> 00:39:33.020
along with chemotherapy, if necessary,

864
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.280
he uses the blood test in Germany.

865
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.009
He uses low-dose,

866
00:39:37.009 --> 00:39:40.040
he uses insulin-potentiated therapy,

867
00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.004
which sucks into the tumor,

868
00:39:43.004 --> 00:39:47.205
and so the sugar of the insulin pulls as a Trojan horse

869
00:39:47.205 --> 00:39:48.694
to chemo in there,

870
00:39:48.694 --> 00:39:52.676
so they can use low-dose 10% or 20% or 30%,

871
00:39:52.676 --> 00:39:54.986
but you don't have that systemic problem

872
00:39:54.986 --> 00:39:57.058
that you do with chemotherapy.

873
00:39:57.058 --> 00:39:58.518
<v Regina>Like pulling the rest of your immune system,</v>

874
00:39:58.518 --> 00:39:59.927
<v ->The losing your hair, vomiting, etc.</v>

875
00:39:59.927 --> 00:40:02.358
It's much less,

876
00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:04.641
but if you have to use chemotherapy.

877
00:40:04.641 --> 00:40:06.261
But in this case, in many cases,

878
00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:08.033
he doesn't have to use chemotherapy.

879
00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:09.152
<v Regina>And this is Doctor Forsythe,</v>

880
00:40:09.152 --> 00:40:11.266
F-O-R-S-Y-T-H-E?

881
00:40:11.266 --> 00:40:12.895
<v ->Yeah, if you're gonna go--</v>

882
00:40:12.895 --> 00:40:13.818
<v Regina>First name, do we need one?</v>

883
00:40:13.818 --> 00:40:14.607
<v ->His name is James.</v>

884
00:40:14.607 --> 00:40:17.209
And of course I have people go to him,

885
00:40:17.209 --> 00:40:20.175
and then I have them go to dentist.

886
00:40:20.175 --> 00:40:23.610
I have them go for colema colonics.

887
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.602
<v Regina>Can you talk about that?</v>

888
00:40:24.602 --> 00:40:26.190
We've already talked about the teeth.

889
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.756
<v ->It's very important to have the gut cleaned out.</v>

890
00:40:30.756 --> 00:40:33.038
Many people are sitting there with five to ten pounds

891
00:40:33.038 --> 00:40:35.801
of fecal matter stuck into the colon,

892
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:37.625
and they're full of parasites

893
00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:39.982
and so forth and so on.

894
00:40:39.982 --> 00:40:41.603
So all that has to be cleaned out,

895
00:40:41.603 --> 00:40:43.928
and so colonics are very important

896
00:40:43.928 --> 00:40:47.118
so you can absorb the nutrition that's given to you.

897
00:40:47.118 --> 00:40:51.064
Doctor Forsyhte is very big on nutrition.

898
00:40:51.064 --> 00:40:54.051
He has various programs for various kinds of cancer

899
00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:56.249
in nutrition to build them up,

900
00:40:56.249 --> 00:40:59.725
and then what's very important is they lymph massage.

901
00:40:59.725 --> 00:41:03.214
They have a device called the light-beam generator

902
00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:05.636
which fractionalizes molecules

903
00:41:05.636 --> 00:41:07.617
and opens up the lymph system.

904
00:41:07.617 --> 00:41:10.806
It's ignored in conventional medicine,

905
00:41:10.806 --> 00:41:13.302
except when they have cancer in the lymph.

906
00:41:13.302 --> 00:41:14.261
<v Regina>Right.</v>

907
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:18.021
<v ->But they don't understand that the lymph can be opened up.</v>

908
00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:21.273
I earned an honorary doctorate by writing about that.

909
00:41:21.273 --> 00:41:24.826
It's called "The light-beam generator."

910
00:41:24.826 --> 00:41:27.269
There was an admiral in Pennsylvania

911
00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:28.911
who had a wife with lymphodema.

912
00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:30.927
Her leg was so big she was about to bust.

913
00:41:30.927 --> 00:41:32.441
She was dying.

914
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:34.766
The Rear Admiral Timothy Fanning,

915
00:41:34.766 --> 00:41:38.361
read my book, found "The Light-Beam Generator."

916
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:41.411
Found a doctor in Oregon who practiced it.

917
00:41:41.411 --> 00:41:44.494
Went there, and they helped fractionalize the buildup

918
00:41:44.494 --> 00:41:49.027
of calcium, the key that allowed that lymphodema to expand.

919
00:41:49.027 --> 00:41:52.034
This doctor used a dark-field microscope.

920
00:41:52.034 --> 00:41:54.232
And dark-field microscopy is very important.

921
00:41:54.232 --> 00:41:56.344
<v Regina>What did you call it again?</v>

922
00:41:56.344 --> 00:41:57.922
<v ->Dark-field microscopy.</v>

923
00:41:57.922 --> 00:41:59.468
<v Regina>Let's talk about that.</v>

924
00:41:59.468 --> 00:42:00.835
<v ->Seen in the blood.</v>

925
00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:03.127
And they put this patient to sleep.

926
00:42:03.127 --> 00:42:05.666
Woke her up in two hours, pricked her finger,

927
00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:08.758
and found an elephantitis parasite.

928
00:42:08.758 --> 00:42:11.501
So they used a drug out of England that was for

929
00:42:11.501 --> 00:42:14.935
elephantitis using alternative and conventional

930
00:42:14.935 --> 00:42:16.886
using integrated medicine,

931
00:42:16.886 --> 00:42:20.258
and voila she's alive today, Muffy Fanning.

932
00:42:20.258 --> 00:42:20.961
<v Regina>Incredible.</v>

933
00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:22.754
<v ->She has another name now, they divorced.</v>

934
00:42:22.754 --> 00:42:26.572
And he became Chairman of the board of a medical school

935
00:42:26.572 --> 00:42:30.231
and gave me an honorary doctorate in humanities.

936
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:31.308
So you can call me doctor.

937
00:42:31.308 --> 00:42:33.400
<v Regina>Doctor Burton Goldberg.</v>

938
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.777
Well you know, you deserve it.

939
00:42:35.777 --> 00:42:39.723
By now you have done such an incredible job of research.

940
00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:42.551
But I don't want to wrap it up just yet.

941
00:42:42.551 --> 00:42:46.144
So we start with going to your dentist

942
00:42:46.144 --> 00:42:49.291
and having the middle fillings basically silver--

943
00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:51.328
<v ->Going to a biologic dentist.</v>

944
00:42:51.328 --> 00:42:52.588
Don't go to your dentist because

945
00:42:52.588 --> 00:42:55.596
your dentist is probably ignorant of the importance

946
00:42:55.596 --> 00:42:58.506
and how root canals can go bad.

947
00:42:58.506 --> 00:43:00.822
Cavitations, where a tooth is pulled,

948
00:43:00.822 --> 00:43:02.102
like a wisdom tooth,

949
00:43:02.102 --> 00:43:05.558
and if the doctor didn't properly go in there and cleanse,

950
00:43:05.558 --> 00:43:08.863
scrape down to the bone getting rid all the necrotic tissue,

951
00:43:08.863 --> 00:43:10.282
it heals over.

952
00:43:10.282 --> 00:43:12.361
You don't have any inclination,

953
00:43:12.361 --> 00:43:13.718
but it's brewing in there,

954
00:43:13.718 --> 00:43:15.466
affecting the meridian system,

955
00:43:15.466 --> 00:43:17.466
so it's gonna affect every organ and system in the body.

956
00:43:17.466 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Regina>Well this is another thing.</v>

957
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.356
We think of reflexology.

958
00:43:20.356 --> 00:43:24.195
We think of acupuncture, acupressure, and etc.

959
00:43:24.195 --> 00:43:27.043
It's starting in the hands,

960
00:43:27.043 --> 00:43:28.845
terminating in the hands, the feet, and the ears,

961
00:43:28.845 --> 00:43:31.395
but it's not very often that you hear about the meridians

962
00:43:31.395 --> 00:43:36.002
running through basically the jaw and the teeth.

963
00:43:36.002 --> 00:43:38.745
That's a really big point that's ignored.

964
00:43:38.745 --> 00:43:39.597
<v ->You know that song,</v>

965
00:43:39.597 --> 00:43:41.484
"The kneebone is connected to the headbone?"

966
00:43:41.484 --> 00:43:43.300
Praise the Lord.

967
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.804
<v Regina>Everything is connected to the toothbone,</v>

968
00:43:44.804 --> 00:43:45.858
fom what I'm hearing here.

969
00:43:45.858 --> 00:43:47.833
<v ->Everything is connected.</v>

970
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:50.168
That's why reflexology is the bottom of the feet.

971
00:43:50.168 --> 00:43:52.130
You have the same thing in your hands.

972
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.921
You have microsystems throughout the body.

973
00:43:53.921 --> 00:43:56.865
The ear, the auricular therapy.

974
00:43:56.865 --> 00:44:01.720
There's a wonderful device called the Ondamed,

975
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:06.414
O-N-D-A-M-E-D dot net or org.

976
00:44:06.414 --> 00:44:10.436
This device does the work of Nogier in France

977
00:44:10.436 --> 00:44:12.973
where you unravel.

978
00:44:12.973 --> 00:44:14.787
People are stuck,

979
00:44:14.787 --> 00:44:17.240
and they'd hold the pulse,

980
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.290
and they run these frequencies, right frequencies.

981
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.020
This is way beyond rife

982
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.146
and Gonoans have been able to reproduce Rife's work.

983
00:44:26.146 --> 00:44:28.770
But this device is great for Lyme disease

984
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.753
and for all kinds of health conditions,

985
00:44:30.753 --> 00:44:35.277
emotional conditions by unblocking it,

986
00:44:35.277 --> 00:44:38.806
and going one thing after another using frequencies.

987
00:44:38.806 --> 00:44:43.010
It runs through 32,000 so-called Rife frequencies,

988
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.981
but it's a biofeedback device.

989
00:44:44.981 --> 00:44:47.169
FDA approved, and it's wonderful

990
00:44:47.169 --> 00:44:51.296
for all kinds of health conditions, including cancer.

991
00:44:51.296 --> 00:44:56.296
<v Regina>So we have again, you go to a bio dentist,</v>

992
00:44:56.909 --> 00:44:58.453
you have your colonics to flesh out--

993
00:44:58.453 --> 00:44:59.626
<v ->Biologic dentist.</v>

994
00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:00.341
<v Regina>Biologic dentist.</v>

995
00:45:00.341 --> 00:45:03.404
<v ->It's very important that you use one who understands</v>

996
00:45:03.404 --> 00:45:06.474
the relationship between the teeth and the body.

997
00:45:07.484 --> 00:45:11.183
Any dentist, of course, and when they do remove the mercury,

998
00:45:11.183 --> 00:45:13.072
it has to be done properly because

999
00:45:13.072 --> 00:45:14.928
you can get in deeper trouble

1000
00:45:14.928 --> 00:45:17.264
if you go to an ordinary dentist because

1001
00:45:20.194 --> 00:45:22.871
a good biologic dentist wear a gas mask,

1002
00:45:22.871 --> 00:45:26.456
so he himself and his nurse and the patient

1003
00:45:26.456 --> 00:45:30.113
will be on oxygen and have a dam in the mouth,

1004
00:45:30.113 --> 00:45:33.975
and there'll be a suction pulling out all these vapors

1005
00:45:33.975 --> 00:45:35.521
that come from mercury.

1006
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:40.521
Mercury fillings leech 24 hours every day of your life,

1007
00:45:40.662 --> 00:45:44.801
and that mercury then becomes an organic mercury,

1008
00:45:44.801 --> 00:45:47.872
which is 100 times more toxic.

1009
00:45:47.872 --> 00:45:49.175
<v Regina>Oh boy I think it's time to--</v>

1010
00:45:49.175 --> 00:45:53.824
<v ->I'm doing a movie now called "Do No Harm",</v>

1011
00:45:53.824 --> 00:45:58.824
and one of my major storylines is Autism.

1012
00:46:00.651 --> 00:46:03.754
Autism has increased in America

1013
00:46:03.754 --> 00:46:08.317
from 1992 to 2002

1014
00:46:08.317 --> 00:46:13.290
1,700%.

1015
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.554
Our children are being destroyed

1016
00:46:17.554 --> 00:46:20.412
and being poisoned to death through the mother

1017
00:46:20.412 --> 00:46:23.773
through the umbilical cord by heavy metals,

1018
00:46:23.773 --> 00:46:27.260
and I don't mean mercury from thimerosal, the injections,

1019
00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.388
but cadmium, lead, aluminum,

1020
00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:33.900
and all the poisons and toxins.

1021
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.983
And the wonderful story here is that there is

1022
00:46:36.983 --> 00:46:39.805
a wonderful doctor by the name of Amy Yasko,

1023
00:46:39.805 --> 00:46:41.752
a Ph.D. up in Maine,

1024
00:46:41.752 --> 00:46:46.403
who discovered that these autistic children have a gene,

1025
00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:49.346
the COM something or other gene,

1026
00:46:49.346 --> 00:46:52.440
that does not allow them to detoxify.

1027
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.347
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

1028
00:46:53.347 --> 00:46:55.863
<v ->So when they have hair analysis for heavy metals,</v>

1029
00:46:55.863 --> 00:46:59.245
those children who have no heavy metals in the hair

1030
00:46:59.245 --> 00:47:02.007
are the ones that are the worst because

1031
00:47:02.007 --> 00:47:04.461
they haven't been able to detoxify

1032
00:47:04.461 --> 00:47:06.658
and allow the metals to end up in the hair.

1033
00:47:06.658 --> 00:47:08.193
<v Regina>And all of these metals,</v>

1034
00:47:08.193 --> 00:47:10.445
if you have an overabundance of them,

1035
00:47:10.445 --> 00:47:12.194
interfere with brain functioning.

1036
00:47:12.194 --> 00:47:12.819
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1037
00:47:12.819 --> 00:47:13.458
<v Regina>Every one of them.</v>

1038
00:47:13.458 --> 00:47:14.408
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1039
00:47:14.408 --> 00:47:14.658
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

1040
00:47:14.658 --> 00:47:17.199
<v ->And that is one of the major problems.</v>

1041
00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:19.094
And how do they know this?

1042
00:47:19.094 --> 00:47:20.183
What is the proof?

1043
00:47:20.183 --> 00:47:22.422
Because they detoxified,

1044
00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:27.235
she has an RNA product that will switch

1045
00:47:27.235 --> 00:47:28.716
the genes on and off.

1046
00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:30.732
In this case, you want to switch on the gene

1047
00:47:30.732 --> 00:47:32.780
that prohibits the detoxification,

1048
00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.061
to turn around the opposite way,

1049
00:47:35.061 --> 00:47:37.025
and the children start dumping once they're

1050
00:47:37.025 --> 00:47:39.111
given chelating aspects,

1051
00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:42.022
the various methods of chelation,

1052
00:47:42.022 --> 00:47:44.498
or pulling out the heavy metals,

1053
00:47:44.498 --> 00:47:46.780
and these children become normal.

1054
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Regina>Yeah. This is incredible.</v>

1055
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.332
<v ->And that's the movie I'm doing for the silver screen</v>

1056
00:47:50.332 --> 00:47:51.674
called "Do No Harm."

1057
00:47:51.674 --> 00:47:52.730
<v Regina>Wonderful.</v>

1058
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.052
We should get you in touch with Ron Davis,

1059
00:47:55.052 --> 00:47:57.321
who we also feature on our site who works with

1060
00:47:57.321 --> 00:48:01.289
autism and dyslexia and is autistic himself.

1061
00:48:01.289 --> 00:48:02.856
Was born autistic.

1062
00:48:02.856 --> 00:48:04.191
It might be very interesting work

1063
00:48:04.191 --> 00:48:06.431
the two of you could share.

1064
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:09.832
Do you have something more about autism

1065
00:48:09.832 --> 00:48:11.389
or can we bounce back a bit because

1066
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.768
I want to get your take on some things.

1067
00:48:13.768 --> 00:48:14.578
You okay with this?

1068
00:48:14.578 --> 00:48:18.866
Okay, so going back into the cancer scene.

1069
00:48:20.626 --> 00:48:21.802
We've looked at the colonics

1070
00:48:21.802 --> 00:48:26.517
and the biological dentistry, lymph massage,

1071
00:48:26.517 --> 00:48:28.052
and you brought up a number of--

1072
00:48:28.052 --> 00:48:29.073
<v ->Diet and nutrition.</v>

1073
00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:29.801
<v Regina>Diet and nutrition.</v>

1074
00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:30.898
I want to talk to you about that next.

1075
00:48:30.898 --> 00:48:32.317
<v ->And psychological.</v>

1076
00:48:32.317 --> 00:48:34.310
The mind and body.

1077
00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.690
<v Regina>Let's go next to how</v>

1078
00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:41.690
the dietary element of the creation of cancer,

1079
00:48:42.034 --> 00:48:44.310
some of the biggest culprits.

1080
00:48:45.117 --> 00:48:49.180
<v ->Well, we put hormones in our beef</v>

1081
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.624
to make them big and fat.

1082
00:48:51.624 --> 00:48:54.044
We use antibiotics to keep them alive

1083
00:48:54.044 --> 00:48:55.558
in filthy conditions,

1084
00:48:55.558 --> 00:48:58.429
both chickens as well as beef and chicken.

1085
00:48:58.429 --> 00:49:02.128
We feed them food that they're not accustomed to,

1086
00:49:02.128 --> 00:49:06.645
grain-fed, so they become more delicious to the palate,

1087
00:49:06.645 --> 00:49:09.715
but at the same time, starving us.

1088
00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:13.276
And it's just not normal.

1089
00:49:13.276 --> 00:49:14.151
<v Regina>So for the beef and--</v>

1090
00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:16.423
<v ->So when you have sick animals,</v>

1091
00:49:16.423 --> 00:49:17.969
you just give them more antibiotics.

1092
00:49:17.969 --> 00:49:19.364
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1093
00:49:19.364 --> 00:49:21.499
<v ->Milk is a good example.</v>

1094
00:49:21.499 --> 00:49:26.107
Milk is full of antibiotics that the cows are given.

1095
00:49:26.107 --> 00:49:27.898
<v Regina>That's because the utters get infected,</v>

1096
00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:28.571
so they have--

1097
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:31.664
<v ->Particularly with the bovine growth hormone,</v>

1098
00:49:31.664 --> 00:49:33.873
this does give more infections.

1099
00:49:33.873 --> 00:49:38.873
And so the FDA has allowed more and more

1100
00:49:39.619 --> 00:49:41.718
antibiotics to be used on these animals,

1101
00:49:41.718 --> 00:49:43.020
and it goes into our body,

1102
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.335
and it affects us because

1103
00:49:45.335 --> 00:49:49.643
it then kills off the friendly bacteria within our body.

1104
00:49:49.643 --> 00:49:52.118
And this is one of the reasons why our immune systems

1105
00:49:52.118 --> 00:49:55.185
are so poorly adjusted.

1106
00:49:55.185 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Regina>So secondhand antibiotics,</v>

1107
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.410
secondhand growth hormones.

1108
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.787
<v ->But one of the major causes of cancer in this country</v>

1109
00:50:01.787 --> 00:50:04.896
is nuclear energy.

1110
00:50:07.101 --> 00:50:08.746
<v Regina>Let's talk about that.</v>

1111
00:50:08.746 --> 00:50:13.613
<v ->Nuclear energy has about 20 toxins emanating</v>

1112
00:50:13.613 --> 00:50:17.154
from every smoke stack on every nuclear power plant

1113
00:50:17.154 --> 00:50:19.382
and nuclear bomb.

1114
00:50:19.382 --> 00:50:22.519
Strontium-90 is one that they test.

1115
00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:25.848
There is a study in this country called

1116
00:50:25.848 --> 00:50:27.085
the "Toothfairy Project",

1117
00:50:27.085 --> 00:50:29.122
where they take deciduous teeth of children,

1118
00:50:29.122 --> 00:50:30.807
children's teeth fall out,

1119
00:50:30.807 --> 00:50:34.742
and then instead of drilling into the bone,

1120
00:50:34.742 --> 00:50:35.919
you can take their teeth,

1121
00:50:35.919 --> 00:50:37.730
and you find those children with cancer

1122
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.611
with higher rates of Strontium-90, Iodine-131,

1123
00:50:41.611 --> 00:50:44.032
and all those other toxins.

1124
00:50:44.032 --> 00:50:47.853
Every nuclear power plant in America emanates

1125
00:50:47.853 --> 00:50:51.829
and causes higher rates of cancer within 100 mile

1126
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:54.433
of every plant.

1127
00:50:54.433 --> 00:50:58.453
In California, it goes into the water supply,

1128
00:50:58.453 --> 00:51:01.951
into winter vegetables in the San Joaquin Valley.

1129
00:51:01.951 --> 00:51:03.413
It goes in the sky,

1130
00:51:03.413 --> 00:51:05.707
so you have higher rates of cancer around

1131
00:51:05.707 --> 00:51:07.765
every nuclear power plant.

1132
00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:12.897
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, has one of the highest rates.

1133
00:51:12.897 --> 00:51:16.374
They have 11 operating nuclear power plants

1134
00:51:16.374 --> 00:51:19.830
feeding the citizens of Philadephia.

1135
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.410
Three-Mile island, we all know that story,

1136
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:25.248
and there's many others.

1137
00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:29.643
In New York state, Long Island has a plant.

1138
00:51:29.643 --> 00:51:31.242
There's two I think out there.

1139
00:51:31.242 --> 00:51:32.693
There's two in Connecticut.

1140
00:51:32.693 --> 00:51:34.828
There's some in New Jersey,

1141
00:51:34.828 --> 00:51:37.993
and the lobster in Long Island Sound,

1142
00:51:37.993 --> 00:51:40.896
not only the tissue,

1143
00:51:40.896 --> 00:51:44.982
but the shell and the tissue have Strontium-90 in it.

1144
00:51:44.982 --> 00:51:48.328
Now what is wrong with Strontium-90?

1145
00:51:48.328 --> 00:51:50.932
It only emanates from nuclear energy.

1146
00:51:50.932 --> 00:51:55.932
It never existed on earth until nuclear power was invented.

1147
00:51:57.105 --> 00:51:59.859
And it goes into the body,

1148
00:51:59.859 --> 00:52:02.318
goes into the bone marrow,

1149
00:52:02.318 --> 00:52:05.080
which is the center of B-cells,

1150
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.003
and is the heart of our immune system.

1151
00:52:08.003 --> 00:52:09.870
And it destroys it,

1152
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.711
and then it converts inside the body to yttrium,

1153
00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:17.988
from strontium to yttrium-90,

1154
00:52:17.988 --> 00:52:20.046
and that destroys the bone marrow.

1155
00:52:20.046 --> 00:52:22.255
And so that's one of the mechanisms.

1156
00:52:22.255 --> 00:52:24.854
<v Regina>So this has to do with leukemia in children?</v>

1157
00:52:24.854 --> 00:52:25.610
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1158
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:26.133
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1159
00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:27.861
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1160
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:30.485
This nuclear energy has to do with asthma

1161
00:52:30.485 --> 00:52:33.589
and all these high rates of diabetes.

1162
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:37.407
Everything. It affects the entire organs and entire body.

1163
00:52:37.407 --> 00:52:39.946
It is imperative to know this.

1164
00:52:39.946 --> 00:52:42.954
Now there's radiation dot org is a wonderful

1165
00:52:42.954 --> 00:52:44.479
website to go to.

1166
00:52:44.479 --> 00:52:47.198
Www dot radiation dot org.

1167
00:52:47.198 --> 00:52:50.836
Very important to read about the "Toothfairy Project"

1168
00:52:50.836 --> 00:52:55.836
and to see the U.S. government's statistics showing

1169
00:52:56.062 --> 00:53:00.040
and proving that nuclear energy

1170
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.969
is highly detrimental to the human.

1171
00:53:05.009 --> 00:53:06.829
<v Regina>Okay so not good for people who</v>

1172
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:10.383
live in close proximity to a nuclear power plant.

1173
00:53:10.383 --> 00:53:13.477
So what does go past that now to--

1174
00:53:13.477 --> 00:53:18.357
<v ->When these power plants are disassembled,</v>

1175
00:53:18.357 --> 00:53:21.791
like up in Maine, Yankee Plant was stopped,

1176
00:53:21.791 --> 00:53:26.216
there's no longer radiation in the shells

1177
00:53:26.216 --> 00:53:29.270
and the tissue of the lobsters of Maine.

1178
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.709
<v Regina>So don't eat Maine lobster.</v>

1179
00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:33.641
<v ->Don't eat Long Island lobster.</v>

1180
00:53:33.641 --> 00:53:34.654
Eat Maine lobster.

1181
00:53:34.654 --> 00:53:36.275
<v Regina>Okay that's right.</v>

1182
00:53:36.275 --> 00:53:38.762
<v ->It's not lobster, it's lobster (with accent).</v>

1183
00:53:38.762 --> 00:53:40.466
(laughs)

1184
00:53:40.466 --> 00:53:42.942
<v Regina>(with accent) No Long Island lobster.</v>

1185
00:53:42.942 --> 00:53:44.018
(laughs)

1186
00:53:45.948 --> 00:53:47.667
<v ->Well Long Island's a very good example.</v>

1187
00:53:47.667 --> 00:53:51.092
We had so many farmers and pesticides and herbicides

1188
00:53:51.092 --> 00:53:53.634
and extremely high rates of cancer.

1189
00:53:53.634 --> 00:53:57.165
You put that stack on top of the nuclear energy,

1190
00:53:57.165 --> 00:54:01.132
and voila, you end up with this epidemic of cancer.

1191
00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:06.163
And incidentally, Mad Cow disease is in this country.

1192
00:54:06.163 --> 00:54:06.722
<v Regina>Is in this country.</v>

1193
00:54:06.722 --> 00:54:08.065
<v ->Is in this country.</v>

1194
00:54:08.065 --> 00:54:13.040
You Google Yale University Jakob Creutzfeldt.

1195
00:54:13.697 --> 00:54:15.064
<v Regina>How do you spell that?</v>

1196
00:54:15.064 --> 00:54:17.716
<v ->Jacob J-A-C-O-B Creutzfeldt,</v>

1197
00:54:17.716 --> 00:54:18.815
I can't remember.

1198
00:54:18.815 --> 00:54:23.393
Yale University autopsies Alzheimer.

1199
00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:27.540
14% of the autopsies on Alzheimer patients

1200
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.897
were Mad Cow's Disease.

1201
00:54:28.897 --> 00:54:33.077
At Yale, five-and-a-half percent at University of Pittsburg.

1202
00:54:33.077 --> 00:54:33.423
<v Regina>Oh my gosh.</v>

1203
00:54:33.423 --> 00:54:35.962
Now this is information that should have made the news.

1204
00:54:35.962 --> 00:54:37.326
<v ->This doesn't make the news because</v>

1205
00:54:37.326 --> 00:54:41.593
they have the pharmaceutical industrial process to try

1206
00:54:41.593 --> 00:54:43.906
keeping the media closed-mouthed.

1207
00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:45.817
It's there. I found it.

1208
00:54:45.817 --> 00:54:47.693
I've done editorials on it.

1209
00:54:47.693 --> 00:54:49.688
You talk about whistleblowing,

1210
00:54:49.688 --> 00:54:52.078
and let me give you another story.

1211
00:54:52.078 --> 00:54:53.102
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

1212
00:54:54.842 --> 00:54:57.176
<v ->The agriculture department of the United States government</v>

1213
00:54:57.176 --> 00:55:02.174
was asked by Stanley Prusiner who won a Nobel Prize

1214
00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:04.297
for doing the prion,

1215
00:55:04.297 --> 00:55:06.506
which is the basis of Mad Cow's Disease.

1216
00:55:06.506 --> 00:55:09.354
That's the pathogen.

1217
00:55:09.354 --> 00:55:14.110
He said, "We can test every animal for a dollar an animal."

1218
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.894
It was Creekstone with the shippers,

1219
00:55:16.894 --> 00:55:18.579
they want to ship to Japan.

1220
00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:23.141
They were denied by the agriculture institute.

1221
00:55:23.141 --> 00:55:26.499
It was denied by the Agriculture Department of the

1222
00:55:26.499 --> 00:55:28.461
United States government.

1223
00:55:28.461 --> 00:55:32.274
They are all in collusion.

1224
00:55:32.504 --> 00:55:34.946
Mad Cow's Disease is in this country

1225
00:55:34.946 --> 00:55:37.571
and it's responsible for an enormous amount

1226
00:55:37.571 --> 00:55:40.673
of Alzheimer's disease.

1227
00:55:40.673 --> 00:55:41.772
<v Regina>Burton.</v>

1228
00:55:41.772 --> 00:55:43.339
Well first of all,

1229
00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:45.389
I know that we could talk for days

1230
00:55:45.389 --> 00:55:47.854
and we're almost at the end of the first hour,

1231
00:55:47.854 --> 00:55:49.987
so what I'd like to do is stop here

1232
00:55:49.987 --> 00:55:51.874
and then we're going to jump over.

1233
00:55:51.874 --> 00:55:54.166
We've got a number of things I want to talk

1234
00:55:54.166 --> 00:55:55.831
to you about and just put a new tape in

1235
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:57.526
and go to part two.
