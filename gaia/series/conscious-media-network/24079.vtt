00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Lorraine Day did
something most people

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.000 align:middle line:90%
haven't had the courage to do.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.310 align:middle line:84%
When diagnosed with
cancer, she decided

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:84%
to heal herself without the
aid of the medical community.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.060 align:middle line:84%
What makes this story
particularly interesting

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is that she herself is a highly
respected orthopedic surgeon.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead, after 30
years as an agnostic,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.790 align:middle line:84%
she turned to belief and an
ancient recipe for health

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:84%
from the Old Testament
after she learned

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:90%
that the cancer had spread.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's start a little
bit with your own story

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and how you ended up
where you are today.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of it
was pretty trying,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.076 align:middle line:90%
physically and otherwise.

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, that's right.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I developed cancer in 1992
with a very small lump.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
It was about half the size
of an almond or even smaller.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.565 align:middle line:84%
And it just bothered me
when I put my seat belt on.

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
it was cancer,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
because it was high
up on my chest.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.977 align:middle line:84%
And the plastic surgeon that
did the biopsy at Loma Linda

00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:84%
University, he didn't think
it was cancer, either.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And I had it done under local.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But then he called
me a few days later

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and said that not only
did I have cancer,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:84%
but there were
not clear margins.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
It had already spread
into my chest wall.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:90%
So I had another biopsy.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I actually
thought you can cut cancer out.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Now I know you cannot cut cancer
out and get rid of it that way,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
because all the factors that
allowed the cancer to develop

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:84%
are still present in your
body unless you change the way

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:84%
you're eating and living and
everything about your life.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I had another
biopsy done down

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:90%
at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:90%
It's near San Diego.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And I let them put me to
sleep to see if they could get

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
clear margins, which
they still could not get.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I told them, you
cannot do a mastectomy,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%
which they recommended.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said I was not going
to do chemo or radiation.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting thing
is both of my surgeons

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:90%
were personal friends.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
One was from-- that
I knew in college.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was a resident
with me at UC San Francisco.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And they thought I had
lost my mind, because I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
said I'm not doing chemo,
I'm not doing radiation.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%
And they said, why not?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
chemotherapy is poison.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you and
I were both taught

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.647 align:middle line:90%
that chemotherapy causes cancer.

00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, every doctor knows that.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.265 align:middle line:90%
The patients don't know that.

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
The patients are all
surprised when I say,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy causes cancer.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, my
doctor wouldn't give me

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
something that causes cancer
when I already have cancer.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yes, they
would, because they

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
don't know what else to do.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But by that time,
I had found out

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that there was another
way to get well.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had found that
out because people

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
had written to me,
showing me that there

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
was a huge cover-up
in cancer cures.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
And I was quite shocked.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I investigated
the information.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I had
had my own radio show

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
called "Truth Serum,"
where I was interviewing

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
alternative doctors at
the time that I found out

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I myself had cancer.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know exactly what
to do at the beginning.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But I did know that I had to
change my diet to a totally

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
vegan diet, because during
the time I had my radio show,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I had been going around the
country interviewing people

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I had heard had gotten well by
natural methods from cancer.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.190 align:middle line:84%
This was before I
knew I had cancer.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing that
all of them had done

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
was change to a totally
vegan vegetarian diet, which

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:84%
means no animal products, no
meat, poultry, fish, dairy,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
eggs, anything like that.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, the lump was small,
very small, at first.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it
wasn't all removed,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
because I did not
have clear margins.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So I changed my diet to
a totally vegan diet.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
That was the right diet.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's not enough to get you
well from any major disease.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, did the growth
continue at this point?

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happened for
about nine months.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the tumor returned
right in the same place.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And on my website, I
show those pictures.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>It was huge.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it only-- about
nine months later,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.422 align:middle line:84%
it just regrew to
the size of a marble.

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:21.922 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:04:21.922 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I was just referring
to the pictures

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
on your site of what
ultimately happened.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I
was in trouble when

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:84%
it returned, because I was doing
everything I knew how to do,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
which was just changing my diet.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the right diet.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's not enough by itself
to get you well from disease.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So I then started
searching around.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I tried over 40 different
types of alternative medicines.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:90%
I tried the macrobiotic diet.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I tried 714-X, the
Rife generator,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and many, many other
kinds-- long enough

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:90%
to find out if they would work.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't change.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The tumor didn't
go down in size.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, about nine months
after that, suddenly,

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
over a three-week
period of time,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the tumor grew from
the size of a marble

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to the size of a
large grapefruit

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%
that you see on my website.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it wasn't
terribly painful.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But over the next
few weeks to months,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
it became terribly,
terribly painful.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was in
serious trouble, because I

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what to do.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'd tried all of
these alternatives.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I tried over 40.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And none of them worked.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So I then-- I had started
studying the Bible.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And let me say
right off the bat,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not into organized religion.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
Christianity is not a religion.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had been an agnostic for
virtually all of my adult life.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
I knew everything

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
every other doctor knew.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that regular
medicine could not get me well.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Again, I refused chemo.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I refused radiation.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't get involved
with any of those.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that a
mastectomy wouldn't help me,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
get breast cancer

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
because I had too many breasts.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Cutting organs off or out
does not solve the problem.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.776 align:middle line:84%
If you keep on doing
what you've always done,

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll keep on being
what you've always been.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%
So something had to change.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't understand
what I needed to change.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the human body is
meant to heal itself.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:84%
If you get a cut, it will
heal, unless you have destroyed

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
your immune system so
much with the way you live

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
or chemotherapy or
anything else like that

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
or if you dig it open every
day or if you put dirt in it.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do
something traumatic

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to the cut on your hand
to keep it from healing.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:90%
The body is meant to heal.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I just had to find
out the things

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing to
my body that caused it

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
not to heal or to find out
the situation I was in.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I gave myself cancer.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know I was doing it.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Talk about how that--

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.585 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I gave myself cancer.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Everybody gives themself cancer.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.236 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
like to admit that.

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's like
being an alcoholic.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You can't get well
from alcoholism

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:84%
unless you admit publicly
you did this to yourself.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And people have a very
difficult time doing that.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize that
the very things that they

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
do every day are the
things that cause

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
cancer and Parkinson's
and all that.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, disease is a
spiritual problem.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It starts in your heart,
because you want to eat and live

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
the way you want to eat and
live rather than the way God

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
has designed us to eat and live.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn that.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I started
studying the Bible.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:90%
I was not healed miraculously.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I was healed the way
anybody else can be healed.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a long, hard struggle
and a very regimented plan.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And it took 18 months
for me to get well.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
For two years, I was getting
worse and worse and worse.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, how
did you follow your progress?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I followed my
progress by getting

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:90%
worse and worse and worse.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But I still would not go to
the conventional doctors,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
because I had seen too
many thousands of patients

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
die from the treatment
we give them.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Chemotherapy is poison.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It causes cancer.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Every doctor knows that.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Radiation-- doctors will tell
you, don't get too many x-rays.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:90%
X-rays cause cancer.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
cancer, then they

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
say, we have to give
you huge doses of what

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
we told you to avoid,
because it causes cancer.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because doctors
don't know how to treat cancer.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We're never taught, because
the pharmaceutical industries

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
control much of what is
taught in medical school,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
because they give the majority
of funding for research.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And they only teach
surgery and drugs.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>And we're going to talk about
that whole cancer industry

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:90%
also in a minute.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>So continuing your story,
you got worse for two years.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>So I got worse for
two years until I

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:90%
was bedridden for six months.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I was not expected
to live through the night.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.647 align:middle line:84%
And my husband at
the time said, I've

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:90%
got to take you to the hospital.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not going, because
I knew that, if I went,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
they would give me drugs.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had so little life
left in me that I would die.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:90%
So I did pray to the Lord.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is
not working so well.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do this.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And God has promised
in Psalms 103:3

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:90%
that he heals all our diseases.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
But he does tell us
how he does this.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
In Deuteronomy, Chapter 7,
versus 11 to 15, he said,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
"If you obey my laws"-- that
includes his health laws--

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
"my commandments,
and my decrees,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I will keep you free
from every disease."

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.222 align:middle line:84%
So I prayed, and I
said, you're going

00:09:48.222 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to have to show me how to
do this, because I'm dying.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to go do that,
because I know that's wrong.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to do
conventional medicine.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.635 align:middle line:84%
So God impressed on my mind a
way to stay alive during that

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:02.135 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I discuss that on
my video "Cancer Doesn't

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Scare Me Anymore" how I
actually stayed alive,

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't been able to
eat anything for two weeks,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and I hadn't been able to
drink anything for three days.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And my lungs were
filling up with fluid.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I was having great
difficulty breathing.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And since I'm a
trauma surgeon, I

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
know what people look
like when they're dying.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that I was dying.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:90%
But I held true.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not
going to do it man's way.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it God's way.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And the way I got well was with
all things that are natural,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
the things that God has created
in their most natural form.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's all free,
except for food.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
buy that, anyway.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
God would do it.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
He would make it
so everybody has

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:90%
access to the way to get well.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But you see, what
man has done is

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
he has taken over medicine,
which we'll talk about later,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and made it into a very
expensive thing and said,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in order for you to get well,
you've got to come to us

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and pay big money.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what humanity has
also done with religion.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
You want to get saved,
you've got to come to us.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make an
industry out of religion.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:90%
You come, and you pay money.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And God says, it's a personal
relationship with me.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%
You just come to me.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:90%
You don't need an organization.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:84%
He showed me how to stay
alive over the next few days.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had some knowledge
of some of the things

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to do by
that time, such as I

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:90%
stayed on the same diet.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:90%
The diet was not a juice diet.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I drank a lot of juices,
13 fresh homemade vegetable

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
juices, 12 vegetable juices
and one fruit juice, every day

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:90%
in between meals.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.265 align:middle line:84%
I ate all natural food,
three meals a day.

00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Because people
are always saying,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:90%
well, you went on a juice diet.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:90%
No, I did not.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
The juice is to get huge
amounts of nutrition

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
into you in a form
where your body doesn't

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
have to spend
energy digesting it.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But I got my fiber
and all from eating

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:90%
three regular meals a day.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>And you were
able to eat again.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
After several days, after I
went through this crisis period,

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I was able to start drinking
first and then eating.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized-- I
searched not only the Bible.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Bible to see what
was the original diet given

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of Eden, which was
a totally natural vegan diet.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:90%
So I started on that diet.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I started searching
the medical literature,

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
finding all the things
that we doctors are never

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
told in medical school,
such as cancerous tumors

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
grow twice as fast
if you're breathing

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:90%
indoor air as outdoor air.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is well documented
in the medical literature.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a lot
of time outdoors.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I found out that
sunlight reduces

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
the size of internal
cancerous tumors

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and does not cause skin cancer.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:90%
And I explain that on my videos.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
It does not cause skin cancer.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:84%
It is the way we're eating
that causes skin cancer,

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
because skin cancer was not a
problem for thousands of years.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors lived outdoors
and worked outdoors,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't get skin cancer.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a new phenomenon.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
is, from 1908,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:84%
where the-- 1909, I
guess, the statistics

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
showed that 1 out
of 33 Americans

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:90%
had cancer-- 1 out of 33.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
the average American

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
was eating 200 pounds
of grains a year

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and 200 pounds of
fresh potatoes,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:90%
not fast food French fries.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>And so they were eating
mainly a plant-based diet.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
By 1985, the incidence of
grain eating had gone in half.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And the incidence of
natural potato eating

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:90%
had decreased by 50%.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
The incidence of meat
eating had doubled,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
the incidence of milk
drinking had doubled,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and the incidence of chicken
eating had gone up 300%.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And now the incidence
of cancer was 1 out

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.551 align:middle line:90%
of 3 instead of 1 out of 33.

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>So as we changed from a
plant-based diet, mainly,

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.117 align:middle line:90%
to an animal product--

00:14:16.117 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>And refined.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>--based diet-- and refined
and sugar and all of that,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
then the incidence of
cancer went up dramatically.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And now it's 1 out of 2.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's predicted
that, by the year 2020,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
everybody in their lifetime
will develop cancer.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.707 align:middle line:84%
So anybody watching
this, right now,

00:14:36.707 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
it's either you or
the person standing

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.873 align:middle line:84%
next to you who's
going to get cancer.

00:14:39.873 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:90%
So you'd better listen up.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I found out
this about outdoor air.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.545 align:middle line:84%
And I explain why this
happens on my videos.

00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:55.176 align:middle line:84%
I explain why the
outdoor air is so much

00:14:55.176 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:90%
better than the indoor air.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're living in an area
that does not have great air,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
outside air is still
better than inside air.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I got rid of all the
sugar and caffeine and all

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.635 align:middle line:84%
of the MSG and NutraSweet and
all of these damaging things

00:15:12.635 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:90%
that are in the diet.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And I ate only food in its
natural form, which I still do.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I also realized
that you have

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:90%
to have peace in your life.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it
starts in the heart.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And you have to learn
to forgive everyone

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
who's ever wronged you.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
They've done studies
at Stanford showing

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
the enormous significance
of forgiveness

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and how it changes your
vital signs, your heart

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
rate, your blood pressure, your
adrenalin production, and all

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
of that, when you harbor grudges
or you're angry at someone.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you cannot get well
from mental illness or physical

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
illness if you're holding
onto grudges or you're angry.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the medical
literature shows

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that 50% of all
heart attacks occur

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:90%
after an episode of anger.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't
get rid of that anger,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:90%
you cannot get well.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had been through a lot
of difficult things in my life.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I had been through a divorce
that was very unpleasant

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and the custody battle
for my children.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you knew
the circumstances,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
you would know I had a real
reason, in human terms,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:90%
to be angry.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:90%
But I had to let it go.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And unless you let it
go, you cannot get well.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:90%
So we've got proper nutrition.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Exercise is extremely important.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But when I was sick, I
couldn't exercise at all.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I could barely get out of
bed to go to the bathroom.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But as I started to get well,
then I started taking walks.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.924 align:middle line:84%
The first walk was
only about 20 yards.

00:16:38.924 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'd
really done something,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:84%
because I had been so emaciated
and bedridden for so long.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
exercising more and more.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But even after I got well
and I could work a full day

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and I had energy, it took
three years after that

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
before I got enough strength
that I could go to the gym,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
because I could do a
few exercises at home,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
but they would
wear me out a lot.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And it took three years
before I was strong enough

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to get up off the bench without
rolling over onto the floor

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
and pushing myself
up with my hands.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's a long, hard struggle.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
And it took me 18 months after
I got this whole 10-step plan

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
The plan is proper
nutrition, exercise-- water

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:90%
is extremely important.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
The body is 75% water,
the brain is 85% water.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's not 85% Coke or
Pepsi or any of those things,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:90%
not milk.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:90%
It's water.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And we lose 10 glasses of
water every day just by living.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't
replace those or if we

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
drink caffeine or caffeinated
soda or alcohol or any

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
of those things that
dehydrate our body,

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:90%
we will lose even more water.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I started drinking
huge amounts of water.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, things
started changing,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:84%
because I had symptoms
of many other diseases

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:90%
when I had cancer.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I had symptoms of Parkinson's.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I developed the pill-rolling
tremor of Parkinson's.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I had severe numbness in my left
leg, like multiple sclerosis.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I developed Renaud's phenomenon,
where the fingertips,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
they weren't getting
enough blood.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had horrible
anxiety and depression.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just
because I had cancer.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It was because the same
things-- I realized

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that all of these
things were caused

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
by the same lack of these 10
steps, which caused cancer.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
When I started doing the
plan, within eight months,

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:90%
all of my cancer was gone.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have nutrition, exercise,
water, sunlight, temperance,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
which is elimination
of all of these things

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that are in your diet and
that you want to get rid of,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and then rest-- the proper rest
at the proper time of night--

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.824 align:middle line:84%
because the healing
hormones are produced

00:18:57.824 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
between 10:00 PM and 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:90%
But you have to be asleep.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And so people think, well,
I can go to bed at 12:00

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and get up at 8:00.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We are meant, really, to
start slowing down and going

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
to bed when the sun goes down.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:90%
We are meant to do that.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we disobey
these rules-- you see,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
there are rules of this Earth,
such as the law of gravity.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you resist the law of
gravity, the law of gravity

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is still working whether
you like it or not.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you jump off
of a high building,

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:90%
you're going to go down.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't care whether you
don't like it or not.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
If you resist these 10
natural health laws,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get sick.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:84%
If you live within
them, you will be well.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So we've got proper rest at
the proper time of night.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:84%
The first eight are the
acronym NEW START-- nutrition,

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
exercise, water, sunlight,
temperance, fresh air,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
proper rest at the proper
time of night, trust in God.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.021 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there was--
we don't have within us--

00:19:58.021 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and I know there are
others who disagree--

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't have within us
the ability to get well.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the better you
eat and the better you live,

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:90%
the healthier you will be.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But if people don't have
an external standard,

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and if they do not trust
in God, eventually we

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
will run into things in
life that are too big for us

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and that we will go down.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
studying the Bible,

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
learning to trust God and
really give my troubles to him.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the last two steps
are an attitude of gratitude.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to be thankful
for what you've got.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I was bedridden
and when I was so sick

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was in so
much pain, I just

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
thanked the Lord
that I was alive

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and that I had the
possibility of getting well,

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
even though I didn't know
how, as long as I was alive.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
one is benevolence.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.207 align:middle line:84%
You have to get outside
yourself and help other people.

00:20:52.207 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I was bedridden, I
couldn't help anybody else.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But I could pray for others
and quit praying just

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for my own self to get well
and pray for other people.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get
outside of yourself

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and you stop
focusing only on you,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that is a necessary
part of getting well,

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
because everything
starts in the heart.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The actions that you take
have to start in your mind

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:90%
and in your heart.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
live your own way

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and defy all these
laws of natural health,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:90%
you will eventually get sick.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
When you're younger, you
may be able to put up

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.043 align:middle line:90%
with it for a while.

00:21:26.043 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, as you get
older, you will get sick.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:90%
So those are the basic steps.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice that they're
all free, except for food.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we grew our own food,
as we were meant to do,

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:90%
that would be free, too.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this plan is available
to everybody in the world.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:90%
But you have to do it.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work if you just
know about it and don't do it.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a plan that is
simple, but it is not easy,

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
because people do
not want to change

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
the way they're
living and eating.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have had friends who have
told me that they would rather

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
eat their hot fudge
sundaes or their hamburgers

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and die than to give
them up and stay alive.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.852 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's
everybody's right.

00:22:05.852 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>And it's not just
life and death.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:90%
It's quality of life.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.149 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.148 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, you have
many, many years

00:22:11.148 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:84%
on the decline in that context
of eating poorly and so forth.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But people say, well, I don't
want to live a long time anyway

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
in ill health.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can live a
long time and be healthy.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.795 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:22:23.795 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>And that's what I told you.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Today is my birthday.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.715 align:middle line:90%
I'm 69 years old today.

00:22:27.715 --> 00:22:29.673 align:middle line:84%
>>I was just going to
say, can we mention that?

00:22:29.673 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're unbelievable.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>And I can do everything I
did when I was 25 years old.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I
told someone that I

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:84%
have the same energy
that I had at 25.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:90%
And they were my age.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, come
on, that's really--

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and my husband said,
no, she's right.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:84%
She has the same energy that
she had when she was 25.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And I recently was remarried.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And my husband wanted to
eat and live like I did,

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:84%
because he said, I want to
have that kind of energy.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And so it does work.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:90%
You can be healthy.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I know people who are over 100
who eat and live like I do.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were just featured
in a big, national news piece,

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:90%
because one woman is 101.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
She does eight miles on an
exercise bicycle every day.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
She volunteers at
the local hospital.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.442 align:middle line:84%
And she does all
of these things.

00:23:25.442 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And she's totally well.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
She still drives her own car.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how
old you are if you feel well.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And the tragedy is
everybody can feel well

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
if they're just
willing to do it.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But we become so
addicted to food

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and so addicted to our lifestyle
and so addicted to anger.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:90%
People enjoy being angry.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
They have a real
feast of being angry.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But they don't realize that
the skeleton at the feast

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:84%
is them, because you eat
yourself up when you're angry.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>And that's what cancer does.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And so cancer is caused by the
way we eat and the way we live.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:84%
People go-- I look in
their shopping carts,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and I realize they're
putting cancer in there

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.337 align:middle line:84%
when they go home
and they eat it.

00:24:07.337 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And they give themselves cancer.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's not just
what you put in your mouth.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It's what you put in
your mind, as well.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
When I was getting well, I
didn't read the newspapers.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't listen to the radio.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't watch
television except for

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:90%
high-quality spiritual programs.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I only read the
Book-- the Bible,

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and high-quality
religious books.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I only listened
to classical music

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and high-quality
religious music, not

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
the music that's played in most
churches, which is ditties,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:90%
almost, now.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
to be very careful

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.682 align:middle line:84%
what you put in your
mind, as well as

00:24:45.682 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
what you put in your mouth,
when you're getting well.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out that you
change your lifestyle so much,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
you have no interest in
any of that other, as well.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>And what is the natural
age span of a human being?

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, they say that
it's, like, 70 years old.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
People talk about,
well, look, we're

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:84%
living longer than
we ever have before.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:90%
That is a lie of statistics.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
If a person got past the
childhood diseases that

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
were rampant because of
bad sanitation and all

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that in the early 1900s,
if they got past those,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
their life expectancy was just
as long as it is now or longer.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But with all these
people dying of cancer

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
they're juggling the
statistics to make

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
you think that
we're living longer.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not living longer.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:90%
They're lying.

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But they would like
you to think that,

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
because they want you
to still contribute

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:90%
to the funding of medicine.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>But let's say you're
raised in a healthy manner,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:84%
because you have
conscious parents.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And you basically are
living by these natural laws

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:90%
your entire life.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, shouldn't
the human being

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
extend at least to
100 years of age?

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't that be our
natural life span and beyond?

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yes.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That should be our natural
life span, at least.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we were originally
designed to live forever.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But as people started
living their own way,

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:84%
rather than God's way, the
life expectancy went way down.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, we certainly are
meant to live at least

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to be 100 and be healthy.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>And if people just would
take care of their bodies.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Except, when you talk about
people living healthfully,

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
there are some people
who live healthfully.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of health,
generally, in America

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:90%
is you read labels.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.144 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't read labels.

00:26:34.144 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't buy anything
with a label on it.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>And now the people say,
well, the soil is so deficient,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
so I've got to take all of
these man-made supplements.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way you
overcome that is you

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
eat organic food so you
don't have pesticides on it.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:90%
It's grown in healthier soil.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can overcome
it in two major ways.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Number one, drink a lot of
homemade fresh vegetable

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:84%
juice in between meals,
because that will give you

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:90%
huge amounts of nutrients.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And the other is to sprout
your beans, seeds, and grains,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:90%
rather than cook them.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And that will increase
their nutritional value up

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:90%
to 600% over cooked.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.182 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what the
raw food movement right now

00:27:16.182 --> 00:27:16.681 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Raw food movement.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.370 align:middle line:84%
The more raw food you can
eat, the better off you are.

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I did not get
well 100 years ago,

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
when the soil was
better than it is now.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:90%
I got well in the last 15 years.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>I was supposed to die in 1995.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>That's when I was
so terribly sick.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Just amazing.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>And I am so healthy.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, how do
you know you're cancer free?

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I had
a great big thing there.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And even though I had a
portion of it debulked,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.624 align:middle line:90%
they left most of it in.

00:27:48.624 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:90%
It was just for pain relief.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And they sent me home to die.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And now I've got a great
big depression right here.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can feel where
all of the soft tissue

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:05.291 align:middle line:90%
was pushed away by the tumor.

00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And I've got a big depression.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I've got nothing there.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, how do you know
when you're over the flu?

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
feel sick anymore.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>You feel better.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>People say, well, how
do you know you're well?

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I was so terribly sick.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.665 align:middle line:84%
I was so terribly
sick, and now I'm not.

00:28:22.665 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But most people, when they
have a tumor that size,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:90%
they go and have it removed.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So then how do you
follow your progress?

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.292 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:28:36.292 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't know if
what you're doing

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
is working if you've
had the tumor removed.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You need the tumor there to
show you, is it receding?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But doctors tell patients,
you can't do it that way.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:90%
We have to cut it out.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that
people have recurrences

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
is that they first of all have
chemotherapy and radiation,

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:84%
which destroys
your immune system.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:84%
You need your immune
system to get you well.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you have it destroyed
with the chemo and radiation,

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:84%
yes, it will destroy
the tumor for a time.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But it also destroys
your immune system.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And so then, the tumor
will always come back.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:90%
It will always come back.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If you have enough immune
system left to fight it,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:84%
you may survive for
some period of time

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:90%
or maybe for a long time.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But most people, or many
people, their immune systems

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
are so destroyed
by the treatment

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that, when the tumor
comes back, they

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
have nothing left
to fight it with.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Or they give them more
chemo and more radiation.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:90%
And then that kills them.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I've watched that happen
to so many people,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:84%
including friends of mine who
were too afraid to do what

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I did, because they wanted
to believe the white coats.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>And you are a white coat.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>I am a white coat.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And I know that white coats
don't know how to do this.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:90%
They say they do.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But that's because
we're taught that.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Doctors fear cancer
more than non-doctors,

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.100 align:middle line:84%
because the lay person
believes that they

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
can go to their doctor, and
their doctor can fix it.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:84%
The doctor knows
they can't fix it.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And doctors talk among
themselves about,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:84%
are we going to kill
the patient first,

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
or are we going
to kill the tumor?

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But you see, you can't
just really kill a tumor.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:84%
The body, as I said earlier,
is meant to heal itself.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.890 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do
is stop injuring it.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And we injure it by the way
we eat, the way we live.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:90%
This is all kind of trauma.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
If you took a hammer and
hit your thumb every day,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.650 align:middle line:90%
you'd make it into a hamburger.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't get well if
you kept hitting it every day.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got to stop
doing the things that

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:90%
cause the injury to the body.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
most people don't know.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the
doctors don't know.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:90%
We're never taught that.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Doctors have a shorter
life expectancy

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:90%
than the general population.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
higher suicide rate.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So why would you want to
go to them for your health?

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>And that brings up a whole
different line of questioning.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get back for
just a moment to the barley

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:15.189 align:middle line:84%
greens and also the beet
powder and how you utilize this

00:31:15.189 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and what the value--
because green is everywhere.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:84%
There are 1,000 green
powders out there right now.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there are a thousand
green powders out there.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:90%
I tried a number of them.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I found that, first of all, the
barley, the young barley plant,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most nutritious
foods in the world.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And I went with a
brand that had actually

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
been developed 25 years
ago, where they blow it dry,

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and it's not heated.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And it has a good consistency.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And it tasted good.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I would put it
in my carrot juice.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
You can put it in
any kind of juice.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And all it is is food.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything special.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:53.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not a panacea.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not a quick fix.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.110 align:middle line:90%
It's food.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But it is in a
concentrated form.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you do put it in your
juice or something like that,

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
it gives you the equivalent
of several servings

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of a very nutritious green
vegetable by doing it that way.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.140 align:middle line:90%
So I used it as an adjunct.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
use it to get well.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Beets are very nutritious.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you can use
some beet powder.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to use it sparingly,
because it's very cleansing.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And people have to use it
very sparingly to do it.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't use that, because
it wasn't available to me

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:90%
when I was getting well.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But I would use the fresh
juice, the fresh carrot juice

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and fresh green leafy
vegetable juice.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And those recipes
are in my workbook

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.260 align:middle line:84%
called "Getting Started
on Getting Well,"

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:84%
which is an adjunct
to my videos.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So, I have a nine-video
set on how to get well.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can start out
with "Cancer Doesn't

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Scare Me Anymore" and "You
Can't Improve on God."

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.515 align:middle line:84%
The video "You Can't
Improve on God"

00:32:56.515 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:84%
tells the exact plan
I used to get well.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Again, that is free.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And people say, oh, you know--
sometimes people accused me,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.470 align:middle line:90%
you just want to make money.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.301 align:middle line:90%
The video is $19.95.

00:33:07.301 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.216 align:middle line:84%
These are not
exorbitant in price.

00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>No. $19.95.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.565 align:middle line:84%
>>Nothing like chemotherapy,
radiation, et cetera.

00:33:11.565 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
My brother died of
cancer, because he

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
refused to do
anything that I did,

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.810 align:middle line:90%
because I was his little sister.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:90%
So he went to the doctors.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually killed
him with chemotherapy.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
chemotherapy drugs

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.339 align:middle line:84%
that he was taking that
cost $3,000 a treatment.

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't covered.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.005 align:middle line:84%
They were experimental,
so they weren't

00:33:31.005 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:90%
covered by his insurance.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
For $19.95, if a person
just got one video,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
"You Can't Improve
on God," and followed

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
that, they and
their family could

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.225 align:middle line:84%
be well for the rest of
their lives for under $20.

00:33:43.225 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, they think,
if it's inexpensive,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:90%
it can't possibly work.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole
plan is inexpensive.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I never went to a
doctor, ever, when

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I was going through my illness,
except for my biopsies.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had a
debulking, which means

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
they took out just a
portion of the tumor

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
just to give me some pain
relief to send me home to die.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the only things I had.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:84%
I never went to a
doctor regularly,

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because there's not
one single doctor who

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.030 align:middle line:84%
even claims to have
created a body.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I went to the great
physician who is God,

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him to show
me how to get well,

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:84%
because I knew he knew
what was wrong with my body

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and what I needed
to do to get well.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.004 align:middle line:84%
And he is available
to every individual.

00:34:34.004 --> 00:34:35.295 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to go someplace.

00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people will
write to me and say,

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I need a doctor who is
a specialist in, say,

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:84%
pancreatic cancer
who is in my area.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I've got
just the one for you.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:90%
I talked to him this morning.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:90%
He'll take care of you for free.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And he's available
to you all the time.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's the Lord.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, now, going
away from that

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
plan to a health
insurance type of plan,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:90%
a whole different kind of plan.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about really eliminates

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.510 align:middle line:84%
a large need for some of the
HMO type health insurance

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that's out there, because
so often, people think,

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
oh, my god, I have to
pay my $400 a month.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:90%
What if I get cancer?

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Or what if I got something else?

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>The only reason anybody
needs any insurance-- in fact,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:90%
I would eliminate insurance.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The doctor bills would go
way down if people-- there

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:90%
was no middle man.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And their whole
insurance industry

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
was set up as, really, a
sinister, clandestine plan

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to put a middleman in
between so people would not

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:84%
care as much at
how much it cost.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And so if people
just paid for it,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.570 align:middle line:84%
they would take better
care of their bodies,

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:84%
because they would
realize, I don't

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:90%
want to pay somebody to do this.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.070 align:middle line:84%
The only reason anybody would
need any kind of insurance

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:90%
is for trauma.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
If you get run over
by a truck, you

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.389 align:middle line:84%
need someone like me, who's
a trauma orthopedic surgeon,

00:35:54.389 --> 00:35:55.430 align:middle line:90%
to put you back together.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.971 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting you can drink
carrot juice and have your--

00:35:57.971 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Your leg set.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>--leg straightened out.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there
are three things

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:90%
that doctors are necessary for.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Number one is trauma.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Number two is
reconstruction, such

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.380 align:middle line:84%
if a child is born with a cleft
palate or something like that.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Then that is an
important thing to do.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then if someone
has-- well, now,

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:84%
if people would eat
right and live right,

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't develop arthritis.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But if they have
severe arthritis,

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.600 align:middle line:84%
reconstructive surgery for
a total hip or total knee

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:90%
is fine.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't the way
we were designed to be.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:84%
We were designed for our joints
to last all of our lives.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But if people haven't been
eating right and living right,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and they change, but
still, they're older.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So those are about
the only things

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:90%
that you would need a surgeon.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
take organs out.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
People have part
of their liver out

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and part of this out and part
of that out, their stomach.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
the way to do it.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Those things can all be healed.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And transplants of organs
are really very dangerous.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They were not designed to be
available for human beings

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:20.200 align:middle line:84%
because, in order for you
to get an organ, a kidney

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
or liver or anything
else from another person,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
before you get that, you have
to have your immune system wiped

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.590 align:middle line:84%
out, because the immune
system was built,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:84%
created in us by God, to resist
organs from another person.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in order for
you to accept one,

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have
all this chemotherapy.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, they call it
immunosuppressive therapy.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.420 align:middle line:90%
It suppresses the immune system.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly the same
drugs as chemotherapy.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And these people
have to be on them

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.310 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, frequently,
they will die of cancer,

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because they've been
taking chemotherapy

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
all along to suppress the body's
natural immune system to reject

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:90%
that organ.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very dangerous thing.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would encourage people,
why don't you heal your body,

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.790 align:middle line:84%
heal your kidney,
heal your liver.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to heal.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And people don't want
to do, unfortunately,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:90%
what is necessary.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's so much better life.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any arthritis.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't take any pills.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
fatigue syndrome.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And here I am getting
close to 70 years old,

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just as healthy
as I was when I was 25.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.970 align:middle line:90%
So why not live that way?

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:39.955 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:38:39.955 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.400 align:middle line:84%

who is watching this interview
some inspiration to take

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
your healing into your
own hands in partnership

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.490 align:middle line:84%
with whichever beliefs
work best for you.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.
