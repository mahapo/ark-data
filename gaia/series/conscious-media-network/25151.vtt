00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:07.893
<v ->I've been following the issue of chemtrails</v>

2
00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:09.697
for more than a decade now, and have seen

3
00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:12.895
little progress toward public disclosure of the phenomena.

4
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.845
We can see them, we've read about them,

5
00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:16.671
we debate them with friends and family,

6
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:19.069
but there's still no official explanation.

7
00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:20.851
So I seized the opportunity to speak with

8
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:22.919
G. Edward Griffin of Reality Zone

9
00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.625
and Unfiltered News about the chemtrails.

10
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.231
About what we need to know about them,

11
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:29.043
and what we can do about them.

12
00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:33.457
I'm so glad we finally had a chance to meet, Ed.

13
00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:36.515
I've been a fan of your site for a long time now,

14
00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:38.869
and we actually repost a lot of your stuff,

15
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:40.145
just so you know that.

16
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.157
<v ->That's good, thank you.</v>

17
00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:43.203
<v Voiceover>And you can talk to a variety</v>

18
00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:44.655
of subjects, of course you're very, very

19
00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.525
well known with your work regarding

20
00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.622
the Federal Reserve and cancer.

21
00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:50.646
Another thing you've come out with recently

22
00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:52.604
has been on chemtrails, and I have

23
00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.310
waited six years now to talk with

24
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.554
someone on camera about chemtrails.

25
00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.265
I was studying it myself in some depth,

26
00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:02.915
because we were being heavily sprayed

27
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.785
when I lived in Sedona, Arizona,

28
00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:08.525
and kept running into one roadblock after another,

29
00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.923
and I ended up waiting until I could

30
00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:12.551
talk to someone credible on it.

31
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.783
<v ->Well, thank you.</v>

32
00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:15.939
It's a very important topic, isn't it?

33
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.073
<v Voiceover>It is, and so first of all,</v>

34
00:01:18.073 --> 00:01:20.757
for anyone who is not already clear on what these

35
00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:22.869
things are, just go ahead and give your best

36
00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.145
description of them, and then we'll

37
00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.807
start going into the composition,

38
00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:28.707
the politics, and everything else.

39
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.215
<v ->Well that's quite a path.</v>

40
00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:32.989
It's really not so complicated.

41
00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.739
The fact of the matter is that we are being sprayed.

42
00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:38.005
And that's very hard to get past that first

43
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.227
most observable fact, because a lot of people

44
00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:45.067
cannot believe that someone, whoever that is,

45
00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:48.983
would be spraying the population without

46
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.457
notifying everybody.

47
00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:52.481
And they say, "Oh, what is this, a conspiracy theory?"

48
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:55.825
Or something like that, so that you've got this block,

49
00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:59.947
this barrier that just seems to be incredible.

50
00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:02.623
But the fact is that we can prove it very easily

51
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.571
that they are spraying us, so the question really is

52
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:07.683
what are they spraying on us, and why?

53
00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:09.443
Those are the only real issues.

54
00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:13.777
Now, we have to first, any documentary,

55
00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:15.647
or report on this topic proves that they

56
00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:18.177
are, in fact, spraying.

57
00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:21.895
So, I think that the first thing that people need

58
00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:25.217
to get clear, what I had to get clear in my mind first,

59
00:02:25.217 --> 00:02:27.461
is that, are you sure that this isn't just

60
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:29.067
plain old contrails?

61
00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.003
That's the thing you hear quite often.

62
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:32.411
Oh, don't worry about it.

63
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:34.369
It's just a natural phenomenon.

64
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.691
It's just the water vapor coming out of the

65
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.749
engine so super hot, and then it gets into

66
00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.587
the cold temperatures and it turns into ice crystals,

67
00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:45.061
and that's what you see.

68
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.755
And that's all we're looking at, they say,

69
00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:48.867
so don't get worried about it.

70
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.947
So the first thing I had to do is to say, is this true?

71
00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:56.807
Well, it is true that there are such things as contrails,

72
00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:59.638
and what they say is true about how they form

73
00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.303
and so forth, but that's where the reality stops,

74
00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:05.758
because what you see in the sky is, in many cases

75
00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:09.238
today, is not a contrail at all,

76
00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:12.190
because a contrail is pretty easy to identify.

77
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.966
First of all, it leaves the plane, if it's coming

78
00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:20.135
out of the engine, which true contrails are,

79
00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:21.862
it leaves the plane and it doesn't really

80
00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:25.006
form into ice crystals until it's traveled

81
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.854
a little distance, because it's super hot

82
00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:28.943
when it comes out, so it takes a moment,

83
00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:32.110
a second or two, for it to get frozen in those

84
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.990
super cold temperatures at the high elevation.

85
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.150
So what you see typically is this little

86
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.998
gap following the engines, and then

87
00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:40.822
you see the billow of smoke,

88
00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:44.182
then what you see is that smoke or that vapor trail

89
00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.542
dissipates, it's absorbed into the atmosphere,

90
00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:50.110
in particular into the higher atmosphere.

91
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.694
<v Voiceover>It looks like a matchstick.</v>

92
00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:53.518
<v ->Yeah it just follows along the plane.</v>

93
00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:55.103
<v ->Yeah, little matchstick.</v>

94
00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.423
<v ->And it's a natural phenomenon because</v>

95
00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.470
at the higher atmosphere, there's very little moisture.

96
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.708
The water is heavy and it tends to go down,

97
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.776
so the higher you go the less moisture you have.

98
00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:07.916
And for these things to exist, you have to have moisture.

99
00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:09.989
The moisture comes out of the engine at first,

100
00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.041
but then it dissipates and it's rapidly absorbed

101
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:15.841
into the dry air and then it disappears.

102
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.193
A true contrail, and you can see them, they

103
00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:20.489
just follow along right after the plane

104
00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.261
and how far it follows, it's hard to say,

105
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:25.473
but generally I'd say about a half a mile.

106
00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:26.621
Or less.

107
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.021
<v ->From our view, it's quite short.</v>

108
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:29.755
<v ->Just a little thing and it follows the plane.</v>

109
00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:33.060
But the chemtrails are something entirely different.

110
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.169
For one thing, in many cases we have video evidence

111
00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.660
of it's not coming from the engines at all.

112
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.096
It's coming from somewhere else on the plane.

113
00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:43.225
Sometimes it appears to be the fuselage,

114
00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:46.052
sometimes it appears to be off the surfaces of the wings,

115
00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.480
and so forth.

116
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.852
And of course the naysayers say,

117
00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:50.532
"Well if it comes off of the surfaces of the wings

118
00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:53.389
"it's probably a vortex or something like that."

119
00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.504
So they've always got some rational plausible denial.

120
00:04:57.504 --> 00:04:59.353
I might comment on that now because

121
00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:01.481
some of your viewers are gonna hear this.

122
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:03.020
It's just a vortex.

123
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.436
It's true when planes are coming in at a steep dive

124
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.956
and they change directions or there's a

125
00:05:08.956 --> 00:05:11.616
if a plane is going through the sound barrier

126
00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:13.268
you can see the puff of smoke,

127
00:05:13.268 --> 00:05:16.768
'cause the compression of the air travel is so great

128
00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:19.849
it literally squeezes the moisture out of the air.

129
00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.228
You see this puff of cloud.

130
00:05:22.228 --> 00:05:25.112
But this is only under conditions of high performance

131
00:05:25.112 --> 00:05:27.716
where there's great deal of stress on the wings

132
00:05:27.716 --> 00:05:28.920
on the planes.

133
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.928
These planes are just flying along,

134
00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.244
there's no vortex at all there.

135
00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:33.680
You gotta get clear in your mind as to what

136
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.957
causes a true contrail before you can really make

137
00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:38.049
a judgment.

138
00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:39.925
So I think the people are trying to hide this.

139
00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:42.361
I don't say that easily.

140
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:44.041
I think they are trying to hide it.

141
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:46.841
They like to play upon people's lack of knowledge

142
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.360
of what the real phenomenon is.

143
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.516
The point is that there are such things

144
00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:54.064
as real contrails, but what we're looking at

145
00:05:54.064 --> 00:05:56.080
and what we're worried about today is

146
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.201
something entirely different.

147
00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:00.644
This comes out and it doesn't dissipate.

148
00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:02.688
And disappear into the atmosphere.

149
00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:04.424
It doesn't follow along and disappear.

150
00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:08.232
This goes from plane to horizon, horizon to horizon.

151
00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:12.404
And billows out and you get pass after pass after pass.

152
00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:14.169
And then sometimes they come at right angles

153
00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.680
and 45 degree angles.

154
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.661
<v ->It's like tic tac toe.</v>

155
00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:18.788
<v ->It's like tic tac toe and they're covering the sky.</v>

156
00:06:18.788 --> 00:06:21.281
These are not normal flight patterns, by the way.

157
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:24.388
If you can get airline maps you see this plane

158
00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:25.844
goes here, that one goes there,

159
00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.468
and when you look up, those are not

160
00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:28.841
regular flight patterns.

161
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:30.437
These are not.

162
00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:31.305
<v ->Right.</v>

163
00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:34.749
<v ->And you know, these big planes have to follow highways.</v>

164
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:36.373
It's just like driving a car.

165
00:06:36.373 --> 00:06:40.405
The air controllers give them a certain highway to follow

166
00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:42.112
and if it's east to west it's on this track,

167
00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:44.212
if it's north to south it's on this track.

168
00:06:44.212 --> 00:06:46.088
So you can't just fly all over the sky,

169
00:06:46.088 --> 00:06:47.376
unless you're military.

170
00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:48.972
Okay.

171
00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:51.604
That tells you something right there.

172
00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:55.036
We know that they're spraying something,

173
00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:57.304
and the question is why and what?

174
00:06:57.304 --> 00:07:00.916
I think the best way to answer that

175
00:07:00.916 --> 00:07:05.394
is to first think why would they want to?

176
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.869
It's not hard to find a rationale for doing that

177
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:11.669
because for some time now, there have been a group

178
00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.225
of people, mostly scientists and engineers

179
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:18.893
talking about the need to alter the atmosphere

180
00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:19.816
of the planet.

181
00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:22.252
They call it geo-engineering.

182
00:07:22.252 --> 00:07:24.520
They want to engineer the planet,

183
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.620
they want to change it from its natural state

184
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.980
to something that they think in their insanity

185
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.577
they think they're going to improve on it.

186
00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:32.697
They wanna change the weather.

187
00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:34.321
They wanna stop global warming.

188
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.129
Or they want to direct hurricanes away from cities

189
00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:41.769
or they're going to cause rain to increase the crop

190
00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:43.784
performance.

191
00:07:43.784 --> 00:07:44.905
All this stuff.

192
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:46.780
They always have a good reason.

193
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.161
I believe that the real reason has nothing to do

194
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:52.016
with these humanitarian objectives.

195
00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:54.229
But nevertheless, they have an explanation

196
00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.329
that seems plausible if you don't want to be

197
00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.065
questioning about it.

198
00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:01.397
But it all boils down to the fact that they're talking about

199
00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.785
the great advantage of spraying in the atmosphere.

200
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.409
And they say, what should we spray in order

201
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:09.740
to reflect the heat from the sun and all these things?

202
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.513
They say, aluminum would be good.

203
00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:13.661
Barium would be good.

204
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.780
Strontium would be good.

205
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.600
They tell you what chemicals they have researched

206
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.868
and they think should be sprayed.

207
00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:19.680
(laughs)

208
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.436
Okay.

209
00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:22.620
They always talk about it as though maybe someday

210
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.357
we're going to do it, you know?

211
00:08:24.357 --> 00:08:28.165
What they're really doing is creating the sales script

212
00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:30.069
to convince the people that it's a good idea

213
00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:32.113
so that when they finally find out that this has

214
00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:35.249
been going on for a long time, well that's good.

215
00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.209
Truth of the matter is it has been going on

216
00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:38.665
for a long time.

217
00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:41.912
<v ->Insert right here, how long to your knowledge</v>

218
00:08:41.912 --> 00:08:43.088
has this been going on?

219
00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:44.880
<v ->To my knowledge, there's one thing</v>

220
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.812
but the evidence that I've seen

221
00:08:46.812 --> 00:08:48.129
is been going on for about 20 years.

222
00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:50.145
I have not been aware of it for 20 years.

223
00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:54.569
I've been aware of it for about maybe 14, 15 years

224
00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:55.885
something like that.

225
00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:59.273
I do believe it didn't start full-blown, you know.

226
00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:01.401
It takes a lot of airplanes, a lot of tankers,

227
00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:04.984
a big operation, so it probably started slow

228
00:09:04.984 --> 00:09:06.468
and ramped up.

229
00:09:06.468 --> 00:09:10.165
It looks like it's been going on for about 20 years now.

230
00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:13.217
<v ->What's interesting is that</v>

231
00:09:13.217 --> 00:09:14.897
in putting a time date on it,

232
00:09:14.897 --> 00:09:18.005
is even looking at films, like old films,

233
00:09:18.005 --> 00:09:20.217
you'll see films from the 50s, 60s, 70s,

234
00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:21.896
you never see this in the sky.

235
00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:26.516
But again, like you say, maybe 15 years ago, 10 years ago,

236
00:09:26.516 --> 00:09:29.708
you started seeing noticeable chemtrails in the scenes

237
00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:31.500
in Hollywood films.

238
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.328
<v ->And we have some interesting clips in our</v>

239
00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:36.989
collection, we're going to put it in the documentary

240
00:09:36.989 --> 00:09:39.648
and decided not to do so mainly because

241
00:09:39.648 --> 00:09:42.280
we didn't want the documentary to be too long.

242
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.548
But there are some classic movies

243
00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:46.870
that go back to much longer than this.

244
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.962
I don't know the date.

245
00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.874
But there are even black and white movies, you know.

246
00:09:50.874 --> 00:09:52.889
You look at the colorized version.

247
00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:56.529
You know they've been digitally enhanced.

248
00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.910
And they've got chemtrails.

249
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.389
But you look at the original version, no chemtrails.

250
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:06.218
They have actually added chemtrails--

251
00:10:06.218 --> 00:10:08.682
<v ->To make you think it's been there consistency.</v>

252
00:10:08.682 --> 00:10:11.314
Oh, no, that's funny.
<v ->Isn't this incredible?</v>

253
00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:14.814
It's draconian.
<v ->It's not right.</v>

254
00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.186
It's draconian, it's not right.

255
00:10:16.186 --> 00:10:17.866
<v ->It's incredible.
<v ->Oh my god.</v>

256
00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:19.125
Really?

257
00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.141
<v ->It really gets bizarre, you think you've fallen</v>

258
00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:22.318
down the rabbit hole.

259
00:10:22.318 --> 00:10:23.465
<v ->I've never heard that one.</v>

260
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:24.950
I thought I'd heard a lot of it, but not that one.

261
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.042
<v ->Yeah.</v>

262
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.029
It's a big story.

263
00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:29.822
Anyway, little bit off the track.

264
00:10:29.822 --> 00:10:34.162
So they're talking about having to spray aluminum

265
00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:36.401
primarily, and barium and strontium,

266
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:39.005
to bring about these wonderful effects that they

267
00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.834
say we should have to improve the planet.

268
00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:43.401
To engineer the planet.

269
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:46.398
Now we fast forward to a few years ago

270
00:10:46.398 --> 00:10:48.637
when we started to do our own research.

271
00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:51.241
We decided to do samples of the water

272
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:53.006
and of the snow.

273
00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:54.854
See what's in this stuff.

274
00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:59.192
Wouldn't you know, aluminum, barium, and strontium.

275
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.273
And exceedingly high concentrations.

276
00:11:02.273 --> 00:11:04.793
It is true that aluminum is a very ubiquitous

277
00:11:04.793 --> 00:11:06.473
element in the earth.

278
00:11:06.473 --> 00:11:08.041
Aluminum is everywhere.

279
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:09.637
But not in the form they're finding it.

280
00:11:09.637 --> 00:11:12.213
Aluminum goes in combination.

281
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.565
Aluminum oxide, aluminum this and that that thing.

282
00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:17.962
They way they're finding it now in the snow,

283
00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:21.631
this isn't the soil, the snow, means it came from the sky.

284
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:25.691
Is huge quantities, in fact they did a sample

285
00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:27.930
at Mount Shasta, you may remember that was

286
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.583
in film.

287
00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:31.851
Mount Shasta is a remote pristine area

288
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:36.219
of Northern California, there is no industrial activity

289
00:11:36.219 --> 00:11:39.410
within hundreds of miles, they've already determined that

290
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.658
the pollution is not coming from Japan across the ocean.

291
00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:44.450
All of the things that the naysayers would say,

292
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.495
"Well probaby from that."

293
00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:48.706
None of those things are applicable and yet

294
00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:52.234
the concentration of aluminum in the snow

295
00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:54.279
up on Mount Shasta compared to what it was

296
00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.043
20 years ago, because they have the readings

297
00:11:56.043 --> 00:11:58.507
from 20 years ago, zero 20 years ago.

298
00:11:58.507 --> 00:12:03.507
Now it's like 6000 times higher than what is safe to drink.

299
00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:06.430
Up at the top of Mount Shasta.

300
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.754
It has to come from the sky, missy.

301
00:12:08.754 --> 00:12:10.043
<v ->And this what we're breathing in.</v>

302
00:12:10.043 --> 00:12:12.143
<v ->And that's what we're breathing, that's what we're</v>

303
00:12:12.143 --> 00:12:14.047
getting in the water.
<v ->In the food.</v>

304
00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:17.042
<v ->Water melts, where does the Mount Shasta snow go?</v>

305
00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:19.143
Goes down into Sacramento River,

306
00:12:19.143 --> 00:12:21.187
goes down, a lot of people got their drinking water,

307
00:12:21.187 --> 00:12:22.363
and so forth.

308
00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:23.595
<v ->Talking about that fish population.</v>

309
00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:25.751
<v ->Fish population, what happened to those poor fish?</v>

310
00:12:27.051 --> 00:12:28.893
They're getting poisoned.

311
00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:30.825
But now we're getting ahead of the story

312
00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:32.309
as to the consequences of this.

313
00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:34.017
The first thing we have to do is be sure that

314
00:12:34.017 --> 00:12:35.082
are they spraying?

315
00:12:35.082 --> 00:12:36.258
And yes, they are spraying!

316
00:12:36.258 --> 00:12:37.686
We know what they're spraying.

317
00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:40.150
Aluminum, barium and strontium.

318
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.950
There may be other things that we haven't looked at.

319
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.770
I suspect there might be other things,

320
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.478
but we haven't gotten there yet.

321
00:12:46.478 --> 00:12:49.275
Maybe with further research we can do that.

322
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:52.525
And then you finally come to the really bad question.

323
00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:55.351
Why are they doing it?

324
00:12:55.606 --> 00:12:58.152
Their answer is that they're doing it for us.

325
00:12:58.265 --> 00:12:59.497
They're the good guys, you see.

326
00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:01.821
They're trying to stop global warming.

327
00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:03.221
<v ->And service to humanity.</v>

328
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:05.350
<v ->And service to humanity, exactly.</v>

329
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.086
Well I know this isn't the place to go into

330
00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:09.102
the global warming myth as I call it,

331
00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:11.734
but just for the record, I don't think it's real.

332
00:13:11.734 --> 00:13:14.058
I think it's all a manufactured scare thing

333
00:13:14.058 --> 00:13:18.145
to convince people to accept carbon trading

334
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:22.066
and all this taxation and government regulations.

335
00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:23.549
Scare us into that.

336
00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:26.125
Nevertheless, even if you grant that there

337
00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:28.142
is global warming, and even if you believe that

338
00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:31.530
that is something that's a danger to the planet,

339
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.602
the cure is much worse.

340
00:13:33.602 --> 00:13:38.222
Their cure of spraying all this toxic stuff on us

341
00:13:38.222 --> 00:13:40.853
it's not only ruining the planet,

342
00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:44.494
it's killing plant life, it's changing the soil alkalinity,

343
00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:45.921
it's making it too alkaline.

344
00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:50.038
The plants in the Western hemisphere

345
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.885
like acidic soils.

346
00:13:51.885 --> 00:13:54.462
All of our crops like acidic soils.

347
00:13:54.462 --> 00:13:56.842
The forests like acidic soils.

348
00:13:56.842 --> 00:13:58.914
There are parts of the world where that's not true,

349
00:13:58.914 --> 00:14:00.174
they're more alkaline.

350
00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:02.750
But in this part of the world, all acidic.

351
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.698
Those soils are gradually being shifted

352
00:14:06.698 --> 00:14:10.114
so they're less and less acidic and more and more alkaline.

353
00:14:10.114 --> 00:14:12.214
Crops are beginning to suffer from that.

354
00:14:12.214 --> 00:14:13.614
Trees are beginning to die.

355
00:14:13.614 --> 00:14:14.650
<v ->I was just going to ask you, yes.</v>

356
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.498
<v ->So they're ruining the planet</v>

357
00:14:16.498 --> 00:14:18.458
and it's also getting into the water.

358
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.614
The fish are not surviving.

359
00:14:20.614 --> 00:14:24.870
It's killing the little microorganisms that the fish eat.

360
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.194
And therefore the fish are not eating enough,

361
00:14:27.194 --> 00:14:28.314
they're starving.

362
00:14:28.314 --> 00:14:29.770
We've got all of this documented.

363
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.534
It's killing the fish supply.

364
00:14:31.534 --> 00:14:34.698
It's going up the food chain, in other words.

365
00:14:34.698 --> 00:14:36.910
We're of course at the top of the food chain.

366
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.317
And it will have a profound effect on us.

367
00:14:39.317 --> 00:14:41.530
<v ->Let's talk about of the known effects of aluminum,</v>

368
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.545
barium, strontium on the human body.

369
00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:45.982
<v ->I think everyone knows by now that aluminum</v>

370
00:14:45.982 --> 00:14:50.237
is the main culprit here, is a major factor in Alzheimer's

371
00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:51.525
disease.

372
00:14:51.525 --> 00:14:54.970
Aluminum gets into the neurons and it

373
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.134
as I've come to understand it, it's kind of

374
00:14:58.134 --> 00:15:00.738
the layman's understanding, but nevertheless makes sense,

375
00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:04.937
is that it gets into the synapses in the nerve endings

376
00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:06.673
and tends to short them out.

377
00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:10.622
So the primary effect is on neurons in the brain

378
00:15:10.622 --> 00:15:13.001
and in the body elsewhere.

379
00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:16.473
Sensations and memory and that kind of thing.

380
00:15:16.473 --> 00:15:20.338
It also has an impact along with barium and strontium,

381
00:15:20.338 --> 00:15:22.830
a negative impact on the immune system.

382
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.274
If your immune system is depressed,

383
00:15:26.274 --> 00:15:29.214
you're open to all kinds of diseases.

384
00:15:29.214 --> 00:15:31.622
You're open to asthma, you're open to pneumonia,

385
00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:34.422
you're open to just about anything that can

386
00:15:34.422 --> 00:15:35.849
attack the human body.

387
00:15:35.849 --> 00:15:37.726
Without the immune system to defend it,

388
00:15:37.726 --> 00:15:39.238
you're susceptible to it.

389
00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:42.766
So you see a very sharp rise in these

390
00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:46.714
immune deficiency conditions in areas

391
00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:48.898
that are getting heavily sprayed.

392
00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:53.769
<v ->We had a doctor in Sedona whom I've also interviewed</v>

393
00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:56.793
who talks about what happens to his practice

394
00:15:56.793 --> 00:15:59.230
on the heavy spray days and heavy spray weeks.

395
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.377
In Sedona.

396
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.646
Because there you have, people move there because

397
00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:06.062
of obviously cobalt blue skies, and of course

398
00:16:06.062 --> 00:16:08.162
they start spraying in the morning.

399
00:16:08.162 --> 00:16:10.738
By the afternoon, you have a gray overcast day.

400
00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:13.846
But on those days and those weeks where they spray,

401
00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:17.849
his practice is overflowing with people with

402
00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:19.641
upper respiratory problems.

403
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:21.125
<v ->I'm not surprised.</v>

404
00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:22.609
We ran into that too.

405
00:16:22.609 --> 00:16:24.345
I'd be very interested in talking to this very--

406
00:16:24.345 --> 00:16:25.158
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

407
00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:26.390
<v ->This same doctor if I could because</v>

408
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.190
we're going to do a follow up and that's

409
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.158
the kind of thing we need is more evidence.

410
00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:36.050
People say you didn't prove your case.

411
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.730
Well what is proof?

412
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.858
There's no such thing as absolute proof.

413
00:16:39.858 --> 00:16:41.958
There's only such thing as evidence.

414
00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.058
That might be that this piece of evidence

415
00:16:44.058 --> 00:16:46.074
and that piece of evidence and this piece of evidence

416
00:16:46.074 --> 00:16:47.810
all added together would convince me that

417
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.490
such and such is true.

418
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.282
Therefore it's proved to me.

419
00:16:51.282 --> 00:16:53.494
But for you you might say I'm not convinced by that.

420
00:16:53.494 --> 00:16:55.538
You need another piece of evidence and another piece.

421
00:16:55.538 --> 00:16:56.966
And then it's proved to you.

422
00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:58.786
So proof is a relative thing.

423
00:16:58.786 --> 00:17:01.333
It's only the evidence that's sufficient to convince

424
00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.350
a person that something is true.

425
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.010
A lot of people find this so hard to believe,

426
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.129
that they're resisting and they say,

427
00:17:07.129 --> 00:17:08.642
"Well there must be a different reason,

428
00:17:08.642 --> 00:17:10.546
"so you haven't proved it yet."

429
00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:13.122
So we're gonna go back and keep getting the evidence

430
00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:16.817
til finally anybody, even the most die hard skeptic,

431
00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:19.701
has got to say, "Okay, that's an open and shut case."

432
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:24.543
<v ->Anecdotal evidence or not, his practice is booming.</v>

433
00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:28.827
Unhappily so, with people throughout these spray periods.

434
00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:30.313
It's consistent.

435
00:17:30.313 --> 00:17:31.994
So I'll get you in touch with him

436
00:17:31.994 --> 00:17:33.338
as a matter of fact
<v ->Thank you, I'd like that.</v>

437
00:17:33.338 --> 00:17:34.850
We all had the experiences with our friends.

438
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.902
I was just visiting a fellow from north of us

439
00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:41.122
by about 200 miles, he lives in the country.

440
00:17:41.122 --> 00:17:45.377
But they're spraying out there in this farmland area.

441
00:17:45.377 --> 00:17:47.477
So you know it's not just to reach the population.

442
00:17:47.477 --> 00:17:49.130
They're trying to change the planet.

443
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.734
And he says, "I and everybody else out there,

444
00:17:51.734 --> 00:17:54.030
"we've all these respiratory conditions

445
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.354
"always right after they're spraying."

446
00:17:56.354 --> 00:17:59.490
So I think by now most people probably have either

447
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.682
that personal experience or they know someone who has.

448
00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:03.857
<v ->Right. So we can look to that.</v>

449
00:18:03.857 --> 00:18:07.581
And also, this is anecdotal, we have to take it as hearsay,

450
00:18:07.581 --> 00:18:08.785
but it's another interview we--

451
00:18:08.785 --> 00:18:10.942
I will not mention this is way before we

452
00:18:10.942 --> 00:18:14.834
even started CMN, was following this with another

453
00:18:14.834 --> 00:18:17.997
Project Paperclip physicist.

454
00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:19.482
They were capturing samples.

455
00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:22.141
The physicists had a lab and he was analyzing them

456
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:24.073
and he said not only was there the aluminum

457
00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:25.949
and barium in there but there are also bacterial

458
00:18:25.949 --> 00:18:29.729
components and tuberculosis was one of them they found.

459
00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:32.529
<v ->See, that blows your mind, doesn't it?</v>

460
00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:35.722
Why they can't even claim this is for the betterment

461
00:18:35.722 --> 00:18:39.614
of humanity if they're putting a bacteria

462
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.873
and protein that is toxic to human function

463
00:18:45.873 --> 00:18:46.992
into these things.

464
00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:48.672
There's no defense for that.

465
00:18:48.672 --> 00:18:53.262
If that's true, we're in big trouble.

466
00:18:53.321 --> 00:18:54.188
<v ->Yes.</v>

467
00:18:54.188 --> 00:18:58.501
And it's a very hard subject to get real information on

468
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:00.937
because it's certainly suppressed and denied.

469
00:19:00.937 --> 00:19:04.549
I think I told you off camera that I was hunting

470
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:07.349
this information down the best I could as a lone

471
00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:09.996
investigative reporter before there were a lot of networks

472
00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:10.836
for this stuff.

473
00:19:10.836 --> 00:19:12.096
About 10 years ago.

474
00:19:12.096 --> 00:19:15.596
And I got as high as the public information officer

475
00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:20.412
for the FAA in this region, the southwestern region of

476
00:19:20.412 --> 00:19:22.820
the United States.

477
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.620
Located in Los Angeles area.

478
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.112
And I said, "I keep calling all these people,"

479
00:19:28.112 --> 00:19:30.409
and number one, the one thing I found right away

480
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:33.460
was it could be flying right over my head

481
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.745
but none of the local airports could report of

482
00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:41.636
its flight pattern or its numbers or what that plane was.

483
00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:43.373
They said, "Well, we don't have any, no,

484
00:19:43.373 --> 00:19:45.528
"There's nothing overhead right now."

485
00:19:45.528 --> 00:19:47.069
And I'd call and I knew the guy

486
00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:48.972
that ran the local airport even.

487
00:19:48.972 --> 00:19:50.148
No. Uh-uh.

488
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:52.360
And this happened region by region.

489
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.084
I'd get numbers on humidity factors

490
00:19:56.084 --> 00:19:58.268
at upper elevations and altitudes and such--

491
00:19:58.268 --> 00:19:59.193
<v ->Wow, good for you.</v>

492
00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:01.600
<v ->I did all that kinda stuff and it kept coming back,</v>

493
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.269
no, uh-uh, meterological people, no such thing,

494
00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:06.557
oh that's a myth.

495
00:20:06.557 --> 00:20:07.649
And so finally--
<v ->And you're looking</v>

496
00:20:07.649 --> 00:20:08.545
at the plane right there.

497
00:20:08.545 --> 00:20:10.421
<v ->I'm watching the plane go over my house.</v>

498
00:20:10.421 --> 00:20:12.325
And chemtrails all over.

499
00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:14.648
I finally got through to the man at the FAA,

500
00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:16.217
as I told you I'm saying this on camera so

501
00:20:16.217 --> 00:20:17.280
other people know it.

502
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.696
I said, "Will no one give me any information regarding

503
00:20:20.696 --> 00:20:22.936
"this because it's a military operation?

504
00:20:22.936 --> 00:20:25.064
"Might that be why you can't tell me that

505
00:20:25.064 --> 00:20:26.352
"that plane flew over my house?"

506
00:20:26.352 --> 00:20:30.382
And he said, "Yes. End of discussion."

507
00:20:30.496 --> 00:20:31.841
That's the only time--

508
00:20:31.841 --> 00:20:35.899
And you said, "Did you record it?"

509
00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:38.813
No, I did not record it, it's just my word.

510
00:20:38.813 --> 00:20:42.061
But I was absolutely shocked that I even got that.

511
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:43.685
But if he thought he was being recorded,

512
00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:46.008
you can't lie as a public information officer,

513
00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:47.100
theoretically.

514
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.537
And at least he said that much.

515
00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:51.412
Now that was something.

516
00:20:51.412 --> 00:20:53.793
To me that was really crystal clear at that time.

517
00:20:53.793 --> 00:20:55.865
What have you gone through on that same journey

518
00:20:55.865 --> 00:20:58.217
where you've been repeatedly blocked

519
00:20:58.217 --> 00:20:59.785
in getting information?

520
00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:02.695
Or what have you gotten on that same journey?

521
00:21:03.313 --> 00:21:05.497
<v ->I have not had anything like that</v>

522
00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:08.660
where people have stonewalled it or lied

523
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.032
or even admitted the truth,

524
00:21:10.032 --> 00:21:14.372
because at my end of this project,

525
00:21:14.372 --> 00:21:17.284
I had people in the field doing that, you see.

526
00:21:17.284 --> 00:21:20.056
I was sort of the grandfather sitting back there tailing.

527
00:21:20.056 --> 00:21:21.876
We'll do this and we'll do that and look out for this

528
00:21:21.876 --> 00:21:22.688
and so forth.

529
00:21:22.688 --> 00:21:25.713
So I had the easy part while the fellows out in the field

530
00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:30.053
were butting up against the officials and the Congressmen

531
00:21:30.053 --> 00:21:32.292
and all the political naysayers and so forth.

532
00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.944
So I didn't have that experience,

533
00:21:33.944 --> 00:21:36.520
but I know that they did.

534
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.600
<v ->I was present when Dennis Kucinich announced</v>

535
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.064
he was running for President, his Presidency the first time

536
00:21:42.064 --> 00:21:44.025
it was at the Marin Civic Center.

537
00:21:44.025 --> 00:21:48.729
After his speech, one of the people in the audience said,

538
00:21:48.729 --> 00:21:51.081
"You just eliminated chemtrails from your ban

539
00:21:51.081 --> 00:21:54.047
"on space-space weapons."

540
00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.056
That was a big deal.

541
00:21:55.056 --> 00:21:58.388
Everyone on this issue was rallying behind Kucinich,

542
00:21:58.388 --> 00:22:01.411
who I considered to be a very honest good man.

543
00:22:01.804 --> 00:22:05.921
However, he said very simply, "If I didn't take it out,

544
00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:08.637
"it was going to take everything down with it.

545
00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:10.317
"I didn't have a choice."

546
00:22:10.317 --> 00:22:11.437
Again, "Next."

547
00:22:11.437 --> 00:22:14.740
Would not elaborate any more on the question.

548
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.317
<v ->So what he really said is that the powers that be</v>

549
00:22:17.317 --> 00:22:20.844
that really have the ability to kill a bill

550
00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:23.616
had told him that that had to go.

551
00:22:23.616 --> 00:22:24.316
<v ->Yes.</v>

552
00:22:24.316 --> 00:22:26.696
<v ->Because otherwise they would kill it, so.</v>

553
00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:28.265
Question again, why?

554
00:22:28.265 --> 00:22:29.077
<v ->Why?</v>

555
00:22:29.077 --> 00:22:34.077
In your explorations

556
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.953
the why is, they're supposedly saying that they're doing

557
00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:39.773
weather modification.

558
00:22:39.773 --> 00:22:43.049
I've read other reports that say there could be

559
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:48.746
another military application by creating this

560
00:22:48.746 --> 00:22:51.238
aluminum skin around the planet you bounce

561
00:22:51.238 --> 00:22:54.430
signals off of and get certain kinds of radio signals

562
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.874
to identify troop movement and for military spying

563
00:22:57.874 --> 00:22:58.882
applications.

564
00:22:58.882 --> 00:23:00.842
What else have you found out?

565
00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:02.914
Even if it's conjecture at this point,

566
00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.622
without getting wild about it.

567
00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:06.833
<v ->(laughs) Well it's wild enough as it is.</v>

568
00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:08.121
<v ->It is wild enough as it is.</v>

569
00:23:08.121 --> 00:23:10.669
<v ->If you just stick to the facts like the evidence</v>

570
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:12.909
of the chemicals coming out of the sky,

571
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:14.981
that's hard enough for people to accept

572
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:17.193
even though you've the lab tests and everything.

573
00:23:17.193 --> 00:23:18.257
<v ->Everything's right there.</v>

574
00:23:18.257 --> 00:23:21.226
<v ->But you know, these people have practiced the art</v>

575
00:23:21.226 --> 00:23:26.014
of denial or plausible denial so well,

576
00:23:26.014 --> 00:23:27.441
and it works.

577
00:23:27.441 --> 00:23:30.774
For example, there was one website that came out

578
00:23:30.774 --> 00:23:34.301
specifically to debunk our film.

579
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.653
They said, "Don't pay attention to their readings

580
00:23:36.653 --> 00:23:38.977
"of the aluminum up on Mount Shasta.

581
00:23:38.977 --> 00:23:40.910
"That's doesn't mean anything," they said.

582
00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:41.861
Why not?

583
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:43.822
Said, "Look, Mount Shasta everybody knows

584
00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.170
"it's a ski resort, right?

585
00:23:45.697 --> 00:23:47.713
"Now there are people skiing up there.

586
00:23:47.713 --> 00:23:50.317
"And do you know what's at the bottom of skis?

587
00:23:50.317 --> 00:23:53.257
"Aluminum, that's where the aluminum came from."

588
00:23:53.257 --> 00:23:55.385
And you know there were people that sent us

589
00:23:55.385 --> 00:23:57.485
emails and letters and say, "Oh read this,

590
00:23:57.485 --> 00:23:59.417
"because here's the explanation as to why you found

591
00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:01.377
"aluminum in the snow up there.

592
00:24:01.377 --> 00:24:02.945
"Came from the skis."

593
00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:05.325
People believe any plausible denial if

594
00:24:05.325 --> 00:24:07.341
it's more comfortable to believe it.

595
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:09.021
The truth of the matter by the way is

596
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:10.253
that where this snow was taken there was

597
00:24:10.253 --> 00:24:11.261
no skiing there.

598
00:24:11.261 --> 00:24:12.773
(laughter drowns out speech)

599
00:24:12.773 --> 00:24:16.609
But anyway, the art of plausible denial works so well.

600
00:24:16.609 --> 00:24:21.609
If it works well with the situation where we have evidence,

601
00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:24.057
hard evidence like the chemical analysis,

602
00:24:24.057 --> 00:24:25.849
can you imagine how well it would work in

603
00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:29.013
these other fields where we really don't have

604
00:24:29.013 --> 00:24:31.617
as much evidence now as we should?

605
00:24:31.617 --> 00:24:34.277
We will, by the way, 'cause I think the day is coming

606
00:24:34.277 --> 00:24:37.217
when they'll be some real serious whistleblowers.

607
00:24:37.217 --> 00:24:40.157
We've already had contact with a couple of people

608
00:24:40.157 --> 00:24:43.685
on the inside, and they said, "We know that what you say

609
00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:46.289
"is true, but we cannot speak on it,

610
00:24:46.289 --> 00:24:50.629
"or it'll cost us our jobs, or worse."

611
00:24:50.629 --> 00:24:53.877
I've tried to encourage these people to come forth anyway,

612
00:24:53.877 --> 00:24:55.053
but they haven't.

613
00:24:55.053 --> 00:24:56.817
Someday somebody will.

614
00:24:56.817 --> 00:24:59.701
<v ->I hear it's very compartmentalized on the ground.</v>

615
00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:02.977
The people that fuel versus the people that

616
00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:06.085
put this particular substance in or on board

617
00:25:06.085 --> 00:25:08.213
are very separate from one another,

618
00:25:08.213 --> 00:25:10.733
I've heard from other people in the military.

619
00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:13.197
So no one really knows what the other one's doing.

620
00:25:13.197 --> 00:25:16.445
It used to be very upsetting to me to think,

621
00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:19.915
what does that pilot think he's doing?

622
00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:22.549
Maybe that pilot's really not clear on what he's doing.

623
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:24.005
He's just buying the agenda,

624
00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:25.377
he knows he's doing something.

625
00:25:25.377 --> 00:25:26.497
<v ->I'm sure he's been told that whatever it is</v>

626
00:25:26.497 --> 00:25:28.625
he's doing is for the best of mankind.

627
00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:31.453
It's probably been told that they're fighting

628
00:25:31.453 --> 00:25:36.017
global warming, but it's a top secret operation

629
00:25:36.017 --> 00:25:38.145
because you know there are a lot of idiots out there

630
00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:41.645
who won't appreciate that, so we'll keep it a secret.

631
00:25:41.645 --> 00:25:44.053
We don't wanna get politically controversial,

632
00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:45.985
so just keep it a secret, and by the way,

633
00:25:45.985 --> 00:25:47.469
here's your bonus.

634
00:25:47.469 --> 00:25:49.037
<v ->Right. Right.</v>

635
00:25:49.037 --> 00:25:50.493
<v ->And that works, you know?</v>

636
00:25:50.493 --> 00:25:52.649
<v ->Yeah, bonuses work and also losing your employment</v>

637
00:25:52.649 --> 00:25:54.357
and everything else works on the other side

638
00:25:54.357 --> 00:25:57.605
if you are going to break the code and speak about it.

639
00:25:57.605 --> 00:26:00.013
<v ->One of the people I'm talking about is a pilot,</v>

640
00:26:00.013 --> 00:26:02.337
by the way, but he just doesn't feel

641
00:26:02.337 --> 00:26:05.359
he's free to say.

642
00:26:05.473 --> 00:26:07.487
<v ->Does he know what he's doing?</v>

643
00:26:07.797 --> 00:26:10.707
<v ->This one doesn't know but he's pretty sure.</v>

644
00:26:11.297 --> 00:26:12.725
He's pretty sure.

645
00:26:12.725 --> 00:26:14.937
He knows they're spraying and all he knows is

646
00:26:14.937 --> 00:26:17.289
what they've told that it's good for,

647
00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:20.145
but he's questioning and that's the beginning

648
00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:22.719
of this process.

649
00:26:22.917 --> 00:26:25.297
And then when he finally figures out that his own family

650
00:26:25.297 --> 00:26:28.657
is breathing this stuff, and his own food and his water

651
00:26:28.657 --> 00:26:31.429
supply contains this stuff, and that it's shortening

652
00:26:31.429 --> 00:26:36.429
their lives and making them susceptible to diseases,

653
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:38.849
and reducing their fertility rate,

654
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:42.153
and all of these things, one of these guys is gonna say,

655
00:26:42.153 --> 00:26:44.953
"I don't care, I'm gonna speak the truth."

656
00:26:44.953 --> 00:26:46.437
And that's what we're waiting for.

657
00:26:46.437 --> 00:26:47.893
<v ->This is a particularly--</v>

658
00:26:47.893 --> 00:26:52.175
the reason I haven't really covered this for CMN

659
00:26:52.933 --> 00:26:54.865
is because it's one of those things

660
00:26:54.865 --> 00:26:57.719
that makes a person feel helpless

661
00:26:58.309 --> 00:27:01.277
and that's a terrible position for anyone.

662
00:27:01.277 --> 00:27:03.629
So many people say, "Look, if I can't do anything

663
00:27:03.629 --> 00:27:05.981
"about it, I don't wanna know about it."

664
00:27:05.981 --> 00:27:08.361
I always grapple with how do you present something

665
00:27:08.361 --> 00:27:11.133
when you don't have an obvious--

666
00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:14.157
there's not an obvious solution presenting itself,

667
00:27:14.157 --> 00:27:16.005
how do you deal with that,

668
00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:17.685
and how do we deal with that right now,

669
00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:20.205
with the viewers watching this, who may or may not

670
00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:22.277
have been convinced until now?

671
00:27:22.277 --> 00:27:25.637
<v ->I've come to grips with that a long time ago.</v>

672
00:27:25.637 --> 00:27:27.849
My conclusion is a little bit pessimistic,

673
00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:30.229
but then the longer I've thought about it,

674
00:27:30.229 --> 00:27:32.161
the more optimistic it becomes.

675
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:33.617
So what is that?

676
00:27:33.617 --> 00:27:37.341
The conclusion is that the majority of people

677
00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:40.057
will never want to step up and run against

678
00:27:41.422 --> 00:27:43.660
the popular opinion.

679
00:27:44.054 --> 00:27:47.526
Whatever it is, they don't have it within them

680
00:27:47.526 --> 00:27:49.234
to be upstream.

681
00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:51.838
It's more comfortable to go along

682
00:27:51.838 --> 00:27:55.534
and we'll never change them.

683
00:27:55.534 --> 00:27:57.746
So that's the pessimistic part.

684
00:27:57.746 --> 00:28:00.546
The optimistic part is that we don't have to change them,

685
00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:03.934
because society is always led and influenced by

686
00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:07.154
about 3% or less of the population.

687
00:28:07.154 --> 00:28:10.906
Those who say, "By golly, I'm gonna do this."

688
00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:13.986
Sometimes on the wrong side, but for whatever reason

689
00:28:13.986 --> 00:28:16.282
they are the leaders, the born leaders,

690
00:28:16.282 --> 00:28:18.858
the ones that say, "I'm not gonna just sit by here

691
00:28:18.858 --> 00:28:20.846
"and wonder where this boat is going.

692
00:28:20.846 --> 00:28:23.590
"I'm gonna grab an oar or a rudder."

693
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.314
1%, 2%, 3% of the population at most.

694
00:28:27.314 --> 00:28:29.554
Those are the people I'm talking to.

695
00:28:29.554 --> 00:28:31.738
Those are the ones I wanna meet, because I know

696
00:28:31.738 --> 00:28:35.742
if we can get that 3% or whatever it is

697
00:28:35.742 --> 00:28:38.178
all in unison and doing something about it,

698
00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:43.078
we can overcome that 51, 58, 60% of the population

699
00:28:43.078 --> 00:28:46.128
that just doesn't want to make waves.

700
00:28:46.326 --> 00:28:48.566
<v ->And then that 3% I assume you're saying,</v>

701
00:28:48.566 --> 00:28:51.450
can, if we're squeaky enough wheels out there,

702
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.334
that ultimately some pressure can be applied, or?

703
00:28:54.334 --> 00:28:56.070
<v ->I go even further than that.</v>

704
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.366
I don't think that being a squeaky wheel

705
00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:00.298
is necessarily the ultimate answer.

706
00:29:00.298 --> 00:29:01.586
We do have to squeak a lot if

707
00:29:01.586 --> 00:29:03.434
you wanna get attention,

708
00:29:03.434 --> 00:29:06.542
but by and large the people we're asking

709
00:29:06.542 --> 00:29:11.470
to give us the attention are the very ones

710
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.318
who are opposing us.

711
00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:15.502
In other words, they're the ones in political positions

712
00:29:15.502 --> 00:29:17.210
of authority and power.

713
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.170
I don't think that writing a letter to your Congressman

714
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.598
on this issue is gonna work.

715
00:29:20.598 --> 00:29:21.438
<v ->No, it doesn't.</v>

716
00:29:21.438 --> 00:29:22.642
<v ->Because he's part of the problem.</v>

717
00:29:22.642 --> 00:29:23.454
<v ->Exactly.</v>

718
00:29:23.454 --> 00:29:24.854
<v ->He knows what's going on,</v>

719
00:29:24.854 --> 00:29:26.982
but he's already made his deal with somebody, you know?

720
00:29:26.982 --> 00:29:30.538
So I think ultimately it's not squeaking the wheel,

721
00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:31.854
or making the wheel squeak,

722
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:33.198
but to replace to wheel.

723
00:29:33.198 --> 00:29:35.018
Let's get new people in there.

724
00:29:35.018 --> 00:29:37.454
Let's ourselves go into positions of influence

725
00:29:37.454 --> 00:29:38.714
and leadership.

726
00:29:38.714 --> 00:29:40.926
Let's go run for office, for example.

727
00:29:40.926 --> 00:29:42.242
We have an organization we call

728
00:29:42.242 --> 00:29:44.258
Freedom Force International, and one of our

729
00:29:44.258 --> 00:29:48.738
big projects right now, we call it Project City Hall.

730
00:29:48.738 --> 00:29:51.706
It's based on our unofficial motto,

731
00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:56.074
the unofficial motto is don't fight City Hall,

732
00:29:56.074 --> 00:29:57.698
when you can be City Hall.

733
00:29:57.698 --> 00:29:58.818
<v ->Yeah, that's great.</v>

734
00:29:58.818 --> 00:29:59.742
<v ->This is great.</v>

735
00:29:59.742 --> 00:30:03.494
It's time to stop sending letters to Congressmen

736
00:30:03.494 --> 00:30:05.650
and saying, "Won't you please follow the Constitution

737
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:06.966
"for a change?"
<v ->Doesn't do any good.</v>

738
00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:08.702
<v ->Never will, that's not why they're there.</v>

739
00:30:08.702 --> 00:30:10.718
We gotta get those guys replaced with people

740
00:30:10.718 --> 00:30:12.230
who think like we do.

741
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.758
That's why we say run for City Hall, run for dogcatcher,

742
00:30:15.758 --> 00:30:19.006
go onto your school board, go into your city council,

743
00:30:19.006 --> 00:30:21.862
go into your county board of supervisors,

744
00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:24.494
whatever it is, go into local politics and then

745
00:30:24.494 --> 00:30:25.950
work your way up.

746
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.106
If thousands of people do that,

747
00:30:28.106 --> 00:30:31.634
eventually then we can influence all of society.

748
00:30:31.634 --> 00:30:34.686
It's not just being a squeaky wheel.

749
00:30:34.686 --> 00:30:36.170
We have to change the wheel.

750
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.550
<v ->To have to change the wheel, perfectly put.</v>

751
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.566
I love your website, Unfiltered News.

752
00:30:40.566 --> 00:30:41.546
Just love it.

753
00:30:41.546 --> 00:30:42.470
<v ->I didn't know you watched it.</v>

754
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.038
<v ->Oh yeah, absolutely, like I said,</v>

755
00:30:44.038 --> 00:30:47.006
we post from you and you know as I'm thinking about this,

756
00:30:47.006 --> 00:30:48.266
there are a couple things that come up.

757
00:30:48.266 --> 00:30:51.346
Our bodies are taking in this aluminum and barium

758
00:30:51.346 --> 00:30:53.250
unless we're--someone is watching from

759
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.294
some very tiny little island they haven't gotten

760
00:30:55.294 --> 00:30:57.394
around to somewhere, it's all over the NATO countries,

761
00:30:57.394 --> 00:31:00.306
this is Europe, Britain, everywhere.

762
00:31:00.306 --> 00:31:01.230
That they're spraying.

763
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.098
<v ->It is, yeah.</v>

764
00:31:02.098 --> 00:31:05.906
<v ->I'm just thinking one of the things we've been learning</v>

765
00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:09.182
more about recently is dirty electricity

766
00:31:09.182 --> 00:31:11.590
which activates and moves around all the toxic metals

767
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.942
in the body and makes everything even worse.

768
00:31:13.942 --> 00:31:16.434
It seems like there might be a number of ways in which

769
00:31:16.434 --> 00:31:18.646
we can create our own homegrown protocols

770
00:31:18.646 --> 00:31:22.146
for the moment, to start at least taking care of our bodies

771
00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:24.302
as best we can, assuming that we're being exposed

772
00:31:24.302 --> 00:31:26.290
to all of this, and I think that might be an area

773
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.958
that I would like to start looking into.

774
00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:32.926
Start looking at how to make a clean electric environment

775
00:31:32.926 --> 00:31:35.138
in the house and then maybe start using chlorella

776
00:31:35.138 --> 00:31:37.210
and greens and things to start leaching this stuff

777
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.834
out of the body as best we can.

778
00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:41.074
Any other ideas on that?

779
00:31:41.074 --> 00:31:42.670
<v ->I certainly agree with you on that.</v>

780
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.966
We have to play a double role.

781
00:31:44.966 --> 00:31:47.374
We have to be defensive to protect ourselves

782
00:31:47.374 --> 00:31:50.426
as best we can, but I think we have to be realistic

783
00:31:50.426 --> 00:31:54.010
and recognize that if we don't change the system,

784
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.522
we don't change that wheel in other words,

785
00:31:55.522 --> 00:31:56.810
that won't make anything difference.

786
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.022
It's just gonna continue going the other way.

787
00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:02.830
As long as we understand that the defensive role

788
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.126
is not enough, I think we should do that,

789
00:32:05.126 --> 00:32:07.310
but meanwhile we should begin to think in terms

790
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.202
of becoming aggressive and bringing about change,

791
00:32:11.202 --> 00:32:13.582
so we're not just trying to survive the system.

792
00:32:13.582 --> 00:32:15.878
We need to change the system.

793
00:32:15.878 --> 00:32:17.054
<v ->Hear, hear.</v>

794
00:32:17.054 --> 00:32:17.922
Thank you so much.

795
00:32:17.922 --> 00:32:19.714
On that note, I know they're waiting for you

796
00:32:19.714 --> 00:32:22.430
for a book signing upstairs, so I have to let you go.

797
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.026
And thank you so much for your time, Ed.

798
00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:26.236
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

799
00:32:26.658 --> 00:32:28.030
<v ->If you've not already done so, it's worth</v>

800
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.102
beginning your own research on this subject,

801
00:32:30.102 --> 00:32:32.006
which can take you down a couple of unexpected

802
00:32:32.006 --> 00:32:33.238
rabbit holes.

803
00:32:33.238 --> 00:32:34.806
If you don't wanna go that direction,

804
00:32:34.806 --> 00:32:37.074
then follow Ed's advice and begin looking at how we

805
00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:39.818
can take public action against those who are

806
00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:42.170
not looking out for our best interests.

807
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.410
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

808
00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.860
