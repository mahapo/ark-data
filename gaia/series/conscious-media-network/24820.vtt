00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:03.012
<v ->Jay Weidner is a scholar, film maker and writer,</v>

2
00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:05.397
who has spent decades researching gnostic texts,

3
00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:07.997
Egyptian mysticism and alchemy.

4
00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.301
His most recent film is the documentary,

5
00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.335
Time Wave 2013.

6
00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:15.027
In this conversation, Jay speaks very frankly

7
00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:16.876
about the times in which we're living

8
00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:19.710
and the need for people to be prepared for rapid change.

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.616
More so, Jay is saying that we need to take a proactive

10
00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:25.247
position in choosing the quality of our future

11
00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:28.284
rather than waiting to see what's going to be dished to us,

12
00:00:28.284 --> 00:00:31.041
because he says it would not be to our liking.

13
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.907
(calming music)

14
00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.026
<v Voiceover>Jay, you're talking about</v>

15
00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:43.191
the greatest crisis in human history,

16
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:44.499
and you're saying it didn't just start

17
00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:45.504
in the last couple of years,

18
00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.506
even though that's when the discomfort

19
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.876
may be ratcheting up for those who are awake.

20
00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:51.988
But you say 14, 15 years ago.

21
00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:53.180
Can you talk about that?

22
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.014
<v ->Yeah, well the Mayan calendar moves</v>

23
00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.007
in 20 year cycles.

24
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.049
They're called kathoons,

25
00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.381
and the last 20 year cycle of the Mayan calendar

26
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.892
began in 1992, 1993 and ends in 2012.

27
00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:07.893
As we all know the famous 2012 date.

28
00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:12.545
And you can see

29
00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:16.415
a kind of sudden deterioration in the body politic

30
00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:17.674
around that time.

31
00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:23.568
Greed was unleashed and people were becoming

32
00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:27.713
incredibly self centered and but also other things happened.

33
00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:31.015
For instance the internet really got going in 1993.

34
00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.879
Globalization, NAFTA and GAT were passed

35
00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:34.987
around that time period.

36
00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:38.623
So we can see there's a beginning of a strange

37
00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:41.986
coherence that started there,

38
00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:43.599
which also,

39
00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.998
kind of parallels the incoherence

40
00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:50.090
that began at the same time.

41
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.287
And as you travel through that time period

42
00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:57.335
it's like watching a slow automobile accident.

43
00:01:58.355 --> 00:01:59.504
You know, in slow motion

44
00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:01.172
and you're watching the wheels come off

45
00:02:01.172 --> 00:02:02.501
and you're watching the door crunch

46
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:03.781
and the glass is busting.

47
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:06.382
And you know something bad is gonna happen,

48
00:02:06.382 --> 00:02:06.779
and you know,

49
00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.086
<v Voiceover>Have the air bags already?</v>

50
00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.265
<v ->Air bags are going. (laughter)</v>

51
00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:10.820
And you know, oh my god, you know?

52
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.781
And so for us who are maybe aware of all this

53
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.159
it's somewhat painful to watch it,

54
00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.611
because we tried to warn people then.

55
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.529
I had a show on National Public Radio

56
00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:20.860
and I was, at the time.

57
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.192
And I was trying to tell people

58
00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.336
that it was time to start action.

59
00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:25.953
And no one would do it because human beings

60
00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:27.438
are inherently lazy.

61
00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:28.334
I'm sorry to say,

62
00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:31.410
and they won't do anything until it's time to do it.

63
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.174
So we been sitting around,

64
00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:34.874
twittling our thumbs,

65
00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:37.114
thinking about all the things that we

66
00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:39.034
want to do in our lives and everything.

67
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:42.488
And now the exteriorized world is about to come in,

68
00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:44.917
invade our private lives

69
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.955
and disrupt everything we know.

70
00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.255
That's what's going on.

71
00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:53.391
And my contention is no longer that this is happening.

72
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.466
If you don't believe that this is happening,

73
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.970
I don't care.

74
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.935
Honestly, I'm sorry.

75
00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:02.628
But if you are sensitive enough to know

76
00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:06.143
there's something odd happening then you're the ones

77
00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:07.738
that I'm trying to talk to.

78
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:10.511
And you know there's something going on

79
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.584
and you're not sure what to do about it.

80
00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:16.271
And that is the premiere question

81
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.977
that we must ask ourselves today.

82
00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.286
What is it that we want?

83
00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:21.492
Where are we going

84
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:24.093
and what do we want to have when we get there.

85
00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:28.496
And if we want to go on with this materialist

86
00:03:29.496 --> 00:03:31.329
world that we're living in,

87
00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.005
we're gonna fail.

88
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:34.905
It's a virtual world.

89
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:37.008
It's not built on anything that's real.

90
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.513
It's not built on growing food and loving each other.

91
00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:43.817
It's built on virtual money that you made that you lost.

92
00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:45.280
That you made and then you lost.

93
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.251
And you never really had it to begin with.

94
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.014
And then you're angry because you think

95
00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:51.789
you lost what you never had.

96
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.754
When it was never there and it has no value.

97
00:03:55.754 --> 00:03:58.964
And so we're living in a world where nothing

98
00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:01.158
has any value any more.

99
00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:02.529
And it's getting worse.

100
00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:07.304
Right now the commodity exchanges are collapsing

101
00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:09.336
becuase no one's buying anything.

102
00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:12.769
General Motors isn't buying metal from Africa.

103
00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.416
Toyota isn't buying plastics from Mexico.

104
00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:19.281
We're seeing this incredible commodity breakdown happening.

105
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:23.148
Shipping has virtually coming to a standstill in the world.

106
00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:26.612
Grains aren't being shipped from the United States to China,

107
00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:28.644
or from Argentina to India.

108
00:04:28.644 --> 00:04:33.124
And if you're a wise person and you can extrapilate

109
00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:34.993
on what is happening in the present

110
00:04:34.993 --> 00:04:37.726
to figure out what is going on in the future,

111
00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:39.964
then you will see that we're heading towards

112
00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:42.534
a complete breakdown of everything.

113
00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:44.098
And I want to say one thing.

114
00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:47.806
Being psychic is our survival tactic,

115
00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:50.742
and the tribes in the hunter gatherer days

116
00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:53.404
that were psychic, the shamans who were psychic,

117
00:04:53.404 --> 00:04:55.822
they knew were the fist would be a week from now.

118
00:04:55.822 --> 00:04:57.549
They knew where the herds would be.

119
00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:58.920
So they survived.

120
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.018
The ones who didn't have the psychic abilities died.

121
00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:03.959
And so the human race has an intrinsic

122
00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:07.829
evolutionarily derived psychic nature

123
00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:11.801
that has been a survival tactic that we have used.

124
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.662
And we, especially in the last, in the West,

125
00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:17.135
in the last five or six hundred years,

126
00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:20.561
we honestly, we killed our psychics,

127
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:21.505
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

128
00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:25.650
<v ->in the Inquisition and so we are bereft of this</v>

129
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.246
incredible knowlede and so we have to go to other cultures

130
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.539
to find out what they're saying.

131
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.551
So we're going to Mumbai.

132
00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:33.317
<v Voiceover>That's where the 2012 conference.</v>

133
00:05:33.317 --> 00:05:34.089
<v ->That's right.</v>

134
00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:35.447
That's where we went to the Mayans.

135
00:05:35.447 --> 00:05:36.493
We went to the Cairo.

136
00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:40.831
We went to the Tibetans and we brought back that knowledge.

137
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.934
And a few of us still retained,

138
00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:45.697
somehow we survived the Inquisition

139
00:05:47.627 --> 00:05:49.293
with our psychic abilitites in tact.

140
00:05:49.293 --> 00:05:51.210
And we know what's going on,

141
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.040
but we can't convince those who are not

142
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.246
as aware of us, that this is happening.

143
00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:01.806
So we've kind of thrown our hands up and said,

144
00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:04.011
okay then this must be preordained.

145
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.185
It is just going to happen.

146
00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:09.060
<v Voiceover>You were talking about in the 1990's.</v>

147
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.158
Well, here we're seeing just unmitigated greed

148
00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:13.093
on every level.

149
00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:15.033
Now we're seeing wheels come off the economy.

150
00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:17.227
We're even looking at an embarrassed,

151
00:06:17.227 --> 00:06:18.903
if you can say that,

152
00:06:18.903 --> 00:06:22.328
Allen Greenspan, (laughs)

153
00:06:22.328 --> 00:06:24.573
be roasted before the Congress.

154
00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:24.823
<v ->I wish.</v>

155
00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:26.804
<v Voiceover>Saying, well there's one thing</v>

156
00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:28.545
I thought I could rely on.

157
00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:30.780
I thought I could rely on the fact that companies

158
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.411
would at least keep this going

159
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:35.819
through their own desire for self preservation.

160
00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.682
What happened where that didn't even work?

161
00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:38.484
<v ->That is great.</v>

162
00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:39.287
That's a great question.

163
00:06:39.287 --> 00:06:41.454
Yeah, we'd been told by Milton Freidman

164
00:06:41.454 --> 00:06:43.289
and all these economists that the market

165
00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:44.579
will solve all problems

166
00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:46.682
and that the market is self correcting

167
00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:48.562
and you know we bought it.

168
00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:49.567
We believed it, you know.

169
00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:53.468
So we kind of dropped this Kensian economics

170
00:06:53.468 --> 00:06:54.474
in the last 20 years.

171
00:06:54.474 --> 00:06:56.201
Around 1992 by the way.

172
00:06:56.201 --> 00:06:58.934
And we developed and adopted this,

173
00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:04.029
developed from an Austrian economist, Milton Freidman.

174
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.478
And it's this laisez faire attitude

175
00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:08.245
that everything will correct itself.

176
00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:11.015
And it is odd, to be honest with you,

177
00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:13.819
that a company would fudge it's books,

178
00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.612
because it has to answer up and make a profit.

179
00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:17.628
So why would it do that.

180
00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:18.661
<v Voiceover>So why would a compnay do that?</v>

181
00:07:18.661 --> 00:07:19.859
Why would they cook their books

182
00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:21.830
knowing what's coming down the pipe?

183
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.569
<v ->Because we intrinsically</v>

184
00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:28.418
know that this is coming apart.

185
00:07:28.418 --> 00:07:32.472
And the CEO's and the leaders of corporate America

186
00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:35.811
and the world are grabbing everything they can

187
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:36.949
before it's gone.

188
00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:37.990
It's a white out sale.

189
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.917
<v Voiceover>The last lamb grab.</v>

190
00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.349
<v ->Everything must go.</v>

191
00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.279
It's a gigantic sale.

192
00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:43.915
Like at Macy's.

193
00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:46.952
Unfortunately, we have to find a way to stop them

194
00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:49.583
from taking every single last resource

195
00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:51.097
before it's gone.

196
00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:53.332
If we don't do this there's not going to be

197
00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:57.761
any forest left, any fish left, any topsoil left.

198
00:07:57.761 --> 00:07:59.630
And we're going to all starve to death.

199
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.501
Okay, because they've got this idea

200
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.670
that they can grab all they want and move into citadels

201
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.165
of power where they'll be protected from the masses

202
00:08:10.165 --> 00:08:12.278
that are outside the citadels.

203
00:08:12.278 --> 00:08:15.529
And there is no place safe any more.

204
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.550
Leonard Cohen said you know,

205
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.420
that in the future you're private life

206
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.992
will be completely known.

207
00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:24.722
And this was before the internet.

208
00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:27.333
And that's what's going on now.

209
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.669
So we know who they are now.

210
00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:31.325
We know their names.

211
00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.218
It's the first time in history, because of the internet,

212
00:08:33.218 --> 00:08:34.502
we know their names.

213
00:08:34.502 --> 00:08:37.273
And they know that we now know who they are.

214
00:08:37.273 --> 00:08:38.957
<v Voiceover>But they have secret places to go to</v>

215
00:08:38.957 --> 00:08:40.140
that we don't.
<v ->They do.</v>

216
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.478
They do.

217
00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.840
They're building underground facilities

218
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.678
all over the southwest United States,

219
00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.848
under Denver airport and they think

220
00:08:46.848 --> 00:08:49.885
they're gonna hang out their until this thing is over.

221
00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:52.618
And this thing that they want to have happen,

222
00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:56.621
I call the culling and it's to pull the rug out

223
00:08:56.621 --> 00:08:58.927
from underneath us all, with oil.

224
00:08:58.927 --> 00:09:02.096
And when the oil based economy goes

225
00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:04.097
because we don't know how to grow food without oil,

226
00:09:04.097 --> 00:09:06.596
because we can't transport goods without oil,

227
00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:08.431
everything will fall into chaos

228
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:10.107
and we're gonna kill each other.

229
00:09:10.107 --> 00:09:12.738
This is what they think will happen.

230
00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:15.410
And this is what they sort of are planning on.

231
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.180
Okay?

232
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.020
And we have to say, yeah that's not gonna be

233
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.452
the way its,

234
00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:22.352
you think that's what's gonna happen

235
00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:25.018
because of the way that we used to be.

236
00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:27.452
But that's not the way it is now.

237
00:09:27.452 --> 00:09:28.721
And that's what this is all about.

238
00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:31.891
We're building a future that is completely

239
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:37.031
denying them the right to the reigns of power.

240
00:09:37.031 --> 00:09:38.535
<v Voiceover>I heard a very interesting</v>

241
00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:40.597
statistic recently and I looked at the math

242
00:09:40.597 --> 00:09:42.141
and I thought, I'd love to have a couple of other

243
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:43.573
mathematicians go over this.

244
00:09:43.573 --> 00:09:44.762
Because it was saying,

245
00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:47.739
and just forgive me because my numbers

246
00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:50.145
are off just a little bit, but something like

247
00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:54.537
a parcel of 45 feet by 125 feet.

248
00:09:54.537 --> 00:09:56.776
If you put two people in a little home,

249
00:09:56.776 --> 00:09:58.483
on that amount of space,

250
00:09:58.483 --> 00:10:01.185
you could fit the entire population of the world

251
00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:02.262
in the state of Texas.

252
00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:03.054
<v ->Dang.</v>

253
00:10:03.054 --> 00:10:04.893
<v Voiceover>Okay, now, doesn't that mean</v>

254
00:10:04.893 --> 00:10:06.226
that we're simply doing it all wrong?

255
00:10:06.226 --> 00:10:06.569
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

256
00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:07.791
<v Voiceover>We should not be starving to death.</v>

257
00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:09.863
<v ->No thank you for that question</v>

258
00:10:09.863 --> 00:10:11.210
because people come to me and say,

259
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.296
well it's a good thing.

260
00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:13.171
I was just in Germany

261
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:14.654
and they were, oh it's a good thing

262
00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:16.493
that they're gonna kill everybody.

263
00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:17.326
There's too many people.

264
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.642
Well, where do you get your idea from?

265
00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:20.780
Well, you're getting it from them,

266
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.141
because they're the ones that are financing

267
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.705
the studies that says there's too many people.

268
00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:27.078
That's right Paul Ehrlich who wrote the Population Bomb,

269
00:10:27.078 --> 00:10:29.182
was funded by the Council on Foreign Relations.

270
00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:32.118
And he said that the world would be wiped out

271
00:10:32.118 --> 00:10:34.390
by 1980 and gigantic famines.

272
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.287
It didn't happen.

273
00:10:35.287 --> 00:10:39.351
If we had ten billion people living on planet earth,

274
00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:40.417
we have six billion now.

275
00:10:40.417 --> 00:10:42.327
If we had 10 billion and they were all living

276
00:10:42.327 --> 00:10:45.334
like Zen monks, you could fly over the earth

277
00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:47.193
continuously and see no evidence

278
00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:49.773
of human civilization anywhere.

279
00:10:49.773 --> 00:10:52.727
You could have 1 billion Bill Gates

280
00:10:52.727 --> 00:10:54.312
and the world would be destroyed.

281
00:10:54.312 --> 00:10:56.781
So it is not the quantity of the people

282
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.280
it's the consumption habits that we're,

283
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.246
and we think we need this and we think we need that

284
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:03.556
because they've sold us.

285
00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:08.077
Because they are in a 300 year long ponzi scheme.

286
00:11:08.077 --> 00:11:10.957
And it started around 1700 and it's ending now.

287
00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:11.990
And it's a ponzi scheme.

288
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.601
It's a pyramid scheme where the people at the very end

289
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:16.998
of it get screwed by everybody else,

290
00:11:16.998 --> 00:11:19.365
and we're the ones that are on the bottom of the pyramid

291
00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:22.403
and we're about to get screwed by this ponzi scheme.

292
00:11:24.063 --> 00:11:24.547
<v Voiceover>But you're saying it doesn't</v>

293
00:11:24.547 --> 00:11:25.397
have to be that way.

294
00:11:25.397 --> 00:11:26.504
<v ->It's not going to be that way.</v>

295
00:11:26.504 --> 00:11:28.038
<v Voiceover>Yes, let's talk about your vision</v>

296
00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:28.773
of what happens.

297
00:11:28.773 --> 00:11:30.175
We're gonna pop through this viel.

298
00:11:30.175 --> 00:11:31.810
We all know that we're here at 2012,

299
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.283
recession of the equinox.

300
00:11:33.283 --> 00:11:35.213
We have interviews with a number of people on that,

301
00:11:35.213 --> 00:11:37.011
but let's just say now we've popped through

302
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:37.956
to the other side.

303
00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:40.120
What do you think this (mumbles) period feels like

304
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.857
and what's it going to look like on the other side?

305
00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:44.021
<v ->Well the next few years until 2012</v>

306
00:11:44.021 --> 00:11:46.957
are gonna be unfortunately, for all of us not very good.

307
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:51.031
And we are going to have to radically reassess

308
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:52.138
what we are doing.

309
00:11:52.138 --> 00:11:55.384
If you are not waking up every single morning

310
00:11:55.384 --> 00:11:59.639
ready to radically reassess your life every day,

311
00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.498
you will fail.

312
00:12:01.498 --> 00:12:04.048
If you're not willing to rewrite everything,

313
00:12:04.048 --> 00:12:05.876
because everything is being rewritten

314
00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:09.848
and only those who are willing and courageous

315
00:12:09.848 --> 00:12:11.819
enough to do that are gonna be the ones

316
00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:13.922
to survive and their families of course.

317
00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:16.126
And I'm actually, I'm calling on men,

318
00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:20.332
because I know that women already know what's going on,

319
00:12:20.332 --> 00:12:22.933
but men have lost their way.

320
00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:26.163
And they are not taking control of their lives,

321
00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:28.835
they're not taking responsibility for their families,

322
00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:29.901
for their loved ones.

323
00:12:29.901 --> 00:12:33.406
And they're abrogating the authority that they have.

324
00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.682
Men do not really have a lot of authority.

325
00:12:35.682 --> 00:12:36.881
They can't create children.

326
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.917
They can't do these things.

327
00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:41.147
But what they can do is they can protect their loved ones,

328
00:12:41.147 --> 00:12:42.376
and they're not doing it.

329
00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:44.814
And so, I'm actually calling on men to

330
00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:48.858
return back to a time where you take responsibility

331
00:12:48.858 --> 00:12:50.524
for your life and for your family

332
00:12:50.524 --> 00:12:53.693
and you protect them from what is about to happen.

333
00:12:53.693 --> 00:12:56.294
And the way to protect them is not to buy a bunch of guns

334
00:12:56.294 --> 00:12:58.001
and go live like a survivalist.

335
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:00.906
Survivalists have some good things though.

336
00:13:00.906 --> 00:13:04.121
You need to get to a place where you can produce your

337
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.672
own food, fresh water.

338
00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:08.541
All these things are necessary,

339
00:13:08.541 --> 00:13:10.503
but there's other things that we need to do.

340
00:13:11.663 --> 00:13:16.663
We need to rethink our spiritual relationship

341
00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:19.488
with each other and with nature

342
00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:23.592
and we need to do a radical reassessment

343
00:13:23.592 --> 00:13:27.899
of how we operate in this world.

344
00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:31.597
And I'm not advocating like Marxism or something.

345
00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:33.202
I don't think it's a socialist revolution

346
00:13:33.202 --> 00:13:34.868
or a workers revolution.

347
00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:37.601
I think, Einstein said you could not solve a problem

348
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.445
at the same level that that problem was created.

349
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:43.046
We cannot solve political problems at a political level.

350
00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:44.275
We have to rise above it.

351
00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:47.709
The next level above political is the spiritual level.

352
00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:49.517
When we solve the spiritual problem

353
00:13:49.517 --> 00:13:52.717
the levels underneath will solve themselves

354
00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:56.892
and that's where we have to come in with these.

355
00:13:56.892 --> 00:13:59.859
We have to show the ones that don't believe

356
00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:02.033
what we're saying that what we're saying has a geat deal

357
00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:05.862
of credibility for your health, for the environment,

358
00:14:05.862 --> 00:14:07.000
for your well being.

359
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.038
And then we have to practice it ourselves

360
00:14:10.038 --> 00:14:11.673
which we're not doing a very good job of.

361
00:14:11.673 --> 00:14:13.908
And then so this is discipline.

362
00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:15.666
This is creating a discipline.

363
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.535
Tai chi or it's yoga.

364
00:14:17.535 --> 00:14:20.237
Or it's martial art.

365
00:14:20.237 --> 00:14:24.100
It's something that creates an internal dynamic

366
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.319
within the body that doesn't need

367
00:14:28.319 --> 00:14:32.929
to have the medical care

368
00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:35.326
that's pharmaceutically based.

369
00:14:35.326 --> 00:14:39.065
That we don't really want the government

370
00:14:39.065 --> 00:14:40.637
to give us health care.

371
00:14:40.637 --> 00:14:42.801
I hate to say this because it sounds like such a good idea

372
00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:44.701
because it won't be health care.

373
00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:46.143
It'll be death care.

374
00:14:46.143 --> 00:14:47.444
<v Voiceover>This is a really good point.</v>

375
00:14:47.444 --> 00:14:48.606
Let's get into that a little bit more,

376
00:14:48.606 --> 00:14:51.381
because one of the things that's going to go

377
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:53.551
as the economy continues its downturn

378
00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:55.379
is health benefits anyway.

379
00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:56.517
They're already taking them away.

380
00:14:56.517 --> 00:14:58.885
They're raising the deductible so high

381
00:14:58.885 --> 00:15:01.485
it's almost unreasonalble to even have health care.

382
00:15:01.485 --> 00:15:04.224
So this comes down to some hard core issues.

383
00:15:04.224 --> 00:15:07.154
Are we willing to take responsiblity for our own

384
00:15:07.154 --> 00:15:09.527
healths and that of our loved ones.

385
00:15:09.527 --> 00:15:11.396
And are we willing to live with those consequences?

386
00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:11.962
<v ->That's right.</v>

387
00:15:11.962 --> 00:15:14.624
And the thing is, is that,

388
00:15:14.624 --> 00:15:17.847
and the thing is with that is that

389
00:15:18.957 --> 00:15:21.075
only those people who are asking

390
00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:22.680
those questions will survive.

391
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.645
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

392
00:15:23.645 --> 00:15:26.050
<v ->That's the thing that's really ironic about this.</v>

393
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.789
This is actually a cultural evolution

394
00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:33.420
that is born from an intelligent

395
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.095
inquiry into nature and reality.

396
00:15:36.095 --> 00:15:37.957
And those who do that,

397
00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:41.594
who are unafraid to make that inquiry are going to survive

398
00:15:41.594 --> 00:15:45.170
and all the rest are it's gonna be borderline for them.

399
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.106
And I want them to come with us.

400
00:15:48.106 --> 00:15:51.103
And you know maybe it'll only be 10%,

401
00:15:51.103 --> 00:15:53.277
maybe it'll be 100%.

402
00:15:53.277 --> 00:15:54.404
We don't know.

403
00:15:54.404 --> 00:15:58.072
But if they keep relying on pharmaceuticals

404
00:15:58.072 --> 00:16:02.247
and the torturous food that they're selling

405
00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:05.640
in the stores then we are going to fail and.

406
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.818
<v Voiceover>What about education?</v>

407
00:16:06.818 --> 00:16:08.393
The torturous education in schools. (laughs)

408
00:16:08.393 --> 00:16:09.589
<v ->If you want to call it education.</v>

409
00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:10.299
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

410
00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:14.098
<v ->Yeah we need to find new ways to educate.</v>

411
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.063
We're not doing it.

412
00:16:15.063 --> 00:16:16.435
We can't do it in this.

413
00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:19.767
With the modern world,

414
00:16:19.767 --> 00:16:22.103
the mistake the modern world has made,

415
00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:25.101
is it has mistook

416
00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:28.547
quantity for quality.

417
00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:32.377
We think that if you're the biggest and the best.

418
00:16:32.377 --> 00:16:35.516
You know, you have the most quantity.

419
00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:40.423
That that somehow is a thing to be proud of.

420
00:16:40.423 --> 00:16:41.957
And it isn't the quantity.

421
00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:45.685
You can go to a really bad restaurant and have tons and tons

422
00:16:45.685 --> 00:16:47.828
of really bad food.

423
00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:49.964
You got a lot of food, okay.

424
00:16:49.964 --> 00:16:52.301
But none of it's worth a damn, okay.

425
00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:53.997
<v Voiceover>Are we talking education still I take it?</v>

426
00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:57.004
<v ->Mm-hmm. Yeah, and so we're not teaching</v>

427
00:16:57.004 --> 00:16:59.411
our children that it's quality of life.

428
00:16:59.411 --> 00:17:00.672
Not quantity of life.

429
00:17:00.672 --> 00:17:02.510
It's not how many years you lived,

430
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.578
it's what did you do in the years that you had.

431
00:17:05.578 --> 00:17:09.012
It's not how much money you have,

432
00:17:09.012 --> 00:17:12.283
it's what are you doing every day with your life.

433
00:17:12.283 --> 00:17:13.959
These are the things that we have

434
00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:16.926
completely misconstrued in the modern world.

435
00:17:16.926 --> 00:17:19.160
And these are the things that are, thank god,

436
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.295
shattering, blowing apart, coming to an end.

437
00:17:23.295 --> 00:17:26.398
And it's a reason for celebrating.

438
00:17:27.898 --> 00:17:30.408
It's a great thing that this old world is dying

439
00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:32.277
and a new world is emerging

440
00:17:32.277 --> 00:17:36.077
and we have to define that new world now.

441
00:17:36.077 --> 00:17:37.316
<v Voiceover>Doesn't it seem like it's going to</v>

442
00:17:37.316 --> 00:17:38.545
really take communal efforts,

443
00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:39.978
and again we're not talking communism

444
00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:40.761
or socialism.
<v ->No.</v>

445
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:42.406
<v Voiceover>We talking about caring about each other.</v>

446
00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:43.600
<v ->That's right.</v>

447
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.951
The problem with communism and socialism

448
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:47.790
is again it's dictated from above.

449
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.787
And it's the messiah complex.

450
00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:53.824
We keep waiting for this messiah to come and save us.

451
00:17:53.824 --> 00:17:56.029
And now we have America, we have another messiah

452
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:57.187
about to come and save us.

453
00:17:57.187 --> 00:17:59.239
And it's just, it's not gonna happen.

454
00:17:59.239 --> 00:18:01.240
And we have to like come to grips with this idea

455
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.373
that you're not going to have some force

456
00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:05.903
come from without and rearrange your life.

457
00:18:05.903 --> 00:18:08.971
If that happens, it's gonna be rearranged for the worst

458
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:10.677
because they don't have your interest at heart.

459
00:18:10.677 --> 00:18:13.146
They don't even know what your interests are, okay.

460
00:18:13.146 --> 00:18:16.783
So we have to reject their world.

461
00:18:16.783 --> 00:18:19.048
I hate to say this but that's where we are right now.

462
00:18:19.048 --> 00:18:20.125
We need to reject their world.

463
00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:22.411
We need to create our own scene.

464
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:25.093
Our own world, our own culture.

465
00:18:25.093 --> 00:18:27.084
Free from them.

466
00:18:27.084 --> 00:18:29.552
And when we do they will come to us.

467
00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:32.622
I'm old enough to remember Haight Ashbury.

468
00:18:32.622 --> 00:18:37.498
Okay, so the sixties, the hippies rejected modern culture.

469
00:18:37.498 --> 00:18:40.312
And they didn't do a very good job of it.

470
00:18:40.312 --> 00:18:41.531
And they took too many drugs.

471
00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:44.883
And they had too much, well I won't even go into that.

472
00:18:44.883 --> 00:18:49.079
But they rejected culture, and in that rejection,

473
00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:51.273
what would happen is, is that buses would drive

474
00:18:51.273 --> 00:18:54.494
up and down Haight Ashbury full of mid westerners

475
00:18:54.494 --> 00:18:56.556
looking at the hippies.

476
00:18:56.556 --> 00:18:58.450
The hippies weren't going to the midwest

477
00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.591
looking at the midwesterners.

478
00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:00.990
They were coming to San Francisco

479
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.361
and looking at the hippies.

480
00:19:02.361 --> 00:19:03.753
And that's what I mean.

481
00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:05.701
When you create a culture,

482
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:07.805
an alternative culture, they're gonna come to us.

483
00:19:07.805 --> 00:19:10.742
Now this time let's not do it the way we did it then.

484
00:19:10.742 --> 00:19:11.839
That was a mistake.

485
00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:12.540
It was fun.

486
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.944
<v Voiceover>We have to do it in a mature way this time.</v>

487
00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:14.295
<v ->Yes.</v>

488
00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:15.707
<v Voiceover>We have families (mumbles).</v>

489
00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:15.957
<v ->That's right.</v>

490
00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:18.309
We don't want our kids to do what we did.

491
00:19:18.309 --> 00:19:20.179
No, and we know the mistakes that we made

492
00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:21.875
and we know the casualties that occurred

493
00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:23.247
and we can't have that.

494
00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:27.889
So we're now moving into our sixties and we have

495
00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:31.089
to become the elders that we never had.

496
00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:33.226
<v Voiceover>And Jay we've got this election coming up</v>

497
00:19:33.226 --> 00:19:35.024
in a couple of days by the time anyone sees this

498
00:19:35.024 --> 00:19:36.132
it will have been passed,

499
00:19:36.132 --> 00:19:38.367
but there's this very unsettled feeling

500
00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:39.736
about all of it right now.

501
00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:41.692
What is just your, just more from,

502
00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:43.440
just speculation, intuition,

503
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.405
whatever you want to call it.

504
00:19:44.405 --> 00:19:46.711
What do you think's coming up this next couple of years

505
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.205
on the political scene?

506
00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:50.877
<v ->I think Barak Obama's an interesting guy</v>

507
00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:55.312
because he is not, they say oh he's tapped into the cultural

508
00:19:55.312 --> 00:19:57.385
meme that's happening,

509
00:19:57.385 --> 00:19:58.853
but I don't think that's what's happening.

510
00:19:58.853 --> 00:20:01.590
I think the cultural meme is tapping into Barak.

511
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.110
And that's why it rejected Hillary who had

512
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.359
the Clinton machine behind her.

513
00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:07.625
Frankly, I don't understand how anyone

514
00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:08.854
could beat the Clinton machine,

515
00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:11.268
because I know the Clinton machine and it is serious.

516
00:20:11.268 --> 00:20:14.631
So just that point alone, the guy deserves kuddos.

517
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.406
Just by defeating that.

518
00:20:16.406 --> 00:20:19.639
But he, I've noticed and watched,

519
00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:23.866
he is almost like an adaptoid

520
00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:25.716
to what is happening as.

521
00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:27.383
He's not really a leader.

522
00:20:27.383 --> 00:20:31.155
He is a person who's a mirror

523
00:20:31.155 --> 00:20:33.086
of the collective unconscious.

524
00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:34.823
Now is he going to succeed?

525
00:20:34.823 --> 00:20:36.113
I hope he does.

526
00:20:36.113 --> 00:20:37.187
But he probably won't.

527
00:20:37.187 --> 00:20:38.187
Why?

528
00:20:38.187 --> 00:20:40.562
Because the powers that be are so entrenched,

529
00:20:40.562 --> 00:20:42.465
and they're not going to let it happen.

530
00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:44.995
God forbid if something horrible happens.

531
00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:49.404
So I think that he, if he's elected

532
00:20:49.404 --> 00:20:50.563
or if he isn't elected.

533
00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:53.303
Actually if he isn't elected it may actually

534
00:20:53.303 --> 00:20:55.142
cause a revolution to happen.

535
00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:58.941
If he is elected it may hold it off for a couple of years,

536
00:20:58.941 --> 00:21:02.355
but I still think that something is going

537
00:21:02.355 --> 00:21:03.889
to happen in a couple of years.

538
00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:06.249
And it's our choice, is this going to be

539
00:21:06.249 --> 00:21:10.211
a violent revolution where we have Robes Piere killing

540
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:11.694
people in the streets of Paris,

541
00:21:11.694 --> 00:21:13.523
or is it going to be a revolution

542
00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.560
more akin to the Velvet Revolution of Czechoslovakia

543
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.362
and Poland where no one died?

544
00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:20.536
And I think that's what we have to be going after,

545
00:21:20.536 --> 00:21:23.299
a Ghandi like rebellion that says no,

546
00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:24.670
we're not going to fight you.

547
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.474
We're not cooperating with you.

548
00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:29.465
There's this great scene in the movie Ghandi.

549
00:21:30.485 --> 00:21:32.241
I forget the name of the actor, great British actor.

550
00:21:32.241 --> 00:21:36.152
He walks up to Ghandi played by Ben Kingsley

551
00:21:36.152 --> 00:21:36.850
and he says, (British accent)

552
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.187
"Well, you don't expect the British to just walk

553
00:21:40.187 --> 00:21:41.790
"out of India do you?",

554
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.426
and Ghandi goes,

555
00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:45.423
"Oh, oh no I don't expect you to walk out.

556
00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:48.287
"There's trains and there's boats, you know,

557
00:21:48.287 --> 00:21:49.730
"you can go there." (laughter)

558
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.052
And that's how we have to do it.

559
00:21:51.052 --> 00:21:53.197
We have to say, we're just staying here.

560
00:21:53.197 --> 00:21:55.533
We're not going anywhere and you guys

561
00:21:55.533 --> 00:21:56.569
are gonna have to deal with it.

562
00:21:56.569 --> 00:21:59.302
And that takes courage and that's what we're lacking today.

563
00:21:59.302 --> 00:22:01.710
That's why I get back to this thing about men.

564
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.514
I'm a firm believer of male initiation

565
00:22:04.514 --> 00:22:06.576
and we don't initiate males in our world.

566
00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:09.350
And what initiation does especially for males,

567
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.316
is it teaches us how to not be afraid.

568
00:22:12.316 --> 00:22:14.348
And so if we don't initiate males,

569
00:22:14.348 --> 00:22:15.912
they will initiate themselves.

570
00:22:15.912 --> 00:22:17.854
Whether it's snow boarding down a 14,000

571
00:22:17.854 --> 00:22:19.926
foot mountainside, joining the military

572
00:22:19.926 --> 00:22:21.226
and killing people in Iraq,

573
00:22:21.226 --> 00:22:23.268
drinking themselves into oblivion.

574
00:22:23.268 --> 00:22:26.366
This is a male problem that we're dealing with today.

575
00:22:26.366 --> 00:22:29.800
It's a repercussion of the patriarchy that's been here

576
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.161
for five or six thousand years.

577
00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:33.772
But we lost the ability to initiate males

578
00:22:33.772 --> 00:22:35.306
through this process.

579
00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:40.111
And so there's unleashed male energy on the earth

580
00:22:40.111 --> 00:22:44.175
right now and it's the single most dangerous force there is,

581
00:22:44.175 --> 00:22:47.283
and if it is not abated soon,

582
00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:51.723
it will turn into war lords and gigantic gangs of armed men,

583
00:22:51.723 --> 00:22:54.191
and this is something that is on the horizon

584
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:56.893
that we really have to be careful of.

585
00:22:56.893 --> 00:22:59.797
And so that is one of the reasons why I'm saying

586
00:22:59.797 --> 00:23:00.996
a lot of the things that I'm saying,

587
00:23:00.996 --> 00:23:03.769
because I've talked to the experts who have done

588
00:23:03.769 --> 00:23:06.274
their projections and they're very afraid.

589
00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:08.544
And believe me the members of Congress

590
00:23:08.544 --> 00:23:10.210
and the members of Senate

591
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.080
and the Executive branch they know of these reports.

592
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.086
They know.

593
00:23:15.086 --> 00:23:16.620
That's why they're doing what they're doing.

594
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.489
They're very afraid of what's about to happen.

595
00:23:18.489 --> 00:23:22.827
And we need to take male energy and direct

596
00:23:22.827 --> 00:23:27.662
it into a courageous masculine environment.

597
00:23:27.662 --> 00:23:30.456
Not one that goes and seeks to destroy,

598
00:23:30.456 --> 00:23:32.193
but one that says, no, no, no.

599
00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:36.399
I'm in control of my life and I don't need you, okay.

600
00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:41.275
And when that happens, it'll all end and women

601
00:23:41.275 --> 00:23:45.308
need to come forth and show us how to be courageous.

602
00:23:45.308 --> 00:23:47.697
It's the Joan of Arch model.

603
00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:51.249
You know, France is being subjected by the English

604
00:23:51.249 --> 00:23:52.620
and they were being destroyed.

605
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.119
The English actually had a plan to destroy France.

606
00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:57.679
And Joah of Arch, this 14 year old girl, you know,

607
00:23:57.679 --> 00:24:01.560
rose up and beat the biggest power on earth

608
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.433
and drove them back accross the English Channel.

609
00:24:03.433 --> 00:24:04.591
Excuse me.

610
00:24:04.591 --> 00:24:08.258
And changed France and saved France.

611
00:24:08.258 --> 00:24:09.132
And she's now a saint,

612
00:24:09.132 --> 00:24:11.174
but she was burned at the stake by the same church

613
00:24:11.174 --> 00:24:12.870
that later made her a saint.

614
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.106
And this is the model that women need to,

615
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:18.075
they need to rise up and say to men,

616
00:24:18.075 --> 00:24:20.148
I am brave.

617
00:24:20.148 --> 00:24:22.078
Am I braver than you?

618
00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:23.551
And believe me there's nothing a man

619
00:24:23.551 --> 00:24:28.153
wants more than to prove that he is courageous and brave.

620
00:24:28.153 --> 00:24:29.484
<v Voiceover>I know a lot of brave women.</v>

621
00:24:29.484 --> 00:24:31.393
There's a lot of opportunity to match it out there.

622
00:24:31.393 --> 00:24:31.962
<v ->I agree.</v>

623
00:24:31.962 --> 00:24:33.557
<v Voiceover>People like you are standing up to the plate.</v>

624
00:24:33.557 --> 00:24:35.091
Any final thoughts?

625
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:39.210
<v ->What's going on in 2012 is we're reaching a collective</v>

626
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.401
conclusion about what kind of world we want post 2012.

627
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:45.768
And for the first time in human history,

628
00:24:45.768 --> 00:24:49.446
we're all thinking about that world in mass.

629
00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:53.143
And whatever it is that we are going to create,

630
00:24:53.143 --> 00:24:56.618
we're going to start here and now to create this world.

631
00:24:56.618 --> 00:24:58.020
And so it's our choice.

632
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.376
Do you want a world of violence and fascism

633
00:25:00.376 --> 00:25:02.227
and environmental degridation?

634
00:25:02.227 --> 00:25:03.828
Or do you want a world where people cooperate

635
00:25:03.828 --> 00:25:05.022
with each other,

636
00:25:05.022 --> 00:25:06.156
where the food is high quality,

637
00:25:06.156 --> 00:25:07.993
where we sit around listening to music

638
00:25:07.993 --> 00:25:09.730
and singing around the fire

639
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.132
and loving each other.

640
00:25:11.132 --> 00:25:12.432
That's the choice.

641
00:25:12.432 --> 00:25:13.265
<v Voiceover>I choose that one.</v>

642
00:25:13.265 --> 00:25:13.865
<v ->Me too.</v>

643
00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:14.370
<v Voiceover>Thank you jay.</v>

644
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.467
(calm music)

645
00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:18.159
<v ->You can pick up a copy of Jay's documentary,</v>

646

649
00:25:24.316 --> 00:25:27.008
Meanwhile, we have other perspectives on 2012,

650
00:25:27.008 --> 00:25:28.552
not the least of which is our interview

651
00:25:28.552 --> 00:25:31.254
with John Major Jenkins which you may also enjoy.

652
00:25:31.254 --> 00:25:33.844
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
