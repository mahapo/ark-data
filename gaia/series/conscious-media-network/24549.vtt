00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:03.071
<v ->The story of Cathy O'Brien is perhaps the darkest</v>

2
00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:04.891
I've ever been exposed to,

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:07.514
but in the end, it's also a story of hope.

4
00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:08.874
All of what you're about to hear

5
00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.406
is a matter of public record,

6
00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:11.907
and has been documented in a book

7
00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:14.146
called Trance Formation of America.

8
00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.738
The book is based on transcripts of her testimony

9
00:00:16.738 --> 00:00:19.699
before a special federal investigative committee.

10
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.133
Cathy is a recovered survivor of the CIA MK-ULTRA

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.854
mind control operation called Project Monarch.

12
00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:28.193
Those who abused her

13
00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:29.853
were at the highest levels of government.

14
00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:32.653
The tragedy of her exploitation began at birth

15
00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:34.853
and continued until the age of 31

16
00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:37.493
when she was rescued by Mark Phillips.

(eerie music)

18
00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:49.294
<v ->When I was born into a multi-generational,</v>

19
00:00:49.294 --> 00:00:52.916
incest-based family in 1957

20
00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:55.416
in 1957 in Muskegon, Michigan,

21
00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:58.207
the knowledge on mind control

22
00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:00.667
was already in place

23
00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.427
and what the Hitler Himmler research

24
00:01:03.427 --> 00:01:07.447
had uncovered regarding multi-generational, incest-based

25
00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:10.947
or abuse-based families, they found

26
00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.908
that those children

27
00:01:12.908 --> 00:01:15.868
would tend to abuse their children when they had 'em,

28
00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:17.527
and so it would go.

29
00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:19.828
It created a cycle after three generations,

30
00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:23.527
and they knew that once the cycle was started

31
00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:25.927
and once this kind of abuse was going on

32
00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:28.988
that the children would be most likely suffering

33
00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.247
from a dissociative identity disorder.

34
00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:34.919
It was formerly mis-termed

35
00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:37.658
multiple personality disorder

36
00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:40.252
but in fact it's not multiple personalities.

37
00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:43.739
We have one, but it's where that one personality

38
00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.438
gets shattered and compartmentalized by abuse

39
00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:51.358
and when so much compartmentalization happens

40
00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:54.979
within the brain, then the subconscious mind

41
00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.378
is wide open and easily led.

42
00:01:57.378 --> 00:02:00.658
This is what the Hitler Himmler research had found.

43
00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:02.138
<v Voiceover>Because they were working heavily</v>

44
00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:03.878
on mind control all through the '30s.

45
00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:05.378
The '40s especially.

46
00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:07.238
<v ->All through Nazi Germany.</v>

47
00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:08.262
Yes, absolutely.

48
00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:09.482
It was so strong in Nazi Germany

49
00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:11.782
and that was before the kind of technologies

50
00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:14.142
that we have today which have just

51
00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:17.362
really accelerated and amplified mind control.

52
00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:19.782
<v Voiceover>And just to, I'll just supply</v>

53
00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:20.842
a tiny piece of data here.

54
00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:23.982
A lot of these quote mind control researchers

55
00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:26.922
under the guise of physicists and so forth

56
00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:29.702
were brought into the country at the end of World War II

57
00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:31.843
under Project Paperclip, so we know we inherited

58
00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:34.662
a lot of Nazi scientists at that time.

59
00:02:34.662 --> 00:02:37.003
<v ->And so this information was full into the country</v>

60
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:40.522
by 1957 when I was born,

61
00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:44.641
and so this multi-generational incest-based family

62
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.742
had a very traumatic effect on me.

63
00:02:47.742 --> 00:02:51.422
It's not that I could think to morally judge it

64
00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:53.142
or to know anything like that.

65
00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:54.982
I mean I was just a little itty-bitty child.

66
00:02:54.982 --> 00:02:56.742
<v Voiceover>How young were you when the abuse began?</v>

67
00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:57.982
<v ->Yeah.</v>

68
00:02:57.982 --> 00:02:59.102
<v Voiceover>You personally.</v>

69
00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:01.142
How young were you when the abuse in your family began?

70
00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:02.662
<v ->As far back as I can remember.</v>

71
00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:04.743
I can remember back to when I was nine months old

72
00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:06.742
because the brain photographically

73
00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.562
records the events surrounding trauma,

74
00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:11.342
and the trauma of my childhood was extreme,

75
00:03:11.342 --> 00:03:14.821
and those are the farthest back memories that I've ever had,

76
00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:17.302
and the sexual abuse that I endured,

77
00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:19.042
even though I couldn't judge it,

78
00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.543
my brain automatically responded to that abuse

79
00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:24.982
the way that all of our brains do.

80
00:03:24.982 --> 00:03:27.362
It's a natural brain function

81
00:03:27.362 --> 00:03:30.543
to compartmentalize the memory of the trauma

82
00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.262
so the rest of the mind can function normally

83
00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:35.183
as though nothing had happened,

84
00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:38.772
so my father's sexual abuse of me

85
00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:42.313
was extreme, and I learned

86
00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:44.893
as I grew and grew and grew

87
00:03:44.893 --> 00:03:47.654
how to deal with that sexual abuse

88
00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:51.493
and that part of my brain was used to dealing with it

89
00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:53.674
while the rest of my mind functioned normally.

90
00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:54.913
I couldn't think to bring to mind

91
00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.493
the fact that my father was sexually abusing me

92
00:03:57.493 --> 00:03:59.334
when I was anyplace else.

93
00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:01.793
When I was playing with friends,

94
00:04:01.793 --> 00:04:04.034
when I eventually went to school,

95
00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:05.833
anything like that, I never could think

96
00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:07.254
to bring that to mind.

97
00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:08.234
<v Voiceover>It didn't exist</v>

98
00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:09.314
with that other part
<v Cathy>No.</v>

99
00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:10.693
of your personality.
<v Cathy>Right.</v>

100
00:04:10.693 --> 00:04:11.913
Because it was sectioned off

101
00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:14.594
the way that the brain compartmentalizes that memory.

102
00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:18.113
Then, when my father would come in to sexually abuse me,

103
00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:21.714
the part of my brain that was used to that kind of abuse

104
00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:25.334
would be triggered open to deal with that abuse

105
00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:27.893
again and again and again as needed,

106
00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:31.373
and this is the kind of dissociative identity disorder

107
00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:34.594
that I was suffering from.

108
00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:37.253
When a brain develops so many compartments,

109
00:04:37.253 --> 00:04:41.314
there's no ability for any kind of continuity of thought

110
00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.514
because there's no awareness, there's no conscious awareness

111
00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.354
what happened over here, what happened over here,

112
00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:51.134
and without that continuity of conscious awareness,

113
00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:54.173
there's no concept of time.

114
00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:58.394
So I completely had no concept of time.

115
00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:01.554
Matter of fact, I didn't know how old I was.

116
00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:04.993
I had no ability to even think in those kind of terms.

117
00:05:04.993 --> 00:05:08.493
There was no flow or continuity.

118
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:09.634
<v Voiceover>So were you living</v>

119
00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:11.534
kind of in a fairy-tale world the rest of the time,

120
00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:13.434
in a world of your own making?

121
00:05:13.434 --> 00:05:14.494
<v ->Not really.</v>

122
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:16.893
I couldn't even think to do that.

123
00:05:16.893 --> 00:05:21.034
Pretty early on, I was losing an ability to even do that.

124
00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:24.733
Instead, it was more like living only in the moment,

125
00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:26.754
only in the present, and responding

126
00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:30.254
to whatever I was being exposed to,

127
00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:32.894
so my life was, in essence, leading me.

128
00:05:32.894 --> 00:05:34.574
I wasn't leading a life.

129
00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:38.046
And there's a criminal faction

130
00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.485
of the US Govenment

131
00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:44.486
that was actively involved in MK-ULTRA mind control

132
00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:48.165
when the Nazi and Fascist scientists were brought into

133
00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:50.326
the United States it was as though, you know,

134
00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:54.086
we didn't win the war against Nazi Germany.

135
00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:56.866
Instead, we just simply transferred it over here,

136
00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:59.786
and it was being used on the population

137
00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:03.266
either in a form of mass mind control

138
00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:05.925
which is very prevalent today

139
00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:08.425
through social engineering and manipulation

140
00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:12.396
through the medias, and information control,

141
00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:16.901
which are all very strong forms of mass mind control,

142
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.722
or it can be the kind of absolute,

143
00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:23.741
total robotic mind control that I experienced.

144
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:25.141
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

145
00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:27.501
<v ->And there was a local politician, at the time,</v>

146
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.004
that was actually sanctioning

147
00:06:31.004 --> 00:06:34.364
the kind of abuse that I was going through.

148
00:06:34.364 --> 00:06:36.244
My father's sexual abuse of me

149
00:06:36.244 --> 00:06:38.843
had extended into child pornography,

150
00:06:38.843 --> 00:06:41.203
and he was selling the child pornography

151
00:06:41.203 --> 00:06:42.803
through the local Michigan

152
00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:45.143
Mafia child pornography ring.

153
00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:47.645
He only had a sixth grade education.

154
00:06:47.645 --> 00:06:50.725
Earned his living as a worm digger,

155
00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:53.184
and so he was supplementing the family income

156
00:06:53.184 --> 00:06:56.825
with the proceeds from child pornography of me.

157
00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:59.905
This local politician knew that

158
00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:02.624
any child that was so abused

159
00:07:02.624 --> 00:07:05.425
as to be used in pornography

160
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.325
would be suffering from this

161
00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:09.584
disassociative identity disorder,

162
00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:11.544
which made me a prime candidate,

163
00:07:11.544 --> 00:07:14.485
or a chosen one, for MK-ULTRA mind control.

164
00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:15.965
It was so well known

165
00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.484
that with that kind of compartmentalization

166
00:07:18.484 --> 00:07:20.105
that would leave the subconscious mind

167
00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.064
open to be easily lead.

168
00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:23.684
The subconscious mind doesn't have

169
00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:25.545
any ability to reason,

170
00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.945
and ability to consciously comprehend,

171
00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:29.865
any ability to question,

172
00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:32.044
or to do anything other than exactly

173
00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:35.005
what it is told to do.

174
00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:37.760
So, this local politician

175
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.660
approached my father

176
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.980
and told him that he could have

177
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.141
immunity from prosecution

178
00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:44.540
if he would agree to sell me

179
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.144
in MKULTRA mind control.

180
00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:48.923
And my father thought that was great.

181
00:07:48.923 --> 00:07:50.244
He thought, "Well, this is wonderful.

182
00:07:50.244 --> 00:07:52.404
"The government condones child abuse."

183
00:07:52.404 --> 00:07:53.583
<v Voiceover>So, for what purpose</v>

184
00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:56.526
did they want to have you sold

185
00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:58.883
into MKULTRA mind control?

186
00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:00.383
<v ->There's various reasons why they</v>

187
00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:02.164
were targeting children like myself.

188
00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:03.743
Many of them were being targeted

189
00:08:03.743 --> 00:08:06.103
for military special forces.

190
00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:08.963
Many were being targeted for the intelligence community.

191
00:08:08.963 --> 00:08:12.563
In my case, that was the direction

192
00:08:12.563 --> 00:08:15.264
that I was used, eventually,

193
00:08:15.264 --> 00:08:17.904
througout my mind control victimization.

194
00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:20.543
I was used on a White House, Pentagon level.

195
00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:22.503
Because I had been sexually abused

196
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.364
and my sexuality was heightened,

197
00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:26.724
that was a focus of the abuse,

198
00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:29.663
where I would be used sexually

199
00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:32.513
with various politicians and

200
00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.444
deliver government secrets

201
00:08:35.444 --> 00:08:38.003
at a time like that.

202
00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:40.823
Because they believed, what better place

203
00:08:40.823 --> 00:08:42.864
to store government secrets,

204
00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:45.824
than in the mind of someone

205
00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:48.483
who can't think to bring

206
00:08:48.483 --> 00:08:51.683
these memories to mind

207
00:08:51.683 --> 00:08:53.123
to tell somebody.

208
00:08:53.123 --> 00:08:55.283
They thought it was a good place to store secrets.

209
00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:58.644
Because another automatic function

210
00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:01.083
of the brain, when it is exposed

211
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:03.564
to trauma, is that it photographically

212
00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:06.444
records events surrounding trauma.

213
00:09:06.444 --> 00:09:09.184
So, there's like a photographic memory

214
00:09:09.184 --> 00:09:11.025
within this little compartment,

215
00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:13.935
even though it can't be remembered over here,

216
00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:15.375
and thought to be brought to mind,

217
00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:16.955
there's still, never the less,

218
00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:19.475
a photographic memory within that compartment,

219
00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:22.215
and that's where the goverment's secrets were stored.

220
00:09:22.215 --> 00:09:23.675
<v Voiceover>Toward what end?</v>

221
00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:25.114
Just so I'm clear on this,

222
00:09:25.114 --> 00:09:26.355
they would store secrets

223
00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:27.834
to be used toward what end?

224
00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:28.728
What was the--

225
00:09:28.728 --> 00:09:31.406
<v ->The various operations that I would be used in</v>

226
00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:32.725
throughout my victimization

227
00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:34.905
because this particular politician

228
00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:37.326
went on to become the unelected president

229
00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.726
of the United States, and that's Gerald Ford.

230
00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:42.826
<v Voiceover>That was the Michigan politician</v>

231
00:09:42.826 --> 00:09:43.946
that brought you--

232
00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:45.706
<v ->He was just a local politician at the time,</v>

233
00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:48.006
went into state politics

234
00:09:48.006 --> 00:09:51.286
and became the unelected president of the United States.

235
00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:54.025
Seemingly bizarre set of circumstances,

236
00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:57.445
but it was also natural to my experience

237
00:09:59.575 --> 00:10:02.346
and my existence under mind control.

238
00:10:02.346 --> 00:10:04.386
<v Voiceover>Let's go back for a moment.</v>

239
00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:08.746
When they first started making contact with you

240
00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:11.265
and bringing you into their

241
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.660
environment, what happened there,

242
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.460
and how old were you by then?

243
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.260
<v ->I was about six years old</v>

244
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.140
when I was thrust into it fully,

245
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.800
and when I began to loose

246
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.680
any free thought whatsoever.

247
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.437
Up until that time, I remember having

248
00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:29.857
thoughts of wishing that there was a place

249
00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:32.638
in the world where children weren't abused,

250
00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:34.078
that there was a place where people

251
00:10:34.078 --> 00:10:35.678
didn't hurt each other,

252
00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:37.817
and even though I didn't necessarily

253
00:10:37.817 --> 00:10:41.178
perceive sexually abuse as abuse,

254
00:10:41.178 --> 00:10:44.058
it just wasn't right,

255
00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:46.419
and it just didn't feel good,

256
00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:50.459
and it was very traumatic to me, nevertheless.

257
00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:53.118
So, I had hoped there was some place

258
00:10:53.118 --> 00:10:54.980
where people weren't abused.

259
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.898
I lost my capacity for that

260
00:10:56.898 --> 00:10:58.938
was I was sold into the project,

261
00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:02.516
and Gerald Ford had instructed my father

262
00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:05.156
to go to Boston, Massachusetts

263
00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:07.726
for further instruction in how

264
00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:10.585
to raise me in the project.

265
00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:13.545
<v Voiceover>All of this is a matter of extreme</v>

266
00:11:13.545 --> 00:11:15.206
public record.
<v Cathy>Yes, it is.</v>

267
00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:17.826
<v Voiceover>You have been before Senate committees,</v>

268
00:11:17.826 --> 00:11:19.505
before House committees.

269
00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:20.786
This is on record.

270
00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:23.046
This is compiled from transcripts in the book.

271
00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:24.706
<v ->It is, and it was testimony</v>

272
00:11:24.706 --> 00:11:26.986
to the US Permanent

273
00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:29.826
Select Committee on Intelligence Oversight,

274
00:11:29.826 --> 00:11:33.585
and it was released en masse in a book

275
00:11:33.585 --> 00:11:36.965
in 1995, called Trance Formation of America.

276
00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:39.566
That book was released on the advice

277
00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:42.646
of a federal attorney, our attorney,

278
00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:46.506
who said that, at that point,

279
00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:48.526
that it would be the only way

280
00:11:48.526 --> 00:11:50.126
we'd be able to survive,

281
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.466
was to get the information out publicly.

282
00:11:52.466 --> 00:11:55.166
I never dreamed that anybody would care

283
00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:57.646
to know about my victimization.

284
00:11:57.646 --> 00:12:00.886
Mind control is so prevalent in our society,

285
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.946
and so many people are affected by it,

286
00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:07.545
in various levels, particularly in the military

287
00:12:07.545 --> 00:12:10.196
and in military intelligence that

288
00:12:11.576 --> 00:12:15.228
Trance is now in its 14th edition

289
00:12:15.228 --> 00:12:18.348
and that's just printed,

290
00:12:18.348 --> 00:12:21.067
we had it self-published,

291
00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:23.715
and it's now in its 14th edition.

292
00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:27.475
It's in over 10 languages in 40 countries world-wide,

293
00:12:27.475 --> 00:12:31.095
and it's used in various universities,

294
00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:33.014
such as the Oxford Law Library,

295
00:12:33.014 --> 00:12:36.254
to help bring the information, these facts,

296
00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:38.715
these documented and proven facts to light,

297
00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:41.015
that mind control does exist,

298
00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:43.915
and that it's being used against individuals

299
00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:45.795
on a world-wide basis,

300
00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:48.756
but it's also being used against society

301
00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:51.555
as a whole whenever there's a trauma

302
00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.876
that happens in...

303
00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:56.437
Such as when 911 happened

304
00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.596
in the United States.

305
00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:01.816
That devestated the whole nation.

306
00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:03.396
<v Voiceover>Left us very open and suggestable</v>

307
00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:05.056
to what has come down since.

308
00:13:05.056 --> 00:13:07.717
<v ->It did, it left people easily led,</v>

309
00:13:07.717 --> 00:13:09.957
and that was a pattern that followed

310
00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:11.496
directly into what had happened,

311
00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:12.956
even in Nazi Germany

312
00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:15.036
with the Reichstag when that

313
00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:19.351
trauma happened to that nation

314
00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:21.511
and people were easily led then

315
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:23.211
because when people are traumatized

316
00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:25.172
they don't have the ability to consciously

317
00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:26.573
think for themselves,

318
00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:28.231
and they're just ready to be led, you know,

319
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:30.411
"Tell me what to do", kind of thing,

320
00:13:30.411 --> 00:13:32.871
and they look to the government leaders

321
00:13:32.871 --> 00:13:35.190
to lead them, when in fact,

322
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.091
it was this handful of criminals in the government

323
00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:40.711
that were actually misleading the people

324
00:13:40.711 --> 00:13:43.090
to deliberately take control of them

325
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.430
the same way they had taken control

326
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.912
of my mind as a very young child.

327
00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.333
<v Voiceover>So, let's go back to that.</v>

328
00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:52.652
So, you were introduced.

329
00:13:52.652 --> 00:13:54.993
How did you first end up in their company?

330
00:13:54.993 --> 00:13:56.353
How did this happen?

331
00:13:56.353 --> 00:13:59.524
<v ->Once I was thrust into</v>

332
00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:01.704
MKULTRA mind control,

333
00:14:01.704 --> 00:14:04.144
my father was flown to Boston, Massachusetts

334
00:14:04.144 --> 00:14:06.505
where there is a criminal faction of the

335
00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:09.344
Catholic Church, which also funded Adolf Hitler.

336
00:14:09.344 --> 00:14:10.925
I mean, there's all kinds of public records

337
00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:12.904
of that when you follow the money.

338
00:14:12.904 --> 00:14:15.204
This criminal faction of the Catholic Church,

339
00:14:15.204 --> 00:14:16.945
which I was being raised in,

340
00:14:17.895 --> 00:14:20.725
would take the information that they had learned

341
00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:23.184
about the effects of trauma on the human mind

342
00:14:23.184 --> 00:14:25.646
through such things as the Spanish Inquisition

343
00:14:25.646 --> 00:14:26.946
and the Crusades,

344
00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:29.653
combine it with the Hitler-Himmler research,

345
00:14:29.653 --> 00:14:33.188
and further combine it with what the CIA

346
00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:36.089
now knew about

347
00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:38.469
technological aspects that were just

348
00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:41.189
coming into play, and this whole combination

349
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:43.508
of mind control was becoming a very

350
00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.586
powerful form of

351
00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:48.327
mind control.

352
00:14:48.327 --> 00:14:50.677
Of course, now we know that the

353
00:14:51.987 --> 00:14:54.138
Boston connection,

354
00:14:55.608 --> 00:14:57.427
the abuse in the Catholic Church

355
00:14:57.427 --> 00:15:00.368
came to light, and emanated out of Boston.

356
00:15:00.368 --> 00:15:02.908
It was a very deliberate and systematic

357
00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:05.888
abuse of children for the purposes

358
00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:07.467
of mind control.

359
00:15:07.467 --> 00:15:10.108
There was perversion deversion used

360
00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:11.968
to emotionally mislead people away

361
00:15:11.968 --> 00:15:14.087
from the fact that children were being abused

362
00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:15.627
for a deliberate purpose,

363
00:15:15.627 --> 00:15:18.228
and instead they were saying it was homosexuality

364
00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:21.368
because if they can emotionally mislead people

365
00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:23.807
in another direction and divert them

366
00:15:23.807 --> 00:15:26.408
with a perversion diversion in some other direction,

367
00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:28.628
they're not looking at the reality of the facts

368
00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:31.417
of what was really going on.

369
00:15:31.417 --> 00:15:33.437
And at that particular time,

370
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.450
this whole criminal faction was being led

371
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.990
by a Cardinal Law, who was since caught,

372
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.830
and this whole catholic child abuse scandal

373
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.789
that was going on.

374
00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:49.030
<v Voiceover>He didn't go down though.</v>

375
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.630
<v ->No, he did not.</v>

376
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.271
As a matter of fact,

377
00:15:52.271 --> 00:15:54.990
the governor of Michigan, at that time,

378
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.210
was another person that I was exposed to,

379
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.110
in MKULTRA mind control at the instruction

380
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.150
of Gerald Ford, and the governor

381
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.410
at the time was George Romney.

382
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.190
This George Romney is the father

383
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.210
of Mitt Romney who is currently running

384
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.410
for the president of the United States.

385
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.220
Mitt Romney was like 12 years old

386
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.831
when I was a little, bitty thing.

387
00:16:16.831 --> 00:16:18.452
He was a little bit older than I was,

388
00:16:18.452 --> 00:16:20.641
but nevertheless,

389
00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:23.021
his father was actively involved

390
00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:26.181
in bringing mind control into a much more powerful

391
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:29.101
form into the Mormon Church,

392
00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:32.361
and it was perpetuated and it has...

393
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:33.821
As a matter of fact, the Mormon Church

394
00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:36.421
is the number one place where our

395
00:16:36.421 --> 00:16:39.001
FBI is drawn from because once they

396
00:16:39.001 --> 00:16:40.401
complete their mission, they're already

397
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:43.021
so robotically compliant they just automatically

398
00:16:43.021 --> 00:16:45.561
go into doing exactly what the government

399
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:49.801
tells them to do for that aspect of things.

400
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.741
It's interesting to note that Mitt Romney

401
00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:56.081
was governor of Massachusetts

402
00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:59.559
at the time of the catholic child abuse scandal,

403
00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:02.819
and was instrumental in, not only

404
00:17:02.819 --> 00:17:06.080
covering that up and perpetuating the diversion,

405
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.659
but Cardinal Law

406
00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:10.739
was sent to the Vatican.

407
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.319
He was given a transfer

408
00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.300
like so many priests are transferred around

409
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.779
whenever they're caught in this kind of child abuse.

410
00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:19.759
He was transferred and given a promotion

411
00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:22.999
to one of the highest positions in the Catholic Church,

412
00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:26.049
and even said the eulogy for

413
00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:30.139
when the pope died not too long ago,

414
00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:33.379
so he's given a very prestigious position instead.

415
00:17:33.379 --> 00:17:36.599
So, this mind control is very prevalent,

416
00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:39.959
and it's very well controlled

417
00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:43.439
through the distinct placement of certain individuals

418
00:17:43.439 --> 00:17:47.139
very high up, either in the religious aspect,

419
00:17:47.139 --> 00:17:50.779
but most likely in politics worldwide.

420
00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.479
<v Voiceover>So, how was your experience?</v>

421
00:17:52.479 --> 00:17:53.639
Now, you're only, what,

422
00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:54.880
six years old or so?
<v Cathy>Right.</v>

423
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.959
<v Voiceover>You're in the company of these</v>

424
00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:57.499
high-powered politicians.
<v Cathy>Yes.</v>

425
00:17:57.499 --> 00:17:58.799
<v Voiceover>For what purpose?</v>

426
00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:00.239
How was your treatment?

427
00:18:00.239 --> 00:18:01.779
What went on?

428
00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:04.139
<v ->Fulfilling perversions</v>

429
00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:06.959
which would also traumatize me further

430
00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:09.880
for the different criminal covert operations

431
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.939
that I would be used in by the CIA

432
00:18:12.939 --> 00:18:15.820
and the DIA on a White House, Pentagon level.

433
00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.219
The catholic abuse that I was exposed to

434
00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.959
at that time, included sexual abuse by priests,

435
00:18:22.959 --> 00:18:24.979
which is very traumatic

436
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.339
to a young child because I felt like

437
00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:28.779
I had no where to turn.

438
00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:29.839
I mean, who could I turn to?

439
00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:31.239
I couldn't turn to my parents.

440
00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:32.739
I couldn't turn to local politicians.

441
00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:34.219
I coudn't turn to my church.

442
00:18:34.219 --> 00:18:35.600
It seemed like there was nobody.

443
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.419
I couldn't turn to my relatives.

444
00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:38.839
<v Voiceover>You couldn't tell anybody anything?</v>

445
00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:40.159
<v ->There was nobody,</v>

446
00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:42.919
and it was the way things were

447
00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:45.919
for me growing up because mind control

448
00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:48.979
had taken that much of a grip

449
00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:52.319
on our society by

450
00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.879
that time.

451
00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:57.699
That was very, very difficult,

452
00:18:57.699 --> 00:19:01.609
but the catholic abuse also included ritual abuse.

453
00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:05.749
Many people are exposed to Satanic traumas

454
00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:08.299
and blood traumas

455
00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:10.079
which is extremely traumatic and creates more

456
00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:12.491
compartments within the brain,

457
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:15.450
as the brain tries to deal with the horrors

458
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.810
and the traumas.
<v Voiceover>The sexual abuse</v>

459
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.431
you were already accustom to,
<v Cathy>Yes, yes.</v>

460
00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:21.071
<v Voiceover>by that young age,</v>

461
00:19:21.071 --> 00:19:22.790
so when that started happening

462
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.290
with these power players,

463
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.450
it was, in a sense, that was just going

464
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.370
into the same compartment that the other stuff

465
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.650
had gone into until they expanded the abuse

466
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.791
to new levels of abuse?

467
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:35.000
<v ->Yes, and as</v>

468
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.050
Gerald Ford's political career climbed

469
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.270
into the presidency so to did my victimization.

470
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.010
It just escalated on a political level,

471
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.070
quite rapidly.

472
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.611
<v Voiceover>How high did it end up going?</v>

473
00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:50.184
<v ->White House, Pentagon level,</v>

474
00:19:50.184 --> 00:19:53.045
and delivering messages to and from

475
00:19:53.045 --> 00:19:55.444
various government leaders,

476
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:59.684
including the King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,

477
00:19:59.684 --> 00:20:02.895
which is very instrumental in all the

478
00:20:04.105 --> 00:20:07.324
wars and turmoil that's going on there

479
00:20:07.324 --> 00:20:10.145
through Bander Bin Sultan,

480
00:20:10.145 --> 00:20:12.124
Prince Bander Bin Sultan

481
00:20:12.124 --> 00:20:13.635
who is

482
00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:18.284
a very strong friend of Dick Cheney and George Bush

483
00:20:18.284 --> 00:20:22.344
and was ambassador here, and--

484
00:20:22.344 --> 00:20:24.924
<v Voiceover>Were you in the company of Cheney</v>

485
00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:26.205
and the Bushes and others?

486
00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:27.264
<v ->Yes, I was.</v>

487
00:20:27.264 --> 00:20:28.604
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact,

488
00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:30.144
you look at Gerald Ford's cabinet

489
00:20:30.144 --> 00:20:32.514
and you can clearly see why

490
00:20:32.514 --> 00:20:35.085
because he had George Bush

491
00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:37.304
as the head of the CIA.

492
00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:40.984
He had Dick Cheney as his secretary of state,

493
00:20:40.984 --> 00:20:44.244
Donald Rumsfeld as his secretary of defense.

494
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.245
Those are the same people

495
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.545
that are in place today,

496
00:20:48.545 --> 00:20:50.524
and we keep looking at...

497
00:20:50.524 --> 00:20:52.984
We got the same people over and over

498
00:20:52.984 --> 00:20:56.637
and over again, and it's got to stop at some point.

499
00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:59.837
Even now, at this presidential election that's coming up,

500
00:20:59.837 --> 00:21:02.156
I'm still seeing the same people

501
00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:04.976
that I've seen all of my life.

502
00:21:04.976 --> 00:21:07.776
Mitt Romney running for president.

503
00:21:07.776 --> 00:21:11.916
Hillary Clinton running for office, and

504
00:21:13.046 --> 00:21:16.388
another person that I was exposed to,

505
00:21:16.388 --> 00:21:20.588
Bill Richardson who was actively involved in,

506
00:21:20.588 --> 00:21:23.508
not only the cocaine operations

507
00:21:23.508 --> 00:21:25.751
that were running out of Mena, Arkansas

508
00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.631
during Bill Clinton's years, but

509
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:33.262
he was also involved with DARPA

510
00:21:33.262 --> 00:21:36.572
and other aspects that are more

511
00:21:37.242 --> 00:21:39.522
classified and top secret.

512
00:21:39.522 --> 00:21:41.882
<v Voiceover>When you say involved with,</v>

513
00:21:41.882 --> 00:21:44.101
you were involved with these people?

514
00:21:44.101 --> 00:21:47.522
<v ->I was exposed to all of them for various reasons,</v>

515
00:21:47.522 --> 00:21:50.622
and one reason that kept me in contact

516
00:21:50.622 --> 00:21:53.142
with so many of them was the CIA's

517
00:21:53.142 --> 00:21:56.702
involvement in cocaine operations.

518
00:21:56.702 --> 00:21:59.982
That was very strong, and the cocaine operations

519
00:21:59.982 --> 00:22:02.412
were a funding mechanism for,

520
00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:06.221
and also part of an exchange for arms.

521
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:08.041
So, we had a whole lot of drugs

522
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:11.042
and weaponry that was going on

523
00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:15.983
to fund secret wars and to perpetuate

524
00:22:15.983 --> 00:22:19.163
the control of what was happening to...

525
00:22:19.163 --> 00:22:21.103
The controls that were happening in the United States

526
00:22:21.103 --> 00:22:23.763
were being expanded on a global scale.

527
00:22:23.763 --> 00:22:25.283
<v Voiceover>So, how were you utilized in the</v>

528
00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:27.463
illegal activities?

529
00:22:27.463 --> 00:22:30.043
<v ->Carrying drugs, muling a lot of drugs,</v>

530
00:22:30.043 --> 00:22:32.502
delivering messages to and from the government

531
00:22:32.502 --> 00:22:35.762
leaders, and the programming that I experienced

532
00:22:35.762 --> 00:22:37.722
was on various military

533
00:22:37.722 --> 00:22:40.683
and NASA installations.

534
00:22:40.683 --> 00:22:43.253
My owner in the project, who I meant when I was--

535
00:22:43.253 --> 00:22:45.064
<v Voiceover>Owner, you wanna explain owner?</v>

536
00:22:45.064 --> 00:22:48.504
<v ->Owner was the one who directed my activities,</v>

537
00:22:48.504 --> 00:22:50.964
and told me which projects that I would be

538
00:22:50.964 --> 00:22:53.524
used in and how I would be used

539
00:22:53.524 --> 00:22:55.625
on a White House, Pentagon level,

540
00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:57.884
even to the point of who I would be

541
00:22:57.884 --> 00:23:01.024
exposed to sexually, including him.

542
00:23:01.024 --> 00:23:02.924
At the age of 13, I was exposed to

543
00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:05.423
US Senator Robert C Byrd.

544
00:23:05.423 --> 00:23:07.643
That was my owner in the project.

545
00:23:07.643 --> 00:23:10.243
Senator Byrd has been in office

546
00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:11.803
as long as I've been alive.

547
00:23:11.803 --> 00:23:14.642
He's head of US Senate Appropriations.

548
00:23:14.642 --> 00:23:17.583
He decides where the money is going to go

549
00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:19.583
for funding,

550
00:23:21.513 --> 00:23:23.763
and one of the things he was funding

551
00:23:23.763 --> 00:23:27.103
was DARPA, which is where, in essence,

552
00:23:27.103 --> 00:23:29.664
the war machine, and where mind control

553
00:23:29.664 --> 00:23:31.524
was emanating from

554
00:23:31.524 --> 00:23:34.983
on a mass scale because of the computerization

555
00:23:34.983 --> 00:23:36.884
and the high techonologies

556
00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:39.904
that were involved in DARPA at the time.

557
00:23:39.904 --> 00:23:41.864
<v Voiceover>And you were aware of these things?</v>

558
00:23:41.864 --> 00:23:43.223
<v ->Absolutely, I was,</v>

559
00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:44.463
and his conduit...

560
00:23:44.463 --> 00:23:46.843
Since I was exposed to Senator Byrd all those years,

561
00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:50.524
from the time I was 13 till the time I was 30

562
00:23:50.524 --> 00:23:51.884
and Mark rescued me

563
00:23:51.884 --> 00:23:54.844
directly out of MK-ULTRA mind control,

564
00:23:57.194 --> 00:24:00.722
this Senator Byrd, I was in constant

565
00:24:01.382 --> 00:24:03.303
exposure to him

566
00:24:05.035 --> 00:24:07.251
and people that he had contact with,

567
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:09.531
such as Senator Leahy.

568
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.861
And Senator Leahy is

569
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.451
was funding DARPA, for example.

570
00:24:16.451 --> 00:24:19.551
He was the conduit of going in and making sure

571
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:22.911
that the criminal activity there was being funded.

572
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:25.170
Now, it's not that these,

573
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.550
the small hand full of criminals

574
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.450
see themselves as criminals.

575
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.950
They see themselves as justified

576
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.671
in their actions.

577
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:38.210
How they can justify such horrible activity

578
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.711
as mind control is

579
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.590
just beyond me,

580
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.771
but they're not capable of considering

581
00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:50.150
the strength of the human spirit.

582
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.051
They don't consider looking at

583
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:55.294
the soul.

584
00:24:55.294 --> 00:24:57.715
They never considered the power of love,

585
00:24:57.715 --> 00:24:59.155
and that's their downfall

586
00:24:59.155 --> 00:25:03.134
because as criminal minds lack depth.

587
00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:05.055
They lack wisdom,

588
00:25:05.055 --> 00:25:08.695
and love is the most powerful force in the universe.

589
00:25:08.695 --> 00:25:11.654
I know that know that I'm free

590
00:25:11.654 --> 00:25:13.454
to think for myself again,

591
00:25:13.454 --> 00:25:16.354
and was so lovingly rescued

592
00:25:17.264 --> 00:25:19.595
by Mark from my victimization.

593
00:25:19.595 --> 00:25:20.914
<v Voiceover>But you didn't know anything of</v>

594
00:25:20.914 --> 00:25:22.134
love during these times?

595
00:25:22.134 --> 00:25:23.635
That wasn't anything that was part of the equation?

596
00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:25.535
<v ->It wasn't part of the equation.</v>

597
00:25:25.535 --> 00:25:27.855
It is the essence of my being.

598
00:25:28.665 --> 00:25:32.654
Once Mark rescued me from MK-ULTRA mind control

599
00:25:32.654 --> 00:25:35.635
I had no idea how old I was.

600
00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:38.014
I didn't know where I had been.

601
00:25:38.014 --> 00:25:41.014
I was totally amnesic of those years,

602
00:25:41.014 --> 00:25:43.675
until I felt safe.

603
00:25:44.495 --> 00:25:47.474
And until I knew love for the first time,

604
00:25:47.474 --> 00:25:49.434
and nobody was hurting me.

605
00:25:49.434 --> 00:25:52.615
By that time, I had a daughter.

606
00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:55.165
Kelly was born into

607
00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:58.204
MK-ULTRA mind control in 1980.

608
00:25:58.204 --> 00:26:00.265
<v Voiceover>And who was the father?</v>

609
00:26:00.265 --> 00:26:02.665
<v ->Her father was Wayne Cox.</v>

610
00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:04.294
Wayne Cox is

611
00:26:05.245 --> 00:26:07.504
an assassin for the CIA

612
00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:10.864
that was using acultism as his

613
00:26:10.864 --> 00:26:14.385
basis for traumatizing others in mind control,

614
00:26:14.385 --> 00:26:17.205
but was also his own mode of operation

615
00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:20.445
for murdering people and disposing of bodies

616
00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:22.665
by dismembering them,

617
00:26:22.665 --> 00:26:24.785
and that was very traumatic

618
00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:26.825
and very horrific.

619
00:26:26.825 --> 00:26:30.284
It was also very effective in being able to keep secret,

620
00:26:30.284 --> 00:26:33.377
particularly, the Mena

621
00:26:34.817 --> 00:26:36.207
cocaine operations

622
00:26:36.207 --> 00:26:39.027
that Bill Clinton was so much a part of,

623
00:26:41.048 --> 00:26:43.588
prior to becoming president,

624
00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:46.108
but while he was governor of Arkansas,

625
00:26:46.108 --> 00:26:48.684
and attorney general of Arkansas,

626
00:26:48.684 --> 00:26:51.144
and Wayne Cox was

627
00:26:51.144 --> 00:26:54.525
involved in those particular operations.

628
00:26:54.525 --> 00:26:56.484
That's kind of what brought me into

629
00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:58.285
the cocaine operations and into that

630
00:26:58.285 --> 00:27:00.145
criminal faction of government,

631
00:27:00.145 --> 00:27:02.024
and also the extreme trauma.

632
00:27:02.024 --> 00:27:04.585
My daughter, Kelly, was born at that time.

633
00:27:04.585 --> 00:27:07.105
<v Voiceover>Was that intentional, do you think?</v>

634
00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:09.365
That you were to become pregnant?

635
00:27:09.365 --> 00:27:10.965
<v ->I do believe that it was intentional,</v>

636
00:27:10.965 --> 00:27:13.045
on their part, because who's gonna look twice

637
00:27:13.045 --> 00:27:16.045
at a woman and a child that are being involved

638
00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:19.684
in government operations on a global scale.

639
00:27:19.684 --> 00:27:21.365
It looks innocent.

640
00:27:21.365 --> 00:27:22.985
People don't look twice,

641
00:27:22.985 --> 00:27:25.465
especially somebody who can't think

642
00:27:25.465 --> 00:27:26.864
to tell what's going on,

643
00:27:26.864 --> 00:27:28.705
or to even look for help.

644
00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.205
I couldn't think.

645
00:27:30.205 --> 00:27:31.665
I didn't have any

646
00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:34.324
survival skills of my own.

647
00:27:34.324 --> 00:27:37.465
I'd long since lost that.

648
00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:39.945
I didn't have the will to survive, even,

649
00:27:39.945 --> 00:27:41.405
by that point.

650
00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:43.304
When my daughter was born,

651
00:27:43.304 --> 00:27:45.345
that's stronger than a person's

652
00:27:45.345 --> 00:27:46.885
own survival instincts,

653
00:27:46.885 --> 00:27:48.485
is maternal instincts,

654
00:27:48.485 --> 00:27:51.045
and my maternal instincts to protect my daughter

655
00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:53.525
were so strong, that they used that

656
00:27:53.525 --> 00:27:54.845
to manipulate me,

657
00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:57.185
and that was the most traumatic

658
00:27:57.185 --> 00:27:59.684
form of control that they could ever

659
00:27:59.684 --> 00:28:01.145
have possibly come up with.

660
00:28:01.145 --> 00:28:02.485
<v Voiceover>Was it just constant threats</v>

661
00:28:02.485 --> 00:28:03.647
of what they'd do to her--

662
00:28:03.647 --> 00:28:04.906
<v ->Constant, yes.</v>

663
00:28:04.906 --> 00:28:06.486
<v Voiceover>if you didn't agree to this?</v>

664
00:28:06.486 --> 00:28:09.426
<v ->Yes, it was a constant</v>

665
00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:12.905
leverage, and Kelly's life was always on the line,

666
00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:16.607
so I did everything that I was suppose to do

667
00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:18.326
in order to keep her safe.

668
00:28:18.326 --> 00:28:21.085
If I could have thought on my own,

669
00:28:21.085 --> 00:28:23.785
if I'd had any capacity for conscious thought,

670
00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:26.526
any free thought, I would have known

671
00:28:26.526 --> 00:28:28.526
that that was...

672
00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:30.645
I wasn't actually able to help her

673
00:28:30.645 --> 00:28:33.085
by doing what they wanted me to do.

674
00:28:33.085 --> 00:28:35.666
I never would have done any of

675
00:28:35.666 --> 00:28:38.346
the criminal activities that I was forced to do.

676
00:28:38.346 --> 00:28:40.165
That's totally against my will,

677
00:28:40.165 --> 00:28:42.085
totally against my being

678
00:28:42.085 --> 00:28:43.786
because without free thought,

679
00:28:43.786 --> 00:28:45.925
there's no free will, and without free will

680
00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:47.465
there's no soul expression,

681
00:28:47.465 --> 00:28:49.726
there's no ability to do anything

682
00:28:49.726 --> 00:28:52.886
that you would stand up for and believe in.

683
00:28:52.886 --> 00:28:55.306
I couldn't even protect my daughter,

684
00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:57.166
but I still had my maternal instinct

685
00:28:57.166 --> 00:28:59.786
to do that, so I do believe that that was

686
00:28:59.786 --> 00:29:01.806
a very deliberate thing on their part,

687
00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:04.236
as a further control mechanism,

688
00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:05.956
plus they wanted to raise another

689
00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:08.556
mulit-generational child in the project,

690
00:29:08.556 --> 00:29:11.495
and Kelly, they figured they were gonna raise her,

691
00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:15.536
and espionage was the ultimate plan.

692
00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:18.476
So, Kelly was traumatized

693
00:29:18.476 --> 00:29:22.536
into the project at a very early age.

694
00:29:22.536 --> 00:29:25.835
When Mark rescued Kelly and I in 1988,

695
00:29:28.545 --> 00:29:32.236
Kelly didn't know where she had been, either,

696
00:29:32.236 --> 00:29:33.516
but the kind of--

697
00:29:33.516 --> 00:29:34.796
<v Voiceover>How old was she then?</v>

698
00:29:34.796 --> 00:29:36.056
<v ->Eight years old.</v>

699
00:29:36.056 --> 00:29:37.556
The kind of harmonic,

700
00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:41.016
mind control that she was exposed to,

701
00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:43.696
the high technology that was used today

702
00:29:43.696 --> 00:29:45.235
is what she was exposed to,

703
00:29:45.235 --> 00:29:48.316
and it caused physical damage to her brain stem.

704
00:29:48.316 --> 00:29:50.915
She needs to have a technological

705
00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:55.616
rehab for her.

706
00:29:55.616 --> 00:29:59.256
The methods used for my deprogramming

707
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:02.156
and my healing don't work

708
00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:03.656
the same way with Kelly

709
00:30:03.656 --> 00:30:06.196
because in essence the key that locked the door

710
00:30:06.196 --> 00:30:08.636
to her brain and the locked the door to her mind

711
00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:10.376
needs to be used to unlock it.

712
00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:12.617
The government has the technology.

713
00:30:12.617 --> 00:30:14.746
It can be used for

714
00:30:15.455 --> 00:30:18.406
other good things such as...

715
00:30:18.406 --> 00:30:20.217
It's been proven that it can

716
00:30:20.217 --> 00:30:23.596
reverse autism and be used on autistic children,

717
00:30:23.596 --> 00:30:26.237
and yet, this technology is being suppressed

718
00:30:26.237 --> 00:30:28.517
from society so that they can use it

719
00:30:28.517 --> 00:30:30.937
in an adverse way and control people.

720
00:30:30.937 --> 00:30:33.437
<v Voiceover>There are a lot of people like you</v>

721
00:30:33.437 --> 00:30:35.657
that they've been using?
<v Cathy>Oh, many.</v>

722
00:30:35.657 --> 00:30:37.957
<v Voiceover>This is not an isolated incident?</v>

723
00:30:37.957 --> 00:30:41.577
This is business as usual for them?

724
00:30:41.577 --> 00:30:42.817
<v ->It is, it is,</v>

725
00:30:42.817 --> 00:30:44.317
and they're so wrong because

726
00:30:44.317 --> 00:30:46.407
since Mark

727
00:30:47.736 --> 00:30:49.517
had rescued Kelly and I

728
00:30:49.517 --> 00:30:52.496
and taught me how to remember

729
00:30:52.496 --> 00:30:54.897
those things that were so traumatic

730
00:30:54.897 --> 00:30:58.177
that I had them compartmentalized in my brain.

731
00:30:58.177 --> 00:31:01.237
It was emotionally incomprehensible,

732
00:31:01.237 --> 00:31:03.157
and he taught me that by writing out

733
00:31:03.157 --> 00:31:06.156
my memory, by moving a pen,

734
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:08.797
it would take the emotionally incomprehensible

735
00:31:08.797 --> 00:31:11.756
and shift it over to the logic part of the brain

736
00:31:11.756 --> 00:31:14.557
because it takes the logic part of the brain to move a pen.

737
00:31:14.557 --> 00:31:18.156
By not verbalizing and talking about what happened to me,

738
00:31:18.156 --> 00:31:21.097
and by writing it out,

739
00:31:21.097 --> 00:31:23.596
I was actually able to take down the walls

740
00:31:23.596 --> 00:31:25.757
of those compartments in my brain,

741
00:31:25.757 --> 00:31:29.737
and regain access to my own mind.

742
00:31:29.737 --> 00:31:32.316
<v Voiceover>What happened once this is all down on paper?</v>

743
00:31:32.316 --> 00:31:35.056
When did it end up before the legislature

744
00:31:35.056 --> 00:31:36.697
and these special committees,

745
00:31:36.697 --> 00:31:39.037
and how did that happen and why did that happen?

746
00:31:39.037 --> 00:31:40.727
<v ->As quickly as</v>

747
00:31:41.737 --> 00:31:43.877
it was deprogrammed.

748
00:31:43.877 --> 00:31:46.077
As quickly as it was written out, it was turned over

749
00:31:46.077 --> 00:31:48.617
to US Customs,

750
00:31:48.617 --> 00:31:51.777
and primarily US Customs because it was

751
00:31:51.777 --> 00:31:53.797
a very clean organization

752
00:31:53.797 --> 00:31:55.956
that was doing all it could to stop

753
00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:58.857
the CIAs involvement in the drug industry.

754
00:31:58.857 --> 00:32:01.977
They were working diligently to stop

755
00:32:01.977 --> 00:32:05.497
the criminal activity that was going on.

756
00:32:05.497 --> 00:32:07.937
And this was some very pertinent information.

757
00:32:07.937 --> 00:32:11.556
I had bank account numbers,

758
00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:15.298
and CIA codes, keys and triggers that--

759
00:32:15.298 --> 00:32:16.977
<v Voiceover>Was this from imprinted on your memory?</v>

760
00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:19.897
<v ->Yes, ma'am, all photographically recorded,</v>

761
00:32:19.897 --> 00:32:21.797
so that when I did write it out,

762
00:32:21.797 --> 00:32:24.337
it was photographic, and then validated

763
00:32:24.337 --> 00:32:27.177
by US Customs and other factions of intelligence.

764
00:32:27.177 --> 00:32:28.577
<v Voiceover>So, it was checking out?</v>

765
00:32:28.577 --> 00:32:29.806
Okay, so the information, the numbers,

766
00:32:29.806 --> 00:32:31.027
they were checking out.

767
00:32:31.027 --> 00:32:33.916
<v ->Yes, and it was proving out as quickly</v>

768
00:32:33.916 --> 00:32:36.657
as I was deprogramming it,

769
00:32:36.657 --> 00:32:39.697
and this information was actually

770
00:32:41.527 --> 00:32:43.068
helping...

771
00:32:43.068 --> 00:32:44.527
It should have helped more

772
00:32:44.527 --> 00:32:45.868
if it couldn've gone further,

773
00:32:45.868 --> 00:32:48.868
but the head of US Customs, William Von Raab

774
00:32:48.868 --> 00:32:50.848
just resigned because the government

775
00:32:50.848 --> 00:32:54.667
was covering it up as fast as it was being uncovered,

776
00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:57.068
but nevertheless, many people in the intelligence

777
00:32:57.068 --> 00:32:59.367
communities, many people in law enforcement,

778
00:32:59.367 --> 00:33:02.507
many people in the federal law enforcement agencies

779
00:33:02.507 --> 00:33:05.888
became very disillusioned with the criminal politics

780
00:33:05.888 --> 00:33:08.568
and began doing all they could

781
00:33:08.568 --> 00:33:12.027
from their own positions to make a positive difference,

782
00:33:12.027 --> 00:33:14.398
and dismantling this

783
00:33:15.708 --> 00:33:18.107
horrible mind control

784
00:33:18.107 --> 00:33:20.568
effort that was going on

785
00:33:20.568 --> 00:33:22.447
because our wars were being perpetuated

786
00:33:22.447 --> 00:33:23.887
with it as well.

787
00:33:23.887 --> 00:33:26.687
<v Voiceover>Has any of what you relayed to them</v>

788
00:33:26.687 --> 00:33:28.447
been discredited?

789
00:33:28.447 --> 00:33:30.887
Seriously discredited by anyone?

790
00:33:30.887 --> 00:33:32.208
<v ->Not at all.</v>

791
00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:33.607
It's all been covered up by

792
00:33:33.607 --> 00:33:36.267
the 1947 National Security Act,

793
00:33:36.267 --> 00:33:38.527
by those criminals who are still in control

794
00:33:38.527 --> 00:33:39.787
of the government.

795
00:33:39.787 --> 00:33:41.067
<v Voiceover>The same ones you're talking about?</v>

796
00:33:41.067 --> 00:33:42.288
<v ->The same handful of people.</v>

797
00:33:42.288 --> 00:33:43.868
<v Voiceover>If they're not dead, they're still there.</v>

798
00:33:43.868 --> 00:33:47.148
<v ->As a matter of fact, this same handful, in 1984,</v>

799
00:33:47.148 --> 00:33:50.138
I had cause to be in

800
00:33:52.527 --> 00:33:54.068
Lampe, Missouri,

801
00:33:54.068 --> 00:33:55.728
which is just over the line

802
00:33:55.728 --> 00:33:59.387
from the Arkasas Mena operations,

803
00:33:59.387 --> 00:34:01.427
and Bill Clinton and George Bush,

804
00:34:01.427 --> 00:34:02.868
who are very good friends,

805
00:34:02.868 --> 00:34:05.727
along with Dick Cheney, they're all very good friends

806
00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:08.067
with the same agenda.

807
00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:11.907
George Bush, who I consider to be

808
00:34:11.907 --> 00:34:14.347
the highest, along with Dick Cheney, they are--

809
00:34:14.347 --> 00:34:15.567
<v Voiceover>George Bush, Sr.?</v>

810
00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:17.207
<v ->Yes, George Bush, Sr., definately,</v>

811
00:34:17.207 --> 00:34:20.048
George Bush, Jr. I know for a fact, and witnessed,

812
00:34:20.048 --> 00:34:23.748
is under absolute mind control himself.

813
00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:25.687
<v Voiceover>I have always thought that just watching him.</v>

814
00:34:25.687 --> 00:34:27.388
<v ->He is, he's a good example of what</v>

815
00:34:27.388 --> 00:34:28.787
mind control looks like.

816
00:34:28.787 --> 00:34:31.507
He can deliver a speech verbatim because

817
00:34:31.507 --> 00:34:33.527
it's been programmed in, but to ask--

818
00:34:33.527 --> 00:34:34.908
<v Voiceover>It's the same one, the next 70 times</v>

819
00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:37.507
when the media gets it, it hasn't changed a bit.

820
00:34:37.507 --> 00:34:39.387
The inflection is the same.

821
00:34:39.387 --> 00:34:41.808
<v ->Exactly, the voice inflection's the same</v>

822
00:34:41.808 --> 00:34:43.447
as how it's programmed in,

823
00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:45.008
but ask him a spontaneous question

824
00:34:45.008 --> 00:34:47.148
and he can't answer it,

825
00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:49.987
and that's exactly what mind control looks like.

826
00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:51.927
That's exactly

827
00:34:51.927 --> 00:34:55.387
how I looked under mind control

828
00:34:55.387 --> 00:34:57.407
at that time.

829
00:34:57.407 --> 00:34:59.447
But one place where they were training

830
00:34:59.447 --> 00:35:03.328
the military special forces, in particular,

831
00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:07.387
was at this Swiss Villa Amphitheater in Lampe, Missouri,

832
00:35:07.387 --> 00:35:10.380
where I had cause to be exposed to

833
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.679
George Bush and Bill Clinton

834
00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:15.539
who were involved in a military maneuver

835
00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:17.420
called the Most Dangerous Game,

836
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.747
which is a form of human hunting,

837
00:35:19.747 --> 00:35:21.608
and it's suppose to teach a person

838
00:35:21.608 --> 00:35:24.128
they have no place to run and no place to hide,

839
00:35:24.128 --> 00:35:27.057
well, I since know better than that.

840
00:35:27.057 --> 00:35:28.909
There is a place to run,

841
00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:30.588
and it's right at 'em with the truth.

842
00:35:30.588 --> 00:35:31.988
There's no need to hide.

843
00:35:31.988 --> 00:35:33.628
They're the ones who are hiding

844
00:35:33.628 --> 00:35:35.328
what they're doing

845
00:35:35.328 --> 00:35:37.788
under the 1947 National Security Act

846
00:35:37.788 --> 00:35:40.428
and any other means that they can come up with,

847
00:35:40.428 --> 00:35:43.207
any perversion diversion or anything else

848
00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:45.308
that they might do,

849
00:35:45.308 --> 00:35:47.948
but nevertheless, I heard Bill Clinton

850
00:35:47.948 --> 00:35:49.708
and George Bush talking,

851
00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:51.548
and George Bush told him then

852
00:35:51.548 --> 00:35:54.048
that when the American people became disillusioned

853
00:35:54.048 --> 00:35:56.327
with Republicans leading them into,

854
00:35:56.327 --> 00:35:58.688
what Adolf Hitler termed and George Bush termed,

855
00:35:58.688 --> 00:36:01.768
the New World Order, this mind controlled society,

856
00:36:03.068 --> 00:36:06.828
then Bill Clinton, as a Democrat, would be put into place,

857
00:36:06.828 --> 00:36:10.168
and that was his reward, so to speak,

858
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:12.228
for all of the funding that he was doing

859
00:36:12.228 --> 00:36:14.047
through the cocaine operations.

860
00:36:14.047 --> 00:36:15.608
George Bush ran this country

861
00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:17.628
through the Reagan Administration,

862
00:36:17.628 --> 00:36:20.348
and since I was working, actively working,

863
00:36:20.348 --> 00:36:23.147
during the Reagan Bush Administration,

864
00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:25.128
I was privy to so much of that aspect.

865
00:36:25.128 --> 00:36:27.788
George Bush was very much in control.

866
00:36:27.788 --> 00:36:29.868
George Bush, Sr. was very much in control

867
00:36:29.868 --> 00:36:32.408
of the United States during the Reagan Administration.

868
00:36:32.408 --> 00:36:35.088
Reagan said he was an actor, and that's all he was.

869
00:36:35.088 --> 00:36:37.818
He was just a mouthpiece for

870
00:36:38.668 --> 00:36:41.287
leading the people and misleading the people

871
00:36:42.517 --> 00:36:44.568
in other directions.

872
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:49.328
The plan after that was to put George Bush, Jr. in, who--

873
00:36:49.328 --> 00:36:50.888
<v Voiceover>After Clinton.</v>
<v ->After Clinton,</v>

874
00:36:50.888 --> 00:36:52.368
because he was being groomed

875
00:36:52.368 --> 00:36:54.928
for the presidency, and under total robotic

876
00:36:54.928 --> 00:36:57.988
mind control, and since the plan was to have

877
00:36:57.988 --> 00:37:00.928
people warring with each other on a religious level,

878
00:37:00.928 --> 00:37:03.988
they created this illusion that George Bush

879
00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:08.568
is a religious kind of leader

880
00:37:08.568 --> 00:37:11.388
which I don't think that flew with anybody.

881
00:37:11.388 --> 00:37:13.288
I don't think anybody bought into that because--

882
00:37:13.288 --> 00:37:14.548
<v Voiceover>I don't think they did, either.</v>

883
00:37:14.548 --> 00:37:16.207
<v ->It didn't run deep.</v>

884
00:37:16.207 --> 00:37:17.768
<v Voiceover>And he was treated</v>

885
00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:19.228
similarly to the way you were treated?

886
00:37:19.228 --> 00:37:20.768
<v ->Yes, he was, as as matter of fact,</v>

887
00:37:20.768 --> 00:37:23.388
in Mount Shasta there's

888
00:37:25.147 --> 00:37:28.248
another government military instillation

889
00:37:28.248 --> 00:37:30.508
where a Most Dangerous Game is played,

890
00:37:30.508 --> 00:37:32.449
and was played

891
00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:35.688
in the winter of '86,

892
00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:38.299
and it was there that I...

893
00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:40.058
My daughter was there as well

894
00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:42.458
and was traumatized the same way,

895
00:37:42.458 --> 00:37:45.079
and it was there that

896
00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:49.619
Bush Jr. was exposed to Most Dangerous Game, as well.

897
00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:51.458
<v Voiceover>What do you mean exposed to?</v>

898
00:37:51.458 --> 00:37:52.839
He was one the ones--
<v Cathy>He was hunted.</v>

899
00:37:52.839 --> 00:37:54.379
<v Voiceover>who were hunted?</v>
<v ->He was hunted.</v>

900
00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:55.778
<v Voiceover>By whom?</v>

901
00:37:55.778 --> 00:37:57.799
<v ->At that particular one, was Dick Cheney</v>

902
00:37:57.799 --> 00:38:00.258
and George Bush, Sr.
<v Voiceover>Seriously?</v>

903
00:38:00.258 --> 00:38:03.559
<v ->One thing Dick Cheney always said is,</v>

904
00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:06.379
"If I were to kill" you know, so and so, whatever,

905
00:38:06.379 --> 00:38:08.779
special forces guy it was or whomever

906
00:38:08.779 --> 00:38:11.699
they were disposing of at that time,

907
00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:13.059
"If I were to kill so and so,

908
00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:15.718
"imagine what I would do to the likes of you."

909
00:38:15.718 --> 00:38:18.639
And so I always knew that my life was on the line,

910
00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:21.778
but that really wasn't anything that scared me

911
00:38:21.778 --> 00:38:23.039
or was a motive.

912
00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:25.319
It was when Kelly's life was on the line,

913
00:38:25.319 --> 00:38:28.479
and what he would do to her

914
00:38:28.479 --> 00:38:30.199
that was so terrifying.

915
00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:33.059
But it was so interesting because when

916
00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:35.638
Dick Cheney shot his friend in the face recently,

917
00:38:35.638 --> 00:38:37.139
and it made the news,

918
00:38:37.139 --> 00:38:40.999
before George Bush, Jr., as our acting president,

919
00:38:40.999 --> 00:38:42.899
at this moment,

920
00:38:42.899 --> 00:38:45.118
was briefed on how he was to answer that,

921
00:38:45.118 --> 00:38:47.379
or programmed into how he was to respond to it,

922
00:38:47.379 --> 00:38:49.599
the cameras were on him, and asked him

923
00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.319
the spontaneous question of

924
00:38:53.379 --> 00:38:55.620
about this situation, and he said...

925
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.878
He quoted his own programming verbatim,

926
00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:00.979
and he said, "If he would shoot his own friend

927
00:39:00.979 --> 00:39:02.539
"in the face, imagine what he would

928
00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:04.278
"do to the likes of you."

929
00:39:04.278 --> 00:39:05.698
I mean, what did people think when they

930
00:39:05.698 --> 00:39:07.678
heard that on television?

931
00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:08.878
That's not--

932
00:39:08.878 --> 00:39:10.119
<v Voiceover>Those are the same words.</v>

933
00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:11.799
<v ->There exactly, but I mean, even</v>

934
00:39:11.799 --> 00:39:13.639
if I knew what it meant, I'm sure

935
00:39:13.639 --> 00:39:17.079
there's a lot of people, especially in military operations

936
00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:19.219
that knew exactly what that meant.

937
00:39:19.219 --> 00:39:20.979
But what did the average person think,

938
00:39:20.979 --> 00:39:22.939
that he would even say that to them?

939
00:39:22.939 --> 00:39:26.258
Well, he was kind of whisked off and reprogrammed

940
00:39:26.258 --> 00:39:28.479
at that point, and hew as out of the picture

941
00:39:28.479 --> 00:39:30.579
for some time, while

942
00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:33.278
the media was just scrambling to find a way

943
00:39:33.278 --> 00:39:36.800
to cover that whole thing up,

944
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.038
but that is a prime example of what

945
00:39:40.038 --> 00:39:43.439
mind control looks like and how it acts.

946
00:39:44.259 --> 00:39:46.798
In this same line up and plan that's being

947
00:39:46.798 --> 00:39:48.459
generated out of the same

948
00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:50.679
dark computerization,

949
00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:53.719
the next illusion of change

950
00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:56.559
that we're suppose to have is Hillary Clinton.

951
00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:58.219
Hillary Clinton as a woman

952
00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:00.480
is suppose to go into the office of president.

953
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.139
People have been so traumatized

954
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:07.239
while Bush Jr.'s been in and Dick Cheney

955
00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:09.219
has been

956
00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:14.078
traumatizing the world with

957
00:40:16.059 --> 00:40:18.900
the wars and the horrors that have been going on.

958
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.359
All of a sudden Bill Clinton doesn't look so bad,

959
00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:23.799
and people are thinking maybe Hillary is a solution,

960
00:40:23.799 --> 00:40:25.459
a change, and they forget.

961
00:40:25.459 --> 00:40:27.758
They have a short-term memory.

962
00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.219
When so much of the information

963
00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:32.198
was beginning to come to light,

964
00:40:32.198 --> 00:40:34.879
and the impeachment papers were going

965
00:40:34.879 --> 00:40:36.419
to be filed on Dick Cheney,

966
00:40:36.419 --> 00:40:38.299
this is in very recent times.

967
00:40:38.299 --> 00:40:40.700
Impeachment papers were being filed on him.

968
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.199
The Gonzalez hearings were

969
00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:46.239
just beginning to happen.

970
00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:49.319
Funding for the war was being raised in Congress.

971
00:40:49.319 --> 00:40:52.220
Gun bills were in place to take

972
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.239
weapons away from the people,

973
00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:57.338
so that we can't defend ourselves against what--

974
00:40:57.338 --> 00:40:59.179
<v Voiceover>It was a lot happening at one time.</v>

975
00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:00.699
<v ->It was a whole lot that was happening,</v>

976
00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:02.739
and they needed a diversion.
<v Voiceover>As usual.</v>

977
00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:04.299
<v ->DARPA was used,</v>

978
00:41:04.299 --> 00:41:05.819
an assassin was used.

979
00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:08.019
Right there in Blacksburg, Virginia

980
00:41:08.019 --> 00:41:11.039
the Blacksburg Massacre occurred

981
00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:14.619
with a mind control programmed assassin

982
00:41:14.619 --> 00:41:16.519
out of that.

983
00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:17.738
<v Voiceover>How do you know this person</v>

984
00:41:17.738 --> 00:41:19.539
was a mind controlled assassin?

985
00:41:19.539 --> 00:41:22.059
<v ->Because of all the factors that</v>

986
00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:25.079
are tied in with it, and because of the whole

987
00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:26.939
DARPA thing emanating out of it.

988
00:41:26.939 --> 00:41:29.859
There's absolutely no question in the history,

989
00:41:29.859 --> 00:41:31.919
and the more you understand about mind control,

990
00:41:31.919 --> 00:41:35.719
the more obvious it is what's happening here.

991
00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:38.778
Plus, the person who's the head of the

992
00:41:38.778 --> 00:41:42.319
judiciary committee that was holding these hearings

993
00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:45.078
at that particular time, all the congressional hearings

994
00:41:45.078 --> 00:41:48.718
overseeing all of that, was Senator Leahy.

995
00:41:49.818 --> 00:41:53.538
Senator Leahy is the one who is a funding mechanism

996
00:41:53.538 --> 00:41:56.859
for DARPA, and it's so easy to see

997
00:41:56.859 --> 00:42:00.019
where, if you have few well placed people,

998
00:42:00.019 --> 00:42:03.479
how far reaching this whole thing goes.

999
00:42:05.339 --> 00:42:08.199
These foolish people, for as intelligent as they are,

1000
00:42:08.199 --> 00:42:10.020
they have no wisdom.

1001
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.659
They've never thought about the power of love.

1002
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:16.239
Love is the most powerful force in the universe.

1003
00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:19.239
It's the most powerful healing force in the universe.

1004
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:21.659
They never stop to consider what would happen

1005
00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:24.419
when someone like Mark Philips had hold

1006
00:42:24.419 --> 00:42:26.759
of their information and used it

1007
00:42:26.759 --> 00:42:28.899
for the betterment of humanity,

1008
00:42:28.899 --> 00:42:32.539
to be able to free humanity with the truth.

1009
00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.219
They never could consider that

1010
00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:36.419
because that's not the way their brains work.

1011
00:42:36.419 --> 00:42:38.719
Just like we can't think like they do,

1012
00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:41.059
they can't think like we do,

1013
00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:44.049
and that's where, ultimately, we win.

1014
00:42:44.049 --> 00:42:45.928
That's where they lose.

1015
00:42:45.928 --> 00:42:47.648
<v Voiceover>So, I think so many people,</v>

1016
00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:50.840
as the story has been told around the world,

1017
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.520
wonder how is it that you're still here?

1018
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.563
<v ->Because there are so many good people</v>

1019
00:42:56.563 --> 00:42:58.982
who are absolutely disgusted with this whole process,

1020
00:42:58.982 --> 00:43:02.203
on intelligence levels, on a global basis.

1021
00:43:02.203 --> 00:43:04.733
This is a world-wide

1022
00:43:06.022 --> 00:43:07.943
effort to get the information out.

1023
00:43:07.943 --> 00:43:10.102
As a matter of fact, that MK-ULTRA files

1024
00:43:10.102 --> 00:43:13.802
were declassified very quickly by individuals

1025
00:43:13.802 --> 00:43:16.243
within the intelligence community

1026
00:43:16.243 --> 00:43:18.783
because they want the people to have the information.

1027
00:43:18.783 --> 00:43:20.923
This information is available

1028
00:43:20.923 --> 00:43:23.283
through our website

1029
00:43:23.283 --> 00:43:26.703
ForReasonsOfNationalSecurity.com

1030
00:43:26.703 --> 00:43:29.122
You can get the disk of over 70,000

1031
00:43:29.122 --> 00:43:31.583
CIA declassified documents

1032
00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:33.682
because we obtained them

1033
00:43:33.682 --> 00:43:35.623
while they were declassified.

1034
00:43:35.623 --> 00:43:37.503
When Bush went in, he reclassified them,

1035
00:43:37.503 --> 00:43:39.702
but too late, information's out there.

1036
00:43:39.702 --> 00:43:41.883
You know, once truth is out, it spreads

1037
00:43:41.883 --> 00:43:43.903
because people know truth,

1038
00:43:43.903 --> 00:43:46.263
and even if they don't want to believe it, at first,

1039
00:43:46.263 --> 00:43:48.423
it never goes away,

1040
00:43:48.423 --> 00:43:51.442
and truth ultimately frees 'em from fear.

1041
00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:53.523
It frees 'em from the fear that's been

1042
00:43:53.523 --> 00:43:55.663
controlling all of us for far too long.

1043
00:43:55.663 --> 00:43:59.503
The truth will give them an information base,

1044
00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:02.123
by which to actually formulate

1045
00:44:02.123 --> 00:44:03.802
their thoughts and their actions,

1046
00:44:03.802 --> 00:44:07.363
rather than deliberate misinformation

1047
00:44:07.363 --> 00:44:10.403
and fear mongering that's been going on

1048
00:44:10.403 --> 00:44:14.423
for several generations now, it's time to stop.

1049
00:44:14.423 --> 00:44:17.263
<v Voiceover>And as I've heard you say,</v>

1050
00:44:17.263 --> 00:44:19.443
we're being controlled from every which level,

1051
00:44:19.443 --> 00:44:21.263
right down to Hollywood,

1052
00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:24.303
and so basically as a whistle blower,

1053
00:44:24.303 --> 00:44:27.383
the idea is the reason to name names

1054
00:44:27.383 --> 00:44:30.843
and so forth, is to say, "People wake up.

1055
00:44:30.843 --> 00:44:33.642
"Look, these are the people behind the green curtain."

1056
00:44:33.642 --> 00:44:35.683
<v ->Exactly, because, I mean, going back</v>

1057
00:44:35.683 --> 00:44:39.483
in Ford's cabinet, again, this unelected president

1058
00:44:39.483 --> 00:44:41.383
and all this was during the years of the

1059
00:44:41.383 --> 00:44:44.242
Kennedy assassination, while all of that...

1060
00:44:44.242 --> 00:44:46.303
That was really when things really

1061
00:44:46.303 --> 00:44:48.824
had a major turn in this country.

1062
00:44:48.824 --> 00:44:51.943
His press secretary was Jack Valenti,

1063
00:44:51.943 --> 00:44:54.102
and Jack Valenti is head of the Motion Picture

1064
00:44:54.102 --> 00:44:56.223
Association of America and decides what

1065
00:44:56.223 --> 00:44:59.343
people are going to see through the medias.

1066
00:44:59.343 --> 00:45:01.663
So the medias are very much controlled

1067
00:45:01.663 --> 00:45:04.623
in information, but people have a right

1068
00:45:04.623 --> 00:45:06.443
to this information.

1069
00:45:06.443 --> 00:45:08.683
They have a right to know what's really going on,

1070
00:45:08.683 --> 00:45:11.062
and that it's only a handful of people

1071
00:45:11.062 --> 00:45:13.922
because it's ridiculous for us to allow them

1072
00:45:13.922 --> 00:45:15.743
to stay in power.

1073
00:45:15.743 --> 00:45:17.123
Why are we following--

1074
00:45:17.123 --> 00:45:18.463
<v Voiceover>And we keep voting them in,</v>

1075
00:45:18.463 --> 00:45:19.863
or not voting them in,

1076
00:45:19.863 --> 00:45:21.422
in the case of (indistinct speech)

1077
00:45:21.422 --> 00:45:22.843
I guess that's a silly statement.

1078
00:45:22.843 --> 00:45:24.524
<v ->Exactly, I mean, people--
<v Voiceover>Accepting that.</v>

1079
00:45:24.524 --> 00:45:26.782
<v ->We're following leaders we didn't elect</v>

1080
00:45:26.782 --> 00:45:29.143
because when you look at the electronic voting

1081
00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:31.703
system in the United States,

1082
00:45:31.703 --> 00:45:33.222
and follow the money,

1083
00:45:33.222 --> 00:45:35.163
see who runs Diebold,

1084
00:45:35.163 --> 00:45:37.324
the electronic voting machines.

1085
00:45:37.324 --> 00:45:40.383
You find Dick Cheney and George Bush, again.

1086
00:45:40.383 --> 00:45:42.303
I mean, you're finding these same people

1087
00:45:42.303 --> 00:45:44.102
over and over and over,

1088
00:45:44.102 --> 00:45:45.783
and it's got to stop.

1089
00:45:45.783 --> 00:45:47.162
If people would just wake up

1090
00:45:47.162 --> 00:45:49.243
to the reality that it's within

1091
00:45:49.243 --> 00:45:51.142
each and everyone of us

1092
00:45:51.142 --> 00:45:52.942
to be able to make a positive difference

1093
00:45:52.942 --> 00:45:54.463
in the world.

1094
00:45:54.463 --> 00:45:56.383
I mean, be the change you want to see in the world.

1095
00:45:56.383 --> 00:45:58.423
World peace begins within,

1096
00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:02.243
and when people know this truth,

1097
00:46:02.243 --> 00:46:04.603
when they realize that,

1098
00:46:04.603 --> 00:46:06.762
and believe in truth again,

1099
00:46:06.762 --> 00:46:08.883
when they trust in themselves again,

1100
00:46:08.883 --> 00:46:12.837
when they follow their own strength of spirit,

1101
00:46:12.837 --> 00:46:16.763
rather than fear, fear, fear, fear,

1102
00:46:16.763 --> 00:46:18.783
that truth will free them from fear

1103
00:46:18.783 --> 00:46:20.502
and empower them to be able to make

1104
00:46:20.502 --> 00:46:22.442
a positive difference in their own lives,

1105
00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:24.163
and their own communities,

1106
00:46:24.163 --> 00:46:25.803
and their own nations,

1107
00:46:25.803 --> 00:46:27.982
and ultimately the world as a whole.

1108
00:46:27.982 --> 00:46:29.962
That's where

1109
00:46:29.962 --> 00:46:31.862
our hope lies.

1110
00:46:31.862 --> 00:46:34.263
That is where the solution is

1111
00:46:34.263 --> 00:46:36.304
because

1112
00:46:36.304 --> 00:46:38.282
the truth that made me free

1113
00:46:38.282 --> 00:46:40.203
can make others free

1114
00:46:40.203 --> 00:46:43.822
and those fools have never stopped once

1115
00:46:43.822 --> 00:46:46.142
to consider the strength of the human spirit,

1116
00:46:46.142 --> 00:46:47.862
if they had, I wouldn't be here talking,

1117
00:46:47.862 --> 00:46:49.624
and being able to tell what happened.

1118
00:46:51.034 --> 00:46:52.823
<v Voiceover>Truer words were never spoken.</v>

1119
00:46:52.823 --> 00:46:54.543
The fact that you have been able to come

1120
00:46:54.543 --> 00:46:57.783
to this place of peace and empowerment

1121
00:46:57.783 --> 00:47:00.123
and strength to tell your story,

1122
00:47:00.123 --> 00:47:02.463
to help encourage others to stop listening

1123
00:47:02.463 --> 00:47:04.633
to the lies is

1124
00:47:05.282 --> 00:47:07.002
evidence enough for all of us

1125
00:47:07.002 --> 00:47:08.583
to get off our butts, wouldn't you say?

1126
00:47:08.583 --> 00:47:10.563
<v ->I would certainly hope so,</v>

1127
00:47:10.563 --> 00:47:14.004
and I'm seeing such a huge movement of it, now,

1128
00:47:14.004 --> 00:47:16.243
that it's just a matter of time,

1129
00:47:16.243 --> 00:47:17.902
and like Mark said,

1130
00:47:19.252 --> 00:47:20.863
the good guys have already won.

1131
00:47:20.863 --> 00:47:23.243
The bad guys just don't know it, yet.

1132
00:47:23.243 --> 00:47:24.903
<v ->We chose to do this interview</v>

1133
00:47:24.903 --> 00:47:27.062
because we feel that this reign of terror

1134
00:47:27.062 --> 00:47:28.422
is coming to an end,

1135
00:47:28.422 --> 00:47:29.963
and needs all of our consciousness

1136
00:47:29.963 --> 00:47:32.003
and action to lay it to rest.

1137
00:47:32.003 --> 00:47:33.642
The truth is our best tool

1138
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.343
to begin the process.

1139
00:47:35.343 --> 00:47:37.463
To understand the full extent of Cathy's experience,

1140
00:47:37.463 --> 00:47:39.622
you can purchase a copy of her books

1141
00:47:39.622 --> 00:47:41.243

1142
00:47:41.243 --> 00:47:43.664
Be warned that this is emotionally challenging material.

1143
00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:45.763
Until next time, thanks for watching
