00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:03.237
(hypnotic music)

2
00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:14.165
<v ->Many people still view meditation</v>

3
00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:16.334
as a spiritual practice that's optional

4
00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:18.403
while at the same time turning to psychics

5
00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:22.307
as intermediaries to receive reflections of our own truths.

6
00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:24.209
This doesn't make sense anymore.

7
00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:26.678
If there were ever a time to access our own truth

8
00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:29.281
to navigate through life, the time would be now,

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.950
and we can't do it without a clear and connected mind.

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.720
Sarah McLean has been teaching meditation for decades

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.288
and has some poignant thoughts

12
00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:39.974
as to its value in our lives.

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:42.743 line:15% 
(hypnotic music)

14
00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:49.467
Sarah, I wanna start this with a little tiny story,

15
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.702
just to kind of set it up because it happened

16
00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:53.071
in the last 24 hours.

17
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:55.840
So here we are in Sedona, my heart's home,

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.876
your home as well, and I thought, "While in Rome,"

19
00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:02.014
and I was pondering something and I was at a friend's house

20
00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:04.116
who had a number of sets of little cards, you know,

21
00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:06.484
the divination cards, angel cards and such.

22
00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:07.886
I thought, "Sure, why not?"

23
00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:09.420
picked a deck, rolled it out,

24
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.790
and I was asking about something very deep and profound,

25
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.460
and it said, "Listen," right?

26
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.193
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

27
00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:16.728
<v Regina>And about going inside</v>

28
00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:20.681
and getting the deeper messages, to be quiet.

29
00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:23.235
My host, the friend, said,

30
00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:25.577
"I chose those exact two cards earlier this morning."

31
00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:26.404
<v ->Oh. (laughs)</v>

32
00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:28.807
In two different decks, she chose "Listen."

33
00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:31.643
I told my other friend, the one I'm staying with,

34
00:01:31.643 --> 00:01:33.043
and she said, "That's so funny,

35
00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:34.213
"I just had the same conversation

36
00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:35.814
"with my son this morning."

37
00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:39.685
So en masse, there's this imperative

38
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:40.986
that we begin listening,

39
00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:43.288
and I'm sure for very practical reasons

40
00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.890
as well as deep spiritual reasons.

41
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.758
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

42
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Regina>And that's what so lovely about what you do,</v>

43
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.630
is because your passion, your mission in life

44
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.634
is to help anybody start listening

45
00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:58.903
to their own true voice via meditation,

46
00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:00.162
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>And you're just</v>

47
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.338
superb at what you do.

48
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:04.075
You get through to the rich and the famous

49
00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:08.179
as well as people in the judicial system,

50
00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.281
justices, so forth, everybody.

51
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:11.249
<v ->Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</v>

52
00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.551
<v Regina>So let's talk about how that happened to you,</v>

53
00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:14.653
because you're a wild adventurer.

54
00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:15.721
You've been in the Army,

55
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.223
you've traveled around the world on a bicycle.

56
00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:19.524
(both laugh)

57
00:02:19.524 --> 00:02:22.594
I mean you've lived in countries all over.

58
00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:23.395
You've done it all.

59
00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:24.502
You've lived in ashrams.

60
00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:25.597
<v ->Mm-hmm.
<v Regina>So tell us about</v>

61
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:27.665
how this began for you.

62
00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:29.967
<v ->I think it had to do with listening really.</v>

63
00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.137
I really do because I was about 26 years old,

64
00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:36.408
and I had what most people are searching for,

65
00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:38.010
a really beautiful home,

66
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.445
I had a great job, I was making great money,

67
00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:42.447
and I had a wonderful partner,

68
00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.016
and I was healthy and happy.

69
00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:47.719
And one day, I looked around and I thought,

70
00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.454
"Is that all there is?"

71
00:02:49.454 --> 00:02:52.790
And I was attracted to reading a book review,

72
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.895
and I remember reading about this approach to healing

73
00:02:56.895 --> 00:03:00.132
by an Indian man who was writing a book about it,

74
00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.635
and I was reading about how he used herbs and diet

75
00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:06.804
and daily routine and meditation and massage,

76
00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:09.141
and I thought, "Oh, that sounds interesting."

77
00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:10.342
In the Army, I was a medic,

78
00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:14.279
and we really treated the body more like a machine.

79
00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:18.416
But here was this man who was sort of bringing to light

80
00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:22.153
how all of these approaches through the senses

81
00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:23.888
could bring about balance.

82
00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:25.724
And I went and picked up that book,

83
00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:28.793
and it was called Perfect Health by Deepak Chopra,

84
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.195
who, at the time, was not a household name.

85
00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:34.232
And so I immediately read that book and said

86
00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:36.735
I want everything in this book.

87
00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:39.037
I wanna know how to practice

88
00:03:39.037 --> 00:03:41.339
everything this man is talking about.

89
00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.743
And it became about the science of Ayurveda.

90
00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:47.913
Ayur means life, and veda means knowledge,

91
00:03:47.913 --> 00:03:50.482
so it's the knowledge of life and longevity.

92
00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:53.151
And so I immediately picked up the phone

93
00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:56.026
and called and said, "Can I work for you?"

94
00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:58.390
And they said, "Sure, come on down.

95
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.592
"You can volunteer and answer the phones."

96
00:04:00.592 --> 00:04:02.927
And actually, it was in Massachusetts where I had grown up,

97
00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:04.730
so I was pretty fearless on that.

98
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.833
I left my entire life and I went to Massachusetts

99
00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:12.871
and worked as a volunteer, living in an environment

100
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.507
with a whole bunch of other people who meditated

101
00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:17.575
and practiced Ayurveda.

102
00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.044
And I got very involved in meditation

103
00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:22.681
because that was the primary approach

104
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.383
for reducing stress in the nervous system

105
00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:29.454
and for pretty much getting in touch with who we are

106
00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:32.423
outside of illness or disease

107
00:04:32.423 --> 00:04:35.260
or outside of who we think we are,

108
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.961
outside of the roles we play

109
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:38.997
and the responsibilities we have.

110
00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:40.264
So it was really a...

111
00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:42.133
It was the primary approach to healing,

112
00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:43.501
and I didn't realize it at the time

113
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:45.137
I was reading that book review,

114
00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.172
but the word Ayurveda,

115
00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:49.040
I remember talking with someone

116
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.942
right after I had read this book review,

117
00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:53.245
and I said, "That's what I'm going to be doing."

118
00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:55.747
It was like a listening, like, "That's it."

119
00:04:55.747 --> 00:04:57.982
And so you talk about listening,

120
00:04:57.982 --> 00:05:01.286
and it brings up what I've heard

121
00:05:01.286 --> 00:05:03.154
a lot of people talk about here in Sedona.

122
00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:06.091
They say, "Prayer is talking to God,

123
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:08.727
"and meditation is listening to God."

124
00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:10.295
<v Regina>That's a very good way to say it.</v>

125
00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:13.665
<v ->It is, but I've really thought about it like a koan,</v>

126
00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:16.301
and I thought prayer is talking to God

127
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.736
and sometimes listening.

128
00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:19.071
<v Regina>Or asking a lot of,</v>

129
00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.939
asking for a lot of favors.

130
00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.973
<v ->Yeah (laughs), right.
(Regina laughs)

131
00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:24.209
"Please, please, please!"

132
00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:25.644
<v Regina>"Please, I'll do this if you'll do that."</v>

133
00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:26.911
<v ->Right (laughs).</v>

134
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:30.048
But then when I really looked at it more deeply,

135
00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:33.552
is I realized that meditation helps us,

136
00:05:33.552 --> 00:05:35.019
it's like the big Q-tip,

137
00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:37.889
helps us to almost purify our senses

138
00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.859
so we can more clearly listen

139
00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:43.978
and pay attention to the whispers.

140
00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:47.499
<v Regina>Absolutely, and this is a really key point.</v>

141
00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:52.470
Right now, we're living in an age of disinformation,

142
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.941
saturation of information until our minds and our bodies

143
00:05:56.941 --> 00:05:59.210
are on complete overload.

144
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.779
And not only that, it's becoming...

145
00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.114
There are so many voices saying so many things,

146
00:06:03.114 --> 00:06:05.684
with the explosion in access through YouTube,

147
00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:07.719
the Internet, and so forth

148
00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.988
that we hear from a lot of our viewers,

149
00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:13.959
"I am so overloaded, I don't know where to even begin now."

150
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.926
<v ->Right.</v>

151
00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:19.926
<v Regina>And the only place we really have to go</v>

152
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:24.469
is inside to hear our own refined voice,

153
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.038
the highest essence of ourselves.

154
00:06:27.038 --> 00:06:30.474
And you can't do that without being still.

155
00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:33.944
You can't do that without some form of meditative practice,

156
00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:36.881
and I would guess every person listening to this right now

157
00:06:36.881 --> 00:06:40.388
would love to have full access to themselves

158
00:06:40.388 --> 00:06:42.820
to find out what is it, for them and their lives,

159
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.323
absolutely their truth.

160
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:46.224
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>And it might not be</v>

161
00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:48.493
someone else's truth but their truth.

162
00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:50.495
Only you can give your truth, right?

163
00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:51.996
<v ->Right, and I love...</v>

164
00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:54.700
That is one of the biggest benefits of meditation.

165
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.101
Sure, it's been researched so much now

166
00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:58.936
and all the clinics are recommending it,

167
00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:02.841
Mayo Clinic and Harvard Center for Mind-Body Healing,

168
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:05.844
but more than lowering blood pressure

169
00:07:05.844 --> 00:07:08.480
and enhancing the immune system

170
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.617
and relieving the stress in the cardiovascular system,

171
00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:14.619
the side effect or the side benefit

172
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:16.921
that I most love about meditation

173
00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:20.558
is that it slowly and subtly

174
00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.762
moves the reference point in our lives

175
00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:26.597
from the world out there of noise and phenomenon

176
00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:30.635
and information and what other people's opinions are of us,

177
00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:34.638
subtly, we start to become our own authority.

178
00:07:34.638 --> 00:07:38.810
We start to become, as Deepak Chopra would say,

179
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.446
we start to become "self-referred,"

180
00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:45.218
referring really as our inner wisdom

181
00:07:45.218 --> 00:07:47.085
becomes our reference point.

182
00:07:47.085 --> 00:07:49.187
So no matter what's happening out there,

183
00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:52.690
whether it be bad weather or even a natural disaster

184
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.690
or losing a job or getting into an argument with a partner,

185
00:07:57.863 --> 00:08:02.400
it's almost like that's happening, yes, that's the scenery,

186
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.104
but the one who is experiencing it is so rooted

187
00:08:06.104 --> 00:08:10.241
in balance and presence that it doesn't ever

188
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:13.344
get overshadowed by the world out there.

189
00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:16.314
And I think that is what the real issues are.

190
00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:19.317
And I say surround yourself in silence.

191
00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:21.887
Really take a look at

192
00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:24.223
what you are putting in your environment,

193
00:08:24.223 --> 00:08:27.225
the noises that you...

194
00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:29.327
are out there and that are coming in.

195
00:08:29.327 --> 00:08:32.029
Do you walk into your apartment and flip on the television

196
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:34.266
or automatically turn on the radio

197
00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:36.868
or automatically get on the phone

198
00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:39.338
just to fill up that silence?

199
00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:40.371
It's almost like we need to give

200
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.173
our nervous systems a break.

201
00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:43.007
<v Regina>Hugely.</v>

202
00:08:43.007 --> 00:08:43.741
<v ->Yeah.</v>

203
00:08:43.741 --> 00:08:45.210
<v Regina>And let's talk about some of...</v>

204
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.448
Because you see the entire swath of society, everyone,

205
00:08:49.448 --> 00:08:53.486
what are you seeing by way of this incredible interference

206
00:08:53.486 --> 00:08:56.121
with the nervous system, the mind, and so forth?

207
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:58.923
Can you give us just a couple of anecdotal situations

208
00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:02.427
of people who have sought you out or found their way to you

209
00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:06.564
who are literally shattered with so much incoming

210
00:09:06.564 --> 00:09:09.568
they couldn't handle it any more?

211
00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:12.037
<v ->Well, I have people coming to learn to meditate</v>

212
00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:15.873
from all walks of life, whether it be they've just,

213
00:09:15.873 --> 00:09:17.108
their partner just died

214
00:09:17.108 --> 00:09:19.412
or they found out they're at stage four in cancer

215
00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:21.212
or they've lost their job

216
00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:23.548
or they've retired and they don't know who they are

217
00:09:23.548 --> 00:09:25.484
without their reference point of the work.

218
00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Regina>Without the business card.</v>

219
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.585
<v ->Right.</v>

220
00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:30.622
So I work with many people on that level,

221
00:09:30.622 --> 00:09:33.625
and it's almost like their dark night of the soul.

222
00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:37.329
And I had mine, and it was a couple of days, I mean,

223
00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:41.600
and this is the fallacy that there is only one in your life

224
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.069
(laughs) because there can be a few.

225
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:47.005
But I often am with people while they're

226
00:09:47.005 --> 00:09:48.240
in the middle of that

227
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.240
or in the middle of their wake-up call.

228
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.909
And of course, it'd be great to avoid that

229
00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:54.313
and wake up before the wake-up call.

230
00:09:54.313 --> 00:09:57.949
But I find that people have...

231
00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:00.285
I think that stress is building up in the nervous system,

232
00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:03.221
whether it be from external too much noise

233
00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.125
or toxicity in the environment or the food

234
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.826
or toxic relationships, whether it to be a job

235
00:10:08.826 --> 00:10:13.665
or to a spouse or to friends or to family members.

236
00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:17.936
I find that this layer of stress keeps us

237
00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:21.406
from really acknowledging our inner wisdom.

238
00:10:21.406 --> 00:10:23.475
So for instance, a woman came to me,

239
00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:25.577
and she was with her husband who had had a stroke.

240
00:10:25.577 --> 00:10:27.579
They were visiting from Detroit.

241
00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:29.514
They lived in a very,

242
00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:31.315
not a great neighborhood.

243
00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:34.986
She had just retired from being a school teacher.

244
00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:36.788
She was there for years.

245
00:10:36.788 --> 00:10:40.059
And often, when people come to meditate with me,

246
00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.660
I ask them, "Well, what do you want?

247
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.161
"What do you really want?"

248
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:46.932
Most people haven't even asked themselves that question.

249
00:10:46.932 --> 00:10:49.467
And I said, "Well, if you dare to dream,

250
00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:50.068
"what would you want?"

251
00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:52.304
She goes, "I I want to live in Sedona."

252
00:10:52.304 --> 00:10:55.974
And I said, "Well, why wouldn't you be able to do that?"

253
00:10:55.974 --> 00:10:57.442
She said, "Well, I can't sell my house.

254
00:10:57.442 --> 00:10:58.610
"It's not worth anything.

255
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.812
"We owe more than what its value is,

256
00:11:00.812 --> 00:11:02.615
"and I can't leave Detroit."

257
00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:05.850
And over maybe three to six months

258
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.785
after she learned to meditate,

259
00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:11.456
she could see where her mind was actually the obstacle

260
00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:14.025
to possibilities occurring.

261
00:11:14.025 --> 00:11:16.294
So I just have to report, a year or two later,

262
00:11:16.294 --> 00:11:17.929
she's living here in Sedona

263
00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:20.598
happily with her husband,

264
00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:23.168
not even a second thought about did she do the right thing.

265
00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:24.135
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

266
00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:25.169
<v ->So it can happen.</v>

267
00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:26.338
It can happen where--

268
00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:28.006
<v Regina>It worked itself out.</v>

269
00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:30.075
The creative energy can flow

270
00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:34.112
if you have yourself unblocked enough to be clear...

271
00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:35.479
I don't wanna to use the word channel,

272
00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:38.483
but conduit for information for your own essence.

273
00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:40.285
<v ->Yes, and what is our own essence?</v>

274
00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:42.687
Our own essence, we call it,

275
00:11:42.687 --> 00:11:43.888
when we are meditating,

276
00:11:43.888 --> 00:11:46.224
we turn our attention inward.

277
00:11:46.224 --> 00:11:49.160
We escape the world of form and phenomenon

278
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.163
and turn our attention inward,

279
00:11:51.163 --> 00:11:53.130
and we're not looking for a particular experience

280
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.599
while we meditate.

281
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:56.367
We are literally just doing it

282
00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:58.437
to purify the nervous system.

283
00:11:58.437 --> 00:12:01.706
And when we do it, we go to subtler and subtler levels

284
00:12:01.706 --> 00:12:04.375
of the thinking process until we bump into

285
00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:07.245
the one who is having the thought, the presence.

286
00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:08.914
And the qualities of our presence,

287
00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:11.716
each one of us has these qualities

288
00:12:11.716 --> 00:12:16.521
of creativity and silence and perfection

289
00:12:16.521 --> 00:12:20.592
and bliss and infinite organizing power.

290
00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:22.827
<v Regina>And right action for the moment.</v>

291
00:12:22.827 --> 00:12:26.799
<v ->Spontaneous right action is one of the major access.</v>

292
00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:28.934
That's what we can access when we start

293
00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:31.736
having meditation be part of our lives.

294
00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:35.107
So that when we are not exactly sure

295
00:12:35.107 --> 00:12:37.575
of which way to take, go left or right

296
00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:40.079
at a certain fork in the road,

297
00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:41.779
when we meditate, we have access

298
00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:43.682
to the spontaneous right action,

299
00:12:43.682 --> 00:12:45.851
and we don't have to question it.

300
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:47.118
We don't have to overthink it.

301
00:12:47.118 --> 00:12:49.221
We don't have to sleep on it.

302
00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:52.657
We literally know because it's,

303
00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:55.626
it's almost like it's our yoga.

304
00:12:55.626 --> 00:12:57.996
And meditation comes from the yoga tradition,

305
00:12:57.996 --> 00:13:01.332
and yoga means the union of mind and body

306
00:13:01.332 --> 00:13:03.502
and spirit and environment,

307
00:13:03.502 --> 00:13:07.305
and it means that when we think something,

308
00:13:07.305 --> 00:13:09.808
when we feel it and think it and say it and do it

309
00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:12.277
and they're all in alignment, that's yoga.

310
00:13:12.277 --> 00:13:16.314
And spontaneous right action is from that yoga.

311
00:13:16.314 --> 00:13:18.349
<v Regina>And the thing about that</v>

312
00:13:18.349 --> 00:13:19.984
that I find so beautiful is

313
00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:22.487
once the mind has been disciplined

314
00:13:22.487 --> 00:13:25.123
to be able to go into the more quiet state

315
00:13:25.123 --> 00:13:28.460
to allow this nervous system response and so forth,

316
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.896
then you don't have to be in a state of meditation

317
00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:34.032
to have this knowing anymore.

318
00:13:34.032 --> 00:13:36.368
There is just a sense of knowing.

319
00:13:36.368 --> 00:13:37.303
<v ->Exactly.</v>

320
00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:38.837
It's actually, that's again the yoga.

321
00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:42.706
It's literally creating

322
00:13:42.706 --> 00:13:44.977
an immersion into these qualities

323
00:13:44.977 --> 00:13:47.879
and then bringing it out into our waking state.

324
00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:49.547
That's actually...

325
00:13:49.547 --> 00:13:52.217
We use the analogy oftentimes when you look at a rug

326
00:13:52.217 --> 00:13:55.120
and when people are dyeing the yarn for the rug,

327
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.590
they put the yarn into this big vat of dye,

328
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.924
and especially in the Middle East,

329
00:13:58.924 --> 00:13:59.825
where I watched them do it,

330
00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:02.794
they take the dye, the yarn that's been dyed,

331
00:14:02.794 --> 00:14:04.162
and they lay it out on the ground,

332
00:14:04.162 --> 00:14:06.531
and the sun fades the qualities of the dye out,

333
00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:09.034
and they go over and over and keep on doing that.

334
00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:11.769
And what happens is eventually,

335
00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:13.738
the qualities of the dye

336
00:14:13.738 --> 00:14:16.208
are completely infused into this yarn,

337
00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:17.675
and that's the same thing that happens

338
00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:20.079
when we meditate regularly,

339
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:23.181
is the quality or the qualities of our soul

340
00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:26.851
are now infused in our day-to-day life.

341
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:28.587
And you did say the word practice.

342
00:14:28.587 --> 00:14:31.189
It's literally a training of the awareness

343
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:33.091
to turn the attention inward.

344
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:35.760
Because if you noticed the way the body is designed,

345
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.330
it's designed to sort of decode the world out there

346
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.065
We are either going to smell it, taste it,

347
00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:43.034
touch it, see it, or hear it.

348
00:14:43.034 --> 00:14:47.104
And so all of our senses are focusing us out there

349
00:14:47.104 --> 00:14:49.707
and rarely, especially in the Western world,

350
00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:52.244
do we say, "Okay, let's close our eyes

351
00:14:52.244 --> 00:14:54.146
"and turn our attention inward,"

352
00:14:54.146 --> 00:14:58.016
unless it's in the form of prayer or if we're kissing.

353
00:14:58.016 --> 00:15:00.318
Or if we're not wanting to watch a movie

354
00:15:00.318 --> 00:15:02.887
or some sort of scary scene, we'll close our eyes.

355
00:15:02.887 --> 00:15:06.658
But rarely do we close our eyes when we're awake.

356
00:15:06.658 --> 00:15:10.095
And so this is a hurdle a lot of people have to get over.

357
00:15:10.095 --> 00:15:12.130
<v Regina>It is. It takes time.</v>

358
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.598
You've been doing this many, many years,

359
00:15:13.598 --> 00:15:14.699
it's so second nature.

360
00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:15.967
I've been doing it many years.

361
00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:18.538
I can't think if I can't take time to close my eyes.

362
00:15:18.538 --> 00:15:19.737
I can't.

363
00:15:19.737 --> 00:15:20.773
(Sarah laughs) I have a hard time

364
00:15:20.773 --> 00:15:22.207
sensing my way through things

365
00:15:22.207 --> 00:15:24.142
if I'm overwhelmed by the physical world.

366
00:15:24.142 --> 00:15:24.709
<v ->Exactly.</v>

367
00:15:24.709 --> 00:15:27.245
<v Regina>And I find that it's my salvation,</v>

368
00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:29.347
is to be able to do what you say,

369
00:15:29.347 --> 00:15:31.183
to just close my eyes, go inside,

370
00:15:31.183 --> 00:15:34.118
and take a breath, and there's your answer,

371
00:15:34.118 --> 00:15:35.720
whatever it is you need.

372
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.988
But it didn't happen overnight.

373
00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:37.822
<v ->Right
<v Regina>Let's talk about</v>

374
00:15:37.822 --> 00:15:39.324
what happens with people that come

375
00:15:39.324 --> 00:15:40.459
for the first time and say,

376
00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:42.540
"Oh, I have ants in my pants.

377
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.763
"I just can't seem to quiet my mind.

378
00:15:44.763 --> 00:15:46.864
"I can't seem to keep still."

379
00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:49.135
Now give us an idea of how you would work

380
00:15:49.135 --> 00:15:50.569
with someone from the beginning.

381
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:52.203
<v ->Okay, I do have a lot of what they call</v>

382
00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:54.440
type A personalities come in.
<v Regina>I bet.</v>

383
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.040
<v ->And they say, "I've tried to meditate.</v>

384
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.810
"I've gotten the books, I've gotten the CDs,

385
00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.677
"and I can't do it.

386
00:15:58.677 --> 00:15:59.678
"My mind won't...

387
00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:01.513
"I can't quiet my mind."

388
00:16:01.513 --> 00:16:03.782
And I'll say you don't have to be the one

389
00:16:03.782 --> 00:16:04.883
to quiet the mind.

390
00:16:04.883 --> 00:16:07.886
It's not a requirement to do that.

391
00:16:07.886 --> 00:16:10.422
Meditation is made up of two things.

392
00:16:10.422 --> 00:16:12.624
It's made up of your attention

393
00:16:12.624 --> 00:16:15.026
and a focus of your attention.

394
00:16:15.026 --> 00:16:18.329
So for those of you listening at home, I'd say

395
00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:21.032
right now, turn your attention

396
00:16:21.032 --> 00:16:25.904
to the one who is listening to this broadcast.

397
00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:28.339
Turn your attention to the one who is listening

398
00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:31.676
or watching, and there is a presence there,

399
00:16:31.676 --> 00:16:35.247
and this presence is the real you.

400
00:16:35.247 --> 00:16:37.082
It's not necessarily what you're wearing

401
00:16:37.082 --> 00:16:39.050
or your age or your height or your weight

402
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.286
or your job or your family relations.

403
00:16:41.286 --> 00:16:42.354
It's none of that.

404
00:16:42.354 --> 00:16:43.522
There is a presence there that's been

405
00:16:43.522 --> 00:16:46.991
with each one of us since we can remember.

406
00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:50.261
And this presence, some of the qualities

407
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:54.232
are silence and balance and perfection

408
00:16:54.232 --> 00:16:57.802
and bliss and happiness and wholeness.

409
00:16:57.802 --> 00:17:00.506
And so when we turn our attention inward,

410
00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:02.673
we start to access that.

411
00:17:02.673 --> 00:17:05.844
But so when people say, "I can't quiet the mind,"

412
00:17:05.844 --> 00:17:09.448
I say, "Okay, let's use your awareness

413
00:17:09.448 --> 00:17:10.849
"and focus on something."

414
00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.218
Now some people focus on their breath.

415
00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:17.622
That's using the inner subtle experience of sound,

416
00:17:17.622 --> 00:17:19.691
if you listen to your breath,

417
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:22.528
or the subtle experience of touch or feel

418
00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:24.562
because you can feel the breath.

419
00:17:24.562 --> 00:17:26.698
You're not touching something out there.

420
00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:29.100
You're not listening to something out there,

421
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.571
but you're literally sort of listening in your mind's ear

422
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:35.840
and feeling in your inside.

423
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.642
It's like if you brought your attention right now

424
00:17:37.642 --> 00:17:41.780
to your left foot, it's been there all along,

425
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.449
but that's the subtle change of awareness.

426
00:17:44.449 --> 00:17:47.986
So we're using a very easy subtle change of awareness,

427
00:17:47.986 --> 00:17:49.220
and we'll use a focus.

428
00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.722
Now some people use a breath.

429
00:17:50.722 --> 00:17:53.224
Some people use a mantra.

430
00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:55.493
Mantras are from every tradition.

431
00:17:55.493 --> 00:17:58.913
I like to use a basic mantra.

432
00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:01.633
We've all heard the word "om."

433
00:18:01.633 --> 00:18:02.867
Om now has a meaning.

434
00:18:02.867 --> 00:18:05.870
They say it's the sound of the universe expanding,

435
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.772
so that could be a mantra.

436
00:18:07.772 --> 00:18:11.275
Sometimes I use the mantra

437
00:18:11.275 --> 00:18:15.347
where I think the sound "so"

438
00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:19.784
on the inhale, and I think the sound "hum" on the exhale.

439
00:18:19.784 --> 00:18:22.821
And this mantra doesn't mean anything, but it's literally

440
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:25.556
the linguistic representation of the breath.

441
00:18:25.556 --> 00:18:26.357
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

442
00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:29.127
<v ->So we can think that, and every time we go,</v>

443
00:18:29.127 --> 00:18:30.329
"Oh gosh, now I have to think about

444
00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:31.529
"what I'm gonna have for lunch

445
00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:33.564
"or what I'm going to do tomorrow at work

446
00:18:33.564 --> 00:18:36.669
"or what I'm going to wear at this meeting I'm having,"

447
00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:38.770
every time the attention drifts away

448
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.672
from the focus in meditation,

449
00:18:40.672 --> 00:18:43.775
we just simply and easily bring our attention back to it

450
00:18:43.775 --> 00:18:45.610
without getting angry at ourselves,

451
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.913
without thinking we're doing it wrong.

452
00:18:47.913 --> 00:18:50.950
So we don't actually stop ourselves from thinking,

453
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.251
but the practice of meditation

454
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:55.586
slows down the thinking process

455
00:18:55.586 --> 00:18:58.490
and we go to subtler and subtler levels of that

456
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.092
until we bump into our presence.

457
00:19:01.092 --> 00:19:02.126
<v Regina>And you're right, that part</v>

458
00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:04.262
that people go through, that beating themselves up

459
00:19:04.262 --> 00:19:05.764
because their mind is straying

460
00:19:05.764 --> 00:19:07.698
rather than like a little child

461
00:19:07.698 --> 00:19:10.234
gently nudging the thought back, you know.

462
00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:11.436
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>This is big</v>

463
00:19:11.436 --> 00:19:12.970
because we even put judgment on ourselves

464
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.606
in the very thing we're doing

465
00:19:14.606 --> 00:19:16.975
to connect with ourselves (laughs).

466
00:19:16.975 --> 00:19:17.909
<v ->Yeah.</v>

467
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:19.477
And thoughts are a part of meditation.

468
00:19:19.477 --> 00:19:22.780
There is no way to stop thinking by thinking about it.

469
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.514
<v Regina>Right.</v>

470
00:19:23.514 --> 00:19:24.349
<v ->It's impossible.</v>

471
00:19:24.349 --> 00:19:26.550
The nature of the mind is to think,

472
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.554
just like the nature of the eye is to see.

473
00:19:29.554 --> 00:19:31.857
So that's just what's going on here.

474
00:19:31.857 --> 00:19:33.658
It's just the nature of the mind.

475
00:19:33.658 --> 00:19:37.863
So when we can interrupt the constant flow of thoughts

476
00:19:37.863 --> 00:19:41.599
with a mantra that has no particular meaning,

477
00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:44.135
it interrupts the thoughts where one,

478
00:19:44.135 --> 00:19:45.269
the meaning of one thought leads

479
00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:46.571
to the meaning of another.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

480
00:19:46.571 --> 00:19:48.240
Because there is no visual association.

481
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.640
<v ->Right, or mental association.</v>

482
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.575
<v Regina>Or mental association, right.</v>

483
00:19:50.575 --> 00:19:52.177
<v ->So it immediately just almost hiccups</v>

484
00:19:52.177 --> 00:19:54.012
or stops the mind for an instant,

485
00:19:54.012 --> 00:19:55.947
and then the mind will pick up with

486
00:19:55.947 --> 00:19:57.648
"What's for dinner?" or "What time is it?"

487
00:19:57.648 --> 00:19:58.984
or "Is this working?"

488
00:19:58.984 --> 00:20:02.921
So I say meditation is a lot like brushing my teeth.

489
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:04.956
I do it every single day.

490
00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:07.392
I'm not looking for a fabulous experience

491
00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:09.027
when I'm brushing my teeth.

492
00:20:09.027 --> 00:20:11.829
I know it's immediately going to make me feel better,

493
00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:14.733
and I know that the long-term effects are great.

494
00:20:14.733 --> 00:20:18.469
So I'm in Sedona here and I'm a meditation teacher,

495
00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:20.739
which I think is pretty cliche.

496
00:20:20.739 --> 00:20:22.260
(both laugh)

497
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.311
And the emphasis oftentimes here in Sedona is,

498
00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:29.882
"What are your experiences in meditation?

499
00:20:29.882 --> 00:20:31.950
"Did you meet your spirit guide or--"

500
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.352
<v Regina>Think paranormal events.</v>

501
00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:34.685
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>Yeah, exactly.</v>

502
00:20:34.685 --> 00:20:36.754
<v ->And I say meditation is boring.</v>

503
00:20:36.754 --> 00:20:37.789
It's boring.

504
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:40.958
But what's exciting is when we walk through the world

505
00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.761
and our intentions and desires are manifested

506
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:46.631
and we find that we're much more intuitive

507
00:20:46.631 --> 00:20:48.501
and we can hear ourselves

508
00:20:48.501 --> 00:20:52.037
and we have the access to spontaneous right action,

509
00:20:52.037 --> 00:20:55.540
and we feel a sense of silence permeating

510
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.943
the noise of the world out there.

511
00:20:57.943 --> 00:21:00.346
And I think that that is,

512
00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:02.413
that's where the benefits show up in meditation.

513
00:21:02.413 --> 00:21:04.015
Yes, you can have some exciting things

514
00:21:04.015 --> 00:21:06.885
happen in meditation, but it's rare.

515
00:21:06.885 --> 00:21:09.588
I mean I've lived in monasteries for a couple of years.

516
00:21:09.588 --> 00:21:11.356
I lived in an ashram.

517
00:21:11.356 --> 00:21:15.260
Most of the time, meditation is not thrilling.

518
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.728
(laughs) It's really not.

519
00:21:16.728 --> 00:21:19.164
But what is thrilling is

520
00:21:19.164 --> 00:21:21.799
sort of navigating the world inside,

521
00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:24.835
and it is a practice of turning the attention inward.

522
00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:27.672
Initially, we are going to get more distracted.

523
00:21:27.672 --> 00:21:29.508
It just is the way it is.

524
00:21:29.508 --> 00:21:32.277
But over time, we literally are training

525
00:21:32.277 --> 00:21:34.379
our brain to turn it inward.

526
00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:35.781
Now I know since you've been meditating,

527
00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:37.316
you can close your eyes

528
00:21:37.316 --> 00:21:40.118
and probably access that silence immediately.

529
00:21:40.118 --> 00:21:40.785
<v Regina>Pretty quickly, yeah.</v>

530
00:21:40.785 --> 00:21:42.254
<v ->Yeah, and I can too,</v>

531
00:21:42.254 --> 00:21:44.689
although some days I'd have thousands of thoughts.

532
00:21:44.689 --> 00:21:45.891
<v Regina>Yeah, there are those days,</v>

533
00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:48.294
and usually after about 10 minutes, I'll say,

534
00:21:48.294 --> 00:21:49.394
"I'll try this later.

535
00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:50.161
(Sarah laughs)

536
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:51.797
"It's not gonna give it up today."

537
00:21:51.797 --> 00:21:52.740
<v ->Right, right.</v>

538
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.465
<v Regina>There's too much running in my nervous system.</v>

539
00:21:54.465 --> 00:21:56.968
And this is really critical.

540
00:21:56.968 --> 00:21:59.070
The health of our nervous system is critical

541
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.907
to every function in our lives pretty much,

542
00:22:01.907 --> 00:22:04.075
the way we express ourselves, our emotions,

543
00:22:04.075 --> 00:22:05.443
our mind, our bodies,

544
00:22:05.443 --> 00:22:07.946
and this is literally like having a Saab,

545
00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:11.049
constant tuneup for the nervous system.

546
00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:11.951
<v ->It is.</v>

547
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:12.717
<v Regina>We tend to...</v>

548
00:22:12.717 --> 00:22:14.619
I think many people have looked at it

549
00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:17.155
for so many years as woo-woo,

550
00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:18.123
as a woo-woo thing.

551
00:22:18.123 --> 00:22:18.789
"Oh, it's optional.

552
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:19.690
"Oh, when I get around to...

553
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.993
"Maybe when I retire, I'll get into all of that

554
00:22:21.993 --> 00:22:23.728
"kind of spiritual stuff."
(Sarah laughs)

555
00:22:23.728 --> 00:22:25.797
This is not a spiritual thing.

556
00:22:25.797 --> 00:22:26.644
<v ->No.
<v Regina>And I think it's</v>

557
00:22:26.644 --> 00:22:29.359
very important that we understand

558
00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:33.572
this is an integration of the body, mind, and our intuition,

559
00:22:33.572 --> 00:22:36.143
and we need all of what we can get right now.

560
00:22:36.143 --> 00:22:38.142
<v ->Yes, and I agree with you.</v>

561
00:22:38.142 --> 00:22:40.511
The nervous system, our nervous system

562
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:42.180
has been evolving for thousands,

563
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.848
hundreds of thousands of years.

564
00:22:43.848 --> 00:22:45.049
But if you look at our lives

565
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:48.686
over the last 200 or 300 years even,

566
00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:50.389
with the advent of all these electronics

567
00:22:50.389 --> 00:22:51.923
and capturing fossil fuel

568
00:22:51.923 --> 00:22:54.059
and the way we move food around the world

569
00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:55.760
and we freeze it and microwave it,

570
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.696
and we can stay up all night

571
00:22:57.696 --> 00:23:00.965
talking on the phone or watching TV or working,

572
00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:03.201
we have put on a huge amount of pressure

573
00:23:03.201 --> 00:23:05.570
on our nervous system, our digestive system,

574
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.907
our elimination system, and our rejuvenation system

575
00:23:08.907 --> 00:23:12.610
to really keep up, and it is exhausted.

576
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.046
I mean people are suffering now from adrenal fatigue

577
00:23:15.046 --> 00:23:16.014
because they feel like

578
00:23:16.014 --> 00:23:17.615
they have to over-schedule themselves.

579
00:23:17.615 --> 00:23:19.518
<v Regina>Well, and then you boost it with caffeine,</v>

580
00:23:19.518 --> 00:23:21.286
for example, have a triple espresso

581
00:23:21.286 --> 00:23:22.620
in the morning or what not,

582
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.456
and really take it to super charge going into the day.

583
00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:29.027
And day after day, the entire being

584
00:23:29.027 --> 00:23:30.996
is completely depleted.

585
00:23:30.996 --> 00:23:33.431
And we're looking at not just...

586
00:23:33.431 --> 00:23:35.334
everything that you've just mentioned,

587
00:23:35.334 --> 00:23:37.969
and in addition, the invisible factors.

588
00:23:37.969 --> 00:23:41.072
We have digital information passing.

589
00:23:41.072 --> 00:23:43.474
We can't imagine how much information

590
00:23:43.474 --> 00:23:45.177
is passing through our brains

591
00:23:45.177 --> 00:23:46.511
and our bodies and nervous systems.

592
00:23:46.511 --> 00:23:49.581
Even sitting here in this pristine place in Sedona,

593
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.582
with signals coming from towers and such

594
00:23:51.582 --> 00:23:52.251
<v ->Right.</v>

595
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:54.921
<v Regina>We may not be consciously participating,</v>

596
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.289
but our system's being bombarded with it nonetheless.

597
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:59.691
<v ->Yeah, we just aren't the instrument for receiving it,</v>

598
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:01.148
but if I had my cellphone here, I could--

599
00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:02.094
<v Regina>It's still passing through.</v>

600
00:24:02.094 --> 00:24:02.828
<v ->Right.</v>

601
00:24:02.828 --> 00:24:03.996
<v Regina>Those signals pass through.</v>

602
00:24:03.996 --> 00:24:05.660
I mean they're bouncing off all around.

603
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.338
<v ->Yeah.</v>

604
00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:08.767
<v Regina>And so there is the hidden factor</v>

605
00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:10.235
as well as everything that we are

606
00:24:10.235 --> 00:24:12.470
consciously doing to ourselves.

607
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.304
<v ->Right.</v>

608
00:24:13.304 --> 00:24:15.874
<v Regina>Let's look at what happens when...</v>

609
00:24:15.874 --> 00:24:19.044
There's another element to this that I find really,

610
00:24:19.044 --> 00:24:20.862
this is important.

611
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.618
We are now starting to behave like automatons.

612
00:24:26.618 --> 00:24:28.119
We're walking through life

613
00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:29.622
trying to meet our mortgage payments,

614
00:24:29.622 --> 00:24:31.123
our credit card payments.

615
00:24:31.123 --> 00:24:33.258
Most people are doing things they do not love doing

616
00:24:33.258 --> 00:24:36.662
in order to just be able to put food on their...

617
00:24:36.662 --> 00:24:38.864
Well, as Bush said, "put food on their families,"

618
00:24:38.864 --> 00:24:40.498
(Sarah laughs) but we say food on the...

619
00:24:40.498 --> 00:24:41.333
(both laugh)

620
00:24:41.333 --> 00:24:43.935
food on the table,

621
00:24:43.935 --> 00:24:47.038
and to keep from getting removed from their dwelling.

622
00:24:47.038 --> 00:24:48.039
<v ->Right.</v>

623
00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:51.743
<v Regina>So the very thing that feeds us as beings,</v>

624
00:24:51.743 --> 00:24:55.780
as human beings is our own creativity.

625
00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.458
And I've talked about this in my own

626
00:24:57.458 --> 00:24:58.583
to-te-mic commentary.

627
00:24:58.583 --> 00:25:02.153
We are incredibly unique,

628
00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:04.823
highly creative beings

629
00:25:04.823 --> 00:25:06.825
if we keep ourselves open to it.

630
00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:08.827
But what's happening with what you're talking about,

631
00:25:08.827 --> 00:25:11.262
this adrenal stress and the stress of life,

632
00:25:11.262 --> 00:25:14.799
is we've almost shut off our access to our creativity

633
00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:18.153
in probably 90% of people's lives almost completely.

634
00:25:18.153 --> 00:25:18.803
<v ->Right.</v>

635
00:25:18.803 --> 00:25:19.771
<v Regina>We're living by rote.</v>

636
00:25:19.771 --> 00:25:22.207
We're just a program, a robot running a program.

637
00:25:22.207 --> 00:25:23.225
This is sad.

638
00:25:23.225 --> 00:25:23.988
This is very sad.
<v Sarah>Yeah,</v>

639
00:25:23.988 --> 00:25:24.876
it's a habit of mind.

640
00:25:24.876 --> 00:25:26.744
What we're doing is we get up

641
00:25:26.744 --> 00:25:28.280
and we start having the same thoughts,

642
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.583
I mean it's been said 60 to 90,000 thoughts a day.

643
00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.953
The same ones we have yesterday we're having again today

644
00:25:33.953 --> 00:25:35.853
and having again tomorrow.

645
00:25:35.853 --> 00:25:39.224
And we train the mind that way with these neuronal pathways

646
00:25:39.224 --> 00:25:42.528
to respond to every situation similarly.

647
00:25:42.528 --> 00:25:44.396
And when we don't take a break

648
00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:46.598
from the constant bombardment,

649
00:25:46.598 --> 00:25:50.068
we don't have access to that gap between the thoughts

650
00:25:50.068 --> 00:25:52.470
where all possibilities exist.

651
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.039
<v Regina>True creativity can rise.</v>

652
00:25:54.039 --> 00:25:55.573
<v ->Right, so when we meditate,</v>

653
00:25:55.573 --> 00:25:58.944
we literally are delving that vat of dyes.

654
00:25:58.944 --> 00:26:01.113
One of the qualities is creativity.

655
00:26:01.113 --> 00:26:03.248
One of the qualities is creativity.

656
00:26:03.248 --> 00:26:05.850
If you look at people who meditate,

657
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.320
they find access to a lot of creativity

658
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.521
they never knew they had,

659
00:26:10.521 --> 00:26:12.824
and I've seen amazing things with that.

660
00:26:12.824 --> 00:26:15.093
<v Regina>Instead of watching television all night</v>

661
00:26:15.093 --> 00:26:17.061
or even watching the Internet,

662
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:18.430
like everybody is doing right now

663
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.831
who is watching this interview,

664
00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:22.200
to take the time to be able to, as we say,

665
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.636
make this a practice and quiet the mind

666
00:26:23.636 --> 00:26:25.470
but then access our own creativity.

667
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.940
And it doesn't matter, it can be through

668
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.643
maybe picking up a guitar you haven't touched in 30 years

669
00:26:31.643 --> 00:26:36.048
or it can be cooking, it can be taking a cooking class

670
00:26:36.048 --> 00:26:37.815
or coming up with anything--
<v Sarah>Painting.</v>

671
00:26:37.815 --> 00:26:39.651
<v Regina>It can be painting, poetry,</v>

672
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:41.253
writing, anything,

673
00:26:41.253 --> 00:26:43.787
but that that thing that makes time stand still,

674
00:26:43.787 --> 00:26:46.958
it makes me sad that so few people in the planet

675
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:48.793
actually take time for that thing

676
00:26:48.793 --> 00:26:50.628
that makes time stand still.

677
00:26:50.628 --> 00:26:52.430
<v ->Well, when you say time stands still,</v>

678
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.665
it's a great analogy for meditation

679
00:26:54.665 --> 00:26:58.570
because the world out there is a form and phenomenon.

680
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.939
Things exist in time and space.

681
00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:03.241
And when we transcend the world out there

682
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:05.343
through closing our eyes and meditating,

683
00:27:05.343 --> 00:27:09.214
we literally transcend time and space,

684
00:27:09.214 --> 00:27:14.214
and we go to that place of infinite timelessness

685
00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:17.288
and the eternal sense,

686
00:27:17.288 --> 00:27:19.925
and we can just taste it just a little bit,

687
00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:21.626
and so we are able to,

688
00:27:21.626 --> 00:27:23.728
when we transcend through meditation,

689
00:27:23.728 --> 00:27:28.033
bring that with us to that transcendence.

690
00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:30.902
And meditation can be done anywhere.

691
00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:33.271
You can close your eyes, sit comfortably.

692
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:35.874
You don't need to do special hand positions.

693
00:27:35.874 --> 00:27:40.245
You don't need a special cushion or love beads or a diet.

694
00:27:40.245 --> 00:27:42.313
Simply sitting down with your eyes closed,

695
00:27:42.313 --> 00:27:44.082
turning your cellphone off,

696
00:27:44.082 --> 00:27:47.385
planning, I'd say, to start,

697
00:27:47.385 --> 00:27:50.655
10 to 20 minutes, I'd love to say twice a day,

698
00:27:50.655 --> 00:27:52.924
but even if you do it once a day,

699
00:27:52.924 --> 00:27:55.694
closing the eyes, planning the 10 minutes,

700
00:27:55.694 --> 00:27:58.230
sitting down focusing on your breath initially,

701
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.764
relaxing the body,

702
00:27:59.764 --> 00:28:02.700
paying attention to the way the body feels,

703
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.970
then bringing your attention to the breath,

704
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.138
and then you can start that mantra,

705
00:28:07.138 --> 00:28:09.207
I suggested "so" on the inhale,

706
00:28:09.207 --> 00:28:10.842
"hum" on the exhale,

707
00:28:10.842 --> 00:28:12.410
and simply just paying attention

708
00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.746
to the sound of the sounds.

709
00:28:14.746 --> 00:28:18.149
And you can time yourself by looking at a clock.

710
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:21.086
Basically though, I do suggest people time themselves

711
00:28:21.086 --> 00:28:22.821
and to stick with the amount of time

712
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:24.889
they've already decided to do it.

713
00:28:24.889 --> 00:28:28.026
And one of the most important things I like to say is

714
00:28:28.026 --> 00:28:31.796
at the very end of it, sit with your eyes closed

715
00:28:31.796 --> 00:28:34.432
and just in the silence for a minute or two

716
00:28:34.432 --> 00:28:36.034
before opening the eyes.

717
00:28:36.034 --> 00:28:37.903
Because when we meditate,

718
00:28:37.903 --> 00:28:41.606
subjectively, we might not feel like we've gone very deep.

719
00:28:41.606 --> 00:28:43.541
But if we were to measure your brain waves

720
00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:44.909
and measure your blood pressure

721
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:46.644
and measure your respiration rate,

722
00:28:46.644 --> 00:28:48.279
we would find that just by sitting there

723
00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:51.082
repeating a word that has no meaning

724
00:28:51.082 --> 00:28:53.718
does slow down the respiration rate,

725
00:28:53.718 --> 00:28:55.520
does reduce the blood pressure.

726
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.405
<v Regina>Well, you know that if you try</v>

727
00:28:56.405 --> 00:28:58.322
to come out of it too quickly

728
00:28:58.322 --> 00:29:00.791
because your head is flooded (laughs).

729
00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:03.462
Just trying to come back to consciousness

730
00:29:03.462 --> 00:29:05.663
of the world around you, it's very disconcerting

731
00:29:05.663 --> 00:29:07.500
if you don't take that extra minute or two.

732
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.833
<v ->It's important because you're literally</v>

733
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:10.802
at a different state of consciousness.

734
00:29:10.802 --> 00:29:13.139
And it's different than what you're used to.

735
00:29:13.139 --> 00:29:16.809
We're all used to being either awake, asleep, or dreaming.

736
00:29:16.809 --> 00:29:18.610
But when we meditate, we're literally

737
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.379
in a fourth state of consciousness,

738
00:29:20.379 --> 00:29:23.081
which some people call soul awareness

739
00:29:23.081 --> 00:29:24.616
or glimpsing the soul,

740
00:29:24.616 --> 00:29:26.885
Deepak Chopra calls it glimpsing the soul,

741
00:29:26.885 --> 00:29:29.487
or even atma darshan,

742
00:29:29.487 --> 00:29:32.056
which means keeping the company of your own soul.

743
00:29:32.056 --> 00:29:34.092
And when we're in that state,

744
00:29:34.092 --> 00:29:36.394
our brain waves are in the theta waves,

745
00:29:36.394 --> 00:29:38.162
which is a deep rested state.

746
00:29:38.162 --> 00:29:41.600
So jumping from that into this regular state,

747
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.737
the beta state, we're really moving quickly.

748
00:29:44.737 --> 00:29:46.004
It's just like jumping out of bed

749
00:29:46.004 --> 00:29:48.573
when you think you're late for work in the morning.

750
00:29:48.573 --> 00:29:51.411
You know how it sort of colors your day.

751
00:29:51.411 --> 00:29:53.178
This is the same with meditation.

752
00:29:53.178 --> 00:29:55.146
You can't jump from one state to another.

753
00:29:55.146 --> 00:29:58.723
We have to allow that transition period.

754
00:29:58.723 --> 00:30:01.319
<v Regina>And any thoughts on being able to do this</v>

755
00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:05.423
during, as part of your workday, to refresh yourself,

756
00:30:05.423 --> 00:30:07.192
say, at lunch hour or something?

757
00:30:07.192 --> 00:30:08.227
Most people are embarrassed.

758
00:30:08.227 --> 00:30:09.628
"I can't do that at the cubby."

759
00:30:09.628 --> 00:30:10.431
<v ->Right, well--</v>

760
00:30:10.431 --> 00:30:11.296
<v Regina>Some people have said</v>

761
00:30:11.296 --> 00:30:13.798
they even go into the ladies' room or the men's room

762
00:30:13.798 --> 00:30:15.367
and sit there (laughs).

763
00:30:15.367 --> 00:30:18.302
<v ->Well, I've taught a number of reporters who,</v>

764
00:30:18.302 --> 00:30:20.405
they work in these big cubicles,

765
00:30:20.405 --> 00:30:22.473
and I say, "Just go out into your car."

766
00:30:22.473 --> 00:30:24.843
One of my favorite places is meditating in my car.

767
00:30:24.843 --> 00:30:27.645
I taught this one neurosurgeon from Mayo Clinic.

768
00:30:27.645 --> 00:30:29.881
He says, "The minute I get home, my dogs want me,

769
00:30:29.881 --> 00:30:31.984
"my wife wants me, my kids want me."

770
00:30:31.984 --> 00:30:33.485
He goes, "What do I do?"

771
00:30:33.485 --> 00:30:35.252
And I said, "Don't get out of your car.

772
00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:38.445
(Regina laughs) "Park a mile down the street."

773
00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:40.391
Obviously, you can't do it while you're driving,

774
00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:41.860
but park down the street,

775
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.132
close your eyes, lock the door,

776
00:30:44.132 --> 00:30:45.164
time yourself.

777
00:30:45.164 --> 00:30:47.031
Just it's your sanctuary.

778
00:30:47.031 --> 00:30:48.666
Turn the music off though.

779
00:30:48.666 --> 00:30:52.403
Anything that starts to attract your attention outward

780
00:30:52.403 --> 00:30:54.873
is sort of going against what we're trying to do,

781
00:30:54.873 --> 00:30:57.009
which is turning the attention inward.

782
00:30:57.009 --> 00:30:59.610
So closing the eyes, timing it.

783
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.913
I'm in this grocery store parking lot

784
00:31:01.913 --> 00:31:03.749
all the time between appointments.

785
00:31:03.749 --> 00:31:06.684
And ideally, meditate before you eat

786
00:31:06.684 --> 00:31:08.687
because when you eat, the body is really working

787
00:31:08.687 --> 00:31:11.089
to take the world out there

788
00:31:11.089 --> 00:31:13.925
and turn it into the world that we call your body

789
00:31:13.925 --> 00:31:16.561
through food and the digestion process.

790
00:31:16.561 --> 00:31:19.631
So when we meditate, the body starts slowing down,

791
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:21.999
and when we're eating, it starts to speed up.

792
00:31:21.999 --> 00:31:24.135
So we want to do it after we eat,

793
00:31:24.135 --> 00:31:26.237
at least after an hour after we eat,

794
00:31:26.237 --> 00:31:28.140
or before we eat.

795
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.076
<v Regina>Let's talk about insomniacs</v>

796
00:31:30.076 --> 00:31:33.444
because I mean this does affect sleep patterns,

797
00:31:33.444 --> 00:31:36.549
but I personally, I like it when I wake up,

798
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:38.416
if something wakes me up at 3 or 4 in the morning.

799
00:31:38.416 --> 00:31:40.085
That's a beautiful time, I find,

800
00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:41.553
the clearest time to meditate.

801
00:31:41.553 --> 00:31:45.256
There's not a lot of any kind of noise of any kind,

802
00:31:45.256 --> 00:31:47.759
physical, psychic noise, you name it.

803
00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:52.064
But what about using this for sleep disturbances

804
00:31:52.064 --> 00:31:52.830
or sleep patterns?

805
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.832
<v Sarah>That's a great question.</v>

806
00:31:53.832 --> 00:31:56.535
Well, one of the things, I've read a lot of research,

807
00:31:56.535 --> 00:31:58.971
and a lot of the research proves

808
00:31:58.971 --> 00:32:02.373
that meditation helps to reduce sleeping medication,

809
00:32:02.373 --> 00:32:04.443
helps to improve the quality of sleep,

810
00:32:04.443 --> 00:32:07.913
and sleep is the number one way we get rid of stress

811
00:32:07.913 --> 00:32:09.046
in our nervous system.

812
00:32:09.046 --> 00:32:10.748
So when we have so much stress

813
00:32:10.748 --> 00:32:13.150
that it starts to affect the quality of our sleep,

814
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.952
really, it's a double whammy.

815
00:32:14.952 --> 00:32:17.055
We are not able to recover quickly.

816
00:32:17.055 --> 00:32:19.724
So yes, meditation has been proven

817
00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:21.760
to increase the quality of sleep.

818
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.696
Now I wanna just explain this because,

819
00:32:24.696 --> 00:32:27.265
because sometimes, when we finish meditating,

820
00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:28.600
we feel really relaxed.

821
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.769
It feels like, "Oh, I could go right to sleep."

822
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:34.873
But over time, you're going to really feel clearer.

823
00:32:34.873 --> 00:32:36.330
It's sort of this clear awareness.

824
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.145
<v Regina>Right.</v>

825
00:32:37.145 --> 00:32:40.212
<v ->So ideally, you don't meditate right before bed.</v>

826
00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:43.248
You meditate before, ideally before breakfast

827
00:32:43.248 --> 00:32:45.017
and then again before dinner.

828
00:32:45.017 --> 00:32:47.919
If you can't do one of those, you can do it before lunch.

829
00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:50.255
But you've mentioned the yogic hour.

830
00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:52.691
There is this hour between 4 and 6 am,

831
00:32:52.691 --> 00:32:54.425
before sunrise.
<v Regina>Mm, it's wonderful.</v>

832
00:32:54.425 --> 00:32:56.094
<v ->It's traditional for meditation.</v>

833
00:32:56.094 --> 00:32:57.829
That's the ambrosia hour.

834
00:32:57.829 --> 00:33:00.264
And when I lived in a Zen Buddhist monastery,

835
00:33:00.264 --> 00:33:02.500
we would be awake at that time

836
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.370
and we would start our first meditation before 5.

837
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.506
And that is the time where the nervous system

838
00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:10.975
has gotten its deep rest from sleep

839
00:33:10.975 --> 00:33:13.912
so that you're not dealing with the big stresses

840
00:33:13.912 --> 00:33:16.381
but you're actually able to refine

841
00:33:16.381 --> 00:33:20.251
some of the other stresses that might get in the way

842
00:33:20.251 --> 00:33:21.653
of you listening to you.

843
00:33:21.653 --> 00:33:23.923
<v Regina>Mm-hmm, it's a lovely experience.</v>

844
00:33:23.923 --> 00:33:24.823
<v ->It is.</v>

845
00:33:24.823 --> 00:33:26.358
<v Regina>It's my favorite (laughs).</v>

846
00:33:26.358 --> 00:33:28.559
I mean when you're in there, in that state,

847
00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:31.562
I could just get lost and stay there for hours,

848
00:33:31.562 --> 00:33:33.966
but that's usually not something that's desirable.

849
00:33:33.966 --> 00:33:35.267
(Sarah laughs) There's no time.

850
00:33:35.267 --> 00:33:36.074
<v ->You got to get out and work (laughs)</v>

851
00:33:36.074 --> 00:33:37.134
<v Regina>Yeah, you got to get out and work</v>

852
00:33:37.134 --> 00:33:40.271
and get on with my life, but it's very beautiful.

853
00:33:40.271 --> 00:33:41.973
Any final thoughts on this?

854
00:33:41.973 --> 00:33:45.077
I mean you've given a lot of really practical information

855
00:33:45.077 --> 00:33:47.512
because people do think, "Oh, I'll wait 'til later.

856
00:33:47.512 --> 00:33:48.346
"I'm intimidated.

857
00:33:48.346 --> 00:33:49.814
"Maybe I'll do it on the weekend."

858
00:33:49.814 --> 00:33:51.916
But you've given us a lot of ideas,

859
00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:54.086
how you can incorporate into your everyday life.

860
00:33:54.086 --> 00:33:55.721
It doesn't have to take a lot of time.

861
00:33:55.721 --> 00:33:58.624
Any other final thoughts on the imperative

862
00:33:58.624 --> 00:34:01.760
as to why this should be mandatory

863
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.195
for every human being on the planet?

864
00:34:04.195 --> 00:34:05.630
<v ->Well, I think that a lot of us,</v>

865
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:06.964
you had said this earlier,

866
00:34:06.964 --> 00:34:09.247
are doing things we don't really like that we're doing,

867
00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.670
and it's again the habit of mind.

868
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.805
And I think meditation really helps us

869
00:34:13.805 --> 00:34:18.142
to focus on who we really are outside of

870
00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:21.680
whether it's a sickness or our jobs or our family,

871
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.984
who we really are and what we really want.

872
00:34:24.984 --> 00:34:27.619
I was always afraid to ask for what I wanted

873
00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:29.588
because I didn't even know what it was.

874
00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:31.756
And I had voices in my head from family members

875
00:34:31.756 --> 00:34:34.460
who would say, "Can't you stop being so selfish?"

876
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.928
or, "I wouldn't do that if I were you,"

877
00:34:36.928 --> 00:34:39.831
or that kind of thing which sort of thwarted

878
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:42.266
my own conversation with myself.

879
00:34:42.266 --> 00:34:44.836
And I think meditation helps us to reconnect

880
00:34:44.836 --> 00:34:47.138
with what we really want,

881
00:34:47.138 --> 00:34:49.474
what really makes our soul sing,

882
00:34:49.474 --> 00:34:52.767
and that's the real reason that we're here.

883
00:34:52.767 --> 00:34:55.480
We each need to sing our song, really,

884
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.349
and I'm not trying to be esoteric.

885
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:59.485
It's how can we do that

886
00:34:59.485 --> 00:35:01.286
without taking somebody else's idea

887
00:35:01.286 --> 00:35:04.055
of what that looks like and imposing it on ourselves.

888
00:35:04.055 --> 00:35:06.425
So meditation helps us to get clear about that.

889
00:35:06.425 --> 00:35:08.560
<v Regina>Absolutely, and break out of the prison</v>

890
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.596
of habit, of habitual living.

891
00:35:11.596 --> 00:35:13.131
<v ->Exactly.</v>

892
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:14.967
<v Regina>And so I thank you so much</v>

893
00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:16.468
for taking the time with us.

894
00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:18.637
And we never got to know each other

895
00:35:18.637 --> 00:35:20.371
when I was living in Sedona all those years,

896
00:35:20.371 --> 00:35:21.606
which I'm amazed because

897
00:35:21.606 --> 00:35:22.874
I was right down the street from you

898
00:35:22.874 --> 00:35:24.709
and there is a really beautiful resonance here,

899
00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:27.512
and I'm glad that finally, we came together now.

900
00:35:27.512 --> 00:35:28.446
<v ->This is the time.
<v Regina>It's a pleasure</v>

901
00:35:28.446 --> 00:35:29.447
meeting you, Sarah.

902
00:35:29.447 --> 00:35:30.749
<v ->Thank you.</v>

903
00:35:30.749 --> 00:35:32.451
(tranquil music)

904
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:34.184
<v ->Every one of us needs to take</v>

905
00:35:34.184 --> 00:35:37.088
quiet time for ourselves now more than ever.

906
00:35:37.088 --> 00:35:38.890
If you need a little help getting going,

907
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.193
you can connect with Sarah's work through her website

908
00:35:41.193 --> 00:35:43.294
at sedonameditation.com.

909
00:35:43.294 --> 00:35:44.930
She has some very helpful CDs

910
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.197
to help you find your zone

911
00:35:46.197 --> 00:35:48.299
so you can begin having the benefits

912
00:35:48.299 --> 00:35:51.502
of a clear connection with your own greatest truths.

913
00:35:51.502 --> 00:35:52.637
Until next time.

914
00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:54.469
Thanks for watching CMN.
