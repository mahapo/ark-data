(soft music)

2
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.151
<v ->Everything we think, sense, and feel,</v>

3
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.952
is based on frequencies.

4
00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.432
Only in the last few decades has science allowed

5
00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:24.331
for the existence of frequencies,

6
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.822
when looking at our personal health and well-being.

7
00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:29.272
Penney Peirce has been focused on frequency

8
00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:32.099
however, for decades, and explores the dynamic world

9
00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.980
of energy, and our ability to harness it

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.510
in her newest book titled Frequency.

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.260
In the end, this work is dedicated to helping people

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.559
open up to their intuitive powers,

13
00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.450
to regain control over their own circumstance.

14
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.080
Some noted authors and visionaries say

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.680
this book is an unprecedented gift

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.970
for those who are ready to evolve.

17
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.019
<v Interviewer>Penney, I love your book Frequency.</v>

18
00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.419
This is something that has to be addressed

19
00:00:58.419 --> 00:01:00.839
because we're a time of changing frequencies,

20
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.522
and the people tend to assign us to woo woo.

21
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.023
But this is not a woo woo thing,

22
00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:08.303
we have some genuine changes of frequency.

23
00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:10.343
In your book you go through it from

24
00:01:10.343 --> 00:01:12.583
a geophysical point of view right from

25
00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:14.823
Greg Benning's early work, all the way

26
00:01:14.823 --> 00:01:17.623
up to what's happening with this buzzing thing

27
00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:19.962
happening with people's bodies.

28
00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:23.302
So I would like you to start by telling us

29
00:01:23.302 --> 00:01:25.382
a really fun little story, first about

30
00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.183
why you decided to write Frequency,

31
00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:30.823
and then how the title came to you around

32
00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:32.923
your father's passing and movies,

33
00:01:32.923 --> 00:01:34.483
it's really interesting.

34
00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:38.153
<v ->Well, the actual fun story which isn't in the book</v>

35
00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:42.393
is that I had outlined a book on empathy

36
00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.383
and presented it to my publisher

37
00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:46.423
who had published The Secret.

38
00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:48.685
And she sad, oh that sounds great,

39
00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.626
let's not tell anybody about it you know.

40
00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:54.556
So she went out on tour with Rhonda Burn

41
00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:57.746
and came back from that tour and called me and said

42
00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:00.387
Penney I don't think people are ready for Empathy yet.

43
00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:01.647
(chuckles)

44
00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:03.347
So if they're not ready for Empathy,

45
00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.177
could you re-work it?

46
00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:06.967
So I went back to the drawing board

47
00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:09.767
and I reorganized all the concepts

48
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:14.167
and started seeing that the ultra-sensitivity

49
00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.667
and the empathy, was part of a process

50
00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.587
of this acceleration of consciousness

51
00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:22.276
which was part of a process of transformation.

52
00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:24.727
And everything started to kind of come together

53
00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:29.627
in a amalgamation, and in the early stages of it,

54
00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:33.187
it was a strange weaving of ideas.

55
00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.317
I didn't know how I was going to write about it.

56
00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:38.907
But it came, it just kept coming together.

57
00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:41.638
So, okay what am I gonna call this thing?

58
00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:45.029
You know, and I had all pages of possible titles

59
00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.869
and subtitles and going over and over, and over, and over,

60
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.029
cause I like to write from a title.

61
00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.633
<v Interviewer>Yes I know what you mean,</v>

62
00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.773
it gives it, it's kind of a headstone identity.

63
00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.013
<v ->Yes, it's kind of starts to crystallize</v>

64
00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:59.194
and then it can come down, you know and, so I was just.

65
00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:03.778
So I was out of the coffee shop, and I suddenly

66
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:06.468
my hand wrote the word Frequency.

67
00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:10.028
And I thought, gee that's great,

68
00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:12.908
but oh I can't do that because that's the name of a movie.

69
00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:15.538
And I thought, well maybe I can.

70
00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:18.598
And then suddenly, I had this whole memory thing

71
00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:22.497
about my father because he died,

72
00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:27.378
it was a very strange situation, he died alone,

73
00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:31.618
they didn't find him for four days, and when he died,

74
00:03:32.488 --> 00:03:34.787
at the exact time he died.

75
00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:37.877
That morning I was trying to write another book,

76
00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:40.447
my previous book, and I couldn't think.

77
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.818
I just kept standing up from the computer

78
00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:45.058
and walking and pacing around my house,

79
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.568
and I thought, but I don't know what's going on.

80
00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:50.278
Forget it, I'm not even gonna try it,

81
00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:51.757
I'm just gonna go play hooky,

82
00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:53.548
and I decided to go to the movies.

83
00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:55.478
I didn't even know what was playing,

84
00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:59.168
I just drove there, and Frequency was playing.

85
00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:00.468
<v Interviewer>Isn't that amazing?</v>

86
00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:03.338
<v ->And so I go in and I'm in that movie.</v>

87
00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:07.008
At the exact time when my father was actually dying,

88
00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:09.898
and the movie of course is about a man

89
00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:12.838
who speaks to his dead father through time,

90
00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:16.878
you know, by some strange freak of nature you know.

91
00:04:16.878 --> 00:04:21.628
And so it's all about this communication.

92
00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:25.181
And I suddenly, when I wrote that word,

93
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.471
I felt my father there, and he was just like laughing.

94
00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:32.490
Like ha ha, yeah, he said, this is it.

95
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.380
And so I proceeded and you know that.

96
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.541
<v Interviewer>And Frequency was born.</v>

97
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:38.761
<v ->Yes.</v>

98
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:41.401
<v Interviewer>And it is, this is a time of such</v>

99
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:44.221
powerful frequencies, and we were talking off camera

100
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:47.941
a moment ago about where do we even start this conversation?

101
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:50.391
We can go in so many directions but

102
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.340
let's start with kind of, maybe a central point

103
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.320
for a lot of people which is a sense of time speeding up

104
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.839
and uncomfortableness, people feeling stuck,

105
00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.099
like there's more to live and they can feel it,

106
00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.310
like knocking on their door and some cases

107
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.963
they can't get unstuck, can't identify.

108
00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:10.483
Let's just start down the road,

109
00:05:10.483 --> 00:05:12.643
what are we all experiencing right now and why?

110
00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:15.423
<v ->Well, I am not sure why exactly the acceleration</v>

111
00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:18.323
is happening although you know, the Mayan calendar

112
00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:21.543
talks about this acceleration of time, like speeding up

113
00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:25.603
every 20 times every certain period of time

114
00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.503
and getting faster and faster.

115
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:33.373
My experience of it is that the speeding up of life

116
00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:36.343
and the higher frequency of the planet itself

117
00:05:36.343 --> 00:05:39.163
speeds up the physical plane which speeds up our bodies,

118
00:05:39.163 --> 00:05:41.623
which speeds up our emotions and our mind,

119
00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:43.634
and our consciousness in general.

120
00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:47.023
So that we start matching the spiritual realm,

121
00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:50.914
which is so high anyway and it's very stable.

122
00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:54.143
But our physical point is rising,

123
00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:55.964
so that we're starting to intersect with it

124
00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:58.653
and overlap with it, so we're getting bleed-through

125
00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:02.823
of a lot of higher ideas and you know even more love

126
00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:07.293
and it's changing us at a fundamental level.

127
00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:10.303
Cause we can't get out of the field of the earth,

128
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:13.423
we are physical, we're part of it, you know.

129
00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:18.423
So that acceleration I think, is causing so many

130
00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:22.053
fundamental changes in who we are.

131
00:06:23.863 --> 00:06:27.363
As it accelerates the vibration of the physical body,

132
00:06:27.363 --> 00:06:29.363
we start to have symptoms, you know.

133
00:06:29.363 --> 00:06:33.432
If we're vibrating faster and if you resist that.

134
00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.202
Because at first you can feel like

135
00:06:35.202 --> 00:06:36.682
you're getting out of control, you know,

136
00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:39.292
and it's, you know, crazy making.

137
00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:44.377
It creates anxiety, it creates trouble sleeping, you know.

138
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.387
<v Interviewer>A lot of people are having trouble sleeping.</v>

139
00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:51.387
<v ->Oh insomnia ,heart pounding, rashes, heat,</v>

140
00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:55.687
you know, and all kinds of you know, skin problems

141
00:06:55.687 --> 00:07:00.387
and heat leaving the body and hyperactivity.

142
00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:01.687
You know, so many things.

143
00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.067
I outlined a lot of the symptoms in the book,

144
00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:09.267
and part of that is if you trust the process

145
00:07:09.267 --> 00:07:11.107
and you know what's going on,

146
00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:13.387
then you don't try to force it back down

147
00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:15.247
and resist it, but you embrace it

148
00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:17.747
and you just let go into it and let the energy

149
00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.607
flow through you and you move with it.

150
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.717
You know, you join the flow.

151
00:07:23.627 --> 00:07:25.907
If you're afraid, which of course it does

152
00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:30.127
start to make people afraid because it's literally

153
00:07:30.127 --> 00:07:33.387
speeding up the vibration of the subconscious mind also.

154
00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:36.187
And I think what's happening there is that

155
00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:39.747
we used to be able to suppress negative memories

156
00:07:39.747 --> 00:07:41.747
and things that we didn't wanna look at.

157
00:07:41.747 --> 00:07:43.167
We just pretend they weren't there,

158
00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.767
and then they weren't there you know.

159
00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:46.647
But now you can't suppress it anymore

160
00:07:46.647 --> 00:07:49.327
cause it's all getting higher vibrational,

161
00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:53.327
and that low vibration stuff can't stay in place anymore.

162
00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:56.587
So I liken that to popcorn popping, you know,

163
00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:58.607
it's like boom, here there comes this stuff,

164
00:07:58.607 --> 00:08:01.327
up into the conscious mind.

165
00:08:01.327 --> 00:08:02.647
<v Interviewer>And I've noticed that with</v>

166
00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:04.867
a lot of people including myself,

167
00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:07.427
it's almost mirroring.

168
00:08:07.427 --> 00:08:09.927
Well it is, it's all part of the same thing,

169
00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:12.487
this general theme of as I've called it before,

170
00:08:12.487 --> 00:08:16.549
if you were raised a Christian, the notion of Revelations.

171
00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:18.848
Well to me, Revelations is simple to be revealed,

172
00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:20.348
everything is being revealed now.

173
00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:23.248
People can't keep their secrets, their habits,

174
00:08:23.248 --> 00:08:27.449
their maybe poor decision making

175
00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.129
and the results of that, can't keep it down anymore,

176
00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:31.629
it is all rising to the surface.

177
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:33.449
<v ->It is, along with the good stuff too.</v>

178
00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:35.109
<v Interviewer>And the good stuff, yeah, absolutely.</v>

179
00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:40.109
<v ->And I think that the fear based thought</v>

180
00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:42.989
and ideas and beliefs and fixed things

181
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.029
that have been contracted and held

182
00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:48.038
have blocked the flow of the soul.

183
00:08:48.448 --> 00:08:51.688
So as the soul energy gets higher and faster

184
00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:54.968
and more prevalent, and the body is rising to that,

185
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.649
that stuff's just in the way, you know.

186
00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:01.389
And it has to be free from its hiding places,

187
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:04.288
so that it can be understood and released and cleared.

188
00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:07.949
So the soul energy can come through all the way.

189
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:11.169
In other words, so that that merger of the worlds

190
00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:13.928
can complete itself, and that's evolution,

191
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.448
you know, of spiritual evolution.

192
00:09:16.448 --> 00:09:17.889
<v Interviewer>So here we have the conscious mind</v>

193
00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:20.249
which sits as the ever vigilant gatekeeper

194
00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:22.789
to see that we do things the way we want,

195
00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:23.889
have things the way we want,

196
00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:26.089
that conscious mind doesn't like change.

197
00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:27.609
<v ->Well I call that the left brain,</v>

198
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.009
I'm just differentiating right now

199
00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:32.829
because I do believe that the left brain

200
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:36.189
is part of what it has learned to do over time,

201
00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:40.229
is to try to suppress any kind of fear in the right brain,

202
00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:42.389
but it also ends up suppressing intuition

203
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:45.689
and revelation and inspiration, and all kinds of things.

204
00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:46.469
<v Interviewer>It's controlling.</v>

205
00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:48.469
<v ->It's controlling, but it's also negative.</v>

206
00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:52.468
And we've gotten used to living in the left brain,

207
00:09:52.468 --> 00:09:55.509
as a culture, you know, as a world almost

208
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:59.949
and revere it, and it's methodology

209
00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:03.919
of cause and effect linear perception, and isolated.

210
00:10:04.349 --> 00:10:06.569
You know, the left brain is separated from

211
00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.289
the rest of the body, you know,

212
00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:13.011
it perceives itself as an individual thing, and the ego.

213
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.511
You know, as long as you're focused in the left brain

214
00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:19.911
and validating it, we have what I call old perception

215
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.221
which is slow.

216
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:24.771
You have separation between things,

217
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:26.252
it slows everything down.

218
00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:27.691
You have unity between things,

219
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:28.731
it speeds everything up.

220
00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:29.471
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

221
00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:30.021
<v ->Right?</v>

222
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:33.821
So I see one of the main problems

223
00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:36.301
we're dealing with now, is learning how to shift

224
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:38.521
out of only left brain.

225
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:39.461
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

226
00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:42.401
<v ->To go back to the right brain, then to merge them, right?</v>

227
00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:44.241
Cause there's nothing wrong with the left brain,

228
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:46.581
it just needs to learn its place, you know,

229
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.841
and do what it's good at, and not try to be the,

230
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:51.551
you know, master of everything,

231
00:10:51.641 --> 00:10:53.132
cause it doesn't know enough.

232
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:54.141
<v Interviewer>Yes, and not only that,</v>

233
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:57.482
it doesn't all that subtleinformation to come through

234
00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:00.982
which is really our guide in terms of

235
00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:02.745
what we're going to find our way feel.

236
00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.666
You talk a lot about feeling your way

237
00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:07.926
through to things, and this left brain gatekeeper

238
00:11:07.926 --> 00:11:10.966
doesn't allow that and it's,

239
00:11:10.966 --> 00:11:12.727
you know I'll just have a little easier time of it

240
00:11:12.727 --> 00:11:14.627
because they have to access this, musicians,

241
00:11:14.627 --> 00:11:16.908
these artist of all kinds, writers.

242
00:11:16.908 --> 00:11:19.228
But for people who've been trying to survive

243
00:11:19.228 --> 00:11:21.508
and do jobs that really require

244
00:11:21.508 --> 00:11:23.308
using the left side of the brain.

245
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:26.568
A lot of these people that I know in my life personally,

246
00:11:26.568 --> 00:11:28.748
really are stuck in terms of being able

247
00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:31.408
to dream up anything, it's like the dreaming capacity

248
00:11:31.408 --> 00:11:32.787
has been shut down.

249
00:11:32.787 --> 00:11:36.827
<v ->Yeah, the imagination is seen as something silly,</v>

250
00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:38.428
you know, it's not.

251
00:11:38.428 --> 00:11:41.452
You know when I started teaching intuition years ago,

252
00:11:41.452 --> 00:11:44.392
you couldn't say the word intuition to a business person.

253
00:11:44.392 --> 00:11:45.272
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

254
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:46.132
<v ->It was.</v>

255
00:11:46.132 --> 00:11:47.532
<v Interviewer>You could say gut feeling.</v>

256
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:50.372
<v ->You could say, fly by the seat of your pants, you know.</v>

257
00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:53.933
But intuition, you know that was like psychic,

258
00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:55.773
it was absolutely equated.

259
00:11:55.773 --> 00:11:58.173
And it wasn't understood that really intuition

260
00:11:58.173 --> 00:12:01.093
is often the source of the great ideas

261
00:12:01.093 --> 00:12:03.693
which then the left brain can take and implement,

262
00:12:03.693 --> 00:12:06.573
you know, that those parts can work together.

263
00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:10.533
But it's gaining its popularity now

264
00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:13.722
and getting more mainstream, which is great.

265
00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.052
<v Interviewer>And you address this in the book,</v>

266
00:12:15.052 --> 00:12:17.912
and get techniques and as to how to feel

267
00:12:17.912 --> 00:12:20.052
your way back to that side of your joy

268
00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:21.112
and your creativity.

269
00:12:21.112 --> 00:12:22.193
And we'll get to that in a little bit

270
00:12:22.193 --> 00:12:24.172
because joy is a big part of this process which,

271
00:12:24.883 --> 00:12:26.823
I'm hearing this now reflected in the work

272
00:12:26.823 --> 00:12:28.204
of many many people.

273
00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:30.683
This, and it's not just that follow your bliss,

274
00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:33.164
oh, find your joy, no this is a very practical

275
00:12:33.164 --> 00:12:36.474
energetic frequency dimension to our lives.

276
00:12:37.464 --> 00:12:42.394
<v ->We are learning to allow the body to raise its frequency.</v>

277
00:12:43.404 --> 00:12:45.544
And then when that happens of course, like you said

278
00:12:45.544 --> 00:12:48.124
the subconscious empties, the spirit comes through,

279
00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:51.584
so you get both this kind of fear-based knowledge

280
00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:53.264
and love-based knowledge, let's call it

281
00:12:53.264 --> 00:12:55.284
a unity-based awareness.

282
00:12:55.284 --> 00:12:59.514
And then the challenge now is, learn to discriminate.

283
00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:02.394
What is it I'm feeling?

284
00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:05.734
What data is coming to me through energy itself?

285
00:13:05.964 --> 00:13:09.224
Because you know, we're now seeing ourselves differently,

286
00:13:09.224 --> 00:13:12.288
we're not just like bodies separated from each other.

287
00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:16.244
We're actually energy-based, consciousness-based beings,

288
00:13:16.244 --> 00:13:20.324
emersed in a sea of energy of the unified field.

289
00:13:20.324 --> 00:13:22.204
So we're in the boundaries.

290
00:13:22.204 --> 00:13:25.103
When you feel energy, there are no boundaries,

291
00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:28.364
and everything starts to become mutually inclusive

292
00:13:28.364 --> 00:13:32.124
and interconnected, and very easy to communicate

293
00:13:32.124 --> 00:13:35.884
without any effort or to allow things to precipitate

294
00:13:35.884 --> 00:13:40.114
and manifest without will power, it's so much easier.

295
00:13:40.244 --> 00:13:43.524
But the rules are changing, of one,

296
00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:46.664
the way life works literally, and two,

297
00:13:46.664 --> 00:13:50.344
the way we know ourselves and who we think we are.

298
00:13:50.344 --> 00:13:53.284
Our identity is going though fundamental change,

299
00:13:53.284 --> 00:13:54.974
it's huge really.

300
00:13:55.944 --> 00:14:00.574
And then we're having memory coming back of,

301
00:14:01.084 --> 00:14:03.444
I love when Barbara Han Claus says in her book

302
00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:06.624
of the Planetary Mind, where she's saying that,

303
00:14:06.774 --> 00:14:10.443
there was a cataclysm back, you know, 9500 B.C

304
00:14:10.443 --> 00:14:13.843
that has been very suppressed, but that it lives

305
00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:15.984
in the collective subconscious of humanity

306
00:14:15.984 --> 00:14:18.364
and it's starting to surface.

307
00:14:18.364 --> 00:14:20.924
And we're starting to feel this terror

308
00:14:20.924 --> 00:14:23.184
that was from that time,

309
00:14:23.184 --> 00:14:25.844
but we're projecting it on to the future.

310
00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:29.204
Onto 2012 even, you know, or in certain time periods

311
00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:32.564
but it's really not here, it's in the past,

312
00:14:32.564 --> 00:14:34.454
but it's surfacing.

313
00:14:34.804 --> 00:14:38.084
And so that surfacing also then means

314
00:14:38.084 --> 00:14:39.824
that we don't have really any restrictions

315
00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:43.214
on what we can know, it's all there.

316
00:14:43.844 --> 00:14:45.944
And that means you can't process information

317
00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:48.424
in a linear way anymore, and that means

318
00:14:48.424 --> 00:14:53.424
the information age has almost reached it's end I think,

319
00:14:53.623 --> 00:14:58.104
and that it's more poised on this energetic edge

320
00:14:58.104 --> 00:15:00.764
where we're shifting into, I'm calling it,

321
00:15:00.764 --> 00:15:04.643
the intuition age because, intuition and spirit now

322
00:15:04.643 --> 00:15:06.624
are gonna, and energy and consciousness

323
00:15:06.624 --> 00:15:10.064
are the basis for this new way of knowing,

324
00:15:10.064 --> 00:15:11.473
this new reality.

325
00:15:11.663 --> 00:15:12.683
<v Interviewer>And it's interesting because</v>

326
00:15:12.683 --> 00:15:14.943
when you get into intuition, away from information

327
00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:17.704
you're talking abut going into more of a,

328
00:15:19.423 --> 00:15:21.203
what do you call, the Mobius Infinity Loop

329
00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:22.744
in terms of time and space.

330
00:15:22.744 --> 00:15:24.264
And now as you just said, many people

331
00:15:24.264 --> 00:15:27.544
are remembering that time, many people I know

332
00:15:27.544 --> 00:15:30.684
personally even, including myself, have very clear

333
00:15:30.684 --> 00:15:32.663
memories of what happened at that time,

334
00:15:32.663 --> 00:15:35.583
and it's a very emotional thing locked into the body.

335
00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:39.183
It is very, I mean, whenever I choose to go look at it

336
00:15:39.183 --> 00:15:41.683
I just, tears start pouring out

337
00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:44.503
because it was so dramatic to have lost so much

338
00:15:44.503 --> 00:15:47.823
as a species at one time, so quickly even.

339
00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:50.843
And so, but still it's showing us that

340
00:15:50.843 --> 00:15:53.523
our mind is able to access beyond time ans space.

341
00:15:53.523 --> 00:15:55.133
<v ->Yes.</v>

342
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:58.323
<v Interviewer>And this is really critical now, isn't it?</v>

343
00:15:58.323 --> 00:15:59.683
In creating.

344
00:15:59.683 --> 00:16:04.617
<v ->It is, I think that this process of acceleration is,</v>

345
00:16:04.617 --> 00:16:07.337
it's causing this change of vibration

346
00:16:07.337 --> 00:16:09.557
which is causing transformation,

347
00:16:09.557 --> 00:16:12.057
and there are stages in that process, you know.

348
00:16:12.057 --> 00:16:15.237
So the first stages are the clutching of like,

349
00:16:15.237 --> 00:16:16.677
oh I don't wanna go there, you know,

350
00:16:16.677 --> 00:16:18.397
I want and I just stay where was.

351
00:16:18.397 --> 00:16:19.997
But then, the energy keeps going and

352
00:16:19.997 --> 00:16:22.556
you can't hold on, you have to let go.

353
00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:25.136
There are phases in the middle where

354
00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:27.237
we open and close, and open and close,

355
00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.857
and try to re-suppress things,

356
00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:31.497
and try to stay in control, until finally

357
00:16:31.497 --> 00:16:33.777
you can't anymore, you're exhausted.

358
00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:36.777
And then you let go, and relax,

359
00:16:36.777 --> 00:16:39.617
and then the new perspective flows in,

360
00:16:39.617 --> 00:16:40.976
and we start to get the sense of,

361
00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:42.557
oh how is it going to work?

362
00:16:42.557 --> 00:16:43.856
Oh is it gonna be much better?

363
00:16:43.856 --> 00:16:45.277
This is gonna be great.

364
00:16:45.277 --> 00:16:48.236
You know, so this is all coming in now,

365
00:16:48.236 --> 00:16:53.227
and basically, how do you get used to that?

366
00:16:53.636 --> 00:16:55.236
You know, and how do you ease those

367
00:16:55.236 --> 00:16:58.066
difficult parts of the transformation process?

368
00:16:58.156 --> 00:17:00.917
You know, I think that's a lot of what's up today,

369
00:17:00.917 --> 00:17:05.276
and it that process, I'm finally getting to my point here.

370
00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:10.880
The old structures that are based on old thinking,

371
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.840
that are based on left brain, linear consciousness,

372
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.580
politics, you know, the big churches,

373
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.909
all that structure that was ruling the world for so long.

374
00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:24.259
Those won't function anymore, they're too slow.

375
00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:25.219
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

376
00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:26.719
<v ->And they just won't.</v>

377
00:17:26.719 --> 00:17:27.999
<v Interviewer>And their left brain oriented,</v>

378
00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.399
their control orienting, and our beings are really

379
00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:32.979
seeking to move beyond control structures of all kinds.

380
00:17:32.979 --> 00:17:35.580
<v ->And we're going into flow, we're not going</v>

381
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.659
into hold something forever in the same posture

382
00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:41.740
and keep the control over it, it won't work.

383
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.240
So we're going to see the failure

384
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.430
of a lot of those mega structures,

385
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.710
but I think they'll do themselves in mainly,

386
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.070
and you're starting to see it in politics now.

387
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.880
But they will just trip over themselves

388
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.922
and suddenly be seen as really stupid, and like old.

389
00:18:00.922 --> 00:18:02.083
<v Interviewer>As you said, we're seeing it now.</v>

390
00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:05.963
<v ->Yeah, and instead at the same time</v>

391
00:18:05.963 --> 00:18:09.443
as those start to fail, there will be a rising,

392
00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:11.743
which we're also starting to see this year,

393
00:18:11.743 --> 00:18:16.363
of innovation, new ideas, the solution of world problems.

394
00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:20.083
I mean, think things like cancer and AIDS,

395
00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:22.643
and medical things are gonna be solved,

396
00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:25.403
and energy crisis is gonna start to be solved and.

397
00:18:25.403 --> 00:18:28.643
But at the same time, there will be this ego death

398
00:18:28.643 --> 00:18:31.523
of the old, where they gonna fight like crazy

399
00:18:31.523 --> 00:18:33.983
to keep that old alive, and then they'll

400
00:18:33.983 --> 00:18:35.863
just wear themselves out.

401
00:18:35.863 --> 00:18:40.503
While this new part of reality, the innovative people,

402
00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:42.363
are gonna be stronger and stronger,

403
00:18:42.363 --> 00:18:44.204
and they're gonna start to convene.

404
00:18:44.204 --> 00:18:45.474
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

405
00:18:45.484 --> 00:18:49.264
<v ->Because of frequency, so as you start vibrating at,</v>

406
00:18:49.264 --> 00:18:51.304
you know, your home frequency,

407
00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:54.374
is what I called in the book, and other people are also.

408
00:18:55.084 --> 00:18:57.324
You actually start having this odd phenomenon

409
00:18:57.324 --> 00:18:59.994
where you just start showing up in each other's fields.

410
00:19:00.444 --> 00:19:05.444
The like vibration causes you to convene, it's like magic,

411
00:19:06.744 --> 00:19:08.805
and people start meeting each other and coming together,

412
00:19:08.805 --> 00:19:11.605
and having the same ideas for projects,

413
00:19:11.605 --> 00:19:13.025
and they say, oh I've got this piece of it

414
00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:14.005
or I've got this piece of it,

415
00:19:14.005 --> 00:19:16.835
oh okay let's get it together and do it.

416
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:18.266
<v Interviewer>Yes I've noticed a lot of that,</v>

417
00:19:18.266 --> 00:19:19.745
especially because we have access

418
00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:21.665
to so many people like yourself,

419
00:19:21.665 --> 00:19:24.085
and I start hearing common themes emerging

420
00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:26.065
at various times where someone says,

421
00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:27.605
I'm starting this new book on this,

422
00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:28.945
and three other people have said

423
00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.365
they're starting the same book.

424
00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:32.045
So I know you mean these themes are emerging

425
00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.965
at the time when they need to be addressed.

426
00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:38.885
<v ->Yes, absolutely, and so part of that, is that,</v>

427
00:19:38.885 --> 00:19:41.665
the other part of that I think has to do

428
00:19:41.665 --> 00:19:45.565
with the internet as well, where there are now

429
00:19:45.565 --> 00:19:47.625
virtual teams, there are, you know,

430
00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:50.905
people are coming together, not even for ego benefit,

431
00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:52.725
they don't even care if they get the recognition,

432
00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:55.465
they're just having fun, contributing what they know

433
00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:57.285
to a project, and then they finish it,

434
00:19:57.285 --> 00:19:58.625
they go on to another project,

435
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.365
and they all converge in another virtual team, you know,

436
00:20:01.365 --> 00:20:03.505
and it's so fluid.

437
00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:07.255
And the ego thing that is not so important.

438
00:20:07.865 --> 00:20:09.465
So I think that we're gonna see

439
00:20:09.465 --> 00:20:11.785
a lot of symptoms of this change

440
00:20:11.785 --> 00:20:16.185
like reality TV and celebrities,

441
00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:21.005
and the criteria that people used to think,

442
00:20:21.005 --> 00:20:24.105
why someones should be looked at, you know,

443
00:20:24.105 --> 00:20:29.105
that stupid, you know, self centered, nasty,

444
00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:32.676
sarcastic people, who wants to look at that anymore?

445
00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:35.027
You know, where as I think, character is gonna

446
00:20:35.027 --> 00:20:40.027
start to come back in now as something enviable,

447
00:20:40.787 --> 00:20:43.776
something that people want to copy and model.

448
00:20:44.146 --> 00:20:45.906
<v Interviewer>Interestingly Gerald Celente</v>

449
00:20:45.906 --> 00:20:49.386
who is the trend caster for, the future trends,

450
00:20:49.386 --> 00:20:52.011
you see him on everywhere, first to the air is on Fox.

451
00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:54.475
He's on everywhere, he's had some good predictions.

452
00:20:54.475 --> 00:20:56.995
But one thing he was saying was that,

453
00:20:56.995 --> 00:20:59.735
with this decline of the economic system

454
00:20:59.735 --> 00:21:01.956
and the political systems and such that

455
00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.376
he was saying a couple of years ago

456
00:21:03.376 --> 00:21:05.855
which should start really taking hold in 2012,

457
00:21:05.855 --> 00:21:08.855
is a re-emergence of a sense of elegance,

458
00:21:10.065 --> 00:21:12.075
and what you're just saying, character.

459
00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:16.856
<v ->Yes, yeah, slower rhythm, because</v>

460
00:21:16.856 --> 00:21:19.615
in order for the intuition age to happen,

461
00:21:19.615 --> 00:21:24.565
people have to be able to get quiet and go inside.

462
00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:27.835
In order to recreate the outside world,

463
00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:29.856
they have to go into the inner blueprint,

464
00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:31.556
you know, into the energy world,

465
00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:35.235
in order to change the physical world through imagination.

466
00:21:35.235 --> 00:21:37.175
And if you're texting all the time,

467
00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:39.915
you're not in any realm, you know,

468
00:21:39.915 --> 00:21:43.615
you're not really activating anything intuitive.

469
00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:44.455
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

470
00:21:44.455 --> 00:21:46.155
<v ->And so I think that there's gonna be something</v>

471
00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:48.415
that happens that causes people to

472
00:21:48.415 --> 00:21:53.415
suddenly want more slower, quieter,

473
00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:56.937
thoughtful kinds of things,

474
00:21:56.937 --> 00:21:58.497
I'm not sure how it's gonna happen yet.

475
00:21:58.497 --> 00:21:59.478
<v Interviewer>Yes, it's almost like there has to be</v>

476
00:21:59.478 --> 00:22:00.997
some kind of blowout of the senses

477
00:22:00.997 --> 00:22:02.697
or the grid has to go down for enough time

478
00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:04.637
for people to understand what it feels like

479
00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:06.758
to have that kind of quiet field around them

480
00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:09.308
which right now, it's so much over saturation.

481
00:22:09.778 --> 00:22:11.688
And do you notice that there is that

482
00:22:11.688 --> 00:22:14.038
because you also, besides being an author,

483
00:22:14.038 --> 00:22:17.018
you take a little time to still do readings for individuals.

484
00:22:17.018 --> 00:22:19.698
Do you notice any specific treands

485
00:22:19.698 --> 00:22:21.538
besides this stuck thing?

486
00:22:21.538 --> 00:22:23.098
I mean I would think generationally,

487
00:22:23.098 --> 00:22:24.598
the people that have had the old way

488
00:22:24.598 --> 00:22:26.678
of being going for a long time, are much more

489
00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.878
resistant than the younger ones for one.

490
00:22:30.338 --> 00:22:32.688
<v ->Those people don't come for readings</v>

491
00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:36.838
but the ones who come are very aware

492
00:22:36.838 --> 00:22:40.738
that this new thing is happening, they want it.

493
00:22:40.738 --> 00:22:42.948
It's like they are in a doorway,

494
00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:45.058
and you lean back the old way and you go,

495
00:22:45.058 --> 00:22:46.498
I don't wanna go back there.

496
00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:50.018
It's too slow, it's too sticky, I don't like it back there

497
00:22:50.018 --> 00:22:52.158
but this way, I wanna go but I can't see

498
00:22:52.158 --> 00:22:54.438
how it's gonna be yet, and I'm a little afraid

499
00:22:54.438 --> 00:22:56.238
to step through cause what it'll be like.

500
00:22:56.238 --> 00:22:59.609
So they feel stuck because they're in that doorway.

501
00:23:00.098 --> 00:23:03.178
And partly what I'm trying to do with people

502
00:23:03.178 --> 00:23:06.849
is to show them a vision of their destiny.

503
00:23:07.198 --> 00:23:10.038
You know, of like, who are you deeply down?

504
00:23:10.038 --> 00:23:11.598
What is trying to come through?

505
00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:12.778
And what might it look like?

506
00:23:12.778 --> 00:23:14.188
And how might it happen?

507
00:23:14.458 --> 00:23:16.928
You know, it's still gonna happen it time and space,

508
00:23:17.218 --> 00:23:19.028
but it could happen much faster,

509
00:23:19.578 --> 00:23:22.758
and much more easily, but the imagination

510
00:23:22.758 --> 00:23:24.538
has to come into gear.

511
00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:27.858
So a lot of what is happening is that people's left brain

512
00:23:27.858 --> 00:23:31.138
wants to just project them right away into the new work

513
00:23:31.138 --> 00:23:32.838
or the new thing, the new form.

514
00:23:32.838 --> 00:23:34.038
<v Interviewer>Right, with a hiccup.</v>

515
00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:36.218
<v ->Without a hiccup, they wanna go from form to form,</v>

516
00:23:36.218 --> 00:23:38.268
and nothing in-between.

517
00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:40.258
What has to happen is that they

518
00:23:40.258 --> 00:23:43.550
have to stop the old way, rest,

519
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.230
let adjustation happen.

520
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.820
And start to open imagination, so that they

521
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.060
can get all those huge big ideas

522
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.810
that are just right for them.

523
00:23:54.821 --> 00:23:57.281
And then let them drop in, let the new vision

524
00:23:57.281 --> 00:24:01.330
almost start to occur atheorically in the aura,

525
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.880
you know, it's like the new thing will start

526
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.851
consolidating around you.

527
00:24:08.161 --> 00:24:08.861
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

528
00:24:08.861 --> 00:24:10.731
<v ->But it's in the energy world first,</v>

529
00:24:10.841 --> 00:24:13.401
then it starts to show up in the solid world,

530
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:15.280
and low and behold, I'm in my new job,

531
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.541
how did I get here?

532
00:24:16.541 --> 00:24:20.701
You know, but so this process of working

533
00:24:20.701 --> 00:24:24.221
from consciousness and energy,

534
00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:26.121
and the inner world to the outer world,

535
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.521
is really really important today,

536
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:31.181
and that people hold themselves

537
00:24:31.181 --> 00:24:35.661
in their home frequency or their soul in the body state,

538
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:38.421
while they're doing that, so that they can get

539
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:41.360
the right frequency of ideas for their new self

540
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.810
and their new life.

541
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.420
Otherwise, they're creating of of an old memory

542
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.330
which isn't accurate.

543
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.420
<v Interviewer>And when you're saying this,</v>

544
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.560
of course the big block for most people is,

545
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.720
okay I'm doing this, it's not working for me anymore,

546
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.160
or maybe it's gone away.

547
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.602
I need to get something quickly

548
00:24:58.602 --> 00:24:59.842
because I have to pay the bills.

549
00:24:59.842 --> 00:25:00.602
<v ->Right.</v>

550
00:25:00.602 --> 00:25:02.221
<v Interviewer>So it seems that the money factor</v>

551
00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:04.101
is the biggest obstacle and fear factor

552
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:06.502
when it comes to unleashing creativity.

553
00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:08.282
So when a person is in that situation

554
00:25:08.282 --> 00:25:10.986
and has maybe only one, money enough

555
00:25:10.986 --> 00:25:13.826
for one or two months of getting through

556
00:25:13.826 --> 00:25:16.726
the next round of bills, how do you

557
00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:19.445
work with them on that, or is it just that

558
00:25:19.445 --> 00:25:20.706
the same principles apply,

559
00:25:20.706 --> 00:25:22.405
you just have to deal with it?

560
00:25:22.405 --> 00:25:23.985
<v ->The same principle applies.</v>

561
00:25:23.985 --> 00:25:27.765
You go into the present moment, because that's

562
00:25:27.765 --> 00:25:30.156
where imagination and intuition live.

563
00:25:30.726 --> 00:25:33.266
You see that fear is coming from the left brain

564
00:25:33.266 --> 00:25:35.086
projecting things from the past

565
00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:38.316
and other people's ideas of fear on to the future,

566
00:25:38.446 --> 00:25:40.426
and then you just block off your intuition

567
00:25:40.426 --> 00:25:44.476
and imagination, and creativity in the present moment,

568
00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:46.346
which is where anything can happen.

569
00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:49.846
So you have to discipline your mind enough,

570
00:25:49.846 --> 00:25:52.666
that you just stop looking at the fact-based world

571
00:25:52.666 --> 00:25:54.916
as the creative place.

572
00:25:55.326 --> 00:25:58.366
It's what you created already from previous thoughts,

573
00:25:58.366 --> 00:26:02.236
it's what you've already received, it's old.

574
00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:06.126
You know, and so what's new is dropping,

575
00:26:06.126 --> 00:26:09.355
just get quiet, okay what do I wanna do?

576
00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:11.495
So what if I have two months worth,

577
00:26:11.495 --> 00:26:14.456
that doesn't matter, that's fact-based world, right?

578
00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:17.546
So instead you go into what could be,

579
00:26:17.546 --> 00:26:18.866
what would be fun.

580
00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:20.526
Alright, well what's the first step towards

581
00:26:20.526 --> 00:26:24.176
that fun that would be interesting?

582
00:26:24.286 --> 00:26:26.676
How could I combine two of my interests?

583
00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:30.516
I often recommend people have an idea journal now,

584
00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:34.406
where they just jot down things like,

585
00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:35.826
there's always something happening

586
00:26:35.826 --> 00:26:38.566
in that under consciousness right below

587
00:26:38.566 --> 00:26:39.806
the surface of your mind,

588
00:26:39.806 --> 00:26:42.026
your inner conversations and stuff,

589
00:26:42.026 --> 00:26:43.746
what are those ideas?

590
00:26:43.746 --> 00:26:45.246
You know, jot those down, and then

591
00:26:45.246 --> 00:26:47.436
go back later and look at all of them and see.

592
00:26:47.746 --> 00:26:49.586
Are they, what would happen if you put

593
00:26:49.586 --> 00:26:51.546
two or three of those together and had a job

594
00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:53.706
that allowed you to do those three things,

595
00:26:53.706 --> 00:26:55.286
what would that job be?

596
00:26:55.286 --> 00:26:57.046
<v Interviewer>And this is, the thing is</v>

597
00:26:57.046 --> 00:26:59.986
creating your own reality, creating your own job.

598
00:26:59.986 --> 00:27:01.406
They may not be a job out there

599
00:27:01.406 --> 00:27:03.146
that you're going to find on Craigslist

600
00:27:03.146 --> 00:27:05.306
that's offering this thing that you're looking for.

601
00:27:05.306 --> 00:27:07.646
This really, these times require a good deal

602
00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:09.286
of courage for people.

603
00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:13.976
<v ->Right, yeah, and it's all about present moment,</v>

604
00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:17.516
because time is speeding up,

605
00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:19.906
and what's really happening is everything

606
00:27:19.906 --> 00:27:22.106
is coming into the present moment.

607
00:27:22.106 --> 00:27:25.091
So things don't take time to happen,

608
00:27:25.091 --> 00:27:28.472
you don't project something, oh it'll happen in the future,

609
00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:34.403
or a, b, c, d, e, it's in the moment with you now,

610
00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:37.053
but as a higher potential of this moment.

611
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.540
Think of it as a ball, like an onion, you know,

612
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.620
like okay, we're in this part of the onion right now

613
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.819
but the layers go out, it's still your present moment,

614
00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:48.470
but it's a higher frequency, each layer.

615
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.200
So your, what used to be the future,

616
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.790
is a potential of your present moment.

617
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.700
Now if you can get your consciousness

618
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.620
and energy to that higher frequency,

619
00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.240
you have it right now, you know

620
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.450
it will come in very fast.

621
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.160
<v Interviewer>Would you kind of give a couple of examples</v>

622
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.070
of people who found themselves in this exact situation.

623
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.480
The old wasn't working anymore,

624
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.640
they did manage to connect with their creativity

625
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.960
again to be able to dream into what they really wanted,

626
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.920
and then manifest in this way.

627
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.458
It doesn't even pop to mind.

628
00:28:19.458 --> 00:28:21.240
<v ->Well my publisher pops to mind</v>

629
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.900
because they had quite a bit of difficulty

630
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.800
during the crash in 9/11 and all of that period,

631
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.990
and we're having terrible financial problems.

632
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.310
And is a husband and wife, and finally

633
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.481
and they were just a nervous wreck,

634
00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:42.081
you know, and couldn't pay royalties

635
00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:45.562
and we're just, everybody is mad at them, you know.

636
00:28:45.562 --> 00:28:48.002
So finally, she just said, you know what?

637
00:28:48.002 --> 00:28:51.619
I'm just gonna stop worrying, it is not doing me any good.

638
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:53.949
And he said, I agree, let's just stop worrying

639
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:56.618
and let's do what we can do and relax.

640
00:28:57.248 --> 00:28:59.428
And somehow that shifted things for them

641
00:28:59.428 --> 00:29:02.788
and her intuition opened back up

642
00:29:02.788 --> 00:29:05.208
and she got, I think What, The Bleep,

643
00:29:05.828 --> 00:29:07.390
and then got The Secret.

644
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.660
And what started happening was,

645
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.371
everything just turned around,

646
00:29:12.461 --> 00:29:13.966
almost like by magic when they

647
00:29:13.966 --> 00:29:15.756
changed their vibration.

648
00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:16.446
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

649
00:29:16.446 --> 00:29:19.326
<v ->And then it just skyrocketed, you know,</v>

650
00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:21.867
so and they've stayed that way, you know,

651
00:29:21.867 --> 00:29:23.617
and gotten a lot of good

652
00:29:26.527 --> 00:29:29.218
evolutionally oriented books, I would say.

653
00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:32.128
<v Interviewer>That's so true though, I mean every person</v>

654
00:29:32.128 --> 00:29:34.450
that's listening right now or watching this right now,

655
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.388
can feel that when you go into fear,

656
00:29:36.388 --> 00:29:37.948
and we talked about this earlier,

657
00:29:37.948 --> 00:29:40.008
the entire field starts shutting down

658
00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:41.868
and restricting, constricting.

659
00:29:41.868 --> 00:29:43.608
<v ->Well energy can't flow because you're</v>

660
00:29:43.608 --> 00:29:45.278
thinking about what isn't.

661
00:29:45.928 --> 00:29:48.198
You're thinking about what might not happen.

662
00:29:48.788 --> 00:29:50.728
And you're actually almost holding your breath

663
00:29:50.728 --> 00:29:53.078
and holding all the energy in.

664
00:29:53.928 --> 00:29:57.049
And there are ways, I call them soul blockers,

665
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:58.529
you know there ways of thinking

666
00:29:58.529 --> 00:30:01.159
that prevent the flow of energy,

667
00:30:01.829 --> 00:30:05.499
and fear in every form does that.

668
00:30:06.309 --> 00:30:09.119
Or you know, protesting ignorance, oh I don't know,

669
00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:11.239
people say, oh I don't know,

670
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:14.599
well, you know, that's blocking.

671
00:30:14.869 --> 00:30:16.049
<v Interviewer>And as you say in your book,</v>

672
00:30:16.049 --> 00:30:18.850
this attachment to phases in life that we have.

673
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.550
<v ->Yeah.</v>

674
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.930
<v Interviewer>We become attached,</v>

675
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.270
no it's been going pretty well, I don't want it end,

676
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.190
and so, and then it ends, right?

677
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.270
And as you said, and you said earlier

678
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.672
everything is an ebb and flow.

679
00:30:28.672 --> 00:30:30.532
There is a time for extreme activity,

680
00:30:30.532 --> 00:30:32.512
there is a time to stop and to reflect,

681
00:30:32.512 --> 00:30:35.012
and to you know, re-imagine again,

682
00:30:35.012 --> 00:30:36.372
use the imagination again.

683
00:30:36.372 --> 00:30:38.812
<v ->Well part of it, the flow we think of as linear,</v>

684
00:30:38.812 --> 00:30:42.768
like its's going like a sine wave forward towards something.

685
00:30:42.768 --> 00:30:45.708
But the new model is, it's not actually going anywhere,

686
00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:47.388
you're in the center of the present moment

687
00:30:47.388 --> 00:30:50.408
and you'll always will be, and it's just about vibration

688
00:30:50.408 --> 00:30:52.648
and what you're creating in the ball around you,

689
00:30:52.648 --> 00:30:55.318
it's like a three dimensional spherical movie.

690
00:30:56.168 --> 00:30:58.859
So the higher your frequency, the more fun you're moving.

691
00:30:59.949 --> 00:31:04.599
So the flow, I think it's very much related to Physics

692
00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:06.948
where you have the particle-based reality

693
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:10.308
which is physical, and then every other millisecond

694
00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:13.438
you know, it kind of oscillates out and becomes the wave.

695
00:31:14.088 --> 00:31:17.878
And goes into what Physics calls The Many Worlds Theory,

696
00:31:18.108 --> 00:31:20.548
where everything is there, it's all possible,

697
00:31:20.548 --> 00:31:23.499
nothing is in form yet.

698
00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:26.758
And that's every other second, you know,

699
00:31:26.828 --> 00:31:30.438
we go back into the all world possibilities you know.

700
00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:33.689
Then we choose one, somehow unconsciously,

701
00:31:33.689 --> 00:31:36.539
and we come back to the one we just knew.

702
00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:39.519
And so we seem like we have continuity,

703
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:42.029
and maybe we do for a while

704
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:44.678
as long as the soul wants this thing to happen.

705
00:31:44.968 --> 00:31:48.108
But we could have very different realities show up

706
00:31:48.108 --> 00:31:49.788
if we wanted something different.

707
00:31:49.788 --> 00:31:51.329
We could be shape-shifters you know.

708
00:31:51.329 --> 00:31:53.315
So you could go out, and then choose

709
00:31:53.315 --> 00:31:55.275
to come back in somewhere else, you know,

710
00:31:55.275 --> 00:31:57.395
or look different or not aged,

711
00:31:57.395 --> 00:31:59.575
or whatever you'd like to do.

712
00:31:59.575 --> 00:32:02.855
So that we have that momentary choice

713
00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:07.055
about manifesting of a particle-based world

714
00:32:07.055 --> 00:32:10.118
every second or so you know like--

715
00:32:10.118 --> 00:32:11.498
<v Interviewer>We don't have to go for 20 years</v>

716
00:32:11.498 --> 00:32:13.997
and a gold watch in something we don't enjoy doing.

717
00:32:13.997 --> 00:32:14.757
<v ->Exactly.</v>

718
00:32:14.757 --> 00:32:15.974
<v Interviewer>I mean the timing for that</v>

719
00:32:15.974 --> 00:32:17.395
sounds to me, it's really over.

720
00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:17.895
<v ->It is.</v>

721
00:32:17.895 --> 00:32:19.775
<v Interviewer>Because the structures that supported it</v>

722
00:32:19.775 --> 00:32:21.075
are currently beginning to collapse,

723
00:32:21.075 --> 00:32:22.715
or have collapsed already.

724
00:32:22.715 --> 00:32:25.308
So trying to plug into an old way, it doesn't matter

725
00:32:25.308 --> 00:32:27.508
if you're 50, 60, 70 years old.

726
00:32:27.508 --> 00:32:30.048
We all chose to incarnate it this time

727
00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:32.948
during this rapidly changing frequencies,

728
00:32:32.948 --> 00:32:36.857
so that we could have this playground open to us.

729
00:32:37.988 --> 00:32:42.988
<v ->Yeah, and I think it's such an important time for,</v>

730
00:32:45.688 --> 00:32:47.725
almost like a final phase of evolution

731
00:32:48.315 --> 00:32:51.155
where we have gone through the deep

732
00:32:51.155 --> 00:32:53.595
dark journey into the underworld

733
00:32:53.595 --> 00:32:57.395
and you know, the hero's journey, and we've come out,

734
00:32:57.395 --> 00:32:59.895
like come out of the other end of the karma tunnel,

735
00:32:59.895 --> 00:33:01.155
you know, I'm thinking of.

736
00:33:01.155 --> 00:33:04.055
<v Interviewer>Somewhat in more or less, good or bad shape.</v>

737
00:33:04.055 --> 00:33:07.375
<v ->Right, and just blink blink here I am, you know,</v>

738
00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:09.615
and oh gosh I'm done with that part,

739
00:33:09.615 --> 00:33:13.105
okay now I can do anything I want, okay, yeah.

740
00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:15.095
<v Interviewer>Yeah, and I see that as,</v>

741
00:33:15.095 --> 00:33:17.675
I see it just as an incredibly exciting period of time

742
00:33:17.675 --> 00:33:20.375
and feel possibilities abounding, I mean.

743
00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:22.835
For me, I feel it, and I feel it in my field everywhere,

744
00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:26.776
and I've viscerally understand what you're saying.

745
00:33:26.776 --> 00:33:28.416
But on a visceral level, let's talk about

746
00:33:28.416 --> 00:33:30.076
some practical things, because ultimately

747
00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:31.696
I wanna get to the home frequency,

748
00:33:31.696 --> 00:33:34.196
and finding our way to the home frequency

749
00:33:34.196 --> 00:33:36.296
and what that means, and the joy component to it.

750
00:33:36.296 --> 00:33:37.601
But in the interim, we're going through

751
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:41.241
a lot of other frequencies, this buzzing,

752
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:45.341
this electrical buzzing in the body and such that,

753
00:33:45.341 --> 00:33:47.682
arelots of people going through

754
00:33:47.682 --> 00:33:50.543
this at this time, and what do you know,

755
00:33:50.543 --> 00:33:52.163
how are you describing that?

756
00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.723
When you look at people and readings

757
00:33:53.723 --> 00:33:56.404
and you're looking at their aura and their body,

758
00:33:56.404 --> 00:33:58.263
what are you seeing with that?

759
00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:02.874
<v ->It's, a lot of it is their attitude toward it, you know.</v>

760
00:34:04.124 --> 00:34:09.124
If you resist it, it gets even more, what would you call it,

761
00:34:09.264 --> 00:34:12.203
like a buzz saw, like rough, you know.

762
00:34:12.203 --> 00:34:14.591
Often I have this sense that people

763
00:34:14.591 --> 00:34:17.591
who are living with high anxiety, emotional anxiety,

764
00:34:17.591 --> 00:34:19.851
have the sense of the energies going out

765
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:21.931
and they they say, oh no I can't really

766
00:34:21.931 --> 00:34:24.391
express myself freely, pull it back in.

767
00:34:24.391 --> 00:34:26.313
Then it wants to go out again,

768
00:34:26.313 --> 00:34:27.873
then they put back in again,

769
00:34:27.873 --> 00:34:28.872
and then it wants to go out again,

770
00:34:28.872 --> 00:34:29.913
and then they put back in again,

771
00:34:29.913 --> 00:34:33.172
and there is the sense of this very rough,

772
00:34:33.172 --> 00:34:36.693
hard oscillation in the body which then

773
00:34:36.693 --> 00:34:41.033
that buzz seems to sort of exaggerate that.

774
00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:42.363
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

775
00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:45.153
<v ->If you start to give yourself permission</v>

776
00:34:45.153 --> 00:34:47.053
to be anyway that you want,

777
00:34:47.053 --> 00:34:50.353
to feel anything and everything that's possible to feel,

778
00:34:50.353 --> 00:34:53.693
and you're entitling yourself to feelings,

779
00:34:53.693 --> 00:34:56.673
and to movement, and to self-expression,

780
00:34:56.673 --> 00:34:59.813
then it releases and moves through you.

781
00:34:59.813 --> 00:35:01.574
And the more it moves through you

782
00:35:01.574 --> 00:35:03.614
and you go into movement around it,

783
00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:07.143
or self-expression or creativity, it gets very refined.

784
00:35:08.574 --> 00:35:11.956
It's the holding it back that makes it jangly.

785
00:35:11.956 --> 00:35:13.536
<v Interviewer>And rough for a person, okay.</v>

786
00:35:13.536 --> 00:35:15.798
<v ->So the more you release it and then say,</v>

787
00:35:15.798 --> 00:35:18.278
okay this is great, okay, okay, you know,

788
00:35:18.278 --> 00:35:22.638
then it gets more like, oh now the creativity is coming in,

789
00:35:22.638 --> 00:35:24.758
oh now I'm getting better ideas,

790
00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:27.448
and it starts to evolve, you know.

791
00:35:27.818 --> 00:35:31.578
So if you'd trust it, it'll turn into

792
00:35:31.578 --> 00:35:33.068
something really great.

793
00:35:33.378 --> 00:35:34.758
<v Interviewer>Now have you noticed that</v>

794
00:35:34.758 --> 00:35:38.658
just as of late, maybe in the last few weeks for example,

795
00:35:38.658 --> 00:35:40.318
there seems to be a ratcheting up of.

796
00:35:40.318 --> 00:35:42.639
Okay, how are you experiencing this,

797
00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:43.279
what do you see?

798
00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:44.919
<v ->Oh I haven't, two nights ago I didn't</v>

799
00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:46.219
sleep at all, all night.

800
00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:48.919
And when I used to have these,

801
00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:52.059
and it comes in waves I think these insomnia waves

802
00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:55.429
where it activates my mind.

803
00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:58.139
The buzz makes my mind go fast,

804
00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:00.119
and then I can't quite drop,

805
00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:03.009
so I used to get so upset about it.

806
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.839
And now I just like, whatever, just go

807
00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:11.579
okay I'm awake, and so I'll just, you know,

808
00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:13.719
try to control my thoughts so I don't go into

809
00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:16.730
tape loops and those kind of things.

810
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.880
And I'll just let it, you know, pass through

811
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.552
as soon as I get up, and then I don't

812
00:36:23.552 --> 00:36:26.032
try to make the insomnia into a terrible

813
00:36:26.032 --> 00:36:27.613
thing for the next day, and then I find,

814
00:36:27.613 --> 00:36:29.212
well so what, I 'm fine.

815
00:36:29.212 --> 00:36:29.992
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

816
00:36:29.992 --> 00:36:31.252
<v ->I'm not even that tired.</v>

817
00:36:31.252 --> 00:36:33.193
<v Interviewer>Because you have this excess energy</v>

818
00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:35.394
in the body, obviously, or it wouldn't have kept you awake.

819
00:36:35.394 --> 00:36:36.714
<v ->But the left brain is trying to tell me,</v>

820
00:36:36.714 --> 00:36:38.234
you're gonna be really tired tomorrow,

821
00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:39.534
and you're not gonna feel very good,

822
00:36:39.534 --> 00:36:41.027
you'll probably have to go to sleep early

823
00:36:41.027 --> 00:36:43.023
and then I get, no I'm just fine.

824
00:36:43.023 --> 00:36:44.113
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

825
00:36:44.283 --> 00:36:46.183
<v ->So a lot of it is attitude.</v>

826
00:36:46.183 --> 00:36:49.263
And I think that one of the things I'm seeing a lot

827
00:36:49.263 --> 00:36:52.275
is the power of speech,

828
00:36:53.485 --> 00:36:57.815
and the inner speech and the outer speech, you know.

829
00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:00.225
And so there is always those tape loops

830
00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:02.125
you're going through inside you mind

831
00:37:02.125 --> 00:37:04.045
where you're complaining about somebody

832
00:37:04.045 --> 00:37:06.765
or your speech is often negative, you know,

833
00:37:06.765 --> 00:37:08.985
and talking about what won't happen

834
00:37:08.985 --> 00:37:11.045
and how it's not gonna work, you know.

835
00:37:11.045 --> 00:37:15.445
Then you can cement that by saying it out loud.

836
00:37:15.445 --> 00:37:19.465
And I noticed a lot right now, when people start,

837
00:37:19.465 --> 00:37:21.345
when I do a session for people say,

838
00:37:21.345 --> 00:37:22.904
well I'm not doing this, and I can't do this,

839
00:37:22.904 --> 00:37:24.225
and I've lost my job, and I haven't,

840
00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:25.404
and they give me all the negative

841
00:37:25.404 --> 00:37:30.404
declaring of statements about their beliefs basically.

842
00:37:31.244 --> 00:37:32.984
And I say, well the first thing is

843
00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:34.774
we have to turn those around.

844
00:37:35.284 --> 00:37:37.225
They actually don't mean anything.

845
00:37:37.225 --> 00:37:38.635
So, you've lost your job,

846
00:37:38.635 --> 00:37:40.495
but really you're ready for a new job.

847
00:37:41.705 --> 00:37:44.644
People complain at the end of a cycle of creativity

848
00:37:44.644 --> 00:37:47.824
when it's finished, and then they think it's wrong.

849
00:37:47.824 --> 00:37:49.094
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

850
00:37:49.124 --> 00:37:51.064
<v ->And they just did what they wanted to do</v>

851
00:37:51.064 --> 00:37:52.344
and they finished it, you know.

852
00:37:52.344 --> 00:37:54.624
So now, hey thank you for letting me

853
00:37:54.624 --> 00:37:55.864
have that job.

854
00:37:55.864 --> 00:37:58.044
This is really interesting, I learned a lot,

855
00:37:58.044 --> 00:38:00.645
and now, I'm really ready for a new cycle

856
00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:03.625
of creativity you know, and so what do I wanna do now?

857
00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:05.045
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

858
00:38:05.045 --> 00:38:06.985
<v ->Open again, you know, and so</v>

859
00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:09.164
say the truth about where you are

860
00:38:09.164 --> 00:38:13.895
in the cycle of growth and change your statements,

861
00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:17.485
so that you're saying things in a way

862
00:38:17.485 --> 00:38:20.895
that allows energy flow, you know.

863
00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:22.866
So people say, oh I'm, I don't,

864
00:38:22.866 --> 00:38:24.427
I'm afraid of public speaking.

865
00:38:26.299 --> 00:38:28.439
And I say, well, maybe you could say,

866
00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:31.800
I'm not familiar with public speaking,

867
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.400
but it could be interesting.

868
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.180
What I might learn by doing it,

869
00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.700
I might find it really pretty fascinating.

870
00:38:38.601 --> 00:38:40.442
Doesn't mean you have to propel yourself out

871
00:38:40.442 --> 00:38:42.822
to make yourself willfully go into public speaking,

872
00:38:42.822 --> 00:38:46.012
but you open that doorway for the energy

873
00:38:46.012 --> 00:38:48.642
to start flowing into that possible area.

874
00:38:48.653 --> 00:38:49.883
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

875
00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:51.114
<v Interviewer>And what about,</v>

876
00:38:51.114 --> 00:38:52.814
okay you're bringing up something else

877
00:38:52.814 --> 00:38:56.474
that just tripped something in my mind.

878
00:38:57.274 --> 00:38:59.459
This notion, and I'm going back to,

879
00:38:59.459 --> 00:39:01.019
because of the fear around money

880
00:39:01.019 --> 00:39:05.660
for so many people is, we have a perception of it

881
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.779
that you have to have a certain amount of it,

882
00:39:07.779 --> 00:39:09.979
that you have to stockpile it,

883
00:39:09.979 --> 00:39:13.359
that you have to save for a rainy day,

884
00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:14.879
or a retirement and so forth.

885
00:39:14.879 --> 00:39:16.999
But when you're talking about moving

886
00:39:16.999 --> 00:39:20.580
into this state of now, where you're in connection

887
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.040
with the true self, the true self doesn't have

888
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.660
any consideration or need for any of those things

889
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.479
because it's always creating in the moment.

890
00:39:27.479 --> 00:39:30.359
So might we need to also really start letting go

891
00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:34.219
of what it means, what security means, the whole.

892
00:39:34.859 --> 00:39:36.899
<v ->That's a good point, yeah.</v>

893
00:39:37.783 --> 00:39:40.523
I think we have to re-examine a lot of these words

894
00:39:40.523 --> 00:39:43.313
like security, and what it means.

895
00:39:43.523 --> 00:39:48.413
I think that there is a respectful way

896
00:39:48.504 --> 00:39:51.533
to engage in the physical dimension,

897
00:39:51.963 --> 00:39:54.963
and there certainly are still realities that are true

898
00:39:54.963 --> 00:39:59.963
because of mass agreement about the way things work.

899
00:40:01.283 --> 00:40:04.163
And then for a lot time, you know,

900
00:40:04.163 --> 00:40:07.033
that will be true for people.

901
00:40:08.403 --> 00:40:10.083
You can start to shift it though,

902
00:40:10.083 --> 00:40:12.813
and so I don't think you have to stockpile,

903
00:40:13.264 --> 00:40:15.763
but you may find that you open up

904
00:40:15.763 --> 00:40:18.483
and suddenly more financial flow comes in,

905
00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:22.013
and you end saving by not thinking you have to save,

906
00:40:22.543 --> 00:40:24.773
that you have resources or reserves.

907
00:40:25.063 --> 00:40:28.263
And so you put it to work or you create more with it

908
00:40:28.263 --> 00:40:29.806
or whatever, you know.

909
00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:30.666
<v Interviewer>It makes sense that,</v>

910
00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:32.266
if you're in some kind of flow,

911
00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:34.706
you're going to create exactly what you need at that time.

912
00:40:34.706 --> 00:40:37.186
<v ->Or maybe it is that you decide that you wanna live</v>

913
00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:39.967
more in a communal way with other people.

914
00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:42.227
When this convening thins starts coming,

915
00:40:42.227 --> 00:40:44.507
and you start creating a community of sorts,

916
00:40:44.507 --> 00:40:46.527
and that helps with it, you know,

917
00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:48.763
or it could be any sort of solution,

918
00:40:48.763 --> 00:40:51.042
and there are gonna be lots of solutions.

919
00:40:51.042 --> 00:40:52.002
<v Interviewer>Let us stop telling ourselves</v>

920
00:40:52.002 --> 00:40:55.062
the same old stories, oh if I don't have 50,000 dollars

921
00:40:55.062 --> 00:40:56.643
in the bank, I'm not secure,

922
00:40:56.643 --> 00:40:59.022
I can't use my savings account to make my dream happen,

923
00:40:59.022 --> 00:41:01.242
no no, I need to go get another job now,

924
00:41:01.242 --> 00:41:02.882
so I don't have to deplete my savings.

925
00:41:02.882 --> 00:41:05.303
Well, that is real, I'm seeing that

926
00:41:05.303 --> 00:41:06.342
hang some friends of mine,

927
00:41:06.342 --> 00:41:08.586
I'm seeing that hang them up, they don't wanna deplete,

928
00:41:08.586 --> 00:41:09.986
they don't wanna depend on their savings

929
00:41:09.986 --> 00:41:11.329
cause that's their security blanket.

930
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:13.329
So they're trying to go back in the old ways

931
00:41:13.329 --> 00:41:14.889
of being employed that didn't serve

932
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:15.969
them to begin with.

933
00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:19.971
<v ->Yeah, and I think that entrepreneurial energy</v>

934
00:41:19.971 --> 00:41:23.071
is gonna become very prevalent this year,

935
00:41:23.071 --> 00:41:25.842
and from now on, it's part of the innovation energy.

936
00:41:26.592 --> 00:41:29.572
But that, you know, so you're starting an new

937
00:41:29.572 --> 00:41:33.123
part of your life, well you're an entrepreneur again.

938
00:41:33.192 --> 00:41:36.353
You know, so you don't have to save, use your savings.

939
00:41:36.353 --> 00:41:40.333
Get investors, go and you know, drum up business

940
00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:43.243
like you would have had to know when you were 20.

941
00:41:43.572 --> 00:41:48.572
You know, start a thing in a logical sense, you know.

942
00:41:49.557 --> 00:41:50.778
<v Interviewer>And that's a much more beautiful world</v>

943
00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:53.018
because you have people expressing

944
00:41:53.018 --> 00:41:55.628
their true joy, their creativity.

945
00:41:55.978 --> 00:41:59.538
<v ->Yeah, and it's an uprising kind of energy</v>

946
00:41:59.538 --> 00:42:01.098
rather than a self-protective,

947
00:42:01.098 --> 00:42:02.678
oh I have to lose everything

948
00:42:02.678 --> 00:42:04.457
in order to have something that I want.

949
00:42:04.457 --> 00:42:05.357
<v Interviewer>Yeah, exactly.</v>

950
00:42:05.357 --> 00:42:07.058
<v ->You see that's the old thought again.</v>

951
00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:09.183
<v Interviewer>But so now let's get into</v>

952
00:42:09.183 --> 00:42:11.423
which is really, I think, central to your book

953
00:42:11.423 --> 00:42:13.943
and your work, which is our being able

954
00:42:13.943 --> 00:42:18.753
to find our own home frequency, as you call it,

955
00:42:19.263 --> 00:42:22.043
and what that is, first explain what that means,

956
00:42:22.043 --> 00:42:24.722
and then if you would give us some little glimpses

957
00:42:24.722 --> 00:42:27.023
into the ways in which we can start

958
00:42:27.023 --> 00:42:30.673
finding our own frequencies, and the value of it.

959
00:42:31.043 --> 00:42:35.303
<v ->Yes, okay, so I think that because we are now</v>

960
00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:37.783
seeing ourselves as energetic beings

961
00:42:37.783 --> 00:42:41.733
that we all are becoming aware of vibration.

962
00:42:41.943 --> 00:42:43.543
Everything has a frequency,

963
00:42:43.543 --> 00:42:45.583
everything vibrates at different levels.

964
00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:50.403
And so the problem as I see it partly is that

965
00:42:50.403 --> 00:42:52.285
we're so used to putting our attention

966
00:42:52.285 --> 00:42:56.045
in the outside world, to look for approval or permission,

967
00:42:56.045 --> 00:42:59.685
or how to be, that we tend to go over

968
00:42:59.685 --> 00:43:01.664
and feel other people's vibrations,

969
00:43:01.664 --> 00:43:05.025
and then we have this tribal urge to match them,

970
00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:07.985
and that's empathy in its positive sense.

971
00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:10.645
But if also, if you're around a lot of victims

972
00:43:10.645 --> 00:43:12.665
or negative and complaining people

973
00:43:12.665 --> 00:43:15.625
or you know this fear-based reality,

974
00:43:15.625 --> 00:43:18.525
you're gonna match that if you're not conscious of it.

975
00:43:18.525 --> 00:43:21.165
Like corporate cultures often, you know,

976
00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:24.364
you can't be very positive in them, you know,

977
00:43:24.364 --> 00:43:26.804
and people feel like their souls are being murdered,

978
00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:28.705
they tell me, you know.

979
00:43:28.705 --> 00:43:32.725
But, so your frequency matching things in the

980
00:43:32.725 --> 00:43:36.155
outside world that are not you true vibration.

981
00:43:36.785 --> 00:43:39.285
And so maybe you'll feel good around some people

982
00:43:39.285 --> 00:43:41.025
and not so good around others, and you're up and down,

983
00:43:41.025 --> 00:43:42.945
and then you know, you're getting tossed around,

984
00:43:42.945 --> 00:43:44.884
and it's very exhausting.

985
00:43:44.884 --> 00:43:46.644
That's when you're looking for identity

986
00:43:46.644 --> 00:43:48.194
in the outside world.

987
00:43:48.464 --> 00:43:50.504
So what I'm saying is, look for identity

988
00:43:50.504 --> 00:43:52.174
in the inside world.

989
00:43:52.424 --> 00:43:55.224
Inside of you, there is a vibration that's been there

990
00:43:55.224 --> 00:43:56.814
since you were a baby.

991
00:43:57.144 --> 00:43:58.605
And if you'd look at a baby's eyes, you know

992
00:43:58.605 --> 00:44:00.524
you see these windows, there's light coming out,

993
00:44:00.524 --> 00:44:05.355
and no left brain, you know, shutting things down.

994
00:44:06.285 --> 00:44:09.745
And if you even study past lives, you'll find,

995
00:44:09.745 --> 00:44:11.305
as I have found somethings,

996
00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:13.905
that similar interest, similar vibration,

997
00:44:13.905 --> 00:44:17.854
similar kind of energies in all the lives.

998
00:44:18.044 --> 00:44:23.044
So that quality of your own soul or self is eternal'

999
00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:29.929
and that, when that comes in, it animates the body

1000
00:44:30.009 --> 00:44:32.059
and your emotions.

1001
00:44:32.268 --> 00:44:34.768
You will feel a certain way about yourself,

1002
00:44:34.768 --> 00:44:37.148
and you'll like yourself, you know,

1003
00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:39.449
for people it's different.

1004
00:44:39.449 --> 00:44:43.687
And for me, I have identified a state

1005
00:44:43.687 --> 00:44:48.687
that's kind of like a cheerful, buttery, yellow,

1006
00:44:48.707 --> 00:44:51.107
fuzzy nice thing, you know.

1007
00:44:51.107 --> 00:44:54.047
And if I can move into cheerfulness,

1008
00:44:54.047 --> 00:44:56.067
if I'm not feeling good,

1009
00:44:56.067 --> 00:44:58.747
even just even mild cheerfulness,

1010
00:44:58.747 --> 00:45:01.387
I'll return to my home frequency.

1011
00:45:01.387 --> 00:45:03.547
And then that can then amplify,

1012
00:45:03.547 --> 00:45:07.287
once I get into that sort of general state

1013
00:45:07.287 --> 00:45:10.558
and it's you know, and then part of the,

1014
00:45:10.558 --> 00:45:14.316
it is an interest in the world and engaging with things

1015
00:45:14.316 --> 00:45:17.696
and not judging things, and flowing with things.

1016
00:45:17.696 --> 00:45:20.756
So for me, that's what it is, but one of my clients

1017
00:45:20.756 --> 00:45:23.456
when I had her look at it, she said

1018
00:45:23.456 --> 00:45:26.475
oh it's kind of like this, and she moved

1019
00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:28.715
and made a figure eight with her hands,

1020
00:45:28.715 --> 00:45:29.995
and she's a dancer.

1021
00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:33.596
And so for her, it was a whole other feeling

1022
00:45:33.596 --> 00:45:35.875
of flow and movement that brought

1023
00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:37.035
her into that state.

1024
00:45:37.035 --> 00:45:39.455
So everybody has their own way

1025
00:45:39.455 --> 00:45:41.716
of sort of feeling good about themselves,

1026
00:45:41.716 --> 00:45:43.596
and it's not ego, it's when you're just

1027
00:45:43.596 --> 00:45:45.235
happy with life, you know.

1028
00:45:45.235 --> 00:45:47.375
<v Interviewer>And you, one term you use in the book</v>

1029
00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:49.435
as you stay with that pleasure.

1030
00:45:49.435 --> 00:45:50.915
<v ->It's deep pleasure.</v>

1031
00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:51.735
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

1032
00:45:51.735 --> 00:45:52.775
<v ->It's that sense of.</v>

1033
00:45:52.775 --> 00:45:53.916
<v Interviewer>And you stay with that.</v>

1034
00:45:53.916 --> 00:45:54.855
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1035
00:45:54.855 --> 00:45:56.535
<v Interviewer>So you have yo feel your way into,</v>

1036
00:45:56.535 --> 00:45:58.455
cause some people have been away

1037
00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.815
form these feelings for a long time.

1038
00:45:59.815 --> 00:46:02.495
You have to feel your way back into that

1039
00:46:02.495 --> 00:46:06.836
which makes you feel lovable, loving,

1040
00:46:06.836 --> 00:46:09.976
open hearted, generous, compassionate.

1041
00:46:09.976 --> 00:46:10.796
<v ->Willing to laugh.</v>

1042
00:46:10.796 --> 00:46:12.635
<v Interviewer>Fun, yeah exactly, fun.</v>

1043
00:46:12.635 --> 00:46:14.535
<v ->Yeah,and they're simple states,</v>

1044
00:46:14.535 --> 00:46:17.115
they're not like pleasure, high pleasure.

1045
00:46:17.115 --> 00:46:22.115
It's not like that, it's sincerity, it's a very high state.

1046
00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:23.296
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

1047
00:46:23.296 --> 00:46:26.216
<v ->You know, and just interesting things.</v>

1048
00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:29.956
So but you'll find your own sort of trigger

1049
00:46:29.956 --> 00:46:33.376
that gets you into that kind of, all is well,

1050
00:46:33.376 --> 00:46:36.196
I'm enjoying things, and what else is there?

1051
00:46:36.196 --> 00:46:39.236
Oh look at this, you know, and enthusiasm and curiosity.

1052
00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:44.816
And then you try to take a little snapshot of that state,

1053
00:46:44.816 --> 00:46:47.836
so that you go, okay that' where I like to feel.

1054
00:46:47.836 --> 00:46:50.636
And then okay, I'm in a negative mood

1055
00:46:50.636 --> 00:46:53.806
that feels that way, my body takes this posture.

1056
00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:56.316
When I feel good, my chest widens up,

1057
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:58.495
my head levels out, I feel even,

1058
00:46:58.495 --> 00:47:03.495
my eyes are open, and I'm much clearer, you know.

1059
00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:06.315
I'm not blocking everything off with these

1060
00:47:06.315 --> 00:47:10.186
rounded postures and self protective postures.

1061
00:47:10.216 --> 00:47:14.666
So it's not that hard of a thing to discover,

1062
00:47:15.456 --> 00:47:17.726
people know what they like.

1063
00:47:18.376 --> 00:47:21.846
So it's just that we have to feel entitled to have it,

1064
00:47:22.316 --> 00:47:23.986
you don't have to be miserable.

1065
00:47:24.376 --> 00:47:26.436
And I think in this new reality that

1066
00:47:26.436 --> 00:47:31.136
self sacrifice is so old and it's not part

1067
00:47:31.136 --> 00:47:33.566
of this reality anymore, it's not noble.

1068
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:35.816
It doesn't work for the flow of everyone

1069
00:47:35.816 --> 00:47:37.816
if one person sacrificing themselves,

1070
00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:39.556
then the energy can't flow through them.

1071
00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:41.736
<v Interviewer>And that includes relationships,</v>

1072
00:47:41.736 --> 00:47:44.176
relationships within the family,

1073
00:47:44.176 --> 00:47:45.936
personal, intimate relationships.

1074
00:47:45.936 --> 00:47:48.496
We have to learn to start viewing

1075
00:47:48.496 --> 00:47:50.916
and accepting each other in a new way, don't we?

1076
00:47:50.916 --> 00:47:51.816
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1077
00:47:51.816 --> 00:47:54.196
<v Interviewer>What are you seeing is really coming up</v>

1078
00:47:54.196 --> 00:47:56.804
in family and also personal relationships?

1079
00:47:57.354 --> 00:48:01.894
<v ->I think people are less tolerant of being abused</v>

1080
00:48:01.894 --> 00:48:05.200
and of waiting for something to get better,

1081
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.970
or trying to fix people, it doesn't work.

1082
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.910
You know this, I think it's, we're becoming

1083
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:17.192
more aware of even the neurosis like narcissism

1084
00:48:17.192 --> 00:48:19.892
and borderline disorder and things where

1085
00:48:21.762 --> 00:48:23.982
there are frozen patterns,

1086
00:48:24.812 --> 00:48:27.082
and the heart is closed and shocked.

1087
00:48:27.672 --> 00:48:30.112
And that we're trying to open communication

1088
00:48:30.112 --> 00:48:32.373
more now, so that the heart can open,

1089
00:48:32.373 --> 00:48:36.033
and we can instate, return to the home frequency

1090
00:48:36.033 --> 00:48:38.143
when things go array.

1091
00:48:38.373 --> 00:48:39.833
Cause certainly in relationships

1092
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:44.144
we mirror each other's frozen places

1093
00:48:44.234 --> 00:48:47.504
let's call it, not even mirror, we share a field.

1094
00:48:48.493 --> 00:48:51.933
And those things that are common in us

1095
00:48:51.933 --> 00:48:54.723
will arise into the field of the relationship.

1096
00:48:55.133 --> 00:48:56.553
<v Interviewer>And because you can't hide</v>

1097
00:48:56.553 --> 00:48:58.233
things that had been suppressed,

1098
00:48:58.233 --> 00:49:00.313
it's a time where this is going to bubbling

1099
00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:02.073
to the surface within in both people.

1100
00:49:02.073 --> 00:49:04.094
<v ->It's not like, you did this to me.</v>

1101
00:49:04.094 --> 00:49:07.176
No, it's like we're, we have these issues.

1102
00:49:07.176 --> 00:49:07.936
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1103
00:49:07.936 --> 00:49:09.356
<v ->Okay let's not have them anymore</v>

1104
00:49:09.356 --> 00:49:11.576
by going back to our home frequency.

1105
00:49:11.576 --> 00:49:13.316
And we can either talk about it,

1106
00:49:13.316 --> 00:49:15.056
but we can choose not to do this,

1107
00:49:15.056 --> 00:49:16.856
and you didn't do it to me.

1108
00:49:16.856 --> 00:49:19.816
Because I have the same thing or we wouldn't be together.

1109
00:49:19.816 --> 00:49:20.935
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1110
00:49:20.935 --> 00:49:22.675
<v ->You know, so let's identify it</v>

1111
00:49:22.675 --> 00:49:24.675
and then just pull the plug on it,

1112
00:49:24.675 --> 00:49:26.236
and not do it anymore.

1113
00:49:26.236 --> 00:49:27.436
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1114
00:49:27.436 --> 00:49:30.616
<v ->A lot of times, I think growth now is a matter</v>

1115
00:49:30.616 --> 00:49:35.616
of not participating in the thing you don't like.

1116
00:49:37.035 --> 00:49:39.455
And it's not a will power thing of suppressing it,

1117
00:49:39.455 --> 00:49:41.476
it's more like a stereo headphone jack

1118
00:49:41.476 --> 00:49:42.996
that you're listening to a certain channels,

1119
00:49:42.996 --> 00:49:45.816
pull it out and then go blank.

1120
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.556
And go give yourself some silence

1121
00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:50.756
so that you can remember your home frequency

1122
00:49:50.756 --> 00:49:53.016
and say, oh wait I know how I like to feel.

1123
00:49:53.016 --> 00:49:55.835
Okay now we'd create that, now I'm back

1124
00:49:55.835 --> 00:49:57.215
to my cheerfulness or whatever,

1125
00:49:57.215 --> 00:50:01.425
and now what do I think about how things are working?

1126
00:50:01.455 --> 00:50:04.196
So you plug back into your own energy.

1127
00:50:04.196 --> 00:50:05.535
<v Interviewer>And that becomes your</v>

1128
00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:06.796
touchstone of truth.

1129
00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:08.196
<v ->It does, and then because everything</v>

1130
00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:10.075
is in the present moment,

1131
00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:13.185
healing can happen instantaneously.

1132
00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:16.635
We do not have to go through long

1133
00:50:16.635 --> 00:50:18.995
therapeutic processes anymore,

1134
00:50:18.995 --> 00:50:20.515
where you go back to the past

1135
00:50:20.515 --> 00:50:22.735
and haul that stuff into the present,

1136
00:50:22.735 --> 00:50:26.265
you know, wrestle with it, you know.

1137
00:50:26.835 --> 00:50:29.326
The minute you unplug it, it loses energy.

1138
00:50:29.575 --> 00:50:30.935
And if you keep unplugging from it

1139
00:50:30.935 --> 00:50:33.875
over and over, it fades out, and becomes

1140
00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:36.795
almost like a vapor, and goes off of you

1141
00:50:36.795 --> 00:50:38.545
back into the unified field.

1142
00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:41.315
You're not holding it and looking at it constantly

1143
00:50:41.315 --> 00:50:44.585
and making it real to yourself, if you let it go.

1144
00:50:45.215 --> 00:50:46.695
Then you have this experiences

1145
00:50:46.695 --> 00:50:49.155
kind of like a strange memory loss,

1146
00:50:49.155 --> 00:50:51.328
it's like, did I ever feel that way?

1147
00:50:51.328 --> 00:50:52.588
Was that mine?

1148
00:50:52.588 --> 00:50:54.088
Or is that somebody that I knew

1149
00:50:54.088 --> 00:50:55.768
that used to feel that way?

1150
00:50:55.768 --> 00:50:58.228
Oh it doesn't matter, you know, and then you go on.

1151
00:50:58.228 --> 00:50:59.288
<v Interviewer>Cause it's not part of you</v>

1152
00:50:59.288 --> 00:51:00.348
or your template anymore.

1153
00:51:00.348 --> 00:51:02.728
<v ->It's universal stuff, you can look at it</v>

1154
00:51:02.728 --> 00:51:06.338
and bring it into reality if you want to, but why?

1155
00:51:06.788 --> 00:51:08.868
<v Interviewer>So once you go to your home state,</v>

1156
00:51:08.868 --> 00:51:12.608
this place where you're feeling you're optimized best,

1157
00:51:12.608 --> 00:51:14.788
so to speak, this is really the place where

1158
00:51:14.788 --> 00:51:16.479
we should be creating from.

1159
00:51:16.479 --> 00:51:20.119
<v ->Yes, and if you will center into it a lot,</v>

1160
00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:22.359
and in early stages you have to saturate with it.

1161
00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:24.859
You have to give your body the message that,

1162
00:51:24.859 --> 00:51:27.200
hey body, this is the way we're vibrating now,

1163
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.940
we're not doing that old thing anymore,

1164
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.400
now we're gonna feel this way.

1165
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.780
<v Interviewer>And your book is really lovely</v>

1166
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.000
at guiding people through that,

1167
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.340
I mean that's the nice thing about the book,

1168
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.040
it's not just an explanation for phenomena.

1169
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.981
You have, oh yeah you have to do it,

1170
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:41.721
you have practices all throughout,

1171
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:43.242
I really appreciate what you've done.

1172
00:51:43.242 --> 00:51:45.753
<v ->I like to make things real, and so.</v>

1173
00:51:45.753 --> 00:51:47.732
<v Interviewer>And so you help people from,</v>

1174
00:51:47.732 --> 00:51:50.052
as you say, saturate into this home frequency.

1175
00:51:50.052 --> 00:51:51.692
<v ->Right, and so you got to achieve</v>

1176
00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:55.652
the saturation where it becomes normal, more normal,

1177
00:51:55.652 --> 00:51:57.892
so that you can return to it easily, you know.

1178
00:51:57.892 --> 00:52:01.232
Then once you have saturated the body,

1179
00:52:01.232 --> 00:52:03.992
then your emotions get saturated in that,

1180
00:52:03.992 --> 00:52:06.632
and you start to feel happier

1181
00:52:06.632 --> 00:52:09.492
or you don't go into bad moods as much,

1182
00:52:09.492 --> 00:52:10.812
then your thoughts saturate with it,

1183
00:52:10.812 --> 00:52:12.696
you get better quality thoughts,

1184
00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:16.696
then your whole field saturates with it.

1185
00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:20.857
And the aura, the environment around you saturates,

1186
00:52:20.857 --> 00:52:24.197
and then what happens is events, opportunities,

1187
00:52:24.197 --> 00:52:27.677
other people start showing up inside your field.

1188
00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:30.078
And they must match that vibration

1189
00:52:30.078 --> 00:52:32.508
in order to show up in the field,

1190
00:52:32.877 --> 00:52:35.438
so you start the whole life changes then.

1191
00:52:35.438 --> 00:52:39.488
So it is a gradual process of sort of saturating everything,

1192
00:52:39.838 --> 00:52:41.648
and then things really work.

1193
00:52:41.778 --> 00:52:42.978
<v Interviewer>There it's very beautiful,</v>

1194
00:52:42.978 --> 00:52:45.777
and then it's very direct, it's very achievable.

1195
00:52:45.777 --> 00:52:48.558
So I just want it, before anyone even starts

1196
00:52:48.558 --> 00:52:49.998
working with in the book, I wanna say

1197
00:52:49.998 --> 00:52:52.897
I find it very, you've done a very effective job with that.

1198
00:52:52.897 --> 00:52:53.797
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1199
00:52:53.797 --> 00:52:56.317
<v Interviewer>And so now let's look at.</v>

1200
00:52:56.317 --> 00:52:59.198
You have some of your own visions into the future

1201
00:52:59.198 --> 00:53:02.538
because that's your job as to your being

1202
00:53:02.538 --> 00:53:05.918
as always reaching out, reaching your field out,

1203
00:53:05.918 --> 00:53:08.633
and touching with the dominant frequencies

1204
00:53:08.633 --> 00:53:13.103
of humanity, universally, other dimensions, and so forth.

1205
00:53:13.533 --> 00:53:16.113
I would like you to share with us your visions

1206
00:53:16.113 --> 00:53:19.473
of what your feeling is going to be evolving

1207
00:53:19.473 --> 00:53:20.753
in our future now.

1208
00:53:21.513 --> 00:53:24.440
<v ->Well, and it's not a set in stone certainly, and</v>

1209
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:29.930
I think that, I mentioned this before already

1210
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.565
that there is this kind of simultaneously

1211
00:53:33.565 --> 00:53:36.445
rising and falling, changing of the guard

1212
00:53:36.445 --> 00:53:41.125
of people's realities, and that will continue for a while

1213
00:53:41.125 --> 00:53:43.075
with a lot of chaos.

1214
00:53:43.385 --> 00:53:46.126
As the old ones have to let go and they don't work

1215
00:53:46.126 --> 00:53:48.605
and the fight, the ego death fight goes on.

1216
00:53:49.585 --> 00:53:52.927
Some people get involved in the fight and resist it,

1217
00:53:52.927 --> 00:53:55.959
and then they're still caught in the duality of all of that.

1218
00:53:56.169 --> 00:53:58.539
So then I think there will be quite a bit of war,

1219
00:53:58.749 --> 00:54:01.049
and actually I've been saying for quite a while

1220
00:54:01.049 --> 00:54:04.618
that I think revolution and rebellion.

1221
00:54:05.048 --> 00:54:07.858
Because the energy is trying to flow through,

1222
00:54:07.908 --> 00:54:10.468
it his his log jams, and it just builds up

1223
00:54:10.468 --> 00:54:13.709
like water behind a dam, cause it's gonna go through.

1224
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:14.519
<v Interviewer>Yep.</v>

1225
00:54:14.519 --> 00:54:16.749
<v ->And it gets to a certain breaking point</v>

1226
00:54:16.749 --> 00:54:18.269
and then boom.

1227
00:54:18.269 --> 00:54:20.569
And you know, so we're seeing, you know

1228
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:22.729
the revolutions politically around the world,

1229
00:54:22.729 --> 00:54:26.309
but I think it's gonna happen more and more.

1230
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:28.728
And that is how I'm not gonna take

1231
00:54:28.728 --> 00:54:30.128
it anymore kind of thing.

1232
00:54:31.529 --> 00:54:32.991
And some people will get involved in that,

1233
00:54:32.991 --> 00:54:35.170
other people will be out of the fray altogether

1234
00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.690
and just being creative.

1235
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.670
And just using the energy, cause it's flowing through them

1236
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.081
and they're not blocked.

1237
00:54:40.511 --> 00:54:44.250
Those people will, like I said, have the innovations,

1238
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.410
there's gonna be amazing new things

1239
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.530
developed very rapidly at the same time

1240
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.450
that these other stuffs happening.

1241
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:56.443
And I think that the more

1242
00:54:58.373 --> 00:55:02.713
the energy can flow through people, the less problems

1243
00:55:02.713 --> 00:55:06.134
we'll have with earth changes, and weather changes

1244
00:55:06.134 --> 00:55:10.074
and areas in the world where those kind of people live,

1245
00:55:10.074 --> 00:55:13.054
will likely not go through as much chaos.

1246
00:55:13.054 --> 00:55:14.874
<v Interviewer>Yes, because we are linked.</v>

1247
00:55:14.874 --> 00:55:16.334
<v ->Because it's all flowing through</v>

1248
00:55:16.334 --> 00:55:18.834
in these geographical areas.

1249
00:55:18.834 --> 00:55:19.674
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

1250
00:55:19.674 --> 00:55:24.043
<v ->And so but it's not all rosy,</v>

1251
00:55:25.313 --> 00:55:29.204
but it's also partly to the, you do create your own reality,

1252
00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:32.264
and you are gonna be where you need to be.

1253
00:55:32.434 --> 00:55:34.434
If you wan to see how courageous you are,

1254
00:55:34.434 --> 00:55:37.034
you could be in the outskirts or involved

1255
00:55:37.034 --> 00:55:38.794
in something like this.

1256
00:55:38.794 --> 00:55:41.334
If you just really wanna work and create

1257
00:55:41.334 --> 00:55:44.694
and help this change accelerate through,

1258
00:55:44.694 --> 00:55:47.954
then you'll be fine, you know, you'll do that.

1259
00:55:47.954 --> 00:55:51.254
I think everybody's reality is up to them.

1260
00:55:51.254 --> 00:55:54.894
I also think that we're going to go through

1261
00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:59.056
a re-examination of what it means to die.

1262
00:55:59.426 --> 00:56:04.426
That as we become more fluid and energy-based,

1263
00:56:04.886 --> 00:56:08.106
the whole idea of death will seem sort of silly,

1264
00:56:08.106 --> 00:56:11.686
like not a big deal, like people who've gone

1265
00:56:11.686 --> 00:56:13.726
through near death experiences and come back,

1266
00:56:13.726 --> 00:56:14.986
say oh it was great.

1267
00:56:14.986 --> 00:56:16.446
<v Interviewer>You know I'm great, yeah.</v>

1268
00:56:16.446 --> 00:56:17.746
It usually gets a big thumbs up.

1269
00:56:17.746 --> 00:56:20.504
<v ->Yeah, I don't wanna back here in those old thing,</v>

1270
00:56:20.504 --> 00:56:22.476
you know I was so free and flowing out there,

1271
00:56:22.476 --> 00:56:24.525
but world will become more like that.

1272
00:56:24.525 --> 00:56:29.525
So the idea of dying may be just so effortless,

1273
00:56:30.326 --> 00:56:34.206
and who knows, in the future if we actually will die,

1274
00:56:34.206 --> 00:56:36.925
we'll just come and go through any dimensions

1275
00:56:36.925 --> 00:56:38.625
we want to, you know.

1276
00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:41.666
But I do think in these interim stages,

1277
00:56:41.666 --> 00:56:43.946
we're going to, we're gonna have memory

1278
00:56:43.946 --> 00:56:46.746
of the history of the planet, we're gonna have

1279
00:56:46.746 --> 00:56:50.366
access to other dimensional zones,

1280
00:56:50.366 --> 00:56:52.976
and meetings with non-physical beings.

1281
00:56:53.366 --> 00:56:55.696
Like I think there is conference rooms,

1282
00:56:55.726 --> 00:56:57.426
I always see one up above my head.

1283
00:56:57.426 --> 00:56:59.426
I go up there, sit in that conference room

1284
00:56:59.426 --> 00:57:02.536
around the round table, and meet with other beings.

1285
00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:06.045
And there is a group mind that forms,

1286
00:57:06.045 --> 00:57:08.566
and ideas are transmitted.

1287
00:57:08.566 --> 00:57:10.286
So I think of the inventions that

1288
00:57:10.286 --> 00:57:11.706
are gonna come through, will come through

1289
00:57:11.706 --> 00:57:13.536
councils like that.

1290
00:57:13.806 --> 00:57:17.896
And there may be children involved in these councils,

1291
00:57:18.566 --> 00:57:21.516
you know, that they may exist in the other world

1292
00:57:21.516 --> 00:57:25.735
but also here in circles, you know, and teams.

1293
00:57:27.626 --> 00:57:31.185
So that we'll move in and out,

1294
00:57:31.185 --> 00:57:33.585
we'll be able to talk to non-physical beings

1295
00:57:33.585 --> 00:57:34.985
in these meeting zones,

1296
00:57:34.985 --> 00:57:36.485
where they come down in frequency

1297
00:57:36.485 --> 00:57:38.585
and we go up in frequency, we meet there.

1298
00:57:38.585 --> 00:57:39.905
<v Interviewer>Yes, and there's a lot of evidence</v>

1299
00:57:39.905 --> 00:57:41.446
of course this is already happening

1300
00:57:41.446 --> 00:57:42.746
for a lot of people now.

1301
00:57:42.746 --> 00:57:45.386
<v ->Yeah, and so talking to your dead relatives,</v>

1302
00:57:45.386 --> 00:57:47.485
they're not gone, you know, my father still

1303
00:57:47.485 --> 00:57:50.146
talks to me, you know, and I don't feel like

1304
00:57:50.146 --> 00:57:52.026
dead people are gone.

1305
00:57:52.026 --> 00:57:53.065
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

1306
00:57:53.065 --> 00:57:56.915
<v ->So I don't have that sadness and grief.</v>

1307
00:57:57.185 --> 00:57:57.887
<v Interviewer>Maybe we don't have</v>

1308
00:57:57.887 --> 00:57:59.047
to have that attachment anymore,

1309
00:57:59.047 --> 00:58:01.427
once we understand fluidity of life.

1310
00:58:01.427 --> 00:58:03.267
You know wear a vehicle for a while,

1311
00:58:03.267 --> 00:58:05.047
and then you wear another one somewhere else

1312
00:58:05.047 --> 00:58:06.227
down the road.

1313
00:58:06.227 --> 00:58:07.687
<v ->Other people always say grief is such</v>

1314
00:58:07.687 --> 00:58:09.127
a human emotion, but I think that

1315
00:58:09.127 --> 00:58:11.797
it's kind of an artificial emotion actually.

1316
00:58:11.867 --> 00:58:13.806
You know, that we don't need to have it.

1317
00:58:14.608 --> 00:58:16.288
Yeah you miss somebody, but that's only

1318
00:58:16.288 --> 00:58:18.168
if you think about how they're not there.

1319
00:58:18.168 --> 00:58:19.530
<v Interviewer>But that's also been programmed into us</v>

1320
00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:22.650
to feel a lot of that, yeah definitely.

1321
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:24.850
And so I guess just finally I mean,

1322
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:27.330
it feels like we've been talking for just a short time,

1323
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.030
but we've been talking for almost an hour

1324
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:31.749
we're in those time space things.

1325
00:58:31.749 --> 00:58:33.609
Any final thoughts?

1326
00:58:33.609 --> 00:58:35.409
We just have a minute or two left,

1327
00:58:35.409 --> 00:58:36.809
anything we haven't covered?

1328
00:58:37.539 --> 00:58:41.810
<v ->I just feel so positive and enthusiastic</v>

1329
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:43.690
about everything that's coming.

1330
00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:47.540
And it's like to me a great time to be alive,

1331
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:51.190
and to really stay open and stay abreast

1332
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.429
and attune to the flow of what's coming,

1333
00:58:54.429 --> 00:58:57.349
and the flow itself of energy and consciousness,

1334
00:58:57.349 --> 00:59:00.509
I think it's the collective consciousness in motion.

1335
00:59:00.509 --> 00:59:03.840
And I can just trust it, you know,

1336
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:06.750
and so I think the next thing that's coming is

1337
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:11.309
understanding how consciousness is going to work

1338
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:13.000
in the intuition age.

1339
00:59:13.709 --> 00:59:15.629
So if we can get a sense of that,

1340
00:59:15.629 --> 00:59:18.590
then we can get into it faster, you know.

1341
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:19.490
<v Interviewer>And that's part of the</v>

1342
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.650
coming to your home frequency,

1343
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.510
that's why you've written this book.

1344
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:25.570
Well, on that note, I would encourage

1345
00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:26.790
people to pick it up.

1346
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:28.570
And pick up a copy and start working with it,

1347
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:29.690
don't just read it through,

1348
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.510
but actually work with this book,

1349
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:33.030
it was designed to be worked with.

1350
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:34.830
<v ->It is, it is a guide book.</v>

1351
00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:36.211
<v Interviewer>And I just want to thank you so much</v>

1352
00:59:36.211 --> 00:59:39.132
for your time, this is delightful.

1353
00:59:39.132 --> 00:59:41.552
<v ->Fun, but it went away too fast.</v>

1354
00:59:41.552 --> 00:59:43.533
<v Interviewer>It did, we could talk for hours and more.</v>

1355
00:59:43.533 --> 00:59:45.393
So on that note, thank you so much,

1356
00:59:45.393 --> 00:59:46.973
and I look forward to working with your book

1357
00:59:46.973 --> 00:59:47.912
some more myself.

1358
00:59:47.912 --> 00:59:50.083
<v ->Great, thank you.</v>

1359
00:59:52.213 --> 00:59:54.313
<v ->As a lifelong clairvoyant empath,</v>

1360
00:59:54.313 --> 00:59:56.133
Penney still does private sessions

1361
00:59:56.133 --> 00:59:58.233
for people who wan to have a second opinion

1362
00:59:58.233 --> 01:00:00.273
or have a glimpse into their field.

1363
01:00:00.273 --> 01:00:02.793
She advises business leaders, spiritual teachers

1364
01:00:02.793 --> 01:00:04.453
and people like us.

1365
01:00:04.453 --> 01:00:06.213
To connect with Penney and her books,

1366
01:00:06.213 --> 01:00:08.893
meditations and readings, you can visit her website

1367
01:00:08.893 --> 01:00:11.622
at thefrequencybook.com.

1368
01:00:11.772 --> 01:00:14.215
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1369
01:00:14.215 --> 01:00:19.215
(sentimental music)
