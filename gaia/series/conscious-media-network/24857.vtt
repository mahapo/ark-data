00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.687
<v ->As promised in the spring,</v>

2
00:00:01.687 --> 00:00:03.585
we caught up with Jessica Murray once again,

3
00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.188
to learn how the U.S.'s astrological chart

4
00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:07.372
is playing out.

5
00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:08.694
These are the times she warned of

6
00:00:08.694 --> 00:00:10.038
several months ago.

7
00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:11.595
While there is no shortage of proof

8
00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.216
that we're experiencing rapid

9
00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:15.542
and surprising changes on many fronts,

10
00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:18.123
Jessica says, the way events are playing out

11
00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:19.979
are part of a much larger picture,

12
00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:22.741
both collectively and personally.

13
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:27.741 line:15% 
(soft music)

14
00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.772
<v Voiceover>It is a bustling, sunny, beautiful day here</v>

15
00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:35.786
in San Francisco.

16
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.460
I'm so happy to see you again.

17
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.740
There's so much life outside

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.117
(laughs) on the street.

19
00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:43.657
Jessica this is a really interesting time

20
00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:45.076
as we've just gone through

21
00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:47.380
these major shifts, downward spirals

22
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.857
in the markets globally, the United States, everywhere.

23
00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:53.139
It appears the economic structures

24
00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:55.987
are literally falling apart at the seams.

25
00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:57.662
And when we last talked to you,

26
00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:59.571
we were looking at

27
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.702
this time.

28
00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:02.355
That's why we agreed to get back together,

29
00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:03.624
to see what happened.

30
00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:05.352
And we were focusing on

31
00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:07.493
Pluto and Capricorn.

32
00:01:07.493 --> 00:01:08.786
But there's a lot more to it.

33
00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:09.832
So with that said.

34
00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:11.847
You just take it where you would like to

35
00:01:11.847 --> 00:01:12.637
to start it,

36
00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.471
and I have more questions.

37
00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:16.188
<v ->The Pluto and Capricorn is still</v>

38
00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:18.865
the overarching theme.

39
00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.084
It's like the hour hand of a clock.

40
00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:23.206
Against which you have the minute hand,

41
00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:25.243
which are quickly moving cycles.

42
00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:28.198
And then second hands too.

43
00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:31.110
And you know transits all stack up.

44
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.192
So that when they all stack up

45
00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.349
like the three hands of Big Ben or something,

46
00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:38.992
then you get the chimes.

47
00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:40.197
<v Voiceover>Are we hearing the chimes?</v>

48
00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:41.872
<v ->And this is what happened.</v>

49
00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:44.122
On the ides of September, for example,

50
00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:45.893
it's such a classic example

51
00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:48.583
of this phenomenon happening.

52
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:52.369
Pluto and Capricorn, Pluto breakdown,

53
00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.505
Capricorn monetary structures.

54
00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:57.809
This was the theme for the whole year.

55
00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:59.153
It started in January.

56
00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:04.153
But then, Saturn started to oppose Uranus last month.

57
00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:07.718
<v Voiceover>And that would be in September.</v>

58
00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:09.456
As we're talking right now.

59
00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:11.291
<v ->It's entering into orb.</v>

60
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.040
It doesn't peak on the exact degree

61
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.778
until November 4th.

62
00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:16.752
<v Voiceover>Okay, auspicious day,</v>

63
00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:17.562
election day here--

64
00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:19.301
<v Jessica>Election day.</v>
<v Voiceover>in the U.S.</v>

65
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.818
<v ->Which is, you can't make this stuff up.</v>

66
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:24.836
<v Voiceover>(laughs) So okay let's just start with that,</v>

67
00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:26.340
what does that mean?

68
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.572
<v ->Well, Saturn opposes Uranus</v>

69
00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:30.980
once every 35 years.

70
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.217
I'm doing my little thing

71
00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:33.540
to show it's in opposition,

72
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.417
and to show that it's a tug of war.

73
00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:37.998
And when you know what these two symbols mean,

74
00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:40.430
you can fill in the blanks in your mind.

75
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.691
Uranus is revolution.

76
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:44.334
It governs lightening.

77
00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:48.398
It governs shattering, shocking upheaval.

78
00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:52.536
Saturn represents business as usual.

79
00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:55.597
Whatever a given culture imagines that to be,

80
00:02:55.597 --> 00:02:58.317
it governs the status quo mind.

81
00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:03.095
So this is the biggest opposition

82
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:05.005
of the calendar year.

83
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.415
And astrologers have been looking forward to it

84
00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:08.620
for a while too.

85
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.786
I mean that some kind of

86
00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:15.287
relatively radical overturn was going to happen.

87
00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:19.489
But going back to this idea of stacking transits,

88
00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.092
we also infer that it was going to have something

89
00:03:22.092 --> 00:03:24.577
to do with the Pluto and Capricorn

90
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:26.827
overarching themes.

91
00:03:26.827 --> 00:03:31.051
Which is going on until, you know, 2022

92
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:32.843
when Pluto has a return

93
00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:35.627
to its natal position in the USA chart.

94
00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:38.592
That's been in our sights the most.

95
00:03:38.592 --> 00:03:40.032
So here we have this Saturn

96
00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:44.064
and Pluto, I'm sorry Saturn/Uranus opposition,

97
00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:47.264
which is a two year transit

98
00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:50.026
on top of this thing.

99
00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:53.343
And then we have the full moon.

100
00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:55.551
Which lined up in Virgo and Pisces

101
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.263
with this Saturn/Uranus opposition.

102
00:03:59.263 --> 00:04:00.660
So that was the second hand

103
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.495
coming up to meet the other two,

104
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.169
and that's when we heard the chimes.

105
00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.121
<v Voiceover>And the chimes look like?</v>

106
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.444
<v ->The chimes...</v>

107
00:04:07.444 --> 00:04:09.876
<v Voiceover>Or sounded like, I should say.</v>

108
00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:12.083
<v ->Well we had a triggering</v>

109
00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:16.009
of the financial crumbling,

110
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.422
which is an ongoing, several years long phenomenon

111
00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:22.621
from Pluto and Capricorn.

112
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:27.351
But the Saturn/Uranus has a lot of implications.

113
00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:31.560
For one thing Uranus speeds up everything it touches.

114
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.327
It accelerates whenever it's in an aspect web.

115
00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:37.214
<v Voiceover>And these events that</v>

116
00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:39.678
unfolded from September 15th up to present,

117
00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.374
which has been about three and a half weeks,

118
00:04:41.374 --> 00:04:43.667
are just unprecedented.

119
00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.406
Well maybe 1929,

120
00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:48.062
but since 1929 it's been unprecedented.

121
00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:49.352
<v ->You know the last time that Uranus</v>

122
00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:52.744
and Saturn opposed was in the 20s.

123
00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:54.792
And you know we had this giddy economic

124
00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:59.197
and sexual upheaval in the social fabric of the USA.

125
00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:02.589
And Europe was just staggering to its feet

126
00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:04.477
after World War I.

127
00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:06.215
And then the time after that

128
00:05:06.215 --> 00:05:09.703
that it happened was the mid 60s.

129
00:05:09.703 --> 00:05:11.082
So there was this, you know,

130
00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:14.303
complete social cataclysm

131
00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:18.420
by supposedly sex, drugs and rock-n-roll.

132
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.860
But as you say this time

133
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.452
it's going to be completely different.

134
00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:26.825
Because this is the end of 13th baktun

135
00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:28.211
of the Mayan calendar

136
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.974
that we talked about last time.

137
00:05:30.974 --> 00:05:34.163
And the grand cross that's coming up

138
00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:36.669
is in the background.

139
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.619
So we can look at the things

140
00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:38.472
that are the same,

141
00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:39.496
and things that are different.

142
00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:41.213
This is what astrologers do.

143
00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:42.824
We look at the common denominators

144
00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:45.672
between, you know, what happened last time

145
00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:47.602
Saturn opposed to Uranus.

146
00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:51.191
Well we also had lightening striking the tower.

147
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:53.852
And if we want to really be

148
00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:56.359
at the core truth of what these things mean,

149
00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:58.673
we have to get archetypal.

150
00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:00.284
I'm not that kind of astrologer

151
00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:03.462
that deals in predication anyway.

152
00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:04.412
Who was it?

153
00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:07.084
It was Rick Tarnas who said that,

154
00:06:07.084 --> 00:06:11.585
"The predictions astrology makes are archetypal."

155
00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:13.612
They predict archetypal themes

156
00:06:13.612 --> 00:06:15.606
with complete precision.

157
00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:17.227
Not literal events.

158
00:06:17.227 --> 00:06:19.318
That's not where we shine.

159
00:06:19.318 --> 00:06:22.646
So why even make guesswork out of it.

160
00:06:22.646 --> 00:06:25.803
But the lightening struck tower

161
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:29.141
is the picture for the Saturn/Uranus opposition.

162
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:31.232
So what is the tower?

163
00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:34.325
In the USA it's materialism.

164
00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:38.839
And what just blew me away about

165
00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.876
these events a few weeks ago,

166
00:06:40.876 --> 00:06:43.297
is that it wasn't just any

167
00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:45.644
institutions that were hit.

168
00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:47.403
It was the absolute, you know--

169
00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:49.229
<v Voiceover>Pillars.</v>
<v Jessica>Long standing</v>

170
00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.102
<v ->pillars</v>

171
00:06:50.102 --> 00:06:51.403
<v Jessica>the titans.</v>
<v Voiceover>Towers.</v>

172
00:06:51.403 --> 00:06:53.323
<v ->of the industry, you know.</v>

173
00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:56.296
The most reputable, you know, solid brick

174
00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:58.782
and their naming banks, Rock of Gibraltar

175
00:06:58.782 --> 00:07:01.032
and the symbolism of Saturn.

176
00:07:01.032 --> 00:07:01.864
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

177
00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:05.693
<v ->Which is the epitomical stability</v>

178
00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.805
of a whole belief system really,

179
00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:11.730
that has to do with materialism.

180
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.194
So if we look underneath what happened

181
00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:15.538
on Wall Street,

182
00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:18.636
and we see what it itself symbolizes.

183
00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.512
In the tarot deck designed by Barbara Walker,

184
00:07:23.512 --> 00:07:26.712
she's got, for that card,

185
00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.035
are you familiar with this deck?

186
00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:28.867
<v Voiceover>I'm not.</v>

187
00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:32.099
<v ->She's got the pope falling off one side,</v>

188
00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:34.307
and Caesar falling off the other.

189
00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:35.331
<v Voiceover>Of the tower?</v>

190
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:36.632
<v ->Church and state,</v>

191
00:07:36.632 --> 00:07:39.000
while lightening breaks through

192
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.133
the structure in the middle.

193
00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:42.498
<v Voiceover>Well there seems to be some truth</v>

194
00:07:42.498 --> 00:07:46.076
in that symbolism, in current events.

195
00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:49.634
<v ->So the full moon brought it to a head</v>

196
00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:51.746
on the ides of September.

197
00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.324
And I have to say that

198
00:07:53.324 --> 00:07:55.383
we need to look at this idea of urgency

199
00:07:55.383 --> 00:07:56.385
very carefully.

200
00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:59.735
Uranus has to do with speed and

201
00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:03.329
emergency, and a sense of immediacy.

202
00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:06.667
And we can all feel it.

203
00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:09.153
Every sentient being can feel it,

204
00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:10.667
in the airwaves.

205
00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:13.494
You'd have to be really blind, deaf and dumb not to.

206
00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:16.448
But we have to be careful of how it's used.

207
00:08:16.448 --> 00:08:18.464
And the way it was used by the government

208
00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.715
in terms of this bailout.

209
00:08:20.715 --> 00:08:23.925
I call it a, you have to put in quotes,

210
00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:25.546
it's a faux bailout.

211
00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:26.848
<v Voiceover>Right, a faux bailout.</v>

212
00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:28.170
<v ->I mean nobody really knows that.</v>

213
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.887
That 700 billion dollar figure

214
00:08:29.887 --> 00:08:31.519
might as well, hell have been

215
00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.951
chosen at random.

216
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:35.135
You know who's that guy?

217
00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:37.087
That Harvard guy, Rogoff,

218
00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:39.039
thinks that it's more likely to be

219
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.442
two trillion dollars.

220
00:08:40.442 --> 00:08:41.110
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

221
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.598
<v ->That these junk assets would really cost.</v>

222
00:08:44.598 --> 00:08:47.189
So really nobody knows what they're doing.

223
00:08:47.189 --> 00:08:50.400
And it's this idea of grabbing at straws.

224
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.088
But when it happened,

225
00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:55.477
it was urged upon the people and Congress

226
00:08:55.477 --> 00:08:59.178
with this sense of immediacy.

227
00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:01.354
Which was using Uranus

228
00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:05.402
in a cohersive political way.

229
00:09:05.402 --> 00:09:06.602
These are the kind of things

230
00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:08.457
which people who want to stay awake

231
00:09:08.457 --> 00:09:09.524
during the coming years

232
00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:11.476
have got to be aware of.

233
00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.087
Cause there's a very dark side

234
00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:16.841
to these potent transits.

235
00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:20.905
Always when Saturn opposes an outer planet,

236
00:09:20.905 --> 00:09:24.986
world altering events occur.

237
00:09:24.986 --> 00:09:26.451
And in this case you had the

238
00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:28.712
urgency of Uranus

239
00:09:28.712 --> 00:09:30.527
being pressed into service

240
00:09:30.527 --> 00:09:33.621
to give an ultimatum.

241
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:34.435
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

242
00:09:34.435 --> 00:09:35.321
<v ->You know scam artists are--</v>

243
00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:35.876
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

244
00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.486
<v ->They all know that this is the way</v>

245
00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:38.947
to play a mark.

246
00:09:38.947 --> 00:09:40.942
You say you have to sign here right now!

247
00:09:40.942 --> 00:09:42.776
You can't vet it, you can't think about it.

248
00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:43.566
Or all will be lost.

249
00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:45.304
<v Voiceover>Well they weren't even allowed to</v>

250
00:09:45.304 --> 00:09:47.771
read it or study it

251
00:09:47.771 --> 00:09:48.838
from what I understand

252
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.205
from members of the House of Representatives

253
00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:52.838
and the Senate.

254
00:09:52.838 --> 00:09:53.862
<v ->Nobody could read it.</v>

255
00:09:53.862 --> 00:09:57.158
That was part of Bush going on TV

256
00:09:57.158 --> 00:09:59.056
insisting that we don't.

257
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:01.894
But you know did you see that Jon Stewart--

258
00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:02.427
<v Voiceover>Which one?</v>

259
00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:03.654
<v ->Take on The Daily Show,</v>

260
00:10:03.654 --> 00:10:05.937
when he showed clippings of

261
00:10:05.937 --> 00:10:08.166
Bush's speech just before we

262
00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:11.206
bombed Iraq, and Bush's speech

263
00:10:11.206 --> 00:10:12.688
insisting that the bailout

264
00:10:12.688 --> 00:10:14.224
had to be done right now.

265
00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:15.429
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v Jessica>With no vetting.</v>

266
00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:16.219
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

267
00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:18.213
<v ->He used the same words.</v>

268
00:10:18.213 --> 00:10:20.325
It was the same ploy.

269
00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:23.302
Anyway the sense of urgency

270
00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:25.809
I want to talk a little bit about because

271
00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:27.345
it's not over,

272
00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:29.179
and it's going to be running through

273
00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:32.912
all of our veins from here on out.

274
00:10:32.912 --> 00:10:35.846
It only reaches its first of five exactitudes

275
00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:38.193
on November 4th.

276
00:10:39.093 --> 00:10:41.303
So people are going to have to get grounded,

277
00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:45.068
unless they're going to be swept up in a panic.

278
00:10:45.068 --> 00:10:47.158
And I hope we have time to talk about

279
00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:49.451
some techniques to deal with the fear

280
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:51.179
in the air.

281
00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:52.267
<v Voiceover>We will make sure we do</v>

282
00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:54.678
toward the end of the interview.

283
00:10:54.678 --> 00:10:57.024
And also, may I just ask something?

284
00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:58.560
<v ->Yeah.</v>

285
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.768
<v Voiceover>Historically my understanding is</v>

286
00:11:00.768 --> 00:11:03.595
that the people at the top of the pyramid,

287
00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:06.261
the market makers and so forth,

288
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:10.325
are not unaware of astrological transits

289
00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:12.021
and so forth.

290
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:13.397
It's not as though this is something

291
00:11:13.397 --> 00:11:14.719
that's hidden from their view,

292
00:11:14.719 --> 00:11:16.415
and they wouldn't understand.

293
00:11:16.415 --> 00:11:18.924
It's not as though they're just reacting.

294
00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:21.089
I mean this is known in the--

295
00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:21.942
<v Voiceover>most--</v>
<v Jessica>Most astrologers--</v>

296
00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:23.158
<v Voiceover>immediate circles.</v>

297
00:11:23.158 --> 00:11:24.363
<v ->believe that, I mean certainly NASA--</v>

298
00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:24.613
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

299
00:11:24.613 --> 00:11:26.487
<v ->is famous for having an astrologer.</v>

300
00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:27.415
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

301
00:11:27.415 --> 00:11:29.228
<v ->And all governments that I've ever known of.</v>

302
00:11:29.228 --> 00:11:31.799
But the thing is if they had

303
00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.143
really wanted it,

304
00:11:33.143 --> 00:11:34.679
the kind of things that makes us doubt

305
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.556
that truism is that

306
00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:39.116
they choose during Mercury retrograde

307
00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.782
to write that first bailout.

308
00:11:41.782 --> 00:11:44.107
Either they're slipping

309
00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:47.968
or they themselves are seized by the panic.

310
00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:50.422
This was a very stupid thing to do

311
00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:53.472
in street textbook astrological wisdom.

312
00:11:53.472 --> 00:11:56.928
But I also want to say that

313
00:11:58.348 --> 00:11:59.963
there was something about the sense

314
00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:03.195
of emergency that's very real.

315
00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:04.933
We have to be careful to

316
00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.621
not dismiss what's in the air

317
00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:09.296
just because people are manipulating it

318
00:12:09.296 --> 00:12:10.320
that we don't trust.

319
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

320
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.688
<v ->There's something going on</v>

321
00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:14.170
in the mass mind in other words,

322
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.373
that is, does have its finger truly on the pulse.

323
00:12:18.373 --> 00:12:23.373
That there is imminent systems collapse, globally.

324
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.930
That there is a sense of time speeding up.

325
00:12:29.028 --> 00:12:32.142
That means that we can't use time

326
00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:33.230
in the same old ways.

327
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.438
Lawmakers say, "Well in 10 years,

328
00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:38.115
we'll get started on reducing emissions."

329
00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:41.390
People are aware as animals,

330
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.502
in their animal knowing,

331
00:12:43.502 --> 00:12:45.475
that Uranus had a point

332
00:12:45.475 --> 00:12:47.608
it was trying to make about the urgency.

333
00:12:47.608 --> 00:12:48.717
It just wasn't the point

334
00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:51.341
that the pundits were talking about.

335
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:52.994
And that's why it worked.

336
00:12:55.844 --> 00:12:57.171
<v Voiceover>So we're looking at,</v>

337
00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:58.824
first of all the shattering

338
00:12:58.824 --> 00:13:00.072
of the structures,

339
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:01.512
which we've just talked about.

340
00:13:01.512 --> 00:13:03.763
And also, there's the whole subject

341
00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:07.549
of the public, and how the public is reacting.

342
00:13:07.549 --> 00:13:10.450
And certainly the word that you've mentioned,

343
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.914
prior to this moment,

344
00:13:12.914 --> 00:13:14.845
is mass disillusionment,

345
00:13:14.845 --> 00:13:16.146
and that is so true.

346
00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:17.949
People are left just

347
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:20.903
gap-jawed wondering how they're going to

348
00:13:20.903 --> 00:13:21.912
<v Voiceover>right now--</v>
<v Jessica>Yeah.</v>

349
00:13:21.912 --> 00:13:23.490
<v Voiceover>deal with their futures.</v>

350
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.816
Having worked 30 years for a company

351
00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:28.088
they may or may not have even enjoyed for

352
00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:30.306
to have a solid pension, rock solid that.

353
00:13:30.306 --> 00:13:30.690
<v ->Yeah.</v>

354
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Voiceover>Like you say, the Rock of Gibraltar.</v>

355
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.162
These things are beginning to crumble as well,

356
00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:37.316
in this mass disillusionment.

357
00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:42.316
<v ->Mass disillusionment is signified by Neptune,</v>

358
00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:46.745
which is going to hit the USA moon next spring.

359
00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:48.814
Now a little background.

360
00:13:48.814 --> 00:13:52.423
Neptune governs the whole concept of illusion.

361
00:13:52.423 --> 00:13:57.423
So it governs both illusion in the sense of lies.

362
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.964
And it governs illusion in the sense

363
00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:03.150
of the more existential sense

364
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.678
that we feel like, oh it's all appearance's

365
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.720
aren't what they seem to be.

366
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.088
People who work with astrology

367
00:14:09.088 --> 00:14:10.187
are use to looking at Neptune

368
00:14:10.187 --> 00:14:12.064
in a person's chart

369
00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:13.899
to make the person think

370
00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:16.224
that things have become meaningless.

371
00:14:16.224 --> 00:14:18.705
And its dark side is that.

372
00:14:18.705 --> 00:14:23.398
But Neptune also points to the way through illusion,

373
00:14:23.398 --> 00:14:27.025
which in the most esoteric level

374
00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.414
tells us just what the spiritual teachers

375
00:14:29.414 --> 00:14:31.409
of all the ages have told us,

376
00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:34.896
which is that everything in this veil of tears on Earth

377
00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:36.699
really is an illusion.

378
00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:38.960
In an absolute sense.

379
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.741
But this is such a hard concept,

380
00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:42.736
especially for a secular society,

381
00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:46.757
to grasp that we often see

382
00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:49.007
the negative side of Neptune manifesting

383
00:14:49.007 --> 00:14:50.607
in the mass mind.

384
00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:55.607
Which is kind of a low-level hysteria and conformity.

385
00:14:58.443 --> 00:14:59.910
<v Voiceover>Born out of fear.</v>

386
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.086
<v ->Born out of fear, a certain type of fear.</v>

387
00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:03.686
Saturn is fear too.

388
00:15:03.686 --> 00:15:05.691
It's a fear of loss.

389
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:10.022
Neptune is the fear that everything is a lie.

390
00:15:10.022 --> 00:15:12.166
Now it's very interesting

391
00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:17.166
that Neptune went into Aquarius in 19...

392
00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:21.799
Was it 98, at the peak of the impeachment hearings?

393
00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:25.489
The Clinton so-called impeachment.

394
00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:27.484
So there was this idea that

395
00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:30.941
the transit got inaugurated based on a lie.

396
00:15:30.941 --> 00:15:34.098
The lie in this case was this paltry little lie about sex.

397
00:15:34.098 --> 00:15:35.005
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

398
00:15:35.005 --> 00:15:38.162
<v ->When in fact, of course,</v>

399
00:15:38.162 --> 00:15:41.319
there were these massive lies going on.

400
00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:43.762
I mean not to mention that Clinton himself

401
00:15:43.762 --> 00:15:46.940
acted like a war criminal, quite literally.

402
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.023
Mercilessly bombing Yugoslovia.

403
00:15:50.023 --> 00:15:52.935
That whole business of bombing Sudan

404
00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:54.790
for what they claim they thought

405
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.953
was a weapons lab.

406
00:15:55.953 --> 00:15:58.321
Meanwhile the CIA had been on the ground for years.

407
00:15:58.321 --> 00:16:01.915
They knew it was a pharmaceuticals factory.

408
00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:04.503
Huge lies with the Menz implication switch

409
00:16:04.503 --> 00:16:06.156
hardly got a peep--

410
00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:06.406
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

411
00:16:06.406 --> 00:16:08.482
<v ->In reaction from the public.</v>

412
00:16:08.482 --> 00:16:11.991
But you see, what do they call it in psychology?

413
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:13.431
A displacement.

414
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:13.943
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

415
00:16:13.943 --> 00:16:17.004
<v ->On to this dinky, little adultery lie,</v>

416
00:16:17.004 --> 00:16:19.329
but there's something real there.

417
00:16:19.329 --> 00:16:22.433
It's just not being called what it is.

418
00:16:22.433 --> 00:16:24.685
So the Neptune and Aquarius years

419
00:16:24.685 --> 00:16:28.354
inaugurated this time

420
00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:31.863
where lies in government

421
00:16:31.863 --> 00:16:35.809
stopped being able to outrage people.

422
00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:37.857
That's the way I look at this era.

423
00:16:37.857 --> 00:16:39.361
<v Voiceover>That is very true.</v>

424
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:41.132
We're immune to it.

425
00:16:41.132 --> 00:16:44.822
<v ->And here you have a whole war based on a lie.</v>

426
00:16:44.822 --> 00:16:47.467
Actually first we had 9/11,

427
00:16:47.467 --> 00:16:50.070
which was the lie of the century.

428
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.803
The biggest fraud since the JFK official story,

429
00:16:53.803 --> 00:16:55.147
the assassination of JFK.

430
00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:56.640
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

431
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.147
<v ->And, you know, the official story</v>

432
00:16:59.147 --> 00:17:01.493
being so full of holes,

433
00:17:01.493 --> 00:17:03.253
like with Swiss cheese,

434
00:17:03.253 --> 00:17:06.134
that somehow like the other lies

435
00:17:06.134 --> 00:17:07.148
we talked about,

436
00:17:07.148 --> 00:17:10.102
are to staggering for the mass mind

437
00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:11.723
to accomodate.

438
00:17:11.723 --> 00:17:15.026
So they displace it onto these dinky, little lies.

439
00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:18.365
And they get upset about flag pins.

440
00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:20.711
Anyway, what's going to happen

441
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:23.132
is that the planet Neptune

442
00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:26.119
is going to conjoin with the planet Jupiter,

443
00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.335
and they're both going to conjoin

444
00:17:27.335 --> 00:17:30.183
with the planetoid Chiron,

445
00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:33.596
which governs wounds.

446
00:17:33.596 --> 00:17:37.382
Jupiter governs magnification,

447
00:17:37.382 --> 00:17:40.379
so great big wounds.

448
00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:45.379
And Neptune is illusion, lies, deceit.

449
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.549
So the picture we have,

450
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:49.765
this is all next spring,

451
00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:52.293
they're going to culminate

452
00:17:52.293 --> 00:17:55.237
on the USA moon which is the,

453
00:17:55.237 --> 00:17:56.310
In mundane astrology,

454
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.077
governs the public mood.

455
00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:00.421
<v Voiceover>So give us an idea</v>

456
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:03.813
in the trenches of how that would appear?

457
00:18:03.813 --> 00:18:06.320
Either historically or hypothetically?

458
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.151
<v ->Well I think that, to use the language of psychology,</v>

459
00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:14.148
it is the chance for people to wake up

460
00:18:14.148 --> 00:18:17.092
to the wounds they've already been in.

461
00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:21.295
To lies that they've already known about.

462
00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:23.684
Eric Francis, this wonderful astrologer,

463
00:18:23.684 --> 00:18:27.598
has this theory about this transit coming up that

464
00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:32.731
it's the syndrome of the abused child.

465
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:34.405
Not to mention that literally,

466
00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:39.405
probably one in four children in this culture,

467
00:18:39.514 --> 00:18:41.114
have been literally abused,

468
00:18:41.114 --> 00:18:42.767
either sexually or physically,

469
00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:44.410
certainly emotionally.

470
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.828
And it's not talked about

471
00:18:45.828 --> 00:18:49.476
in any way, the way it's going to have to be.

472
00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:51.748
So that's one level of the reality.

473
00:18:51.748 --> 00:18:53.561
But the other level is that

474
00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:57.134
there's a syndrome that psychologists notice

475
00:18:57.134 --> 00:19:00.622
that abused children who go into this

476
00:19:00.622 --> 00:19:02.457
helpless, this empowerlessness

477
00:19:02.457 --> 00:19:04.654
and who enable the lies all around them

478
00:19:04.654 --> 00:19:06.112
just to stay alive.

479
00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:06.650
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

480
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.388
<v ->It's some kind of a survival mechanism.</v>

481
00:19:08.388 --> 00:19:09.199
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

482
00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:12.250
<v ->That the American people have done this.</v>

483
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.361
Some of the enabling mechanisms,

484
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:17.049
also governed by Neptune,

485
00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:18.937
are drugs.

486
00:19:18.937 --> 00:19:21.668
This time it's legal drugs, you know.

487
00:19:21.668 --> 00:19:23.577
A generation before it was all this

488
00:19:23.577 --> 00:19:25.667
hoo and cry about marijuana.

489
00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:26.681
Well that's nothing.

490
00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Voiceover>Well prior to that it was martinis.</v>

491
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.465
(laughs)

492
00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:31.022
<v ->But compared to the epidemic,</v>

493
00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:33.412
since Neptune went into Aquarius--

494
00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:34.158
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

495
00:19:34.158 --> 00:19:35.758
<v ->Prescription drugs are just taking off.</v>

496
00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:36.483
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

497
00:19:36.483 --> 00:19:38.734
<v ->And, you know, there isn't anywhere near it</v>

498
00:19:38.734 --> 00:19:41.144
catching up to the significance of that.

499
00:19:41.144 --> 00:19:44.398
That there was when LSD and stuff

500
00:19:44.398 --> 00:19:47.629
you know, shocked the pants off of a previous generation.

501
00:19:47.629 --> 00:19:48.856
<v Voiceover>Well and there's an element,</v>

502
00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:51.778
a much larger element of lies and illusion

503
00:19:51.778 --> 00:19:53.869
in the pushing of these drugs

504
00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:56.493
were talking about now, prescription drugs.

505
00:19:56.493 --> 00:19:57.421
<v ->Yes, everybody--</v>

506
00:19:57.421 --> 00:19:57.933
<v Voiceover>It's all an illusion and a lie.</v>

507
00:19:57.933 --> 00:19:58.840
<v ->Lying about it.</v>

508
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.184
The people who are taking them are lying.

509
00:20:00.184 --> 00:20:00.696
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

510
00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:01.442
<v ->The AMA is lying.</v>

511
00:20:01.442 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

512
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:02.946
<v ->But, you know--</v>

513
00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:03.576
<v Voiceover>It's a fraud.</v>

514
00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:05.879
<v ->I think there's another level of hypnosis,</v>

515
00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:07.874
mass hypnosis.

516
00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.679
The media is...

517
00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:13.186
Neptune governs literal hypnosis.

518
00:20:13.186 --> 00:20:15.767
The biggest hypnotic we have going on

519
00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.839
in this society, besides the meds, is television.

520
00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

521
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.369
<v ->And what the media has done now</v>

522
00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:24.321
with its plethora of, you know,

523
00:20:24.321 --> 00:20:27.084
satellite and computer and cable,

524
00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:32.084
is to give this overwhelming inundation

525
00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:37.289
of hypnotic infotainment like data

526
00:20:39.851 --> 00:20:41.525
and stimuli.

527
00:20:41.525 --> 00:20:45.664
Making people, not only not more informed,

528
00:20:45.664 --> 00:20:47.978
but staggering around like zombies

529
00:20:47.978 --> 00:20:50.005
in this hypnotic state.

530
00:20:50.005 --> 00:20:53.365
Now this took off when Neptune entered Aquarius.

531
00:20:53.365 --> 00:20:56.661
And I would add to that the cell phone thing,

532
00:20:56.661 --> 00:20:59.007
which people take so for granted now.

533
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:02.143
They can't imagine life without it.

534
00:21:02.143 --> 00:21:05.417
But when you look at what Aquarius means,

535
00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:09.129
it governs the group intelligence.

536
00:21:09.129 --> 00:21:12.990
Aquarius is the sign of the group.

537
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.798
People en masse making connections or not.

538
00:21:16.798 --> 00:21:20.209
And I think of cell phones,

539
00:21:20.209 --> 00:21:24.755
the way people turn into a certain type of obliviousness.

540
00:21:24.755 --> 00:21:25.918
You know when you're on the bus

541
00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:28.520
and somebody's there with a cell phone

542
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.590
yakking about some banality,

543
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:35.590
with a real obliviousness about the public space around it.

544
00:21:35.923 --> 00:21:38.408
There is something that's happened to public space,

545
00:21:38.408 --> 00:21:42.728
people are complaining a lot,

546
00:21:42.728 --> 00:21:46.674
worrying a lot about private space being abrogated.

547
00:21:46.674 --> 00:21:49.226
But it's really public space

548
00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:52.274
that is taking a dive.

549
00:21:52.274 --> 00:21:55.730
You know I've noticed that people talk to themselves more,

550
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.895
are walking down the street.

551
00:21:57.895 --> 00:21:59.889
Even when they don't have one of these little things

552
00:21:59.889 --> 00:22:01.468
going on in their ear.

553
00:22:01.468 --> 00:22:04.582
Because I think that the cell phone phenomenon

554
00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:08.945
has entered into the way we interact and don't interact

555
00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:11.035
in public to such an extent.

556
00:22:11.035 --> 00:22:12.454
<v Voiceover>It's oblivious nature, yeah.</v>

557
00:22:12.454 --> 00:22:14.448
<v ->That the obliviousness is carried on</v>

558
00:22:14.448 --> 00:22:16.912
even when we're not talking on the things.

559
00:22:16.912 --> 00:22:18.832
Have you noticed people talking to themselves more?

560
00:22:18.832 --> 00:22:20.091
<v Voiceover>Well when I was coming in</v>

561
00:22:20.091 --> 00:22:21.595
to the building here,

562
00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:23.685
there was a lady talking to herself at great length.

563
00:22:23.685 --> 00:22:25.264
<v ->It use to be just street people and ones</v>

564
00:22:25.264 --> 00:22:26.544
who you go, uh oh.

565
00:22:26.544 --> 00:22:26.919
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

566
00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:27.921
<v Jessica>But now.</v>
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

567
00:22:27.921 --> 00:22:29.841
<v ->And with children.</v>

568
00:22:29.841 --> 00:22:32.486
It saddens me very much.

569
00:22:32.486 --> 00:22:34.278
A mother can be with her child

570
00:22:34.278 --> 00:22:36.582
and she's on the phone now.

571
00:22:37.662 --> 00:22:40.476
So this is the dark side of Neptune and Aquarius.

572
00:22:40.476 --> 00:22:42.193
What's going to happen

573
00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:45.724
when these planets conjoin in May,

574
00:22:45.724 --> 00:22:46.748
that's when they peak.

575
00:22:46.748 --> 00:22:48.956
We can feel it now

576
00:22:48.956 --> 00:22:51.302
already they're on the onramp,

577
00:22:51.302 --> 00:22:54.385
is that the wound that all this has caused

578
00:22:54.385 --> 00:22:56.102
will culminate.

579
00:22:56.102 --> 00:22:57.894
And we have to diagnose the wound

580
00:22:57.894 --> 00:23:00.955
before we can even begin to heal it.

581
00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:04.967
So like with all these cataclysmic transits,

582
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:07.045
people are going to have to bite the bullet

583
00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:09.786
and realize that there has to be a confrontation

584
00:23:09.786 --> 00:23:10.757
with the illness.

585
00:23:10.757 --> 00:23:13.306
That's why I'm talking about Soul Sick Nation.

586
00:23:13.306 --> 00:23:14.053
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

587
00:23:14.053 --> 00:23:16.005
<v ->I don't talk about evil or badness.</v>

588
00:23:16.005 --> 00:23:18.255
It's a sickness.

589
00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:19.482
And Chrion's involvement

590
00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:23.364
talks about the potential for a cure.

591
00:23:23.364 --> 00:23:25.316
But not until people wake up to

592
00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:27.684
what we've been under.

593
00:23:29.594 --> 00:23:31.332
<v Voiceover>Well we can toward the end</v>

594
00:23:31.332 --> 00:23:32.474
when we talk about fear

595
00:23:32.474 --> 00:23:34.074
and look at what that cure,

596
00:23:34.074 --> 00:23:37.860
that collective cure also would look like.

597
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.601
And also we are looking at a type of

598
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:43.876
now, certainly with economic downturn in events,

599
00:23:43.876 --> 00:23:47.331
globally we're looking with a much more extreme polarity.

600
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:48.217
<v ->Polarizations.</v>

601
00:23:48.217 --> 00:23:49.913
<v Voiceover>Among the human species.</v>

602
00:23:49.913 --> 00:23:52.675
<v ->Yeah, I think this is a very good point.</v>

603
00:23:52.675 --> 00:23:56.781
You know astrologically we see very clearly

604
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.171
that whenever Saturn,

605
00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.451
which represents if you will

606
00:24:00.451 --> 00:24:01.730
the collective consciousness,

607
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.354
what they think reality is.

608
00:24:04.354 --> 00:24:07.458
A collective decision about what reality is.

609
00:24:07.458 --> 00:24:10.615
Opposes one of the three outer planets,

610
00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:12.546
which are really the big guns in the sky,

611
00:24:12.546 --> 00:24:14.498
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.

612
00:24:14.498 --> 00:24:18.721
We always get a polarization

613
00:24:18.721 --> 00:24:20.791
that feels more stringent

614
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:22.881
than the one before.

615
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:25.430
This era started with a polarity

616
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:30.430
between Saturn and Pluto in 2000, 2001.

617
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:33.440
And of course, the WTC bombings

618
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.904
were the epitomical example of that.

619
00:24:35.904 --> 00:24:37.110
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

620
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.149
<v ->The next one was Saturn opposing Neptune,</v>

621
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:42.037
tug of war.

622
00:24:42.037 --> 00:24:44.128
And the polarization there

623
00:24:44.128 --> 00:24:47.114
manifested in Katrina.

624
00:24:47.114 --> 00:24:49.909
And finally the breaking through

625
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:54.909
the crust of public denial about global warming.

626
00:24:55.114 --> 00:24:59.775
Now we're under Saturn opposed to Uranus,

627
00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:03.007
and we have the meltdown on Wall Street,

628
00:25:03.007 --> 00:25:05.993
which is happening all over the world now,

629
00:25:05.993 --> 00:25:07.465
the ripple effect.

630
00:25:07.465 --> 00:25:09.406
As we would expect.

631
00:25:09.406 --> 00:25:12.382
And has to do with

632
00:25:12.382 --> 00:25:14.035
a polarization if you will

633
00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:15.145
on the simplest level

634
00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:17.513
between Saturn the past,

635
00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:20.211
and Uranus the future.

636
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:22.216
Did you know by the way

637
00:25:22.216 --> 00:25:23.763
that the word Palin

638
00:25:23.763 --> 00:25:26.707
as a Latin root, means backwards?

639
00:25:26.707 --> 00:25:27.709
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

640
00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:31.282
Well no I didn't but it seems very appropriate.

641
00:25:31.282 --> 00:25:31.923
Thank you for sharing.

642
00:25:31.923 --> 00:25:32.957
<v ->Do want another thing?</v>

643
00:25:32.957 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Voiceover>I love it.</v>

644
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.229
<v ->The word palindrome, you know the word palindrome?</v>

645
00:25:35.229 --> 00:25:35.975
<v Voiceover>(laughs) No.</v>

646
00:25:35.975 --> 00:25:39.314
<v ->Which is the word that you can read backwards.</v>

647
00:25:40.244 --> 00:25:41.742
The universe puns you know.

648
00:25:41.742 --> 00:25:42.718
<v Voiceover>Yes it does.</v>

649
00:25:42.718 --> 00:25:44.083
<v ->So here's a cosmic pun.</v>

650
00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:46.768
<v ->So we have (both voices talk over each other)</v>

651
00:25:46.768 --> 00:25:51.557
classic Saturn figure in this woman

652
00:25:51.557 --> 00:25:53.391
opposed to Uranus,

653
00:25:53.391 --> 00:25:55.695
which really does represent change.

654
00:25:55.695 --> 00:25:58.319
Whatever candidate can mouth the word?

655
00:25:58.319 --> 00:25:59.780
I mean Uranus can tell a sound bite

656
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.732
from real radical change.

657
00:26:01.732 --> 00:26:04.452
But regardless of who is president

658
00:26:04.452 --> 00:26:06.628
we're going to have these planets opposing

659
00:26:06.628 --> 00:26:08.259
in the sky.

660
00:26:08.259 --> 00:26:11.417
And it represents very blatantly,

661
00:26:11.417 --> 00:26:13.902
are you going to cling to the past?

662
00:26:13.902 --> 00:26:15.384
Are you going to use these old models

663
00:26:15.384 --> 00:26:17.656
from the financial to the cultural?

664
00:26:17.656 --> 00:26:19.651
Or are you going to look ahead

665
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:22.563
into completely alien uncharted territory,

666
00:26:22.563 --> 00:26:24.162
which is terrifying.

667
00:26:24.162 --> 00:26:26.509
Which is what Uranus governs.

668
00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:28.781
But then it also governs freedom.

669
00:26:28.781 --> 00:26:30.103
<v Voiceover>Well it's at our feet right now.</v>

670
00:26:30.103 --> 00:26:30.829
We have no choice

671
00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:32.941
but to look into these uncharted territories.

672
00:26:32.941 --> 00:26:35.327
<v ->We have no choice,</v>

673
00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:38.018
I would say anybody who has two brain cells

674
00:26:38.018 --> 00:26:41.068
to rub together would conclude that.

675
00:26:41.068 --> 00:26:44.055
But we also have to look realistically,

676
00:26:44.055 --> 00:26:45.750
that every time there is a Saturn

677
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.894
outer planet opposition,

678
00:26:47.894 --> 00:26:51.814
the forces of retrenchment grow.

679
00:26:51.814 --> 00:26:54.785
And there's nothing uglier and meanier

680
00:26:54.785 --> 00:26:58.379
and at least temporarily more powerful,

681
00:26:58.379 --> 00:27:00.352
than a staggering old dinosaur

682
00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:02.581
who doesn't want to die.

683
00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:08.961
Now Pluto and Capricorn's dark face is fascism.

684
00:27:09.083 --> 00:27:14.083
And to pick the brain of the USA chart in particular,

685
00:27:14.448 --> 00:27:16.795
to find out how that would look,

686
00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:19.024
we have to go back to the fact that

687
00:27:19.024 --> 00:27:22.874
Pluto, the planet of raw power,

688
00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:25.850
is in the second house in the USA chart.

689
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.311
The house of money.

690
00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:30.543
Banks and the finance industry.

691
00:27:30.543 --> 00:27:32.324
Now when I say the USA chart

692
00:27:32.324 --> 00:27:34.532
for your viewers who aren't familiar

693
00:27:34.532 --> 00:27:36.228
with this concept,

694
00:27:36.228 --> 00:27:40.761
it's that entity that was born July 4, 1776.

695
00:27:40.761 --> 00:27:42.478
It has a chart too.

696
00:27:42.478 --> 00:27:45.028
And so that is the Sibly chart, as it's known,

697
00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:50.028
is the one that we base our predictions upon.

698
00:27:53.858 --> 00:27:56.270
<v Voiceover>So what happens to those in the middle?</v>

699
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.614
What happens to the middle class

700
00:27:57.614 --> 00:28:00.142
in a time of extreme polarity?

701
00:28:00.142 --> 00:28:01.539
<v ->There's a choice here.</v>

702
00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:04.398
All of these oppositions that I've mentioned

703
00:28:04.398 --> 00:28:06.573
represent a threshold.

704
00:28:06.573 --> 00:28:09.315
There's nothing that the planets do, you know,

705
00:28:09.315 --> 00:28:10.690
in case it doesn't go without saying,

706
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.642
to make things happen,

707
00:28:12.642 --> 00:28:15.405
or to force people to get conscious.

708
00:28:15.405 --> 00:28:17.677
They just are like a clock.

709
00:28:17.677 --> 00:28:19.863
All the planetary cycles are saying,

710
00:28:19.863 --> 00:28:21.132
this is what time it is?

711
00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:22.807
If you're in touch you already knew this.

712
00:28:22.807 --> 00:28:23.532
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

713
00:28:23.532 --> 00:28:28.172
<v ->So in the case of the Saturn/Uranus opposition,</v>

714
00:28:28.172 --> 00:28:33.058
people have this excrutiating sense of

715
00:28:33.058 --> 00:28:36.097
being poised on a threshold.

716
00:28:36.097 --> 00:28:38.209
And this is where the polarization

717
00:28:38.209 --> 00:28:40.086
and the culture wars that you were mentioning

718
00:28:40.086 --> 00:28:42.059
comes in.

719
00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:44.289
It's clear to anybody

720
00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:47.403
that the polarization is as intense as it is,

721
00:28:47.403 --> 00:28:50.997
because we've got some very clear choices here.

722
00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:54.464
The New Yorker magazine spent about five pages

723
00:28:54.464 --> 00:28:59.061
outlining the choices in this coming election.

724
00:28:59.061 --> 00:29:01.514
It's never had such an investment

725
00:29:01.514 --> 00:29:04.789
in any national election that I've ever seen before.

726
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:07.903
So that the stringency and the sense of urgency

727
00:29:07.903 --> 00:29:11.220
about the choice is being brought home.

728
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.759
So, you know, you could say by the sky.

729
00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:16.745
So that individuals can't miss it.

730
00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:21.118
The choice between whatever class you're in

731
00:29:21.118 --> 00:29:23.667
is to wake up to the reality

732
00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:25.694
that's been going on for a while.

733
00:29:25.694 --> 00:29:27.571
Just to wake up to it,

734
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:30.078
and to get into your individuality,

735
00:29:30.078 --> 00:29:33.416
which in astrology translates to

736
00:29:33.416 --> 00:29:35.603
live through your chart.

737
00:29:35.603 --> 00:29:38.621
Go through your own goddess given skills

738
00:29:38.621 --> 00:29:41.224
and potentials, and identify with

739
00:29:41.224 --> 00:29:43.154
your own unique life purpose

740
00:29:43.154 --> 00:29:44.893
to meet the challenge of the times.

741
00:29:44.893 --> 00:29:48.759
That's always the answer in the end.

742
00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:51.612
So we have polarizations

743
00:29:51.612 --> 00:29:56.264
that are being fueled to fever pitch

744
00:29:56.264 --> 00:29:57.821
as we speak.

745
00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:59.655
You know people maybe watching this interview

746
00:29:59.655 --> 00:30:01.842
after the election,

747
00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:04.786
and then the whole deck will be shuffled again

748
00:30:04.786 --> 00:30:06.578
in a different way.

749
00:30:06.578 --> 00:30:09.969
But at the moment what we have is

750
00:30:09.969 --> 00:30:12.241
the polarization's being fanned.

751
00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:14.374
You know this is a bellows.

752
00:30:14.374 --> 00:30:19.374
By the forces really that are pandering to ignorance.

753
00:30:20.742 --> 00:30:22.875
I don't mean to pick on her,

754
00:30:22.875 --> 00:30:27.014
I see all of these candidates as archetypes.

755
00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:29.382
I mean they're not just human beings.

756
00:30:29.382 --> 00:30:33.467
By now they're larger than life mythic figures.

757
00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:34.885
You know this is the way the Jungians

758
00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:37.616
look at people who reach this degree

759
00:30:37.616 --> 00:30:39.290
of prominence in a culture.

760
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.199
They're just projections of the mass mind.

761
00:30:41.199 --> 00:30:41.754
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

762
00:30:41.754 --> 00:30:44.655
<v ->But Sarah Palin is such a blatant one.</v>

763
00:30:44.655 --> 00:30:48.538
And you see by her chart how this came to be.

764
00:30:48.538 --> 00:30:53.538
She's got Neptune on her Sun exactly right now.

765
00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:57.166
And it was within a minute of arc

766
00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:58.841
when she accepted the nomination.

767
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:02.809
So this to astrologers this stunning statement

768
00:31:02.809 --> 00:31:04.995
of the fact that

769
00:31:04.995 --> 00:31:07.246
the Sun is a personification.

770
00:31:07.246 --> 00:31:09.219
The Sun represents that one becomes

771
00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:12.685
a walking embodiment of something.

772
00:31:12.685 --> 00:31:17.485
Neptune is fraud, lies, deceit.

773
00:31:17.485 --> 00:31:21.058
Stuff that's just made up out of faux cloth.

774
00:31:21.058 --> 00:31:23.362
She is a walking embodiment

775
00:31:23.362 --> 00:31:26.893
of a certain type of lie.

776
00:31:26.893 --> 00:31:28.418
And when she,

777
00:31:28.418 --> 00:31:29.858
I mean I'm not really blaming her,

778
00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:32.044
because it's beyond the personal at this point.

779
00:31:32.044 --> 00:31:34.017
It's almost like the cosmos choice her

780
00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:37.569
to be typecast for this role.

781
00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:42.569
And so, she has just as one would expect

782
00:31:42.753 --> 00:31:47.158
enflamed the culture wars right on cue.

783
00:31:47.158 --> 00:31:49.782
And yet the funny thing is that

784
00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:52.523
there's this morality emphasis

785
00:31:52.523 --> 00:31:54.571
that she's been voicing,

786
00:31:54.571 --> 00:31:58.912
which if we follow astrological logic

787
00:31:58.912 --> 00:32:03.392
that belongs to the Pluto and Sagittarius years,

788
00:32:03.392 --> 00:32:07.007
which are coming to a close.

789
00:32:07.007 --> 00:32:09.610
On November 25th, Pluto's not going to go back

790
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.722
into Sagittarius again.

791
00:32:11.722 --> 00:32:12.959
It's been retrograding in and out.

792
00:32:12.959 --> 00:32:13.866
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

793
00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:15.391
<v ->For 250 years.</v>

794
00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:17.321
<v Voiceover>Right, we're solidly in Capricorn.</v>

795
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:21.737
<v ->So what she's enflaming with the religious stuff</v>

796
00:32:21.737 --> 00:32:24.052
and the right/wrong stuff,

797
00:32:24.052 --> 00:32:27.678
and this blinkered tribal nationalism,

798
00:32:27.678 --> 00:32:31.486
my country right or wrong stuff, is over.

799
00:32:31.486 --> 00:32:34.451
So this is another indication.

800
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:36.574
<v Voiceover>Wrong message at the wrong time.</v>

801
00:32:36.574 --> 00:32:39.731
<v ->It's the wrong message for victory.</v>

802
00:32:39.731 --> 00:32:41.864
What we're looking at is you know,

803
00:32:41.864 --> 00:32:45.117
what the sky says is on now.

804
00:32:45.117 --> 00:32:45.992
What's up now.

805
00:32:45.992 --> 00:32:48.434
I mean this is the only morality in astrology is,

806
00:32:48.434 --> 00:32:50.718
are we aligned with what time it is?

807
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:52.691
Or are we not?

808
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:57.261
And what's going on here with nationalism for example,

809
00:32:57.261 --> 00:33:00.600
with Pluto going into Capricorn,

810
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.522
nationalism as we have known it

811
00:33:03.522 --> 00:33:06.146
is going to bite the dust.

812
00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:08.077
It's a very exciting prospect

813
00:33:08.077 --> 00:33:12.396
and also horrifying to a lot of people.

814
00:33:12.396 --> 00:33:15.132
I'll give you an example.

815
00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:20.055
The way that jingoistic points of view,

816
00:33:20.055 --> 00:33:22.892
you know political parties who are into

817
00:33:22.892 --> 00:33:26.646
my borders and this is my country,

818
00:33:26.646 --> 00:33:28.577
and the xenophobic kind of policies

819
00:33:28.577 --> 00:33:30.806
that come off of that,

820
00:33:30.806 --> 00:33:34.358
have always looked at immigration in a certain way.

821
00:33:34.358 --> 00:33:35.680
Oh, those people aren't our people,

822
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.195
they can't even speak our language.

823
00:33:37.195 --> 00:33:40.587
They're coming in to get our jobs.

824
00:33:40.587 --> 00:33:42.529
<v Voiceover>Short memories by the way (laughs).</v>

825
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:43.297
<v ->Yes exactly.</v>

826
00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:44.502
<v Voiceover>For a country like this.</v>

827
00:33:44.502 --> 00:33:46.571
<v ->Exactly, very short memories.</v>

828
00:33:46.571 --> 00:33:49.728
The shortsightedness, the morality aside.

829
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:52.843
The fact is that with Pluto and Capricorn coming in

830
00:33:52.843 --> 00:33:55.979
wiping out the old-fashioned distinctions

831
00:33:55.979 --> 00:34:00.341
between countries, it's going to be a moot point.

832
00:34:00.341 --> 00:34:04.917
The whole idea of immigrants,

833
00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:07.541
it's an anachronistic word even,

834
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:10.719
because these are refugees now.

835
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.927
We could even say

836
00:34:12.927 --> 00:34:17.033
that the economic diaspora we're seeing from

837
00:34:17.033 --> 00:34:18.889
Central and South America,

838
00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.908
cannot be stopped by a wall.

839
00:34:21.908 --> 00:34:24.254
What a cartoon that is.

840
00:34:24.254 --> 00:34:26.387
A literal wall is going to keep them out.

841
00:34:26.387 --> 00:34:28.617
Does anybody really believe that?

842
00:34:28.617 --> 00:34:31.059
We're looking at the force of globalization

843
00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:33.544
creating immense poverty,

844
00:34:33.544 --> 00:34:35.443
and people are going to try to survive.

845
00:34:35.443 --> 00:34:36.979
Human animals do that.

846
00:34:36.979 --> 00:34:37.864
So they're going to go

847
00:34:37.864 --> 00:34:38.771
where every they can.

848
00:34:38.771 --> 00:34:41.554
It's not immigration in the old sense.

849
00:34:41.554 --> 00:34:44.498
So there are a couple of features

850
00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:45.970
which everybody knows.

851
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.498
You don't have to be an astrologer to see

852
00:34:48.498 --> 00:34:51.101
that globalization is the first point

853
00:34:51.101 --> 00:34:53.415
that's created a kind of poverty

854
00:34:53.415 --> 00:34:57.436
in developing countries that we've never seen before.

855
00:34:57.436 --> 00:35:01.009
And now we're going to have global warming,

856
00:35:01.009 --> 00:35:02.406
which is already, you know,

857
00:35:02.406 --> 00:35:04.518
in Peru they can't do the farming techniques

858
00:35:04.518 --> 00:35:07.636
that are millions of years old.

859
00:35:07.636 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Voiceover>Species are fleeing</v>

860
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.766
up the Sierra Nevada as well.

861
00:35:11.766 --> 00:35:14.049
Because the habitat has become warmer

862
00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:15.606
over the last, just couple of decades.

863
00:35:15.606 --> 00:35:16.161
<v ->That's right.</v>

864
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:17.270
I just saw it in the paper this morning,

865
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.134
not just humans.

866
00:35:18.134 --> 00:35:18.870
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

867
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.598
<v ->But they're all moving north.</v>

868
00:35:20.598 --> 00:35:21.334
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

869
00:35:21.334 --> 00:35:24.405
<v ->And literally they're moving geographically north.</v>

870
00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:26.976
If you look at the peoples of Africa,

871
00:35:26.976 --> 00:35:31.976
which are such a tragic example of a

872
00:35:32.242 --> 00:35:36.589
country, different African states for different reasons,

873
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:38.914
are just about broken down.

874
00:35:38.914 --> 00:35:42.306
You know punitively they can call them governments,

875
00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:45.602
but basically there are only a few African states anymore

876
00:35:45.602 --> 00:35:48.012
that have anything that could be construed as a

877
00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:49.708
functioning government.

878
00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:51.652
And you may have heard

879
00:35:51.652 --> 00:35:53.868
the influx into South Africa--

880
00:35:53.868 --> 00:35:54.657
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

881
00:35:54.657 --> 00:35:56.609
<v ->Which is the one state</v>

882
00:35:56.609 --> 00:35:59.905
that has a little bit more function going on.

883
00:35:59.905 --> 00:36:01.484
And the terrible violence

884
00:36:01.484 --> 00:36:05.462
as the South Africans try to keep them out.

885
00:36:05.462 --> 00:36:08.683
It just reminds me of plague victims

886
00:36:08.683 --> 00:36:10.731
coming up in a boat

887
00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:12.843
trying to escape where they're coming from,

888
00:36:12.843 --> 00:36:14.933
and the people with poles on the island

889
00:36:14.933 --> 00:36:17.184
keeping them out.

890
00:36:17.184 --> 00:36:20.202
There's going to be the horror

891
00:36:20.202 --> 00:36:23.296
of diaspora, refugees.

892
00:36:23.296 --> 00:36:25.525
I want to use that old biblical word.

893
00:36:25.525 --> 00:36:27.775
So that we can get away with this

894
00:36:27.775 --> 00:36:30.815
anarchistic thinking that it's really about immigration.

895
00:36:30.815 --> 00:36:32.063
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

896
00:36:32.063 --> 00:36:33.642
<v ->This is a whole new ballgame</v>

897
00:36:33.642 --> 00:36:34.431
based on cataclysm.

898
00:36:34.431 --> 00:36:36.041
<v Voiceover>This is one of desperation.</v>

899
00:36:38.061 --> 00:36:40.911
<v ->And if there's no empathy</v>

900
00:36:40.911 --> 00:36:42.254
there's going to be a breakdown

901
00:36:42.254 --> 00:36:44.900
of a morale humanless.

902
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.596
We can't afford that.

903
00:36:46.596 --> 00:36:48.622
There's enough breakdown already.

904
00:36:48.622 --> 00:36:51.011
So our sights need to be set on

905
00:36:51.011 --> 00:36:54.990
understanding this from the big picture.

906
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.467
I have to say that someone like John McCain,

907
00:36:58.467 --> 00:37:01.859
who was subjected to the kind of

908
00:37:01.859 --> 00:37:04.014
hideous human cruelty that he had

909
00:37:04.014 --> 00:37:05.902
as a prisoner of war,

910
00:37:05.902 --> 00:37:08.184
to now have signed off

911
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:10.371
on the torture.

912
00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:13.336
That he once valiantly opposed.

913
00:37:13.336 --> 00:37:14.594
<v Voiceover>How ironic is that?</v>

914
00:37:14.594 --> 00:37:17.613
<v ->I think there's a case study for us.</v>

915
00:37:17.613 --> 00:37:20.695
I think it's an object lesson for us to see

916
00:37:20.695 --> 00:37:24.140
that when ego triumphs.

917
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.266
Oh he wants to win, so badly.

918
00:37:27.266 --> 00:37:30.337
That one by one he's let all of the

919
00:37:30.337 --> 00:37:32.769
conscious driven stances that he's had,

920
00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:34.167
even his own immigration bill,

921
00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:36.790
he voted against.

922
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:39.851
That we can look at him as what not to do.

923
00:37:39.851 --> 00:37:40.577
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

924
00:37:40.577 --> 00:37:42.177
<v ->That's just an example among many.</v>

925
00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:42.710
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

926
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.056
<v ->Because he's so visible.</v>

927
00:37:45.056 --> 00:37:50.056
It bespeaks a kind of insane lack of empathy

928
00:37:52.512 --> 00:37:56.917
to be talking about closing borders,

929
00:37:56.917 --> 00:38:00.352
when people like from the African tribes

930
00:38:00.352 --> 00:38:02.613
who because of globalization

931
00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.810
cannot feed their families anymore.

932
00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.815
Are seeking to come north

933
00:38:06.815 --> 00:38:09.108
to the northern European countries.

934
00:38:09.108 --> 00:38:10.740
Well even that.

935
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.009
You look at Iceland,

936
00:38:12.009 --> 00:38:14.153
probably the most functional social democracy

937
00:38:14.153 --> 00:38:15.732
in the world,

938
00:38:15.732 --> 00:38:18.356
and how they've been the hardest hit in Europe

939
00:38:18.356 --> 00:38:20.350
because of the economic collapse.

940
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:20.926
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

941
00:38:20.926 --> 00:38:22.302
<v ->So all bets are off.</v>

942
00:38:22.302 --> 00:38:24.339
But the one thing we can be sure of

943
00:38:24.339 --> 00:38:28.702
is that the third world is a bellwether.

944
00:38:28.702 --> 00:38:31.539
People in the developing countries

945
00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:34.205
are like the canary in the mine.

946
00:38:34.205 --> 00:38:38.291
And we must be realistic here

947
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:40.808
in our usually extremely insular little

948
00:38:40.808 --> 00:38:45.586
first world reality, that we are a human family.

949
00:38:45.586 --> 00:38:48.605
This is Neptune and Aquarius at its highest.

950
00:38:48.605 --> 00:38:53.042
This is the meaning of the Age of Aquarius, ultimately.

951
00:38:53.042 --> 00:38:55.730
That few understand that we're all a human family.

952
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.842
Add the Pluto and Capricorn crumbling

953
00:38:57.842 --> 00:39:01.052
of national borders here.

954
00:39:01.052 --> 00:39:04.210
It all is pointing in the same direction.

955
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.991
We're going to have to open up our hearts

956
00:39:05.991 --> 00:39:09.340
and recognize the human species as a family.

957
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.148
<v Voiceover>But as this is just opening up</v>

958
00:39:13.148 --> 00:39:14.278
and being revealed,

959
00:39:14.278 --> 00:39:17.094
the first reaction has been fear and panic.

960
00:39:17.094 --> 00:39:20.347
Now, how do we begin to contend

961
00:39:20.347 --> 00:39:21.851
from your perspective,

962
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:23.174
with the fear and panic.

963
00:39:23.174 --> 00:39:24.774
<v ->It sounds simplistic,</v>

964
00:39:24.774 --> 00:39:27.397
but the biggest and most complete answer

965
00:39:27.397 --> 00:39:30.864
to that question is understanding.

966
00:39:30.864 --> 00:39:33.157
We're up against this polarization

967
00:39:33.157 --> 00:39:36.431
between ignorance here.

968
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:39.589
The Saturn and Gemini symbolizes ignorance,

969
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:42.586
and it started the era as I said a minute ago,

970
00:39:42.586 --> 00:39:45.541
when in 2001 it opposed to Pluto.

971
00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:48.282
So we're up against the idea of ignorance,

972
00:39:48.282 --> 00:39:49.562
and these forces are going to fight

973
00:39:49.562 --> 00:39:51.322
for all they're worth.

974
00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:54.692
The kind of character assassination

975
00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:58.447
and down right lies, let's be honest,

976
00:39:58.447 --> 00:40:00.591
that are going on in the last stages

977
00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:02.606
of this campaign.

978
00:40:02.606 --> 00:40:05.017
Are an example of the forces of

979
00:40:05.017 --> 00:40:07.598
Saturn and Gemini still alive,

980
00:40:07.598 --> 00:40:10.595
fighting for all its worth.

981
00:40:10.595 --> 00:40:14.702
Understanding is the antidote.

982
00:40:14.702 --> 00:40:17.742
To see through fear

983
00:40:17.742 --> 00:40:20.323
you have to self inform.

984
00:40:20.323 --> 00:40:22.317
And that means slowly first of all

985
00:40:22.317 --> 00:40:25.314
backing away from the television.

986
00:40:25.314 --> 00:40:28.034
It means turning off the nonsense

987
00:40:28.034 --> 00:40:30.743
that you get from the mass media.

988
00:40:30.743 --> 00:40:33.997
That's an enormous first step.

989
00:40:33.997 --> 00:40:38.018
Then you start invoking the common sense

990
00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:39.692
that we're all born with.

991
00:40:39.692 --> 00:40:42.732
Astrologers would call this Mercury.

992
00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:46.049
It's an inborn phenomenon.

993
00:40:46.049 --> 00:40:47.350
Nobody has to go get it.

994
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.462
It's there in their chart, you can look it up.

995
00:40:49.462 --> 00:40:51.553
You can see where it's strongest.

996
00:40:51.553 --> 00:40:53.409
And feeding it.

997
00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:57.291
This is to inform with the intelligence

998
00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:59.403
that is everybody's birth right,

999
00:40:59.403 --> 00:41:01.696
about what's really going on.

1000
00:41:01.696 --> 00:41:04.875
This is a huge antidote to fear.

1001
00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:07.082
<v Voiceover>And we're talking from the</v>

1002
00:41:07.082 --> 00:41:09.173
macro to the micro.

1003
00:41:09.173 --> 00:41:11.541
<v ->Yes I'm really encompassing all of those.</v>

1004
00:41:11.541 --> 00:41:15.050
When I think of a person opening the paper

1005
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.279
and saying, "Wow, it's on the front page

1006
00:41:17.279 --> 00:41:20.788
that, you know, right after they got their bailout,

1007
00:41:20.788 --> 00:41:24.713
700 billion, these AIG people went on a

1008
00:41:24.713 --> 00:41:27.284
$400,000 retreat in Southern California."

1009
00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:27.892
Did you read that?

1010
00:41:27.892 --> 00:41:28.489
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1011
00:41:28.489 --> 00:41:30.345
<v ->That doesn't seem right.</v>

1012
00:41:30.345 --> 00:41:33.833
Self informing and then connecting the dots

1013
00:41:33.833 --> 00:41:35.806
is a mercurial function.

1014
00:41:35.806 --> 00:41:37.961
It really cuts through fear.

1015
00:41:37.961 --> 00:41:39.571
Where does it bring us?

1016
00:41:39.571 --> 00:41:42.963
In this case, it would bring us to the

1017
00:41:42.963 --> 00:41:46.301
polar opposite of Saturn, the planet of fear.

1018
00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:49.458
Uranus, which is revolution.

1019
00:41:49.458 --> 00:41:53.053
Now I don't use that word lightly.

1020
00:41:53.053 --> 00:41:55.709
Nor do I necessarily use it literally.

1021
00:41:55.709 --> 00:41:57.650
There are all kinds of revolutions.

1022
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.887
There was a cultural revolution

1023
00:41:58.887 --> 00:42:01.212
the last time Saturn opposed to Uranus,

1024
00:42:01.212 --> 00:42:02.834
that you know, rock music

1025
00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:04.060
could be said to be.

1026
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.895
Have been the main gunner there,

1027
00:42:05.895 --> 00:42:08.497
not bombs and guns.

1028
00:42:08.497 --> 00:42:11.612
There are also other kinds of revolutions.

1029
00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:14.908
If for example, a third party candidate

1030
00:42:14.908 --> 00:42:17.041
who is really a populist,

1031
00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:20.966
Uranus governs populist, grass roots movements.

1032
00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:23.920
We're to come into power and be able to garner

1033
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.491
the people behind them.

1034
00:42:26.491 --> 00:42:28.859
That would be, fear wouldn't have a chance.

1035
00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:29.669
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1036
00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:32.176
<v ->Because you've got the truth of the masses</v>

1037
00:42:32.176 --> 00:42:34.480
finally getting self informed,

1038
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.454
throwing off their sense of powerlessness,

1039
00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:39.568
which is what you do get in dictatorships.

1040
00:42:39.568 --> 00:42:41.915
Corporate dictatorships of the kind

1041
00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:44.720
we have going on here in this country.

1042
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.440
That would be a hell of a way

1043
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.434
to get out of the fear.

1044
00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:51.877
It's exactly what's suppose to happen.

1045
00:42:51.877 --> 00:42:55.450
My feeling is that Uranus is always going to win anyway.

1046
00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.637
Uranus is stronger than fear.

1047
00:42:57.637 --> 00:42:59.162
So people have to gear into it

1048
00:42:59.162 --> 00:43:00.879
and identify with it.

1049
00:43:00.879 --> 00:43:02.234
<v Voiceover>So it really is a,</v>

1050
00:43:02.234 --> 00:43:04.388
geniunely a revolution of consciouness

1051
00:43:04.388 --> 00:43:05.828
that has to occur.

1052
00:43:05.828 --> 00:43:08.985
<v ->It's going to be revolutions on many levels.</v>

1053
00:43:08.985 --> 00:43:10.468
You know the public outrage

1054
00:43:10.468 --> 00:43:15.468
which you know the people started to feel

1055
00:43:16.505 --> 00:43:19.043
when they read that the banks were going to get

1056
00:43:19.043 --> 00:43:20.856
bailed out instead of the homeowners.

1057
00:43:20.856 --> 00:43:22.083
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1058
00:43:22.083 --> 00:43:23.683
<v ->You know it was only Cindy Sheehan</v>

1059
00:43:23.683 --> 00:43:25.848
who had the guts to say,

1060
00:43:25.848 --> 00:43:27.683
"Why don't we just have a moratorium

1061
00:43:27.683 --> 00:43:29.933
on foreclosures, can't we start there?"

1062
00:43:29.933 --> 00:43:30.882
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1063
00:43:30.882 --> 00:43:33.880
<v ->Well there was so many thousands of people</v>

1064
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.064
who signed those petitions

1065
00:43:35.064 --> 00:43:36.130
right after the bailout--

1066
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:36.759
<v Voiceover>Oh yeah.</v>

1067
00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:40.354
<v ->Was proposed, that I think it surprised everybody.</v>

1068
00:43:40.354 --> 00:43:43.628
And it did work, at least for a little bit.

1069
00:43:43.628 --> 00:43:48.012
When the House followed their constituents.

1070
00:43:48.012 --> 00:43:48.919
Later they caved.

1071
00:43:48.919 --> 00:43:49.740
<v Voiceover>Well they were strong armed.</v>

1072
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.982
<v ->It was really very clear that</v>

1073
00:43:52.982 --> 00:43:54.614
the force of the people

1074
00:43:54.614 --> 00:43:57.025
is something to contend with.

1075
00:43:57.025 --> 00:43:57.889
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1076
00:43:57.889 --> 00:43:59.787
<v ->That's Uranus.</v>

1077
00:43:59.787 --> 00:44:02.017
<v Voiceover>So how do you feel right now,</v>

1078
00:44:02.017 --> 00:44:03.179
sitting where we are,

1079
00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:05.110
the elections a few weeks off.

1080
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.075
The crumbling of the old structures

1081
00:44:08.075 --> 00:44:10.720
have already begun economically.

1082
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.864
If you were going to give us a snapshot

1083
00:44:12.864 --> 00:44:14.954
of your view in say,

1084
00:44:14.954 --> 00:44:16.341
what it's going to look like at large

1085
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:19.157
in a couple years time?

1086
00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:21.567
<v ->Systems collapse.</v>

1087
00:44:21.567 --> 00:44:25.844
And as a sociologist would equally say,

1088
00:44:25.844 --> 00:44:28.511
or a global warming expert,

1089
00:44:28.511 --> 00:44:33.511
or, you know, a person who looks

1090
00:44:33.545 --> 00:44:37.726
at international systems from a distance,

1091
00:44:37.726 --> 00:44:41.118
I would look at what's going on in Africa

1092
00:44:41.118 --> 00:44:43.881
as the unfortunate paradigm

1093
00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:47.059
for what will sooner or later reach our shores.

1094
00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:51.475
Unless there are ingenious,

1095
00:44:51.475 --> 00:44:53.288
not just smart,

1096
00:44:53.288 --> 00:44:57.555
but innovative, ingenious solutions immediately

1097
00:44:57.555 --> 00:44:59.528
put into place,

1098
00:44:59.528 --> 00:45:02.920
by people of tremendous morale courage.

1099
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.637
But the fact is,

1100
00:45:04.637 --> 00:45:06.653
this grand cross in leadership signs

1101
00:45:06.653 --> 00:45:08.327
we're talking about,

1102
00:45:08.327 --> 00:45:12.156
gives the green light to exactly that.

1103
00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:14.300
I mean it's as powerful and as stringent

1104
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.732
as it is, these configurations

1105
00:45:16.732 --> 00:45:18.684
that are building up there.

1106
00:45:18.684 --> 00:45:21.660
For the sake of creating exactly that

1107
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.772
kind of ingenuity.

1108
00:45:23.772 --> 00:45:27.857
So the extreme of social change

1109
00:45:27.857 --> 00:45:30.246
could happen very rapidly,

1110
00:45:30.246 --> 00:45:31.782
cataclysmically rapidly,

1111
00:45:31.782 --> 00:45:36.782
to meet the dystopian potentials

1112
00:45:37.147 --> 00:45:40.485
that we all know exist, is there.

1113
00:45:40.485 --> 00:45:43.344
It's a little bit unfair in a way

1114
00:45:43.344 --> 00:45:45.850
asking an astrologer to answer

1115
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.408
a question on that human level,

1116
00:45:47.408 --> 00:45:51.983
because I see things in terms of natural law.

1117
00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:54.970
I see it as utterly organic

1118
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:58.383
that for example the dinosaurs had to go

1119
00:45:58.383 --> 00:46:02.916
and seed the way to other types of mammals.

1120
00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:06.958
I mean I see it as nature just doing her thing,

1121
00:46:06.958 --> 00:46:10.606
that a certain empire is starting to crash and burn,

1122
00:46:10.606 --> 00:46:12.227
just like Rome's did,

1123
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:14.105
when it got to decadent.

1124
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:16.920
When it started being eaten alive

1125
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.374
by its own karma.

1126
00:46:19.374 --> 00:46:20.675
I do have the distance,

1127
00:46:20.675 --> 00:46:22.701
anybody does when they look at things

1128
00:46:22.701 --> 00:46:27.320
from macrocyclic perspective,

1129
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.221
to not feel horrified,

1130
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:33.197
even when I'm looking at horrors.

1131
00:46:33.197 --> 00:46:35.725
And I think that that's the way that,

1132
00:46:35.725 --> 00:46:36.823
whether it's through astrology

1133
00:46:36.823 --> 00:46:39.138
or some other means,

1134
00:46:39.138 --> 00:46:42.466
that people are going to keep their sanity.

1135
00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:46.892
Finding, call it a spiritual perspective, to use,

1136
00:46:46.892 --> 00:46:50.049
to keep the big picture in mind.

1137
00:46:50.049 --> 00:46:52.513
And to remember ultimately

1138
00:46:52.513 --> 00:46:55.435
I mean this is a leap of faith but

1139
00:46:55.435 --> 00:46:59.296
this is the one I'm advocating.

1140
00:46:59.296 --> 00:47:03.127
We were all born into this time for a reason.

1141
00:47:03.127 --> 00:47:05.473
Our souls knew that it wasn't going to be

1142
00:47:05.473 --> 00:47:10.473
gambling through the daisies and drinking tea all day.

1143
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:12.875
Something in our DNA,

1144
00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:17.875
call it a super conscious, call it past life mandate,

1145
00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.536
however you configure it.

1146
00:47:21.536 --> 00:47:24.043
On a soul level we knew

1147
00:47:24.043 --> 00:47:26.922
that we were going to be alive now.

1148
00:47:26.922 --> 00:47:31.193
And that we wanted to be.

1149
00:47:32.223 --> 00:47:35.673
<v Voiceover>Any other final thoughts?</v>

1150
00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:39.882
<v ->I say step up to the plate to everybody.</v>

1151
00:47:39.882 --> 00:47:41.876
There's nothing that we're going to get,

1152
00:47:41.876 --> 00:47:44.809
even though it's so staggeringly awful

1153
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:46.825
when you think about it

1154
00:47:46.825 --> 00:47:48.425
in a limited point of view

1155
00:47:48.425 --> 00:47:50.697
that you can barely think about it.

1156
00:47:50.697 --> 00:47:51.881
Still it remains true

1157
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:54.505
that there's nothing that we're going to get

1158
00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:57.086
that we don't have the equipment to cope with.

1159
00:47:57.086 --> 00:48:02.086
Moreover, to flower, to blossom in these times.

1160
00:48:03.795 --> 00:48:07.656
It took a lot of courage for those of us alive now

1161
00:48:07.656 --> 00:48:10.088
to incarnate when we did.

1162
00:48:10.088 --> 00:48:12.136
And we could come into our glory

1163
00:48:12.136 --> 00:48:14.322
if we remember that.

1164
00:48:14.322 --> 00:48:15.645
(soft music)

1165
00:48:15.645 --> 00:48:18.013
<v ->To learn more about this major transition period</v>

1166
00:48:18.013 --> 00:48:20.498
that the United States and by extension

1167
00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:22.812
much of the rest of the world is experiencing,

1168
00:48:22.812 --> 00:48:25.788
pick up a copy of Jessica's book Soul Sick Nation,

1169
00:48:25.788 --> 00:48:28.039
An Astrologer's View of America.

1170
00:48:28.039 --> 00:48:30.876
It's available on her site at mothersky.com

1171
00:48:30.876 --> 00:48:33.244
or through Amazon and other booksellers.

1172
00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:36.006
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
