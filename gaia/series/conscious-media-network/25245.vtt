00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:05.031
(soft music)

2
00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:14.624
<v ->After two decades of enthralling readers</v>

3
00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:18.100
with his scientific investigations on ancient civilizations,

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.256
Graham Hancock expanded his writings

5
00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:21.847
into consciousness itself,

6
00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:24.137
when he debuted his book, Supernatural.

7
00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:26.336
We spoke of this in our past interview.

8
00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.178
In this conversation, we addressed

9
00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.665
his first work of fiction, Entangled.

10
00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.696
In this fast-paced story of the lives of two women

11
00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:36.084
who become entangled through time and space

12
00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:38.536
over a span of 24,000 years,

13
00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:40.648
Graham says he put all of the principles

14
00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:43.976
of quantum physics and consciousness that he holds dear

15
00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.880
into a compelling story,

16
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.410
bypassing the world of academic review.

17
00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:54.530 line:15% 
(soft music)

18
00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.543
I'm so glad to speak with you again.

19
00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:06.527
We're here just a few days after the release

20
00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:08.360
of your newest book, Entangled.

21
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.882
And I've got to tell you, I couldn't even find one.

22
00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:13.847
I went to Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders,

23
00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.555
the local bookstores, and they said,

24
00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:16.579
"Oh we're sold..."

25
00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:17.898
"Oh actually, we don't have it yet,

26
00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:19.518
but the reviews are great!"

27
00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:22.206
So, before we get into that book, which it

28
00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:25.331
really starts tying together so much of what you

29
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:27.355
have learned throughout your lifetime,

30
00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.006
extraordinary things.

31
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:29.996
I thought we'd start back

32
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.731
a little bit on the evolution of your own consciousness

33
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.203
because sovereignty of mind seems to be

34
00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:36.156
your life, your theme, your exploration.

35
00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:37.427
<v ->It's a key issue for me, yeah.</v>

36
00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:38.293
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

37
00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:40.319
<v Regina>And when you started out, I mean out of college,</v>

38
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.748
you ended up a travel writer first,

39
00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:44.372
so your mind was already kind of edgy and

40
00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:46.163
needed to bust out a bit and go.

41
00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:47.591
Talk about what happened.

42
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:51.007
<v ->Well you know, I was a journalist, actually.</v>

43
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.075
I was based in East Africa.

44
00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:56.167
I was the East Africa correspondent for The Economist.

45
00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:58.259
I was travelling widely throughout the

46
00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.943
East Africa region.

47
00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:01.927
And I would say, we're talking late 70s,

48
00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:04.713
early 1980s here, that my mind was very much

49
00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:06.559
you know, rooted and grounded

50
00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.029
in current affairs and the every day world.

51
00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.663
And really, the first, you know, hint

52
00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:15.667
that I was going to change direction

53
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.035
was when I came across Ethiopia's

54
00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:19.679
extraordinary claim, to possess the

55
00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.171
lost Ark of the Covenant,

56
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:23.967
and felt that this was a story worth investigating.

57
00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:27.103
And that drew me in over a period of years.

58
00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:28.659
Ultimately, I wrote a book about it

59
00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.622
called The Sign of the Seal, but it drew me in

60
00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:34.270
over a period of years, into ancient mysteries

61
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.550
and ancient spirituality.

62
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.518
And pretty soon, I found myself exposed to

63
00:02:39.518 --> 00:02:44.518
ancient Egypt, and to the sacred texts of ancient Egypt,

64
00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:49.266
and the deep exploration of the mystery of reality,

65
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:50.546
which the ancient Egyptians were

66
00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:52.338
undoubtedly involved with.

67
00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:56.838
And I began to realize that our society today

68
00:02:56.838 --> 00:03:01.490
really has no answers to offer

69
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.030
on the fundamental mysteries of life.

70
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.338
We're very good with, you know, technology

71
00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:12.286
and making things and fixing things,

72
00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:15.186
but when it comes to, why am I here?

73
00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:16.402
What is my purpose?

74
00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:18.622
Where do I come from?

75
00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:21.054
What happens to me after I die?

76
00:03:21.054 --> 00:03:23.230
Our society has no answers at all.

77
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.002
Or if it does have answers, they're profoundly

78
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.901
unnourishing at a spiritual level.

79
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:30.778
Whereas the ancient Egyptians put their

80
00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:33.914
best minds to work for 3,000 years on these mysteries.

81
00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:37.530
And they have very deep, well thought out answers.

82
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.804
And I found myself drawn in to this.

83
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.298
It was clear that the ancient Egyptians

84
00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:45.220
did not believe that on physical death,

85
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.492
our consciousness also dies.

86
00:03:47.492 --> 00:03:50.030
That they rather felt that consciousness

87
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.046
incarnated in the physical form, but that

88
00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:55.225
consciousness was eternal, or potentially eternal.

89
00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:58.201
And the physical form was a learning experience,

90
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:01.176
and an opportunity to make choices,

91
00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:03.608
either for good or for evil.

92
00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.635
So I guess that was the first time that I really

93
00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:06.669
got exposed to the...

94
00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.184
You know, we take it for granted

95
00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:09.880
in our society, that consciousness is

96
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.130
something that's generated by the brain,

97
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.285
the way a factory makes cars.

98
00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:15.821
But actually, there's no, you know,

99
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.165
there's no proof of that.

100
00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:19.980
But from that deeply embedded, I would say,

101
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.628
reductionalist, materialist, scientific notion,

102
00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:26.391
comes the sense that many people have,

103
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.225
that there cannot possibly be any such thing

104
00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:29.665
as life after death.

105
00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.148
How could anybody have, for example,

106
00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:32.961
a near death experience?

107
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:36.043
How could anybody have an out of body experience?

108
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.134
If our unconsciousness is entirely generated,

109
00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:40.523
an artifact of the body.

110
00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:44.032
And yet, there are all of these anomalies

111
00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:45.888
which need to be explained,

112
00:04:45.888 --> 00:04:50.888
and that's why I felt that this exposure

113
00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:53.269
to the deep thinking of the ancient Egyptians

114
00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:56.405
really opened my mind to all kinds

115
00:04:56.405 --> 00:04:59.679
of extraordinary and amazing possibilities,

116
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.026
and filled me with a thirst for deeper knowledge

117
00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:03.679
on these subjects.

118
00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:05.652
<v Regina>And even in the world of science,</v>

119
00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:07.530
the quantum sciences are now showing

120
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.484
that mind is not limited to the brain,

121
00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:11.668
to the grey matter.

122
00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:12.560
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

123
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.004
<v Regina>And we're starting to look</v>

124
00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:14.188
at the notion of memory.

125
00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:15.585
Where does memory come from?

126
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:18.700
It's not necessarily enclosed within the brain.

127
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.489
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

128
00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:22.059
<v Regina>So it is being explored, thank god.</v>

129
00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.763
<v ->Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:22.763 --> 00:05:25.152
<v Regina>But you were on it 25, 30 years ago,</v>

131
00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:26.848
already beginning your own exploration

132
00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:27.819
through the ancients.

133
00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:28.288
<v ->Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:28.288 --> 00:05:29.515
<v Regina>And this seems to be a theme</v>

135
00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:30.443
that has gone through it.

136
00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:31.904
I kind of joined in with you once

137
00:05:31.904 --> 00:05:34.763
Fingerprints of the Gods came out, which was later.

138
00:05:34.763 --> 00:05:35.968
That was what, 15 years ago?

139
00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.066
<v ->It was '95.</v>

140
00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:38.080
Yeah, 15 years ago.

141
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.178
<v Regina>Yeah, about 15 years ago.</v>

142
00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:42.147
And I found that just absolutely,

143
00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:44.885
I was spell-bound by it at the time.

144
00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:45.461
<v ->Thank you.</v>

145
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.413
<v Regina>Because I didn't really have a context</v>

146
00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.130
to put these things that I had learned about

147
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.293
through esoteric channels--

148
00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:50.783
<v ->Yeah.</v>

149
00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.322
<v Regina>Out there to people without being ridiculed.</v>

150
00:05:53.322 --> 00:05:55.733
And you really have done a great deal

151
00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:58.900
to serve as a resource and aid

152
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.590
for people who want to articulate some of these themes.

153
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.907
<v ->Well see, that was the other side of my nature</v>

154
00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:05.952
and my experience.

155
00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:10.112
That to these esoteric and mysterious themes,

156
00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:14.151
I could bring a very grounded research discipline,

157
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:18.080
and present the information in such a way

158
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.149
that even extreme skeptics would be obliged

159
00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.959
to at least--

160
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.794
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Graham>Consider it.</v>

161
00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:23.562
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

162
00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:27.039
<v ->Rather than just dismissing it out of hand.</v>

163
00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.874
And I would say that that's been

164
00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:31.657
a theme of my work all along,

165
00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:35.892
to venture into areas of mystery and areas

166
00:06:35.892 --> 00:06:37.577
of the extraordinary.

167
00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:40.649
But also, to bring some kind of

168
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:45.449
serious rigor to the exploration that I had to take.

169
00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.400
And that's why, it's why I always feel that

170
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.006
I shouldn't really be writing about something

171
00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:53.395
unless I have some personal experience

172
00:06:53.395 --> 00:06:55.347
of what I'm writing about.

173
00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:56.627
I'm not an armchair author.

174
00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:57.576
I have to get out there.

175
00:06:57.576 --> 00:06:59.133
I have to investigate.

176
00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:02.056
And that was clearly reflected in the six years

177
00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.733
of diving that I and my wife, Santhia,

178
00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:07.357
who's a photographer, did in order to

179
00:07:07.357 --> 00:07:10.834
substantiate the stories of ruined structures--

180
00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:11.580
<v Regina>And underworld.</v>

181
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.554
<v ->Underwater, this was our book.</v>

182
00:07:13.554 --> 00:07:15.943
Underworld, that I put myself into.

183
00:07:15.943 --> 00:07:18.780
And it came the same as, really, as I reached

184
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.862
the end of that investigation and felt that

185
00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:24.902
I had come to a point where I'd said

186
00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:28.251
as much as I wanted to say about the possibility

187
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.990
of a lost civilization.

188
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.174
I'd walked the walk.

189
00:07:31.174 --> 00:07:33.051
I had put the information out there.

190
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.096
I had taken the risks.

191
00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:36.379
I'd put 20 years of my life into this.

192
00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.139
I found that what was drawing me

193
00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.648
more and more, was the mystery of consciousness

194
00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:44.869
and the miracle and the mystery of consciousness,

195
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:46.362
of human consciousness.

196
00:07:46.362 --> 00:07:49.125
And that's why I then got into the investigation

197
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.301
of my last non-fiction book,

198
00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:54.714
which is called Supernatural, and which took me

199
00:07:54.714 --> 00:07:57.529
into realms of shamanism and

200
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:58.969
altered states of consciousness.

201
00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:01.551
You know, it's interesting that in the West,

202
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:05.263
if you go back to the 1950s and 1960s

203
00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:07.588
before the so called war on drugs bore down

204
00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:10.169
on all kinds of interesting research.

205
00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:12.366
There was some very important research being done

206
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:15.950
into consciousness, using psychedelics.

207
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.475
<v Regina>Stanley Grof and a number of people.</v>

208
00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:18.403
<v ->Exactly.</v>

209
00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:19.502
Very, very important work.

210
00:08:19.502 --> 00:08:22.744
And it was beginning to yield insights

211
00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:24.398
into the mysterious nature of consciousness.

212
00:08:24.398 --> 00:08:26.947
Because consciousness is just one of those subjects that,

213
00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:29.549
any honest scientist will have to admit

214
00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:31.010
that they don't understand.

215
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.869
They don't understand how this few pounds of jelly

216
00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:38.189
inside our skulls can yield emotions,

217
00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:42.722
feelings of love, appreciation of music or of a sunset.

218
00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.620
How do we understand that this

219
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.521
physical object is capable of those kinds

220
00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:49.335
of sensations and emotions?

221
00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:52.140
And science cannot explain this.

222
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.830
And I got very interested in the research that

223
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.857
had been done into altered states of consciousness.

224
00:08:57.857 --> 00:09:02.294
And also, the way to follow this practically for me,

225
00:09:02.294 --> 00:09:03.958
was to work with shamans

226
00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.910
in tribal and hunter-gatherer societies,

227
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.584
who are also very much in the business

228
00:09:07.584 --> 00:09:09.973
of exploring altered states of consciousness.

229
00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:13.088
Shamanism is all about altered states of consciousness.

230
00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:15.296
And that involved going down to the Amazon

231
00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:18.751
and drinking this mysterious South American brew,

232
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:22.559
ayahuasca, with shamans in the Amazon,

233
00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:25.738
and experiencing visionary journeys for myself.

234
00:09:25.738 --> 00:09:27.786
And that's when, you know, what I'd understood

235
00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:30.356
theoretically and emotionally,

236
00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:32.895
since I became involved with the ancient Egyptian text,

237
00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:34.793
was really brought home to me

238
00:09:34.793 --> 00:09:37.886
at the level of direct personal experience.

239
00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:42.878
That we may be surrounded by and interpenetrated by

240
00:09:42.878 --> 00:09:47.006
a vast, invisible reality which is not

241
00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:49.544
normally accessible to our senses.

242
00:09:49.544 --> 00:09:51.837
But that it's possible to adjust

243
00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:54.813
the receiver wavelength of the brain

244
00:09:54.813 --> 00:09:56.712
through certain shamanistic techniques,

245
00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:59.485
which include the consumption of visionary plants,

246
00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:02.738
but is not, by any means, limited to those techniques.

247
00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:06.354
And perhaps gain access to what quantum physicists

248
00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:08.050
might call parallel worlds.

249
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.909
For shamans, it's the spirit world and spirit realms.

250
00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:12.807
I think quantum physicists are talking about

251
00:10:12.807 --> 00:10:14.183
the same thing when they talk about

252
00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:15.367
parallel realms and dimensions.

253
00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:16.060
<v Regina>Well, they are.</v>

254
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.383
And you know, The Monroe Institute,

255
00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:20.124
Tom Campbell's work and all the experiments they did.

256
00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:22.374
You know, years, you're talking 20, 30 years ago.

257
00:10:22.374 --> 00:10:23.814
Out of body experiences, which we'll get

258
00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:25.308
into a little bit.

259
00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.326
They were already starting to validate in

260
00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:31.526
scientific manner, I mean that was the point at the time,

261
00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:34.705
that these parallel realities existed,

262
00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:36.166
especially when he and his partner, Dennis,

263
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:37.841
would go out and be instructed,

264
00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:39.142
"You're going to meet somewhere beyond this

265
00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:41.510
dimensional field and report back."

266
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.345
And it was, they were in the same place together.

267
00:10:43.345 --> 00:10:43.814
<v ->Yes.</v>

268
00:10:43.814 --> 00:10:46.395
<v Regina>But, certainly along the way, this was never</v>

269
00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:47.579
lost on the military.

270
00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:48.288
<v ->No.</v>

271
00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:48.770
<v Regina>They've been right</v>

272
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.015
at the leading edge of consciousness.

273
00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:51.495
<v ->Yes.</v>

274
00:10:51.495 --> 00:10:54.194
<v Regina>You've heard, in fact,</v>

275
00:10:54.194 --> 00:10:56.028
our friends that are watching this right now,

276
00:10:56.028 --> 00:10:58.652
many have already explored some of those

277
00:10:58.652 --> 00:11:00.572
studies and such that have gone on.

278
00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:01.926
Some of those projects,

279
00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:04.081
a lot of them really dastardly in nature.

280
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:06.385
So there's no doubt that the study

281
00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:08.518
of altered states of consciousness

282
00:11:08.518 --> 00:11:11.163
and parallel worlds has been done.

283
00:11:11.163 --> 00:11:13.904
But it kept either being suppressed by the military,

284
00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:14.534
<v ->Yes.</v>

285
00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:15.696
<v Regina>Or a giggle factor on it.</v>

286
00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:16.709
<v ->Yeah, that's right.</v>

287
00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:17.637
<v Regina>And once again,</v>

288
00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:19.803
you're trying to take this information

289
00:11:19.803 --> 00:11:22.266
into an understandable framework

290
00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:23.514
that doesn't frighten people,

291
00:11:23.514 --> 00:11:24.976
but actually opens possibilities.

292
00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.490
<v ->Very much so.</v>

293
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.967
And, you know, to try to

294
00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:34.106
shake us out of this unproven notion

295
00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:35.983
that consciousness is simply

296
00:11:35.983 --> 00:11:39.097
an accidental byproduct of brain activity.

297
00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:41.839
Which is the notion that most scientists go with.

298
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:45.134
And the unproven notion, in fact the religious faith,

299
00:11:45.134 --> 00:11:46.948
that many scientists express

300
00:11:46.948 --> 00:11:48.686
that there is no life after death.

301
00:11:48.686 --> 00:11:49.827
That is not a fact.

302
00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:51.193
That is not a scientific fact.

303
00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:52.889
There is no evidence for that proposition.

304
00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:54.115
But many scientists will tell you

305
00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:55.118
that that's the case.

306
00:11:55.118 --> 00:11:57.368
And because they're Dr. X or Professor Y,

307
00:11:57.368 --> 00:12:00.461
a lot of us unfortunately believe them.

308
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:04.451
And really resist any further exploration

309
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.490
of the mystery, or trying to find out

310
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.558
what is going on here.

311
00:12:10.558 --> 00:12:11.939
<v Regina>The cultural conditioning.</v>

312
00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:13.304
Nobody wants to be laughed at.

313
00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:13.816
<v ->Yeah.</v>

314
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.365
So I want to give the other side of the story,

315
00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:18.946
and show that there really is an enormous

316
00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:20.525
mystery here.

317
00:12:20.525 --> 00:12:24.866
And that one of the very interesting things

318
00:12:24.866 --> 00:12:27.394
about the visionary plants like ayahuasca

319
00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.207
and about the psychedelics,

320
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:32.556
is that they can be used to alter consciousness

321
00:12:32.556 --> 00:12:34.953
in a targeted way.

322
00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:38.146
And this can actually be switched on or off

323
00:12:38.146 --> 00:12:39.543
pretty much at will.

324
00:12:39.543 --> 00:12:41.399
So it then becomes impossible to do,

325
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:43.767
sorry because possible, highly possible

326
00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:45.367
to do scientific work

327
00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:47.414
with altered states of consciousness,

328
00:12:47.414 --> 00:12:49.644
and see where it takes us.

329
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.358
And you were mentioning

330
00:12:50.358 --> 00:12:51.980
meeting on the other side.

331
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.931
Well shamans do this all the time.

332
00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:55.233
Because they are masters of this

333
00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:56.790
quote/unquote technology,

334
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.094
of this psychic technology.

335
00:12:59.094 --> 00:13:03.040
They are not lost or disoriented

336
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.152
in the other world.

337
00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.403
They are together and organized,

338
00:13:07.403 --> 00:13:09.002
and can meet other shamans

339
00:13:09.002 --> 00:13:09.909
on the other side.

340
00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:10.378
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

341
00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:12.554
<v ->And carry out activities that are of use</v>

342
00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:13.877
to their people.

343
00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.850
Because of course what shamans know

344
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.986
is that we are involved with the

345
00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:20.842
quote/unquote supernatural.

346
00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.260
Whether we like it or not.

347
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.351
It's just there.

348
00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:28.553
And if we really want to understand

349
00:13:28.553 --> 00:13:31.294
problems in our everyday world,

350
00:13:31.294 --> 00:13:33.449
we also need to consider the possibility

351
00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:35.731
that they may have spiritual origins,

352
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.374
which need to addressed,

353
00:13:37.374 --> 00:13:40.627
as well as their physical and material manifestations

354
00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:42.344
in this realm.

355
00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:43.326
<v Regina>That's interesting,</v>

356
00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:45.459
because you're also talking about...

357
00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:46.941
A lot of people I notice

358
00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:49.149
in the last few years in particular,

359
00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:50.098
although the world of science

360
00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:53.159
has not caught up and will not catch up on this one.

361
00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:54.002
And that is something

362
00:13:54.002 --> 00:13:55.132
that each one of us owns,

363
00:13:55.132 --> 00:13:57.041
and that's the ability to go into dream time.

364
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:57.617
<v ->Yeah.</v>

365
00:13:57.617 --> 00:13:59.548
<v Regina>Where we do go through this process of</v>

366
00:13:59.548 --> 00:14:01.724
evacuating, leaving the body

367
00:14:01.724 --> 00:14:04.262
and having other experiences in other dimensions.

368
00:14:04.262 --> 00:14:06.076
Most of which we put in a junk basket

369
00:14:06.076 --> 00:14:07.537
called crazy dreams.

370
00:14:07.537 --> 00:14:09.691
But that's only because the mind

371
00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:10.481
doesn't have the means

372
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:12.454
of necessarily interpreting at times

373
00:14:12.454 --> 00:14:14.406
what's happening beyond the veil,

374
00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:16.752
as we are out at that time.

375
00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:18.373
While our body's sleeping.

376
00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:19.995
And so here the shamans too,

377
00:14:19.995 --> 00:14:21.691
they dream together.

378
00:14:22.581 --> 00:14:23.687
Just as an aside,

379
00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:26.012
have you played a little bit with dreams at all

380
00:14:26.012 --> 00:14:27.335
and what's happening in dream time

381
00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:28.540
amidst all this?

382
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.233
<v ->Yeah.</v>

383
00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:32.465
I'm very interested in this issue.

384
00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:34.300
And again, first of all we're up against

385
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.433
a prejudice in our society.

386
00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:37.297
In fact one of the ways

387
00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:38.897
you can insult somebody in our society

388
00:14:38.897 --> 00:14:40.102
is to call them a dreamer.

389
00:14:40.102 --> 00:14:40.593
<v Regina>Right.</v>

390
00:14:40.593 --> 00:14:41.521
Isn't that sad?

391
00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:43.281
<v ->It's really sad.</v>

392
00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:45.072
And in ancient times,

393
00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:47.878
when they had far greater wisdom,

394
00:14:47.878 --> 00:14:49.606
and far greater knowledge on these matters

395
00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:51.205
than we do.

396
00:14:51.205 --> 00:14:55.098
Dreaming was regarded as a very valid means

397
00:14:55.098 --> 00:14:56.357
of gaining knowledge.

398
00:14:56.357 --> 00:14:57.396
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

399
00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.333
<v ->Not all dreams, not all the time.</v>

400
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.815
But some dreams

401
00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:05.626
could be a very specific targeted way

402
00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:07.524
of gaining valid knowledge,

403
00:15:07.524 --> 00:15:09.871
which otherwise might not be available to us.

404
00:15:09.871 --> 00:15:12.281
So added to the armory of tools

405
00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:14.233
for understanding our predicament,

406
00:15:14.233 --> 00:15:16.718
dreams were an important element.

407
00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:18.532
And I think we need to return to that.

408
00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:20.484
I think we need to return to seeing,

409
00:15:20.484 --> 00:15:22.158
instead of just dismissing them

410
00:15:22.158 --> 00:15:23.939
as complete nonsense,

411
00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:25.518
to realize that something very profound

412
00:15:25.518 --> 00:15:26.403
may be going on.

413
00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:27.096
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

414
00:15:27.096 --> 00:15:29.486
And I think it's the Arlington Institute.

415
00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:30.371
Have you heard of that?

416
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:31.064
<v ->No, I haven't</v>

417
00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:32.877
<v Regina>I think it's called the Arlington Institute,</v>

418
00:15:32.877 --> 00:15:34.435
and I've been meaning to get around to it.

419
00:15:34.435 --> 00:15:35.949
Just haven't yet.

420
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:38.776
But they were, a year or two ago as I recall,

421
00:15:38.776 --> 00:15:41.730
they were eliciting from the population at large

422
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.789
their prominent dreams.

423
00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.367
And they were going to start cataloguing

424
00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:47.853
and looking at emerging themes,

425
00:15:47.853 --> 00:15:50.893
much as Cliff Hyde through linguistics.

426
00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:51.458
<v ->Yeah.</v>

427
00:15:51.458 --> 00:15:53.751
<v Regina>Or Gerald Celente does through his</v>

428
00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:57.772
system of evaluation of 91 different, you know, phenomena.

429
00:15:57.772 --> 00:15:59.724
And I thought that was really fascinating--

430
00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:00.204
<v ->Yeah.</v>

431
00:16:00.204 --> 00:16:00.898
<v Regina>Because it was finally being taken--</v>

432
00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:01.944
<v Regina>seriously.</v>
<v Graham>It is.</v>

433
00:16:01.944 --> 00:16:02.946
<v ->Well again it's the kind of research</v>

434
00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:04.343
that needs to be done.

435
00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:07.031
Because from that we can extract

436
00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:09.122
incredibly useful information.

437
00:16:09.122 --> 00:16:10.231
I see this again and again

438
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:12.684
in Western technological society.

439
00:16:12.684 --> 00:16:14.465
We are what we are.

440
00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:15.628
We can't go back.

441
00:16:15.628 --> 00:16:17.164
We can't become hunter/gatherers

442
00:16:17.164 --> 00:16:21.036
or, you know, tribal people again.

443
00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:22.732
And really what's needed

444
00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.598
is a new kind of shamanism,

445
00:16:24.598 --> 00:16:27.041
that is appropriate to the Western context.

446
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:27.734
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

447
00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:28.907
<v ->And to the Western model.</v>

448
00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:30.742
And which allows the investigation

449
00:16:30.742 --> 00:16:32.992
of all these other areas of experience

450
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.800
that Western society has prematurely dismissed

451
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.607
<v Graham>as unimportant.</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

452
00:16:39.607 --> 00:16:41.611
<v ->And so I would very much like to see</v>

453
00:16:41.611 --> 00:16:44.533
a massive study of dreams,

454
00:16:44.533 --> 00:16:46.698
and looking for common themes in those.

455
00:16:46.698 --> 00:16:48.832
Because we might get warning,

456
00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:50.133
we might get information

457
00:16:50.133 --> 00:16:51.221
of something very dangerous

458
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:52.661
coming down the line,

459
00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:55.285
which we could gain access to in that way.

460
00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:55.914
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

461
00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:57.844
I mean it's known, that after the fact anyway,

462
00:16:57.844 --> 00:16:59.978
many people say, "Oh my God, I just had a dream of that."

463
00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.090
I had that one, there was one of the missiles

464
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.735
that exploded, Vandenberg Air Force base

465
00:17:04.735 --> 00:17:05.855
a number of years ago.

466
00:17:05.855 --> 00:17:07.806
I woke up dreaming of a missile exploding

467
00:17:07.806 --> 00:17:09.129
in southern California.

468
00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.889
And this is happening with thousands of people

469
00:17:10.889 --> 00:17:11.817
at the same moment.

470
00:17:11.817 --> 00:17:12.702
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

471
00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:14.142
<v Regina>It's just that it hasn't really been catalogued.</v>

472
00:17:14.142 --> 00:17:16.574
If people had a place to register

473
00:17:16.574 --> 00:17:18.387
that kind of dream when it happens,

474
00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:21.267
especially what feels like a precognitive,

475
00:17:21.267 --> 00:17:22.913
substantial dream.

476
00:17:22.913 --> 00:17:24.381
It's amazing what we can find out.

477
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:26.419
<v ->We have to get over our prejudices.</v>

478
00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:27.443
It was very interesting,

479
00:17:27.443 --> 00:17:30.109
taking a slight tangent to this

480
00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:32.808
and the issue of reincarnation for example.

481
00:17:32.808 --> 00:17:36.694
And Ian Stevenson's work at the University of Virginia.

482
00:17:36.694 --> 00:17:40.498
He found that people who had very strong

483
00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:42.450
past life memories, often

484
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.634
not always but often,

485
00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:45.073
had grown up in cultures

486
00:17:45.073 --> 00:17:46.887
that nurtured and allowed that to be possible.

487
00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:47.612
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

488
00:17:47.612 --> 00:17:52.020
<v ->So for a child to express past life memories in India,</v>

489
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.415
is a perfectly normal thing to do.

490
00:17:53.415 --> 00:17:54.716
And the child's not going to be slapped down

491
00:17:54.716 --> 00:17:56.017
or told that he or she is ridiculous

492
00:17:56.017 --> 00:17:57.809
for having those memories.

493
00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:00.006
And so naturally there's a greater capacity

494
00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:01.500
to work with those memories--

495
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.012
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

496
00:18:02.012 --> 00:18:02.588
<v ->In that culture.</v>

497
00:18:02.588 --> 00:18:03.750
Whereas in our culture,

498
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.073
the child who has those memories

499
00:18:05.073 --> 00:18:08.499
is likely to be dismissed as perhaps slightly deranged--

500
00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:08.977
<v Regina>Right.</v>

501
00:18:08.977 --> 00:18:11.736
<v ->By their parents and not encourage it.</v>

502
00:18:11.736 --> 00:18:13.222
<v Regina>Telling stories.</v>
<v Graham>Yeah.</v>

503
00:18:13.222 --> 00:18:14.073
<v Regina>Silly, yeah.</v>
<v Graham>Yeah, exactly.</v>

504
00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:14.451
<v ->Exactly.</v>

505
00:18:14.451 --> 00:18:17.512
So again it's a matter of creating.

506
00:18:17.512 --> 00:18:19.357
I think this is the challenge for the West

507
00:18:19.357 --> 00:18:20.189
in the future,

508
00:18:20.189 --> 00:18:22.536
is to create a new cultural context

509
00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:24.946
which is appropriate to our life and times.

510
00:18:24.946 --> 00:18:26.717
But which allows us to venture

511
00:18:26.717 --> 00:18:28.754
into the strange and the unknown,

512
00:18:28.754 --> 00:18:29.703
and the mysterious,

513
00:18:29.703 --> 00:18:31.431
because that's really where everything

514
00:18:31.431 --> 00:18:33.703
of great interest actually lies.

515
00:18:33.703 --> 00:18:36.348
It doesn't lie in the known and the charted,

516
00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:37.809
and the measured, and the weighed.

517
00:18:37.809 --> 00:18:39.836
We've got enough of that already.

518
00:18:39.836 --> 00:18:41.297
And maybe to much.

519
00:18:41.297 --> 00:18:43.726
And that's what's so harmful

520
00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:44.870
about our society

521
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.768
that has become very one dimensional.

522
00:18:46.768 --> 00:18:49.425
And that it has, undoubtedly,

523
00:18:49.425 --> 00:18:52.070
severed its connections with spirits.

524
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.075
Therefore no wonder

525
00:18:54.075 --> 00:18:55.526
the harm and the damage

526
00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:57.816
that Western society is doing

527
00:18:57.816 --> 00:18:59.880
in the world at large,

528
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.886
both in terms of warfare

529
00:19:01.886 --> 00:19:05.459
and in terms of environmental catastrophe.

530
00:19:05.459 --> 00:19:07.869
Were we reconnected to spirit,

531
00:19:07.869 --> 00:19:09.725
it's unlikely that we would behave that way.

532
00:19:09.725 --> 00:19:10.824
<v Regina>Yeah, and we have essentially</v>

533
00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:13.138
become slaves to this culture.

534
00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:13.586
<v ->Yeah.</v>

535
00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:14.237
<v Regina>All of us.</v>

536
00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:15.250
All of us have been

537
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.903
put in this very restricted box

538
00:19:16.903 --> 00:19:17.810
of exploration.

539
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.133
But we're breaking out of it

540
00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:21.383
and so I would like to get into Entangled

541
00:19:21.383 --> 00:19:24.615
and the genesis for your writing this story.

542
00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:26.492
Where are these experiences came from?

543
00:19:26.492 --> 00:19:29.671
And when I saw the title of the book initially

544
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:31.526
Entangled, I was thinking of Dean Radin.

545
00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:32.348
<v ->Right.</v>

546
00:19:32.348 --> 00:19:33.809
<v Regina>Who I interviewed, I guess about a year ago--</v>

547
00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:34.641
<v ->Entangled Minds.</v>

548
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:36.038
<v Regina>And the entanglement theory.</v>

549
00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:37.307
And I thought certainly because you've had

550
00:19:37.307 --> 00:19:39.473
a great interest in quantum theories and such--

551
00:19:39.473 --> 00:19:39.889
<v ->Yes.</v>

552
00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:41.467
<v Regina>This must be in part the title.</v>

553
00:19:41.467 --> 00:19:42.843
<v ->It is, it is.</v>

554
00:19:42.843 --> 00:19:44.678
Well this is my first novel.

555
00:19:44.678 --> 00:19:47.525
It's my first work of fiction.

556
00:19:47.525 --> 00:19:49.531
And I'm hoping that my non-fiction readers

557
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:51.547
will come with me.

558
00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:53.189
My non-fiction readers will know already

559
00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:55.258
that academic critics have been

560
00:19:55.258 --> 00:19:57.147
enormously hostile to my non-fiction--

561
00:19:57.147 --> 00:19:57.563
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

562
00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:58.469
<v ->For decades.</v>

563
00:19:58.469 --> 00:20:00.816
And many of them have described my non-fiction

564
00:20:00.816 --> 00:20:02.021
as fiction.

565
00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:03.802
So I thought I might as well go the whole hog.

566
00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:04.570
<v Regina>You might as well.</v>

567
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.711
(laughter)

568
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.655
<v ->And actually write a novel.</v>

569
00:20:08.655 --> 00:20:11.279
First and foremost I believe the responsibility

570
00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:13.903
of the novelist is to tell a compelling,

571
00:20:13.903 --> 00:20:15.951
fast-moving story.

572
00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:17.455
And the responsibility of the novelist

573
00:20:17.455 --> 00:20:19.481
is not to bore their readers,

574
00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:22.500
and that's what I've set out to do.

575
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.049
But secondly it's become clear to me

576
00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:28.046
that as a medium for exploring

577
00:20:28.046 --> 00:20:30.414
truly extraordinary ideas,

578
00:20:30.414 --> 00:20:32.131
fiction has much more to offer

579
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:35.640
than non-fiction does.

580
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.915
And the genesis of this book

581
00:20:38.915 --> 00:20:40.984
was curious.

582
00:20:40.984 --> 00:20:44.045
I had reached a stage in my life,

583
00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:47.458
actually after the publication of Underworld,

584
00:20:47.458 --> 00:20:52.194
where I was growing weary of constant battles

585
00:20:52.194 --> 00:20:55.116
and fights with academic critics.

586
00:20:55.116 --> 00:20:56.418
Not that I object to criticism,

587
00:20:56.418 --> 00:20:57.911
but so much of it was personalized.

588
00:20:57.911 --> 00:20:58.529
<v Regina>Right.</v>

589
00:20:58.529 --> 00:21:00.487
<v ->And it required me to spend so much time</v>

590
00:21:00.487 --> 00:21:02.289
bullet-proofing my arguments

591
00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:03.761
as I wrote them that my books

592
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:05.457
just got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger

593
00:21:05.457 --> 00:21:06.214
<v Graham>and bigger.</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

594
00:21:06.214 --> 00:21:07.057
<v Regina>Understandably yes.</v>

595
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:09.489
<v ->So that Underworld is like 800 and some pages long</v>

596
00:21:09.489 --> 00:21:11.814
with 1500 footnotes, you know.

597
00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:14.161
And that's a tough challenge to anybody,

598
00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:16.038
to expect anybody to sit down

599
00:21:16.038 --> 00:21:18.310
and read a book that weighs like four pounds.

600
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.355
<v Regina>Right, exactly.</v>

601
00:21:19.355 --> 00:21:23.984
<v ->And so I felt an urge to get back to the</v>

602
00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:26.277
place in my life that I was at

603
00:21:26.277 --> 00:21:27.835
when I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods,

604
00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:29.435
which is one of total freedom

605
00:21:29.435 --> 00:21:33.776
and disregard for what academia had to say.

606
00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:36.912
And I was trying to figure out a way to do that.

607
00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:38.448
And while I was trying to figure out that way,

608
00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:40.762
I did research and write my last non-fiction book,

609
00:21:40.762 --> 00:21:41.946
which was Supernatural.

610
00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:46.127
Which just exposed me to a whole other area

611
00:21:46.127 --> 00:21:47.941
of inquiry.

612
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:49.867
Particularly because the personal experiences

613
00:21:49.867 --> 00:21:52.576
that I sought out in order to write that book,

614
00:21:52.576 --> 00:21:54.859
involved altered states of consciousness,

615
00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:57.386
and particularly through ayahuasca.

616
00:21:57.386 --> 00:22:01.056
Which is used by more than 70 different cultures

617
00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:02.751
in the Amazon.

618
00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:03.637
And it's use, of course,

619
00:22:03.637 --> 00:22:05.887
is completely legal in all the countries

620
00:22:05.887 --> 00:22:07.274
surrounding the Amazon basin.

621
00:22:07.274 --> 00:22:08.255
In fact, it's not just legal

622
00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:10.388
but it's actually protected under laws

623
00:22:10.388 --> 00:22:11.455
of religious freedom.

624
00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.663
And the belief is that it opens a portal

625
00:22:13.663 --> 00:22:15.615
that allows us to make contact

626
00:22:15.615 --> 00:22:18.537
with the spirit world.

627
00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.958
And so, I initially drank ayahuasca

628
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:23.923
as a research exercise.

629
00:22:23.923 --> 00:22:28.226
But I found that its impact on me

630
00:22:28.226 --> 00:22:30.175
was so extraordinary and so important

631
00:22:30.175 --> 00:22:32.852
that I wanted to continue working with it.

632
00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:36.233
And I continued to do this.

633
00:22:36.233 --> 00:22:37.961
My view is that I ideally would like

634
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:41.705
to drink ayahuasca around five times a year.

635
00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:44.270
Because of the personal insights that it gives me.

636
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.002
Because it's shown me aspects of my own behavior

637
00:22:47.002 --> 00:22:48.164
that I need to fix.

638
00:22:48.164 --> 00:22:50.020
That's one of the curious things about ayahuasca.

639
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.135
She, and we do speak of the spirit of ayahuasca,

640
00:22:53.135 --> 00:22:55.108
as a female entity.

641
00:22:55.108 --> 00:22:58.617
Will show you truthfully your own nature.

642
00:22:58.617 --> 00:23:01.326
Of which some aspects may not be very pleasant.

643
00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:06.326
And that revelation can be quite painful actually.

644
00:23:06.691 --> 00:23:08.643
But it's tough love.

645
00:23:08.643 --> 00:23:10.691
It's a good thing to know,

646
00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:12.013
because it then gives you a chance

647
00:23:12.013 --> 00:23:14.221
to change aspects of your own behavior.

648
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:16.216
And I valued those lessons

649
00:23:16.216 --> 00:23:18.114
in the school of ayahuasca.

650
00:23:18.114 --> 00:23:19.277
But more than that

651
00:23:19.277 --> 00:23:20.674
I've enormously valued

652
00:23:20.674 --> 00:23:23.021
the sense of being plunged

653
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:25.805
and immersed into a seamlessly

654
00:23:25.805 --> 00:23:27.735
convincing parallel realm,

655
00:23:27.735 --> 00:23:30.423
which I know from my own research

656
00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:32.376
that many others who work with ayahuasca

657
00:23:32.376 --> 00:23:33.517
have also entered.

658
00:23:33.517 --> 00:23:34.945
Now normally when, you know,

659
00:23:34.945 --> 00:23:36.386
different human beings agree

660
00:23:36.386 --> 00:23:38.657
that they're all seeing the same thing--

661
00:23:38.657 --> 00:23:39.127
<v Regina>Right.</v>

662
00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.196
<v ->We accord to it the status of reality.</v>

663
00:23:41.196 --> 00:23:42.860
And I began to realize that that

664
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.164
might be exactly what was happening with ayahuasca.

665
00:23:45.164 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Regina>And you do talk about the common themes</v>

666
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.502
that were emerging.

667
00:23:48.502 --> 00:23:49.227
<v ->So many of those.</v>

668
00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:49.825
<v Regina>Through your research.</v>

669
00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:50.731
So many globally--

670
00:23:50.731 --> 00:23:51.318
<v ->Yeah.</v>

671
00:23:51.318 --> 00:23:52.427
<v Regina>That are so deeply embedded</v>

672
00:23:52.427 --> 00:23:54.795
within this multi-dimensional, sub-dimensional,

673
00:23:54.795 --> 00:23:55.563
subconscious--

674
00:23:55.563 --> 00:23:56.512
<v ->That's right.</v>

675
00:23:56.512 --> 00:23:59.446
<v Regina>Aspect of life that you merge in with.</v>

676
00:23:59.446 --> 00:23:59.957
<v ->That's right.</v>

677
00:23:59.957 --> 00:24:01.205
And this goes completely against

678
00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:03.232
the Western understanding of what so-called

679
00:24:03.232 --> 00:24:04.736
hallucinations are.

680
00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:07.456
Which are just suppose to be your brain on drugs,

681
00:24:07.456 --> 00:24:11.125
you know, with no profound depth or meaning to them.

682
00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:13.674
And likely all stitched together, kind of scrambled egg

683
00:24:13.674 --> 00:24:15.487
of your personal memories and elements

684
00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:16.852
from your biography.

685
00:24:16.852 --> 00:24:18.804
You wouldn't expect very deep

686
00:24:18.804 --> 00:24:20.596
and intense transpersonal elements--

687
00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:21.033
<v Regina>Right.</v>

688
00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:21.940
<v ->To emerge.</v>

689
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.145
Where actually the same, for example,

690
00:24:23.145 --> 00:24:25.257
the same being, many who drink ayahuasca

691
00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:27.348
have met the spirit of ayahuasca.

692
00:24:27.348 --> 00:24:29.204
And understand that a personality

693
00:24:29.204 --> 00:24:30.900
lies behind the veil.

694
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.737
And that this is an entity,

695
00:24:33.737 --> 00:24:37.704
which is involved with our planet,

696
00:24:37.704 --> 00:24:38.888
which is involved with the care

697
00:24:38.888 --> 00:24:42.163
and maintenance of our planet.

698
00:24:42.163 --> 00:24:45.160
And because a supernatural, non-physical entity

699
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.922
cannot intervene directly in the physical realm,

700
00:24:47.922 --> 00:24:50.056
but works through human consciousness.

701
00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:50.621
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

702
00:24:50.621 --> 00:24:52.797
<v ->Through accessing human consciousness</v>

703
00:24:52.797 --> 00:24:57.511
and suggesting new ways forward.

704
00:24:57.511 --> 00:24:59.623
And often very, very positive ones.

705
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:00.999
This is why many, many people

706
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.868
who drink ayahuasca come away from the experience

707
00:25:03.868 --> 00:25:06.630
with an enormously enhanced love and care

708
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.060
for the environment.

709
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.238
And a much greater sense of responsibility

710
00:25:11.238 --> 00:25:12.774
towards one another

711
00:25:12.774 --> 00:25:15.088
that they may have had before.

712
00:25:15.088 --> 00:25:16.784
And something else beyond all that

713
00:25:16.784 --> 00:25:19.291
is the creative inspiration--

714
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:19.899
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

715
00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:21.243
<v ->That ayahuasca gives.</v>

716
00:25:21.243 --> 00:25:23.216
And this seems to apply

717
00:25:23.216 --> 00:25:26.053
to whatever you as a person do best.

718
00:25:26.053 --> 00:25:28.048
So if you're an artist,

719
00:25:28.048 --> 00:25:30.970
ayahuasca will quite likely revolutionize

720
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.666
the nature of the art that you produce.

721
00:25:32.666 --> 00:25:33.786
And we can see this in the work

722
00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:36.826
of Martina Hoffman, or Robert Vanusa,

723
00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:38.756
or Alex Gray in the United States.

724
00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:43.375
All of whom have registered their appreciation

725
00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:45.785
for the role that ayahuasca has played in their art.

726
00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:48.505
And you can see it in the majestic and extraordinary works

727
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.593
of art that they produce.

728
00:25:49.593 --> 00:25:50.617
<v Regina>So for you you're a writer though.</v>

729
00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:52.686
<v ->(laughs) And I was going to say, you know,</v>

730
00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:56.771
I'm not a painter but I'm a writer.

731
00:25:56.771 --> 00:26:00.835
And it became clear to me that I was,

732
00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:03.064
through ayahuasca,

733
00:26:03.064 --> 00:26:05.784
I was beginning to lean more and more

734
00:26:05.784 --> 00:26:07.053
in the direction of wanting to take

735
00:26:07.053 --> 00:26:10.328
my creativity towards fiction.

736
00:26:10.328 --> 00:26:12.184
But I wasn't quite sure what to do of that.

737
00:26:12.184 --> 00:26:15.117
And again, it seems that ayahuasca

738
00:26:15.117 --> 00:26:16.834
works with what you have.

739
00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:18.082
And what I had,

740
00:26:18.082 --> 00:26:19.991
certainly was narrative gifts.

741
00:26:19.991 --> 00:26:23.212
I can write a compelling non-fiction story.

742
00:26:23.212 --> 00:26:23.820
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

743
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.908
Very true.

744
00:26:24.908 --> 00:26:26.657
<v ->And that's what I've been doing</v>

745
00:26:26.657 --> 00:26:28.204
for many, many years.

746
00:26:28.204 --> 00:26:29.857
And what I also had

747
00:26:29.857 --> 00:26:31.596
through the work on Supernatural,

748
00:26:31.596 --> 00:26:32.854
was a deep background

749
00:26:32.854 --> 00:26:35.798
in shamanism and in altered states of consciousness,

750
00:26:35.798 --> 00:26:37.985
and in the issues of the Stone Age

751
00:26:37.985 --> 00:26:40.054
and the mystery of the cave paintings,

752
00:26:40.054 --> 00:26:42.486
which feature strongly in that research.

753
00:26:42.486 --> 00:26:47.486
So come 2006, I went down to Brazil

754
00:26:48.576 --> 00:26:51.029
for five ayahuasca sessions.

755
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:53.024
With the specific intention

756
00:26:53.024 --> 00:26:55.285
that I would seek to explore

757
00:26:55.285 --> 00:26:57.343
whether I could write a work of fiction,

758
00:26:57.343 --> 00:27:00.501
and what that work of fiction might be.

759
00:27:00.501 --> 00:27:03.519
And I set that intent at the beginning

760
00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:05.524
of each of the sessions.

761
00:27:05.524 --> 00:27:07.817
And over five sessions of ayahuasca

762
00:27:07.817 --> 00:27:09.535
during a period of two weeks,

763
00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:12.606
in a most mysterious process,

764
00:27:12.606 --> 00:27:14.249
I was given the whole story

765
00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:17.267
that later became Entangled.

766
00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:19.710
I was told and shown

767
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.310
how it would work,

768
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.816
that there would be two characters,

769
00:27:23.816 --> 00:27:25.352
principal characters.

770
00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:27.347
Both of them young women.

771
00:27:27.347 --> 00:27:29.811
Ria, in the Stone Age,

772
00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:31.827
she's an anatomically modern human being

773
00:27:31.827 --> 00:27:35.336
like you and I belonging to the Cro-Magnon group,

774
00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:40.336
and she lives 24,000 years ago in northern Spain.

775
00:27:40.978 --> 00:27:42.674
And the other principal character

776
00:27:42.674 --> 00:27:44.924
would be a young modern woman,

777
00:27:44.924 --> 00:27:46.642
her name is Leoni.

778
00:27:46.642 --> 00:27:50.055
And she lives in Los Angeles.

779
00:27:50.055 --> 00:27:51.516
And both of these young women,

780
00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:52.935
in the quantum physics sense,

781
00:27:52.935 --> 00:27:54.854
would be entangled.

782
00:27:54.854 --> 00:27:56.070
That what affected one,

783
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.766
would affect the other.

784
00:27:57.766 --> 00:27:59.643
Because what was also shown to me

785
00:27:59.643 --> 00:28:00.433
in these visions,

786
00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:02.662
is that time is not at all what it seems.

787
00:28:02.662 --> 00:28:04.753
Time is not an arrow,

788
00:28:04.753 --> 00:28:06.982
where cause and effect can only work

789
00:28:06.982 --> 00:28:08.055
in one direction.

790
00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:10.188
It's not simply that you must go

791
00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.972
from past through present to future.

792
00:28:12.972 --> 00:28:15.340
That time is more like cycles and spirals

793
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.918
that spin around and wrap, and cross,

794
00:28:16.918 --> 00:28:17.825
and transect.

795
00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:18.710
<v Regina>Even Stephen Hawking--</v>

796
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.617
<v ->Yes.</v>

797
00:28:19.617 --> 00:28:22.049
<v Regina>Has an affinity for time, space, yes.</v>

798
00:28:22.049 --> 00:28:23.094
<v ->Exactly.</v>

799
00:28:23.094 --> 00:28:25.739
And I was shown this in a very direct,

800
00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:28.203
experiential way, so that it would be possible

801
00:28:28.203 --> 00:28:31.296
for both of these characters to interact.

802
00:28:31.296 --> 00:28:32.149
And the question would be

803
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:33.749
how would they interact?

804
00:28:33.749 --> 00:28:36.746
And I didn't poset a time machine.

805
00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:40.117
I used altered states of consciousness

806
00:28:40.117 --> 00:28:42.602
as the mechanism by which these two character

807
00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:44.245
got in contact.

808
00:28:44.245 --> 00:28:46.101
And who is bringing them together

809
00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:48.106
is a supernatural being,

810
00:28:48.106 --> 00:28:50.378
very much based on the spirit of ayahuasca.

811
00:28:50.378 --> 00:28:52.052
I call her the Blue Angel.

812
00:28:52.052 --> 00:28:56.233
Who is in conflict with a demonic force

813
00:28:56.233 --> 00:29:00.041
that seeks to mislead humanity

814
00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:03.401
and to destroy all human potential.

815
00:29:03.401 --> 00:29:05.961
A force that is operating in the Stone Age

816
00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:08.158
and in the 21st century,

817
00:29:08.158 --> 00:29:09.768
and it seeks to manifest fully

818
00:29:09.768 --> 00:29:10.995
in the 21st century.

819
00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:12.904
And that this force must be defeated,

820
00:29:12.904 --> 00:29:15.688
but it's human beings who must defeat it.

821
00:29:15.688 --> 00:29:17.469
And so these two young women

822
00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:22.418
are chosen to do battle with this demon, called Supa

823
00:29:22.418 --> 00:29:23.837
who travels through time.

824
00:29:23.837 --> 00:29:25.714
That's the essence of the plot.

825
00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:27.997
And what's at stake in the plot

826
00:29:27.997 --> 00:29:30.759
is the fate of the Neanderthals.

827
00:29:30.759 --> 00:29:33.052
As I mentioned Ria is an anatomically

828
00:29:33.052 --> 00:29:34.706
modern human like you and I,

829
00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:36.209
but living in northern Spain

830
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:37.863
at that time and this is fact,

831
00:29:37.863 --> 00:29:39.836
around 24,000 years ago

832
00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:42.065
were the last of the Neanderthals,

833
00:29:42.065 --> 00:29:44.412
our archaic cousins.

834
00:29:44.412 --> 00:29:46.331
Who look a bit different from us.

835
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:48.379
They've got much heavier brow ridges,

836
00:29:48.379 --> 00:29:50.353
really almost no necks.

837
00:29:50.353 --> 00:29:53.019
They're massively strong, physically.

838
00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:57.317
And I suppose that anatomically modern human beings

839
00:29:57.317 --> 00:29:59.077
wouldn't necessarily have liked the way look,

840
00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:01.979
and so in the novel the modern humans call them

841
00:30:01.979 --> 00:30:03.120
the uglies.

842
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.325
But as we get to know them,

843
00:30:04.325 --> 00:30:08.101
we discover that they are beings filled with light and love,

844
00:30:08.101 --> 00:30:10.649
and compassion, and truth, and depth.

845
00:30:10.649 --> 00:30:11.887
And that they communicate not verbally

846
00:30:11.887 --> 00:30:14.734
but by telepathy.

847
00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:16.761
And they're the source of all the goodness

848
00:30:16.761 --> 00:30:17.988
in the world.

849
00:30:17.988 --> 00:30:19.726
And it's them that the demon

850
00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:21.102
seeks to destroy.

851
00:30:21.102 --> 00:30:22.819
Because if he can make human beings

852
00:30:22.819 --> 00:30:24.632
destroy the Neanderthals,

853
00:30:24.632 --> 00:30:26.627
then he will gain a psychic charge

854
00:30:26.627 --> 00:30:28.440
sufficient enough to allow him

855
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.299
to manifest fully in the 21st century.

856
00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:34.008
And we the doom of all mankind.

857
00:30:34.008 --> 00:30:36.397
So the issue of the fate of the Neanderthals

858
00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:38.424
becomes key.

859
00:30:38.424 --> 00:30:39.650
And the truth is we don't know

860
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.623
what happened to the Neanderthals.

861
00:30:41.623 --> 00:30:43.181
We don't know why they became extinct.

862
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:44.994
We know that they became extinct,

863
00:30:44.994 --> 00:30:46.135
and there's a lot of assumptions

864
00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.660
that it may have been

865
00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.962
a kind of ethnic genocide

866
00:30:48.962 --> 00:30:52.396
by our species against theirs.

867
00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:53.953
And the jeopardy in the novel

868
00:30:53.953 --> 00:30:56.620
is that that must not happen.

869
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.622
However the Neanderthals

870
00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:59.340
become extinct it must not be

871
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.198
through human beings killing them off.

872
00:31:02.198 --> 00:31:04.801
And that's what my two young female heroines

873
00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:07.147
are fighting to prevent.

874
00:31:07.147 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Regina>One question.</v>

875
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.302
Why two women?

876
00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:12.043
<v ->I felt very strongly from the beginning,</v>

877
00:31:12.043 --> 00:31:14.571
from the source, from those ayahuasca visions,

878
00:31:14.571 --> 00:31:18.357
that the spirit of the feminine had to come forward

879
00:31:18.357 --> 00:31:21.888
very strongly in this story.

880
00:31:21.888 --> 00:31:25.717
Really we've had enough of testosterone fueled,

881
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.383
masculine energy, which has brought

882
00:31:28.383 --> 00:31:32.106
so much horror to the world.

883
00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:35.679
And there's a wisdom and a gentleness

884
00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:37.887
in the female energy,

885
00:31:37.887 --> 00:31:39.561
which I wanted to express.

886
00:31:39.561 --> 00:31:41.438
But also a toughness.

887
00:31:41.438 --> 00:31:44.521
These young women are not (laughs)

888
00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:45.641
are not wimps, you know.

889
00:31:45.641 --> 00:31:46.249
<v Regina>Right.</v>

890
00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:47.315
<v ->They're fighters.</v>

891
00:31:47.315 --> 00:31:50.238
And this is a story of adventure

892
00:31:50.238 --> 00:31:51.379
and of battle.

893
00:31:51.379 --> 00:31:52.648
And it's very interesting if you go back

894
00:31:52.648 --> 00:31:54.515
to the Stone Age, you'll find that the

895
00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:55.784
human images that are preserved

896
00:31:55.784 --> 00:31:57.139
are of women.

897
00:31:57.139 --> 00:32:00.360
And indeed it's evident that there was a,

898
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.333
what's been called a cult of the goddess,

899
00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:03.794
at that time.

900
00:32:03.794 --> 00:32:05.031
And it was really only when we moved

901
00:32:05.031 --> 00:32:08.050
into agriculture and permanent settlements

902
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.140
that the masculinization of gods

903
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.178
began to take place.

904
00:32:12.178 --> 00:32:12.647
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

905
00:32:12.647 --> 00:32:13.692
<v ->And maybe that was a misstep,</v>

906
00:32:13.692 --> 00:32:15.665
maybe that was a misdirection.

907
00:32:15.665 --> 00:32:18.706
<v Regina>And there has been some Neanderthal news</v>

908
00:32:18.706 --> 00:32:20.914
as of late, which is interesting.

909
00:32:20.914 --> 00:32:22.194
I think I must have read that on your site

910
00:32:22.194 --> 00:32:23.100
a few days ago.

911
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.348
But let's talk about some of it.

912
00:32:24.348 --> 00:32:25.116
I mean some of the things

913
00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:25.788
you wrote a year ago

914
00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:27.068
have been validated already.

915
00:32:27.068 --> 00:32:27.505
<v ->Yes.</v>

916
00:32:27.505 --> 00:32:28.572
<v Regina>Which is amazing</v>

917
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:30.641
that you were shown this for a reason,

918
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:32.124
not to be made a fool of obviously.

919
00:32:32.124 --> 00:32:32.828
<v ->Yeah.</v>

920
00:32:32.828 --> 00:32:35.040
That's what I felt.

921
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.863
It was very bizarre, the writing process.

922
00:32:39.863 --> 00:32:41.271
First of all to tell you a little bit

923
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:43.041
about the writing process.

924
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.473
So different from writing non-fiction.

925
00:32:45.473 --> 00:32:47.681
No longer is my office strewn with

926
00:32:47.681 --> 00:32:48.470
hundreds of books.

927
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.886
<v Regina>I bet.</v>

928
00:32:48.886 --> 00:32:50.145
<v ->Open at all kinds of different pages</v>

929
00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:51.905
with yellow tags all over them.

930
00:32:51.905 --> 00:32:54.347
I don't have to deal with that at all,

931
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.758
because primarily what I'm doing here

932
00:32:56.758 --> 00:32:58.731
is channeling information

933
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:01.846
from a deeply imagined source.

934
00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:03.563
I don't need the reference books.

935
00:33:03.563 --> 00:33:04.651
<v Regina>How freeing.</v>

936
00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:06.400
<v ->And it was a very liberating,</v>

937
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.650
and I don't need to concern myself at all

938
00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:10.016
with bullet-proofing any argument.

939
00:33:10.016 --> 00:33:11.616
All I have to do is tell a great story

940
00:33:11.616 --> 00:33:14.666
that people will want to read.

941
00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:16.053
And so writing it actually was

942
00:33:16.053 --> 00:33:18.495
more a process of defocusing,

943
00:33:18.495 --> 00:33:20.746
than of focusing.

944
00:33:20.746 --> 00:33:22.143
It was quite a different writing task.

945
00:33:22.143 --> 00:33:24.319
And sometimes it would take me

946
00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:27.433
a very long time to work through a paragraphs.

947
00:33:27.433 --> 00:33:29.662
And this would be when I was intellectually

948
00:33:29.662 --> 00:33:32.052
fighting against the flow of the ideas.

949
00:33:32.052 --> 00:33:35.326
If I just let go and let the ideas carry me,

950
00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:37.257
I would keep on going in the right direction.

951
00:33:37.257 --> 00:33:38.974
But sometimes my intellect would force me

952
00:33:38.974 --> 00:33:40.456
to take the story in another direction.

953
00:33:40.456 --> 00:33:42.056
And I'd have a heavy leaden sense--

954
00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:42.622
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

955
00:33:42.622 --> 00:33:43.848
<v ->That I was moving the wrong way.</v>

956
00:33:43.848 --> 00:33:45.608
And I'd go three, four, five days down it,

957
00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:47.357
or the writing would get slower and slower and slower

958
00:33:47.357 --> 00:33:48.605
till I actually couldn't do it anymore.

959
00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:49.416
<v Regina>You lose all your energy.</v>

960
00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:51.282
<v ->And then I had to back up to the point</v>

961
00:33:51.282 --> 00:33:52.925
where I'd taken that wrong fork

962
00:33:52.925 --> 00:33:55.687
and reconnect with what I had already

963
00:33:55.687 --> 00:33:57.106
downloaded into myself.

964
00:33:57.106 --> 00:33:58.781
Because what I was shown under ayahuasca

965
00:33:58.781 --> 00:34:00.263
some of it was at the conscious level,

966
00:34:00.263 --> 00:34:02.215
but I came to realize that a lot of it

967
00:34:02.215 --> 00:34:04.508
was at the unconscious level.

968
00:34:04.508 --> 00:34:06.225
And that it was a matter of drawing

969
00:34:06.225 --> 00:34:08.711
that out of myself and expressing it.

970
00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:10.940
Well while I was doing this,

971
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.798
it became clear to me

972
00:34:13.798 --> 00:34:16.540
that the Neanderthals had for example red hair.

973
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.982
And I gave them red hair.

974
00:34:18.982 --> 00:34:22.160
There was no scientific data at that time

975
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.579
which suggested that the Neanderthals

976
00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:24.987
had red hair.

977
00:34:24.987 --> 00:34:27.749
But more than a year after I had established

978
00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:29.541
that characteristic of the Neanderthals

979
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:31.355
in my novels, scientific research came out

980
00:34:31.355 --> 00:34:32.720
which showed that the Neanderthals

981
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.088
had indeed had red hair.

982
00:34:35.088 --> 00:34:39.429
And indeed that the gene for red hair

983
00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.149
in modern Western populations,

984
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:45.498
is almost certainly owed to the Neanderthals.

985
00:34:45.498 --> 00:34:46.650
Because that's the other thing

986
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.647
that I was arguing in this novel,

987
00:34:49.647 --> 00:34:50.788
that there was the possibility

988
00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.825
for romance and love between

989
00:34:52.825 --> 00:34:54.948
Neanderthals and humans.

990
00:34:54.948 --> 00:34:56.526
Well this is again, always been dismissed

991
00:34:56.526 --> 00:34:58.820
as utterly impossible by scientists.

992
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.494
But now that the Neanderthal genome

993
00:35:00.494 --> 00:35:01.721
has been sequenced,

994
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:04.206
we know that Neanderthals and humans

995
00:35:04.206 --> 00:35:05.208
did make love.

996
00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:06.968
Because 4% of modern human genes

997
00:35:06.968 --> 00:35:09.987
are owed to our Neanderthal cousins.

998
00:35:09.987 --> 00:35:11.864
And something else.

999
00:35:11.864 --> 00:35:13.848
The Neanderthal's in my story

1000
00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:18.848
are gentle and loving, and compassionate creatures.

1001
00:35:20.717 --> 00:35:23.223
They detest violence.

1002
00:35:23.223 --> 00:35:25.847
They can't see the point of it.

1003
00:35:25.847 --> 00:35:29.676
They're filled with love and with the light of love.

1004
00:35:29.676 --> 00:35:32.023
Which is precisely why the demon wants to

1005
00:35:32.023 --> 00:35:33.676
destroy them.

1006
00:35:33.676 --> 00:35:35.927
And again, there was no scientific evidence

1007
00:35:35.927 --> 00:35:37.686
for that when I was writing it.

1008
00:35:37.686 --> 00:35:39.638
But again, just as we're talking now

1009
00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.772
at the beginning of October 2010,

1010
00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:43.233
just round about now,

1011
00:35:43.233 --> 00:35:45.494
there is a huge amount of information

1012
00:35:45.494 --> 00:35:47.350
come out from new scientific studies,

1013
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.875
which have absolutely proofed

1014
00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.667
that the Neanderthals were indeed

1015
00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:52.032
filled with compassion.

1016
00:35:52.032 --> 00:35:54.827
Evidence for example of care for the elderly

1017
00:35:54.827 --> 00:35:56.427
long past the point where they could have cared

1018
00:35:56.427 --> 00:35:57.771
for themselves.

1019
00:35:57.771 --> 00:35:59.168
Care for the blind.

1020
00:35:59.168 --> 00:36:01.141
Care for individuals in their societies

1021
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:03.232
who had broken or lost limbs.

1022
00:36:03.232 --> 00:36:04.735
They weren't simply cast aside.

1023
00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:07.295
They were nurtured and looked after,

1024
00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:12.170
and protected with a true deep human compassion.

1025
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.164
So in a weird kind of way,

1026
00:36:15.164 --> 00:36:18.346
again and again as I was wriing this story

1027
00:36:18.346 --> 00:36:20.735
the information that I was putting down on the page

1028
00:36:20.735 --> 00:36:23.572
would turn out to be validated days, or weeks,

1029
00:36:23.572 --> 00:36:27.583
or months, or years later by scientific research.

1030
00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:29.833
And I did find that and do still find it

1031
00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:33.225
a most mysterious process.

1032
00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:36.499
You know another, just another aspect of this

1033
00:36:36.499 --> 00:36:38.195
which was also very strange.

1034
00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.496
Which again has been born out

1035
00:36:39.496 --> 00:36:42.078
in this case by quantum physics research,

1036
00:36:42.078 --> 00:36:44.275
is the notion planted in the book,

1037
00:36:44.275 --> 00:36:46.504
that actually the past can be changed

1038
00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.923
by what we do now.

1039
00:36:47.923 --> 00:36:49.160
That the flow of cause and effect

1040
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.016
isn't just from the past to the future,

1041
00:36:51.016 --> 00:36:54.098
but it can be from the future back to the past as well.

1042
00:36:54.098 --> 00:36:57.607
And there's been a number of recent quantum physic papers

1043
00:36:57.607 --> 00:37:00.946
which have argued exactly the same point.

1044
00:37:00.946 --> 00:37:03.431
<v Regina>The timing on this, as the book is released,</v>

1045
00:37:03.431 --> 00:37:04.903
that these various studies are coming out,

1046
00:37:04.903 --> 00:37:07.196
is I think particularly thrilling.

1047
00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:08.199
<v ->Yeah, me too.</v>

1048
00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:11.494
I mean I get goosebumps when this goes on.

1049
00:37:11.494 --> 00:37:12.348
<v Regina>It is amazing.</v>

1050
00:37:12.348 --> 00:37:15.422
<v ->And what it says to me is that</v>

1051
00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:18.716
this strange source of inspiration

1052
00:37:18.716 --> 00:37:22.012
that I received through ayahuasca

1053
00:37:22.012 --> 00:37:23.643
set me on the right track.

1054
00:37:23.643 --> 00:37:28.643
And put me down a road of inquiry

1055
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.024
and the expression of ideas,

1056
00:37:31.024 --> 00:37:33.179
which is true.

1057
00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:35.899
Not simply fiction.

1058
00:37:35.899 --> 00:37:38.053
<v Regina>No, obviously not fiction.</v>

1059
00:37:38.053 --> 00:37:38.917
And it makes you wonder what

1060
00:37:38.917 --> 00:37:40.570
Mary Auel was smoking back when

1061
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.309
she wrote Clan of the Cave Bears.

1062
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:45.167
Because some of these same themes

1063
00:37:45.167 --> 00:37:46.117
were coming up through her.

1064
00:37:46.117 --> 00:37:47.141
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

1065
00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:48.346
<v Regina>Which was much more simplified.</v>

1066
00:37:48.346 --> 00:37:49.412
<v ->William Golding too, by the way.</v>

1067
00:37:49.412 --> 00:37:49.828
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1068
00:37:49.828 --> 00:37:50.682
<v ->And his book The Inheritors.</v>

1069
00:37:50.682 --> 00:37:51.152
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1070
00:37:51.152 --> 00:37:53.839
<v ->It seems that fiction has been able</v>

1071
00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:55.983
to get to grips with the notion

1072
00:37:55.983 --> 00:37:58.351
of the Neanderthals as a force for good.

1073
00:37:58.351 --> 00:37:58.970
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1074
00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.324
<v ->Long before science has,</v>

1075
00:38:00.324 --> 00:38:02.714
but science is finally catching up.

1076
00:38:02.714 --> 00:38:03.567
<v Regina>That's fabulous.</v>

1077
00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:05.316
Well what about this whole notion

1078
00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:06.873
of good and evil?

1079
00:38:06.873 --> 00:38:08.377
And Supta, it's Sup...

1080
00:38:08.377 --> 00:38:10.628
<v ->Supa is the demonic force.</v>

1081
00:38:10.628 --> 00:38:12.185
<v Regina>And what about the genesis</v>

1082
00:38:12.185 --> 00:38:14.275
of this character through your own experience

1083
00:38:14.275 --> 00:38:16.153
when you were going through your journey.

1084
00:38:16.153 --> 00:38:19.758
Were you confronted with this same influence?

1085
00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:23.587
<v ->It's very clear that what the shamans call</v>

1086
00:38:23.587 --> 00:38:26.787
the spirit world, and quantum physicists

1087
00:38:26.787 --> 00:38:29.229
may call parallel dimensions,

1088
00:38:29.229 --> 00:38:30.904
is not all good.

1089
00:38:30.904 --> 00:38:32.994
It's not all sweetness and light.

1090
00:38:32.994 --> 00:38:37.122
That there are powerful forces for good out there,

1091
00:38:37.122 --> 00:38:39.885
but there are also powerful forces for evil.

1092
00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:42.583
And it's not an accident that many ancient cultures

1093
00:38:42.583 --> 00:38:45.484
speak of angels and demons.

1094
00:38:45.484 --> 00:38:47.159
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1095
00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:49.933
<v ->As kind of shorthand for these</v>

1096
00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:53.677
positive and negative forces in the spirit realm.

1097
00:38:53.677 --> 00:38:58.677
And indeed I have encountered such entities.

1098
00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:02.540
When ayahuasca opens the door to the other realm

1099
00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.814
you have to be strong, you have to brace yourself.

1100
00:39:05.814 --> 00:39:09.718
And I think it's important to remember

1101
00:39:09.718 --> 00:39:13.366
that these non-physical realms of experience

1102
00:39:13.366 --> 00:39:17.291
cannot intervene directly in the physical world.

1103
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:20.470
But that they can intervene through human consciousness.

1104
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.765
And this where human choice becomes so important.

1105
00:39:23.765 --> 00:39:28.010
And that in a way is our greatest responsibility I believe,

1106
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:29.621
as human beings.

1107
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:33.471
To take responsibility and own our choices.

1108
00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:36.927
And those choices can be for good,

1109
00:39:36.927 --> 00:39:39.178
or they can be for evil.

1110
00:39:39.178 --> 00:39:41.226
And we do know in our own hearts

1111
00:39:41.226 --> 00:39:44.959
which direction the choice goes in.

1112
00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:46.452
And I think it's important to realize

1113
00:39:46.452 --> 00:39:48.009
that when we do that,

1114
00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:49.886
when we make a choice

1115
00:39:49.886 --> 00:39:51.422
that is perhaps going to result

1116
00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:54.089
in very negative consequences for others,

1117
00:39:54.089 --> 00:39:57.225
that is not simply something that is

1118
00:39:57.225 --> 00:39:59.944
happening in this physical realm.

1119
00:39:59.944 --> 00:40:01.427
It is spreading out its influence

1120
00:40:01.427 --> 00:40:04.307
into the spiritual realm as well.

1121
00:40:04.307 --> 00:40:06.045
And I think it's very important

1122
00:40:06.045 --> 00:40:08.883
for we humans to consider very carefully

1123
00:40:08.883 --> 00:40:10.034
each and every choice,

1124
00:40:10.034 --> 00:40:13.224
no matter how minute or how large it may be.

1125
00:40:13.224 --> 00:40:16.359
And ask ourselves, is this really the right thing to do?

1126
00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:20.135
Or is harm and damage going to come from this?

1127
00:40:20.135 --> 00:40:22.599
And particularly is there an intent

1128
00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:24.391
for harm and damage in it.

1129
00:40:24.391 --> 00:40:25.553
<v Regina>Couldn't agree more.</v>

1130
00:40:25.553 --> 00:40:27.313
<v ->You know we must say no to that.</v>

1131
00:40:27.313 --> 00:40:29.148
It's very, very important to say no.

1132
00:40:29.148 --> 00:40:30.215
There's all kinds of...

1133
00:40:30.215 --> 00:40:31.868
You know the ancient text and the scriptures

1134
00:40:31.868 --> 00:40:33.958
talk a lot about temptation.

1135
00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:37.466
And I would say that is the demonic side

1136
00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:40.528
urging us to go down a road

1137
00:40:40.528 --> 00:40:42.106
which may be very attractive

1138
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.709
and may seem to offer us all kinds of

1139
00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:46.330
immediate gains.

1140
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.284
But ultimately, will be very bad for us,

1141
00:40:49.284 --> 00:40:50.682
and very, very bad for others.

1142
00:40:50.682 --> 00:40:52.505
And whenever we make a choice like that,

1143
00:40:52.505 --> 00:40:54.969
the dark side wins and the light loses.

1144
00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:55.737
<v Regina>You can feel though that</v>

1145
00:40:55.737 --> 00:40:56.644
when you're making that decision.

1146
00:40:56.644 --> 00:40:57.081
<v ->Yes.</v>

1147
00:40:57.081 --> 00:40:58.041
<v Regina>If when we're to honest</v>

1148
00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:00.078
we know inside the difference.

1149
00:41:00.078 --> 00:41:02.937
And it might be very nuanced and very subtle.

1150
00:41:02.937 --> 00:41:04.537
But I agree with you.

1151
00:41:04.537 --> 00:41:05.283
<v ->There's an inner voice.</v>

1152
00:41:05.283 --> 00:41:07.353
<v Regina>Making the distinction,</v>

1153
00:41:07.353 --> 00:41:08.600
even in the most subtle,

1154
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.595
even when nobody knows the difference,

1155
00:41:10.595 --> 00:41:12.366
that's really where,

1156
00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:14.285
I think that that kind of decision

1157
00:41:14.285 --> 00:41:16.195
has to be made is at the most subtle levels.

1158
00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:16.653
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1159
00:41:16.653 --> 00:41:17.837
<v Regina>It's easy to make the big ones.</v>

1160
00:41:17.837 --> 00:41:18.488
But we cheat.

1161
00:41:18.488 --> 00:41:19.000
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1162
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.928
<v Regina>We let ourselves off easy--</v>

1163
00:41:19.928 --> 00:41:20.557
<v ->All the time.</v>

1164
00:41:20.557 --> 00:41:21.677
<v Regina>On the subtle ones.</v>

1165
00:41:21.677 --> 00:41:24.274
Another question here.

1166
00:41:24.274 --> 00:41:26.509
This may or may not be your experience but,

1167
00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:27.906
when you're in those other realms

1168
00:41:27.906 --> 00:41:30.423
and you're looking at these various expressions

1169
00:41:30.423 --> 00:41:33.473
of spirit forces in these subdimensional realms,

1170
00:41:33.473 --> 00:41:36.332
whatever you call them.

1171
00:41:36.332 --> 00:41:40.395
Is there, in your mind, a crossover

1172
00:41:40.395 --> 00:41:42.859
that can occur such as in the,

1173
00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:44.832
it's mentioned in many, many works,

1174
00:41:44.832 --> 00:41:47.189
but Anastasia, The Ringing Cedars,

1175
00:41:47.189 --> 00:41:48.629
many of the people that are out today

1176
00:41:48.629 --> 00:41:49.813
that we know of,

1177
00:41:49.813 --> 00:41:52.181
where they're saying that these types of entities

1178
00:41:52.181 --> 00:41:53.034
who live in this dimension

1179
00:41:53.034 --> 00:41:54.965
also have physical expression into

1180
00:41:54.965 --> 00:41:57.546
the physical realm, and through reincarnations

1181
00:41:57.546 --> 00:41:58.123
and bodies.

1182
00:41:58.123 --> 00:41:59.168
Have you seen this?

1183
00:41:59.168 --> 00:42:00.011
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

1184
00:42:00.011 --> 00:42:02.581
I would say that that's absolutely true.

1185
00:42:02.581 --> 00:42:04.789
There are some great teachers

1186
00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:07.861
who incarnate in physical form.

1187
00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:10.826
And there are some great misleaders also,

1188
00:42:10.826 --> 00:42:13.525
who incarnate in physical form.

1189
00:42:13.525 --> 00:42:14.965
<v Regina>Have you been shown anything</v>

1190
00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.660
worth mentioning?

1191
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.772
<v ->No, I've been shown this more</v>

1192
00:42:18.772 --> 00:42:23.711
in the sense of the true nature of reality.

1193
00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:27.476
That there are these two poles,

1194
00:42:27.476 --> 00:42:31.444
and that really we need to see mankind

1195
00:42:31.444 --> 00:42:35.497
as the fulcrum of cosmic struggle

1196
00:42:35.497 --> 00:42:40.350
which is taking place in spiritual realms.

1197
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:44.243
And that the unique feature of the human creature

1198
00:42:44.243 --> 00:42:49.243
is that we are part body and part spirit.

1199
00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:51.208
We live in both worlds,

1200
00:42:51.208 --> 00:42:55.485
and therefore what we do can affect both worlds.

1201
00:42:55.485 --> 00:42:58.333
But have I been shown a particular political leader,

1202
00:42:58.333 --> 00:43:00.850
who is leading us down a demonic path, no.

1203
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.610
<v Regina>Oh well, I said it was just a thought.</v>

1204
00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.626
(laughter)

1205
00:43:04.626 --> 00:43:07.996
You know I love the fact that you've come out with this

1206
00:43:07.996 --> 00:43:11.132
and I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to get my hands

1207
00:43:11.132 --> 00:43:12.156
on one earlier.

1208
00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:13.457
But I have one now.

1209
00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:15.750
And it's going to be my companion next weekend

1210
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.956
when I have a couple days off.

1211
00:43:16.956 --> 00:43:18.382
I'm just going to throw myself in it,

1212
00:43:18.382 --> 00:43:19.790
because the reviews are so incredible

1213
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.369
to this point.

1214
00:43:21.369 --> 00:43:22.863
But I have to say,

1215
00:43:22.863 --> 00:43:25.231
I really applaud you for choosing

1216
00:43:25.231 --> 00:43:27.001
to take these themes that are so dear to you

1217
00:43:27.001 --> 00:43:29.252
that are now being validated even through

1218
00:43:29.252 --> 00:43:30.457
the world of science,

1219
00:43:30.457 --> 00:43:32.868
and putting it into this very freeing,

1220
00:43:32.868 --> 00:43:35.011
as you say fast-paced, compelling story.

1221
00:43:35.011 --> 00:43:37.379
Because I've noticed throughout my lifetime,

1222
00:43:37.379 --> 00:43:38.883
and I've had to do a tremendous amount

1223
00:43:38.883 --> 00:43:42.414
of research in order to this job and others.

1224
00:43:42.414 --> 00:43:46.776
That I really tend to have the deepest memory,

1225
00:43:46.776 --> 00:43:48.589
almost on a cellular level,

1226
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:50.424
once it's put into a context

1227
00:43:50.424 --> 00:43:53.186
in which I can also engage my feelings--

1228
00:43:53.186 --> 00:43:53.518
<v ->Yes.</v>

1229
00:43:53.518 --> 00:43:54.584
<v Regina>and my emotions.</v>

1230
00:43:54.584 --> 00:43:56.461
Often times in the textbooks,

1231
00:43:56.461 --> 00:43:58.061
you're a bit of an exception,

1232
00:43:58.061 --> 00:44:00.920
because you do write compelling stories

1233
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.074
even when it's scientifically based.

1234
00:44:03.074 --> 00:44:05.559
A lot of it's not, you know, compelling.

1235
00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:08.770
<v ->Yeah this move to fiction for me,</v>

1236
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.372
it's precisely it's all about that.

1237
00:44:11.372 --> 00:44:15.852
It's about using my skills

1238
00:44:15.852 --> 00:44:20.289
to express ideas and allow people to

1239
00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:21.793
identify with them strongly

1240
00:44:21.793 --> 00:44:25.025
at the emotional and at the spiritual level

1241
00:44:25.025 --> 00:44:26.390
as well just at the intellectual level.

1242
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.275
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1243
00:44:27.275 --> 00:44:29.089
<v ->I think that's very important,</v>

1244
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:31.815
and I believe this is going to be my path

1245
00:44:31.815 --> 00:44:32.868
for the future.

1246
00:44:32.868 --> 00:44:33.732
<v Regina>I heard there were sequels.</v>

1247
00:44:33.732 --> 00:44:34.244
<v ->Yes.</v>

1248
00:44:34.244 --> 00:44:36.452
<v Regina>(laughs) People are already guessing that.</v>

1249
00:44:36.452 --> 00:44:38.030
<v ->A sequel is in process, yeah.</v>

1250
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.745
<v Regina>Okay, a sequel.</v>

1251
00:44:38.745 --> 00:44:40.739
So we have even more to look forward to.

1252
00:44:40.739 --> 00:44:42.435
How long might it take you to put that together,

1253
00:44:42.435 --> 00:44:42.968
might I ask.

1254
00:44:42.968 --> 00:44:43.736
<v ->Oh another a year so.</v>

1255
00:44:43.736 --> 00:44:44.408
<v Regina>Another year or so.</v>

1256
00:44:44.408 --> 00:44:45.987
So we'll just have to be patient.

1257
00:44:45.987 --> 00:44:48.771
So anything else in conclusion here

1258
00:44:48.771 --> 00:44:51.032
to this conversation about

1259
00:44:51.032 --> 00:44:52.141
having gone this route.

1260
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:55.256
And really where it's taken you personally now,

1261
00:44:55.256 --> 00:44:58.690
in terms, we agree that sovereignty of the mind

1262
00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.306
is the most important.

1263
00:45:01.306 --> 00:45:04.035
I think it should occupy center stage

1264
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:05.550
of our own personal agenda,

1265
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.491
is this sovereignty of mind and deep honesty.

1266
00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:09.720
<v ->Yeah, I have strong views on this.</v>

1267
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.301
I do think that one of the terrible things

1268
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:15.277
that is happening in our society,

1269
00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:16.717
is the way that the state

1270
00:45:16.717 --> 00:45:18.616
is growing and growing in power.

1271
00:45:18.616 --> 00:45:21.592
And taking power away from individuals

1272
00:45:21.592 --> 00:45:24.119
in areas where really the state has no business

1273
00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:26.765
sticking its nose.

1274
00:45:26.765 --> 00:45:30.668
Areas to do with healthcare for example.

1275
00:45:30.668 --> 00:45:33.548
Or personal choices about education.

1276
00:45:33.548 --> 00:45:35.747
Or whether I as an adult

1277
00:45:35.747 --> 00:45:39.000
wish responsibly in the privacy of my own home

1278
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.048
to explore the mystery of my consciousness

1279
00:45:41.048 --> 00:45:42.595
with ancient and sacred plants

1280
00:45:42.595 --> 00:45:43.950
that have been in use by shamans

1281
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.550
for tens of thousands of years.

1282
00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:47.011
I don't believe the state has any business

1283
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:52.011
sticking its all seeing eye into my living room either.

1284
00:45:52.515 --> 00:45:56.163
And I do feel very, very strongly

1285
00:45:56.163 --> 00:45:57.528
and I'd like to make this statement

1286
00:45:57.528 --> 00:46:00.365
that if we live in a society that does not allow us

1287
00:46:00.365 --> 00:46:03.757
as adults, to be sovereign over our own consciousness,

1288
00:46:03.757 --> 00:46:05.474
then we shouldn't imagine that we're sovereign

1289
00:46:05.474 --> 00:46:06.542
over anything at all.

1290
00:46:06.542 --> 00:46:07.662
We have no freedom.

1291
00:46:07.662 --> 00:46:09.422
Any freedom we have is an illusion,

1292
00:46:09.422 --> 00:46:11.534
if we do not have sovereignty

1293
00:46:11.534 --> 00:46:13.837
over this most precious, this most intimate,

1294
00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:16.717
this most significant and important part

1295
00:46:16.717 --> 00:46:18.082
of ourselves.

1296
00:46:18.082 --> 00:46:20.472
Sovereignty over consciousness is everything.

1297
00:46:20.472 --> 00:46:23.149
I believe there's a war on consciousness

1298
00:46:23.149 --> 00:46:25.218
underway in our societies.

1299
00:46:25.218 --> 00:46:29.111
You know it's not illegal to watch reality tv,

1300
00:46:29.111 --> 00:46:32.247
but consider what reality tv is doing to our children.

1301
00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:36.108
Consider the way it's turning our brains to mush,

1302
00:46:36.108 --> 00:46:40.652
causing us to focus on endless trivia and meaninglessness.

1303
00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:43.276
And distracting us from the true

1304
00:46:43.276 --> 00:46:45.974
and important issues of life.

1305
00:46:45.974 --> 00:46:48.801
So I feel this issue of consciousness

1306
00:46:48.801 --> 00:46:51.478
actually touches on the future direction

1307
00:46:51.478 --> 00:46:55.072
that our society is going to go in,

1308
00:46:55.072 --> 00:46:58.165
and it's very important I feel

1309
00:46:58.165 --> 00:46:59.435
that people wake up to this

1310
00:46:59.435 --> 00:47:01.066
and take command, and take control

1311
00:47:01.066 --> 00:47:02.337
of their own consciousness again.

1312
00:47:02.337 --> 00:47:05.888
And resist the incredibly sophisticated

1313
00:47:05.888 --> 00:47:08.192
mechanisms of mind control

1314
00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:10.635
that operate in our society.

1315
00:47:10.635 --> 00:47:12.928
Many feel today that we're poised

1316
00:47:12.928 --> 00:47:14.549
on the edge of an abyss.

1317
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:16.416
That's there some great darkness

1318
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.250
coming down the line.

1319
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:20.031
If we're going to resist that,

1320
00:47:20.031 --> 00:47:21.610
we must be in control

1321
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:22.560
of our own consciousness.

1322
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.970
We must assert and defend,

1323
00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.594
and insist on our right

1324
00:47:27.594 --> 00:47:29.151
to freedom of consciousness,

1325
00:47:29.151 --> 00:47:31.007
our fundamental human right

1326
00:47:31.007 --> 00:47:32.309
to freedom of consciousness.

1327
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:34.474
And although we as individuals may not

1328
00:47:34.474 --> 00:47:38.399
be able to affect the wider society directly,

1329
00:47:38.399 --> 00:47:39.999
what we do have control of

1330
00:47:39.999 --> 00:47:42.996
is the way that we lead our own personal lives

1331
00:47:42.996 --> 00:47:45.385
and the way that we act towards others,

1332
00:47:45.385 --> 00:47:46.750
and behave towards others.

1333
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.190
We do have control over that.

1334
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.123
We can make the right choices over that.

1335
00:47:51.123 --> 00:47:54.110
We are sovereign over ourselves.

1336
00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:55.838
And if we make the right choices there,

1337
00:47:55.838 --> 00:47:57.598
and if enough of us do that

1338
00:47:57.598 --> 00:48:00.179
then that descending darkness can be banished,

1339
00:48:00.179 --> 00:48:02.771
and the light can come back in.

1340
00:48:04.161 --> 00:48:05.001
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1341
00:48:05.001 --> 00:48:06.259
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1342
00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:09.672
(soft music)

1343
00:48:09.672 --> 00:48:12.317
<v ->For a little background on his work with ayahuasca,</v>

1344
00:48:12.317 --> 00:48:14.173

1346
00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:17.448
Meanwhile Entangled is just the ticket

1347
00:48:17.448 --> 00:48:20.274
for anyone who wants a faster and more fun-pace

1348
00:48:20.274 --> 00:48:21.885
to their science lessons.

1349
00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:24.295
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
