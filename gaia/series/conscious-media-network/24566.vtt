00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.003 line:15% 
(soothing music)

2
00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.893
<v ->With all the buzz surrounding the year 2012,</v>

3
00:00:16.893 --> 00:00:19.863
I decided to check in with our wise woman astrologer,

4
00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:21.493
Jessica Murray, once again.

5
00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:24.123
Jessica is not a predictive astrologer.

6
00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.743
Rather, she evaluates the overall trends that are set

7
00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:30.033
into motion under the larger astrological alignments.

8
00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.303
In this sense, 2012 has some major alignments

9
00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:36.263
that would put it alongside the Mayan and Hopi calendars

10
00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:38.213
in the profundity of the times.

11
00:00:40.113 --> 00:00:41.722
Jessica, it's so good to see you.

12
00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:44.385
I mean, I saw you in 2010, and I saw you before that.

13
00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:47.105
This is the first time in 2011,

14
00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:50.025
and here we are on the last few days of the year,

15
00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.575
and I thought we'd start out by talking about,

16
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:54.965
just for a couple minutes,

17
00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:58.065
'cause I know we have a lot to talk about about 2012.

18
00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:01.893
2011, what were some of the hallmarks

19
00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:04.903
that you were expecting at the beginning of the year,

20
00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:07.593
and what did you actually see happen?

21
00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:10.630
<v ->It's so funny because I just reread</v>

22
00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:15.434
this woman who asks me to do a little rundown

23
00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:18.153
of the year to come every year,

24
00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:18.933
and it's on the web,

25
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:23.413
and of course I always qualify that I don't do predictions.

26
00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:27.623
I just am in the kind of astrology that looks at trends

27
00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:31.633
and energy streams that could go any number of ways,

28
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.803
depending on the consciousness of the person,

29
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:39.273
of the group, but I still saw what every astrologer saw,

30
00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:42.173
which is that the Uranus in the sky,

31
00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:45.813
which is the planet of revolution and abrupt disruption,

32
00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:50.490
and Pluto in the sky, which is a planet of breakdown,

33
00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:54.777
destruction, crunching down to bare bones

34
00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:56.697
so that something else can be born.

35
00:01:58.157 --> 00:01:59.337
We've all known for years

36
00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:00.877
that these two planets were gonna be

37
00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:04.497
in this acute angle called a square, 90 degrees apart,

38
00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:07.247
and so everyone was talking about,

39
00:02:07.247 --> 00:02:09.887
all astrologers were talking about

40
00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:12.605
governmental systems were going to be

41
00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:18.045
threatened in terms of their verticality.

42
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.010
This is what Capricorn, the sign Pluto is in,

43
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.390
is really about, is the type of authoritative system

44
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.811
that goes in a ladder, vertical, top-down.

45
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.730
So you can think of patriarchy does that,

46
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.490
and the kind of corporate structures

47
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.020
that we assume is the only way to manage things,

48
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.442
they do that.

49
00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:40.302
The vertical type of

50
00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:43.342
managing people in society,

51
00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:46.592
Capricorn, was going to be abruptly challenged

52
00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:49.862
by forces, and Uranus is in Aries,

53
00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:51.712
the sign of activism.

54
00:02:51.712 --> 00:02:53.002
<v Regina>Mmm.</v>

55
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:56.002
<v ->And then we got, right at the autumn equinox,</v>

56
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:58.762
when the square was tipped off,

57
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.712
astrologers had been waiting for it.

58
00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:03.502
You know, the progressive movement had been waiting for it,

59
00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.922
the left had been waiting for it.

60
00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:09.462
The one-percenters have been dreading it.

61
00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:11.902
And it all came about, even to the point

62
00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:16.072
of the Occupy Wall Street people making

63
00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:18.682
a very stringent point about,

64
00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:20.283
they were cutting down the verticality

65
00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.012
to a horizontality.

66
00:03:22.012 --> 00:03:22.662
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

67
00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:24.192
<v ->With their wonderful general</v>

68
00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:25.312
assemblies.
<v Regina>I've heard</v>

69
00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:26.492
literal response to the times.

70
00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:28.562
<v ->Human mic.</v>

71
00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.136
And they talked about it, in terms of horizontalism.

72
00:03:31.136 --> 00:03:35.576
So that, it was so delightful to see

73
00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:40.510
something erupt that cleaves so tightly

74
00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:43.336
to the symbolism,

75
00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:44.636
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->in the sky.</v>

76
00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:45.696
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

77
00:03:45.696 --> 00:03:47.616
<v ->There's another thing going on and that is,</v>

78
00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:53.096
you and I sat together right when

79
00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.356
Pluto went into Capricorn and astrologists were

80
00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.056
talking about the banking system is

81
00:03:57.056 --> 00:03:59.096
going to show it's colors.

82
00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:01.796
It's different than a straight collapse.

83
00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:05.106
The collapse was of, really of denial.

84
00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:06.846
It's not that it just started,

85
00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:10.166
that Wall Street just started to do those tricks in 2008.

86
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:13.666
But what happened was it broke through the crust

87
00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:16.016
of public awareness.

88
00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:20.376
And we knew that a certain number of

89
00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:22.236
years after that was going to be the next

90
00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:24.011
step for that to happen.

91
00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:26.936
And, of course, 2011 set it up

92
00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.737
for reasons I won't bore you with,

93
00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:30.946
in terms of specific

94
00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:33.026
aspects in the sky.

95
00:04:33.036 --> 00:04:36.306
And 2012 will be the next

96
00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:38.696
radical upping of the ante

97
00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:41.787
about the banks, about monetary systems.

98
00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:44.966
<v Regina>So that uh,</v>

99
00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:46.736
in a nutshell we have seen all of that

100
00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:48.136
come to pass thus far,

101
00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:49.556
and I think you've already captured

102
00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.476
people's curiosity here,

103
00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:53.856
because this is the next thing I wanted

104
00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.196
to discuss with you.

105
00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:58.666
We've also released another little video this month

106
00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:00.976
that could have some profound impacts,

107
00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:03.556
or it could be, we have to wait and see

108
00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:05.756
how much truth is in it.

109
00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:08.006
But it was stating that

110
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:11.296
there is a new system of economy

111
00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:13.257
that is behind the scenes.

112
00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:16.074
Has been formed behind the scenes,

113
00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:19.123
is going to be rising to our consciousness,

114
00:05:19.123 --> 00:05:21.433
that is going to radically change

115
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:23.034
the way banking is done.

116
00:05:23.034 --> 00:05:25.644
And the world economy's interact with each other

117
00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:26.954
and with human beings.

118
00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:27.654
<v ->Yeah.</v>

119
00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:30.933
<v Regina>And so, what are you seeing</v>

120
00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:32.372
in that same world?

121
00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:37.034
<v ->There are two exact hits, as we say,</v>

122
00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:39.754
of this angle up in the sky this year,

123
00:05:39.754 --> 00:05:41.174
and it's Pluto's square,

124
00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.794
that all the astrologies are hopped up about.

125
00:05:43.714 --> 00:05:46.334
And we have been waiting for it for years,

126
00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:48.156
really since the mid-60s,

127
00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:51.286
when these two planets conjoin in the sky.

128
00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.047
We've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.

129
00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:56.955
That's how big it is, that's how rare it is.

130
00:05:56.955 --> 00:06:01.195
And world-altering, a transit like this is.

131
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.725
The first two hits of 'em are coming in 2012

132
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.469
and from Western Astrology's point of view,

133
00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:13.845
that's what puts 2012 on the map, mostly.

134
00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:17.755
You know, the Hopi prophecies and the Mayan tradition

135
00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:19.865
have their point of view.

136
00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:22.625
And, of course, none of us think that it's an accident

137
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:25.685
that all these different wisdom path traditions

138
00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.835
tend to line up around this calendar year.

139
00:06:28.835 --> 00:06:30.705
But from Western Astrology's point of view,

140
00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:33.505
we're looking at the June 24th exactitude.

141
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.285
And one in September.

142
00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:42.065
Mind you, we don't look at those exact dates

143
00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:43.505
as meaning that you're going to

144
00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:44.885
wake up in the morning and some event's

145
00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:45.965
gonna happen.

146
00:06:45.965 --> 00:06:48.125
But there's kind of like an epicenter in time.

147
00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:52.345
And when they hit, that's when we

148
00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:55.485
expect the intensity to probably show up

149
00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:58.035
in events, or at the next full moon.

150
00:06:58.035 --> 00:06:59.465
So all these things are tracked out

151
00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:01.615
in a very technical way.

152
00:07:01.615 --> 00:07:06.145
But this is when also Venus does

153
00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:09.915
an interesting, very rare thing called an occultation.

154
00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:13.362
Venus governs money.

155
00:07:13.362 --> 00:07:15.906
And it is associated in mundane astrology

156
00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:17.378
with banking.

157
00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:22.416
And there is, a kind of supporting meaning, therefore,

158
00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:25.666
that the Venus occultation will also,

159
00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:28.055
which is in early June of 2012,

160
00:07:29.336 --> 00:07:31.526
have something to do with it because

161
00:07:31.526 --> 00:07:34.022
the last time it did something like this,

162
00:07:34.022 --> 00:07:36.512
they happen in pairs eight years apart,

163
00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:38.512
was 2004.

164
00:07:38.512 --> 00:07:42.002
2008 was the midpoint of the one

165
00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:43.482
that's happening this year and the one

166
00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:45.082
that happened then.

167
00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:48.602
And 2008, is associated, therefore, with astrologers,

168
00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:53.272
by astrologers, with this banking cataclysm, too.

169
00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:57.722
And so, June is cracking up to be

170
00:07:57.722 --> 00:08:00.682
a very important month to 2012,

171
00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:03.052
from many points of view.

172
00:08:04.402 --> 00:08:05.613
And it's right in the middle.

173
00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:09.462
So if we could think of time, as if it were spacial,

174
00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:13.842
and then you kind of drop a pebble in water

175
00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:15.602
and it ripples out like that,

176
00:08:15.602 --> 00:08:18.762
that's the way my kind of astrology looks at time.

177
00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:23.602
So this is a very big deal.

178
00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:25.632
We don't know specifically,

179
00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:28.372
we never know specifically what it's gonna mean.

180
00:08:28.372 --> 00:08:30.940
But we know by the rarity of something,

181
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.099
that it's gonna be world-altering.

182
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.780
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

183
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.540
And you can tell where the cracks

184
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.540
in the system already exist,

185
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.800
that there will be additional stress applied

186
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.440
in those areas, so maybe we only need to

187
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.800
look around to where the stress fractures

188
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.960
already are and that'll give us an idea of

189
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.890
what may be coming?

190
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.980
<v ->Yeah, but I think from the point of view of</v>

191
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.710
humanistic astrology what we look at

192
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.690
more than that, is what it means.

193
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.400
In the big picture, in kind of the esoteric

194
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.820
level of meaning of this.

195
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.220
It's about value.

196
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.576
And there's a wonderful thinker,

197
00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:16.846
he's a professor of something in Austin.

198
00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:18.475
Have you ever heard of Robert Jensen?

199
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.116
<v Regina>No, I don't think I have.</v>

200
00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:21.195
<v ->University of Texas?</v>

201
00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:22.656
<v Regina>I don't believe I have, no.</v>

202
00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:25.616
<v ->He has a stunningly beautiful YouTube video</v>

203
00:09:25.616 --> 00:09:29.115
on how the value of the human being has

204
00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:31.016
been degenerated.

205
00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.896
He's not an astrologer,

206
00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:35.296
but I was watching his lecture,

207
00:09:35.296 --> 00:09:38.315
and he hit all the points that these transits

208
00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:40.507
in the sky, imply.

209
00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:44.336
So this whole notion of value.

210
00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:45.756
Another layer of it is that,

211
00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:49.152
Venus in the USA charge,

212
00:09:49.152 --> 00:09:50.973
is being opposed by Venus.

213
00:09:50.973 --> 00:09:53.893
And has been since 2008.

214
00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.693
Now, we, in this materialistic culture

215
00:09:56.693 --> 00:10:00.417
tend to equate value with material value.

216
00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:04.664
And that's not to be dismissed.

217
00:10:04.664 --> 00:10:07.624
That suggests that for this populous,

218
00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:11.104
it probably will manifest that way,

219
00:10:11.104 --> 00:10:12.614
because these are the terms that the

220
00:10:12.614 --> 00:10:15.484
mass mind understands it on.

221
00:10:15.484 --> 00:10:19.399
So I'm thinking with the Venus of the,

222
00:10:20.604 --> 00:10:22.374
in the USA chart, I especially look

223
00:10:22.374 --> 00:10:24.074
at America's karma,

224
00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:26.834
because it's very closely tied in

225
00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.734
with the Uranus-Pluto square.

226
00:10:28.734 --> 00:10:29.974
I talk about it in my book.

227
00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:31.435
<v Voiceover>Yeah, Soul-Sick Nation, yes.</v>

228
00:10:31.435 --> 00:10:34.335
<v ->I have the USA chart in that book to show</v>

229
00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:37.985
you that, what is already an incredibly tense

230
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:40.095
configuration in the sky,

231
00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:42.435
two planets that have a, you know,

232
00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:43.875
a 90 degree angle.

233
00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:46.835
When it's opposed upon the US natal chart,

234
00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:49.917
the entity born July 4th, 1776,

235
00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:54.294
it becomes what we call a grand cross,

236
00:10:54.294 --> 00:10:59.144
which is the most stressful configuration in astrology.

237
00:10:59.144 --> 00:11:02.075
So I do think that the USA is going to be

238
00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:04.034
a major player,

239
00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:07.334
in this breakdown slash renewal,

240
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.014
that has to happen.

241
00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:11.524
I do think that populous movements,

242
00:11:12.474 --> 00:11:15.204
I mean, this is what I said in those quote, unquote,

243
00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:17.874
"predictions" that I was just reading the other day,

244
00:11:17.874 --> 00:11:21.134
that I wrote, before there was anything,

245
00:11:21.134 --> 00:11:25.494
before there was any whiff of a genuine, radical uprising

246
00:11:25.494 --> 00:11:28.934
like we've seen with mostly young people from Occupy.

247
00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:32.314
The activism of it comes from the Aries.

248
00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:34.314
The populous of it comes from Uranus,

249
00:11:34.314 --> 00:11:36.309
which is the planet of democracy.

250
00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:41.649
Pluto, no surprise, is the planet of plutocracy.

251
00:11:42.874 --> 00:11:44.374
<v Regina>Indirectly opposing each other.</v>

252
00:11:44.374 --> 00:11:45.614
<v ->They're in conflict.
<v Regina>In conflict, yes.</v>

253
00:11:45.614 --> 00:11:47.294
<v ->They're squaring each other.</v>

254
00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:49.094
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

255
00:11:49.094 --> 00:11:52.214
So, we understand this, from what we see

256
00:11:52.214 --> 00:11:54.314
everyday in the headlines, the Occupy movement

257
00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:56.734
and also around the world, around the globe,

258
00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:58.794
all over the countries in the Middle East.

259
00:11:58.794 --> 00:12:00.034
<v ->China.</v>

260
00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:01.994
<v Regina>China, let's talk about China.</v>

261
00:12:01.994 --> 00:12:03.154
<v ->China.</v>

262
00:12:03.154 --> 00:12:04.094
What a trip.

263
00:12:04.094 --> 00:12:06.934
It has a configuration in Libra,

264
00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:09.734
in it's chart, it's 1949 chart.

265
00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:13.343
Which is exactly on the same degrees

266
00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:15.994
of some of the planets in the USA chart.

267
00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:19.364
It's being hit in the cross-hairs in a similar way.

268
00:12:20.454 --> 00:12:22.534
And so we have, as we don't have to

269
00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.904
be an astrologer to be able to see,

270
00:12:24.904 --> 00:12:27.394
these two super powers, now

271
00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:28.754
vying for supremacy, really.

272
00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:32.654
China is kind of lined up to be, you know,

273
00:12:32.654 --> 00:12:37.244
the big dog in the global hegemony department.

274
00:12:37.244 --> 00:12:40.575
But there's so many contradictions between

275
00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:42.674
what's going on in China.

276
00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.494
<v Regina>Elaborate.</v>

277
00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:47.844
<v ->And the way that, at least Americans think about it,</v>

278
00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:50.214
I think that Americans are more politically,

279
00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:54.634
GO politically, naive than most countries in the world.

280
00:12:54.634 --> 00:12:56.274
<v Regina>I think that's fair to say.</v>

281
00:12:56.274 --> 00:12:58.974
<v ->But there's still kind of this</v>

282
00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:02.284
illusion left over from the Cold War years

283
00:13:02.284 --> 00:13:05.794
that China is bad because it's communist,

284
00:13:05.794 --> 00:13:07.534
and, of course, we know it's the most

285
00:13:07.534 --> 00:13:11.716
rip-roaringly capitalist country in the world right now.

286
00:13:12.794 --> 00:13:16.084
It's out-capitalisticing the USA by far.

287
00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:19.984
And this business of disapproving.

288
00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:21.674
You know how the mass mind thinks of China,

289
00:13:21.674 --> 00:13:25.904
and how the idiots on the cable news shows

290
00:13:25.904 --> 00:13:30.764
will play to these ideas that their Godless communists.

291
00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:35.104
It's about 50 to 25 years behind,

292
00:13:35.104 --> 00:13:38.254
in terms of the reality, the reality of power.

293
00:13:38.254 --> 00:13:40.174
The reality of us being a trillion dollars

294
00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:43.794
in hawk to them.

295
00:13:43.794 --> 00:13:48.664
So when you see a country having an image,

296
00:13:48.664 --> 00:13:51.994
in the collective consciousness that's so out of whack,

297
00:13:51.994 --> 00:13:54.376
with what's happening economically,

298
00:13:56.214 --> 00:13:57.854
you know that there's gonna be

299
00:13:57.854 --> 00:14:01.734
a more painful rupture when

300
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:03.314
what has to happen, happens.

301
00:14:03.314 --> 00:14:05.784
Which is that the reality's going to have to catch up

302
00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:07.974
with the myths and the mass mind.

303
00:14:07.974 --> 00:14:11.208
This is what's really going on, energetically,

304
00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:13.448
with the Uranus-Pluto square.

305
00:14:13.448 --> 00:14:15.968
As it, people's thinking are in a relatively

306
00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:19.268
accelerated way, in various countries

307
00:14:19.268 --> 00:14:21.888
at various speeds, but, globally

308
00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:23.776
'cause we're all under the same sky.

309
00:14:25.758 --> 00:14:27.648
These ideas that are now,

310
00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:28.828
that are happening now,

311
00:14:28.828 --> 00:14:30.668
the truth of what's happening now,

312
00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:33.168
is going to break through all kinds of

313
00:14:33.168 --> 00:14:34.692
national myths.

314
00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:38.614
In a relatively sudden way.

315
00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:41.448
And the relatively sudden comes

316
00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:42.748
from the Uranus factor.

317
00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.878
Uranus and Aries is,

318
00:14:44.878 --> 00:14:46.458
is an abruptness.

319
00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.448
Which, if we look at the last time

320
00:14:48.448 --> 00:14:51.898
we had a transit like this in 1965, 66--

321
00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:54.168
<v Regina>Times of revolution, yes.</v>

322
00:14:54.168 --> 00:14:56.348
<v ->Times of revolution and they happened,</v>

323
00:14:56.348 --> 00:14:58.128
it seemed like it happened in wild,

324
00:14:58.128 --> 00:15:01.688
like a wildfire, without taking the years

325
00:15:01.688 --> 00:15:02.596
to sort of,

326
00:15:04.476 --> 00:15:07.808
move, percolate in the mass mind.

327
00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.598
That's the kind of change we're looking at, here.

328
00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:13.948
<v ->Now, we look at, we were talking about</v>

329
00:15:13.948 --> 00:15:18.728
the reality that many Americans suffer

330
00:15:18.728 --> 00:15:21.748
from a type of denial or even delusion,

331
00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:26.218
that is going to be shown to each one of us this year.

332
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:29.158
And we're going to be faced with our own

333
00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:31.668
disinformation that we've been running through

334
00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:33.148
our filters.
<v ->That's right.</v>

335
00:15:33.148 --> 00:15:35.408
Disinformation is what it is.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

336
00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:40.208
<v ->So I do see a backlash coming.</v>

337
00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:42.648
And the American mass media is probably

338
00:15:42.648 --> 00:15:44.168
the headquarters for this.

339
00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:46.898
They are the organ for what,

340
00:15:46.898 --> 00:15:48.748
the government, who are the organ

341
00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:50.538
for the corporations,

342
00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:52.758
want disseminated.

343
00:15:52.758 --> 00:15:56.828
So I tell my students about working with

344
00:15:56.828 --> 00:15:58.768
what we call the Neptune factor,

345
00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:02.608
which is illusion, delusion,

346
00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:04.168
and the kind of fear reactivity

347
00:16:04.168 --> 00:16:06.628
that comes off of that.

348
00:16:06.628 --> 00:16:08.688
So we say that Neptune governs fear,

349
00:16:08.688 --> 00:16:10.838
but there are many types of fear.

350
00:16:10.838 --> 00:16:13.028
And the type I'm talking about here,

351
00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:17.275
has to do with sort of hopping on the bandwagon

352
00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:20.506
of these stories that are pumped out,

353
00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:22.726
mostly through the media, also through advertising,

354
00:16:22.726 --> 00:16:25.636
which is also governed by Neptune.

355
00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:28.206
Which, after all, governs hypnosis of all kinds.

356
00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:32.922
And, you know, submersing, being immersed

357
00:16:32.922 --> 00:16:35.742
like water, Neptune governs floods and,

358
00:16:35.742 --> 00:16:39.362
water disasters is another issue we can talk about.

359
00:16:39.362 --> 00:16:43.862
But when I think about the energy of flooding,

360
00:16:43.862 --> 00:16:48.683
the energetic, non-literal expression of Neptune,

361
00:16:49.771 --> 00:16:53.389
which begins the year conjunct the US moon,

362
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:56.208
which is the mass mood.

363
00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:58.159
So that's why I'm particularly looking

364
00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.699
at this country with it.

365
00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:04.039
You see that there's almost a bewitching going on.

366
00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:07.018
And a tendency to want to take the

367
00:17:07.018 --> 00:17:09.084
easy path and go to sleep,

368
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:13.564
in terms of these nonsense issues that

369
00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:17.164
the news talks about.

370
00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:18.164
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

371
00:17:18.164 --> 00:17:19.484
<v ->While they are, meanwhile, completely</v>

372
00:17:19.484 --> 00:17:22.324
blacking out where the money really is.

373
00:17:22.324 --> 00:17:25.394
<v Regina>Well, it's manufacturing a mindset</v>

374
00:17:25.394 --> 00:17:27.644
that is totally out of alignment with reality

375
00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:28.724
on both sides.

376
00:17:28.724 --> 00:17:30.884
If you take the preoccupation with the media,

377
00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.983
for example, with infotainment,

378
00:17:33.983 --> 00:17:35.404
you know, your news shows,

379
00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:37.464
which are entertainment essentially.

380
00:17:37.464 --> 00:17:40.024
The objective there seems to be

381
00:17:40.024 --> 00:17:42.684
to enslave people to their emotions.

382
00:17:42.684 --> 00:17:45.263
It projects the world as a much more

383
00:17:45.263 --> 00:17:47.524
dangerous place, than if you were to

384
00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:49.484
look at the statistics, it really is.

385
00:17:49.484 --> 00:17:51.924
<v ->Well, I think it's going to crank up.</v>

386
00:17:51.924 --> 00:17:53.823
<v Regina>Well, yes, you're right.</v>

387
00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.404
<v ->And we look at the Neptune,</v>

388
00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:58.394
Mars spends an extraordinary eight months

389
00:17:58.394 --> 00:18:03.054
in Virgo in 2012, which is just very unusual.

390
00:18:03.054 --> 00:18:03.964
<v Regina>Is that painful?</v>

391
00:18:03.964 --> 00:18:04.644
It sounds

392
00:18:04.644 --> 00:18:05.543
painful.
<v Jessica>Well I'm looking</v>

393
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.564
in terms of what we're talking about now.

394
00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:11.584
It's going to hit that US Neptune,

395
00:18:11.584 --> 00:18:13.324
and it's going to trigger the part of

396
00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:15.724
the US consciousness,

397
00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:19.433
which goes as a default to the distraction

398
00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:21.123
that you're talking about.

399
00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:25.344
To be distracted and fall into free-floating anxiety.

400
00:18:25.344 --> 00:18:27.484
And Neptune is an emotional planet.

401
00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:31.541
So it's interesting that the

402
00:18:31.541 --> 00:18:34.660
intellect and the use of reason

403
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.221
is very difficult for the

404
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:39.151
collective entity that is the USA.

405
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:41.291
We have Saturn in Libra,

406
00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:43.761
and it doesn't feel smart,

407
00:18:43.761 --> 00:18:45.980
in terms of using reason

408
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.630
and accumulating facts.

409
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:51.411
But those are exactly the types of

410
00:18:51.411 --> 00:18:53.171
things that people could do.

411
00:18:53.171 --> 00:18:54.950
And we don't have to buy into

412
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.121
the collective hypnosis.

413
00:18:57.121 --> 00:18:59.569
That's why, with a little boost from our will,

414
00:19:00.651 --> 00:19:03.521
being rooted in our own individual chart,

415
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:05.520
in our own intelligence,

416
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.490
and our own sense of why we incarnated

417
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.070
in these tumultuous times.

418
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.391
You actually don't have to be rooted in that.

419
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:15.361
So I'm looking at kind of two different things here.

420
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:17.471
I'm looking at the default position that I think

421
00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:20.391
will happen in the public consciousness.

422
00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:21.251
And I'm also--

423
00:19:21.251 --> 00:19:22.790
<v Regina>Which is to take the easy way out.</v>

424
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.611
<v ->Yes, who aren't individualized.</v>

425
00:19:24.611 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Regina>Yes, to attempt to sleep through it.</v>

426
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.491
<v ->They will not,</v>

427
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:31.270
unfortunately, I think they'll react through it.

428
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.470
Because what I think will happen

429
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.510
with the Uranus-Pluto square,

430
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.391
is that the powers that be are

431
00:19:37.391 --> 00:19:40.251
gonna give it their all.

432
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:44.111
They're going to forget this kindler, gentler plutocracy,

433
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:48.108
and just be straight up obvious Plutocrats.

434
00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:53.390
So that, you know, the censorship of the internet,

435
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.211
which they haven't dared touch before,

436
00:19:55.211 --> 00:19:56.831
so there's now something in Congress,

437
00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:57.540
I'm sure you've heard

438
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.541
of it.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

439
00:19:58.541 --> 00:20:00.571
<v ->Which is trying to use copyright regulations</v>

440
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.405
to derive a blacklist.

441
00:20:05.181 --> 00:20:07.150
And, you know, the Citizens United was

442
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.071
another thing that we saw.

443
00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:10.231
Something like that would happen,

444
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:13.891
this horrible Supreme Court ruling that

445
00:20:13.891 --> 00:20:17.270
made explicit what is always been implicit.

446
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:21.420
Which is that, corporations are people,

447
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.651
and are more valued than human beings.

448
00:20:24.651 --> 00:20:27.541
So this idea that money is behind elections

449
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:29.011
is no longer somebody's rumor,

450
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:30.911
it became law.

451
00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:33.811
And that, with the internet thing,

452
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:36.691
and there's also this unspeakable thing,

453
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:39.790
which so far, Obama has pledged to veto,

454
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.801
but we will see, that wants to,

455
00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:43.831
do you want to say the word?

456
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:44.731
<v Regina>No, you go ahead.</v>

457
00:20:44.731 --> 00:20:47.631
<v ->Well we know those of us who want</v>

458
00:20:47.631 --> 00:20:49.960
to cleave to the constitution,

459
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.260
even the Magna Carta.

460
00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.880
I mean, this idea that one is charged

461
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.920
with a crime before one is incarcerated,

462
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.140
and on US soil and a US citizen.

463
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.479
I mean, it's like saying yes to Guantanamo Bay

464
00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:04.709
right here at home.

465
00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:09.230
I think that these are signs of the Pluto factor,

466
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.960
as I call it, which is that the Plutocrats

467
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.140
taking off the gloves.

468
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.020
On the other hand, with this exactitude,

469
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.360
you know, the peaking of the intensity

470
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.470
of the forces of, really democracy

471
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.030
and plutocracy coming together

472
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.058
in a conflicting angle, the most conflicting

473
00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:35.467
angle in astrology.

474
00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:39.158
It's not gonna be a slam dunk for the Plutocrats.

475
00:21:40.248 --> 00:21:44.178
There's going to be a lot more occupied-type protests.

476
00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:47.577
You can't put those worms back in the can.

477
00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:48.918
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

478
00:21:51.108 --> 00:21:53.032
<v ->So I think that the meaning of it,</v>

479
00:21:53.032 --> 00:21:55.567
is that the systems we've got going

480
00:21:56.981 --> 00:22:01.012
can't cope with the realities of the world right now.

481
00:22:01.012 --> 00:22:01.872
And these

482
00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:06.672
modest, little proposals that happened

483
00:22:06.672 --> 00:22:10.027
when the G20 get together on climate change.

484
00:22:11.302 --> 00:22:14.411
Which are about a third of what needs to happen.

485
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:17.170
And they're still being fought tooth and nail.

486
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.830
And China, as I've implied,

487
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.820
it really is also going to be in the cross-hairs

488
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.700
of what we call the cardinal cross,

489
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.420
this major transit.

490
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.890
It's not gonna get away with anything either.

491
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.700
So, I'm not, don't let your viewers take from this

492
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.569
that I'm saying it's gonna be the next

493
00:22:37.569 --> 00:22:39.692
hegemon and it's gonna be the,

494
00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:41.322
a slam dunk for them.

495
00:22:41.322 --> 00:22:42.338
They have a lot of internal problems.

496
00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:43.058
<v Regina>Because they're being presented</v>

497
00:22:43.058 --> 00:22:44.838
with very similar challenges.

498
00:22:44.838 --> 00:22:47.748
<v ->Yes, and they're at a different place with it.</v>

499
00:22:47.748 --> 00:22:50.218
They have a crudeness about it.

500
00:22:50.218 --> 00:22:52.198
And they're far ahead of us,

501
00:22:52.198 --> 00:22:53.798
in terms of internet censorship,

502
00:22:53.798 --> 00:22:57.288
but they have so many people that they can't

503
00:22:57.288 --> 00:23:00.326
keep those worms in the can very well.

504
00:23:01.398 --> 00:23:02.858
Here's what I want to say about China

505
00:23:02.858 --> 00:23:04.606
before we leave that topic.

506
00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:09.345
They are blinded

507
00:23:09.345 --> 00:23:12.528
by the capitalistic

508
00:23:12.528 --> 00:23:14.806
blood in the nostrils.

509
00:23:14.806 --> 00:23:16.775
You know, they're just kind of going for it

510
00:23:16.775 --> 00:23:21.015
without a lot of systemic, without any systemic

511
00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:24.716
regulatory agencies in place.

512
00:23:24.716 --> 00:23:27.906
And the way they're pumping out pollution,

513
00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.133
everyone is tisk, tisking about it.

514
00:23:31.196 --> 00:23:33.425
The interesting thing is they're also

515
00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:36.956
the world leader in solar and sustainable.

516
00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:39.595
<v Regina>I was just going to ask you about that, yes.</v>

517
00:23:39.595 --> 00:23:41.376
<v ->It's just a nest of ironies.
<v Regina>And we just learned</v>

518
00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:44.415
that they actually have, um,

519
00:23:44.415 --> 00:23:47.685
they've embraced, um, cold fusion.

520
00:23:47.685 --> 00:23:48.155
<v ->Yes.</v>

521
00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:50.475
<v Regina>And this is part of their energetic profile,</v>

522
00:23:50.475 --> 00:23:52.076
which is not in any
<v Jessica>That's right.</v>

523
00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:53.776
<v Regina>other country, just yet.</v>

524
00:23:53.776 --> 00:23:55.775
<v ->It's so interesting, and we can say,</v>

525
00:23:55.775 --> 00:23:56.935
"Well, it's because they want to be

526
00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:59.105
number one in everything, fine."

527
00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:01.576
That's something to be number one in.

528
00:24:01.576 --> 00:24:04.016
So, just to go to say, we have no idea

529
00:24:04.016 --> 00:24:06.945
how that's gonna play out.

530
00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:10.126
You know, Uranus is opposite their sun cluster.

531
00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:11.836
And that Uranus is the planet of

532
00:24:11.836 --> 00:24:13.936
anything can happen.

533
00:24:13.936 --> 00:24:15.415
It governs unpredictability.

534
00:24:15.415 --> 00:24:19.243
But I think that we can look at all these

535
00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:25.691
shifts and cultural earthquakes ahead of us,

536
00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:30.121
with a certain template in mind.

537
00:24:30.121 --> 00:24:31.772
And one of them is,

538
00:24:31.772 --> 00:24:34.581
that to understand what's going on,

539
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:37.891
we need to understand that this is kind of

540
00:24:37.891 --> 00:24:40.371
a post-political world we're in,

541
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:42.731
post-ideological world.

542
00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:45.591
<v Regina>That's an interesting way you put that.</v>

543
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:49.412
<v ->I think that, astrologically, we would say that</v>

544
00:24:49.412 --> 00:24:51.611
what Capricorn governs, which is where Pluto,

545
00:24:51.611 --> 00:24:54.771
the planet of breakdown is in, until 2023--

546
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:57.572
<v Regina>Which is more pragmatic, than idealistic.</v>

547
00:24:57.572 --> 00:24:58.311
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

548
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:00.311
<v ->What it governs in the mundane world</v>

549
00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:03.561
is financial systems and governments.

550
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:07.211
And I think we're seeing a collapse of those two areas.

551
00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:10.851
So that it's a hybrid.

552
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:13.551
I think that 2012 is gonna be the year

553
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:15.811
where we cross the line.

554
00:25:15.811 --> 00:25:18.952
So that it's, it's a post-ideological

555
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:20.951
geopolitics.
<v Regina>And be exposed</v>

556
00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:22.751
for being the coporatocracy that it is.

557
00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:24.191
<v ->That's right, it's exposed.
<v Regina>100% they won't,</v>

558
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:27.172
there will be no attempt to shield us

559
00:25:27.172 --> 00:25:28.432
from that any longer.

560
00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:30.032
<v ->That's what I see happening, but you know,</v>

561
00:25:30.032 --> 00:25:33.192
that's nowhere in the mass mind of the west,

562
00:25:33.192 --> 00:25:34.791
in order to pander to the people

563
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:36.411
and cop votes.

564
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:37.471
<v Regina>Right.</v>

565
00:25:37.471 --> 00:25:38.971
<v ->Politicians still talk in terms of these</v>

566
00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:41.151
platitudes from the Cold War,

567
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:42.631
we're free, they're not.

568
00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:44.511
And it's all about money.

569
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:48.271
The 2008 transits

570
00:25:48.271 --> 00:25:50.351
burst that reality through

571
00:25:50.351 --> 00:25:51.991
and stripped off the facade.

572
00:25:51.991 --> 00:25:53.952
So it's going to be very difficult to keep

573
00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:57.255
that line going, that it's about ideology anymore.

574
00:25:58.271 --> 00:26:00.191
<v Regina>Yes, I think you're right on that.</v>

575
00:26:02.341 --> 00:26:05.671
What about some of the other anomalous

576
00:26:05.671 --> 00:26:08.461
action that's going to be taking place?

577
00:26:08.461 --> 00:26:09.571
I noticed that you had some notes,

578
00:26:09.571 --> 00:26:12.311
and I was looking at one area that I thought

579
00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.771
was interesting, because you were just

580
00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:15.531
bringing this up with the politicians

581
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:17.351
and their platforms and so forth,

582
00:26:17.351 --> 00:26:19.411
that when it comes to election day itself,

583
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.551
it's going to be happening

584
00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:23.351
under Mercury in retrograde?

585
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:24.651
<v ->That very day.</v>

586
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:25.791
<v Regina>That very day.</v>

587
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:27.341
And we know that
<v Jessica>And it's not just</v>

588
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:28.011
happening in the zone.
<v Regina>can be a very</v>

589
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:29.571
challenging situation.

590
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:30.752
It happens three times a year

591
00:26:30.752 --> 00:26:31.971
for about three
<v Jessica>It's</v>

592
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:32.681
extraordinary, right.
<v Regina>weeks.</v>

593
00:26:32.681 --> 00:26:33.681
So it's happening.

594
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:34.521
So let's talk

595
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:35.891
about that for a minute.
<v Jessica>The last time I</v>

596
00:26:35.891 --> 00:26:39.051
know of, that it happened, was 2000.

597
00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:40.979
And we know what a mess that was.

598
00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:44.972
When somebody won, who had lost.

599
00:26:44.972 --> 00:26:47.571
<v ->Yes, so that kind of event is the</v>

600
00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:50.131
hallmark of Mercury in retrograde.

601
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:52.511
<v ->Well, to have it stationed on that day</v>

602
00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:55.051
does make us raise our eyebrows.

603
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:55.911
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

604
00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:59.231
<v ->But I think the way, you probably do also,</v>

605
00:26:59.231 --> 00:27:00.050
that

606
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:05.671
the purpose served by the big election game

607
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:08.151
is more a distraction for the American people, at least,

608
00:27:08.151 --> 00:27:11.121
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->than anything else.</v>

609
00:27:11.121 --> 00:27:14.351
And, I mean, the kind of things that Obama has done.

610
00:27:16.421 --> 00:27:18.351
I hope he listens to his wealthy donors

611
00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:21.311
on that pipeline, because they,

612
00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:23.431
even the people who supported him last time with

613
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:26.791
big money, surrounded the White House, and protested.

614
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.841
It wasn't just scruffy occupiers.

615
00:27:29.841 --> 00:27:32.191
And I do think that he'll pay attention

616
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:33.631
to where the money is,

617
00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:36.341
if there's significant protests from the people.

618
00:27:36.341 --> 00:27:38.991
But the business of making a big hue and cry

619
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:40.871
over the supposed difference between

620
00:27:40.871 --> 00:27:43.301
Republicans and Democrats,

621
00:27:43.301 --> 00:27:47.581
there needs to be a quantum leap in consciousness

622
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:51.315
in the American public, away from that story.

623
00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:54.851
Which consumes an awful lot of time

624
00:27:54.851 --> 00:27:56.711
and an awful lot of money.

625
00:27:56.711 --> 00:27:59.111
<v Regina>I can barely listen to any of the</v>

626
00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:00.831
news outlets any longer.

627
00:28:00.831 --> 00:28:02.011
<v ->Which is--
<v Regina>Playing this</v>

628
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:04.111
charade, years before the election.

629
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:07.251
You have an election, a person is sworn in,

630
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:09.511
and then you're starting to get, already,

631
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:12.531
the campaign analysis for the next election.

632
00:28:12.531 --> 00:28:15.198
It's just a game, a game of preoccupation.

633
00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:17.971
<v ->You can only laugh at it now,</v>

634
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:19.311
it's becoming so absurd.

635
00:28:19.311 --> 00:28:20.511
<v Regina>It's totally absurd.</v>

636
00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:21.951
<v ->Did you see The Onion?</v>

637
00:28:21.951 --> 00:28:22.991
Do you read The Onion?

638
00:28:22.991 --> 00:28:23.991
<v Regina>No, I didn't.</v>

639
00:28:23.991 --> 00:28:25.221
What did they do? Not lately.
<v ->It had to do,</v>

640
00:28:25.221 --> 00:28:27.741
it's a satirical newspaper that has a, um,

641
00:28:27.741 --> 00:28:31.821
a foe headline about Herman Cain.

642
00:28:31.821 --> 00:28:33.451
And it says something like,

643
00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:37.451
candidate has to advocate, give up the election

644
00:28:37.451 --> 00:28:40.351
as the one who, because of extramarital affairs.

645
00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:42.551
This is the guy who didn't know that China

646
00:28:42.551 --> 00:28:43.931
had nuclear weapons.

647
00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:45.291
<v Regina>(laughing) Right.</v>

648
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:48.211
<v ->It was his affairs that made him have to step down.</v>

649
00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:52.091
I mean, I keep thinking that

650
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:54.221
it's gonna become so absurd,

651
00:28:54.221 --> 00:28:58.691
so irrelevant that it will

652
00:28:58.691 --> 00:29:01.691
become obvious to more and more people.

653
00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:04.941
But when I look at that Uranus in Aries,

654
00:29:04.941 --> 00:29:07.371
I also see that,

655
00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:12.840
it's only ever a small group of people, numerically,

656
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.214
that shake the rest awake.

657
00:29:19.214 --> 00:29:23.050
It is if human consciousness works in a bell curve.

658
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.900
And there are only, in any epic like this,

659
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.700
and there really aren't that many in human history,

660
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.960
but in any epic, like in the 60s,

661
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.940
where there's this incredibly disturbing change in these,

662
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.310
the status queue is just fighting for it's life, really.

663
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.843
You're gonna have a, relatively, only a handful

664
00:29:43.843 --> 00:29:46.190
of people, like the Occupiers.

665
00:29:47.182 --> 00:29:51.762
But the brilliance of their message

666
00:29:51.762 --> 00:29:56.582
to make a slogan of 99% and one.

667
00:29:56.582 --> 00:29:57.722
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

668
00:29:57.722 --> 00:30:00.162
<v ->To make a case that it had nothing to do</v>

669
00:30:00.162 --> 00:30:01.482
with Democrat, Republican.

670
00:30:01.482 --> 00:30:02.822
It had nothing to do,

671
00:30:02.822 --> 00:30:04.382
let's just look at the numbers please.

672
00:30:04.382 --> 00:30:05.522
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

673
00:30:05.522 --> 00:30:06.602
<v ->I thought that was
<v Regina>It is.</v>

674
00:30:06.602 --> 00:30:08.022
<v ->the most stunning.
<v Regina>Well done.</v>

675
00:30:08.022 --> 00:30:10.642
<v ->And to have them called unclear</v>

676
00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:13.302
and incoherent by the media, which really didn't know

677
00:30:13.302 --> 00:30:15.362
what to do with them at first.

678
00:30:15.362 --> 00:30:19.072
It's the most coherent battle cry

679
00:30:19.072 --> 00:30:20.702
that we've ever heard.

680
00:30:20.702 --> 00:30:22.062
We are the 99%.

681
00:30:22.062 --> 00:30:23.932
How could that be more coherent?

682
00:30:23.932 --> 00:30:27.652
Exactly to the point, which is what we expect from Pluto.

683
00:30:27.652 --> 00:30:30.022
<v Regina>Well, and there are the few speaking</v>

684
00:30:30.022 --> 00:30:33.342
on behalf of the presumed 99%,

685
00:30:33.342 --> 00:30:35.672
which is probably fair to say.

686
00:30:35.672 --> 00:30:38.742
And yet, at the same time, what's it,

687
00:30:38.742 --> 00:30:41.082
what's this year, we touched on it earlier,

688
00:30:41.082 --> 00:30:43.542
but maybe to be, go into it a little bit more,

689
00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:45.722
what is this you're going to do to those

690
00:30:45.722 --> 00:30:48.802
who are not among the few that are up and active?

691
00:30:48.802 --> 00:30:49.722
<v ->Right.</v>

692
00:30:49.722 --> 00:30:51.802
<v Regina>What is this year going to do?</v>

693
00:30:51.802 --> 00:30:53.362
<v ->It's a very good question.</v>

694
00:30:55.092 --> 00:30:56.541
You know, I,

695
00:30:57.302 --> 00:30:59.182
it's a hard one to answer because

696
00:30:59.182 --> 00:31:03.232
in the last analysis, I look at a person's chart,

697
00:31:04.372 --> 00:31:07.692
and an astrologer will look at this

698
00:31:07.692 --> 00:31:10.502
arrangement of planets when they were born,

699
00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:13.582
as a template of what they can do,

700
00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:15.462
of who they are,

701
00:31:15.462 --> 00:31:17.522
and there's an inference there.

702
00:31:17.522 --> 00:31:20.422
We infer from this abstraction of

703
00:31:20.422 --> 00:31:22.122
different psychic components arranged

704
00:31:22.122 --> 00:31:24.742
in just certain ways.

705
00:31:24.742 --> 00:31:28.669
We infer from that, that their soul made a decision

706
00:31:29.722 --> 00:31:34.302
to incarnate into this epic and none another.

707
00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:36.742
And I think that people,

708
00:31:36.742 --> 00:31:39.652
who even if all they knew about astrology is

709
00:31:39.652 --> 00:31:43.242
people's sun signs, they would see that,

710
00:31:43.242 --> 00:31:45.702
that is an assumption of this belief system.

711
00:31:45.702 --> 00:31:48.532
I mean, you can't really get anything out of astrology

712
00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:51.602
if you don't already, presume that there's a meaning

713
00:31:51.602 --> 00:31:53.202
behind somebody being born in the spring

714
00:31:53.202 --> 00:31:55.962
as a Taurus, instead of in the fall.

715
00:31:55.962 --> 00:31:57.872
So, we can start there and realize

716
00:31:57.872 --> 00:31:59.642
that the birth chart takes that idea

717
00:31:59.642 --> 00:32:02.992
and makes it very much more complex,

718
00:32:02.992 --> 00:32:05.489
so that there's also a meaning,

719
00:32:05.489 --> 00:32:08.449
not just in what season your sun is in,

720
00:32:08.449 --> 00:32:12.149
but in what era you were born in.

721
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:16.206
And what epic you come to adulthood in.

722
00:32:17.286 --> 00:32:19.386
So that, for example, those of us

723
00:32:19.386 --> 00:32:22.726
who were young adults in the 60s,

724
00:32:22.726 --> 00:32:24.506
that, that was karmically ordained,

725
00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:25.406
in terms of

726
00:32:25.406 --> 00:32:26.666
our soul purpose.
<v Regina>And that was the</v>

727
00:32:26.666 --> 00:32:28.106
Pluto, Pluto generation?

728
00:32:28.106 --> 00:32:29.306
<v ->Pluto and Leo</v>

729
00:32:29.306 --> 00:32:30.986
generation.
<v Regina>Yes, Pluto and Leo</v>

730
00:32:30.986 --> 00:32:32.186
generation.
<v Jessica>But the</v>

731
00:32:32.186 --> 00:32:33.646
little babies who were born,

732
00:32:33.646 --> 00:32:35.786
I'm looking at the Uranus and Pluto

733
00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:37.686
together in the chart when I say this,

734
00:32:37.686 --> 00:32:41.946
under those skies, they are in their prime now.

735
00:32:43.006 --> 00:32:45.396
When Uranus and Pluto have moved into

736
00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:46.486
this other relationship.

737
00:32:46.486 --> 00:32:50.216
So trying to say something, whether complex,

738
00:32:50.216 --> 00:32:51.801
in a simple way,

739
00:32:52.916 --> 00:32:55.526
we would say that, to take responsibility

740
00:32:55.526 --> 00:32:59.746
for the fact that there are certain skill sets

741
00:32:59.746 --> 00:33:01.686
in each chart.

742
00:33:01.686 --> 00:33:04.346
You know, and you don't have to be an astrologer

743
00:33:04.346 --> 00:33:07.406
to look at these, the crisis of these times

744
00:33:07.406 --> 00:33:09.126
and what do I do about 'em this way?

745
00:33:09.126 --> 00:33:12.156
You can do it through self-actualization methods.

746
00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:13.446
As long as your arm.

747
00:33:13.446 --> 00:33:15.676
Every wisdom path there is

748
00:33:15.676 --> 00:33:17.086
will lead you to the same place.

749
00:33:17.086 --> 00:33:20.706
Which is, who am I at my essence?

750
00:33:20.706 --> 00:33:23.756
And what is there about being born right now,

751
00:33:23.756 --> 00:33:25.646
when this is happening?

752
00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:29.926
So I do look at certain charts in these years,

753
00:33:29.926 --> 00:33:31.340
and see wow.

754
00:33:32.506 --> 00:33:36.126
That they seem to be singled out in a way

755
00:33:36.126 --> 00:33:40.376
so that their own individual growth arc,

756
00:33:40.376 --> 00:33:43.126
in a spiritual sense, matches,

757
00:33:43.126 --> 00:33:46.776
you know, lines up very closely

758
00:33:46.776 --> 00:33:51.236
with the collective evolutionary trajectory.

759
00:33:51.236 --> 00:33:53.106
And those are the people,

760
00:33:53.106 --> 00:33:55.296
who we would probably expect some

761
00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:58.496
explicit kind of leadership with,

762
00:33:58.496 --> 00:34:03.186
even in a anti-leadership movement, like OWS.

763
00:34:03.186 --> 00:34:06.641
But the rest, it's not for everybody to

764
00:34:07.596 --> 00:34:10.206
go out and, you know, camp in a city park.

765
00:34:11.576 --> 00:34:15.786
And the, the knowing the self,

766
00:34:15.786 --> 00:34:19.295
the self awareness, if you follow this line of logic,

767
00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:23.562
will show you what the times want of you.

768
00:34:24.872 --> 00:34:27.442
And if you're not in that place of looking inside

769
00:34:27.442 --> 00:34:30.742
to know what your spiritual skill set is

770
00:34:30.742 --> 00:34:33.162
and your practical skill set is,

771
00:34:33.162 --> 00:34:35.852
and your natural proclivities are,

772
00:34:35.852 --> 00:34:37.062
if you're not there, you're not gonna be

773
00:34:37.062 --> 00:34:39.342
any good to anybody, in any epic, anyway.

774
00:34:39.342 --> 00:34:41.541
<v Regina>Mmmhmm, very true.</v>

775
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:43.061
<v ->So I would say to your viewers,</v>

776
00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:45.821
if you have your chart and you want to take this

777
00:34:45.821 --> 00:34:49.161
one step further, there are some pivotal degrees

778
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:50.881
to look at.

779
00:34:50.881 --> 00:34:53.974
One of them is the 15th degree of mutable signs.

780
00:34:54.941 --> 00:34:57.201
If you have Gemini in your chart,

781
00:34:57.201 --> 00:34:59.932
it might be hit by this occultation

782
00:34:59.932 --> 00:35:02.621
of Venus, for example.

783
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:05.521
So I won't get too technical, but there are ways

784
00:35:05.521 --> 00:35:09.101
to try to interpret by having your chart done,

785
00:35:09.101 --> 00:35:10.221
to see--
<v Regina>Have somebody</v>

786
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:13.460
confident as Cher you have these specific

787
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.268
feelings.
<v Jessica>You'll be</v>

788
00:35:14.268 --> 00:35:16.028
feeling it anyway if you're in touch.

789
00:35:16.028 --> 00:35:17.448
<v Regina>At least you can put</v>

790
00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:20.248
your mind over it for a deeper understanding,

791
00:35:20.248 --> 00:35:21.228
rather than just
<v Jessica>A deeper</v>

792
00:35:21.228 --> 00:35:22.388
understanding.
<v Regina>understanding.</v>

793
00:35:22.388 --> 00:35:23.408
<v ->Rather than reacting.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

794
00:35:23.408 --> 00:35:24.908
<v ->And that's what I've been wanting</v>

795
00:35:24.908 --> 00:35:27.132
to say since you asked that question about Mars.

796
00:35:28.778 --> 00:35:32.006
Mutable signs, in general, are going to be very

797
00:35:32.006 --> 00:35:35.436
restless and pesky.

798
00:35:36.496 --> 00:35:37.366
Needling.

799
00:35:37.366 --> 00:35:39.566
You like, Virgo does it worst.

800
00:35:39.566 --> 00:35:40.726
And if nagging--

801
00:35:40.726 --> 00:35:42.066
<v Regina>Name the mutable signs for everyone.</v>

802
00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:44.586
<v ->Okay, Virgo, Gemini, Pisces,</v>

803
00:35:44.586 --> 00:35:47.472
where Chiron and Neptune are gonna be.

804
00:35:50.226 --> 00:35:52.026
Sagittarius.

805
00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:55.011
Now these are gonna be hit by Mars

806
00:35:56.066 --> 00:36:00.086
in a natal chart, in the USA chart.

807
00:36:00.086 --> 00:36:02.886
In fact, in January.

808
00:36:02.886 --> 00:36:04.366
January 23rd, Mars is gonna

809
00:36:04.366 --> 00:36:06.486
make a station at 23 Virgo.

810
00:36:06.486 --> 00:36:09.676
It's gonna then come back later in the year,

811
00:36:09.676 --> 00:36:11.206
and that's going to be right on top

812
00:36:11.206 --> 00:36:12.908
of the USA Neptune.

813
00:36:14.036 --> 00:36:15.826
And so this is kind, the kind of things

814
00:36:15.826 --> 00:36:18.396
astrologers look at when we talk about,

815
00:36:18.396 --> 00:36:21.966
for example, the smoke screens.

816
00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:24.256
Neptune can be delusion,

817
00:36:24.256 --> 00:36:27.426
as well as being lost in a beautiful, spiritual way.

818
00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:30.306
It can mean being fogged in.

819
00:36:30.306 --> 00:36:33.186
Like the Indian was in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,

820
00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:34.606
when he took a drug and he imagined they

821
00:36:34.606 --> 00:36:36.556
were fogging him in.

822
00:36:36.556 --> 00:36:37.526
That's Neptune.

823
00:36:37.526 --> 00:36:40.146
So the whole country has that going on.

824
00:36:40.146 --> 00:36:42.066
And when we see, for example,

825
00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.126
Mars is gonna station on it,

826
00:36:44.126 --> 00:36:46.426
it's like Mercury stationing on election day.

827
00:36:46.426 --> 00:36:48.366
A lot of astrologers start to make

828
00:36:48.366 --> 00:36:50.376
predictions about that.

829
00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:51.543
And what we can do,

830
00:36:53.176 --> 00:36:54.986
to be on the right side of it,

831
00:36:56.936 --> 00:36:58.865
is try to get back to the higher meaning

832
00:36:58.865 --> 00:37:00.705
of these energies.

833
00:37:00.705 --> 00:37:03.445
And not succumb really to that

834
00:37:03.445 --> 00:37:06.745
default position you were talking about.

835
00:37:07.775 --> 00:37:10.685
The higher meaning of that Neptune for the USA,

836
00:37:10.685 --> 00:37:12.175
for example,

837
00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:17.355
is a dreamy yearning for,

838
00:37:17.355 --> 00:37:21.395
to be able to pour yourself into something meaningful.

839
00:37:21.395 --> 00:37:25.215
It's Neptune in the ninth house of spiritual search.

840
00:37:25.215 --> 00:37:28.405
And it's been all covered over and buried

841
00:37:28.405 --> 00:37:30.965
and distracted by other parts of the chart,

842
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:33.015
which seem to put this

843
00:37:33.015 --> 00:37:36.181
laser-like obsessive energy on money and material.

844
00:37:37.275 --> 00:37:40.525
Pluto's in the second house of the USA chart.

845
00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:43.205
Which, by the way, is going to peak in 2022.

846
00:37:43.205 --> 00:37:46.741
We're gonna have a Pluto return, as a nation.

847
00:37:48.305 --> 00:37:51.585
But, you know, the higher vibration of

848
00:37:51.585 --> 00:37:53.425
each of these planets is why I think

849
00:37:53.425 --> 00:37:55.685
in the biggest picture, they're happening.

850
00:37:55.685 --> 00:37:58.185
So why are these transits happening?

851
00:37:58.185 --> 00:38:00.375
The planets don't really give a pin

852
00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:03.475
about the USA getting out of debt.

853
00:38:03.475 --> 00:38:05.641
Or, you know, whether China's gonna be top dog.

854
00:38:08.125 --> 00:38:11.205
Uranus, for example, is the spirit behind

855
00:38:12.345 --> 00:38:13.745
democracy.

856
00:38:13.745 --> 00:38:16.865
You know, the planet was sighted,

857
00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:18.375
first sighted in the sky around

858
00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:19.705
the American Revolution,

859
00:38:19.705 --> 00:38:22.605
and so there's this correspondence there.

860
00:38:22.605 --> 00:38:25.465
And the idea that Uranus in everybody's

861
00:38:25.465 --> 00:38:30.395
individual chart is that person's impulse

862
00:38:30.395 --> 00:38:32.751
towards individuation.

863
00:38:34.065 --> 00:38:36.605
This radical idea, and you see,

864
00:38:36.605 --> 00:38:38.185
it didn't happen until the 18th century

865
00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:40.365
because the world mind wasn't ready for it.

866
00:38:40.365 --> 00:38:43.435
That's why it wasn't discovered until then.

867
00:38:43.435 --> 00:38:47.375
So, you realize that, it's a modern sensibility,

868
00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:50.551
relative to human, you know, 200,000 years

869
00:38:51.545 --> 00:38:55.185
on the planet, that represents the potential

870
00:38:55.185 --> 00:38:58.945
every person has, and every country has.

871
00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:02.425
To believe that each individual has a voice.

872
00:39:02.425 --> 00:39:05.285
And that's coming up against Pluto.

873
00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:07.755
And they're equally weighted.

874
00:39:07.755 --> 00:39:11.545
So when the fur flies, who you gonna put your,

875
00:39:11.545 --> 00:39:13.125
your heart behind and that's what

876
00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:15.735
I'm saying in terms of, to know.

877
00:39:15.735 --> 00:39:19.675
Uranus can also be crazy, chaotic,

878
00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:23.425
running around, and technology run a muck.

879
00:39:23.425 --> 00:39:26.685
A society governed by technology,

880
00:39:26.685 --> 00:39:28.485
rather than the other way around.

881
00:39:28.485 --> 00:39:30.605
<v Regina>Well, I think we see the evidence</v>

882
00:39:30.605 --> 00:39:32.265
for that everywhere.

883
00:39:32.265 --> 00:39:34.145
<v ->There's evidence everywhere, but it's about</v>

884
00:39:34.145 --> 00:39:36.345
which one we want to create.

885
00:39:36.345 --> 00:39:37.485
<v Regina>And speaking of that,</v>

886
00:39:37.485 --> 00:39:39.865
when you're talking about technology running

887
00:39:39.865 --> 00:39:41.965
the country instead of the other way around,

888
00:39:41.965 --> 00:39:44.065
that brings me to something I'm very intrigued with,

889
00:39:44.065 --> 00:39:46.965
which is the younger generation of the 20-somethings.

890
00:39:46.965 --> 00:39:48.005
<v ->Yeah.</v>

891
00:39:48.005 --> 00:39:51.625
<v Regina>Now, are they the Libra generation?</v>

892
00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:52.965
The 20-somethings?

893
00:39:52.965 --> 00:39:54.885
<v ->I don't, well, you mean Pluto being in a</v>

894
00:39:54.885 --> 00:39:55.905
certain sign?
<v Regina>Yeah,</v>

895
00:39:55.905 --> 00:39:57.305
was Pluto in a--

896
00:39:57.305 --> 00:39:58.665
<v ->I'm not sure, I'd have to look it up.</v>

897
00:39:58.665 --> 00:40:00.085
<v Regina>Yeah, whatever they are,</v>

898
00:40:00.085 --> 00:40:04.405
the thing that seems to be expressed through them is

899
00:40:04.405 --> 00:40:07.715
connection and transparency.

900
00:40:07.715 --> 00:40:09.765
It's almost as though, yes, we look at all

901
00:40:09.765 --> 00:40:11.665
the material aspects of life.

902
00:40:11.665 --> 00:40:14.195
Everybody has to have their new, you know,

903
00:40:14.195 --> 00:40:16.155
iPhone and whatever.

904
00:40:16.155 --> 00:40:20.535
But it really seems they're about connection.

905
00:40:20.535 --> 00:40:22.475
<v ->That's very interesting.
<v Regina>Yes,</v>

906
00:40:22.475 --> 00:40:25.165
and they're, transparency is endemic to it.

907
00:40:25.165 --> 00:40:27.405
They don't, I was talking with some 20-somethings

908
00:40:27.405 --> 00:40:29.685
the other day and they're, you got the whole range

909
00:40:29.685 --> 00:40:31.445
of the typical arguments, which is,

910
00:40:31.445 --> 00:40:33.485
well, so what if some of our rights are

911
00:40:33.485 --> 00:40:36.355
taken away if you don't have anything to hide?

912
00:40:36.355 --> 00:40:38.615
But from their point of view,

913
00:40:38.615 --> 00:40:41.045
that's not just naivety speaking,

914
00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:42.525
they're so transparent,

915
00:40:42.525 --> 00:40:44.375
<v ->That's very interesting.
<v Regina>already</v>

916
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.325
in what they do and the way they

917
00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:48.665
choose to see each other and be seen.

918
00:40:48.665 --> 00:40:50.205
Whether it's through, you know,

919
00:40:50.205 --> 00:40:52.425
Facebook or whatnot--

920
00:40:52.425 --> 00:40:54.385
<v ->Completely different than our generation.</v>

921
00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:55.705
<v Regina>Completely different.</v>

922
00:40:55.705 --> 00:40:57.624
<v ->And for interological
<v Regina>And so what happens</v>

923
00:40:57.624 --> 00:40:58.967
yeah.
<v Jessica>wiring.</v>

924
00:40:58.967 --> 00:41:00.608
So what happens when you have

925
00:41:00.608 --> 00:41:02.028
a young generation that's coming into

926
00:41:02.028 --> 00:41:04.247
some really prime energy, and some of them

927
00:41:04.247 --> 00:41:08.048
are directing it toward the Occupy movement.

928
00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:12.856
But what is the beauty and hope in that generation,

929
00:41:12.856 --> 00:41:17.396
in these times, where connection and transparency rules?

930
00:41:18.516 --> 00:41:21.107
<v ->I think that's very well said, and I think that we</v>

931
00:41:21.107 --> 00:41:25.746
go back to this idea, which is fundamental

932
00:41:25.746 --> 00:41:28.746
in this type of astrology, which is that those

933
00:41:28.746 --> 00:41:31.147
outer planet placements that they have in

934
00:41:31.147 --> 00:41:33.807
their charts, set them up for a certain

935
00:41:33.807 --> 00:41:36.946
set of emphases, for a certain set of

936
00:41:36.946 --> 00:41:39.107
understandings that they have that our

937
00:41:39.107 --> 00:41:41.226
generation didn't have.

938
00:41:41.226 --> 00:41:45.467
Not just skills, but something that we

939
00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:47.126
almost don't have English words for,

940
00:41:47.126 --> 00:41:51.346
which is a certain evolutionary blueprint,

941
00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:56.347
that is in them, that is mandated by

942
00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.946
when they were born, so that when they got

943
00:41:58.946 --> 00:42:00.907
to a certain age, say the Saturn return,

944
00:42:00.907 --> 00:42:04.067
when they're 30, and coming into their prime

945
00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:06.987
responsible consciousness, that the world would be

946
00:42:06.987 --> 00:42:09.007
at a certain place, and their particular skills

947
00:42:09.007 --> 00:42:12.299
and interests, like you say, the Sanford and Son

948
00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:15.550
transparency, would naturally be brought to bear

949
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.960
on what the collective needs to happen,

950
00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.339
at that time.

951
00:42:21.339 --> 00:42:24.360
Which it had other problems when we were young.

952
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.059
We didn't know from ecology ,

953
00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:27.260
we didn't even have the word for it.

954
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.832
We were just into don't litter.

955
00:42:28.832 --> 00:42:30.372
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

956
00:42:30.372 --> 00:42:32.902
<v ->So then you had a generation,</v>

957
00:42:32.902 --> 00:42:36.982
that sort of began the environmentalist movement

958
00:42:36.982 --> 00:42:39.851
and they had all this Virgo in their chart,

959
00:42:39.851 --> 00:42:41.691
which is cleaning up, and so it became

960
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:43.972
cleaning up the earth on mass.

961
00:42:43.972 --> 00:42:47.471
And then these ones who are even younger,

962
00:42:47.471 --> 00:42:50.671
who I think are going to create a backlash

963
00:42:50.671 --> 00:42:52.772
to the backlash.

964
00:42:52.772 --> 00:42:56.152
I think they have the ingredients in their charts,

965
00:42:56.152 --> 00:42:58.341
to en masse--
<v Regina>What's that mean?</v>

966
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:01.182
<v ->The transparency is a backlash</v>

967
00:43:01.182 --> 00:43:05.271
to the corporatocracy and the kleptocracy.

968
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:08.072
And that's why they watch Jon Stewart

969
00:43:08.072 --> 00:43:09.982
to get their news.

970
00:43:09.982 --> 00:43:11.732
Because you can only laugh at it.

971
00:43:11.732 --> 00:43:13.822
<v Regina>Right, that is very true.</v>

972
00:43:13.822 --> 00:43:16.641
Hey, it's as viable as any other new source.

973
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:17.531
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Regina>Probably</v>

974
00:43:17.531 --> 00:43:18.872
more so in a lot of ways.

975
00:43:18.872 --> 00:43:20.832
<v ->And I do think that, you know, they</v>

976
00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:23.471
have just not bought in at all.

977
00:43:23.471 --> 00:43:25.879
<v Regina>No, they do not seem to have bought in.</v>

978
00:43:25.879 --> 00:43:27.499
They're more concerned with the creation

979
00:43:27.499 --> 00:43:29.201
of their own realities.

980
00:43:30.609 --> 00:43:32.329
<v ->So I think that's genetically wired,</v>

981
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:34.059
hard-wired.

982
00:43:34.059 --> 00:43:35.249
And that the planets revealed,

983
00:43:35.249 --> 00:43:37.369
the outer planets reveal that these are

984
00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:40.359
the ones that govern whole generations.

985
00:43:40.359 --> 00:43:41.859
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

986
00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:46.859
So, in looking at all of these factors in review,

987
00:43:48.229 --> 00:43:52.059
what do you see as the most beautiful potential

988
00:43:53.199 --> 00:43:55.959
that can be expressed in these times?

989
00:43:55.959 --> 00:43:59.429
And we understand that this is a path

990
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:02.179
of consciousness for every person participating,

991
00:44:02.179 --> 00:44:04.909
but in an ideal world, where we do wake up

992
00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:06.389
to the possibilities at hand.

993
00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:08.469
What do you see as the most beautiful

994
00:44:08.469 --> 00:44:10.126
potential outcome?

995
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:14.748
<v ->It has to do with breaking through illusion</v>

996
00:44:14.748 --> 00:44:16.988
that has to be done.

997
00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:19.788
I call it step one, unplug your TV.

998
00:44:22.078 --> 00:44:23.748
Going inside and getting in touch,

999
00:44:23.748 --> 00:44:25.448
as we were saying before,

1000
00:44:26.778 --> 00:44:28.668
with what you have that nobody else has.

1001
00:44:28.668 --> 00:44:30.558
What you know

1002
00:44:30.558 --> 00:44:33.038
that nobody else knows.

1003
00:44:33.038 --> 00:44:35.058
That's inner work.

1004
00:44:35.058 --> 00:44:37.788
And I think that none of the beautiful potentials

1005
00:44:37.788 --> 00:44:39.908
that we would like to see can happen without it.

1006
00:44:41.588 --> 00:44:44.018
This, by the way, just a little side note,

1007
00:44:44.018 --> 00:44:45.428
I'm thinking our generation wasn't

1008
00:44:45.428 --> 00:44:47.668
particularly good at that.

1009
00:44:47.668 --> 00:44:51.793
At least the activists, that's DS marches.

1010
00:44:51.793 --> 00:44:55.323
We thought that was naval basing and we didn't.

1011
00:44:55.323 --> 00:44:57.424
We were the other way, but these things swing,

1012
00:44:57.424 --> 00:44:59.063
like a pendulum.

1013
00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:02.573
So I think that the beautiful potential of

1014
00:45:03.673 --> 00:45:05.585
unprecedented crisis,

1015
00:45:07.213 --> 00:45:10.083
is that one is forced to wake up.

1016
00:45:11.423 --> 00:45:15.583
There can't be anymore superficial reforms

1017
00:45:15.583 --> 00:45:17.463
of the banking system,

1018
00:45:17.463 --> 00:45:20.063
if it's being done at the same level.

1019
00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:23.742
I mean, if it's being dictated by the lobbyists,

1020
00:45:23.742 --> 00:45:26.645
you're not going to get laws regulating lobbying.

1021
00:45:28.163 --> 00:45:30.682
So it's this old Einstein idea that you can't

1022
00:45:30.682 --> 00:45:33.242
change a system from within the system.

1023
00:45:34.912 --> 00:45:39.117
And I think that it's getting, so that we have to

1024
00:45:39.117 --> 00:45:41.526
have people outside of the system.

1025
00:45:41.526 --> 00:45:43.907
That, a huge radical break.

1026
00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.517
Once they've unplugged from the delusions

1027
00:45:46.517 --> 00:45:49.411
which are being spun out from the fog machine,

1028
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:51.431
gotten in touch with who they are.

1029
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:56.491
And I'm afraid that calamity is very good

1030
00:45:56.491 --> 00:45:59.350
at getting us in touch.

1031
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:02.141
<v Regina>People respond to pain and pressure.</v>

1032
00:46:02.141 --> 00:46:04.351
<v ->People will change overnight,</v>

1033
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:06.570
the world could change overnight.

1034
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.631
<v Regina>And this water, this water thing</v>

1035
00:46:08.631 --> 00:46:09.951
you mentioned earlier--

1036
00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:12.671
<v ->Neptune is going into Pisces to stay.</v>

1037
00:46:12.671 --> 00:46:14.471
<v Regina>Does that mean literal we could</v>

1038
00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.090
have some inundations or some--

1039
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.351
<v ->Well we have had</v>

1040
00:46:17.351 --> 00:46:18.611
when it was--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1041
00:46:18.611 --> 00:46:20.511
<v ->When it dipped it's toe into Pisces,</v>

1042
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.741
which governs the oceans.

1043
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:24.831
Last year, and then it went retrograde out.

1044
00:46:24.831 --> 00:46:27.951
But during the time it was in, we had floods.

1045
00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:31.371
And sea levels are rising anyway.

1046
00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:32.771
We can, we've mapped them out.

1047
00:46:32.771 --> 00:46:33.831
This is another kind of thing,

1048
00:46:33.831 --> 00:46:35.471
which isn't on the news.

1049
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:38.801
They'd rather talk about little political squabbling.

1050
00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:41.430
But these are immensely important developments,

1051
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:45.771
which, they come from the symbolism

1052
00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:50.041
of water on every level.

1053
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:52.001
The literal level,

1054
00:46:52.001 --> 00:46:54.730
is that water disasters, tsunamis,

1055
00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.051
which we can hardly call freak anymore.

1056
00:46:57.051 --> 00:47:01.511
Their freak weather patterns are now becoming the norm.

1057
00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:05.755
Drinking water, clean water.

1058
00:47:05.755 --> 00:47:07.945
You know, right now, a lot of people in cities

1059
00:47:07.945 --> 00:47:10.795
are drinking sewage affluent,

1060
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:12.595
that's been semi purified.

1061
00:47:12.595 --> 00:47:14.334
I know it's very crude to say that,

1062
00:47:14.334 --> 00:47:17.585
but this is really what's happening.

1063
00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:20.254
And we can't imagine that beings,

1064
00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:22.675
like humans that are 95% water,

1065
00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:25.995
are not gonna respond physiologically,

1066
00:47:25.995 --> 00:47:29.645
to taking in water that is that polluted.

1067
00:47:29.645 --> 00:47:32.905
So I think that the big deal is gonna be

1068
00:47:32.905 --> 00:47:35.114
water in many different ways.

1069
00:47:35.114 --> 00:47:37.155
And people who see this coming

1070
00:47:37.155 --> 00:47:40.765
are thinking in terms of, go back to the idea of value,

1071
00:47:40.765 --> 00:47:42.336
what really has value.

1072
00:47:43.675 --> 00:47:45.295
Clean water.

1073
00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.995
And food for the seven billion people

1074
00:47:49.355 --> 00:47:51.915
is going to come, this next calendar year,

1075
00:47:51.915 --> 00:47:55.354
to be seen as far more valuable than

1076
00:47:55.354 --> 00:47:59.365
gold, dollars, pound sterling.

1077
00:47:59.365 --> 00:48:01.875
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Stock quotes.</v>

1078
00:48:01.875 --> 00:48:04.425
Arable land, too.

1079
00:48:04.425 --> 00:48:07.734
This is really breaking it down to essentials.

1080
00:48:07.734 --> 00:48:11.574
So I see, it's with great happiness,

1081
00:48:11.574 --> 00:48:12.875
that I watch some of these people

1082
00:48:12.875 --> 00:48:15.055
in the generation you're talking about,

1083
00:48:15.055 --> 00:48:16.355
going back to the land--

1084
00:48:16.355 --> 00:48:18.015
<v Regina>Oh, it's wonderful.</v>

1085
00:48:18.015 --> 00:48:19.814
<v ->In a much more sophisticated way</v>

1086
00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:22.355
than we old hippies did.
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

1087
00:48:22.355 --> 00:48:23.674
<v ->The know their sense.
<v Regina>They have</v>

1088
00:48:23.674 --> 00:48:25.274
technology, they know the science,

1089
00:48:25.274 --> 00:48:27.955
they've got their cool little earrings on,

1090
00:48:27.955 --> 00:48:30.355
and cool little boots on, and they're out there

1091
00:48:30.355 --> 00:48:33.116
with their fingers in the dirt doing, you know,

1092
00:48:34.585 --> 00:48:36.715
bio-dynamic gardening, for example.

1093
00:48:36.715 --> 00:48:37.715
<v ->They're taking it
<v Regina>That's becoming</v>

1094
00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:38.795
common.
<v Jessica>in school.</v>

1095
00:48:38.795 --> 00:48:40.015
<v Regina>It's wonderful.</v>

1096
00:48:40.015 --> 00:48:41.174
<v ->They know what they're doing.</v>

1097
00:48:41.174 --> 00:48:42.995
And so this is another way we look at the

1098
00:48:42.995 --> 00:48:46.384
generational mandate, coming into it's own,

1099
00:48:46.384 --> 00:48:49.635
to answer to the crisis of the times.

1100
00:48:49.635 --> 00:48:52.436
There's nothing coming up that we can't deal with.

1101
00:48:55.225 --> 00:48:57.254
And if you just consider that,

1102
00:48:59.194 --> 00:49:01.074
that freeze, we are the 99%,

1103
00:49:01.074 --> 00:49:04.414
that's an awful lot more people than 1%.

1104
00:49:04.414 --> 00:49:06.114
<v Regina>Yes, it is.</v>
<v ->There are</v>

1105
00:49:06.114 --> 00:49:07.694
an awful lot of us.

1106
00:49:07.694 --> 00:49:09.794
<v ->On that note, any final thoughts,</v>

1107
00:49:09.794 --> 00:49:11.934
that's a, kind of was a final thought,

1108
00:49:11.934 --> 00:49:12.974
and it was beautiful.

1109
00:49:12.974 --> 00:49:16.036
Any final comments you want to make about 2012?

1110
00:49:19.614 --> 00:49:22.124
<v ->On the Venus occultation--</v>

1111
00:49:22.124 --> 00:49:23.094
<v Regina>And that was at</v>

1112
00:49:23.094 --> 00:49:24.274
June 24th?
<v Jessica>At June 5th,</v>

1113
00:49:24.274 --> 00:49:26.534
June 5th.
<v Regina>June 5th, okay.</v>

1114
00:49:26.534 --> 00:49:27.514
Alright.

1115
00:49:27.514 --> 00:49:29.494
<v ->The Uranus-Pluto square is June 24th.</v>

1116
00:49:29.494 --> 00:49:33.094
All of June, right around the time of the summer solstice,

1117
00:49:33.094 --> 00:49:34.654
will be very magical.

1118
00:49:34.654 --> 00:49:36.194
How wonderful it would be,

1119
00:49:37.704 --> 00:49:40.534
if everyone go into their hearts,

1120
00:49:40.534 --> 00:49:45.012
which is the highest meaning of the planet Venus,

1121
00:49:46.894 --> 00:49:51.204
and started to let, let that as a meditation,

1122
00:49:51.204 --> 00:49:54.644
on a body level, on a spiritual level,

1123
00:49:54.644 --> 00:49:57.394
suggest to them the way that they could

1124
00:49:57.394 --> 00:50:00.790
take responsibility for being alive now.

1125
00:50:02.024 --> 00:50:04.384
To ground ourselves in our heart.

1126
00:50:04.384 --> 00:50:06.874
And June is a perfect opportunity.

1127
00:50:06.874 --> 00:50:10.470
The planets are all lined up to allow us to do that.

1128
00:50:12.244 --> 00:50:15.170
<v Regina>Well, you'll have to have a little celebration.</v>

1129
00:50:16.734 --> 00:50:17.874
<v ->Definitely.</v>

1130
00:50:17.874 --> 00:50:20.274
<v Regina>On that note, thank you so much.</v>

1131
00:50:20.274 --> 00:50:22.210
As always, so eloquently put,

1132
00:50:23.704 --> 00:50:26.254
and I like the fact that you're not the

1133
00:50:26.254 --> 00:50:29.494
purveyor of hard predictions.

1134
00:50:29.494 --> 00:50:33.234
Because first of all, that only leads to embarrassment

1135
00:50:33.234 --> 00:50:35.934
in a lot of cases because we can't predict how

1136
00:50:35.934 --> 00:50:37.574
our consciousness and mass is going to

1137
00:50:37.574 --> 00:50:39.094
respond to all of these.

1138
00:50:39.094 --> 00:50:41.894
<v ->No, it's not just that we don't want to,</v>

1139
00:50:41.894 --> 00:50:43.824
it's really not possible.
<v Regina>It's not possible.</v>

1140
00:50:43.824 --> 00:50:45.954
So I love the way you present the information,

1141
00:50:45.954 --> 00:50:48.454
and thank you, just a few days before

1142
00:50:48.454 --> 00:50:50.994
the New Year for taking time to do this once again.

1143
00:50:52.014 --> 00:50:53.147
<v ->It's a pleasure.</v>

1144
00:50:54.874 --> 00:50:56.254
<v ->While many people view these times</v>

1145
00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:57.914
as a challenge and do not want to hear

1146
00:50:57.914 --> 00:50:59.714
what they feel is depressing news,

1147
00:50:59.714 --> 00:51:01.894
I view it as a golden invitation for

1148
00:51:01.894 --> 00:51:04.834
each of us to step into our authentic selves

1149
00:51:04.834 --> 00:51:06.634
and discern what we have to offer.

1150
00:51:06.634 --> 00:51:08.894
It will take a village and more to give birth

1151
00:51:08.894 --> 00:51:11.714
to a new paradigm of conscious living.

1152
00:51:11.714 --> 00:51:13.974
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1153
00:51:13.974 --> 00:51:15.704
(tranquil music)
