00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.562
<v ->Emmett Miller grew up as an outsider</v>

2
00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:04.514
in the harsh environment of New York.

3
00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:06.391
He was black, a Shakespeare fan,

4
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:08.876
mathematics geek, and visionary.

5
00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.927
He didn't fit with the world of the black nor the whites.

6
00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:13.900
He witnessed firsthand how separatism

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.215
was the prevailing political paradigm.

8
00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.932
Later in life as a medical student,

9
00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:20.470
he noticed that this same paradigm of separatism

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.574
was being taught in relationship to patient care.

11
00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:25.835
This sent him on a lifelong quest

12
00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.459
to heal both patients and the planet.

13
00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.667
Emmett brings a loving heart and brilliant mind

14
00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.555
to the table of the paradigm shift,

15
00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:37.146
which he says cannot occur without deep self-examination.

16
00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.647
<v Regina>I love what you've done here,</v>

17
00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.069
but it's going to be quite a task

18
00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.383
for us to get through this in 45 minutes,

19
00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:54.431
because you want to heal the world.

20
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:56.937
That's valiant and we need to heal the world,

21
00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:00.447
and we need people like you to do this, to guide us,

22
00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:02.622
but we're going to jump into --

23
00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:04.436
I want to get just a teeny bit of background

24
00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.739
on your motivation from medical school days,

25
00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.363
and seeing the huge disconnect in the way

26
00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:12.488
the system taught you to, quote, "heal people,"

27
00:01:12.488 --> 00:01:16.072
and society at large, and the globe.

28
00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:17.853
What was your initial experience

29
00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:21.122
that sent you down this road?

30
00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:24.660
<v ->Well, I think that soon after I arrived</v>

31
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.535
in medical school and started working with patients,

32
00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:34.484
my clinical years, I was astounded to see

33
00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:38.963
what, basically, was a very abusive pattern

34
00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:42.728
between the medical system and the patient.

35
00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.331
Many physicians who were very fine men

36
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.435
and who I continued to look up to and emulate,

37
00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:51.827
even to this day, who loved their patients,

38
00:01:51.827 --> 00:01:55.400
who felt for their patients, and who gave their patients

39
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.791
more than just some drugs and surgery,

40
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:03.303
but the system as a whole tended to select human beings

41
00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:07.762
to come into it that would participate in providing

42
00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:09.265
a decidedly un --

43
00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:19.547
an entirely inappropriate form of medicine,

44
00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:21.993
a real sub-standard form of medicine.

45
00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:23.795
<v Regina>Well, and they teach this in school even.</v>

46
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:28.795
I was reading part of this culture on a couch concept here,

47
00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.041
and you were talking about, even in the system,

48
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.388
when they teach you as an intern

49
00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.662
to not become emotionally involved with your patient.

50
00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:39.966
You can understand that in the extreme,

51
00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:42.536
but doesn't that toss out empathy?

52
00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:45.811
Doesn't it toss out a certain amount of compassion?

53
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.581
What happens when the system is actually

54
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.228
structured such a way?

55
00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:52.862
<v ->Well, what happens is we have a system which</v>

56
00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:56.819
is not aimed toward creating health, and wholeness,

57
00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.649
and healing, but is aimed at creating more business

58
00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:01.971
for the system.

59
00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:04.435
To not really provide people with what they need,

60
00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:07.123
and I'm not blaming any person.

61
00:03:07.123 --> 00:03:09.011
I'm simply talking about the system.

62
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.978
We're all caught in a very dysfunctional system

63
00:03:12.978 --> 00:03:16.061
which is destroying us, and that became clear to me

64
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.949
when I was in medical school.

65
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.061
<v Regina>As you were looking at these people</v>

66
00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:22.919
with varying degrees of illness, you were also seeing

67
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.071
the system that they had just

68
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.044
plugged into to heal them as ill,

69
00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.412
and the system that's running that as ill.

70
00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:31.432
As you extrapolated out, you have a planet

71
00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:36.432
that is diseased, that is becoming very crippled.

72
00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.400
<v ->Yes, well growing up as a black man</v>

73
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.418
in the '40s and the '50s, I experienced this

74
00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:45.618
incredible inequity of the system.

75
00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:50.618
At home, I lived in a neighborhood that was 98% black.

76
00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.959
When I was in school, because I was intelligent,

77
00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.671
I was surrounded by basically 100% white

78
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.849
and Jewish people in New York City.

79
00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.222
Wonderful people, people had no sense, however,

80
00:04:05.222 --> 00:04:08.582
of what was being done to those of another color

81
00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:12.027
three blocks away from the school.

82
00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:16.848
There was such prejudice at that time.

83
00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:19.408
I had an opportunity to feel that prejudice.

84
00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:23.653
I had the opportunity to feel it at home, too, because

85
00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:26.234
because I was intelligent, because I read Shakespeare,

86
00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:29.295
because I was interested in math and physics,

87
00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:31.620
I was considered to be weird.

88
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.748
At home, the black people considered me far too white

89
00:04:35.748 --> 00:04:37.679
to be fully included.

90
00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.719
White people considered me too black to be included,

91
00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.905
so I was never invited to any social functions

92
00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:46.158
or parties, all the usual things that happen

93
00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.547
in a racist society.

94
00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:52.377
I knew that this was part of the political system.

95
00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:54.670
Suddenly I found out that people were

96
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.200
operating under the same principles

97
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.293
in the medical system itself.

98
00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:03.565
People were not being attended to.

99
00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:05.304
They were being harmed.

100
00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:09.399
It became clear to me soon into my medical career

101
00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:12.621
that I could do more by touching a person,

102
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:15.543
by touching them physically.

103
00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:19.170
Indeed, how I performed the physical examination.

104
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.217
As I touched their body, I treated their body

105
00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:23.253
as though it was something precious,

106
00:05:23.253 --> 00:05:25.418
as though it was something beautiful.

107
00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:27.999
My goal was to discover, how could I lead

108
00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.340
this person to begin to make changes in their lives

109
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.305
that would bring out the dormant beauty

110
00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:38.974
within that body that was called sick?

111
00:05:38.974 --> 00:05:42.270
Instead of doing what American medicine did,

112
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.590
allopathic medicine, which was to try to fight the sickness,

113
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.432
I recognized that 90% of the illnesses that people had,

114
00:05:51.432 --> 00:05:54.056
the physical illnesses that brought them to me

115
00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.773
as a physician, had their root,

116
00:05:55.773 --> 00:06:00.328
not in some external cause, but in an internal cause.

117
00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:02.024
It was the result of how they were dealing

118
00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.901
with stress in their lives.

119
00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:05.661
It had to do with the images that they

120
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:07.527
were holding in their mind.

121
00:06:07.527 --> 00:06:09.330
Had to do with their self-image,

122
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.378
how they saw themselves, how much value

123
00:06:11.378 --> 00:06:14.183
they placed in themselves, the amount of contact

124
00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:18.801
they had with a spiritual life, those things.

125
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.478
The amount of contact they had with spiritual life,

126
00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:25.211
those are the things that ultimately would come out

127
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:28.166
as physical symptomatology.

128
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.920
I began to set my direction toward two things.

129
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.077
First, deriving a system by which we could

130
00:06:35.077 --> 00:06:37.339
work with people, that would enable them

131
00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.080
to use their minds to awaken the intrinsic

132
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.205
healing power that was obviously within people.

133
00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:45.137
I was able to demonstrate that over, and over,

134
00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:50.054
and over again in my clinical practice to my satisfaction.

135
00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:51.963
But, the question is, what can we do

136
00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:56.859
to maximize a person's ability to use the mind

137
00:06:56.859 --> 00:06:59.419
to awaken that healing power within,

138
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.872
and allow it to flow into those organs,

139
00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:03.941
and organ systems, and behaviors,

140
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:08.941
and beliefs, and emotions where healing is needed.

141
00:07:09.306 --> 00:07:12.346
When that takes place, then the physical symptom

142
00:07:12.346 --> 00:07:14.618
resolves on its own.

143
00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:16.197
Not everything resolves.

144
00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:17.989
There are certain things that can't,

145
00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:21.615
but like 90% of what it is that bothers us

146
00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:23.674
can be resolved in that way.

147
00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:25.604
That became my work.

148
00:07:25.604 --> 00:07:26.980
That was number one.

149
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.980
Number two was to change the medical system altogether.

150
00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:37.313
My belief is that in the changing how we look at healing,

151
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.003
we change how we look at humanity,

152
00:07:40.003 --> 00:07:41.816
how we look at human beings.

153
00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.408
This would be a high leverage point

154
00:07:44.408 --> 00:07:46.456
for changing the paradigm with which

155
00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:49.571
the world looked at itself,

156
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:53.464
with how people look at their relationships,

157
00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:55.352
their family, their community,

158
00:07:55.352 --> 00:07:58.061
people of other nations, or of other beliefs,

159
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.415
or of other races.

160
00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.311
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

161
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:02.658
I mean, healing extends out to all of those.

162
00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:03.724
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

163
00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:07.185
The basic -- (sighs)

164
00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:09.345
One of the things I was looking for is,

165
00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:14.345
what is the most fundamental formulation of that,

166
00:08:14.924 --> 00:08:19.915
the formula for healing, as it were, the correction program.

167
00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:22.582
As a mathematician, because I was a mathematician

168
00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:24.438
before I went into medicine,

169
00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:26.763
and my specialty was point set topology,

170
00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:31.029
how you transform one space into another space.

171
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:33.514
I simply used the principles of mathematics

172
00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:37.792
to look at illness as being a state.

173
00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:41.418
How can that state be transformed into another state

174
00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:44.577
that we can call health, or wellness --

175
00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:45.718
<v Regina>Or wholeness.</v>

176
00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:48.065
<v ->Or wholeness, or peak performance,</v>

177
00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:53.065
or joy, or love, or ecstasy.

178
00:08:53.888 --> 00:08:56.054
What would that be?

179
00:08:56.054 --> 00:09:00.085
That's what I worked on, is finding what is that,

180
00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:03.338
what is that fundamental healing formula?

181
00:09:03.338 --> 00:09:06.261
Realizing that when you find a fundamental formula

182
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:08.129
within a system like that,

183
00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:10.273
it works at all levels of systems.

184
00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:12.844
Precisely the same formula will work

185
00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.307
for the individual healing within themselves,

186
00:09:15.307 --> 00:09:16.769
bringing mind, body, emotions, spirit,

187
00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:19.606
and behavior into balance.

188
00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:21.952
It works in a family or a community.

189
00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:23.947
It works at that level, or it can work

190
00:09:23.947 --> 00:09:27.104
at the level of a nation, or at the level of a planet.

191
00:09:27.104 --> 00:09:29.867
Precisely the same process.

192
00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:33.856
By refining that in the privacy and the intimacy

193
00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:37.461
of the one-to-one contact with thousands upon thousands

194
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:41.962
of human beings, I was able to refine this

195
00:09:41.962 --> 00:09:44.543
to a certain degree.

196
00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:47.508
<v Regina>The world at large,</v>

197
00:09:47.508 --> 00:09:50.068
the world of medicine at large took

198
00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:52.667
a very different path than your path.

199
00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:53.765
<v ->Mm-hmm (affirmative).</v>

200
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:55.210
<v Regina>All you have to do is</v>

201
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.468
go into an HMO and this reason,

202
00:09:56.468 --> 00:09:58.953
say a Kaiser facility, and see the massive structures

203
00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:02.155
that are going up, the hallways crowded

204
00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:03.755
with people who are sick.

205
00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:08.755
It's amazing how ill we've become as a species, really.

206
00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:14.485
Yes, on one hand, you're looking at the quantum effect

207
00:10:14.485 --> 00:10:18.730
of healing the self, and you heal a portion or the whole.

208
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.079
But let's take it to a non-quantum third dimensional view.

209
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:26.206
How do we begin implementing this in the face of a system

210
00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:29.385
that has gone about its very narrow path

211
00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.635
that's every bit as deficient as it was

212
00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:35.795
when you were in medical school, if not worse now?

213
00:10:35.795 --> 00:10:40.094
<v ->Just as a human being brings healing to their lives,</v>

214
00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:43.155
whether it's physical, mental, emotional, relational,

215
00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:46.013
whatever it might be, behavioral,

216
00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:51.013
one brings healing into one's life by examining one's self,

217
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.397
by being willing to step back,

218
00:10:54.397 --> 00:10:57.277
to step back from the usual decisions,

219
00:10:57.277 --> 00:11:01.084
to stop playing the game, "I'm right, and I know everything,

220
00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:04.359
"and that person's wrong, and that person's wrong."

221
00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:09.359
This defensive stance, what we call on the individual basis,

222
00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:13.396
the ego defenses.

223
00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:17.417
Because a person has been injured in their lives,

224
00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:22.259
in order to protect something very, very sensitive within,

225
00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:25.822
they construct a set of beliefs about the world,

226
00:11:25.822 --> 00:11:29.235
a set of ways of interpreting the world.

227
00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:33.683
"You're Christian, so you must be evil."

228
00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:35.709
Ways of interpreting the world

229
00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:40.709
and ways of behaving in the world.

230
00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:46.601
In order to resolve some of the inner conflicts

231
00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:48.414
with an individual, the inner conflicts

232
00:11:48.414 --> 00:11:52.713
that are making them ill, it becomes necessary

233
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:56.307
to look at one's self and to look at this persona,

234
00:11:56.307 --> 00:11:59.027
to look at this ego that we've constructed,

235
00:11:59.027 --> 00:12:02.653
this PR agency that we've constructed

236
00:12:02.653 --> 00:12:06.066
to convince the rest of the world that we are

237
00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:09.522
whatever we're trying to convince them that we are,

238
00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:13.682
and to keep us convinced that we're okay.

239
00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:15.356
<v Regina>Right, that's the big one,</v>

240
00:12:15.356 --> 00:12:17.742
that self protection.

241
00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:20.649
This really requires an extreme amount

242
00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:24.179
of openness, vulnerability, and re-education.

243
00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:25.086
<v ->Yes.</v>

244
00:12:25.086 --> 00:12:26.430
<v Regina>I'm just going to pull one little fact</v>

245
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.222
from your manuscript that I've read,

246
00:12:28.222 --> 00:12:30.707
just because it kind of hits it square on, which is

247
00:12:30.707 --> 00:12:33.427
our way of dealing with things.

248
00:12:33.427 --> 00:12:36.509
"In California, between the years of 1980 and 1998,"

249
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:41.021
you say, "California built 21 prisons and one college

250
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.101
"in the same time period."

251
00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:44.615
What does that say about the way

252
00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:47.356
we're going about healing this thing?

253
00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:50.044
Education certainly is not the priority here, is it?

254
00:12:50.044 --> 00:12:51.026
<v ->No.</v>

255
00:12:51.026 --> 00:12:53.372
Well, we're not aiming to heal it.

256
00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:55.783
That's not what our behavior is.

257
00:12:55.783 --> 00:12:57.457
Maybe it's what we really want.

258
00:12:57.457 --> 00:13:00.220
I believe it's what we really want,

259
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.006
but in order to know that, we as a community

260
00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:06.833
of human beings as a collective,

261
00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:09.712
need to do that same process as the individual does

262
00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:13.541
to step back and take a look at ourselves,

263
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:17.403
to step out of the ego constraints to look at

264
00:13:17.403 --> 00:13:19.098
the defenses that we've set up,

265
00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:22.576
and say, "What's really true here?"

266
00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:25.221
Now, the system that we are under,

267
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:30.221
the system that builds far more prisons

268
00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:37.186
than hospitals, far more prisons than schools,

269
00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:41.124
this is a system that sees the world as

270
00:13:41.124 --> 00:13:45.443
a collection of opposing items.

271
00:13:45.443 --> 00:13:46.329
There's me and you.

272
00:13:46.329 --> 00:13:47.193
There's good and bad.

273
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.718
There's black and white.

274
00:13:48.718 --> 00:13:52.696
There's American and there's illegal alien.

275
00:13:52.696 --> 00:13:56.664
There's Christian and there's Muslim,

276
00:13:56.664 --> 00:13:58.872
and then there's infidel,

277
00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:02.466
and then there's the rich and the poor,

278
00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:05.762
and on, and on, and on, and on.

279
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.429
We see the world as being, essentially,

280
00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:12.407
consisting of different entities that are

281
00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:16.396
at war with each other, different products.

282
00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:20.300
Yahoo versus Google, I mean, aren't we

283
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.017
in the same business?

284
00:14:22.017 --> 00:14:23.756
No, but we see it as a --

285
00:14:23.756 --> 00:14:25.590
What if they got together?

286
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.142
What if they blended, what would happen?

287
00:14:29.142 --> 00:14:34.142
ABC, CBS, NBC all struggling, fighting.

288
00:14:34.464 --> 00:14:37.963
What if people got together, and instead of

289
00:14:37.963 --> 00:14:41.312
looking at differences, what if we looked at

290
00:14:41.312 --> 00:14:43.957
what is it that we have in common?

291
00:14:43.957 --> 00:14:46.954
Not to the exclusion of looking at differences,

292
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.693
differences are important.

293
00:14:48.693 --> 00:14:52.159
It's important for me to know that

294
00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.890
I'm a male and not a female, otherwise I'll get in trouble

295
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.895
in a public bathroom.

296
00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Regina>Right. (laughs)</v>

297
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.257
Yes, this is down the essence and very true.

298
00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:06.257
<v ->But our world looks far more at differences</v>

299
00:15:06.452 --> 00:15:08.404
than it does at similarities.

300
00:15:08.404 --> 00:15:10.910
We don't look at the union.

301
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.491
We look at, what are the things

302
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:15.699
that are creating violence?

303
00:15:15.699 --> 00:15:18.856
What are the things that are creating conflict?

304
00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:23.856
We look at contrasts, and then we take sides.

305
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.705
Then we become Republican, or we become Democrat,

306
00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:32.926
or we become whatever it might be.

307
00:15:32.926 --> 00:15:35.070
We take sides, and then we envision ourselves

308
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.809
as in this battle.

309
00:15:36.809 --> 00:15:40.969
Here are these young men and women

310
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:45.470
who've had absolutely terrible childhoods.

311
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.230
They've lived in poverty.

312
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.949
They've been abused by parents that the system

313
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:53.405
takes no time to train how to be parents.

314
00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:55.730
You need a license to drive a car.

315
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.442
You don't even need a license to be a parent,

316
00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:03.954
and many of them are suffering from inborn problems.

317
00:16:03.954 --> 00:16:07.250
Probably 30% to 40% of the people in prisons

318
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.247
have clinical attention deficit disorder.

319
00:16:10.247 --> 00:16:11.985
These are patients,

320
00:16:11.985 --> 00:16:15.654
but no, we see them as the bad guys,

321
00:16:15.654 --> 00:16:17.948
because one of the fastest growing industries

322
00:16:17.948 --> 00:16:21.414
in the country is the security industry,

323
00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:24.710
the building of prisons where we can warehouse

324
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.939
all of our mistakes.

325
00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:30.416
Remember the old days when things went bad in England?

326
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:32.347
When people were criminals, they would ship them

327
00:16:32.347 --> 00:16:35.941
off to Australia or some other outback place?

328
00:16:35.941 --> 00:16:37.776
That's it, just exile them.

329
00:16:37.776 --> 00:16:42.776
Now we stick them in big brick and steel buildings

330
00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:45.071
because we see them as enemies.

331
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:47.695
We don't see ourselves as having any responsibility

332
00:16:47.695 --> 00:16:49.828
to rehabilitate them, nor do we see

333
00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:53.892
any responsibility in terms of our training children

334
00:16:53.892 --> 00:16:56.260
in such a way that they won't end up in that situation.

335
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.332
But it makes a lot of money.

336
00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:03.203
When you see an imbalance out there,

337
00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:05.667
and you wonder, how can normally

338
00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:08.888
sensitive human beings, all of us are caring,

339
00:17:08.888 --> 00:17:10.403
all of us are loving.

340
00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:11.864
We love our families.

341
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.373
Nobody means ill to anyone else,

342
00:17:15.373 --> 00:17:20.373
but the system forces us into conflict with each other,

343
00:17:22.104 --> 00:17:25.315
the same way as, well, you take Iraq.

344
00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:26.851
Iraq, what's Iraq?

345
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:29.304
The western countries came in and drew a bunch of lines,

346
00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:31.672
and says, "Okay, we're going to call this Iraq."

347
00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:33.923
Those people had nothing in common.

348
00:17:33.923 --> 00:17:35.832
They're three totally different groups,

349
00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:39.010
tribes that had lived for untold centuries.

350
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.058
They had their own balance.

351
00:17:41.058 --> 00:17:45.954
We put a line about them and they're put together.

352
00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:49.324
They can't continue their normal separations,

353
00:17:49.324 --> 00:17:52.322
because Saddam Hussein and company wouldn't let them.

354
00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.497
Saddam Hussein is gone and so they're now

355
00:17:54.497 --> 00:17:59.022
in a huge war with each other, murdering each other.

356
00:17:59.022 --> 00:18:00.205
What happens is --

357
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.851
Or the same thing with the poor whites,

358
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:04.461
and the blacks, and the immigrants

359
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:06.296
in the southern part of the country.

360
00:18:06.296 --> 00:18:08.312
They're hating each other. Why?

361
00:18:08.312 --> 00:18:12.141
Because the system has placed them against each other.

362
00:18:12.141 --> 00:18:14.647
If they really knew each other as individuals,

363
00:18:14.647 --> 00:18:16.738
they would love each other.

364
00:18:16.738 --> 00:18:19.223
Our system doesn't look at that,

365
00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:22.284
because the system runs on money.

366
00:18:22.284 --> 00:18:24.289
<v Regina>It really needs to have this polarization</v>

367
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:27.393
in order to keep people in enough desire slash fear --

368
00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:28.321
<v ->Yes.</v>

369
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:31.062
<v Regina>...to keep the system financed.</v>

370
00:18:31.062 --> 00:18:32.950
<v ->Yes, if I can make you afraid,</v>

371
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.595
I can get you to buy an alarm system for your house

372
00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:38.496
or a Smith and Wesson gun, or I can get you

373
00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:41.696
to vote for me because I'm going to build a bigger wall.

374
00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:45.205
Or I'm going to sell you this shampoo

375
00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:47.477
that's going to make sure you don't have dandruff anymore,

376
00:18:47.477 --> 00:18:50.218
because you're an inadequate person if you have dandruff,

377
00:18:50.218 --> 00:18:51.914
and on, and on, and on.

378
00:18:51.914 --> 00:18:53.823
We teach people, "You can't look like this.

379
00:18:53.823 --> 00:18:56.415
"You have to look like this model over here."

380
00:18:56.415 --> 00:18:59.327
You know, 30% of the women in colleges

381
00:18:59.327 --> 00:19:02.346
have clinical eating disorders

382
00:19:02.346 --> 00:19:04.425
that's being created by our media,

383
00:19:04.425 --> 00:19:08.884
which is being fueled by people who are doing it for money.

384
00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:11.902
The war is being run by people who are doing it for money.

385
00:19:11.902 --> 00:19:13.204
<v Regina>Absolutely, pure profit.</v>

386
00:19:13.204 --> 00:19:14.953
<v ->Nobody wants to be in this war,</v>

387
00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.353
but there's a lot of money being made.

388
00:19:16.353 --> 00:19:17.654
<v Regina>Right, by a few.</v>

389
00:19:17.654 --> 00:19:21.430
<v ->Any time there's a lot of money being made by a few,</v>

390
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.638
then that's going to swing the direction

391
00:19:23.638 --> 00:19:25.056
of the whole system.

392
00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:27.008
Suppose it was that way in your family.

393
00:19:27.008 --> 00:19:30.069
If you had a cousin who got very, very rich,

394
00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.979
and then decided, didn't like you

395
00:19:31.979 --> 00:19:33.898
and so paid everybody else not to come

396
00:19:33.898 --> 00:19:36.181
to your birthday party.

397
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:38.869
That would be ludicrous, but that's what happens

398
00:19:38.869 --> 00:19:42.303
in the system that we're in right now.

399
00:19:42.303 --> 00:19:46.239
The medical world was just one aspect

400
00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:50.047
of how the entire system is off.

401
00:19:50.047 --> 00:19:52.095
<v Regina>This requires deep self-evaluation,</v>

402
00:19:52.095 --> 00:19:54.569
and it requires a lot of courage, because you're talking

403
00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:57.897
about a person, first, as you say, look to yourself

404
00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:00.350
and examine what is in conflict internally,

405
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.843
and what is not working for you.

406
00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:03.465
Then, of course, you would have to extend that out

407
00:20:03.465 --> 00:20:06.643
to your immediate relationships,

408
00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:09.342
what's working, what's not working within this?

409
00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:11.251
Then you have to extend it out to,

410
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.875
not just your family, but, say, your workplace

411
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:15.261
or your community.

412
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:18.002
You have to engage others in this same dialogue.

413
00:20:18.002 --> 00:20:21.373
If you can't have, I mean --

414
00:20:21.373 --> 00:20:23.581
The idea, I assume, is to get everybody

415
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:27.189
into this place of reflection so that we can

416
00:20:27.189 --> 00:20:32.189
structure something more in integrity, more whole,

417
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.133
and that means unplugging from almost every

418
00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:36.010
system that's been set up for us.

419
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.875
<v ->That's true.</v>

420
00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:37.983
<v Regina>Everything.</v>

421
00:20:37.983 --> 00:20:40.308
You're talking about the zealotry of a lot of religions,

422
00:20:40.308 --> 00:20:44.671
and certainly political governments, and politics.

423
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:49.268
The same thing even in this radical consumerism we have,

424
00:20:49.268 --> 00:20:51.849
running away with us, teaching women they should be

425
00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:54.910
98 pounds and 5'9".

426
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.233
<v ->Yes.</v>

427
00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:59.838
<v Regina>How do we begin to unravel this?</v>

428
00:20:59.838 --> 00:21:01.875
I would like to get to the World Cafe as well,

429
00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.008
within all of this.

430
00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:07.880
<v ->All of these things, as many as they are,</v>

431
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.880
they're all based upon a very single, simple choice.

432
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:17.117
It's the choice of the paradigm with which you choose

433
00:21:17.117 --> 00:21:19.954
to look at the very next experience

434
00:21:19.954 --> 00:21:22.130
in your life right now.

435
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.660
What I'm saying is this, there's two separate paradigms.

436
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.649
This one that's built upon opposites, polarity,

437
00:21:29.649 --> 00:21:33.852
the principle of dispersion, or as I call it, violence.

438
00:21:33.852 --> 00:21:37.713
The other system, which is the unitary way of thinking,

439
00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.131
it's about love.

440
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.222
It's about the pulling together.

441
00:21:41.222 --> 00:21:44.518
It's about wholeness and whatever that means.

442
00:21:44.518 --> 00:21:47.323
It seems like black and white,

443
00:21:47.323 --> 00:21:50.299
two very different ways of looking at the world.

444
00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:52.848
We need to learn how to look at the world

445
00:21:52.848 --> 00:21:55.269
in this way over here.

446
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:57.914
What we need to realize is, because of the amount

447
00:21:57.914 --> 00:22:01.413
of violence that's been programmed into us,

448
00:22:01.413 --> 00:22:05.551
our bodies, and emotional systems, and minds

449
00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:10.169
are running at a very high level of anxiety and tension.

450
00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:14.564
That anxiety and tension, through the hippocampus

451
00:22:14.564 --> 00:22:17.433
and a number of other structures in the brain,

452
00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:21.614
inhibit the prefrontal cortex from being able

453
00:22:21.614 --> 00:22:25.166
to focus upon what it really needs to focus on.

454
00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:29.742
We have a kind of cultural attention deficit disorder.

455
00:22:29.742 --> 00:22:30.808
<v Regina>Very true.</v>

456
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:35.267
<v ->What's important then, is to quiet that anxiety.</v>

457
00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:38.936
That anxiety can be quieted by choosing

458
00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:43.277
the next thought that you have to be a deeply relaxing one,

459
00:22:43.277 --> 00:22:46.605
to become aware that at this moment in time,

460
00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:49.015
there's no other place that you need to go,

461
00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:51.319
there's nothing else that you need to do,

462
00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:54.263
there's no problem that you have to solve.

463
00:22:54.263 --> 00:22:55.468
You can be here.

464
00:22:55.468 --> 00:22:57.025
<v Regina>Get off your own back, basically.</v>

465
00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:57.857
<v ->Yeah.</v>

466
00:22:57.857 --> 00:22:59.574
You can be here and now.

467
00:22:59.574 --> 00:23:03.851
That this moment is the only moment that exists.

468
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:07.403
You can take a deep breath in, (breathes deeply)

469
00:23:07.403 --> 00:23:10.774
and as you let it out, let go of concern

470
00:23:10.774 --> 00:23:15.299
with everything else in the world except this right here.

471
00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:17.646
(takes a deep breath)

472
00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:21.987
To let go of concern with the past, or the future,

473
00:23:21.987 --> 00:23:23.512
and come into this moment.

474
00:23:23.512 --> 00:23:26.168
We have lots of tools for doing that,

475
00:23:26.168 --> 00:23:31.168
meditation, deep relaxation, self hypnosis, yoga.

476
00:23:31.362 --> 00:23:36.362
Coming into that moment, and then, in that moment,

477
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.959
accessing the fundamental wisdom

478
00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:41.303
that's at the core of our being.

479
00:23:41.303 --> 00:23:44.951
What wisdom means, means making a wise choice.

480
00:23:44.951 --> 00:23:48.705
To make a wise choice now is to choose

481
00:23:48.705 --> 00:23:50.540
to do something I will look back upon

482
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.540
in a month or a year and say, "Good.

483
00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:57.345
"That was a wise choice."

484
00:23:57.345 --> 00:23:59.019
Let's say you decide you want to

485
00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:01.366
do a pre-emptive strike into some country.

486
00:24:01.366 --> 00:24:03.403
This is just a hypothetical example.

487
00:24:03.403 --> 00:24:06.496
You might want to ask yourself,

488
00:24:06.496 --> 00:24:09.163
"How am I going to feel about this in a year?

489
00:24:09.163 --> 00:24:11.861
"How am I going to feel about this in three to five years?"

490
00:24:11.861 --> 00:24:16.861
Then honestly evaluate the information that's there,

491
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:19.871
and say, "What is the wise choice?"

492
00:24:19.871 --> 00:24:22.772
Just as we need to do that as nations and as a planet,

493
00:24:22.772 --> 00:24:27.412
we can do that as human beings starting right now,

494
00:24:27.412 --> 00:24:32.412
to access that place of wisdom within and be at peace,

495
00:24:32.714 --> 00:24:35.914
that place that knows that sometimes

496
00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:38.442
you need to accept with serenity,

497
00:24:38.442 --> 00:24:41.695
and sometimes you have to act with courage.

498
00:24:41.695 --> 00:24:44.500
That place that can allow you to make that choice

499
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.169
in such a way that next week, you will be stronger.

500
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:51.220
Next week, you will be more whole.

501
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.513
<v Regina>Instead, we tend to just react.</v>

502
00:24:53.513 --> 00:24:56.649
<v ->We react because the reaction</v>

503
00:24:56.649 --> 00:24:59.230
creates a great deal of stress,

504
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.432
and the system makes a great deal of money from that stress.

505
00:25:03.432 --> 00:25:06.653
Stress, people gain power from

506
00:25:06.653 --> 00:25:08.371
there being stress in a system.

507
00:25:08.371 --> 00:25:09.533
"I'll lead you."

508
00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:12.370
Anything you can imagine, there's somebody out there

509
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.410
claiming it and wanting to guide this group of people.

510
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.799
"You all follow me, the world's coming to an end."

511
00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:20.146
Or, "These people are going to take away our jobs,"

512
00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:22.748
or whatever it might be.

513
00:25:22.748 --> 00:25:26.166
Not to help the people.

514
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:29.803
Again, it's not aimed toward finding our wholeness,

515
00:25:29.803 --> 00:25:32.032
but in the case of the power-mongers,

516
00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:34.752
it has to do with how do I get more power

517
00:25:34.752 --> 00:25:36.427
into smaller and smaller places,

518
00:25:36.427 --> 00:25:38.773
because there's a lot of money available

519
00:25:38.773 --> 00:25:40.469
to somebody who knows the technology

520
00:25:40.469 --> 00:25:42.976
of condensing power into the hands

521
00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:45.290
of a small number of people.

522
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:50.290
The PR agencies, lobbyists, and so forth.

523
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:54.968
That's what the system's doing out there,

524
00:25:54.968 --> 00:25:58.402
creating, not wholeness, but more separation,

525
00:25:58.402 --> 00:26:00.655
more dispersion, and more violence.

526
00:26:00.655 --> 00:26:03.044
Okay, so we come within to ourselves,

527
00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:07.022
reach that place of wisdom, look honestly at the world

528
00:26:07.022 --> 00:26:10.179
to see it as it truly is, so look honestly at myself,

529
00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:12.291
to realize the power that I have.

530
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:15.491
As an American, to realize that I'm using

531
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:19.885
three to four times more of the earth's bounty

532
00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:23.693
than people in poor countries.

533
00:26:23.693 --> 00:26:24.984
Is that okay?

534
00:26:24.984 --> 00:26:26.658
Is it okay?

535
00:26:26.658 --> 00:26:30.007
Where do I find that arrogance within me

536
00:26:30.007 --> 00:26:33.026
that allows me to go out and by a Porsche,

537
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:37.228
while a baby starves to death every three minutes,

538
00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:39.320
or every three seconds?

539
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.112
It's unbelievable.

540
00:26:41.112 --> 00:26:42.989
<v Regina>It seems that to sustain that kind of system,</v>

541
00:26:42.989 --> 00:26:44.941
you really do have to be more or less

542
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:46.893
in isolation from each other too.

543
00:26:46.893 --> 00:26:49.165
What would happen if people started talking,

544
00:26:49.165 --> 00:26:51.192
and holding hands, and realizing,

545
00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:53.719
we're more alike than we are dissimilar.

546
00:26:53.719 --> 00:26:55.970
To keep people apart, as you say,

547
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.967
the separatism is really critical to the system.

548
00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:01.634
You have been trying to work for a very long time

549
00:27:01.634 --> 00:27:04.471
at bringing people together, at getting dialogue

550
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:07.414
across all boundaries going.

551
00:27:07.414 --> 00:27:09.622
Is this really a key element?

552
00:27:09.622 --> 00:27:12.918
<v ->Yes, it's a crucial element.</v>

553
00:27:12.918 --> 00:27:16.054
We've become accustomed to having someone else

554
00:27:16.054 --> 00:27:19.030
tell us what to do, to see our leadership

555
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.950
as coming from outside.

556
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.043
However we define it, as our father,

557
00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:26.453
or our scout leader, our teacher,

558
00:27:26.453 --> 00:27:31.453
or a super model, or our president,

559
00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:35.276
or our priest, or whoever it might be.

560
00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:37.915
We're accustomed to being led from outside.

561
00:27:37.915 --> 00:27:39.718
<v Regina>You mean the great unifier?</v>

562
00:27:39.718 --> 00:27:40.955
<v ->Yes. (laughing)</v>

563
00:27:40.955 --> 00:27:43.163
<v Regina>I love that one, our president.</v>

564
00:27:43.163 --> 00:27:44.134
<v ->Right.</v>

565
00:27:44.134 --> 00:27:45.691
<v Regina>Declaring he is the great unifier</v>

566
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:49.008
at a time there's never been more division and strife.

567
00:27:49.008 --> 00:27:50.608
Quite interesting.

568
00:27:50.608 --> 00:27:51.845
I'm sorry, go ahead.

569
00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:53.285
Just had to put that one in there.

570
00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:54.256
<v ->Right.</v>

571
00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.026
He turned out to be the great decider instead,

572
00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:57.509
which he definitely was.

573
00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:00.507
<v Regina>Oh yeah, the great decider, the great divider.</v>

574
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:08.060
<v ->Even if we look at the highest echelons of government,</v>

575
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:12.775
we see that people are being led, not from their hearts,

576
00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:17.489
not from their wisdom, but from some catechism,

577
00:28:17.489 --> 00:28:20.742
some set of rules, some set of principles

578
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:24.081
that they're following, or that their cabinet

579
00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:25.734
is telling them.

580
00:28:25.734 --> 00:28:27.568
<v Regina>Like an invisible hand.</v>

581
00:28:27.568 --> 00:28:30.374
<v ->It is an invisible hand, and it's maintained</v>

582
00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:35.374
by this denial, by our inability to really see who we are,

583
00:28:35.621 --> 00:28:38.757
and to really see who others are.

584
00:28:38.757 --> 00:28:42.032
Connecting with others is crucial.

585
00:28:42.032 --> 00:28:44.581
That's why we work with the World Cafe.

586
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:45.765
<v Regina>Let's get into that.</v>

587
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:49.015
Yes, please, tell us about the World Cafe.

588
00:28:50.441 --> 00:28:53.502
<v ->After I had defined for myself the principles</v>

589
00:28:53.502 --> 00:28:56.969
of mind-body medicine for use with individuals,

590
00:28:56.969 --> 00:29:00.072
I studied with a wonderful woman, Virginia Satir,

591
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.822
and learned about how to apply

592
00:29:01.822 --> 00:29:04.808
those principles in families.

593
00:29:04.808 --> 00:29:08.669
Then, in the 1980s, I worked with Juanita Brown,

594
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:10.664
and we looked at how to use these principles

595
00:29:10.664 --> 00:29:15.664
into organizations, how a company could be driven

596
00:29:15.794 --> 00:29:18.599
by their shared spirit, how there could be

597
00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:22.642
a collective sense of wholeness, of consciousness.

598
00:29:22.642 --> 00:29:24.103
How we could be deeply committed

599
00:29:24.103 --> 00:29:26.033
to the same thing and support ourselves,

600
00:29:26.033 --> 00:29:29.404
and create high-performance organizations.

601
00:29:30.504 --> 00:29:33.778
Dr. Brown continued in the 1990s to develop,

602
00:29:33.778 --> 00:29:37.810
using these same principles, the World Cafe.

603
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:41.639
The World Cafe is sort of her recognition

604
00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:44.497
that some of the best and most important thinking

605
00:29:44.497 --> 00:29:47.932
goes on over a cup of tea or a cup of coffee.

606
00:29:47.932 --> 00:29:50.748
In the old style, for instance, in the European,

607
00:29:50.748 --> 00:29:52.763
it's at a cafe.

608
00:29:52.763 --> 00:29:56.475
In drawing a group of people together

609
00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:59.750
to think about something, whether it was a company,

610
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:04.304
or an organization, or it might be two or three

611
00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:06.437
elements of a community that were having

612
00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:08.549
a disagreement about something.

613
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:13.264
She would have them meet all around little tables

614
00:30:13.264 --> 00:30:15.589
of four to six people per table

615
00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:17.935
in a cafe kind of atmosphere.

616
00:30:17.935 --> 00:30:21.444
Nice music playing in the background, flowers on the table,

617
00:30:21.444 --> 00:30:25.295
paper tablecloth with colored pens at the table

618
00:30:25.295 --> 00:30:29.711
so that people could sketch and draw as they talk.

619
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:32.516
You would have three people from, let's say,

620
00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:34.276
three people from one point of view

621
00:30:34.276 --> 00:30:36.857
meeting with three people from the other point of view

622
00:30:36.857 --> 00:30:39.833
around many, many different little tables.

623
00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:44.632
She would have them, initially, discuss something like,

624
00:30:44.632 --> 00:30:48.355
"What is it that has drawn you into

625
00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:52.130
"being interested in this topic that brings us together?"

626
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.757
People would entertain that question together

627
00:30:55.757 --> 00:30:58.477
for maybe 15 minutes.

628
00:30:58.477 --> 00:31:02.370
Everybody would share their personal perspective.

629
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:07.370
Then there would be a break, and all except one

630
00:31:08.044 --> 00:31:10.017
of the people would get up from that table

631
00:31:10.017 --> 00:31:13.635
and find a new table, and re-sort themselves.

632
00:31:13.635 --> 00:31:16.055
The person who remained was the host.

633
00:31:16.055 --> 00:31:19.191
As each new person came, introduced themselves,

634
00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:23.714
they'd sit down, and he would share or she would share

635
00:31:23.714 --> 00:31:25.292
what happened in their group.

636
00:31:25.292 --> 00:31:27.457
Each of the people arriving, "Well, that's interesting,

637
00:31:27.457 --> 00:31:30.081
"because we found in our group so-and-so."

638
00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:32.236
Then after a minute or two, she would say,

639
00:31:32.236 --> 00:31:34.465
"Okay, we're going to go to another question."

640
00:31:34.465 --> 00:31:35.980
She would ask, perhaps the same question,

641
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.667
or maybe another question, such as,

642
00:31:38.667 --> 00:31:41.590
"If we were able to create peace and wholeness

643
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.590
"in this community, what's your best dream

644
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:49.301
"for how the outcome could look if we were successful?

645
00:31:49.301 --> 00:31:52.416
"Don't ask how, but suppose it all worked out."

646
00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:55.616
People would again share, but the idea in sharing

647
00:31:55.616 --> 00:31:59.082
is not to make other people listen to your point of view,

648
00:31:59.082 --> 00:32:01.695
but listen to the concept that's arising

649
00:32:01.695 --> 00:32:03.604
in the middle of the table,

650
00:32:03.604 --> 00:32:06.111
the magic in the middle, the unity.

651
00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:07.882
Where do we all connect?

652
00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:09.268
Don't worry about how we differ,

653
00:32:09.268 --> 00:32:10.964
focus on how we connect.

654
00:32:10.964 --> 00:32:14.281
After 15 minutes, they may break and go to another table,

655
00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:15.913
maybe answer another question.

656
00:32:15.913 --> 00:32:20.574
Well, the energy in the room starts going higher and higher

657
00:32:20.574 --> 00:32:22.974
as people start making personal contact,

658
00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:25.662
respecting other people's values,

659
00:32:25.662 --> 00:32:28.723
respecting the principles that they live by,

660
00:32:28.723 --> 00:32:31.560
respecting the vision and intelligence they have.

661
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.037
All of the sudden, says, "Oh my gosh, you know,

662
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:37.458
"he's an immigrant but he's intelligent,

663
00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:39.965
"and he loves his family just as I do."

664
00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:41.170
<v Regina>He wants the same things</v>

665
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.378
for his family, and his community, and his world.

666
00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:44.743
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

667
00:32:44.743 --> 00:32:47.346
"Well, gee, if it's possible for us to solve this

668
00:32:47.346 --> 00:32:50.300
"in a way that satisfies everybody's needs,

669
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.850
"boy, I really want to do that."

670
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.473
Then we'd stop the cafe for a moment

671
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:56.913
and people would share out,

672
00:32:56.913 --> 00:33:00.049
"What do you hear emerging from the conversations

673
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:01.979
"that you've been in?"

674
00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:04.721
People stand up, and these wonderfully

675
00:33:04.721 --> 00:33:07.057
creative ideas come about.

676
00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:09.456
Meanwhile, we have a graphic recorder

677
00:33:09.456 --> 00:33:12.560
who's recording all these things that are being spoken

678
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.837
by drawing beautiful pictures, visual graphics,

679
00:33:16.837 --> 00:33:20.229
as well as a few words, so at the end of the day,

680
00:33:20.229 --> 00:33:21.829
and there are a few other things that we do,

681
00:33:21.829 --> 00:33:23.290
but you get the idea.

682
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.839
It's how you develop that wholeness,

683
00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.791
represented graphically in such a way

684
00:33:27.791 --> 00:33:29.999
that people can, later in the day,

685
00:33:29.999 --> 00:33:31.855
simply look through the images there

686
00:33:31.855 --> 00:33:35.204
and remember the whole path of the conversation

687
00:33:35.204 --> 00:33:36.804
of this group of people.

688
00:33:36.804 --> 00:33:41.102
That may be 12 people, or it could be 1200,

689
00:33:41.102 --> 00:33:43.908
or I think it's been up to 6 or 7,000 people

690
00:33:43.908 --> 00:33:46.179
have been worked with in this way.

691
00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:49.150
<v Regina>This is a global affair.</v>

692
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.744
<v ->That's right.</v>

693
00:33:51.422 --> 00:33:54.142
We've made a couple of videos of it

694
00:33:54.142 --> 00:33:57.160
that are available right now at places like,

695
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.976
on TheWorldCafe.com.

696
00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:03.432
You can see videos of just how it works

697
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:05.778
and what people's experience of it is.

698
00:34:05.778 --> 00:34:07.826
It doesn't belong to anybody.

699
00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:10.354
This isn't a company.

700
00:34:10.354 --> 00:34:14.140
Juanita and her partner did a wonderful thing

701
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.023
after building this for years, just last year,

702
00:34:18.023 --> 00:34:21.404
they gave it to the World Cafe community.

703
00:34:21.404 --> 00:34:25.052
It's about 5 or 10,000 people who are practicing it.

704
00:34:25.052 --> 00:34:29.094
It brings community and harmony to groups of people,

705
00:34:29.094 --> 00:34:33.808
and most important, teaches them the value,

706
00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:35.707
and the importance, and the technology

707
00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:39.632
of how to have good conversations with another person,

708
00:34:39.632 --> 00:34:41.957
how to have a conversation with a person

709
00:34:41.957 --> 00:34:44.389
where you respect the other person,

710
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:47.013
where you honestly appreciate that person,

711
00:34:47.013 --> 00:34:51.130
where you honor and appreciate that person's beliefs

712
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.519
and their standards, where you trust

713
00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:57.146
that there's another loving human being inside the other,

714
00:34:57.146 --> 00:35:00.294
even if it's an adversary.

715
00:35:00.294 --> 00:35:04.080
To use Gandhi's admonition, which is,

716
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.267
"The ally you must always seek

717
00:35:06.267 --> 00:35:10.277
"is the part of your adversary that knows what is right."

718
00:35:10.277 --> 00:35:13.018
That's what's going to save the world,

719
00:35:13.018 --> 00:35:14.831
because you know what we need,

720
00:35:14.831 --> 00:35:17.477
and I know what we need.

721
00:35:17.477 --> 00:35:19.642
Mr. Bush knows what we need.

722
00:35:19.642 --> 00:35:22.916
Osama Bin Laden knows what we need.

723
00:35:22.916 --> 00:35:25.007
The man next door knows what we need.

724
00:35:25.007 --> 00:35:28.580
The people down where you work know what we need.

725
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.580
All we need to do is to learn how to be quiet for a while,

726
00:35:34.223 --> 00:35:37.211
to look within, and to realize that we need to

727
00:35:37.211 --> 00:35:40.251
awaken the leader that's inside,

728
00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:42.672
that we need to lead our own lives.

729
00:35:42.672 --> 00:35:46.032
I talked before about this pyramidal structure

730
00:35:46.032 --> 00:35:49.306
that most of the organizations,

731
00:35:49.306 --> 00:35:53.231
and gatherings, and communities in our culture have,

732
00:35:53.231 --> 00:35:56.228
in which there's the top guy, who's really powerful,

733
00:35:56.228 --> 00:36:01.177
and a few people that will take a bullet for the top guy,

734
00:36:01.177 --> 00:36:03.375
and so forth down like that.

735
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:05.007
Instead of looking for that leadership

736
00:36:05.007 --> 00:36:08.004
just coming from the outside, because we've been misled,

737
00:36:08.004 --> 00:36:12.025
enormously, enormously misled.

738
00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:15.854
When you talk about conflict, when you talk about

739
00:36:15.854 --> 00:36:18.712
the division between people, when you talk about

740
00:36:18.712 --> 00:36:21.006
what I saw in medicine or what you see in the building

741
00:36:21.006 --> 00:36:24.451
of jails instead of hospitals, think about people

742
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:28.738
being murdered in wars, and being sent home

743
00:36:28.738 --> 00:36:30.690
without arms and legs.

744
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.697
We just look at, "Oh, it's only 4 or 5,000

745
00:36:32.697 --> 00:36:34.851
"that have been killed in the war."

746
00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:37.593
Five times that many have physical illnesses

747
00:36:37.593 --> 00:36:41.006
that are going to plague them for the rest of their lives --

748
00:36:41.006 --> 00:36:42.542
<v Regina>That doesn't even count the Iraqis,</v>

749
00:36:42.542 --> 00:36:43.672
quote, "the enemy."

750
00:36:43.672 --> 00:36:45.112
<v ->Right, thank you.</v>

751
00:36:45.112 --> 00:36:46.808
<v Regina>Goodness, children and women.</v>

752
00:36:46.808 --> 00:36:47.789
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

753
00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:51.149
The estimate is 80 to a million have been killed,

754
00:36:51.149 --> 00:36:52.685
and how many have been wounded?

755
00:36:52.685 --> 00:36:56.471
Let's not even talk about the psychological damage

756
00:36:56.471 --> 00:36:57.655
that's been done.

757
00:36:57.655 --> 00:37:01.484
That's not talk about the enemies that we're all making.

758
00:37:01.484 --> 00:37:04.503
Insane, and war after war.

759
00:37:04.503 --> 00:37:08.919
We start the Spanish American War, and blame it on Spain

760
00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:12.844
because we want Cuba, and we die for that.

761
00:37:12.844 --> 00:37:16.460
The Gulf of Tonkin event, purely fictitious.

762
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.686
There was no shooting.

763
00:37:17.686 --> 00:37:19.225
I know a man who was on the boat.

764
00:37:19.225 --> 00:37:20.761
There was no shooting.

765
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:25.020
Everyone who died in Vietnam, all of that

766
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.945
agony that went on in our culture,

767
00:37:28.945 --> 00:37:30.502
parents disowning their children

768
00:37:30.502 --> 00:37:32.379
for burning their draft cards,

769
00:37:32.379 --> 00:37:34.662
the shootings at Kent State.

770
00:37:34.662 --> 00:37:38.533
60,000 died in the war, more than twice that many

771
00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:41.275
have committed suicide since they've come home

772
00:37:41.275 --> 00:37:43.248
because of a lie.

773
00:37:43.248 --> 00:37:45.040
Now we have yellowcake uranium.

774
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.405
It goes on and on.

775
00:37:46.405 --> 00:37:47.173
Why?

776
00:37:47.173 --> 00:37:50.511
Not because anybody wants anyone to die.

777
00:37:50.511 --> 00:37:52.538
Not because anybody wants to be cruel

778
00:37:52.538 --> 00:37:55.343
or to take someone else's right to life away,

779
00:37:55.343 --> 00:37:59.151
but the system is forcing us into it.

780
00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:00.868
What we need to do is to discover

781
00:38:00.868 --> 00:38:04.494
a new form of leadership, a distributed leadership,

782
00:38:04.494 --> 00:38:08.302
like a healthy family where people see each other

783
00:38:08.302 --> 00:38:11.161
as equals, and honor each other,

784
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:13.337
see the good in each other, and say,

785
00:38:13.337 --> 00:38:15.779
"What is it that we can do with each other?"

786
00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:19.512
How to make stone soup, and those are the principles

787
00:38:19.512 --> 00:38:22.253
that the World Cafe teaches.

788
00:38:22.253 --> 00:38:26.040
How to treat another person in such a way

789
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.221
as to create a unit, a cell, if you will,

790
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:32.653
of distributed leadership.

791
00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:35.671
But you can't contribute to that very well

792
00:38:35.671 --> 00:38:38.743
until you understand how to lead yourself,

793
00:38:38.743 --> 00:38:41.847
and that's the awakening the leader within.

794
00:38:41.847 --> 00:38:44.961
That's the first step, get quiet.

795
00:38:44.961 --> 00:38:49.836
Second step, go to that leader within.

796
00:38:49.836 --> 00:38:52.673
The third step is examining the world

797
00:38:52.673 --> 00:38:54.966
to see the truth of what's going on,

798
00:38:54.966 --> 00:38:59.360
and to be willing to question, be willing to question.

799
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.765
If you're Republican, be willing to question deeply.

800
00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:06.859
If you're a Democrat, be willing to question deeply.

801
00:39:06.859 --> 00:39:09.184
To question deeply what's going on,

802
00:39:09.184 --> 00:39:11.082
to be willing to see whatever's there,

803
00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.314
to be willing to come out of denial,

804
00:39:14.314 --> 00:39:18.164
to be free of the automatic defensive response,

805
00:39:18.164 --> 00:39:19.391
to learn how to do that.

806
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:21.343
It's not really difficult.

807
00:39:21.343 --> 00:39:22.836
It doesn't require anyone else.

808
00:39:22.836 --> 00:39:24.969
You can do it within yourself.

809
00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:29.684
Then looking at the world to see the truth of what is.

810
00:39:29.684 --> 00:39:32.745
If you then look within yourself,

811
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:37.534
you'll discover that you have something that you can provide

812
00:39:37.534 --> 00:39:40.104
to make that world different.

813
00:39:40.104 --> 00:39:42.248
<v Regina>This is true, and I think, to a large extent,</v>

814
00:39:42.248 --> 00:39:44.360
this is also worth having that dialogue,

815
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.560
and knowing your neighbor,

816
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.418
and everyone is your neighbor,

817
00:39:50.418 --> 00:39:52.594
comes in because there ultimately has to be

818
00:39:52.594 --> 00:39:56.125
a different type of decision that you make.

819
00:39:56.125 --> 00:39:58.727
There can't be runaway consumption

820
00:39:58.727 --> 00:40:01.906
in the industrialized world, and abject poverty,

821
00:40:01.906 --> 00:40:05.934
and the quote, "undeveloped world,"

822
00:40:05.934 --> 00:40:08.654
It's like, who unplugs first?

823
00:40:08.654 --> 00:40:10.862
It's like, who lays down their arms first?

824
00:40:10.862 --> 00:40:13.848
By knowing each other and seeing each other's eyeballs,

825
00:40:13.848 --> 00:40:16.760
it seems to me, that's a critical piece

826
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.237
of saying, "Let's do it together, even if it's just two."

827
00:40:20.237 --> 00:40:22.957
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

828
00:40:22.957 --> 00:40:24.397
Even if it's just two.

829
00:40:24.397 --> 00:40:27.106
To be able to see the other person,

830
00:40:27.106 --> 00:40:30.754
to be able to discover what it means to say

831
00:40:30.754 --> 00:40:34.615
that there's a oneness that we're both part of.

832
00:40:34.615 --> 00:40:37.977
If people who are religious, usually,

833
00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:42.083
some part of their religion says that we're all one.

834
00:40:42.083 --> 00:40:44.429
The Christian religion says we're all one

835
00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:46.242
in the Body of Christ.

836
00:40:46.242 --> 00:40:48.077
That's what the Body of Christ is,

837
00:40:48.077 --> 00:40:51.746
the wholeness of who we are, every culture says that.

838
00:40:51.746 --> 00:40:54.466
The Muslims say that too.

839
00:40:54.466 --> 00:40:59.466
There's only one, except that in addition, they say,

840
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.324
"We're all one, we Christians, but..."

841
00:41:03.324 --> 00:41:04.412
You know?

842
00:41:04.412 --> 00:41:06.087
<v Regina>Yeah, we Christians are all one.</v>

843
00:41:06.087 --> 00:41:08.337
<v ->Yeah, we Christians are all one, but those,</v>

844
00:41:08.337 --> 00:41:11.804
they could be one if they realize the error of their ways.

845
00:41:11.804 --> 00:41:12.657
<v Regina>And convert.</v>

846
00:41:12.657 --> 00:41:13.542
<v ->And convert.</v>

847
00:41:13.542 --> 00:41:15.579
Which was the same thing Osama Bin Laden said

848
00:41:15.579 --> 00:41:17.489
in one of his recent tapes.

849
00:41:17.489 --> 00:41:19.878
I'll go easy on you if you'll convert.

850
00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:21.158
<v Regina>Right.</v>

851
00:41:21.158 --> 00:41:23.803
This insanity isn't working.

852
00:41:23.803 --> 00:41:25.747
This separatism isn't working.

853
00:41:25.747 --> 00:41:26.686
(laughing)

854
00:41:26.686 --> 00:41:31.485
<v ->It's not working, and what most people don't realize,</v>

855
00:41:31.485 --> 00:41:34.045
and we project it out there and say,

856
00:41:34.045 --> 00:41:36.733
"Bush is crazy, and Bin Laden's crazy.

857
00:41:36.733 --> 00:41:41.733
"They're blind," or, "Democrats are blind," or whatever,

858
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:47.683
to realize that each of us is doing it in our own lives.

859
00:41:47.683 --> 00:41:50.904
Each of us is being blind in our own lives.

860
00:41:50.904 --> 00:41:54.989
We allow ourselves to be racist, to be classist.

861
00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:58.200
We allow ourselves to be abusive of other people

862
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.920
in our attitudes.

863
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:04.931
One example that occurred to me is a story I heard.

864
00:42:04.931 --> 00:42:08.760
It took place, I think, in the '30s or '40s.

865
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.270
Jascha Heifetz, the wonderful violinist,

866
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:14.456
had a concert at Carnegie Hall.

867
00:42:14.456 --> 00:42:17.261
He arrived an hour ahead of time,

868
00:42:17.261 --> 00:42:20.952
wearing old raggedy clothes, opened his violin case,

869
00:42:20.952 --> 00:42:22.488
and threw a couple of dollar bills in it,

870
00:42:22.488 --> 00:42:24.482
and stood out in front of the box office,

871
00:42:24.482 --> 00:42:29.133
and played his entire performance for the night.

872
00:42:29.133 --> 00:42:33.975
People walked by him, rushing to get to the ticket office.

873
00:42:33.975 --> 00:42:35.233
<v Regina>Isn't that amazing?</v>

874
00:42:35.233 --> 00:42:36.769
<v ->Then, when he walked out on stage,</v>

875
00:42:36.769 --> 00:42:38.977
the audience was...

876
00:42:38.977 --> 00:42:40.598
<v Regina>Isn't that amazing?</v>

877
00:42:40.598 --> 00:42:43.340
<v ->They were there to wear their mink coats,</v>

878
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.846
and to come to see the great Jascha Heifetz,

879
00:42:45.846 --> 00:42:47.915
and nobody stopped and said, "My gosh,

880
00:42:47.915 --> 00:42:52.374
"what beautiful music that tramp is playing."

881
00:42:52.374 --> 00:42:53.664
This is how we are.

882
00:42:53.664 --> 00:42:56.341
We hide behind labels.

883
00:42:56.341 --> 00:42:57.707
We don't see the truth.

884
00:42:57.707 --> 00:43:01.259
We don't see what we're doing to others.

885
00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:04.256
We punish others, and we're cruel to others,

886
00:43:04.256 --> 00:43:06.975
and we feel justified because they deserved it.

887
00:43:06.975 --> 00:43:08.949
This is their deserved punishment,

888
00:43:08.949 --> 00:43:10.431
so I'm not going to talk to you,

889
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:12.564
or I'm going to attack you, or I'm going to

890
00:43:12.564 --> 00:43:16.842
assassinate your character, or I'm going to cheat you,

891
00:43:16.842 --> 00:43:21.842
I'm going to trick you, I'm going to cheat on you.

892
00:43:24.105 --> 00:43:26.985
We feel justified in doing it because, well,

893
00:43:26.985 --> 00:43:29.822
after all, your family did this to my family,

894
00:43:29.822 --> 00:43:31.934
or, you're a rich person so you won't mind

895
00:43:31.934 --> 00:43:33.950
if I steal this from you.

896
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:38.408
Or, you're a bad guy, so it's okay if I shoot you.

897
00:43:38.408 --> 00:43:41.757
Or, you're a Muslim, or from the United States,

898
00:43:41.757 --> 00:43:46.162
therefore I can shoot you, or whatever it may be,

899
00:43:46.162 --> 00:43:49.181
it's all the same, but we need to be able to see it

900
00:43:49.181 --> 00:43:53.353
in our own individual lives.

901
00:43:53.353 --> 00:43:55.998
Republicans don't think they have a blind spot,

902
00:43:55.998 --> 00:43:58.880
and the Democrats, I'm talking about the vocal ones

903
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.037
who are the red state, blue state, you know?

904
00:44:02.037 --> 00:44:03.530
"Oh, you're a Democrat?

905
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.386
"Sorry, we can't date anymore."

906
00:44:05.386 --> 00:44:09.844
It's like, "They're all crazy.

907
00:44:09.844 --> 00:44:11.679
"They're all misled.

908
00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:14.793
"They don't see."

909
00:44:14.793 --> 00:44:17.641
Meanwhile, they're saying, "They don't see."

910
00:44:17.641 --> 00:44:20.777
Maybe none of us are seeing.

911
00:44:20.777 --> 00:44:24.425
The only way to find out is to go to that place within

912
00:44:24.425 --> 00:44:28.510
and be willing to take that honest look at yourself.

913
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:32.552
If you're not in denial, you'll go, "Oh, incredible,

914
00:44:32.552 --> 00:44:35.891
"I'm just as enlightened as I thought I was all along."

915
00:44:35.891 --> 00:44:40.765
If you discover you are in denial, then you ask yourself,

916
00:44:40.765 --> 00:44:45.223
"Is there something in me that wants integrity?

917
00:44:45.223 --> 00:44:48.199
"Is there something in me that wants what I feel,

918
00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:51.474
"and what I say, what I do, and what I believe

919
00:44:51.474 --> 00:44:55.516
"to all be the same, to be congruent with each other?"

920
00:44:55.516 --> 00:45:00.516
If so, maybe I want to come out of that denial

921
00:45:00.924 --> 00:45:05.051
and begin to change the way I interact with the world,

922
00:45:05.051 --> 00:45:07.142
with the way I treat people around me,

923
00:45:07.142 --> 00:45:10.022
with the way I treat my planet,

924
00:45:10.022 --> 00:45:14.161
how I look at health, wholeness, stability,

925
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:19.099
relationship, love, community.

926
00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:23.728
How do I leverage my privilege?

927
00:45:23.728 --> 00:45:26.415
It's we, the people who are watching me now,

928
00:45:26.415 --> 00:45:28.389
the people who are intelligent,

929
00:45:28.389 --> 00:45:30.479
the people who have the power.

930
00:45:30.479 --> 00:45:33.039
We have the power to change it.

931
00:45:33.039 --> 00:45:37.721
It's we, we are the leaders we've been waiting for.

932
00:45:37.721 --> 00:45:41.231
We need to learn how to be able to be in groups

933
00:45:41.231 --> 00:45:46.231
where we're not bouncing off each other's egos,

934
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.404
but being deeply committed to something

935
00:45:50.404 --> 00:45:52.826
that we really care about.

936
00:45:52.826 --> 00:45:55.961
I think the world is ready.

937
00:45:55.961 --> 00:45:59.534
I'm totally in agreement with ex-President Richard Nixon,

938
00:45:59.534 --> 00:46:01.668
the plaque he had on his wall,

939
00:46:01.668 --> 00:46:03.268
"When you've got them by the cajones,

940
00:46:03.268 --> 00:46:05.614
"their hearts and minds will follow."

941
00:46:05.614 --> 00:46:06.894
(Regina laughing)

942
00:46:06.894 --> 00:46:10.051
Well, terrorism has us by the cajones.

943
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:14.190
We cannot win a war against terrorism.

944
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:18.212
It won't happen outside of having complete martial law,

945
00:46:18.212 --> 00:46:21.582
and a fascist police state at home.

946
00:46:21.582 --> 00:46:22.884
<v Regina>We're marching toward that.</v>

947
00:46:22.884 --> 00:46:25.060
<v ->We are marching more and more rapidly,</v>

948
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:30.060
like lemmings screaming and yelling, waving our flags.

949
00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:33.909
We are creating terrorists at home.

950
00:46:33.909 --> 00:46:36.991
Up until now, they've all been Middle-Eastern terrorists

951
00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:38.645
who couldn't speak very good English,

952
00:46:38.645 --> 00:46:40.821
and we still couldn't stop them.

953
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:43.860
But now, they're right here at home.

954
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.956
There are terrorist cells growing right here at home,

955
00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:52.244
and it's not hard to destroy a free society.

956
00:46:52.244 --> 00:46:54.644
<v Regina>Just like it's not hard to kill a healthy body.</v>

957
00:46:54.644 --> 00:46:57.054
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

958
00:46:57.054 --> 00:46:59.751
I think, you know, what was it?

959
00:46:59.751 --> 00:47:03.324
In the old story of Jack Benny used to tell,

960
00:47:03.324 --> 00:47:06.086
where the crook steps out of the shadows

961
00:47:06.086 --> 00:47:08.113
and puts a gun up against his head, and says,

962
00:47:08.113 --> 00:47:10.246
"Okay, your money or your life."

963
00:47:10.246 --> 00:47:12.987
Jack Benny says, "Can I have a moment to think about it?"

964
00:47:12.987 --> 00:47:14.726
(both laughing)

965
00:47:14.726 --> 00:47:16.742
Because of his stinginess.

966
00:47:16.742 --> 00:47:19.259
Are we that stingy or can we realize

967
00:47:19.259 --> 00:47:22.341
that this is a life or death struggle?

968
00:47:22.341 --> 00:47:23.621
This is a life or death struggle,

969
00:47:23.621 --> 00:47:28.058
and the struggle has to do with whether or not

970
00:47:28.058 --> 00:47:30.309
we're going to see those people who are in prisons

971
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:33.658
as human beings that we can communicate with,

972
00:47:33.658 --> 00:47:36.975
not animals that we should toughen and make even,

973
00:47:36.975 --> 00:47:39.855
even more angry, and even more resentful

974
00:47:39.855 --> 00:47:42.829
to go out and create the damage in the world.

975
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:45.868
Are we going to take a look across the aisle

976
00:47:45.868 --> 00:47:50.868
and drop this Republican versus Democrat thing?

977
00:47:51.137 --> 00:47:55.553
Are we going to say, what we have is so much greater

978
00:47:55.553 --> 00:47:57.132
than what we share?

979
00:47:57.132 --> 00:47:58.966
What we share is so much greater

980
00:47:58.966 --> 00:48:02.859
than what we have as differences?

981
00:48:02.859 --> 00:48:06.902
That our wholeness, that which brings us together,

982
00:48:06.902 --> 00:48:09.504
is much more important and much stronger

983
00:48:09.504 --> 00:48:12.053
than that which tends to separate us.

984
00:48:12.053 --> 00:48:14.816
We have the ability to choose that.

985
00:48:14.816 --> 00:48:17.536
We have the ability to see each other as human beings,

986
00:48:17.536 --> 00:48:20.832
and to say, "There's room enough

987
00:48:20.832 --> 00:48:22.709
"in this world for all of us."

988
00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:25.386
We can live our lives differently.

989
00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:28.308
We can make new choices.

990
00:48:28.308 --> 00:48:30.751
We can take care of each other.

991
00:48:30.751 --> 00:48:33.065
Until we begin to recognize that that's true.

992
00:48:33.065 --> 00:48:36.084
The tools are here to do it,

993
00:48:36.084 --> 00:48:39.060
and I think we have the gun to our head,

994
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.865
and I think that gradually people are going to hear me

995
00:48:41.865 --> 00:48:43.305
and the many other people who are saying

996
00:48:43.305 --> 00:48:48.305
exactly the same thing, and say, maybe he's right.

997
00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:50.920
Maybe I should take a moment

998
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.568
and see how much denial I'm in, and come out of it.

999
00:48:54.568 --> 00:48:58.610
Maybe the health of my children is dependent upon it.

1000
00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.650
Maybe my own life, and the lives of those that I care about

1001
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:04.391
is immediately dependent upon it.

1002
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:06.855
Maybe the health of the planet

1003
00:49:06.855 --> 00:49:09.774
is dependent upon my taking a look at things.

1004
00:49:09.774 --> 00:49:13.720
Maybe I have some responsibility in this whole thing.

1005
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.720
The amazing thing is that when one wakes up to that,

1006
00:49:18.925 --> 00:49:22.893
it's a wonderful feeling, because we all feel helpless.

1007
00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:25.400
We all feel pounded by all these forces

1008
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.789
that are too big for us.

1009
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:30.882
Suddenly you realize, "Oh, wait a minute.

1010
00:49:30.882 --> 00:49:33.783
"We can do something," and we start telling people,

1011
00:49:33.783 --> 00:49:36.311
"Hey, you don't have to feel that way."

1012
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:37.655
They go, "Really?"

1013
00:49:37.655 --> 00:49:38.679
You go, "Yeah."

1014
00:49:38.679 --> 00:49:40.748
They go, "Oh, tell me," and it feels really good

1015
00:49:40.748 --> 00:49:42.860
to share this with another person.

1016
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.412
As you get more people who begin to recognize this,

1017
00:49:46.412 --> 00:49:49.803
and begin to work together, you get something

1018
00:49:49.803 --> 00:49:51.860
called team spirit.

1019
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.833
In other words, there's a new whole,

1020
00:49:53.833 --> 00:49:56.436
a new entity defined, which is the team,

1021
00:49:56.436 --> 00:49:59.667
and it has a life of its own.

1022
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:03.331
That life can nurture us.

1023
00:50:04.147 --> 00:50:05.374
<v ->What we didn't talk about is that</v>

1024
00:50:05.374 --> 00:50:07.816
Emmett was the first to bring guided meditation

1025
00:50:07.816 --> 00:50:10.621
and self-healing to public via tapes and CDs.

1026
00:50:10.621 --> 00:50:13.459
His work on deep healing is available on his site,

1027
00:50:13.459 --> 00:50:15.826
which you can find by clicking on the link below.

1028
00:50:15.826 --> 00:50:17.565
If you're ready to ask the deep questions,

1029
00:50:17.565 --> 00:50:20.167
you can also find a link to the World Cafe.

1030
00:50:20.167 --> 00:50:23.159
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1031
00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:27.638
(gentle instrumental music)
