00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:01.888
<v ->For those of you who have seen the movie</v>

00:00:01.888 --> 00:00:03.627
The Manchurian Candidate

3
00:00:03.627 --> 00:00:06.091
you'll find this interview beyond intriguing.

4
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.374
Dr. Nick Begich has spent the last decade

5
00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:11.734
investigating the use of 21st century technologies

6
00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.920
and their affects on our brain.

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.734
It probably doesn't surprise you to know

8
00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.027
that technologies that produced this effect

9
00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:20.352
on people actually exist.

10
00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.527
Let's hear what Dr. Begich has to say

11
00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:25.519
about these well-cloaked technologies.

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.159
<v Voiceover>As we've been talking about</v>

13
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.186
some of the 21st century technologies,

14
00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:40.671
one area that can't be ignored is that our

15
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:44.952
brains are being affected by a lot of external forces.

16
00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:47.699
Electromagnetic, radio frequencies, et cetera.

17
00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.299
Can you give us a little bit of background

18
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.836
on the ways in which we're being impacted at this time.

19
00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:54.427
<v ->Sure. This area we consider the most</v>

20
00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:57.223
controversial area that we've covered in the last 11 years.

21
00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.421
And it's an area that I'm committing the next five years

22
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:01.906
to educate the public around the world on,

23
00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.468
because I think it is the most important technology.

24
00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.040
The idea of interfering with the human brain

25
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.061
either from external sources without our consent

26
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.172
is a significant issue for me.

27
00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.293
In the United States, according to

28
00:01:14.293 --> 00:01:16.149
Secretary of Energy O'Leary when she was

29
00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.378
in that position under the Clinton Administration,

30
00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.787
she had said that over a half a million Americans

31
00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:22.953
in a 40 year period had been victims of

32
00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.247
human experimentation in the United States

33
00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:26.760
without their consent.

34
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.734
<v Voiceover>You said 40 million?</v>

35
00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.166
<v ->500,000.
<v Voiceover>Oh, I'm sorry.</v>

36
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.139
<v ->Over a half a million over 40 years.</v>

37
00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:34.205
<v Voiceover>Over 40 years.</v>

38
00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:35.485
<v ->So lots of different things.</v>

39
00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:40.296
From syphilis being given to a black man in the Southeast

40
00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:42.149
to see how they would die over time,

41
00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.104
to radioactive iodine in Inupiats in Alaska

42
00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.689
to see how they would die over time,

43
00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.428
and many, many other things.

44
00:01:48.428 --> 00:01:51.072
One of the most extraordinary reports

45
00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:53.717
came out in the early '70s during a number

46
00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:54.965
of congressional hearings,

47
00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:56.383
and there was actually a presidential report

48
00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.592
issued in June of 1975.

49
00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:01.514
And it was on CIA abuses within the United States.

50
00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:03.135
It was a report to the President.

51
00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:05.439
What was contained in that was a chapter

52
00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.063
talking about mind manipulation

53
00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:09.737
using chemical means and programs

54
00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:12.404
MKUltra and their associated programs

55
00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:14.825
run by the Central Intelligence Agency.

56
00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:16.777
And all of these things are referenced in our written work.

57
00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:19.624
We have hundreds and hundreds of reference sources.

58
00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:21.854
But when you look at what they were doing then,

59
00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.689
it was primarily chemical means.

60
00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.683
At least that's what made it into the literature.

61
00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:27.517
When you go back even further,

62
00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:29.885
if you go back to say the Korean era,

63
00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:34.183
in that era we had servicemen returning from warfare,

64
00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:37.160
and they were exhibiting these very bizarre behaviors.

65
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.228
These patriotic young guys were coming back

66
00:02:39.228 --> 00:02:42.055
and handing communist leaflets on street corners.

67
00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:45.213
And this is where the term "brainwashing"

68
00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:47.921
was actually coined, was in that era.

69
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:49.842
And so our government began to look.

70
00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:53.307
What did they do? And can we do it, too?

71
00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.121
Became the equation.

72
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:57.255
So as you look all the way into the '50s

73
00:02:57.255 --> 00:02:58.972
and into the early '60s,

74
00:02:58.972 --> 00:03:00.902
these technologies were being explored.

75
00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:03.685
By the early '60s we'd captured a device.

76
00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:05.777
It was actually during the Vietnam era,

77
00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:07.291
and we captured a Russian device called

78
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:08.228
the Lida machine.

79
00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:09.840
L-I-D-A.

80
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.144
Which was actually looked at by a guy named Ross Adey,

81
00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:14.630
one of the leading researchers again for military.

82
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.188
He looked at this,

83
00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:19.800
and it was used for putting military prisoners of war

84
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.607
into trance-like states using flickering lights and sound,

85
00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:25.954
electromagnetic field oscillations,

86
00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:28.257
so you would get in a very relaxed state.

87
00:03:28.257 --> 00:03:30.017
In a state where they could extract intelligence

88
00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.927
much more efficiently from you.

89
00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:34.336
That became a whole new review for

90
00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:36.705
military technologists in this country,

91
00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.955
thinking maybe we can use electromagnetic

92
00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:41.376
fields to manipulate what's going on in the brain.

93
00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:44.577
In 1969 there was a book published called

94
00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:46.570
Towards a Psycho Civilized Society.

95
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.546
And this was put together by Jose Delgado.

96
00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:52.918
And he had his doctorate in electrophysiology

97
00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:55.284
from the University of Madrid from 1950.

98
00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:58.303
He came over to Yale University in the mid-'60s.

99
00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:00.458
And began mapping the human brain,

100
00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.346
stimulating the human brain, and primates,

101
00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.933
and bulls, and animals, all different kinds of animals.

102
00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:06.929
Stimulating different parts of the brain to see

103
00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.560
what parts where responsible for what

104
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.739
kinds of action or cognitive functions and so on.

105
00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.619
So what he was doing in those days in the '60s

106
00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.752
was he was implanting micro circuits.

107
00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:18.768
Well, not micro circuits. Circuits.

108
00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:20.442
And stimulating them with RF.

109
00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:22.000
Radio frequency energy.

110
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.304
So one of the illustrations or photographs shows

111
00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:25.945
a charging bull coming at him,

112
00:04:25.945 --> 00:04:27.759
and he throws the switch and the bull stops

113
00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.434
right in front of him.

114
00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:31.833
By the mid-'80's he figured out

115
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:34.543
he didn't need any implanted technologies.

116
00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:36.547
All is you needed to know was how to

117
00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.980
modulate the right frequency.

118
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.230
And the energy density, the concentration of energy,

119
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.668
was one-fiftieth of what the earth naturally produces.

120
00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:48.473
Very small, small energy in the RF range,

121
00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:50.128
in the radio frequency ranges.

122
00:04:50.128 --> 00:04:51.588
Now compare that to what's around us

123
00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:52.699
right at the moment.

124
00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.838
At the moment there's 200 million times more

125
00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:59.004
radio frequency energy around us, in any urban area,

126
00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:02.742
than there is naturally produced by the earth.

127
00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:06.315
So a huge amount, and out of all that background noise,

128
00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:08.191
what he found is,

129
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.795
by hitting a precise window frequency

130
00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:12.789
with very low energy concentrations,

131
00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.842
he would pick that signal out because it was coherent.

132
00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:17.857
Not like nature all over the map.

133
00:05:17.857 --> 00:05:19.234
It was a coherent rhythmic signal

134
00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:21.527
in a very precise frequency.

135
00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:22.967
The brain would pick it out.

136
00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.448
And he could change behavior

137
00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:26.656
from lethargic to highly active.

138
00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:28.171
Back and forth. Back and forth.

139
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:30.145
Like switching on and off a light switch.

140
00:05:30.145 --> 00:05:31.701
<v Voiceover>Let me ask you a question right here.</v>

141
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:33.580
Is that what the subject that was in,

142
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.501
say a short distance of whatever he was utilizing

143
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:39.638
to affect this particular pulse, or is this at large?

144
00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.224
Could he do this on say, larger groups?

145
00:05:42.224 --> 00:05:44.509
<v ->You could do it on an individual basis</v>

146
00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.152
or a very large basis.

147
00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:48.893
In fact if you go back to the work of J.F. Gordon McDonald,

148
00:05:48.893 --> 00:05:51.102
he was a geophysicist at UCLA,

149
00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:53.351
and he was a science advisor to Lyndon Johnson.

150
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.933
He wrote a chapter in a book called Unless Peace Comes.

151
00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:58.835
And the chapter was called How To Wreck Your Environment.

152
00:05:58.835 --> 00:06:01.777
But within that chapter was a section that said,

153
00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:03.528
if we could ever learn how to

154
00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:06.055
electronically stroke the ionosphere,

155
00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:07.986
this layer that begins about 30 miles

156
00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:10.097
above the earth's surface that's electrically charged,

157
00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:11.559
if we could ever figure out how to

158
00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:12.923
electronically stroke it, he said,

159
00:06:12.923 --> 00:06:15.548
to get it to send a signal back to the earth

160
00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:17.831
we could affect the behavior of people

161
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:20.614
over huge geographic areas on a hemispheric basis.

162
00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:22.139
And it wouldn't affect everyone,

163
00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.699
it would affect 70 or 80% of the population

164
00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.417
is what they more or less figured.

165
00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:30.597
But this was a technology that didn't exist in 1969.

166
00:06:30.597 --> 00:06:33.486
In the early '70s, Zbigniew Brezinski referenced

167
00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:36.579
J.F. Gordon's work and said this is a technology

168
00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.414
that will likely emerge.

169
00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:40.679
What has happened with a project that I

170
00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:42.208
wrote a book on some time ago,

171
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:43.786
Angels Don't Play This HAARP,

172
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.419
about the HAARP Project.

173
00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.273
It was designed to do many things.

174
00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:51.449
As a side effect or a deliberate effect, this can happen.

175
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:54.890
The fact is, they generate the right kind of signal,

176
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.074
in the right range to override brain function.

177
00:06:58.074 --> 00:06:59.675
And that you can kind of look at the brain

178
00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:02.606
in sort of this way in terms of predominate brain activity.

179
00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:05.642
One to four hertz or pulses or vibrations per second.

180
00:07:05.642 --> 00:07:07.190
This is where you are in your deepest,

181
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.200
deepest states of sleep.

182
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.712
The next range, approximately four to seven hertz,

183
00:07:11.712 --> 00:07:13.702
this is the theta range.

184
00:07:13.702 --> 00:07:16.110
This is where you are between awake and asleep.

185
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.084
When you're consciously aware of your dreams.

186
00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:19.889
This is where little kids are

187
00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.559
between three and six years old,

188
00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:22.870
why they have trouble distinguishing

189
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.726
reality from imagination,

190
00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:27.051
because of the way the brain works at that time.

191
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:29.878
Little bit further up you have the alpha range.

192
00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:32.640
seven to say 11, 12 hertz, in that range.

193
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.549
This is where you are when you're in the zone.

194
00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:36.842
When you're doing your art, your reading, your research.

195
00:07:36.842 --> 00:07:38.218
When you're really focused.

196
00:07:38.218 --> 00:07:39.680
That's where you want to be.

197
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.258
And then above that is the beta range,

198
00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:42.581
is where people should be when we're

199
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:44.511
actively having this kind of a dialogue.

200
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.626
And then high beta is where you are in your agitated states.

201
00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:50.335
If you think about affecting the brain,

202
00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:54.947
by analogy, similarly to dialing a radio station.

203
00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:57.396
when you dial through the radio station

204
00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:59.508
most of the energy is just static.

205
00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:01.417
You just hear static between the stations.

206
00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:03.902
When you get on station, you get resonance.

207
00:08:03.902 --> 00:08:05.758
Harmony between the transmitter and receiver

208
00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.401
and you get a nice, clear signal.

209
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.632
The same is true in the human body and the human brain.

210
00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:12.840
Whether you look at on an elemental level,

211
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.813
the elements that compose the body

212
00:08:14.813 --> 00:08:17.459
or you take it all the way up to the organs of the body.

213
00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:19.570
You can create modulations,

214
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.933
oscillations that will override the brain's natural rhythms.

215
00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:26.141
The brain will entrain or lock on

216
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:28.466
to that external signal and begin to mirror it.

217
00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.279
<v Voiceover>By putting this coherent signal in.</v>

218
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:33.370
<v ->Right. Coherent meaning rhythmic, not random.</v>

219
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:33.735
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

220
00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:35.955
<v ->So it's not so much the amount of energy,</v>

221
00:08:35.955 --> 00:08:38.579
it's the way the energy is manipulated.

222
00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:40.850
So what they found in military applications,

223
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.104
and there's dozens of source documents that we quote.

224
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:47.026
They found that they could use these external fields

225
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:50.711
for degrading or depleting

226
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:52.385
the ability of an adversary

227
00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:55.009
to say, wage war, or confuse their thoughts enough

228
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:56.641
to where they become--

229
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.219
<v Voiceover>This was actually utilized?</v>

230
00:08:58.219 --> 00:09:00.075
<v ->Yeah, these technologies have been around.</v>

231
00:09:00.075 --> 00:09:02.166
They've been tested over the years.

232
00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:04.363
The question becomes where and when

233
00:09:04.363 --> 00:09:06.432
and under what classifications.

234
00:09:06.432 --> 00:09:08.544
And as we looked at them and we saw over

235
00:09:08.544 --> 00:09:11.925
almost three dozen U.S. patents showing the evolution

236
00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:14.101
of these technologies cited in our work.

237
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.728
This is all material that is in the open literature.

238
00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:19.103
When you trace the history,

239
00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:22.303
you can go back to say, the early '80s even,

240
00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:23.605
where they began to ask for

241
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.556
what's called a dosimetry handbooks.

242
00:09:25.556 --> 00:09:28.148
Dosages of radio frequency necessary to override

243
00:09:28.148 --> 00:09:29.642
various parts of the body,

244
00:09:29.642 --> 00:09:31.636
whether it be the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs.

245
00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:34.772
By '85 the United States Air Force contracted

246
00:09:34.772 --> 00:09:36.841
with the University of Utah and actually put together

247
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:38.932
the radio frequency dosimetry handbook,

248
00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:41.182
which is a big, thick volume that lays it out

249
00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:43.102
so that you can target the heart, the liver, the lungs,

250
00:09:43.102 --> 00:09:45.523
or the brain or any other organ of the body

251
00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:49.000
to debilitate an adversary.

252
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.485
Or to stop their heart and kill 'em for that matter.

253
00:09:51.485 --> 00:09:54.525
Recently you've seen promoted,

254
00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:56.669
in fact it's been every year for five years they announce

255
00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:58.077
it as if it were brand-new,

256
00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:00.701
this Humvee with a dish on the back of it

257
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.749
that's used for riot control purposes.

258
00:10:02.749 --> 00:10:05.021
And the story goes that it'll create the heat sensation

259
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.463
on the surface of the body of about 130 degrees,

260
00:10:07.463 --> 00:10:10.386
which it certainly will do if it's ranged correctly.

261
00:10:10.386 --> 00:10:12.220
If it's ranged for say a half a mile

262
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.108
and someone walks 20 feet in front of it,

263
00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:15.239
they're going to have a much different

264
00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:18.001
experience than 130 degrees on the surface of the skin.

265
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:21.745
But in civil societies, we gave up burning people

266
00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:23.366
at the stake a long time ago,

267
00:10:23.366 --> 00:10:27.366
and now we have a technological application that doesn't

268
00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:30.630
create the same stench of flames affecting tissue,

269
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.723
but has the same dramatic torturing effect.

270
00:10:33.723 --> 00:10:36.901
And this is used for not just foreign adversaries,

271
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:40.176
this was funded also for domestic riot control purposes.

272
00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:42.202
And what they didn't tell the public is,

273
00:10:42.202 --> 00:10:44.933
by changing the wave form, pulse rate,

274
00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:47.098
frequency, or any number of parameters,

275
00:10:47.098 --> 00:10:49.509
you can have a much, much different effect.

276
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:52.506
You can affect the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs.

277
00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:55.567
You can do many, many things with the very same device

278
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:58.447
driven by software and the push of a button.

279
00:10:58.447 --> 00:11:00.697
And it's a question of the intent of the operator.

280
00:11:00.697 --> 00:11:02.510
But you introduce a new piece of hardware,

281
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.185
you have to have the story.

282
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:06.734
And the story for the military is, it's just for heating.

283
00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:08.206
And I believe it's a lie.

284
00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:09.614
Because the technology is there,

285
00:11:09.614 --> 00:11:11.566
and they would apply that technology

286
00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:14.894
if not experimentally as they're doing in the warfronts

287
00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:16.952
that we're engaged in today to see what

288
00:11:16.952 --> 00:11:19.043
and how far they can go with these technologies.

289
00:11:19.043 --> 00:11:21.325
<v Voiceover>These same technologies that</v>

290
00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:25.080
might this go back even to say the days of

291
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.821
royal rife when he was using his quote

292
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:30.989
energy technologies or frequency technologies

293
00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.939
to target a particular bacteria

294
00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:35.486
or organ in the body and help enhance the health of it.

295
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:38.067
Is this not perhaps, is this a more sophistated

296
00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:41.779
but potential or version of that except with

297
00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:43.336
negative applications?

298
00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:46.333
<v ->Absolutely. Energy medicine is where the hope lies.</v>

299
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:49.789
This is where the hope is to move from the chemical models

300
00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:52.114
to the electromagnetic models.

301
00:11:52.114 --> 00:11:54.674
When you think about that transition.

302
00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:55.997
Now you hear a little bit of movement

303
00:11:55.997 --> 00:11:58.364
because everybody talks about electrochemical models.

304
00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:01.212
It's underlying all of the chemistry,

305
00:12:01.212 --> 00:12:03.868
and if you look at how the biological science has evolved,

306
00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:08.230
people that had really good training and talent

307
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.665
in mathematics tend to go to the physics side of life.

308
00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.126
People that couldn't quite get the math,

309
00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:15.057
but were very brilliant tended to move towards

310
00:12:15.057 --> 00:12:16.657
chemistry and the life sciences.

311
00:12:16.657 --> 00:12:18.235
And they kind of parted the waters there,

312
00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:20.678
which is a serious mistake because all chemical

313
00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:24.432
activity has an underlying energetic.

314
00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:27.173
On the physics level you can do things here

315
00:12:27.173 --> 00:12:29.424
that then create changes in the chemistry.

316
00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:32.752
And this is where the disconnect, that I think has been,

317
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.279
if you look at the papers that have been published

318
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:38.063
in the last 10 years, you see these things coming together

319
00:12:38.063 --> 00:12:40.548
as people understand that the underlying energetic

320
00:12:40.548 --> 00:12:44.655
exchanges have an impact on molecules and chemicals

321
00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:47.673
but then manifest themselves in health maladies.

322
00:12:47.673 --> 00:12:50.692
So consequently if you think about how Westerners

323
00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:52.857
approach medicine, kind of look from the outside in,

324
00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:54.382
you look at the physical body,

325
00:12:54.382 --> 00:12:55.524
you might do some blood tests,

326
00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:56.686
you might some imaging,

327
00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:58.403
but we don't do much more than that.

328
00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.747
If you think about Eastern medicine,

329
00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:01.838
it starts from an energetic level and works outward.

330
00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:03.512
Takes a little longer.

331
00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:05.720
Things like acupuncture that are quite controversial

332
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.037
in the past have been quantified.

333
00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:11.544
There's a device that we demonstrate

334
00:13:11.544 --> 00:13:14.242
where you can actually locate the points by

335
00:13:14.242 --> 00:13:16.216
measuring skin resistance differentials

336
00:13:16.216 --> 00:13:17.538
on the surface of the skin.

337
00:13:17.538 --> 00:13:18.955
You find all the acupuncture points.

338
00:13:18.955 --> 00:13:19.951
<v Voiceover>Well even HMO's are now</v>

339
00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:21.402
supporting payment of acupuncture

340
00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:22.194
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

341
00:13:22.194 --> 00:13:23.092
<v Voiceover>And some of these--</v>

342
00:13:23.092 --> 00:13:24.366
<v ->Because it works.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

343
00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:26.386
<v ->And it works profoundly without the chemicals</v>

344
00:13:26.386 --> 00:13:29.757
that can damage a liver, and kidneys,

345
00:13:29.757 --> 00:13:31.868
and the rest of our physiology.

346
00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:34.055
<v Voiceover>So it's not, the technology</v>

347
00:13:34.055 --> 00:13:35.815
itself certainly is not evil.

348
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.679
<v ->No.</v>

349
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:38.471
<v Voiceover>It is simply being used in ways</v>

350
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:40.369
that are perhaps not for the highest and best

351
00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:41.713
good of all at times.

352
00:13:41.713 --> 00:13:44.113
Just to wrap up that element of it,

353
00:13:44.113 --> 00:13:47.313
how does one even know if these technologies

354
00:13:47.313 --> 00:13:49.286
are being used or if they're being subject

355
00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:50.630
to these technologies?

356
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.656
<v ->You don't. That's the problem.</v>

357
00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:53.883
There's no regulation.

358
00:13:53.883 --> 00:13:56.272
There's no way to really tell as an individual.

359
00:13:56.272 --> 00:13:58.736
You would just assume it was you.

360
00:13:58.736 --> 00:14:00.496
<v Voiceover>Are there some signatures</v>

361
00:14:00.496 --> 00:14:03.546
in how you would behave or feel or anything like that?

362
00:14:03.546 --> 00:14:05.637
<v ->Well, you'd feel obviously out of character.</v>

363
00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:09.114
But again, people go through periods where they do that.

364
00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.991
You might feel confused.

365
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:12.570
Some people would probably think

366
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.660
they were losing mental faculties,

367
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.007
that it was themselves.

368
00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:18.970
Nobody, very few would ever suggest

369
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.248
that it's something else.

370
00:14:20.248 --> 00:14:22.828
Now we hear from people all the time

371
00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:25.133
that assert that military is doing this to 'em,

372
00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:27.597
and most of those folks are having other problems.

373
00:14:27.597 --> 00:14:30.178
But I am sure that just based on the fact that

374
00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:32.077
our government's history in this area,

375
00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:34.562
and them being caught (laughs) a number of times

376
00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:37.602
in this area, these experiments go on.

377
00:14:37.602 --> 00:14:39.020
And the fact is, if it doesn't happen within

378
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.482
the boundaries of the United States,

379
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:41.858
it happens somewhere else

380
00:14:41.858 --> 00:14:43.713
where they feel the Constitution doesn't apply.

381
00:14:43.713 --> 00:14:45.473
<v Voiceover>So is it a blurry line between</v>

382
00:14:45.473 --> 00:14:48.407
experimenting on, you said a half a million people

383
00:14:48.407 --> 00:14:50.604
over the course of the last few decades,

384
00:14:50.604 --> 00:14:52.652
and who might have been involved in the military

385
00:14:52.652 --> 00:14:54.667
or something feeling they had an empirical right

386
00:14:54.667 --> 00:14:56.971
because these were employees of sorts

387
00:14:56.971 --> 00:15:00.203
or groups that they felt they had an advantage over.

388
00:15:00.203 --> 00:15:03.467
Is it a fuzzy line to determining who else is going

389
00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:04.704
to be subject to it?

390
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:07.445
<v ->Oh, ultimately when you start looking at all</v>

391
00:15:07.445 --> 00:15:10.186
these technologies, who are the targets?

392
00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:12.778
The targets are obviously declared adversaries.

393
00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.389
But when you think about it,

394
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:17.151
and again going back to this kind of technology evolving,

395
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.562
the temptation of political leaders

396
00:15:19.562 --> 00:15:21.610
is to get their views across,

397
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.370
to get their issues pushed forward.

398
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.692
Not because they don't believe in them.

399
00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:25.716
Quite the contrary.

400
00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.433
They believe vigorously in them.

401
00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:29.129
Would they use technology?

402
00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:32.052
I think so. Zbigniew Brzezinski thinks so.

403
00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:33.353
And he's said so.

404
00:15:33.353 --> 00:15:36.414
The fact is, when you think about the envasiveness

405
00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:38.579
of this technology, think about the basic values

406
00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:40.062
Americans hold in common.

407
00:15:40.062 --> 00:15:41.694
Think about the very first amendment.

408
00:15:41.694 --> 00:15:43.614
Freedom of speech, assembly, religion,

409
00:15:43.614 --> 00:15:45.896
are all predicated on one idea.

410
00:15:45.896 --> 00:15:47.752
Freedom to think.

411
00:15:47.752 --> 00:15:49.821
The fact that we have technology that can interfere

412
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:54.109
with that today demands regulation as a fundamental

413
00:15:54.109 --> 00:15:55.997
to the American character.

414
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.386
<v Voiceover>Let's take it a step further.</v>

415
00:15:58.386 --> 00:16:01.682
These technologies can also be used in a positive way

416
00:16:01.682 --> 00:16:03.868
to enhance our brain's functioning.

417
00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:05.746
And let's look at some of the positive applications.

418
00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:08.247
<v ->This is the most important. Absolutely.</v>

419
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:09.689
And in the fact that the government withholds

420
00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:11.876
so much data that could be useful to the life sciences

421
00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:14.148
has not stopped advances from being made.

422
00:16:14.148 --> 00:16:17.166
A good example is neuro biofeedback

423
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:19.076
or brain biofeedback used for treating

424
00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:21.305
ADD, attention deficit disorder children,

425
00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:23.737
hyperactive kids as well, stroke victims,

426
00:16:23.737 --> 00:16:25.507
addictive behaviors.

427
00:16:25.507 --> 00:16:28.014
And what they use is an 8 or 16 channel EEG,

428
00:16:28.014 --> 00:16:31.661
it's kind of messy, gooey stuff all over your head.

429
00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:32.931
Well they've got new ones now

430
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:34.797
that are nice, little helmets that you can wear.

431
00:16:34.797 --> 00:16:36.738
You look at a computer screen and in real time

432
00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:38.466
you might see like for a little kid,

433
00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:40.760
a bouncing ball or a guy running a foot race.

434
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.106
And the idea is to get the guy to win the race.

435
00:16:43.106 --> 00:16:44.589
And what they're really doing is training

436
00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:47.820
their own brains to fall into that range,

437
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.159
that ideal range of learning.

438
00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:52.460
And so what happens,

439
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.177
in Minneapolis school district they did this

440
00:16:54.177 --> 00:16:55.671
with a charter school,

441
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:56.876
and they took all the kids in there,

442
00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:59.084
they were all on Ritalin and psychoactive drugs.

443
00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:01.356
They went through 30 to 40 one-hour sessions

444
00:17:01.356 --> 00:17:04.491
of this kind of training, put the hardware aside,

445
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.910
and they were off.

446
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.267
80% of those kids were off of those drugs

447
00:17:08.267 --> 00:17:09.909
by the end of the first year,

448
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:11.936
integrated back into regular ed programs.

449
00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:13.814
You can't say enough about what

450
00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:15.306
that did for those children.

451
00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:17.898
But think about it from everyone's standpoint.

452
00:17:17.898 --> 00:17:19.613
It cost two or three or four times

453
00:17:19.613 --> 00:17:21.555
more per year, every year,

454
00:17:21.555 --> 00:17:23.645
to educate those kids otherwise

455
00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:25.597
in special education programs.

456
00:17:25.597 --> 00:17:28.808
If you can avoid that, this is a tremendous step

457
00:17:28.808 --> 00:17:30.823
in the right direction, and it's just one.

458
00:17:30.823 --> 00:17:33.681
Other areas where this technology has been advanced

459
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:35.355
is light and sound devices.

460
00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:37.350
These ideas that create a flickering light

461
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.164
that the brain entrains to.

462
00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:41.734
And people go, "Well how can a flickering light do that?"

463
00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:43.782
Do you remember a few years ago in Japan

464
00:17:43.782 --> 00:17:45.937
when 700 kids went to the hospital

465
00:17:45.937 --> 00:17:47.516
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->with epileptic seizures?</v>

466
00:17:47.516 --> 00:17:49.285
From watching a cartoon?

467
00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:51.601
Now it wasn't the energy concentration,

468
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:53.253
because it's quite light.

469
00:17:53.253 --> 00:17:55.065
You put your hand up next to a color television set,

470
00:17:55.065 --> 00:17:56.408
you can feel static.

471
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.681
You get back just an inch or two and it's gone.

472
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:01.241
Well 10 feet away they say it's perfectly safe.

473
00:18:01.241 --> 00:18:04.068
It was the flicker rate. The frequency.

474
00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:06.434
That window frequency of coherent energy

475
00:18:06.434 --> 00:18:09.197
that was sufficient to cause that chemical cascade

476
00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:11.794
in those 700 kids that led to epileptic seizures.

477
00:18:11.794 --> 00:18:14.066
Now flickering light has been shown

478
00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:16.881
to do many things in terms of entrainment.

479
00:18:16.881 --> 00:18:18.822
You can entrain to levels that get you

480
00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:20.967
into those deep states of meditative states.

481
00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.633
You can entrain for relaxation for sleep.

482
00:18:23.633 --> 00:18:25.360
You can entrain to energize

483
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.291
when you're a little bit lethargic.

484
00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:29.915
Or you can entrain for specific learning applications.

485
00:18:29.915 --> 00:18:31.910
And so these technologies are out there.

486
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.811
When you think about electro medicine as a concept,

487
00:18:34.811 --> 00:18:37.391
electro acupuncture, electro laser acupuncture's

488
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:39.248
been developed and licensed in Europe.

489
00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:40.964
Meeting challenges in Finland

490
00:18:40.964 --> 00:18:42.383
all the way to the highest court.

491
00:18:42.383 --> 00:18:44.480
A good friend of mine, Reijo Mäkelä

492
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.753
before he passed away took on that challenge.

493
00:18:46.753 --> 00:18:48.981
He treated 16,000 people with a method of

494
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:50.955
electro laser acupuncture.

495
00:18:50.955 --> 00:18:53.141
He was challenged by the medical authorities in Finland,

496
00:18:53.141 --> 00:18:55.434
all they way to their high courts, and he won.

497
00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:57.462
There are 15 trained clinicians there

498
00:18:57.462 --> 00:18:59.668
providing this technology and expanding it.

499
00:18:59.668 --> 00:19:02.496
These are the things that really offer

500
00:19:02.496 --> 00:19:05.397
not the pandora's box of the military,

501
00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:08.511
but the real hope for many, many people.

502
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:11.039
When you think about stroke victim's recovery,

503
00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.481
and being able to get back some of those faculties.

504
00:19:13.481 --> 00:19:15.828
I mean all of us have met people or known people

505
00:19:15.828 --> 00:19:17.353
who've lived any length of all

506
00:19:17.353 --> 00:19:19.050
that could use this technology.

507
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.580
And the fact is, it's not in the mainstream.

508
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.000
Only a few school districts after being around for now

509
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.549
for 20 years, some of this stuff, are integrating it.

510
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:30.483
Some of the medicine that you're seeing now

511
00:19:30.483 --> 00:19:32.242
in terms of acupuncture moving to some

512
00:19:32.242 --> 00:19:34.013
of these other areas is just now starting

513
00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:35.358
to get into the mainstream,

514
00:19:35.358 --> 00:19:37.789
although it's been around now for a couple of decades.

515
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:39.368
Takes time.

516
00:19:39.368 --> 00:19:41.118
The biggest loss, the biggest criminal element

517
00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:43.804
is the idea that all the millions,

518
00:19:43.804 --> 00:19:46.312
all the billions that we spend in military research

519
00:19:46.312 --> 00:19:48.061
is withheld from the public.

520
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.514
For the health advantages that might be offered

521
00:19:50.514 --> 00:19:53.276
by the understanding of these types of technologies.

522
00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.281
<v Voiceover>And sound technology,</v>

523
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:56.690
you were talking about flickering lights.

524
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.409
There are incredible advancements in sound technology.

525
00:19:59.409 --> 00:20:01.990
And one that I've had a little bit of exposure to,

526
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.964
that I think is just fabulous and simple,

527
00:20:03.964 --> 00:20:05.265
is the Hemi-Sync.

528
00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:07.463
<v ->Yeah, Hemi-Sync was developed by Bob Monroe,</v>

529
00:20:07.463 --> 00:20:08.998
and it's one of those technologies

530
00:20:08.998 --> 00:20:10.096
we are pretty excited about,

531
00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:12.293
we've been excited about for a long time.

532
00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:14.597
And what it creates is whole brain coherence,

533
00:20:14.597 --> 00:20:17.105
where the whole brain actually resonates

534
00:20:17.105 --> 00:20:18.587
to that input signal.

535
00:20:18.587 --> 00:20:20.582
And here's the thing about hearing.

536
00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:22.255
If you're using sound it's a little tough,

537
00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:23.835
'cause to get those low frequencies,

538
00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:25.648
extremely low frequency signals,

539
00:20:25.648 --> 00:20:27.364
we don't hear that low.

540
00:20:27.364 --> 00:20:29.136
So what Monroe figured out is that

541
00:20:29.136 --> 00:20:31.663
by sending a signal, say in one ear at say,

542
00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:34.192
16,000 hertz or vibrations per second,

543
00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.399
and one in and say 16,007,

544
00:20:36.399 --> 00:20:39.022
they cancel and leaves a beat frequency of seven

545
00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:41.881
that the brain locks onto, and as it locks onto it,

546
00:20:41.881 --> 00:20:45.966
both hemispheres, energy distribution is about even.

547
00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:47.716
In other words, if you looked at it,

548
00:20:47.716 --> 00:20:49.550
just a normal brain activity,

549
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.918
you'd see usually a lot of energy concentrated

550
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.753
in one area of the brain on one side,

551
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.558
and the other kind of dead, or vice versa.

552
00:20:56.558 --> 00:20:57.954
And there's this big argument,

553
00:20:57.954 --> 00:20:59.139
right brain, left brain,

554
00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:00.601
one's creative, one's analytical,

555
00:21:00.601 --> 00:21:02.018
and which one's more important.

556
00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:04.014
They're both important and meant to work together.

557
00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:07.063
What Hemi-Sync does is create an entrainment

558
00:21:07.063 --> 00:21:09.890
of both hemispheres where they both are working together.

559
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.929
And then they have specific CDs that are designed

560
00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:14.700
to affect different things.

561
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.834
So whether it's a behavior modification,

562
00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:19.799
they use in some cases just straight tones,

563
00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:22.349
other cases they use tones with suggestion.

564
00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:25.212
And the difference is, their suggestions are audible.

565
00:21:25.212 --> 00:21:28.143
You can hear them all, they're not like subliminals,

566
00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:29.721
which can be quite dangerous.

567
00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.384
And the reason subliminals can be dangerous

568
00:21:31.384 --> 00:21:33.551
is word symbols are very, very powerful.

569
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:35.502
If I say "dog" for instance,

570
00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:37.006
some people feel real good about it.

571
00:21:37.006 --> 00:21:38.702
Others get gripped with fear because of

572
00:21:38.702 --> 00:21:40.536
experiences they've had with animals.

573
00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:42.413
So when you listen to subliminals

574
00:21:42.413 --> 00:21:43.790
and you don't know what's being said,

575
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.859
remember these are bypassing the conscious,

576
00:21:45.859 --> 00:21:47.800
so if they conflict with your value system,

577
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.582
conflicts and value systems at the sub-conscious

578
00:21:50.582 --> 00:21:53.442
levels are the root of many forms of psychosis.

579
00:21:53.442 --> 00:21:55.339
So you want to know what's being put in.

580
00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:57.783
So Hemi-Sync I like because if they use words

581
00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:59.104
and in some they do,

582
00:21:59.104 --> 00:22:01.356
you know exactly what words are going to be used.

583
00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:03.008
They line up with your value systems

584
00:22:03.008 --> 00:22:04.214
or you don't use them.

585
00:22:04.214 --> 00:22:05.836
<v Voiceover>The one I'm particularly fond of</v>

586
00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:07.584
that I used to sit down and write a script

587
00:22:07.584 --> 00:22:11.478
and do my research through my iPod little headset,

588
00:22:11.478 --> 00:22:15.830
is one that has no words in it and you don't

589
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.883
really hear the tone.

590
00:22:16.883 --> 00:22:19.112
It's more just sounds like really pretty music.

591
00:22:19.112 --> 00:22:19.966
<v ->Right.</v>

592
00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:21.065
<v Voiceover>Very pleasant music,</v>

593
00:22:21.065 --> 00:22:23.410
except you feel incredibly uplifted and optimistic.

594
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.263
<v ->Right.</v>

595
00:22:24.263 --> 00:22:26.077
<v Voiceover>And your brain is incredibly focused.</v>

596
00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:28.008
<v ->Yeah, and these are what they're exactly designed to do.</v>

597
00:22:28.008 --> 00:22:29.842
There are several designed for concentration

598
00:22:29.842 --> 00:22:31.463
for those kinds of applications.

599
00:22:31.463 --> 00:22:34.023
There's some designed for memory, relaxation,

600
00:22:34.023 --> 00:22:35.954
getting rid of bad habits, losing weight,

601
00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.829
increasing sex drive, it goes on and on and on.

602
00:22:37.829 --> 00:22:40.100
They have lots of material out there.

603
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.263
And they're cheap.

604
00:22:41.263 --> 00:22:42.446
That's the beauty of it.

605
00:22:42.446 --> 00:22:43.649
It's not like you have to invest hundreds

606
00:22:43.649 --> 00:22:45.174
and hundreds of dollars.

607
00:22:45.174 --> 00:22:46.635
These are things that cost 20 bucks

608
00:22:46.635 --> 00:22:49.430
and a CD lasts as long as the CD lasts,

609
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.559
and there you are.

610
00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.255
You have something that you can apply

611
00:22:52.255 --> 00:22:55.787
to your specific need as an individual making the choice,

612
00:22:55.787 --> 00:22:57.664
not having it imposed upon you.

613
00:22:57.664 --> 00:23:00.617
And then utilize it to enhance your own performance,

614
00:23:00.617 --> 00:23:03.360
And in a technological age, we need more of that.

615
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.863
And the nice thing about it is,

616
00:23:04.863 --> 00:23:07.028
the more you use these technologies,

617
00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:09.514
the brain lays down its own pathways,

618
00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:12.105
and so your tendency is on a more

619
00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:13.854
frequent basis you do it naturally.

620
00:23:13.854 --> 00:23:15.519
With little kids you see a lot more balance

621
00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:17.801
as we bring them into so-called education.

622
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:20.788
We see the shift where we treat little girls one way

623
00:23:20.788 --> 00:23:22.121
and little boys another way,

624
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:24.372
and as a consequence one brain gets developed,

625
00:23:24.372 --> 00:23:26.409
one side of the brain versus the other.

626
00:23:26.409 --> 00:23:28.040
Today a little less of that 'cause we kind of

627
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.937
mess 'em up equally nowadays (laughs).

628
00:23:29.937 --> 00:23:30.828
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

629
00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:32.262
<v ->But the point is, by the end of high school,</v>

630
00:23:32.262 --> 00:23:34.235
there's very little brain coherence with

631
00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:36.016
both hemispheres working together.

632
00:23:36.016 --> 00:23:38.086
Very rarely do you see that.

633
00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:40.102
And this is something that we need more of.

634
00:23:40.102 --> 00:23:41.733
Things that could be easily integrated

635
00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:43.355
into a public education,

636
00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.606
but could most certainly be integrated privately.

637
00:23:45.606 --> 00:23:47.183
The thing about public education,

638
00:23:47.183 --> 00:23:48.879
that's extremely important,

639
00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:51.044
is as technologies evolve,

640
00:23:51.044 --> 00:23:53.199
the way this is headed and the direction

641
00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:54.800
in which military sees it going,

642
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.870
is you'll actually be able to transfer full memory sets.

643
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.282
They believe they're going to be able to model the brain

644
00:24:00.282 --> 00:24:02.019
in the next 10 to 15 years,

645
00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:03.599
where if you want to learn a language,

646
00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:05.209
instead of spending years doing it,

647
00:24:05.209 --> 00:24:06.617
you could download that language

648
00:24:06.617 --> 00:24:08.227
and have it in a few hours.

649
00:24:08.227 --> 00:24:10.734
Now that is not science fiction today.

650
00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:14.382
That is the leading direction of many researchers today.

651
00:24:14.382 --> 00:24:16.611
<v Voiceover>How does that change the educational system?</v>

652
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:17.581
<v ->Very important.</v>

653
00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.182
Because remember education in the United States

654
00:24:19.182 --> 00:24:22.755
is compulsory, required in most states until you're 16.

655
00:24:22.755 --> 00:24:25.847
Parents don't set the curriculum, government does.

656
00:24:25.847 --> 00:24:29.101
For learning language was kind of neutral, that's one thing.

657
00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:31.352
Or mathematics, which is kind of neutral.

658
00:24:31.352 --> 00:24:33.763
What about social studies?

659
00:24:33.763 --> 00:24:35.764
What about social values?

660
00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:36.552
What's normal?

661
00:24:36.552 --> 00:24:38.035
What's right? What's wrong?

662
00:24:38.035 --> 00:24:39.273
Who's going to decide that?

663
00:24:39.273 --> 00:24:41.801
And the problem is, as these systems evolve,

664
00:24:41.801 --> 00:24:44.584
and in an environment of compulsory education,

665
00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:46.514
you don't get a choice.

666
00:24:46.514 --> 00:24:50.067
You get a scripted menu of someone else's system.

667
00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:52.040
And is that appropriate?

668
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.736
Who should set values for children?

669
00:24:53.736 --> 00:24:55.688
Parents or governmental agencies?

670
00:24:55.688 --> 00:24:57.586
I don't care if you're a liberal or a conservative,

671
00:24:57.586 --> 00:24:59.676
everyone agrees it's parents.

672
00:24:59.676 --> 00:25:02.972
And those that don't are sorely, sorely mistaken.

673
00:25:02.972 --> 00:25:06.204
The fact of the matter is, as the technologies evolve,

674
00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:08.274
we need more choice in education

675
00:25:08.274 --> 00:25:10.802
for parents to exercise where their kids

676
00:25:10.802 --> 00:25:13.307
eventually get their downloads.

677
00:25:13.307 --> 00:25:16.049
And it's going to be this generation that decides.

678
00:25:16.049 --> 00:25:18.747
And that means we have to begin to educate ourselves

679
00:25:18.747 --> 00:25:22.459
as the technologies evolve, not once they arrive.

680
00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:24.059
And I think that's the challenge.

681
00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:25.660
For us, for the next five years,

682
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.686
this area is so important,

683
00:25:27.686 --> 00:25:31.024
because we know it takes about 20 to 25 years

684
00:25:31.024 --> 00:25:34.853
to migrate out of those military industrial complex

685
00:25:34.853 --> 00:25:36.741
into the private sector.

686
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:39.824
So we right now have time to make that difference.

687
00:25:39.824 --> 00:25:42.779
And I think it's a wonderful challenge,

688
00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:44.932
because if we can look at these technologies

689
00:25:44.932 --> 00:25:47.833
from our own individual value set

690
00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:50.767
and expand what we're capable of as human beings,

691
00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:54.105
great, great things are possible for humanity.

692
00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:56.964
We were designed to use the whole brain.

693
00:25:56.964 --> 00:25:59.331
Now we have technologies that can help us get there.

694
00:25:59.331 --> 00:26:01.394
And we should do that.

695
00:26:06.339 --> 00:26:07.971
<v Voiceover>If you're interested in these exotic</v>

696
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:09.828
and little-known technologies,

697
00:26:09.828 --> 00:26:12.290
you'll likely find the interview with Jerry E. Smith

698
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.730
quite an eye-opener.

699
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.909
Meanwhile, visit Dr. Begich's site for more information.

700
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:20.573
Until next time, thanks for watching.
