00:00:00.889 --> 00:00:03.168
<v ->John Anthony West and Robert Schoch</v>

2
00:00:03.168 --> 00:00:05.289
shocked the world in the 1990s

3
00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:07.129
when they revealed that their research

4
00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.889
on the Sphinx showed erosion due to rainfall

5
00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.748
in what is now an almost totally arid land.

6
00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:15.408
The implications were vast, because this meant

7
00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:17.838
that the Sphinx would be many thousands of years

8
00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:20.065
older than what Egyptologists had believed.

9
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.685
Needless to say, the mainstream field of

10
00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.366
archaeology has not embraced the

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.226
work of these two remarkable men,

12
00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.646
because it would mean admitting

13
00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:30.205
that the Egyptian civilization was far more

14
00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.825
sophisticated than we can comprehend, which is

15
00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:36.436
the emphasis of my conversation with John Anthony West.

16
00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:41.436
(mysterious music)

17
00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:47.004
So, here we are at this incredible conference.

18
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.565
Every speaker has something valuable to add to this subject.

19
00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:52.984
I'm hearing a theme developing this year

20
00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:55.064
that wasn't here as much last year,

21
00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:57.164
and that is the theme of consciousness

22
00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:59.144
and the remembrance of lost knowledge.

23
00:00:59.144 --> 00:01:01.804
You spoke very eloquently about this.

24
00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:03.925
Can you tell us how it is we could have been,

25
00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:06.524
up to this point, so unaware, of the things

26
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.564
we're just now starting to remember?

27
00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:10.424
<v ->Well, the knowledge has been lost</v>

28
00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:13.884
in large part because, let's put it this way,

29
00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:16.064
the knowledge has not been recovered

30
00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:18.964
or is only now being recovered because

31
00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:22.183
our science is only now getting to the point

32
00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:26.354
where we can understand that the ancients had

33
00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:28.979
parallel science equally advanced

34
00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.418
but expressed very differently through

35
00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:34.058
myth and symbol, rather than through mathematics.

36
00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:36.238
And there are huge advantages to a

37
00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:40.178
symbolic and mythological expression

38
00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:43.798
of science actually, and that is that

39
00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:45.958
everybody can understand it, at his or her

40
00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:50.218
own level, whereas when its all mathematics,

41
00:01:50.218 --> 00:01:53.118
virtually everybody but the mathematicians

42
00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:54.958
and the cosmologists are lost,

43
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.697
and then it has to be reexplained

44
00:01:56.697 --> 00:02:00.478
to the great mass of people who don't

45
00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:01.837
actually want to know because they're

46
00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:03.478
all busy watching American Idol.

47
00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:09.778
So, it's only in the last, put it this way,

48
00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:12.517
it's not the whole notion that

49
00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:15.036
advanced civilizations existed in the past,

50
00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:19.787
has never been entirely lost, but since the rise

51
00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:22.445
of modern science, let's say since 1750 or so,

52
00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.945
it's definitely been pushed under the rug

53
00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.545
as what I like to call the church of progress,

54
00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:30.925
has taken over and become the ruling church

55
00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.105
virtually all around the world,

56
00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:35.605
virtually every educational system

57
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.385
is based upon church of progress

58
00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:41.845
assumptions and chief, you might say

59
00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:44.205
the principal dogma of that church,

60
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.324
is that we are the most advanced beings

61
00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:48.725
that have ever inhabited the planet.

62
00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.445
So, anything that comes along that

63
00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:54.365
seriously challenges that dogma

64
00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:57.904
is treated basically the same way

65
00:02:57.904 --> 00:02:59.665
the church of Rome treated heretics,

66
00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:01.464
except it's no longer politically

67
00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:02.965
correct to burn us at the stake.

68
00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.205
<v Woman>Or feed us to lions.</v>

69
00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:08.725
<v ->Or feed us to lions, true, but they would if they could.</v>

70
00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.905
<v ->I have a question, and this is</v>

71
00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:13.345
your big, fat opinion, okay, and that is

72
00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:14.864
is there a certain amount of symmetry

73
00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:16.405
to that, when you look at the procession,

74
00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:20.145
we look at ages of awakening, is there some

75
00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:22.892
logic that at that time, through the last

76
00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:24.573
couple thousand years, information has been

77
00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:27.752
particularly repressed because maybe

78
00:03:27.752 --> 00:03:29.613
the masses weren't ready to go there yet,

79
00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:32.012
the frequencies weren't such for us to take that ride,

80
00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:36.213
or was it deliberate and based on ego on some level?

81
00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:37.753
<v ->Oh, I don't think it was deliberate,</v>

82
00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:40.533
necessarily, but I do think that we're

83
00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.262
starting to understand procession,

84
00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:44.282
let's say the relationship between

85
00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:46.502
the Yuga cycle, what Plato called

86
00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:49.741
the Great Year of successive gold and silver,

87
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:54.741
bronze, iron ages, the gold age being the

88
00:03:54.762 --> 00:03:57.582
mythical golden age of all of the myths and legends,

89
00:03:57.582 --> 00:03:59.922
and the iron age rarely called that,

90
00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:01.902
except in technological terms,

91
00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.322
which is supposed to be an advance,

92
00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:05.542
but actually from a spiritual and metaphysical

93
00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:08.202
point of view, it represents a dark age.

94
00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:12.631
So, let's say in Europe, but it's more or less global,

95
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:15.690
it's just more pronounced perhaps in Europe than elsewhere,

96
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.071
the Dark Age is really pretty dark

97
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:21.731
when you get to about the 6th-7th centuries A.D.,

98
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:26.051
and there's not much left, it's analogous to

99
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:30.171
the, I like to think it's analogous to the

100
00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:32.971
cycle we're so familiar with, of winter,

101
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:36.211
spring, summer, autumn, winter, etc.

102
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.191
In the winter, there's not much you can do,

103
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.331
particularly if you like in upstate New York like me.

104
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.151
Now in Florida or California, it's not so bad.

105
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:49.871
But the seeds, nothing will grow

106
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.571
in the winter, at least in a lot of places,

107
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.411
and if anything is going to grow,

108
00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:58.810
it has to be kept, it has to be concealed

109
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.251
somewhere or anyway, let's say,

110
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:03.231
hidden from the ravages of the weather,

111
00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:06.490
and this actually is what, if you stop and think about it,

112
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.991
more or less the function of the monasteries

113
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.551
in Christianity and the monasteries elsewhere,

114
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:16.490
the ashrams in India, temples in Japan, and so on,

115
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.671
and if they're seen as preservers of wisdom,

116
00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:22.531
it's a kind of a good, interesting way to look

117
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.771
at this whole cycle, and then we come out

118
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:28.011
of it at least scientifically, if not spiritually.

119
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:30.371
Strangely enough, we're at a very strange

120
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:34.451
juncture at the moment where, you might say,

121
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.451
from the philosophical and spiritual point of view,

122
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.311
we're at absolutely the low point,

123
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.361
we're much worse off than 6th century

124
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:44.170
monks in their monasteries where,

125
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.550
at the same time, we have this terrifically

126
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.550
advanced intelligent but misdirected science.

127
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.249
Let's face it, 95% or 99% of science is

128
00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.169
devoted to things that are either

129
00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.030
frivolous or downright destructive.

130
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.250
One of the possible signs of real hope

131
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.870
is that something happens, and I don't know what,

132
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.130
maybe, actually I'd like to think that

133
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.799
I and my colleagues here and plenty

134
00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:14.539
of others being part of it, that somewhere

135
00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.219
along the line, this has a resonance

136
00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.659
and at least shakes some people loose

137
00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.919
and they start thinking in other terms

138
00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.399
and if that creative energy, which is a fact,

139
00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:31.019
it takes an enormous amount of intelligence

140
00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.319
to produce a bobblehead doll, it's just who needs it.

141
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.279
<v Woman>And make it a bestselling</v>

142
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.209
commercial item during the holiday season.

143
00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:41.999
<v ->Well, of course but that's the whole idea.</v>

144
00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.219
<v Woman>That takes real genius.</v>

145
00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.558
<v ->Actually, that's one of the big problems</v>

146
00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:46.019
with contemporary science, I mean,

147
00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.418
what isn't devoted to designing

148
00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:50.539
weapons of mass destruction is

149
00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.819
designed for no other reason than to make money.

150
00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.399
That's the, let's say, of the dogma

151
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.839
of the the church of progress is that

152
00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.179
we're the most advanced beings,

153
00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:03.119
its modus operandi is entirely based

154
00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:05.639
upon money, and so most creative and

155
00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.198
scientific thought is devoted toward

156
00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:10.898
precisely making more money out of

157
00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:12.198
something or another, no matter what

158
00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.778
the something or another is worth.

159
00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:18.118
But that said, it's only in the last

160
00:07:18.118 --> 00:07:20.518
hundred years or so that our science

161
00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:22.898
has got to the point where its capable of

162
00:07:22.898 --> 00:07:25.557
understanding what the ancients actually did know.

163
00:07:25.557 --> 00:07:28.978
Really, there are only a few groundbreaking books,

164
00:07:28.978 --> 00:07:31.278
Hamlet's Mill back in the late '60s,

165
00:07:31.278 --> 00:07:35.158
Schwaller de Lubicz 's own massive magisterial

166
00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:37.695
reinterpretation of Egypt, which is unfortunately,

167
00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:41.436
it's now published in English and it's actually

168
00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:44.375
a wonderful translation, but it's pretty impenetrable,

169
00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:46.566
it's not easy reading, nor is Hamlet's Mill.

170
00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.846
<v Woman>The name of it again?</v>

171
00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:50.076
<v ->Well, my book, The Serpent in the Sky,</v>

172
00:07:50.076 --> 00:07:52.515
is basically an in-depth introduction

173
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:54.436
to Schwaller de Lubicz's work,

174
00:07:54.436 --> 00:07:56.536
which in English is called The Temple of Man.

175
00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:59.236
It's a massive volume, but this is daunting.

176
00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:03.465
Even here at CPAK we see a lot of

177
00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.725
really brainy guys up there talking,

178
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:10.725
but some of it is not really that easy to understand.

179
00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:12.208
I mean, you're not going to tear

180
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:15.228
anyone away from American Idol

181
00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:18.528
to listen to John Deering and his astrophysics.

182
00:08:18.528 --> 00:08:23.188
That said, the possibility is there now,

183
00:08:23.188 --> 00:08:26.067
and in the last two decades, a lot of work

184
00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:28.787
has come out implementing in many ways

185
00:08:28.787 --> 00:08:31.427
this whole notion of advanced civilization,

186
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.048
so you can now approach it from all sorts

187
00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:35.669
of different points of view and some of it

188
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.128
is, you might say, user friendly,

189
00:08:39.128 --> 00:08:40.988
in the sense that a certain amount of it

190
00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:44.877
is comprehensible to ordinary people

191
00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:48.437
who don't necessarily even have a,

192
00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:51.477
they don't even know that they're interested in this,

193
00:08:51.477 --> 00:08:54.776
or a scientific background, but they don't

194
00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:56.457
even know they're interested until its on

195
00:08:56.457 --> 00:09:00.377
and actually that's one of the reasons why

196
00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:04.457
our Sphinx, our geological work on the Sphinx, is as

197
00:09:04.457 --> 00:09:07.417
important as it is, is it's immediately graspable.

198
00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:09.577
Teachers show the video Mystery of the Sphinx

199
00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:13.237
to 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade classes,

200
00:09:13.237 --> 00:09:14.877
and the kids understand it fine.

201
00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:17.557
And then, they're hooked, as it were.

202
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.237
Once you're bitten -

203
00:09:19.237 --> 00:09:20.237
<v Woman>Once you can see the</v>

204
00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:22.137
magic for yourself, a little bit -

205
00:09:22.137 --> 00:09:25.016
<v ->And then, it's up to individuals to</v>

206
00:09:25.016 --> 00:09:27.791
pursue it or not pursue it, as the case may be.

207
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.712
But, in order to make any real change

208
00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:35.652
in the pell mell, downhill spiral

209
00:09:35.652 --> 00:09:40.132
of this crazy civilization, an awful lot of people

210
00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.731
have to suddenly get interested,

211
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:44.412
and quite suddenly decide that their

212
00:09:44.412 --> 00:09:47.412
creative energies and their interests are

213
00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:51.072
drastically and wrongly directed.

214
00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:54.451
And if that happens, maybe something good happens.

215
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:56.212
Maybe personally, I'm pessimistic about that.

216
00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:57.771
<v Woman>Well, I have faith.</v>

217
00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:59.032
Maybe it's because I'm an optimist,

218
00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.891
but you personally make it interesting.

219
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.770
Not only do you inject humor, and

220
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.970
you put, obviously the science is there

221
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.169
and the credentials are there,

222
00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:08.810
but you peaked some peoples' curiosity

223
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.959
yesterday with a very large rendition of sperm.

224
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.368
<v ->That interests almost everybody.</v>

225
00:10:14.368 --> 00:10:15.187
<v Woman>That's right.</v>

226
00:10:15.187 --> 00:10:17.787
But let's go a little bit more into why

227
00:10:17.787 --> 00:10:19.428
you would've chosen that in particular

228
00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:22.468
and that is, in the hieroglyphics,

229
00:10:22.468 --> 00:10:25.467
I'd have to go through my notes here,

230
00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:27.027
where is that particular depiction?

231
00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:30.888
<v ->It's the tomb of Ramses, either the 6th or the 9th,</v>

232
00:10:30.888 --> 00:10:34.228
I think it's the 6th, and it comes from

233
00:10:34.228 --> 00:10:37.308
a cosmological tableau on one of the walls,

234
00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:39.948
depicting the creation of the universe.

235
00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:43.928
In this depiction of the creation,

236
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:47.288
one very, one principle of the Egyptian

237
00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:48.828
creation myth, there are a number of them

238
00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:52.067
which are complementary, they're not different,

239
00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:56.355
it's like the same scene in a room,

240
00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.875
but seen through different windows

241
00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.154
or different doors so it looks different

242
00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:02.504
from each angle, but really its the same scene.

243
00:11:02.504 --> 00:11:05.822
So, Atun, who is the great creator god,

244
00:11:05.822 --> 00:11:07.441
who I sometimes refer to as the god

245
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.222
before the gods came into being,

246
00:11:10.222 --> 00:11:12.622
through an act of masturbation

247
00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:16.002
creates the first pair, the first man and woman,

248
00:11:16.002 --> 00:11:20.232
the first masculine/feminine, the first positive/negative.

249
00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:26.442
This then gives rise to a whole further set of gods,

250
00:11:26.482 --> 00:11:29.745
and by the time you're finished, there are 10 of them.

251
00:11:29.745 --> 00:11:32.305
Leading eventually to Isis and Osiris,

252
00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:35.665
which really represents the role of humanity

253
00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:37.545
within the grand cosmic scheme and the

254
00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:41.404
scenes, or the parts of the myth,

255
00:11:41.404 --> 00:11:44.864
preceding it are the stages of cosmogenesis

256
00:11:44.864 --> 00:11:48.185
from the first polarity to the universe itself

257
00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:51.065
to the breath of life across to the separation

258
00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:55.784
of earth and heaven and the breath of life

259
00:11:55.784 --> 00:11:58.354
across the waters and then the

260
00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:03.354
Isis, Osiris, Horus, Seth, Isis, Osiris

261
00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:08.412
Seth, Osiris, Seth, Isis, Nephthis, and then Horus,

262
00:12:08.412 --> 00:12:11.501
this actually represents symbolically

263
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.202
the role of humanity within the grand cosmic scheme,

264
00:12:14.202 --> 00:12:16.902
which is central to the Egyptian doctrine

265
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:20.162
and virtually every other serious

266
00:12:20.162 --> 00:12:23.702
metaphysical esoteric system there ever was.

267
00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:24.969
<v Woman>And they didn't do anything by accident,</v>

268
00:12:24.969 --> 00:12:26.909
these were not accidental in any way.

269
00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:28.728
It appears there are no accidents anywhere

270
00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:32.169
in the architecture or hieroglyphics at all.

271
00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:33.689
<v ->It's clear that they know because</v>

272
00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:35.589
there are these four little snakes,

273
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.189
each with a human head with a beard on it,

274
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:41.889
which is the symbol of a divinity,

275
00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:44.049
a bearded head with a beard that

276
00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:46.089
goes like that is a divinity, but then

277
00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:47.509
at the end of the snakes, there are millions

278
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:49.169
of snakes and serpents and cobras

279
00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:51.908
throughout Egyptian symbolism and

280
00:12:51.908 --> 00:12:53.549
the symbolism of other cultures as well,

281
00:12:53.549 --> 00:12:55.629
but in this case, and only in this case,

282
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:57.249
there's a little hook on the tail

283
00:12:57.249 --> 00:12:59.989
and that little hook, and the texts say,

284
00:12:59.989 --> 00:13:03.289
this is the sperm of Atun, and as far as we know,

285
00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:05.829
they didn't have anything resembling

286
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:09.849
a normal magnifying glass, there's some question

287
00:13:09.849 --> 00:13:11.209
about whether they could have used

288
00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:14.769
a cow's eye to magnify, but I'm not sure,

289
00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:18.449
but I think that you need a fairly advanced

290
00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:21.749
microscope in order to see what a sperm cell looks like.

291
00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:23.368
So, how did they know, we don't know,

292
00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:25.328
because an awful lot that they knew

293
00:13:25.328 --> 00:13:27.969
and we don't know how they acquired it,

294
00:13:27.969 --> 00:13:29.849
but this applies throughout ancient

295
00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:31.618
knowledge all over the place, in other words,

296
00:13:31.618 --> 00:13:33.558
our assumption and our arrogance,

297
00:13:33.558 --> 00:13:35.398
church of progress arrogance, that

298
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.538
the way we acquire knowledge is the

299
00:13:37.538 --> 00:13:39.098
only way to acquire knowledge.

300
00:13:39.098 --> 00:13:42.898
But we know, anybody who's actually read the literature,

301
00:13:42.898 --> 00:13:45.258
or in fact, gone through the experiences know that

302
00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:48.558
shamans and other developed human beings,

303
00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:50.858
even if they can't do high energy physics,

304
00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:54.138
or even complicated mathematics,

305
00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:57.238
they have ways of knowing things that

306
00:13:57.238 --> 00:14:00.397
cannot be explained by any rational beings.

307
00:14:00.397 --> 00:14:04.158
The example I like to use is acupuncture.

308
00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:05.818
It's quite clear that acupuncture works.

309
00:14:05.818 --> 00:14:08.258
It's quite clear that there are such meridians,

310
00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:11.137
even though up to now, they've not been detected.

311
00:14:11.137 --> 00:14:12.638
I've just read the other day somewhere,

312
00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:15.798
that they've now been able to trace the

313
00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:18.678
meridians someway or another, one of the

314
00:14:18.678 --> 00:14:20.818
speakers here was talking about it.

315
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.757
<v Woman>Radioactive isotopes, they've been able to do it.</v>

316
00:14:22.757 --> 00:14:24.517
<v ->They check it somehow or another.</v>

317
00:14:24.517 --> 00:14:26.667
But the point is that without that,

318
00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:29.338
there's no way, no possible way,

319
00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:32.958
that anybody could develop that system

320
00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.518
on a rational basis, I mean, nobody

321
00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:37.818
is going to stick a pin in somebody's toe

322
00:14:37.818 --> 00:14:40.178
and all of a sudden his kidney gets better,

323
00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:41.778
and then they say, well, let's try

324
00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:44.057
sticking a pin in the other toe.

325
00:14:44.057 --> 00:14:47.838
It's impossible, that's right, it's impossible.

326
00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:50.378
So it's quite clear that they did know,

327
00:14:50.378 --> 00:14:55.158
and how they knew is, to us, virtually

328
00:14:55.158 --> 00:14:57.637
inconceivable except by analogy,

329
00:14:57.637 --> 00:15:01.458
because shamans and yogis and zen masters

330
00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:03.358
and people like that do acquire knowledge,

331
00:15:03.358 --> 00:15:06.478
but through a certain kind of inner training,

332
00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:10.418
and to normal, untrained human beings,

333
00:15:10.418 --> 00:15:14.158
me, for example, can't get that.

334
00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:17.498
<v Woman>So, obviously they were getting it</v>

335
00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:20.258
and we could go down any number of tracks right here,

336
00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:22.518
but what you were saying also,

337
00:15:22.518 --> 00:15:26.358
which appears to be true, if you look

338
00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:27.858
at some of the depictions is that they,

339
00:15:27.858 --> 00:15:30.558
it wasn't just the gods, but even the royalty,

340
00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:33.478
were apparently initiates of some

341
00:15:33.478 --> 00:15:36.788
kind and had access to knowledge.

342
00:15:36.788 --> 00:15:41.788
<v ->Probably, because simply, any organization</v>

343
00:15:42.628 --> 00:15:45.527
runs from the top on down, and if the top

344
00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.507
are drunk or crazy or stupid, the whole civilization

345
00:15:48.507 --> 00:15:52.187
disappears, as we're about to see.

346
00:15:52.187 --> 00:15:55.267
It's almost certain that the pharaohs

347
00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:58.907
must have gone through considerable

348
00:15:58.907 --> 00:16:01.667
rigorous training in order to keep a society

349
00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:04.647
coherent for 3,000 years, even though,

350
00:16:04.647 --> 00:16:06.427
and this is another very interesting question,

351
00:16:06.427 --> 00:16:09.847
it was in decline almost from its very beginning.

352
00:16:09.847 --> 00:16:12.946
Its high point was the Old Kingdom about 2700 B.C.

353
00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:15.607
And then it proceeded to go downhill

354
00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:18.267
up to the time of Julius Caesar and then

355
00:16:18.267 --> 00:16:20.867
as a coherent civilization it disappeared.

356
00:16:20.867 --> 00:16:22.467
Now that is another matter all together,

357
00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:27.467
but gets us back to our gold ages or yugas

358
00:16:28.307 --> 00:16:31.467
or whatever it is that's responsible for that.

359
00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:32.135
<v Woman>But obviously some are trying</v>

360
00:16:32.135 --> 00:16:33.596
to preserve that knowledge, I mean,

361
00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:35.116
the depictions are there, do you think

362
00:16:35.116 --> 00:16:37.446
that some of this information was

363
00:16:37.446 --> 00:16:40.516
left literally for us to rediscover it in another time?

364
00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:47.135
<v ->I don't know actually; it's tempting to think so.</v>

365
00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:49.175
I'm more inclined to think that the pyramids

366
00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.915
and some of these gigantic structures,

367
00:16:50.915 --> 00:16:55.375
that one function they may have served

368
00:16:57.455 --> 00:17:02.455
is that people at that time, sages,

369
00:17:02.764 --> 00:17:04.164
enlightened people, understood

370
00:17:04.164 --> 00:17:08.644
that the cycle was on a downhill slope,

371
00:17:08.644 --> 00:17:13.024
and so encoded it maybe for the benefit

372
00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:14.984
of future generations, and also maybe,

373
00:17:14.984 --> 00:17:16.564
since I'm convinced that tombs,

374
00:17:16.564 --> 00:17:19.924
that the pyramids are energetic structures

375
00:17:19.924 --> 00:17:23.564
of some sort, that they actually have a

376
00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:25.784
technological function, I'd like to think,

377
00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:27.404
maybe to re-spiritualize the Earth

378
00:17:27.404 --> 00:17:29.984
or to carry out initiatic ceremonies within them,

379
00:17:29.984 --> 00:17:33.624
something of that sort, but otherwise the temples

380
00:17:33.624 --> 00:17:36.824
are there for the people to use,

381
00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:38.484
or for the priesthood to use, and the

382
00:17:38.484 --> 00:17:40.564
function of sacred architecture, actually,

383
00:17:40.564 --> 00:17:43.144
is not to propitiate the gods,

384
00:17:43.144 --> 00:17:44.883
which the academics would like to think,

385
00:17:44.883 --> 00:17:46.423
or not even to worship them in a sense,

386
00:17:46.423 --> 00:17:50.784
because of sacred geometry, the gods

387
00:17:50.784 --> 00:17:53.344
should be understood anyhow as cosmic principles,

388
00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:55.984
and once they're understood as cosmic principles,

389
00:17:55.984 --> 00:18:00.984
the whole polytheism theme disappears,

390
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:02.921
because it's not polytheism at all,

391
00:18:02.921 --> 00:18:06.721
it's simply the cosmic principles upon

392
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:09.781
which the universe is founded, through which,

393
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:13.861
knowledgeably or just automatically,

394
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:16.021
we are able to make some sort of sense

395
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:17.941
out of the material world around us.

396
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:19.741
Without the principles, it would just be chaos.

397
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:24.741
Anyway, the so-called gods are each of them

398
00:18:25.761 --> 00:18:27.921
connected in one way or are associated

399
00:18:27.921 --> 00:18:29.961
with certain numbers and those numbers

400
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:34.541
give rise to certain kinds of geometry,

401
00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:36.361
certain proportions, certain measures,

402
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:39.160
and when those, when the geometry,

403
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.641
harmonies, proportions, measures

404
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:43.971
are incorporated into a given structure

405
00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:46.010
by people who know what they're doing,

406
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.510
then we get a temple of Luxor, or a Karnak,

407
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.849
or Abydos, or Dendera, or whatever,

408
00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:52.670
and when you walk into those places,

409
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.210
you get a hit from it, I mean,

410
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.910
you have to be not just brain dead,

411
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.810
but emotionally defective and spiritually dyslexic,

412
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.010
not to get something out of Egypt.

413
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.490
And this is one of the things on my trips,

414
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.231
sometimes I like to say, why is Egypt like sex?

415
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.910
Egypt is like sex because you can read about it

416
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.810
from now until doomsday, and you can even watch

417
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.210
pictures, but until you've experienced it,

418
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.230
you don't understand a damn thing.

419
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.270
And so, with Egypt, even in ruins,

420
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.740
and even now there are a lot of crowds,

421
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.310
and I find ways on my own trips to avoid the crowds mostly -

422
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.278
<v Woman>You've devoted many years to this.</v>

423
00:19:31.278 --> 00:19:35.548
<v ->Oh yeah, well, yes, partly, that's</v>

424
00:19:35.548 --> 00:19:36.907
where most of my living comes from.

425
00:19:36.907 --> 00:19:39.547
I'm sort of living proof that fame and fortune

426
00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:41.227
do not necessarily go together,

427
00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:43.147
and I sometimes think I'd rather be

428
00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:45.107
an obscure billionaire, but yeah,

429
00:19:45.107 --> 00:19:47.328
I've been leading the trips now for over 20 years

430
00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:49.858
and it is a real difference, I mean,

431
00:19:49.858 --> 00:19:52.058
it's fun giving a lecture here at CPAK,

432
00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:55.098
but when I have my people and there we are

433
00:19:55.098 --> 00:19:56.858
meditating in the Great Pyramid or

434
00:19:56.858 --> 00:19:59.438
walking through one of these incredible temples and

435
00:19:59.438 --> 00:20:04.018
making sense of it via Schwaller's simplest interpretation,

436
00:20:04.018 --> 00:20:05.726
the whole thing, people go home,

437
00:20:05.726 --> 00:20:08.986
it's very rare that somebody doesn't use,

438
00:20:08.986 --> 00:20:10.746
it becomes a hackneyed phrase,

439
00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:13.546
a life-changing experience, but that's Egypt

440
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.646
and other old civilizations have

441
00:20:16.646 --> 00:20:17.886
produced the same effect,

442
00:20:17.886 --> 00:20:20.506
you go into Shandra Cathedral, you can't miss it.

443
00:20:20.506 --> 00:20:22.766
And you go into Indian temples or

444
00:20:22.766 --> 00:20:26.826
some of the great Islamic mosques,

445
00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:29.346
and you get it there as well, but it's only

446
00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:31.446
in Egypt where it's at that level of,

447
00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:36.446
the prodigious size of it all,

448
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.686
and then the variation between temple

449
00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:41.206
to temple to temple, cathedrals

450
00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:45.306
are more or less, you can't say

451
00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:47.066
once you've seen one you've seen them all,

452
00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:51.066
but basically it's the same message

453
00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:52.506
and the same with the mosques,

454
00:20:52.506 --> 00:20:55.646
Indian temples are considerably more varied

455
00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:57.986
and you go back still further into Cambodia

456
00:20:57.986 --> 00:21:00.366
and places like that, but Egypt, you get this

457
00:21:00.366 --> 00:21:03.646
real hit on a day to day basis, and people come out

458
00:21:03.646 --> 00:21:06.846
let's say, exhilarated but exhausted.

459
00:21:06.846 --> 00:21:08.646
<v Woman>I want to go on one of your trips with you.</v>

460
00:21:08.646 --> 00:21:11.056
I'm going to work it out, I want to go there with you

461
00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:12.353
one day with you and I'm serious about it.

462
00:21:12.353 --> 00:21:14.214
Meanwhile, let's tie it back into procession,

463
00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:18.394
because there's huge dispute among the

464
00:21:18.394 --> 00:21:20.933
scientific community about the ages of

465
00:21:20.933 --> 00:21:23.434
these structures and when the original layers

466
00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:24.833
of these structures were built,

467
00:21:24.833 --> 00:21:26.414
and this may have something to do

468
00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:28.153
tying it back with the procession,

469
00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:30.973
I can guess, in terms of higher knowledges

470
00:21:30.973 --> 00:21:33.313
that descended and now may be coming back,

471
00:21:33.313 --> 00:21:34.893
if we make it through this next little bit.

472
00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:37.852
<v ->Well, if we make it through the next bit.</v>

473
00:21:37.852 --> 00:21:41.473
Not exactly, I mean, one is one

474
00:21:41.473 --> 00:21:43.042
question and the other is the other.

475
00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:47.042
Dating for most of the structures in Egypt and elsewhere,

476
00:21:47.042 --> 00:21:50.022
is not too much problem with the dating.

477
00:21:50.022 --> 00:21:52.422
It's the Sphinx and the Giza plateau

478
00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:54.602
because the pyramids, for example,

479
00:21:54.602 --> 00:21:57.441
are quite demonstrably built in stages,

480
00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:59.142
we can prove this, and there are a few

481
00:21:59.142 --> 00:22:01.102
other places in Egypt where you see this.

482
00:22:01.102 --> 00:22:04.202
Elsewhere in the world, it's now becoming

483
00:22:04.202 --> 00:22:06.322
quite clear that the megaliths that are

484
00:22:06.322 --> 00:22:07.942
all over Europe and all over America

485
00:22:07.942 --> 00:22:10.761
and all over the world, some of them date

486
00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:13.282
much further back than anyone expected,

487
00:22:13.282 --> 00:22:15.762
but the main thing is that the knowledge

488
00:22:15.762 --> 00:22:18.882
encoded in them, mainly geodesic,

489
00:22:18.882 --> 00:22:20.382
that's the science of Earth measures,

490
00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:25.382
and geodesic and astronomical,

491
00:22:25.542 --> 00:22:28.362
is tremendously sophisticated.

492
00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:30.422
The argument is over how sophisticated,

493
00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:33.262
and of course the -

494
00:22:33.262 --> 00:22:36.320
<v Woman>And without aerial maps, extremely sophisticated.</v>

495
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.720
<v ->Well, without aerial maps, there are the</v>

496
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.400
ancient maps that show the outlines of,

497
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.800
Western outlines of North and South

498
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.460
America and Antarctica -

499
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.080
<v Woman>Right, Graham Hancock's</v>

500
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.619
Fingerprints of the Gods, yeah.

501
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:51.899
<v ->Right, and those, my guess is, those</v>

502
00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:53.218
somehow or another survived the

503
00:22:53.218 --> 00:22:55.958
destruction of the Alexandria library

504
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.538
and surfaced somewhere in Turkey or

505
00:22:58.538 --> 00:23:02.138
the Middle East to be used by the early

506
00:23:02.138 --> 00:23:05.518
Western explorers going over to the New World.

507
00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:07.458
<v Woman>The number that keeps coming up</v>

508
00:23:07.458 --> 00:23:08.778
in this conference and came up in

509
00:23:08.778 --> 00:23:11.998
your work as well is 10,500 B.C.

510
00:23:11.998 --> 00:23:16.018
<v ->The Sphinx seems to scream out as a Leo marker.</v>

511
00:23:16.018 --> 00:23:20.018
The last Leo, the last age of Leo, the ingress into Leo

512
00:23:20.018 --> 00:23:23.278
was about 10,500 B.C., but me, I think an

513
00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:25.818
actually more extreme view, based upon

514
00:23:25.818 --> 00:23:27.498
Egyptian texts themselves where they

515
00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:30.317
talk about these long reigns of divine kings

516
00:23:30.317 --> 00:23:32.817
and then still another period of long reigns

517
00:23:32.817 --> 00:23:34.616
by semi-divine beings called the

518
00:23:34.616 --> 00:23:36.236
Followers and Companions of Horus,

519
00:23:36.236 --> 00:23:39.017
and we compute the regnal years out,

520
00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:42.317
you get somewhere around 34,000 or 36,000 years

521
00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:46.897
and actually the age of Leo before 10,500

522
00:23:46.897 --> 00:23:51.247
is about 36,000 B.C., and me, intuitively,

523
00:23:51.247 --> 00:23:53.325
I feel like for the Sphinx to have gotten

524
00:23:53.325 --> 00:23:56.205
into the condition it's in, the lots and lots

525
00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:57.925
of rain over long periods of time,

526
00:23:57.925 --> 00:24:01.535
it almost requires those tremendous lengths of time

527
00:24:01.535 --> 00:24:03.883
in order to produce those kinds of pneumatic effects.

528
00:24:03.883 --> 00:24:05.784
That's something that we hope to resolve,

529
00:24:05.784 --> 00:24:08.023
or at least partially resolve,

530
00:24:08.023 --> 00:24:10.224
or approach the problem, let's say,

531
00:24:10.224 --> 00:24:13.003
with our geopanel that we're putting together now,

532
00:24:13.003 --> 00:24:15.623
where we intend to go over three on our side,

533
00:24:15.623 --> 00:24:19.342
three opponents, and duke it out on the Giza plateau,

534
00:24:19.342 --> 00:24:21.343
and then everyone writes papers and

535
00:24:21.343 --> 00:24:22.963
let the chips fall where they may.

536
00:24:22.963 --> 00:24:26.284
But I'm hoping that the results are

537
00:24:26.284 --> 00:24:29.783
positive enough to actually jumpstart,

538
00:24:29.783 --> 00:24:32.263
and I feel that that could be because it

539
00:24:32.263 --> 00:24:35.243
is so easy to understand, it could be

540
00:24:35.243 --> 00:24:37.533
the battering ram that breaks down the

541
00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:40.662
portcullis of the ivory towers of academia.

542
00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:42.962
<v Woman>Absolutely, and I couldn't</v>

543
00:24:42.962 --> 00:24:44.263
wish you more luck on that one.

544
00:24:44.263 --> 00:24:45.922
I really hope you guys can get

545
00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:48.483
some consensus on it, at least you can get

546
00:24:48.483 --> 00:24:50.302
them somewhat on board on the other side.

547
00:24:50.302 --> 00:24:51.142
<v ->No, you know, we won't.</v>

548
00:24:51.142 --> 00:24:53.622
The ones, they'll go down with the ship, most of them.

549
00:24:53.622 --> 00:24:55.632
What will happen is some of the younger ones,

550
00:24:55.632 --> 00:24:57.293
some of the younger ones and people

551
00:24:57.293 --> 00:24:58.911
who are not necessarily even involved

552
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:00.791
in the discipline but are smart enough

553
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.751
to look at evidence and understand what it is,

554
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.892
they start making a bunch of noise and

555
00:25:04.892 --> 00:25:07.431
suddenly it becomes unfashionable to be,

556
00:25:07.431 --> 00:25:11.572
it becomes unfashionable to be traditional.

557
00:25:11.572 --> 00:25:15.291
And at that point, maybe things start to change,

558
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:19.871
but really, one of the lists of the world's shortest books,

559
00:25:19.871 --> 00:25:22.671
joking around years ago, probably the shortest

560
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:25.131
of them all is New Ideas in Egyptology.

561
00:25:26.771 --> 00:25:28.630
<v Woman>Well, you're certainly doing your part.</v>

562
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.770
<v ->I'm doing my best.</v>

563
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.891
<v Woman>John Anthony West, I'm just</v>

564
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:32.510
saying that because I love the sound of your name.

565
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.810
Thank you so much for your time,

566
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.010
and I hope to be with you on one of

567
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.139
those journeys and I'm sure some of our

568
00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:37.259
viewers will be as well.

569
00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:38.919
<v ->I hope you will be, thank you.</v>

570
00:25:41.449 --> 00:25:42.848
<v ->Please go to John's website below to</v>

571
00:25:42.848 --> 00:25:44.549
see about joining him in what is

572
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:47.629
bound to be a trip of a lifetime tour to Egypt.

573
00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.088
You can also purchase his books
