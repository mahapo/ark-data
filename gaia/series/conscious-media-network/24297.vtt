00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.290
<v ->Irish-born James O'Dea,</v>

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.957
president of the Institute of Noetic Sciences,

3
00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:09.138
is one of the most poetic voices for peace alive today.

4
00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:11.047
I was mesmerized as I heard him lecture

5
00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:14.480
on the subject of the science of peace and transformation.

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.910
What most impressed me was that

7
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.108
he knows about peace from the trenches.

8
00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:19.836
For ten years, he was the director

9
00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:23.759
of the Washington, D.C. center for Amnesty International.

10
00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.395
He spent those years amid the rubble of broken bodies

11
00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:29.243
and lives, interceding on the behalf of those

12
00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:30.789
who had no voice.

13
00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.328
He has learned, on this incredible journey through life,

14
00:00:33.328 --> 00:00:36.293
that mankind possesses and indomitable spirit

15
00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:39.461
that cannot be destroyed, a spirit that we are now seeking

16
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:42.426
to evolve, individually and collectively.

17
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:47.315 line:15% 
(soft piano music)

18
00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.228
You're using mythology to help us

19
00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.991
begin to understand the process of transformation,

20
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.941
and I like what you're doing, and you're using the story

21
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:04.025
of Ulysses, the Sirens, and Orpheus.

22
00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.222
And so, would you begin telling us,

23
00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:08.494
why the journey of Ulysses?

24
00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:11.950
And at what point in the story this mythology begins?

25
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.785
And then we'll start working with it.

26
00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:18.804
<v ->Martin Luther King</v>

27
00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:23.199
was very convinced about a primary notion,

28
00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.106
that we can't simply

29
00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:29.743
be opposed when it comes to war and peace.

30
00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:32.345
We have to be for something,

31
00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:35.450
we have to enter fully into its universe.

32
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.759
And so he gave the example of Ulysses

33
00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.430
and the journey of Ulysses

34
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.214
in relationship to the Sirens, who pull,

35
00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:50.863
in their seductive way,

36
00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:53.443
with their semi-beautiful song,

37
00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:56.781
the men into the rocks

38
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:58.787
and they die.

39
00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:03.650
And then finally, he discovers that what is needed

40
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.272
is something like Orpheus,

41
00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:09.058
is a true music,

42
00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:12.849
a music of the heart and soul that will rise above.

43
00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.366
And so you have this contrast

44
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:20.005
in this mythic story of the adventure of Ulysses,

45
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.642
or the great journey, and this is just one of the prisms

46
00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.010
that we can look through that great journey

47
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.181
and see that, in our time,

48
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:35.097
we have to be very discerning about the seductions

49
00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:38.266
that are there, that are pulling people away

50
00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:42.927
from their own heroic journey, from their great task,

51
00:02:42.927 --> 00:02:45.640
and to be able to recognize

52
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.707
the true spiritual music, the calling of consciousness,

53
00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:52.800
the arising of consciousness itself.

54
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.572
And I firmly believe

55
00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:58.340
that we are so hard-wired

56
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.692
into the cosmos itself that we, in fact,

57
00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:06.670
can hear the truest music

58
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.350
and unplug

59
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.476
the myriad voices of seduction.

60
00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:14.876
<v Interviewer>If we hear it, we know it.</v>

61
00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:17.564
The problem is, the sound is being drown out

62
00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.028
by all of the music of seduction.

63
00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:22.385
And speak to that, if you would please,

64
00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:24.956
about the various ways in which we are seduced

65
00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:27.946
away from being on our paths.

66
00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:29.605
I mean, for a lack of better word, seduced away

67
00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:30.737
from our dharma.

68
00:03:31.873 --> 00:03:32.992
<v ->Indeed.</v>

69
00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:39.204
One of the modalities that is just

70
00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:42.254
part of the complexity of modern life,

71
00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:44.751
is the flow of information,

72
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.751
that in just the course of a few weeks now,

73
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:53.017
we are absorbing more information than our counterparts

74
00:03:53.017 --> 00:03:57.081
in the Middle Ages probably absorbed in a whole lifetime.

75
00:03:57.081 --> 00:04:00.377
So we are information saturated,

76
00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:03.523
and it becomes very difficult, when information

77
00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:07.672
is at that accelerated speed coming towards us

78
00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:11.106
to discern, "What is real? What is true here?

79
00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:13.368
"What is really based in reality?

80
00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:16.184
"Or what is just a mirage, an illusion?"

81
00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:18.828
And it's a very dangerous time in that sense,

82
00:04:18.828 --> 00:04:22.871
because if you're skillful you can put what we would call

83
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.106
a viral meme,

84
00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:28.786
just a piece of meaning that is able

85
00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:31.933
to connect with other meanings, into the stream

86
00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:35.730
of information, and people digest it, and it affects

87
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.506
the physiology, because if the little virus

88
00:04:39.506 --> 00:04:43.185
that you're sending out through the information realms

89
00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:46.950
is a fear, "Be afraid of this,"

90
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.745
it's going to go right into your physiology.

91
00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:53.819
It's going to affect you at a fundamental level.

92
00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.772
You know, people flocked to The Matrix

93
00:04:56.772 --> 00:04:59.232
in their millions,

94
00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.824
and here's a movie that really was trying to deal

95
00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:06.644
with this topic based on the work of a French philosopher,

96
00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:11.283
Baudrillard, who said we're in a time where

97
00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:14.494
it's not only a simple simulation of reality.

98
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:17.966
You pretend you're driving the car or flying the plane,

99
00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.612
but you're not, that's a simulation.

100
00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:23.396
He used another word, simulacrum,

101
00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:28.025
for when the symbol has no reality behind it,

102
00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:30.179
when it's pure spin.

103
00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:34.509
And we live in an era where we can't tell

104
00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.760
what is pure spin from reality.

105
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.663
Well, I think we can, but that's part of the seduction

106
00:05:40.663 --> 00:05:42.552
that we're talking about.

107
00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:47.536
So then we look at, how do we follow our dharma,

108
00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:51.259
as you put it, how do we go deeply

109
00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.954
into our own truth?

110
00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:56.823
How do we find our way

111
00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.914
back to reality?

112
00:05:58.914 --> 00:06:02.158
And one of the most extraordinary

113
00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:04.270
and hopeful things

114
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.003
that modern science is able to tell us is,

115
00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:10.488
the answer lies in your body.

116
00:06:10.488 --> 00:06:13.506
Not the answer, I should say, but one answer.

117
00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.564
That your body is an instrument

118
00:06:16.564 --> 00:06:18.924
of universal intelligence.

119
00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:22.780
It is so connected to the reality of the cosmos

120
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.047
that, if you go in and listen to your body,

121
00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:29.946
listen to your deepest intuitions,

122
00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:32.416
you begin to activate

123
00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:36.625
the antidote to the Maya, to the realm of confusion

124
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:40.668
and mirage, because right in there, your body, your gut,

125
00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:43.174
your gut has a deep intelligence.

126
00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:46.320
At the Institute of Noetic Sciences, we've done research

127
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.104
on the responsivity of the gut to remote influences.

128
00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:52.972
We could go through many examples like that

129
00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:56.501
and find in the heart, in the mind,

130
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.355
in the gut,

131
00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:03.070
a tremendous receptivity to something that is alive,

132
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.428
we believe, in cosmic reality.

133
00:07:06.688 --> 00:07:08.752
<v Interviewer>This brings to mind, as you're speaking,</v>

134
00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.096
how well that was portrayed.

135
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.859
Very funny, very alive, but how well that was portrayed

136
00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:14.107
in What the Bleep?

137
00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:16.091
The neuropeptides and the response in the stomach

138
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.247
and what happens, how you begin creating the next phase

139
00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:21.177
of your own reality as the stomach

140
00:07:21.177 --> 00:07:23.343
is trying to speak to you, and as you say,

141
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.933
the heart is speaking to you.

142
00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:28.094
And there are even portions of the brain,

143
00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:31.062
believe it or not, that are telling us the truth

144
00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:33.377
from time to time, if we could hear them.

145
00:07:33.377 --> 00:07:35.478
And can you speak to that a little bit?

146
00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:37.635
<v ->Well, we know that,</v>

147
00:07:37.635 --> 00:07:40.728
when a person starts to meditate

148
00:07:40.728 --> 00:07:44.824
and really gets into the meditation, that the brain begins

149
00:07:44.824 --> 00:07:46.273
to synchronize.

150
00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:51.524
Prior to the meditation, the energy field is scattered.

151
00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:54.083
The heart coherence is scattered.

152
00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.174
And the brain is scattered.

153
00:07:56.174 --> 00:07:59.566
You could look at an MRI of the brain and see,

154
00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:01.294
"Oh, this part, and this part, and this part

155
00:08:01.294 --> 00:08:02.733
"are all lighting up."

156
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:05.539
As the meditation really gets underway,

157
00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:10.114
the whole thing begins to look orchestral, harmonizing.

158
00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:12.820
And, in fact, the parietal lobes

159
00:08:14.415 --> 00:08:18.415
show signs of activity, which is where our sense of space

160
00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.729
and confinement exists.

161
00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:25.347
It's as if we begin to dissolve that strong sense

162
00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:29.315
of the local presence, and we open, open, open

163
00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:30.872
to the universe.

164
00:08:30.872 --> 00:08:34.210
And then we know now, in the heart science

165
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.464
that's developed so much, that we know in meditation,

166
00:08:37.464 --> 00:08:40.813
again, breathing, breathing into your heart,

167
00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:44.311
it really reduces cortisol, which is that fragmenting,

168
00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:46.049
hyperfocusing.

169
00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:47.959
<v Interviewer>I'm going to speak to you about that</v>

170
00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:49.326
in a moment.
<v ->Biochemical.</v>

171
00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:53.303
But what we've also discovered now is,

172
00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:54.648
so you're breathing into your heart,

173
00:08:54.648 --> 00:08:57.399
and then you add into your heart

174
00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:00.531
just the presence of one person that you love,

175
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.714
and that activates the body in a tremendous way.

176
00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:08.680
It releases hormones, dopamine, DHEA.

177
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.703
So now we can have a science that is peering into

178
00:09:12.703 --> 00:09:16.558
as love is remembered, is felt in the body,

179
00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:18.895
how the body goes into this flow,

180
00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:21.296
this sense of renewal.

181
00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:25.964
So this moment is so precious, where science is turning

182
00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:30.731
towards spiritual reality, and affirming,

183
00:09:30.731 --> 00:09:35.489
in some very important ways, the quality and the depth

184
00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:37.010
of that reality.

185
00:09:38.087 --> 00:09:40.428
<v Interviewer>And we're attempting, as a species,</v>

186
00:09:40.428 --> 00:09:43.233
to find our way more toward the quietude, as you say,

187
00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:45.867
toward the meditative state so that we can hear,

188
00:09:45.867 --> 00:09:47.819
so that we can hear our own innate intelligence,

189
00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:49.856
and the cosmic intelligence, and the guidance

190
00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:52.330
that's there around us all the time that we may

191
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.891
or mostly don't listen to.

192
00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:59.705
And yet, right now, it has to pierce this need,

193
00:09:59.705 --> 00:10:02.836
on some level, because it wouldn't be displaying otherwise,

194
00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:06.546
a need for extreme amounts of adrenaline.

195
00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:08.209
The way we're living right now.

196
00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.893
And it went from the martini generation

197
00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:13.121
to the Starbucks generation.

198
00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:15.095
So we're amped up more and more and more,

199
00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:19.501
adrenaline rushes, working harder, extreme sports.

200
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:22.614
How do we begin to even quiet that down?

201
00:10:22.614 --> 00:10:24.566
And that doesn't get into the other Sirens,

202
00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:27.339
such as parents,

203
00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:29.576
the parenting model,

204
00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:34.266
that we need to succumb to a higher authority's viewpoint,

205
00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:37.679
patriotism, anesthetics, drugs and alcohol.

206
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.537
How do we begin piercing through these

207
00:10:40.537 --> 00:10:43.385
to be able to move beyond these Sirens,

208
00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:46.392
to hear the voice of Orpheus, or the true voice?

209
00:10:47.967 --> 00:10:52.373
<v ->So we live at a time when we have more affluence</v>

210
00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:55.893
than ever before, and yet we see increased

211
00:10:55.893 --> 00:10:59.166
mental health problems, increased depression,

212
00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:03.232
increased use of pharmaceuticals, increased stress.

213
00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:07.239
So all of those indicators are not going away.

214
00:11:07.239 --> 00:11:09.564
They're very persistent, and in some cases,

215
00:11:09.564 --> 00:11:12.764
particularly with regard to youth, stress,

216
00:11:12.764 --> 00:11:14.940
they are on the increase.

217
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.162
And there is no simple

218
00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:20.476
or immediate response to this.

219
00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:24.657
Certainly, I believe there is a massive overuse

220
00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:27.548
of the pharmacological response of,

221
00:11:27.548 --> 00:11:31.982
"Sedate it at any cost. Sedate it."

222
00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:35.502
And so we go back, and we discover,

223
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.903
Einstein once said that the greatest theories

224
00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:43.421
will be full of simplicity and beauty.

225
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:47.138
And we discover that gratitude,

226
00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:48.978
that gratefulness,

227
00:11:48.978 --> 00:11:52.974
is a tremendous antidote to stress

228
00:11:52.974 --> 00:11:55.417
and to trauma,

229
00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:59.288
because, in gratitude, when we are grateful,

230
00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:02.445
when we start to be thankful, even in the face

231
00:12:02.445 --> 00:12:05.453
of when we're hurt, when we say,

232
00:12:06.483 --> 00:12:10.549
"I feel justifiedly upset. I've been injured," you know.

233
00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:12.746
"What have you done to me?"

234
00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:16.319
If, in that process, one can say to the universe,

235
00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:21.215
"And thank you, thank you for sending that test my way.

236
00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:23.923
"Thank you for reminding me. Thank you for

237
00:12:23.923 --> 00:12:27.251
"even however bitter it is."

238
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:29.630
It's almost as if we trump the universe.

239
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.986
The universe says, "Okay."

240
00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:35.150
And we begin to experience what positive psychology

241
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.891
refers to as flow.

242
00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:39.450
We start to experience the flow of the universe

243
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.289
in gratefulness, because it can't knock us away.

244
00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:47.354
We are simply in a place of acceptance and gratitude.

245
00:12:47.354 --> 00:12:51.802
That is a tremendous opener to then a deeper sense of peace,

246
00:12:51.802 --> 00:12:53.775
and a deeper sense of well-being,

247
00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:55.754
and a deeper sense of love.

248
00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:57.293
<v Inteviewer>That makes total sense because,</v>

249
00:12:57.293 --> 00:12:59.855
even in your own mind, if we stop for just a moment

250
00:12:59.855 --> 00:13:03.823
and think of what it feels like to be grateful for anything,

251
00:13:03.823 --> 00:13:06.991
really, you feel this expansive, upward, opening

252
00:13:06.991 --> 00:13:10.670
type of movement, rather than, conversely,

253
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.700
stopping to think of someone or something or event

254
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.824
in a very critical fashion, you can feel it physiologically

255
00:13:16.824 --> 00:13:19.187
immediately starting to implode,

256
00:13:19.187 --> 00:13:21.971
starting to close the mind down, close the heart down,

257
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:23.987
close your digestion down.

258
00:13:23.987 --> 00:13:28.820
So really, we can utilize our bodies as our measurement,

259
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.977
per say, as to the quality of our thoughts.

260
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:35.310
Would that be a good place, also, to begin?

261
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.801
<v ->Yes, I believe that</v>

262
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:40.794
the body, mind,

263
00:13:40.794 --> 00:13:43.759
spirit interfusion,

264
00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:47.497
we now have to look for words of the wholeness

265
00:13:47.497 --> 00:13:51.742
of how they interconnect, is an emerging reality,

266
00:13:51.742 --> 00:13:54.322
but it's also a state of consciousness.

267
00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:57.660
We talked about the Ulysses myth.

268
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.585
I've sometimes also used the myth from the book of Genesis

269
00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:05.041
in which Adam and Eve are expelled

270
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:08.465
from the Garden of Eden.

271
00:14:09.912 --> 00:14:13.656
And here we have the image of shame,

272
00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:15.363
punishment, right?

273
00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:18.712
They're being sent away in shame and guilt in punishment.

274
00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:20.811
We know that on that day,

275
00:14:20.811 --> 00:14:23.797
Adam and Eve, their cortisol was really flowing

276
00:14:23.797 --> 00:14:28.237
fast and hard because shame, and guilt, and punishment

277
00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:31.529
cut off all of those other biochemicals

278
00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:35.422
that give us the capacity to experience gratefulness,

279
00:14:35.422 --> 00:14:37.353
and love, and forgiveness.

280
00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:41.768
And then we look, you know, in the story of Genesis

281
00:14:41.768 --> 00:14:44.307
it is said that, when they were expelled

282
00:14:44.307 --> 00:14:47.592
from the Garden of Eden, that the angel was sent

283
00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:51.410
to the East Gate, to guard the East Gate

284
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.313
with a flaming sword,

285
00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:57.502
to protect the way back

286
00:14:57.502 --> 00:14:59.742
to the Tree of Life.

287
00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:02.984
And so you can almost look at a certain part

288
00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:06.240
of a whole construct of history

289
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.340
and our biophysiology,

290
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.212
of that armature,

291
00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:14.072
as being outside the East Gate,

292
00:15:14.072 --> 00:15:17.297
the amygdala that rings, that tells us there is danger,

293
00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:18.449
be alert.

294
00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:20.945
We know, for example, we know, we have evidence now,

295
00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:23.114
that our politicians know

296
00:15:23.114 --> 00:15:26.394
about how to hijack and manipulate

297
00:15:26.394 --> 00:15:29.154
our amygdala to create a fear response,

298
00:15:29.154 --> 00:15:31.330
a threat response.

299
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.687
And we know

300
00:15:33.687 --> 00:15:36.492
from our own fight-flight mechanisms

301
00:15:36.492 --> 00:15:39.799
that they can not only serve us for our survival,

302
00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:43.179
but we can start to use them

303
00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:45.159
to control and dominate others.

304
00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:48.512
So outside the Garden of Eden, if you like,

305
00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:51.211
as a mythic image,

306
00:15:52.231 --> 00:15:56.164
you have the body surface response.

307
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:59.483
And now science and spirituality

308
00:15:59.483 --> 00:16:01.123
are going in again

309
00:16:01.123 --> 00:16:05.497
to that Tree of Life and saying the innermost parts

310
00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:10.332
are where love, creativity, gratefulness, forgiveness

311
00:16:10.332 --> 00:16:14.769
exist in the deepest parts of our own being.

312
00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:18.364
That's the place wherein quantum physics

313
00:16:18.364 --> 00:16:20.358
and in so much of these new thoughts,

314
00:16:20.358 --> 00:16:23.526
we begin to see the universe flowing,

315
00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:26.267
where time as we know it dissolves,

316
00:16:26.267 --> 00:16:29.519
where locality as we know it dissolves,

317
00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:34.081
where the imaginal realm becomes very deep and rich.

318
00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:36.209
You know, Einstein said that

319
00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:40.359
imagination is more powerful than knowledge.

320
00:16:40.359 --> 00:16:44.200
So it isn't the tricky,

321
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.564
fantasy,

322
00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:49.613
hamster wheel fantasy

323
00:16:49.613 --> 00:16:52.014
form of imagination that we're talking about.

324
00:16:52.014 --> 00:16:53.944
We're talking about this deep imagination

325
00:16:53.944 --> 00:16:58.426
in the meditative state, in the places where the body

326
00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:02.501
is producing these deeper frequencies

327
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:04.011
and resonances,

328
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:08.526
that we begin to imagine and see the possibilities

329
00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:12.398
that can unfold for us in cosmic reality.

330
00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:17.208
So this is a time when we talk about the re-enchanment

331
00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:18.467
of the cosmos.

332
00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:20.664
Ervin Laszlo wrote a wonderful book called

333
00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:23.361
"The Reenchantment of the Cosmos,"

334
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:26.082
because we have been disenchanted.

335
00:17:26.082 --> 00:17:28.887
We've been separated, somehow,

336
00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:32.097
in a locked materialistic universe,

337
00:17:32.097 --> 00:17:36.120
with God apparently somewhere else in the universe.

338
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.374
<v Interviewer>Ready to punish us.</v>

339
00:17:37.374 --> 00:17:39.406
<v ->Ready to punish us, exactly.</v>

340
00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:40.686
Indeed.

341
00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:44.469
<v Interviewer>So we begin looking at the song</v>

342
00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:47.746
from Orpheus, and we start looking at the symbols

343
00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:51.948
of that, or the vibrations that that would represent,

344
00:17:51.948 --> 00:17:54.263
truth and beauty, inclusivity,

345
00:17:54.263 --> 00:17:57.675
completeness, wholeness, and love.

346
00:17:57.675 --> 00:17:59.564
Now, are those songs?

347
00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:03.980
Those sound to me to be the song that can certainly trump

348
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.699
the adrenaline rush and the harshness and seperation

349
00:18:06.699 --> 00:18:10.785
and hatred of the other once they can be heard.

350
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:12.757
But another point that you brought up,

351
00:18:12.757 --> 00:18:16.288
and, in fact, I almost raised my hand in the audience today

352
00:18:16.288 --> 00:18:18.784
to bring up, is how the light and the dark,

353
00:18:18.784 --> 00:18:21.387
and how these polarities live side by side.

354
00:18:21.387 --> 00:18:25.162
And if I may say what I was going to say then,

355
00:18:25.162 --> 00:18:28.522
to me, I've always been intrigued with the immense amount

356
00:18:28.522 --> 00:18:32.565
of these higher forces that come through people

357
00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:35.711
when they're in the darkest times, like in the trenches

358
00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:37.015
in the middle of war.

359
00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:41.563
The bonding, the love, the courage, the compassion

360
00:18:41.563 --> 00:18:44.486
for each other, that starts surfacing

361
00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:46.747
between comrades in war.

362
00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:48.816
That really seems to end up being the highlight

363
00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:51.600
of their lives because it's the only time these men

364
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.205
were able to access it on such a visceral level.

365
00:18:56.533 --> 00:18:58.849
What is the stance between light and dark?

366
00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:03.506
<v ->Yes, so, in our mythic example</v>

367
00:19:03.506 --> 00:19:07.096
of Ulysses, the Sirens, and Orpheus,

368
00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:10.529
Orpheus becomes the singer of a reality

369
00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:14.560
that is able to save the lives

370
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.441
and to move the ship

371
00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:20.065
beyond the call of the Sirens.

372
00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:23.627
And Orpheus is wholeness.

373
00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:26.571
Orpheus has been to the Underworld,

374
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:28.799
he has visited the Underworld,

375
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:32.606
and he rises out of the Underworld

376
00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:34.376
with a new song.

377
00:19:34.376 --> 00:19:38.697
So there is a mysterious connection

378
00:19:38.697 --> 00:19:41.887
between our suffering and our liberation,

379
00:19:41.887 --> 00:19:45.279
between the forces in the universe

380
00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:49.522
that want to shake us out of our tree,

381
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:53.282
that, in a sense, have to let us know

382
00:19:53.282 --> 00:19:55.799
when we're stuck in a conditioned view,

383
00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:59.639
when we're stuck in a wound, when we're stuck in a place

384
00:19:59.639 --> 00:20:04.186
where there is no vitality or movement, because the universe

385
00:20:04.186 --> 00:20:08.414
and evolution itself is ever dynamic, it's ever in movement.

386
00:20:08.414 --> 00:20:12.744
And so it may take a great wind

387
00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:17.049
to move us, and sometimes that can be suffering.

388
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.035
It can be negative, it can come from trauma.

389
00:20:20.035 --> 00:20:23.309
But it can open us, it can remind us again

390
00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:25.836
that we are on a journey, that there is movement,

391
00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:28.823
that there's dynamism in the universe.

392
00:20:28.823 --> 00:20:32.217
You know, the poet David Whyte

393
00:20:32.217 --> 00:20:34.520
has these wonderful lines.

394
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.150
"Sometimes it takes a great sky,

395
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.383
"Sometimes it takes a great sky

396
00:20:42.383 --> 00:20:46.393
"to find the small and indescribable wedge

397
00:20:46.393 --> 00:20:49.470
"of freedom in your own heart."

398
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.582
And sometimes, the universe does that.

399
00:20:51.582 --> 00:20:53.843
It says, "I am going to be the great sky,

400
00:20:53.843 --> 00:20:57.875
"because your little wedge has gotten too tight."

401
00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:01.375
<v Interviewer>Let's take the example of 9/11.</v>

402
00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:04.543
You've worked on the subject of transformation and peace

403
00:21:04.543 --> 00:21:06.324
for many, many years of your life.

404
00:21:06.324 --> 00:21:08.720
Your involvement with Amnesty International,

405
00:21:11.925 --> 00:21:15.424
not just letting go of, but encouraging governments

406
00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:18.528
of the world to stop cruel and unusual practices

407
00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.323
and punishments of people, both theirs and others.

408
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:23.329
And let's look at 9/11.

409
00:21:24.466 --> 00:21:27.047
There is an interesting opportunity

410
00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:31.961
in this paradigm changing time, in that it gave

411
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:34.348
a great opportunity for compassion.

412
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.048
But the dark side of that, also a great opportunity

413
00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:41.698
for manipulation and control.

414
00:21:41.698 --> 00:21:43.810
Can you speak a little bit to this?

415
00:21:45.427 --> 00:21:49.812
<v ->Yes, 9/11 is a very significant event at many levels.</v>

416
00:21:51.438 --> 00:21:55.728
9/11, as it unfolded,

417
00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:58.650
we saw the world with New York

418
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.745
and the United States, there were people all over the world

419
00:22:02.745 --> 00:22:04.858
who were saying, "We're New Yorkers too,

420
00:22:04.858 --> 00:22:06.542
"This has happened to us."

421
00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:11.407
In fact, in a mysterious way,

422
00:22:11.407 --> 00:22:12.634
it was a unique event

423
00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:15.909
because more representatives from different countries

424
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:19.960
on the world died at one moment than at any other point

425
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.816
that we know of in human history.

426
00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:25.763
So, in effect, it was a global event in that sense,

427
00:22:25.763 --> 00:22:28.867
and people convened around it.

428
00:22:31.527 --> 00:22:35.220
And what happened, if you like, scientifically and medically

429
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.431
to us all, also, at that moment, was that we all

430
00:22:38.431 --> 00:22:40.745
had an amygdala response.

431
00:22:40.745 --> 00:22:43.284
Now the amygdala there in the mid-brain

432
00:22:43.284 --> 00:22:46.665
is designed to raise the alarm, and to tell you

433
00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:49.502
that there is danger or threat, or to be anxious

434
00:22:49.502 --> 00:22:52.392
about something, but it's also right next to the part

435
00:22:52.392 --> 00:22:56.051
of our brain that imprints long term memory.

436
00:22:56.051 --> 00:23:00.877
And so many of us can remember precisely where we were,

437
00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:04.207
what we were doing, when we heard about 9/11.

438
00:23:04.207 --> 00:23:08.050
Now, as 9/11 unfolded,

439
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.720
the human rights community in the world said,

440
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.801
"This was a horrendous criminal act.

441
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:18.832
"Go hunt the criminals. Use international law.

442
00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:21.574
"Use every aspect of international law

443
00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:24.656
"to get at the criminals who are responsible

444
00:23:24.656 --> 00:23:27.685
"for this great and horrible act."

445
00:23:27.685 --> 00:23:30.364
Great in the sense of scale, I mean, a horrible act.

446
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.396
But the course that was taken was not the pursuit

447
00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:37.921
of the criminals.

448
00:23:37.921 --> 00:23:41.612
It was the pursuit of a whole conjunction

449
00:23:41.612 --> 00:23:45.782
of other political motivations that, as we know,

450
00:23:45.782 --> 00:23:48.886
have changed from day one.

451
00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:53.758
And 9/11 has increasingly been used

452
00:23:55.138 --> 00:23:59.941
as a manipulation, as a reference point

453
00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:04.717
repeatedly used in contexts to remind people

454
00:24:04.717 --> 00:24:07.586
to activate the amygdala response,

455
00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:11.476
to activate a fear response when

456
00:24:12.796 --> 00:24:15.834
there are other political motivations involved.

457
00:24:15.834 --> 00:24:19.023
And we have some distortion effect there.

458
00:24:19.023 --> 00:24:22.788
And as those elements have unfolded,

459
00:24:22.788 --> 00:24:26.458
that embrace of the United States,

460
00:24:26.458 --> 00:24:28.687
that incredible moment on the planet

461
00:24:28.687 --> 00:24:30.884
when so many people came together,

462
00:24:30.884 --> 00:24:35.876
now has dissolved to a sense of suspicion and distrust of,

463
00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:38.006
"What are those motivations?

464
00:24:38.006 --> 00:24:42.688
"Why is 9/11 now being used in these other ways?"

465
00:24:42.688 --> 00:24:45.468
And so we have something that,

466
00:24:47.088 --> 00:24:51.497
those of use who are working on expanding our consciousness

467
00:24:51.497 --> 00:24:55.445
and waking up have to be able to look at these realities,

468
00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:59.200
not enter them so much

469
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.980
that they consume us,

470
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.422
that we live in the conspiracy, or we live

471
00:25:03.422 --> 00:25:08.337
in trying to understand the motivations of others,

472
00:25:08.337 --> 00:25:13.122
but we have to recognize them, recognize in the field,

473
00:25:13.122 --> 00:25:17.783
this is a distorted pattern, and how do we,

474
00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:21.559
in our great journey, move around the attraction,

475
00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:25.750
the pull of those patterns, towards, again,

476
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.078
that global embrace, that moment when human beings

477
00:25:29.078 --> 00:25:33.014
around the world will come together in solidarity

478
00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:34.464
around suffering?

479
00:25:34.464 --> 00:25:37.920
That is something that we need to pursue,

480
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.485
and dialogue, I believe, is the modality to take us there.

481
00:25:42.485 --> 00:25:46.349
How do we engage in dialogue with each other?

482
00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:47.765
<v Interviewer>And this is something that</v>

483
00:25:47.765 --> 00:25:49.621
you key in on a lot, dialogue,

484
00:25:49.621 --> 00:25:51.656
and a method of communication.

485
00:25:51.656 --> 00:25:54.441
And one of the people you have referred to

486
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:56.404
whose work is so important is Marshall Rosenberg

487
00:25:56.404 --> 00:25:58.484
with nonviolent communication,

488
00:25:58.484 --> 00:26:01.481
and some of the questions that are asked.

489
00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:03.856
Can you speak to that for a moment as well?

490
00:26:03.856 --> 00:26:06.543
So we can start getting an idea, as individuals

491
00:26:06.543 --> 00:26:08.922
in our own homes, in our own families, our own groups,

492
00:26:08.922 --> 00:26:11.663
communities, and so forth, of the kinds of questions

493
00:26:11.663 --> 00:26:14.664
we need to ask to begin turning

494
00:26:14.664 --> 00:26:18.244
this bittersweet event and period of time

495
00:26:18.244 --> 00:26:20.570
in our lives into an opportunity

496
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.959
for genuine alchemical growth.

497
00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:27.286
<v ->Here's an important piece of advice,</v>

498
00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:30.592
a practical piece of advice, if you're ever in a situation

499
00:26:30.592 --> 00:26:32.309
where you're being threatened,

500
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:36.264
where the violence has come to your door.

501
00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:39.234
There is one question

502
00:26:40.362 --> 00:26:45.055
that seems to be able to help diffuse violent intent

503
00:26:45.055 --> 00:26:47.636
or aggression more than any other,

504
00:26:47.636 --> 00:26:50.772
and that's a question that, in a sense,

505
00:26:51.732 --> 00:26:54.098
is respectful to the other.

506
00:26:54.098 --> 00:26:57.426
It's sort of an amazing flip in some ways.

507
00:26:57.426 --> 00:26:59.890
You say to the one who's coming at you,

508
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.110
"What do you need me to understand?

509
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.190
"What do you need me to understand in this moment?"

510
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:12.234
And that question has a way of triggering

511
00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:15.156
a rational response, something that says,

512
00:27:15.156 --> 00:27:18.004
"Well, I need you to understand this. I am angry."

513
00:27:18.004 --> 00:27:21.737
I see, I see. And why are you so angry?

514
00:27:21.737 --> 00:27:25.086
Can you help me understand your anger?

515
00:27:25.086 --> 00:27:29.396
And so, Marshall Rosenberg has looked

516
00:27:29.396 --> 00:27:33.362
at nonviolent communication, and how to begin

517
00:27:33.362 --> 00:27:36.424
to dialogue even in deep distress,

518
00:27:36.424 --> 00:27:39.091
even in moments of danger.

519
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.156
And I believe

520
00:27:41.156 --> 00:27:45.685
that the whole planet

521
00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:46.755
could shift.

522
00:27:46.755 --> 00:27:49.363
That's a big statement, it's a bold statement,

523
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:51.636
to say that the whole planet could shift

524
00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:56.628
if we began modalities of dialogue that said to the other,

525
00:27:56.628 --> 00:27:59.112
to the one who is framed as the enemy,

526
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:03.353
"What are you really trying to get me to understand here?"

527
00:28:03.353 --> 00:28:05.358
<v Interviewer>I can feel the truth in that.</v>

528
00:28:05.358 --> 00:28:07.939
You have lived with this personally in your work.

529
00:28:07.939 --> 00:28:09.805
You've had to do work where this question

530
00:28:09.805 --> 00:28:12.450
has had to be asked in some dicey situations.

531
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.771
Can you share some of that with us?

532
00:28:16.087 --> 00:28:20.087
<v ->I lived in Beirut in 1982 and '83</v>

533
00:28:20.087 --> 00:28:23.382
when Beirut was bombed,

534
00:28:23.382 --> 00:28:26.272
and the war occurred.

535
00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:31.271
And then the PLO were sent out,

536
00:28:31.271 --> 00:28:34.074
and then the Israelis invaded West Beirut.

537
00:28:34.074 --> 00:28:38.926
There were a whole sequence of complex historical occasions

538
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:42.436
that I won't go into here, but at one point,

539
00:28:42.436 --> 00:28:45.322
there was also a massacre

540
00:28:45.322 --> 00:28:47.802
in the Palestinian camps,

541
00:28:47.802 --> 00:28:51.056
the Sabra, Shatila camps, and I sometimes say,

542
00:28:51.056 --> 00:28:55.887
if I were graphing my life, that the low point,

543
00:28:55.887 --> 00:28:59.290
the point where the darkness was so palpable,

544
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.599
was in Beirut during that period of the massacres,

545
00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:08.111
because, you know, I could experience the war,

546
00:29:08.111 --> 00:29:10.180
and the bombing, and the fear,

547
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.476
but to actually be close to a situation

548
00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:17.315
where whole families were massacred around the table,

549
00:29:17.315 --> 00:29:20.217
where they found children murdered under the beds,

550
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:23.587
in hallways, in toilet rooms, on the threshold,

551
00:29:23.587 --> 00:29:25.823
on the doorsteps of their houses,

552
00:29:27.073 --> 00:29:32.049
the vivid nature of the diseased hatred

553
00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:37.045
that caused that massacre left me at a dark spot,

554
00:29:38.245 --> 00:29:40.348
at a point where I wondered,

555
00:29:41.788 --> 00:29:44.903
"Is humanity really recoverable?"

556
00:29:44.903 --> 00:29:49.010
And shortly after that, I went to a camp

557
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.846
that had been completely destroyed in the bombing,

558
00:29:51.846 --> 00:29:53.638
south of Beirut.

559
00:29:53.638 --> 00:29:56.242
And there was an old man in the rubble,

560
00:29:56.242 --> 00:30:00.625
and I was with some medical teams from England and Sweden,

561
00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:03.516
and we were walking through the camp,

562
00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:07.761
and this old man waved to us, shouting,

563
00:30:07.761 --> 00:30:09.446
"Come and have coffee."

564
00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:14.533
And we said no, and then he repeated it.

565
00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:18.672
And we came over, there was slab of concrete

566
00:30:18.672 --> 00:30:21.478
that used to be the roof of his house, and he pulled out

567
00:30:21.478 --> 00:30:25.954
a Calor gas stove and started to make, in the Arabic style,

568
00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:27.589
the coffee.

569
00:30:27.589 --> 00:30:31.441
And he didn't talk about

570
00:30:31.441 --> 00:30:34.192
who had killed his relatives.

571
00:30:34.192 --> 00:30:38.982
What he wanted us to see was the indestructible nature

572
00:30:38.982 --> 00:30:40.816
of the human being.

573
00:30:40.816 --> 00:30:44.368
He wanted desperately for us to see his dignity.

574
00:30:45.548 --> 00:30:47.777
And we witnessed that dignity.

575
00:30:47.777 --> 00:30:49.910
That was the moment of my recovery,

576
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.555
because I saw that the spirit,

577
00:30:52.555 --> 00:30:55.787
the spirit of the human is indestructible in that sense.

578
00:30:55.787 --> 00:31:00.298
No bomb, no massacre can even take that away.

579
00:31:00.298 --> 00:31:04.160
That we have a destiny beyond these catastrophic

580
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.861
and disastrous events in our lives.

581
00:31:07.861 --> 00:31:10.582
And so I'm truly a human being who has looked

582
00:31:10.582 --> 00:31:15.519
into the dungeons of the world for ten years in Amnesty,

583
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:18.570
every day, waking up to stories

584
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.516
of torture and killings.

585
00:31:22.516 --> 00:31:25.398
And yet,

586
00:31:25.398 --> 00:31:28.459
I am one who is deeply hopeful

587
00:31:28.459 --> 00:31:30.518
that there is a new configuration,

588
00:31:30.518 --> 00:31:32.983
there is a new mindset arising,

589
00:31:32.983 --> 00:31:35.702
that out of this evolutionary trauma,

590
00:31:35.702 --> 00:31:40.523
we are rising with a new sense of the dynamic relationship

591
00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:44.096
between our inner life, our hopes, our beliefs,

592
00:31:44.096 --> 00:31:47.103
our attitudes, and how it affects our health,

593
00:31:47.103 --> 00:31:49.407
our communities, our families,

594
00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:53.205
and that we truly have the possibility, in this race

595
00:31:53.205 --> 00:31:57.701
for the planet with all the ecological challenges

596
00:31:57.701 --> 00:32:02.587
that face us, we have an opportunity to reconfigure

597
00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:06.181
the whole human enterprise in ways that will truly,

598
00:32:06.181 --> 00:32:08.059
I believe, astonish us.

599
00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:11.563
<v Interviewer>I'm so happy to hear</v>

600
00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:13.857
this hope coming from you in particular,

601
00:32:13.857 --> 00:32:16.544
because of what you've witnessed in your lifetime.

602
00:32:17.994 --> 00:32:20.085
When you talk about the transformation,

603
00:32:20.085 --> 00:32:21.728
the definition you give of this,

604
00:32:21.728 --> 00:32:25.695
because hopefully, this exact indomitable spirit,

605
00:32:25.695 --> 00:32:29.238
the true spirit, is going to be what's going to take us

606
00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:31.301
into this genuine transformation.

607
00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:33.083
And the way you describe it is the liberation

608
00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.982
of consciousness from constriction

609
00:32:35.982 --> 00:32:38.852
of identity or belief.

610
00:32:38.852 --> 00:32:40.457
That's very succinct.

611
00:32:40.457 --> 00:32:43.285
So what is going to free our consciousness

612
00:32:43.285 --> 00:32:44.948
from this kind of constriction

613
00:32:44.948 --> 00:32:46.613
that we find ourselves amidst?

614
00:32:46.613 --> 00:32:49.197
From all the forces that are bombarding us?

615
00:32:50.398 --> 00:32:54.782
<v ->We have discovered that we are in an irreversible story.</v>

616
00:32:54.782 --> 00:32:58.195
Evolution is an irreversible arrow.

617
00:32:58.195 --> 00:33:02.600
And in our story, we now see earth, our home,

618
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.405
our collective home, in the balance,

619
00:33:05.405 --> 00:33:06.974
that she is threatened.

620
00:33:06.974 --> 00:33:10.066
Her oceans, the skies, the level of pollution,

621
00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:12.211
the loss of species.

622
00:33:12.211 --> 00:33:16.669
So now we are looking not just at the survival

623
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:20.177
and the fate of our family, of our tribe, of our group,

624
00:33:20.177 --> 00:33:23.901
of our nation, but we're looking at a greater whole.

625
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:28.690
And so transformation is always this movement

626
00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:32.252
within the self, within the community,

627
00:33:32.252 --> 00:33:35.803
within the whole of the earth itself,

628
00:33:35.803 --> 00:33:40.017
towards something greater, more whole, more inclusive.

629
00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:43.142
And it is because we belong in this cosmos,

630
00:33:43.142 --> 00:33:46.821
because we are a part of cosmic reality,

631
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:50.373
that we can, in fact, remember,

632
00:33:50.373 --> 00:33:53.264
"Yes, I am greater than that,

633
00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:55.803
"that which I thought I was,

634
00:33:55.803 --> 00:33:58.102
"that which I define myself as,

635
00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:01.302
"often in a wounded way."

636
00:34:01.302 --> 00:34:04.119
Even in whole societies that say,

637
00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:07.233
"Our true meaning is about the wounds we carry

638
00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.875
"from the past."

639
00:34:08.875 --> 00:34:11.926
That we can liberate ourselves and discover

640
00:34:11.926 --> 00:34:16.108
something that unifies, that connects, that interconnects.

641
00:34:16.108 --> 00:34:20.598
Science is looking at the interconnections at the vast level

642
00:34:20.598 --> 00:34:23.535
of the quantum reality.

643
00:34:23.535 --> 00:34:26.552
Medicine is looking at the wholeness of the body,

644
00:34:26.552 --> 00:34:29.743
the spirit, mind, body connect.

645
00:34:29.743 --> 00:34:34.457
Even down to genetics, the field of epigenetics,

646
00:34:34.457 --> 00:34:36.441
which is the field that is looking

647
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:40.366
at what switches on and off the genes,

648
00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:43.064
the positive genes and the negative genes,

649
00:34:43.064 --> 00:34:47.438
beginning to look at our core attitudes and beliefs

650
00:34:47.438 --> 00:34:50.215
as very instrumental

651
00:34:50.215 --> 00:34:53.895
in switching on and off our genes.

652
00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:56.277
So there we have,

653
00:34:56.277 --> 00:34:59.737
the story of transformation

654
00:34:59.737 --> 00:35:03.682
is that story that brings us to a greater and greater

655
00:35:03.682 --> 00:35:05.007
sense of wholeness.

656
00:35:05.007 --> 00:35:09.380
And some would say, "When we've matured as a species.

657
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.463
"We're at the edge of the galaxy, maybe, for a reason,

658
00:35:12.463 --> 00:35:15.017
"maybe until we grow up." (laughs)

659
00:35:15.017 --> 00:35:15.914
<v Interviewer>(laughs)</v>

660
00:35:15.914 --> 00:35:17.251
That has been said,
<v James>That maybe,</v>

661
00:35:17.251 --> 00:35:20.535
the reality, that sense

662
00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:24.235
that it isn't

663
00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:28.171
a dry series of empty worlds out there,

664
00:35:28.171 --> 00:35:31.446
that there is a whole reality waiting for us.

665
00:35:31.446 --> 00:35:35.286
There's a sense of, we're always called by that notion

666
00:35:35.286 --> 00:35:39.729
of something more whole, more vastly interconnected

667
00:35:39.729 --> 00:35:42.000
than we at first conceived.

668
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.435
<v Interview>Well, my entire being can feel the truth</v>

669
00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:47.973
and the beauty in your words.

670
00:35:47.973 --> 00:35:52.464
And at this point, is there any final thought

671
00:35:52.464 --> 00:35:55.002
that would like to impart right now,

672
00:35:55.002 --> 00:35:56.436
beyond what you've said?

673
00:35:57.914 --> 00:36:01.039
<v ->A few months ago, I went to the Sierra Madres,</v>

674
00:36:01.039 --> 00:36:05.614
to Santa Marta, the highest coastal mountain in the world,

675
00:36:05.614 --> 00:36:10.425
and on this mountain, there's a very mysterious people.

676
00:36:10.425 --> 00:36:13.198
They're known to the West as the Kogi,

677
00:36:13.198 --> 00:36:15.950
but there are actually four peoples on the mountain.

678
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.705
The Kogi, the Arhuaca, the Wiwa, and the Kankuamo.

679
00:36:19.705 --> 00:36:22.062
Now, in their belief, or their myth,

680
00:36:22.062 --> 00:36:24.707
or however you want to relate to that,

681
00:36:24.707 --> 00:36:29.406
they actually believe they are a remnant from Atlantis.

682
00:36:29.406 --> 00:36:33.838
And they have an extraordinary,

683
00:36:33.838 --> 00:36:37.998
probably one of the most extraordinary oral traditions

684
00:36:37.998 --> 00:36:41.411
on the planet, because their spiritual elders

685
00:36:41.411 --> 00:36:45.642
spend the first nine years of their lives inside a cave

686
00:36:45.642 --> 00:36:50.629
getting cosmological instruction about the whole story,

687
00:36:50.629 --> 00:36:53.989
the big story, and they trace that through Atlantis

688
00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.653
to the current time.

689
00:36:55.653 --> 00:37:00.268
And they, in the last twenty years, have been saying

690
00:37:00.268 --> 00:37:02.473
to the rest of the world that they refer to

691
00:37:02.473 --> 00:37:06.420
as "Little Brother," not in any derogatory sense,

692
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.937
but as simply younger in time,

693
00:37:08.937 --> 00:37:12.126
that they are elder, meaning they have a record

694
00:37:12.126 --> 00:37:14.196
in time that goes back further.

695
00:37:15.247 --> 00:37:18.372
They've been saying that the earth is in danger,

696
00:37:18.372 --> 00:37:21.401
that there are imbalances,

697
00:37:21.401 --> 00:37:26.401
that there is potentially very vast ecological devastation.

698
00:37:26.403 --> 00:37:30.222
And yet, they look at all of this,

699
00:37:30.222 --> 00:37:32.909
some people refer to them as the Buddhist monks

700
00:37:32.909 --> 00:37:36.603
of the indigenous people, they look at all of this

701
00:37:36.603 --> 00:37:40.119
in terms of the patterns, the waveforms, the patterns.

702
00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:44.513
They are highly developed in terms of their telepathic

703
00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:47.233
and pattern-reading skills.

704
00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:49.429
And so they look, and they say,

705
00:37:49.429 --> 00:37:53.291
"Ah, look. Here's where the pattern is out of balance."

706
00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:56.214
Not, "Here's where you are wrong.

707
00:37:56.214 --> 00:37:59.467
"Here's what you did wrong. Here's where the blame is."

708
00:37:59.467 --> 00:38:02.208
But, "Here's where the pattern is uneven,"

709
00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:07.208
and the whole patterns that they see

710
00:38:07.214 --> 00:38:10.185
emerging on the planet at this time.

711
00:38:10.185 --> 00:38:13.471
Because I believe that awareness that they hold

712
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:17.150
is an ancient, it's a once and future awareness,

713
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.710
it's the capacity in awareness to see

714
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.249
what is out of balance, and the very depth

715
00:38:22.249 --> 00:38:25.582
of that objective seeing

716
00:38:25.582 --> 00:38:28.092
helps restore the balance.

717
00:38:28.092 --> 00:38:30.363
The judgement, the blaming, the shaming,

718
00:38:30.363 --> 00:38:32.678
the finding the enemy, the wrong guy, the person

719
00:38:32.678 --> 00:38:35.226
who's not in the club, the person who should be expelled,

720
00:38:35.226 --> 00:38:39.856
that is going to continue to create further distortions,

721
00:38:39.856 --> 00:38:44.079
but the awareness, the nonjudgemental awareness itself,

722
00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:48.025
is the ultimate act of non-denial,

723
00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:50.906
it's the act of seeing, of knowing.

724
00:38:50.906 --> 00:38:54.607
And in that deep knowing, the balance can be restored.

725
00:38:55.776 --> 00:38:58.230
And that's, I think, work for all of us.
