00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:02.331
<v ->There's no issue more vulnerable</v>

2
00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:05.040
to the giggle factor than that of alien abduction,

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.749
which is why I've waited until this time to present it.

4
00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:10.149
When I first came in contact with Kim Carlsberg

5
00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.420
I felt an authenticity coming from her

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.671
regarding her experience with eight years

7
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.549
of abduction by the Greys.

8
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.543
For those who haven't resonated with the subject

9
00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:20.847
until now, I ask you to keep an open mind

10
00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:23.743
while watching this conversation.

11
00:00:36.192 --> 00:00:37.632
<v Voiceover>First off, Kim, I have to tell you, this is</v>

12
00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:39.092
an absolutely beautiful book.

13
00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:42.302
I see why it's been getting really positive comments

14
00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:43.903
from people.

15
00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.797
And I think you've done a real service

16
00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:52.442
for people who are both intrigued with the subject

17
00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:56.047
and who've had so much direct experience with it themselves.

18
00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:58.180
Because this is sort of a panoply of every kind

19
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.584
of experience and every kind of being from other places,

20
00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:04.653
other dimensions, other planets.

21
00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:05.817
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

22
00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Voiceover>And illustrated so beautifully.</v>

23
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.849
It's like the most intriguing coffee table book

24
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.525
I've ever seen. (laughs)

25
00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.423
<v ->The cosmic coffee table book--</v>

26
00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.194
<v Voiceover>Exactly, exactly.</v>

27
00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.700
It's called The Art of Close Encounters.

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.747
And we were talking off-camera and I think

29
00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.786
that that's a really important distinction to make,

30
00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.174
because there's that whole abduction phenomena

31
00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:26.008
and there is a chapter on that, and then

32
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:27.544
there's the close encounter phenomena,

33
00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:29.614
which can be any range of things.

34
00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:31.960
But let's go to your own experience

35
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.690
and when this whole subject first came

36
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.929
into your awareness.

37
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.624
<v ->Sure.</v>

38
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:39.917
I was working in Hollywood as a photographer.

39
00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:43.939
I was the first woman photographer in the Cameramen's Union.

40
00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.051
So now called the Camera Person's Union,

41
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.784
or the Camera Union, but I had been living

42
00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:53.431
with my boyfriend on the beach in Malibu,

43
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:55.426
and there's this beautiful old--

44
00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.079
We called it the pink castle.

45
00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.682
This historic building that is on the corner

46
00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:02.647
of Sunset Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway.

47
00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:04.811
And it has these three arched windows,

48
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:09.388
beautiful Spanish windows that overlook the ocean.

49
00:02:09.388 --> 00:02:12.609
And we had the bottom floor of this building.

50
00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.721
And so I came home one night

51
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.344
and I was relaxing.

52
00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:19.137
Because we had the bottom floor

53
00:02:19.137 --> 00:02:22.870
we literally lived in one room, so I tried to be

54
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.565
very quiet because Greg always got up

55
00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:28.111
very early in the morning to work out.

56
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:29.536
So I came home and I pulled a chair up

57
00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.570
into the window and I put my feet in the window sill.

58
00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:37.706
And I noticed a light on the horizon and it was

59
00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:42.559
too bright to be a star and it was too low to be a star.

60
00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.017
And it was too far above the horizon to be a boat.

61
00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:50.202
And I've looked at that ocean a million times

62
00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:51.387
so I'm sitting there going, "This is intriguing,

63
00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.381
"What is this?"

64
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:56.421
And then within a matter of a second

65
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:59.673
boom, boom, it goes from the South Bay,

66
00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:01.744
which would be Palos Verdes, where we are,

67
00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:05.477
to Point Dume in the blink of an eye.

68
00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.261
And I realized that the way it moved,

69
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.871
at that kind of speed, if I tried to wake up

70
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.207
my boyfriend by the time he got to the window

71
00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:14.212
it would have been gone.

72
00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:15.421
<v Voiceover>So you could have a witness</v>

73
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:17.138
to validate this experience. (laughs)

74
00:03:17.138 --> 00:03:21.537
<v ->Yeah, to share it with, it was phenomenal.</v>

75
00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:24.839
So as if it responded to my thoughts

76
00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.857
that I was looking at it, it took another

77
00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:29.233
(snaps fingers)

78
00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:32.252
flash and it was right in front of my window.

79
00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:34.342
It was about 50 feet in diameter.

80
00:03:34.342 --> 00:03:37.564
It was a white, glowing orb.

81
00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:39.452
I call it Moon over Malibu.

82
00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.766
It looked like the moon with a little--

83
00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:44.437
the moon in fog.

84
00:03:45.253 --> 00:03:48.710
And I had the sense that there were entities inside.

85
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.453
I could almost see a silhouette of two entities

86
00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:54.997
but it was very vague.

87
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.561
So I sat there staring at this thing,

88
00:03:57.561 --> 00:04:00.293
not knowing, (laughs) I said in my book,

89
00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:03.877
if I was about to see God or the Devil.

90
00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.617
I had no idea what it was and what the experience

91
00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.196
was going to be.

92
00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:10.863
And the next thing I know this thing just shot away

93
00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:13.458
the diagonal to the stars.

94
00:04:15.364 --> 00:04:16.623
So that was fine.

95
00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.265
I had my first sighting.

96
00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:20.312
I wasn't sure what that was.

97
00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:23.117
And a few weeks later I went to bed as usual,

98
00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:24.494
and I woke up.

99
00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.161
I was not in my bed, I was in what I now believe

100
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.312
was the inside of a craft.

101
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.920
And I was completely conscious.

102
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.756
I was naked, I was paralyzed.

103
00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:39.666
My nose was pressed against a cold metal door.

104
00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:41.837
To my left--

105
00:04:41.837 --> 00:04:44.322
All I could move were my eyes.

106
00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:47.063
So I'm trying to do this, "Where am I?

107
00:04:47.063 --> 00:04:48.982
"What's going on?"

108
00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:52.311
And to my left was one of my very first boyfriends,

109
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:54.955
and he was naked and paralyzed.

110
00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:57.248
And he was very unconscious.

111
00:04:57.248 --> 00:04:59.084
He looked completely dazed.

112
00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:02.593
And I knew that I was crowded by other bodies

113
00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:06.511
into what seemed like an elevator.

114
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:11.691
To the left of him I knew there was another woman,

115
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:13.526
and I only knew it telepathically.

116
00:05:13.526 --> 00:05:16.800
It was my first experience with telepathy.

117
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.839
I knew that she was a makeup artist.

118
00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.677
And at that point, this metal door that I thought

119
00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:26.804
was an elevator opens up into a huge room

120
00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:29.685
with hundreds of tables that were a couple of feet

121
00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:31.353
off the floor.

122
00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:35.891
And they were all occupied with unconscious human beings.

123
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:39.304
And there were these little tiny white creatures

124
00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:42.242
running around.

125
00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:44.692
I believe probably hundreds of them as well.

126
00:05:44.692 --> 00:05:46.846
They seemed to be everywhere.

127
00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.171
One would be at the head of one of the human beings

128
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:50.930
doing something to the head, one would be

129
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.971
doing something to the wrists.

130
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:56.232
And I thought that these people were dead,

131
00:05:56.232 --> 00:05:58.600
and I was absolutely terrified, and I thought

132
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.983
I was gonna be next.

133
00:06:01.223 --> 00:06:03.122
I had never heard of alien abduction.

134
00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:05.704
I had never heard of the greys at that point.

135
00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:07.143
I was a latchkey kid.

136
00:06:07.143 --> 00:06:08.786
I worked my way through eight years of college.

137
00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:12.114
I didn't watch tv and movies, and so--

138
00:06:12.114 --> 00:06:13.457
<v Voiceover>You weren't prone to fantasy.</v>

139
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:14.961
<v ->Right.</v>

140
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:16.870
So in '88 this was not common knowledge

141
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.491
like it is now.

142
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.840
Everyone knows what a Grey is now, but at the time

143
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.278
I coined them the Anorexic Pillsbury Doughboys.

144
00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:29.499
<v Voiceover>Yeah, tiny and pale, the kids.</v>

145
00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.499
<v ->So at that point I was terrified.</v>

146
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:37.979
I started screaming and there were two

147
00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.953
taller Greys standing to my right.

148
00:06:40.953 --> 00:06:42.765
One came up and slapped me on the back

149
00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:44.599
of the neck and the other one stood

150
00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.531
right in front of my face, just waiting

151
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.739
for me to go unconscious.

152
00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:50.242
And the slap on the back of the neck

153
00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:53.516
was exactly like I had been given anesthesia.

154
00:06:53.516 --> 00:06:56.184
Because I've had operations before

155
00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:58.978
and I know that feeling, and that drugged feeling

156
00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:02.476
came over me and I knew I was completely helpless.

157
00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:05.701
And I really thought that that was going to be my death.

158
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.072
I became conscious later on, in another small room

159
00:07:11.072 --> 00:07:15.109
that was dim, I saw no lighting.

160
00:07:15.787 --> 00:07:20.725
I was on a metal table, sitting there by myself.

161
00:07:20.725 --> 00:07:22.539
There was an Anorexic Pillsbury Doughboy (laughs)

162
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.160
sitting to my left.

163
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.624
And there was an arched window--

164
00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:28.437
Excuse me, an arched door.

165
00:07:28.437 --> 00:07:30.486
When I looked through the door it was

166
00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:34.219
a very brightly lit room, but I couldn't

167
00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.053
see any detail.

168
00:07:36.053 --> 00:07:38.751
And at that point a being walked into

169
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.716
the arched doorway and stood there.

170
00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:46.334
And she was backlit and her hair was very patchy.

171
00:07:46.334 --> 00:07:50.373
It was blond and patchy and about shoulder length.

172
00:07:50.373 --> 00:07:53.232
And at that point I thought, "This woman's undergoing

173
00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:56.270
"radiation treatment for cancer."

174
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.026
Because that's what it looked like, the patchy hair.

175
00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:04.440
And I realized it was a female and I started screaming

176
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.364
out to her, I said, "What's going on?"

177
00:08:07.364 --> 00:08:09.475
I said, "Can't you see how terrified I am?

178
00:08:09.475 --> 00:08:12.013
"You're a woman, can you help me?"

179
00:08:12.013 --> 00:08:16.450
And she stood there with this blank face,

180
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.383
although she did have human features, huge eyes.

181
00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.690
She was a hybrid, now we know--

182
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.971
<v Voiceover>Right, I was getting that.</v>

183
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:25.805
<v ->that she was a hybrid.</v>

184
00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:29.933
And telepathically she said to me, "Why don't you stop being

185
00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:33.697
"such a big baby and this will be over with soon enough."

186
00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:36.738
And that shocked me out of my hysteria.

187
00:08:36.738 --> 00:08:39.734
I don't know if it was her plan, but it did.

188
00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.702
And I said, "Okay, what does that mean?"

189
00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:46.738
And the next thing I know, I'm back in my bed.

190
00:08:46.738 --> 00:08:49.182
My boyfriend is still in the exact same position

191
00:08:49.182 --> 00:08:52.637
he was in when I went to bed, and it was starting

192
00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:55.123
to get light, and I knew that he would be up to

193
00:08:55.123 --> 00:08:57.843
go work out at any moment.

194
00:08:57.843 --> 00:09:00.273
And so I just laid there pretending to be asleep

195
00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:01.693
because I didn't know how to explain

196
00:09:01.693 --> 00:09:03.452
what had happened.

197
00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:05.852
<v Voiceover>How much time had elapsed, do you think?</v>

198
00:09:05.852 --> 00:09:07.453
<v ->Probably a few hours.</v>

199
00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:09.213
<v Voiceover>A few hours, okay.</v>

200
00:09:09.213 --> 00:09:12.251
And for you, I mean some people with really lucid dreams,

201
00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:14.631
say, would question themselves and say,

202
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:16.039
"Was that just a dream?"

203
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.267
What were your thoughts after this?

204
00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.708
Did you have these kinds of questions?

205
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.084
<v ->Sure I did.</v>

206
00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:22.801
What else could it be?

207
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:24.165
It was a nightmare.

208
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:26.929
It was a horrible, lucid nightmare.

209
00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:30.673
So at that point I was working on a video with--

210
00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:35.734
I always get this wrong, Shalane McCall from Dallas,

211
00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:37.770
and I'd been working with a producer

212
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.575
for three or four days into this shoot,

213
00:09:40.575 --> 00:09:43.946
and he was from Kansas City where I was from.

214
00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:47.317
And so we became fast friends.

215
00:09:47.317 --> 00:09:50.516
And I just had to continue life, and I say that

216
00:09:50.516 --> 00:09:53.695
at that point it was like another me showed up

217
00:09:53.695 --> 00:09:57.002
to live my life, because I was in absolute shock,

218
00:09:57.002 --> 00:09:59.156
but I still went about my days.

219
00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:02.057
I did what had to be done, but the world,

220
00:10:02.057 --> 00:10:05.864
the universe that I knew was gone.

221
00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:09.000
And I was like an alien in this universe

222
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.931
with what had happened to me.

223
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:14.942
So I went to work that day and my friend Gary

224
00:10:14.942 --> 00:10:17.726
walks up to me and said, "What happened to you?"

225
00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.635
And I said, "What do you mean?" (laughs)

226
00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:22.238
And he said, "Kimberley, 'cause you look terrible."

227
00:10:22.238 --> 00:10:23.955
And I said, "I'm sorry."

228
00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:25.341
And he said, "What happened?"

229
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:27.763
I said, "I just had a bad nightmare last night."

230
00:10:27.763 --> 00:10:28.808
And he said, "Well come on."

231
00:10:28.808 --> 00:10:31.155
He goes, "Let's go over to the corner of the set.

232
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:32.477
"I have plenty of time for you.

233
00:10:32.477 --> 00:10:33.842
"If you need me let's talk about it,

234
00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.751
"because dreams mean things

235
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:38.813
"and maybe we can find out what this nightmare meant."

236
00:10:38.813 --> 00:10:42.556
And when I explained it to him, his eyes were just huge,

237
00:10:42.556 --> 00:10:44.134
and his mouth dropped, and he said,

238
00:10:44.134 --> 00:10:46.129
"Kimberley, that wasn't a nightmare.

239
00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:48.476
"That's called 'alien abduction.'"

240
00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:50.076
And I said, "What are you talking about?"

241
00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:51.281
And he said, "Well, I know about this

242
00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:53.691
"because it happened to my roommate."

243
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:55.228
And he said, "So what we're gonna do is,

244
00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:56.902
"you just relax today.

245
00:10:56.902 --> 00:11:00.357
"We're gonna cut down the shoot early

246
00:11:00.357 --> 00:11:01.798
"and I'll take you to the Bodhi Tree Bookstore

247
00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:04.069
"in L.A., and I'm gonna get you a couple of books

248
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:07.024
"and you can study and find out what happened to you."

249
00:11:07.024 --> 00:11:08.880
So that's what we did.

250
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.320
And that was the beginning of eight years

251
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.735
of constant contact, of which I kept diary entries,

252
00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:16.100
that eventually became my first book,

253
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.404
Beyond my Wildest Dreams.

254
00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:20.677
<v Voiceover>And over the eight years,</v>

255
00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:23.438
if you can encapsulate the general nature

256
00:11:23.438 --> 00:11:25.742
of the experiences, number one.

257
00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:28.942
Number two, was it always the same kind of beings

258
00:11:28.942 --> 00:11:33.560
that you were in contact with, or did they change over time?

259
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.043
Just give us a little idea of what happened

260
00:11:35.043 --> 00:11:37.298
over those eight years.

261
00:11:37.347 --> 00:11:41.549
<v ->The first year I lived in absolute terror</v>

262
00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:44.153
because I had no idea what was going on

263
00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:46.675
and every experience was different.

264
00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:49.299
It was typically the Greys.

265
00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:51.858
My first experience I saw light beings that were

266
00:11:51.858 --> 00:11:55.943
about nine feet tall, waterfalls of light

267
00:11:55.943 --> 00:11:59.254
that were standing next to the two taller Greys.

268
00:12:00.626 --> 00:12:03.068
I had a very intimate relationship with a praying

269
00:12:03.068 --> 00:12:06.406
mantis being that I absolutely despised.

270
00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:07.708
It seemed to be the one with the most power

271
00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:10.130
and dominance.

272
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.646
I had an experience with a Grey, I call him

273
00:12:12.646 --> 00:12:15.013
"the big-nosed Grey," and that was

274
00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:16.911
a very loving experience.

275
00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:20.698
So what happened, and there are many more

276
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:23.481
entities that I was involved with over the years.

277
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:27.013
The first few years were terrifying

278
00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:28.783
and I'd always been a meditator, and I'd always

279
00:12:28.783 --> 00:12:33.783
had a little bit of extra ESP and a little extra power.

280
00:12:33.913 --> 00:12:36.100
And I didn't know where it came from.

281
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.580
I suspect probably from my earlier contacts with them.

282
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.881
But I had the feeling that I could

283
00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:45.497
make the experiences stop, but I didn't want them to stop,

284
00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:47.470
because I wanted to understand everything I could

285
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.422
about the phenomenon first.

286
00:12:49.422 --> 00:12:52.206
<v Voiceover>This is not an uncommon feeling, is it?</v>

287
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:54.275
Where on one hand, I've read this from other people

288
00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:55.831
who have been through this--

289
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:58.872
Where on one hand they're frightened, but on another

290
00:12:58.872 --> 00:13:03.170
it's so intriguing and essential to who they are now

291
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.911
that they can't-- they don't want to stop it.

292
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:07.137
<v ->Sure.</v>

293
00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:09.858
You can't live a normal life knowing you have

294
00:13:09.858 --> 00:13:14.858
this secret life, and not wonder every moment

295
00:13:15.307 --> 00:13:18.859
that you're in the world, "What is this world?

296
00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:20.716
"What is this universe?"

297
00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:23.063
And now that I know that this is happening

298
00:13:23.063 --> 00:13:25.996
I just wanna know more, I wanna know more,

299
00:13:25.996 --> 00:13:29.451
and it was worth the pain.

300
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:33.835
So after a couple of years I had a real good idea

301
00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:37.017
what they were doing with me.

302
00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:39.808
It had to do with the hybridization process.

303
00:13:39.808 --> 00:13:43.572
They were using my DNA and creating these hybrid children.

304
00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.940
And I would be implanted--

305
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.184
This is always the tough part to talk about,

306
00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.189
but I have to say the truth.

307
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:52.789
And the truth is, I would be abducted

308
00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:56.734
and I would be implanted with an alien fetus.

309
00:13:56.734 --> 00:13:59.908
I don't know how long it would stay in by body,

310
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.679
but I was a vegan vegetarian for 25 years,

311
00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:07.710
so athletes, females, stop their cycles when they're

312
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.109
that thin and they're athletic.

313
00:14:10.109 --> 00:14:12.009
So I never paid attention to my cycles

314
00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:14.473
because I didn't have them.

315
00:14:14.473 --> 00:14:15.913
And so people would always ask me,

316
00:14:15.913 --> 00:14:17.159
"Well, how long was it in your body?

317
00:14:17.159 --> 00:14:19.879
"Didn't you notice that you weren't having your cycle?"

318
00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:23.155
And I'd say, "No, that just wasn't part of it."

319
00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:24.360
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it's not like you'd balloon up</v>

320
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.661
over nine months or anything.

321
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:27.656
It wasn't that same kind of experience, I assume.

322
00:14:27.656 --> 00:14:29.585
<v ->Yeah, nothing like that.</v>

323
00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:30.749
And because the aliens are so tiny

324
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:32.466
and the fetuses are so tiny, and they leave it in

325
00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:35.462
for such a short time, most people don't know

326
00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:37.335
that it's happening.

327
00:14:38.087 --> 00:14:39.825
So I would be brought back on the ship and I would

328
00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:44.693
be asked to breastfeed these tiny, tiny little babies.

329
00:14:45.148 --> 00:14:47.207
And I'd say, "But, you don't understand.

330
00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:48.273
"I can't do that." (laughs)

331
00:14:48.273 --> 00:14:49.392
And they'd say, "No, you don't understand.

332
00:14:49.392 --> 00:14:51.484
"You can."

333
00:14:51.484 --> 00:14:54.203
So it was all very ambiguous.

334
00:14:54.203 --> 00:14:56.753
They would bring me into these rooms with--

335
00:14:56.753 --> 00:14:59.536
There was a room with tiny little baskets

336
00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:04.390
with tiny babies, and I'd be taken into chambers

337
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.444
with tanks of water with babies floating in the water,

338
00:15:08.632 --> 00:15:10.275
older babies and--

339
00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:15.275
that weren't born yet, and then they would be born.

340
00:15:16.344 --> 00:15:19.149
And then I would be introduced to toddlers.

341
00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:20.664
<v Voiceover>Were they all hybrids?</v>

342
00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:22.209
<v ->They were all hybrids, yes.</v>

343
00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:23.650
<v Voiceover>So they had human characteristics?</v>

344
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.991
<v ->They were more human than they were alien, absolutely.</v>

345
00:15:27.991 --> 00:15:31.553
Yes, and the child that I have the strongest bond with--

346
00:15:31.553 --> 00:15:34.380
I write about her in both of my books, her name is April,

347
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.493
and the last time I saw her she was about 13.

348
00:15:37.493 --> 00:15:40.396
She was an absolute clone of me, other than she

349
00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:42.550
was thinner and had paler skin.

350
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.994
And her intellect was far, far superior than mine.

351
00:15:45.994 --> 00:15:47.637
And I always thought, she must be embarassed

352
00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:49.771
that I'm her mother because she's so smart.

353
00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:51.264
(Both laugh)

354
00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:53.580
And I'm so ignorant compared to the Greys

355
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.172
and her intelligence.

356
00:15:56.172 --> 00:15:59.702
But she has a beautiful intellect, beautiful emotion,

357
00:15:59.702 --> 00:16:04.702
sensitivity, an amazing being.

358
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.139
So with all the pain that I went through it's--

359
00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:10.781
people always ask me, "Was it negative,

360
00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:13.310
"was it positive?"

361
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.703
I always say that I wish that it hadn't happened,

362
00:16:17.703 --> 00:16:20.253
because it did destroy my personal life.

363
00:16:20.253 --> 00:16:21.768
Everything that I had worked for.

364
00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:24.200
Changed my life completely.

365
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.714
And it was very, very painful.

366
00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:29.362
But when I see the product of what they've done

367
00:16:29.362 --> 00:16:34.098
it's amazing and so maybe the ends justify the means.

368
00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:35.740
<v Voiceover>Well, let me ask you about that.</v>

369
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.481
When you say painful, okay, let's say,

370
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:39.739
pretend we're old.

371
00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:43.334
Let's say that it had not been terrifying, number one.

372
00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:46.192
Let's say that the fear hadn't been involved.

373
00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:47.889
What about the rest of it?

374
00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:51.739
Was it physically painful, the things that you

375
00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:53.392
were put through for the most part?

376
00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:57.424
<v ->Yes, extremely physically painful.</v>

377
00:16:57.424 --> 00:16:59.493
I had female problems my whole life,

378
00:16:59.493 --> 00:17:01.210
terrible female problems.

379
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.535
And I've been to doctor after doctor,

380
00:17:03.535 --> 00:17:07.760
and no one could figure out what was going on.

381
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.760
And I am sure that it had to do with being implanted.

382
00:17:12.825 --> 00:17:15.887
I have several experiences, one I wrote about in my book,

383
00:17:15.887 --> 00:17:18.973
that just proves it.

384
00:17:21.156 --> 00:17:25.518
And the pain of having children that you can't see,

385
00:17:25.518 --> 00:17:26.542
that you love--

386
00:17:26.542 --> 00:17:27.779
<v Voiceover>Did you feel a natural bond?</v>

387
00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:30.008
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

388
00:17:31.108 --> 00:17:35.577
You know, it's interesting because my conscious experiences

389
00:17:35.577 --> 00:17:40.478
didn't start until '88, and so I know that I had had

390
00:17:40.478 --> 00:17:44.072
an ongoing relationship with these children,

391
00:17:44.072 --> 00:17:47.880
especially April, because it was so painful

392
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.880
the last time I saw her that I couldn't be with her,

393
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.449
that I was dying inside.

394
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.849
My heart was breaking.

395
00:17:56.849 --> 00:17:59.954
And she's so telepathic and so intuitive

396
00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.671
that she was catching on to that.

397
00:18:01.671 --> 00:18:05.650
I was trying not to cry, I was trying to mask my thoughts

398
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.527
because they're telepathic.

399
00:18:07.527 --> 00:18:09.778
"It's so good to see you, it's so wonderful to see you."

400
00:18:09.778 --> 00:18:10.982
In the back of my mind, I'm going,

401
00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:12.892
"I'm dying because I can't have you in my life

402
00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.908
"and I can't protect you and take care of you.

403
00:18:14.908 --> 00:18:17.414
"And I don't know what your life is going to be like

404
00:18:17.414 --> 00:18:18.977
"in this current environment."

405
00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:22.368
And she got scared and this telepathy

406
00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:25.109
going back and forth between us was,

407
00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:29.099
I could see, she's thirteen, she's vulnerable,

408
00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:31.819
and she pictured her own future children

409
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.324
and thought, "What if that happens to me?

410
00:18:34.324 --> 00:18:37.023
"What if I have children and they're taken from me?

411
00:18:37.023 --> 00:18:40.201
"Will I feel the same kind of pain that you're feeling?"

412
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:43.125
And I tried to tell her telepathically, I said,

413
00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:44.225
"All the pain in the world,"

414
00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:45.432
I'm gonna choke up--

415
00:18:45.432 --> 00:18:49.815
"All the pain in the world isn't--

416
00:18:49.815 --> 00:18:54.815
"it's worth it to experience that kind of love."

417
00:18:55.298 --> 00:18:56.695
So.

418
00:18:58.887 --> 00:19:00.355
<v Voiceover>And this was happening to the other women</v>

419
00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:02.029
in there, too, I take it, right?

420
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:04.142
This is what that program you were involved with

421
00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:05.589
was about.
<v ->Yes.</v>

422
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.601
<v Voiceover>Why are they doing this?</v>

423
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:10.737
What are these hybrid beings being hybridized for?

424
00:19:10.737 --> 00:19:11.879
<v ->I don't know.</v>

425
00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:12.754
They don't tell me.

426
00:19:12.754 --> 00:19:15.291
They don't talk to me, but they communicate.

427
00:19:15.291 --> 00:19:17.680
And when they communicate, they communicate

428
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.648
in what I call virtual reality experiences.

429
00:19:21.648 --> 00:19:25.670
I will wake up and I will be in a scenario

430
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.890
that is absolutely lifelike and I will have to live through

431
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.142
some kind of event.

432
00:19:31.142 --> 00:19:33.211
And then at the end of this event, when they're gotten

433
00:19:33.211 --> 00:19:35.578
what they wanted out of me, or they've taught me

434
00:19:35.578 --> 00:19:38.459
what they wanted me to learn, this scenario

435
00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:40.367
just completely dissolves and I'll be sitting

436
00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:43.946
in a room with some Grey aliens.

437
00:19:43.946 --> 00:19:45.727
<v Voiceover>Like holographic reality.</v>

438
00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:46.570
<v ->Graphic reality?</v>

439
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.635
<v Voiceover>Holographic.</v>
<v ->Holographic?</v>

440
00:19:47.635 --> 00:19:48.584
<v Voiceover>When you're right</v>

441
00:19:48.584 --> 00:19:49.704
in the middle of it,

442
00:19:49.704 --> 00:19:50.952
It's real to you.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

443
00:19:50.952 --> 00:19:54.546
So I don't know why they're creating the children.

444
00:19:54.546 --> 00:19:56.072
All I can do is speculate.

445
00:19:56.072 --> 00:19:58.002
But most of my experiences,

446
00:19:58.002 --> 00:20:02.417
many of my experiences are about the earth.

447
00:20:02.417 --> 00:20:05.990
And I have been quoted, it's a long quote

448
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.681
but the last sentence is the one that stays with me,

449
00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:14.183
that it is time to save Mother Earth from her inhabitants.

450
00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:17.201
So I don't know what that means.

451
00:20:17.201 --> 00:20:18.801
We can all speculate.

452
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.660
Either we're bad and we're gonna go away

453
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.589
and the hybrids might come here.

454
00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:25.350
Or the hybrids might be integrating

455
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:30.118
to help us higher our consciousness.

456
00:20:30.118 --> 00:20:33.218
Or the Greys, this may be just what they do.

457
00:20:33.218 --> 00:20:36.323
They may seek planets, because they're

458
00:20:36.323 --> 00:20:39.341
definitely good at what they do.

459
00:20:39.341 --> 00:20:42.712
I've seen hybrid children that were 90 percent human

460
00:20:42.712 --> 00:20:45.590
and 10 percent alien and everything in between.

461
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:50.590
I've seen every combination of race amongst those beings.

462
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.535
<v Voiceover>When you say every race amongst those beings,</v>

463
00:20:56.535 --> 00:20:59.969
are you talking about their various forms,

464
00:20:59.969 --> 00:21:02.965
or hybridized with us and our races

465
00:21:02.965 --> 00:21:04.960
injected into their species.

466
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.572
<v ->Yes, all of our races combined with their DNA.</v>

467
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.658
<v Voiceover>One of the things you said a moment ago</v>

468
00:21:15.658 --> 00:21:17.599
is they would teach you things and show you things.

469
00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:19.774
What were some of the more profound things

470
00:21:19.774 --> 00:21:22.312
you learned with them or you saw

471
00:21:22.312 --> 00:21:26.142
in these holographic realities created for you.

472
00:21:26.142 --> 00:21:27.854
<v ->Sure.</v>

473
00:21:29.673 --> 00:21:31.176
This one in particular wasn't really

474
00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:33.842
a holographic experience, but this was the most profound

475
00:21:33.842 --> 00:21:37.650
thing that I took away.

476
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.181
I had just had surgery for my female problems

477
00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:43.922
(laughs) and I was in bed for a few days,

478
00:21:43.922 --> 00:21:46.130
so they were around a lot.

479
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:50.684
I had a female being come visit me a lot

480
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.731
during that time.

481
00:21:52.731 --> 00:21:54.811
She had huge eyes.

482
00:21:54.811 --> 00:21:57.041
Her eyes, I thought they were a foot in diameter,

483
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:59.014
they were so big.

484
00:21:59.014 --> 00:22:01.520
And she had a scarf that she had wrapped

485
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.356
around the bottom of her face, so all I could see

486
00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:04.625
were her eyes.

487
00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:06.214
<v Voiceover>Was she like the rest of them?</v>

488
00:22:06.214 --> 00:22:08.069
<v ->She was not like the rest of them.</v>

489
00:22:08.069 --> 00:22:13.069
She was, I would say she was more like a hybrid,

490
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.026
but a more perfected, a more evolved hybrid.

491
00:22:20.283 --> 00:22:22.480
And she had a scarf around her face, so I couldn't

492
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.181
see her hair, she just wanted me to see the eyes.

493
00:22:26.181 --> 00:22:28.549
And that's how they usually connect.

494
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:30.447
So she got right in front of my face,

495
00:22:30.447 --> 00:22:33.486
and she said, "You are us."

496
00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:36.900
And at that moment I felt myself to be one with her,

497
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.087
one with the Greys, one with the universe,

498
00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:42.733
one with God, one with everything.

499
00:22:42.733 --> 00:22:46.212
So they gave me the ultimate spiritual experience

500
00:22:46.212 --> 00:22:51.160
of my life, so it's the ying and yang,

501
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.597
the yin and yan of the encounter experience.

502
00:22:55.597 --> 00:22:58.403
They taught me many spiritual lessons.

503
00:22:58.403 --> 00:22:59.896
<v Voiceover>Can you share a couple?</v>

504
00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:02.162
<v ->Sure, let's see.</v>

505
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.645
Okay, this is a good one.

506
00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:07.202
I was taken to a place a couple of times

507
00:23:07.202 --> 00:23:09.740
that I believe was another planet.

508
00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:14.081
It was an orange, dry desert-type planet

509
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:18.558
and there were three male pilots

510
00:23:18.558 --> 00:23:23.130
piloting three triangular craft

511
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.337
and they were showing me

512
00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:27.386
how they cloaked themselves.

513
00:23:27.386 --> 00:23:29.219
So one of the craft came forward.

514
00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:31.790
I was all alone and this craft came forward

515
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.883
and it shot a white fabric out in front of it

516
00:23:34.883 --> 00:23:36.835
that looked like parachute material.

517
00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:39.247
And I thought, "Oh, they're gonna float down or something."

518
00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:42.681
But this parachute material enveloped the craft

519
00:23:42.681 --> 00:23:45.122
and turned soft and it looked like a cloud.

520
00:23:45.122 --> 00:23:46.350
So I understood that they were showing me

521
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.986
how they cloaked themselves.

522
00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:50.742
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

523
00:23:52.977 --> 00:23:57.733
I have to explain that a lot of these experiences

524
00:23:57.733 --> 00:24:01.403
are not linear the way we experience time.

525
00:24:01.403 --> 00:24:06.374
In my experience I will have an abduction or a contact

526
00:24:06.374 --> 00:24:08.677
and it will have all the complete components

527
00:24:08.677 --> 00:24:11.972
of an experience but they're not exactly linear.

528
00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:15.801
They break up but they all make sense at the end.

529
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:19.076
So in this experience, the craft went away.

530
00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:22.831
I looked off to the side and these three pilots

531
00:24:22.831 --> 00:24:26.692
were now on the ground, walking towards me.

532
00:24:26.692 --> 00:24:29.961
And I looked at one and I knew him.

533
00:24:30.521 --> 00:24:34.724
But I didn't know how, it was absolute knowing.

534
00:24:34.724 --> 00:24:39.724
He was in his 30s, good looking, Nordic-type guy

535
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.738
and he had this sweet energy about him like,

536
00:24:43.738 --> 00:24:46.948
"I know you know me, we know each other."

537
00:24:46.948 --> 00:24:50.591
And I thought, "Okay, but why don't I have the memories?"

538
00:24:51.643 --> 00:24:55.493
So the next thing I know a bulldozer shows up,

539
00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:59.481
this big bulldozer with this big round thing on the front.

540
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:01.252
I guess it reminds me of something

541
00:25:01.252 --> 00:25:04.964
that you would lay tarmac out with.

542
00:25:04.964 --> 00:25:07.268
So this comes up from the left

543
00:25:07.268 --> 00:25:09.892
and these three pilots walk over in front

544
00:25:09.892 --> 00:25:14.201
of this bulldozer and they lie down in front of it.

545
00:25:14.201 --> 00:25:16.825
And the bulldozer goes over them,

546
00:25:16.825 --> 00:25:19.481
and I'm absolutely terrified, horrified, couldn't believe

547
00:25:19.481 --> 00:25:20.803
what I was seeing.

548
00:25:20.803 --> 00:25:24.413
I said, "This is horrific!"

549
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.363
And I'm at the height of this emotion

550
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.409
and the bulldozer moves on away,

551
00:25:34.409 --> 00:25:36.169
and there's nothing left

552
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:41.169
but these little plastic or glass shards on the dirt.

553
00:25:41.235 --> 00:25:43.699
And I walked over and I picked one up,

554
00:25:43.699 --> 00:25:45.970
and as I did, a voice said to me,

555
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.683
"This is to show you the body is only a shell."

556
00:25:49.683 --> 00:25:52.893
And then it disappeared in my hand.

557
00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:54.419
<v Voiceover>Wow! (laughs)</v>

558
00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.656
<v ->So that's how they communicate.</v>

559
00:25:55.656 --> 00:25:56.861
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah.</v>

560
00:25:56.861 --> 00:25:59.272
<v ->They would never just tell me something like that.</v>

561
00:25:59.272 --> 00:26:00.391
I had to live it.

562
00:26:00.391 --> 00:26:01.757
<v Voiceover>You had to live it, which, of course,</v>

563
00:26:01.757 --> 00:26:03.336
is how we all learn best.

564
00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:05.681
So it was an intelligent way to teach.

565
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:07.371
<v ->Right.</v>

566
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:09.628
<v Voiceover>Well, the book that you've written,</v>

567
00:26:09.628 --> 00:26:11.377
this new one that's just coming out.

568
00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:13.457
In fact, it's on the docks as we speak.

569
00:26:13.457 --> 00:26:14.898
<v ->(laughs) And I'm here to pick it up.</v>

570
00:26:14.898 --> 00:26:17.008
<v Voiceover>And you're here to pick it up.</v>

571
00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:19.782
The Art of Close Encounters, you show many different

572
00:26:19.782 --> 00:26:21.361
kinds of beings.

573
00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:25.247
Now, how did this project come out of your experiences?

574
00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:29.233
<v ->I'm a photographer and I'm visual.</v>

575
00:26:29.233 --> 00:26:31.600
My first book was my diary entries

576
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.267
and I had a good friend of mine illustrate most of them,

577
00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:36.847
I illustrated some of them.

578
00:26:36.847 --> 00:26:38.277
So at the end of that book I put out

579
00:26:38.277 --> 00:26:40.560
an invitation for people who had had experiences

580
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.065
who had art and if they would like to contribute

581
00:26:43.065 --> 00:26:46.201
I wanted to do a compilation of other people's experiences

582
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:47.566
and art.

583
00:26:47.566 --> 00:26:51.333
Well, that was 15 years ago, and I received enough

584
00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:54.276
for a chapter, but not for a book.

585
00:26:54.276 --> 00:26:56.719
And at that time I was having a very difficult time

586
00:26:56.719 --> 00:27:00.548
in my life personally because of coming forward.

587
00:27:00.548 --> 00:27:03.641
And one day I had been on so many television shows

588
00:27:03.641 --> 00:27:05.421
and radio shows and on and on, and I was talking,

589
00:27:05.421 --> 00:27:08.557
talking, and I never took a dime for anything.

590
00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:11.481
I just wanted to get the information out.

591
00:27:11.481 --> 00:27:13.294
I got to the point where I couldn't talk any more.

592
00:27:13.294 --> 00:27:15.032
And that's when I decided to write my book.

593
00:27:15.032 --> 00:27:16.567
I said, "I'm gonna write my book.

594
00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:18.339
"I'm gonna give it to the world, and I'm gonna go away

595
00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:20.237
"and try to retrieve my life."

596
00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:21.885
So I did.

597
00:27:22.488 --> 00:27:26.114
So I was gone for 15 years and about a year and a half ago

598
00:27:26.114 --> 00:27:29.645
I went on Facebook as myself,

599
00:27:29.645 --> 00:27:32.247
as Kim Carlsberg the photographer,

600
00:27:32.247 --> 00:27:35.447
and the first day I was busted.

601
00:27:35.447 --> 00:27:36.396
"You're Km Carlsberg."

602
00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:37.676
<v Voiceover>People knew who you were.</v>

603
00:27:37.676 --> 00:27:40.139
<v ->Everyone knew who I was, and I started receiving</v>

604
00:27:40.139 --> 00:27:42.880
all these beautiful, wonderful letters from people,

605
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.540
emails and messages for the contribution I'd made

606
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.193
with my first book.

607
00:27:48.193 --> 00:27:50.518
So I got sucked back in.

608
00:27:50.518 --> 00:27:52.331
And I realized that I was at the perfect point

609
00:27:52.331 --> 00:27:53.814
to finish the book.

610
00:27:53.814 --> 00:27:56.181
I knew that I would finish it someday.

611
00:27:56.181 --> 00:27:59.295
15 years later here I am on Facebook

612
00:27:59.295 --> 00:28:03.167
and I have a whole beautiful community of contactees

613
00:28:03.167 --> 00:28:05.097
at my fingertips, and I said,

614
00:28:05.097 --> 00:28:08.319
"You guys, if you have any art, if you have a story--"

615
00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:11.178
Now is the time for me to finish

616
00:28:11.178 --> 00:28:12.734
the Art of Close Encounters.

617
00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:14.452
<v Voiceover>There's some amazing artwork in here.</v>

618
00:28:14.452 --> 00:28:18.931
<v ->And I was saying that I needed to wait 15 years</v>

619
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:21.789
to have this book be as powerful as it is,

620
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:24.691
because 15 years ago we didn't have the software

621
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:28.040
that we have now for creating artwork.

622
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.040
And anyone with any artistic ability at all

623
00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:35.676
can go on and find software and put together

624
00:28:35.676 --> 00:28:38.739
a pretty good image.

625
00:28:38.739 --> 00:28:43.016
So the images are phenomenal.

626
00:28:43.016 --> 00:28:45.447
I can say I love the book and it's amazing

627
00:28:45.447 --> 00:28:48.605
and it's beautiful, because I didn't do it.

628
00:28:48.605 --> 00:28:53.352
It's 150 individual stories of close encounters.

629
00:28:54.918 --> 00:28:57.659
<v Voiceover>And it's not all painful abductions.</v>

630
00:28:57.659 --> 00:28:59.356
<v ->No, not at all.</v>

631
00:28:59.356 --> 00:29:01.008
<v Voiceover>It's close encounters, which is a distinction.</v>

632
00:29:01.008 --> 00:29:02.864
<v ->Yes, this is not the art of abduction,</v>

633
00:29:02.864 --> 00:29:05.093
this is the Art of Close Encounters.

634
00:29:05.093 --> 00:29:07.664
And it covers every type of close encounter

635
00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:10.085
that I could get my hands on.

636
00:29:10.085 --> 00:29:14.308
So you have beautiful stories of people who were mentored

637
00:29:14.308 --> 00:29:18.841
from childhood, you have stories that just--

638
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:23.795
Most of it is actually very positive and very powerful.

639
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:26.127
I was asked the other night on a radio show,

640
00:29:26.127 --> 00:29:29.518
"Tell me the most terrifying story in the book,"

641
00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:32.151
and I said, "Come to think of it, there really aren't

642
00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:34.358
"any terrifying stories in the book."

643
00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:36.631
Because in this day and age, 15 years later,

644
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:38.618
there's so much information out there,

645
00:29:38.618 --> 00:29:40.986
people know what a Grey is, people know what abduction is,

646
00:29:40.986 --> 00:29:44.240
and if it's happening to them they can find out about it

647
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.608
quickly and they can get the information they need.

648
00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:49.523
And they can assimilate it.

649
00:29:50.692 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Voiceover>So what's the most beautiful</v>

650
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.475
story in the book, instead of scary?

651
00:29:56.036 --> 00:29:58.009
<v ->Oh, there are so many.</v>

652
00:29:58.009 --> 00:29:59.354
<v Voiceover>Well, maybe just one or two</v>

653
00:29:59.354 --> 00:30:01.533
that pop to mind.

654
00:30:03.022 --> 00:30:06.969
<v ->Oh, goodness, Tonia Madenford.</v>

655
00:30:06.969 --> 00:30:10.872
I like this one because it involves children.

656
00:30:10.872 --> 00:30:13.913
And she has a very lighthearted--

657
00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:16.909
She's a beautiful woman, she lives in Phoenix,

658
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:18.531
and we talked on the phone for a couple hours

659
00:30:18.531 --> 00:30:19.906
and I just loved her energy.

660
00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:21.251
And she didn't wanna come forward.

661
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.384
She didn't wanna contribute, but after we talked

662
00:30:23.384 --> 00:30:25.518
for a while she goes, "Well ..."

663
00:30:25.518 --> 00:30:26.988
I said, "Come on, we need to get this information

664
00:30:26.988 --> 00:30:30.114
"out in the world, and you've had a great story."

665
00:30:30.114 --> 00:30:31.884
And she says, "Okay, well let me see

666
00:30:31.884 --> 00:30:33.740
"if I can get the artist--"

667
00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.702
She had another artist illustrate her story.

668
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:43.295
And it's called Rising, I believe.

669
00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:47.211
It's a blue craft and it's three little children

670
00:30:47.211 --> 00:30:49.548
and they're reaching up into the blue light.

671
00:30:49.548 --> 00:30:51.520
And she talks about how she was mentored

672
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.478
as a child and how they told her

673
00:30:55.478 --> 00:31:00.384
that the earth was

674
00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:02.336
the most important planet

675
00:31:02.336 --> 00:31:05.290
because it seeded other planets.

676
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.724
And she said that she felt from a very young age

677
00:31:08.724 --> 00:31:13.724
this, like I was told, we have to take care of Mother Earth.

678
00:31:16.163 --> 00:31:17.325
<v Voiceover>This seems to be a common theme.</v>

679
00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:18.136
<v ->Yeah.</v>

680
00:31:18.136 --> 00:31:19.384
<v Voiceover>From everything I've read.</v>

681
00:31:19.384 --> 00:31:20.856
<v ->It was great because she just talks</v>

682
00:31:20.856 --> 00:31:22.892
about walking out into the field and all the kids

683
00:31:22.892 --> 00:31:26.167
getting together and waiting for the craft to come over.

684
00:31:26.167 --> 00:31:28.695
And it was so exciting when they would float up

685
00:31:28.695 --> 00:31:31.970
into the craft and be taken into these rooms.

686
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.178
And she said sometimes they would be told

687
00:31:34.178 --> 00:31:36.780
what to do, and sometimes they were just free

688
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.588
to draw and play and be in the craft,

689
00:31:40.588 --> 00:31:43.484
and be dropped off.

690
00:31:43.628 --> 00:31:45.143
So, it's not a very serious story, but it's--

691
00:31:45.143 --> 00:31:47.511
<v Voiceover>No, but that's sweet.</v>

692
00:31:47.511 --> 00:31:49.452
And what did those beings look like?

693
00:31:49.452 --> 00:31:50.549
What kind of beings were they?

694
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:52.331
<v ->You know, she did not describe the beings.</v>

695
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:54.145
She described her experience.

696
00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:55.776
<v Voiceover>Her experience, okay.</v>

697
00:31:55.776 --> 00:31:58.144
So the environment was there for the kids, it sounds like.

698
00:31:58.144 --> 00:32:00.921
<v ->Right, right.</v>

699
00:32:03.243 --> 00:32:04.991
<v Voiceover>We've read about the different types</v>

700
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:06.379
of beings and experiences.

701
00:32:06.379 --> 00:32:07.949
The Greys seem to be very closely aligned

702
00:32:07.949 --> 00:32:10.711
with these kinds of programs you're speaking of,

703
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:13.772
DNA work, hybridizations, and so forth.

704
00:32:13.772 --> 00:32:17.830
What about the ones known as the Nordics, for example?

705
00:32:17.933 --> 00:32:20.651
<v ->There are a lot of Nordics in the book.</v>

706
00:32:20.651 --> 00:32:24.800
I believe, let's see, Nordic stories ...

707
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.048
<v Voiceover>They're the ones that tend to look</v>

708
00:32:26.048 --> 00:32:26.751
more like you.

709
00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:30.133
<v ->Oh, the humanoids, the blonds, the Pleiadians.</v>

710
00:32:30.133 --> 00:32:32.021
<v Voiceover>The beautiful big blue eyes, yeah.</v>

711
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:35.913
<v ->Sure, yeah, they're all in the book.</v>

712
00:32:35.913 --> 00:32:39.359
<v Voiceover>Do those tend to be more positive stories</v>

713
00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:43.626
that happen surrounding the Nordics than your experience,

714
00:32:43.626 --> 00:32:45.482
or can you go by that?

715
00:32:45.482 --> 00:32:47.903
<v ->I'll go by that, and I just want to make one point.</v>

716
00:32:47.903 --> 00:32:49.662
People always say, "Is it positive or negative?"

717
00:32:49.662 --> 00:32:52.190
And I always have to say, "You cannot judge,

718
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.027
"because we can't use those words."

719
00:32:55.027 --> 00:32:56.958
<v Voiceover>Maybe painful versus not painful.</v>

720
00:32:56.958 --> 00:33:00.990
<v ->Yeah, you know, if you're being physically probed</v>

721
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.899
that's painful.

722
00:33:02.899 --> 00:33:05.640
I don't believe any of the Nordic stories are

723
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.650
about probing people,

724
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.325
although there are stories

725
00:33:11.325 --> 00:33:14.886
where the Pleiadians have been seen with the Greys.

726
00:33:14.886 --> 00:33:17.169
And all the different species have been seen together,

727
00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:18.353
just about.

728
00:33:18.353 --> 00:33:21.765
It's pretty incredible how they do know each other,

729
00:33:21.765 --> 00:33:23.920
and hang out every once in a while.

730
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.888
So I don't know what those relationships are in particular,

731
00:33:27.888 --> 00:33:31.924
but they are seen together a lot.

732
00:33:34.042 --> 00:33:37.829
David W. Chase is in the beginning of the book.

733
00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:40.122
The first chapter of the book I wanted it to be just

734
00:33:40.122 --> 00:33:42.885
the different species and then go

735
00:33:42.885 --> 00:33:46.468
into the different types of encounters.

736
00:33:46.468 --> 00:33:49.348
And he's followed this for a long time

737
00:33:49.348 --> 00:33:52.307
and he's an excellent artist.

738
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.468
And he has a being in the book that is

739
00:33:57.468 --> 00:34:00.284
a Grey alien with the body,

740
00:34:00.284 --> 00:34:02.000
with the size of the head,

741
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.136
the shape, the features, covered in grey scales,

742
00:34:05.136 --> 00:34:09.451
with reptilian slanted, slit irises.

743
00:34:10.843 --> 00:34:13.520
So there are some interesting entities in the book

744
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.186
that I had not heard of.

745
00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:17.648
<v Voiceover>I guess the Reptilians have been getting</v>

746
00:34:17.648 --> 00:34:19.695
a fair amount of play the last 20 years

747
00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:21.157
through the work of a number of people we know

748
00:34:21.157 --> 00:34:22.543
and have interviewed.

749
00:34:22.543 --> 00:34:26.052
<v ->Sure, but I had never heard of a Reptilian-Grey hybrid.</v>

750
00:34:26.052 --> 00:34:27.396
<v Voiceover>So even within those species</v>

751
00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:28.751
they're hybridized versions.

752
00:34:28.751 --> 00:34:30.623
<v ->Yes.</v>

753
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:35.694
<v Voiceover>Well, and I think we're at a point in history</v>

754
00:34:35.694 --> 00:34:39.544
where we're, if not already there,

755
00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.614
certainly approaching a point where

756
00:34:41.614 --> 00:34:43.683
I think the human species is going to

757
00:34:43.683 --> 00:34:46.723
have to become comfortable with the fact

758
00:34:46.723 --> 00:34:50.019
that perhaps we are a hybridized species to begin with.

759
00:34:50.019 --> 00:34:52.247
A genetically engineered species,

760
00:34:52.247 --> 00:34:55.084
and even to the point where--

761
00:34:55.084 --> 00:34:58.722
I think about this now and then, that as you look

762
00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:02.390
at the various species, the various races even

763
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.620
around the planet, you start seeing very specific

764
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.343
characteristics of a lot of these ET species

765
00:35:08.343 --> 00:35:10.123
that have been caught in the artwork--

766
00:35:10.123 --> 00:35:11.649
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Voiceover>And you have</v>

767
00:35:11.649 --> 00:35:13.408
to wonder "Were those people primarily influenced

768
00:35:13.408 --> 00:35:16.010
by the Pleiadians, or ... "

769
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:20.116
<v ->You know, when I did this book I'd go into a restaurant</v>

770
00:35:20.116 --> 00:35:21.365
and I'd start looking at people.

771
00:35:21.365 --> 00:35:22.900
(interviewer laughs)

772
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.503
And I could see the ET ancestry.

773
00:35:25.503 --> 00:35:28.083
Absolutely.

774
00:35:28.083 --> 00:35:30.003
And so that's a little side project of mine

775
00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:32.307
that I'm working on, because once you know

776
00:35:32.307 --> 00:35:33.833
all of these different species,

777
00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:36.094
and you know what they look like,

778
00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:40.691
you can observe them in us.

779
00:35:40.691 --> 00:35:43.913
So I have no problem with the idea that

780
00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:48.029
we were seeded here, manipulated.

781
00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:50.067
You know, I always say that I think the hybrids

782
00:35:50.067 --> 00:35:53.277
are just the--

783
00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:57.288
when the homo sapien and the Neanderthal were here

784
00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.474
at the same time.

785
00:35:59.474 --> 00:36:01.649
I believe that the hybrids, if they do come here,

786
00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:03.345
it would be nothing more than that.

787
00:36:03.345 --> 00:36:06.476
Another upgrade of the species.

788
00:36:07.132 --> 00:36:10.087
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I tend to agree with you on that.</v>

789
00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:13.424
And it's just, it doesn't take away from our sovereignty.

790
00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:17.190
Each one of us is a being with a soul, a true self,

791
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.038
that is integrated through this physical vehicle

792
00:36:20.038 --> 00:36:23.643
of all different types on this planet.

793
00:36:23.643 --> 00:36:28.635
And there has to be some kind of psychological shift

794
00:36:28.635 --> 00:36:30.906
that allows humanity to feel comfortable with it

795
00:36:30.906 --> 00:36:34.472
before there will be any serious exploration, I think.

796
00:36:34.472 --> 00:36:35.849
And hopefully it's not gonna be trotted out

797
00:36:35.849 --> 00:36:37.662
more as a fear scenario.

798
00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:42.662
<v ->No, and I think this book</v>

799
00:36:44.177 --> 00:36:46.290
is gonna cross the boundaries

800
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.466
into mainstream, because it is a coffee table book.

801
00:36:48.466 --> 00:36:49.767
<v Voiceover>It is.</v>

802
00:36:49.767 --> 00:36:52.049
<v ->And it's unintimidating, and it's visual,</v>

803
00:36:52.049 --> 00:36:55.622
and everywhere I go I have to fight to get this book back.

804
00:36:55.622 --> 00:36:57.083
Now here's an interesting story.

805
00:36:57.083 --> 00:36:59.312
Yesterday the woman I'm staying with

806
00:36:59.312 --> 00:37:01.584
had a good friend stop by her house

807
00:37:01.584 --> 00:37:03.514
she hadn't seen in 20 years.

808
00:37:03.514 --> 00:37:06.235
But they were best friends their whole life.

809
00:37:06.235 --> 00:37:07.366
Excuse me, no!

810
00:37:07.366 --> 00:37:09.318
She had seen her, but maybe they had been friends

811
00:37:09.318 --> 00:37:11.893
for 20 years.

812
00:37:13.061 --> 00:37:15.909
And Suzanne asked me to share the book.

813
00:37:15.909 --> 00:37:18.309
And I brought it out and the woman opens up the page

814
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:22.234
and she sees the Greys and the hybrid, and she goes,

815
00:37:22.234 --> 00:37:24.485
"Oh, those were the ones that took me

816
00:37:24.485 --> 00:37:26.522
"when I was 14 and took my eggs."

817
00:37:26.522 --> 00:37:28.259
And Suzanne turned around and looked at me,

818
00:37:28.259 --> 00:37:30.095
and looked at her, and she said,

819
00:37:30.095 --> 00:37:32.751
"I've known you 20 years, you're my best friend.

820
00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:35.000
"And you never told me this."

821
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.675
And I said, "See, it's the context."

822
00:37:36.675 --> 00:37:38.200
I said, "We're all here together, it's comfortable.

823
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.621
"There's the book, you flipped the page.

824
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:42.734
"'Oh, yeah, I saw that, I saw this.'"

825
00:37:42.734 --> 00:37:47.734
So it'll be a tool for people who have had experiences

826
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.533
to share it with friends who are on the fence,

827
00:37:51.533 --> 00:37:54.872
or family, and it's also great for anyone

828
00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.109
who's had an experience.

829
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:57.656
Because they're gonna find their experience

830
00:37:57.656 --> 00:37:59.149
in there or something like it.

831
00:37:59.149 --> 00:38:01.068
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

832
00:38:01.068 --> 00:38:03.041
Well, thank you.

833
00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:05.090
I'm glad we were able to connect.

834
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:06.829
But thank you so much for the work you've been doing

835
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:08.087
and for being comfortable enough

836
00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:09.409
to start speaking about it again

837
00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:10.774
after all these years.

838
00:38:10.774 --> 00:38:12.150
You haven't been doing media for a long time.

839
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:13.175
<v ->Right.</v>

840
00:38:13.175 --> 00:38:14.518
<v Voiceover>And I feel very honored</v>

841
00:38:14.518 --> 00:38:17.420
that you feel comfortable enough to talk with us about it.

842
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.743
<v ->You made me feel very comfortable.</v>

843
00:38:18.743 --> 00:38:19.787
Thank you.

844
00:38:19.787 --> 00:38:21.520
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

845
00:38:24.065 --> 00:38:25.984
<v ->Kim has two books out on the subject,</v>

846
00:38:25.984 --> 00:38:28.289
the first being her own diary of her experiences,

847
00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:32.352
titled Beyond my Wildest Dreams, Diary of a UFO Abductee,

848
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:35.179
which you can find on Amazon and other major booksellers,

849
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.716
and her newest book, The Art of Close Encounters,

850
00:38:37.716 --> 00:38:39.658
which you'll need to buy through her website

851
00:38:39.658 --> 00:38:41.941
theartofcloseencounters.com.

852
00:38:41.941 --> 00:38:44.548
I hope you can see this phenomenon in a new light

853
00:38:44.548 --> 00:38:46.896
as the implications are profound.

854
00:38:46.896 --> 00:38:50.605
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

855
00:38:50.605 --> 00:38:55.605
(serene music)
