00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.637
Sometimes, all of the information

2
00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:05.773
that comes crashing into our lives is simply overwhelming.

3
00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:08.140
For some of you, it may even leave you depressed.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.063
No doubt, there is indeed a lot to consider these days.

5
00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:13.367
As an antidote to all of the seriousness,

6
00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.311
one woman has decided we need a good laugh at ourselves,

7
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:18.444
and has taken it on as her life's work

8
00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:21.068
to do spiritually incorrect comedy.

9
00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:23.116
Although deeply spiritual by nature,

10
00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:27.057
Vanda Mikoloski believes laughter is another path to God.

11
00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:33.485 line:15% 
(mid-tempo jazz instrumental)

12
00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.024
How did you end up

13
00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.832
being an enlightenment comedian,

14
00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:44.682
showing at events such as the "What the bleep" conferences

15
00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:48.586
and that, and nonetheless, you say you're a bad girl,

16
00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:50.932
you're a naughty girl sometimes, at the same time.

17
00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:52.276
Let's get into your whole history,

18
00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:54.036
and how you link naughty girl with enlightenment,

19
00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:55.338
and now you're on stage.

20
00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.055
<v ->Oh, my gosh. That's a lot.</v>

21
00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.473
<v ->Yeah.
<v Vanda>Yeah!</v>

22
00:00:58.473 --> 00:00:59.849
<v Regina>How to begin?</v>

23
00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:03.422
<v ->Well, I've always loved the ideas of, you know,</v>

24
00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:05.300
what are we doing here?

25
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.462
Why are we here?

26
00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.737
What is this trap called the human predicament?

27
00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.155
Is it a trap?

28
00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:14.612
Are we just these mechanistic entities,

29
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:18.234
linear, temporal, designed to survive

30
00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:19.368
and then die?

31
00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:21.494
Or, is there something other?

32
00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:23.176
And I've always pondered that.

33
00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:27.526
I was raised in strict Roman Catholicism.

34
00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:31.679
That gave me something that was dogmatic

35
00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.213
and not inclusive of other belief systems,

36
00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:39.392
for me to consider other belief systems, you know?

37
00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:42.095
Then, you know when you're a kid,

38
00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:44.150
how you just marvel at things?

39
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.735
My brother and I, we had plenty of nature around us,

40
00:01:46.735 --> 00:01:50.767
and we could just lie in fields and wonder,

41
00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.318
you know, at the awesome magnificence of all of it.

42
00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:56.196
And I always knew, I think kids kinda know,

43
00:01:56.196 --> 00:02:01.049
that that patriarchal, punitive God figure

44
00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.782
that they were telling me was the creator

45
00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:07.320
and intelligence behind all this, just didn't really,

46
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.589
you know, that didn't fit.

47
00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.637
So I set out on a journey.

48
00:02:10.637 --> 00:02:14.603
I had a rebellious older brother,

49
00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:17.780
we did drugs from a really early age.

50
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.650
So I did acid at around 11.

51
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.362
My brain was so clean that I had a great little acid trip,

52
00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:26.583
and saw that I was one with everything.

53
00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:30.851
And I don't recommend it for all you 11 year olds out there,

54
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:34.902
But it was a sensation, or a sensibility,

55
00:02:34.902 --> 00:02:37.825
that I chased my whole life after that.

56
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.630
It's like, what is that unity that I know is there?

57
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.003
And you never get that sense of

58
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:48.395
"I am whole, complete and perfect", and then forget it.

59
00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:50.112
No matter if you're tripping, or not.

60
00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:52.661
I just knew, oh my god, my parents have been misinformed.

61
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:55.328
They think there's something awry, and there isn't.

62
00:02:55.328 --> 00:02:56.746
I'm perfect.

63
00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:59.669
So, there was that, and then just growing up,

64
00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.111
and watching societal systems,

65
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.925
and you see in the background,

66
00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:07.711
like in the wallpaper of education, religion, everything.

67
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:10.004
Don't be you, because you suck.

68
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:12.489
You know, that's like everywhere in the background.

69
00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.252
In almost any system we have,

70
00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:19.732
any of the largely male-dominated systems that work...

71
00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.078
Not working, you know?

72
00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:24.853
And there's that don't be you because you suck, thing.

73
00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:26.989
<v ->Well, it keeps the money flowing.
<v Vanda>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Regina>If you suck, you have to keep buying more</v>

75
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.878
to bolster yourself.

76
00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.064
<v ->How won't I suck?</v>

77
00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:33.099
<v ->(laughing) Right.</v>

78
00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.328
<v ->How much is that gonna cost? Right, exactly.</v>

79
00:03:36.328 --> 00:03:40.954
So, you know, there's that amazing thing in comedy.

80
00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.895
A lot of comics come from despair,

81
00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:45.572
and depression and pain, and suffering and all that.

82
00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:48.591
And enlightenment, similar thing.

83
00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:52.121
If you notice, the guys like Eckhart Tolle or Byron Katie,

84
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.788
they all hit that point where they were one step away

85
00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:57.667
from suicidal despair and one step away from enlightenment,

86
00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:59.267
and they went that way.

87
00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:01.454
Some of us played on the edges

88
00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:04.099
of the threshold of sanity for a while,

89
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.605
you know, and anesthetized ourselves.

90
00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:07.332
I did.

91
00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:09.048
<v ->Well, you did. Yeah, and that was in New York,</v>

92
00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.015
in the early days in comedy?

93
00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:12.769
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.601
<v Vanda>Yeah. And so I was anesthetizing myself,</v>

95
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.871
very self-destructive behavior,

96
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.309
but hanging out with some really interesting and fun people.

97
00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:24.412
And the body was so resilient in my 20s, you know?

98
00:04:24.412 --> 00:04:25.638
So there's that.

99
00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:29.206
But at some point, you know,

100
00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:32.666
like my boyfriend, Eckhart Tolle, says,

101
00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:36.868
all addictions begin with pain and ultimately end with pain.

102
00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:39.513
The middle part can be really, really fun though.

103
00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.006
I'll tell you, it can be really fun.

104
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.964
Just that part alone, that's really fun.

105
00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:46.617
And it does end with a pain,

106
00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:49.849
and at some point, I said, why am I killing myself?

107
00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.008
At about age 40, I said, why am I...

108
00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:57.112
Like, the idea that there might be an issue

109
00:04:57.112 --> 00:05:01.753
underneath all of this stuff that I'm anesthetizing.

110
00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:05.440
I just one day said, oh, I'm not...

111
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.247
Maybe I'm not just a self-destructive jerk who's...

112
00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:13.465
completely irresponsible.

113
00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:15.363
Maybe I'm anesthetizing

114
00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:18.243
something I don't wanna see in myself.

115
00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:19.779
Something I don't wanna feel.

116
00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.454
You know, and I started doing a lot of work,

117
00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.355
a lot of spiritual work, transformational work,

118
00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:28.068
and I got to...

119
00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:29.517
One of the core things

120
00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:32.226
in my mechanistic knee-jerk personality

121
00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:34.850
is, you know, my brother, who was the love of my life,

122
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.429
died when I was 13.

123
00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:37.869
And then my dad died.

124
00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:38.871
He drowned,

125
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.232
and then my dad died in a car accident a few years later.

126
00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:43.511
Drug-related, alcohol-related.

127
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.922
And I just developed early on,

128
00:05:47.922 --> 00:05:50.752
this defensiveness about,

129
00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:52.225
I don't want my heart to get broken anymore.

130
00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:55.009
I don't want to feel that kind of pain anymore.

131
00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.379
And so I lived my whole life doing that.

132
00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.278
Here I am, 48, not married,

133
00:06:00.278 --> 00:06:01.878
but not by my own choice.

134
00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:03.115
Single.

135
00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:06.070
And so I'm just, at 40, I just for the last eight years

136
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.286
I've been working out some of those issues

137
00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:11.699
that have had me protecting myself for so long.

138
00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.000
<v ->And you really,</v>

139
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.909
you've thrown yourself into it at times, too.

140
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.662
You were with Ramtha, right?
<v Vanda>Mm-hmm.</v>

141
00:06:16.662 --> 00:06:19.229
<v Regina>Spent a good amount of time with her.</v>

142
00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.648
And you were saying off camera,

143
00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:23.378
you're listening to every audio tape and CD in the car,

144
00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:26.194
going here and there, so you were really searching.

145
00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:26.962
<v ->Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:28.679
<v ->This wasn't a passive thing for you.</v>

147
00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:33.234
<v ->Mm-mm. No, I love having those ah-has.</v>

148
00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:34.855
They're my favorite things.

149
00:06:34.855 --> 00:06:37.041
Second only to ha-has.

150
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.460
<v ->Ha-has, right.</v>

151
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.756
What did the ah-has do to your ha-has, by the way?

152
00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:43.281
During that period of time.

153
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:45.094
Did you become like a lot of people

154
00:06:45.094 --> 00:06:47.558
that enter into this search, the journey,

155
00:06:47.558 --> 00:06:49.734
was it a very sobering thing for you?

156
00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:51.387
And did you come out laughing?

157
00:06:51.387 --> 00:06:53.520
Or were you laughing all the way through?

158
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.312
<v ->I found the funny people.</v>

159
00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:57.030
You know, you just find each other.

160
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.821
I was...

161
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.421
Sometimes, in spiritual circles,

162
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:02.651
people can get pretty sacrosanct, you know?

163
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:05.850
And just replace the old religious observances

164
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.568
with the new spiritual disciplines,

165
00:07:07.568 --> 00:07:10.287
and the old religious hierarchy

166
00:07:10.287 --> 00:07:13.111
with the new gurus or whatever.

167
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:16.166
And it's just the same, more of the same thing.

168
00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:19.249
Mistaking the path for the power.

169
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:21.617
And I have a, my coach,

170
00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:24.550
I have a coach and an ex-boyfriend who says,

171
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.915
"Nothing works.

172
00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:29.862
"Nothing works. It's all intention."

173
00:07:29.862 --> 00:07:31.216
It's all what you do, you know?

174
00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:33.189
So you can have your crystals or your this or your that,

175
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:35.269
and you're going to those conscious life expos,

176
00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:37.872
and there's thousands of things, you know?

177
00:07:37.872 --> 00:07:40.080
Gurus, teachers, whatever.

178
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.351
I think you have to actually

179
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.071
see the hypocrisy in a few gurus,

180
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:49.319
get completely-- feel betrayed by them, forgive them,

181
00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.522
and then maybe get on your spiritual path.

182
00:07:52.522 --> 00:07:53.664
<v ->(laughing) Right.</v>

183
00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:55.594
<v ->Give your power away to them completely.</v>

184
00:07:55.594 --> 00:07:56.746
<v ->Right.</v>

185
00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.378
<v ->You know? So I've done a lot of that.</v>

186
00:07:58.378 --> 00:07:59.882
<v ->Yeah, I think most people,</v>

187
00:07:59.882 --> 00:08:01.439
probably most people watching this,

188
00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.135
have done exactly the same thing as well.

189
00:08:03.135 --> 00:08:04.063
<v ->Yeah.</v>

190
00:08:04.063 --> 00:08:05.855
<v ->You know, we tend to want to hang on to something</v>

191
00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:08.127
while we're looking at this in-between place in life.

192
00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:09.823
And so you were...

193
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.446
One of the things I was intrigued with

194
00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:13.886
was your whole journey with Ramtha.

195
00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:15.028
What was that like for you?

196
00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.137
What were you there for?

197
00:08:16.137 --> 00:08:19.117
What were you getting out of all of that?

198
00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:22.980
<v ->Well, Ramtha was the first time</v>

199
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.390
I had heard a cosmology

200
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.619
that there is no ultimate duality in the universe.

201
00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:30.027
And I loved that.

202
00:08:30.027 --> 00:08:31.701
<v ->And that goes back to when you were a kid,</v>

203
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:33.163
when you had your little trip.

204
00:08:33.163 --> 00:08:34.123
<v ->Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:35.445
<v ->When you knew you were one with everything.</v>

206
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:36.554
<v ->Yeah.</v>

207
00:08:36.554 --> 00:08:37.898
<v ->So was she the next time you hooked in with that,</v>

208
00:08:37.898 --> 00:08:38.880
many years later?

209
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.085
<v ->Yeah.</v>

210
00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:41.685
I remember actually lying in a field with my brother,

211
00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:43.381
and saying, there has to be...

212
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:44.757
No one's telling us the truth.

213
00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.983
They're pretending that they know the truth,

214
00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:48.138
and they're putting information down our throats,

215
00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:50.618
and saying this is the truth, believe this.

216
00:08:50.618 --> 00:08:54.313
But none of it explains the vast magnificence of this.

217
00:08:54.313 --> 00:08:57.780
There has to be like a genie,

218
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.069
like a someone.

219
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:01.285
Someone who knows.

220
00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:02.629
There has to be someone who knows.

221
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.922
You know, and just wishing for that.

222
00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:06.576
And then when Ramtha came along,

223
00:09:06.576 --> 00:09:09.650
there was a couple of supernormal things that happened

224
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.311
that had my ears perk up.

225
00:09:12.311 --> 00:09:16.844
You know, I had never had supernormal experiences before.

226
00:09:16.844 --> 00:09:20.374
And then, I was living in New York City.

227
00:09:20.374 --> 00:09:22.091
My brother hands me an audio tape, says

228
00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:24.150
"This is a multi-dimensional entity.

229
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.635
"If you call him into your life..."

230
00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:28.662
Him being the 35,000 year old warrior

231
00:09:28.662 --> 00:09:30.933
who is allegedly channeled by J. Z. Knight,

232
00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:33.184
I don't know what's going on, who knows?

233
00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:37.045
But there's something remarkable there.

234
00:09:37.045 --> 00:09:39.381
And so he said,

235
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:41.642
"If you call him into your life, he'll appear."

236
00:09:41.642 --> 00:09:43.615
And I'm like, yeah, right, whatever.

237
00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:47.679
And so, I'm a waitress on 72nd and...

238
00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:48.810
What was it?

239
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.644
Hamburger, Diane's Hamburgers in New York.

240
00:09:51.644 --> 00:09:54.324
And I go, all right, okay Ramtha,

241
00:09:54.324 --> 00:09:56.852
if you're really there, come into my life, right?

242
00:09:56.852 --> 00:09:59.401
And that day, two guys walk in the restaurant.

243
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:01.118
I was singing. I go,

244
00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:04.030
♫ I need love, love, to help me ease my mind ♫

245
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.769
And they go, and I turn around and go, oh!

246
00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:07.976
Did you come in to see me, or did you come to eat?

247
00:10:07.976 --> 00:10:09.672
And they go, oh, we came in to see you.

248
00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:11.987
And it was just like that kind of fun communication.

249
00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:14.099
And I said, well, we're not open yet,

250
00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:16.051
but just sit down, and I'll get to you.

251
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:19.976
And so I walked up, and I said, isn't that funny,

252
00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:22.066
how when you're in a good mood,

253
00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:24.178
everyone around you seems to be in a good mood.

254
00:10:24.178 --> 00:10:25.501
And this guy goes,

255
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:27.133
"Consciousness is boss."

256
00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:30.515
I go, have you ever heard of Ramtha?

257
00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:32.402
And he goes, "Ramtha's my guru."

258
00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:34.354
And I went, oh my god, oh my god!

259
00:10:34.354 --> 00:10:35.697
One of those, oh my god!

260
00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:39.274
I called him into my life this morning! Very skeptically!

261
00:10:39.274 --> 00:10:41.222
And look, you know?

262
00:10:41.222 --> 00:10:43.569
And so, that was way cool.

263
00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:45.073
This guy and I, he was a musician.

264
00:10:45.073 --> 00:10:46.289
We started seeing each other.

265
00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:50.161
We opened for each other, and that was really cool.

266
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:54.406
And several other remarkable things like that happened,

267
00:10:54.406 --> 00:10:55.824
and I'm like, I gotta pay some attention.

268
00:10:55.824 --> 00:10:59.451
There's something waking me up here.

269
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.146
I don't know what it is.

270
00:11:01.146 --> 00:11:02.416
Is it Ramtha?

271
00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:05.456
Is there some power outside myself? Is it me?

272
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.695
Does Ramtha even exist,

273
00:11:07.695 --> 00:11:10.060
or is it just a consciousness that I create

274
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.727
by perceiving it?

275
00:11:11.727 --> 00:11:14.127
<v ->Right.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

276
00:11:14.127 --> 00:11:16.324
<v Regina>Right. So what happened from that point,</v>

277
00:11:16.324 --> 00:11:18.509
that took you deeper into all of it?

278
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:20.902
<v ->Well, I left New York City,</v>

279
00:11:20.902 --> 00:11:23.307
at the height of my little career there.

280
00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:25.776
I was an emcee at Catch A Rising Star,

281
00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:27.546
dating Bill Maher at the time.

282
00:11:27.546 --> 00:11:29.050
<v ->You were dating Bill Maher?</v>

283
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.117
<v ->Yes, yeah.</v>

284
00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:31.354
<v ->Okay, that's a little,</v>

285
00:11:31.354 --> 00:11:32.282
I don't know if we can talk about that on camera,

286
00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:34.042
but I might just have to ask you a bit about that.

287
00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:35.599
Okay, go ahead.

288
00:11:35.599 --> 00:11:39.332
<v ->Yeah, and everyone thought I was crazy,</v>

289
00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:41.458
but I really thought,

290
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:45.799
I'm gonna choose my spiritual life and go out there.

291
00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:47.599
My brother said, "You can create whatever you want,

292
00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:49.134
"wherever you are."

293
00:11:49.134 --> 00:11:50.393
And I went, hmm.

294
00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:53.038
That's one of those pivotal things an elder tells you,

295
00:11:53.038 --> 00:11:54.713
or something, you know?

296
00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.174
I went, okay.

297
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.467
I'll create whatever I want in the Pacific Northwest.

298
00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.950
And one thing led to the next,

299
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.723
and I'm completely smitten by this teacher.

300
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.408
He was brilliant.

301
00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:06.456
I mean, whatever that entity was

302
00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:08.077
that was coming out of J. Z. Knight.

303
00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:12.504
I sat in lectures where, you know, six hours,

304
00:12:12.504 --> 00:12:16.834
taking four or five different streams of thought,

305
00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:20.409
and then weaving them together at the end with no script,

306
00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:21.779
it was just like...

307
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:25.109
And having them impact you on a-- dimensionally,

308
00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:27.280
like, experientially.

309
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.357
And everyone having the same experience around you.

310
00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:33.813
It's like, hmm, there's something going on here, you know?

311
00:12:33.813 --> 00:12:36.949
Anyway, so I stayed in that school for a long time.

312
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:38.688
And then this urge to create.

313
00:12:38.688 --> 00:12:40.597
I started doing work at, transformational work

314
00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:42.335
at Landmark Education.

315
00:12:42.335 --> 00:12:44.010
And this urge to go out

316
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.239
and really make a difference in the world.

317
00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:50.186
The Ramtha school is really Yelm-centric,

318
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:55.145
and a lot of people, their paradigm is them and their god.

319
00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:57.492
Sitting, doing their disciplines,

320
00:12:57.492 --> 00:13:02.259
and it doesn't include as much community

321
00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:03.582
as much as I like.

322
00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:07.038
I like to think about the difference I'm here to make

323
00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:08.478
on the planet.

324
00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:12.957
You know, and so that's what I'm doing.

325
00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:16.019
You know, I'm funny, I love ha-has, and I love ah-has,

326
00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.024
and I thought, why don't I bring them together?

327
00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:20.296
It's never been done before quite like this.

328
00:13:20.296 --> 00:13:22.173
<v ->No, you're very irreverent.</v>

329
00:13:22.173 --> 00:13:24.178
But the thing is, what's so wonderful about it

330
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.258
is that's what gets people to think about it.

331
00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:28.092
And not only that, it gets people to chill out

332
00:13:28.092 --> 00:13:29.276
about their own,

333
00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:31.836
what they perceive as all those inadequacies, right?

334
00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:32.999
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

335
00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.527
And the spiritually incurrent comics I'm working with,

336
00:13:35.527 --> 00:13:37.873
we're all just filthy.

337
00:13:37.873 --> 00:13:41.350
Nasty. Human, just human as hell.

338
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.953
And it's so good. We curse like truck drivers.

339
00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:45.350
But you know what?

340
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.461
If you can't curse in front of spiritual people,

341
00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:50.986
who can you curse in front of, is what I say.

342
00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:55.429
But no, we're really, that's what's fun about us,

343
00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:57.467
is we're looking at...

344
00:13:57.467 --> 00:14:00.325
Like, holy people are just not that interesting.

345
00:14:00.325 --> 00:14:02.757
Good people are just not that interesting.

346
00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:05.242
And they're not gonna transform the planet.

347
00:14:05.242 --> 00:14:06.479
They're not!

348
00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.935
Because they'll never access Joe or Mary, you know?

349
00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:12.282
They'll never access those people.

350
00:14:12.282 --> 00:14:16.047
Those people will never find themselves in that person

351
00:14:16.047 --> 00:14:18.415
and who they're being, you know?

352
00:14:18.415 --> 00:14:22.062
Like, the more I can access my own humanity,

353
00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:25.102
the more I can cop to being a jerk,

354
00:14:25.102 --> 00:14:26.681
the more I can admit,

355
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:30.198
I'm a liar, a cheat, a whore and a thief,

356
00:14:30.198 --> 00:14:31.672
you know what I mean?

357
00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:35.086
Like today, today I just sent someone an email,

358
00:14:35.086 --> 00:14:39.031
that was giving them advice that they didn't ask for.

359
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:41.304
And then I sent them an email back,

360
00:14:41.304 --> 00:14:44.534
and I said, I'm sorry, I just gave you unsolicited advice.

361
00:14:44.534 --> 00:14:46.509
All of a sudden, the whole world opens up

362
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:48.462
between me and this person.

363
00:14:48.462 --> 00:14:50.807
And I'm vulnerable, and I'm just human.

364
00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.406
Oops, I gave unsolicited advice.

365
00:14:53.406 --> 00:14:55.031
That's what I do sometimes,

366
00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:58.348
and that's not what I want to do with you, you know?

367
00:14:58.348 --> 00:14:59.436
<v ->Yeah.</v>

368
00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:00.343
<v ->Sweet.</v>

369
00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:02.135
<v ->Well, it's interesting, because looking at some of the--</v>

370
00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:04.289
I've been to your website, obviously.

371
00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:07.820
And looking at what some of the people have to say about it,

372
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.300
you're really making a difference in their lives.

373
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.513
You're allowing them to open up into concepts

374
00:15:12.513 --> 00:15:14.528
that might be a little hairy and uncomfortable,

375
00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:18.500
simply because you are a person, a real person.

376
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.250
<v ->Yeah.</v>

377
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.597
<v ->And it lets other people see themselves</v>

378
00:15:20.597 --> 00:15:22.861
as not so flawed, after all.

379
00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:24.621
Or if I'm flawed, we're all flawed.

380
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:26.104
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

381
00:15:26.104 --> 00:15:27.896
<v ->So the sense of the seeking of perfection</v>

382
00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:31.452
is really not part of what you're doing, here.

383
00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:33.826
<v ->I have done that seeking of perfection,</v>

384
00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:36.802
and I am pretty harsh on myself sometimes, but--

385
00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:38.028
<v ->But you're already perfect.</v>

386
00:15:38.028 --> 00:15:40.162
<v ->Yeah, I know, see? Isn't it crazy?</v>

387
00:15:40.162 --> 00:15:42.017
<v ->And so am I, so are all of us.</v>

388
00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:43.319
<v ->I know.</v>

389
00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:46.199
<v ->Let's talk about this whole, this trend,</v>

390
00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:47.830
a larger trend that's going on.

391
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.750
It's going on, well, you mentioned Bill Maher,

392
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.702
and off-camera, I had asked you your thoughts

393
00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:54.626
about Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert and all that.

394
00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:56.651
What happens in a situation like this?

395
00:15:56.651 --> 00:16:00.110
We're in a country that is, for all intents and purposes,

396
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.568
objectively, doing a big skid.

397
00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:04.926
We're slipping into some real crises.

398
00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:06.077
Across the board.

399
00:16:06.077 --> 00:16:07.624
It doesn't really matter which page you open up

400
00:16:07.624 --> 00:16:08.783
on the paper,

401
00:16:08.783 --> 00:16:10.706
there are some challenges ahead.

402
00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:14.361
We go to the comedy acts at night that do the news,

403
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:16.558
we go to Jon Stewart, we go to Stephen Colbert,

404
00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:18.350
and we release a lot of that tension

405
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.007
with a good laugh about our President and others.

406
00:16:22.007 --> 00:16:26.382
What's your philosophical view of that?

407
00:16:26.382 --> 00:16:28.195
What do we do with this energy

408
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:29.613
that really on one hand,

409
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.842
we really need to have change happen.

410
00:16:31.842 --> 00:16:33.880
On the other, we want to just kinda chill and laugh about it

411
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.365
and spend that in that way.

412
00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:37.805
What do we do?

413
00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:39.106
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

414
00:16:39.106 --> 00:16:42.705
<v ->It's a bit of a conundrum.</v>

415
00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:45.485
<v ->Yeah. And you know, the whole...</v>

416
00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:47.971
I would say I would identify with the more liberal

417
00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:50.232
progressive kind of politics,

418
00:16:50.232 --> 00:16:52.616
and at the same time,

419
00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:55.776
in fact, I was a peace activist,

420
00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:58.204
staunchly against the war.

421
00:16:58.204 --> 00:17:00.740
Staunchly against war, period. As a way of...

422
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.904
<v ->Right.</v>

423
00:17:01.904 --> 00:17:03.876
<v ->I mean, it just seems a little absurd to me,</v>

424
00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:07.012
that we are as sophisticated as we are,

425
00:17:07.012 --> 00:17:08.921
and that we still actually take out little guns

426
00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:10.403
and shoot at each other.

427
00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:12.537
I mean, that is, like, weird to me.

428
00:17:12.537 --> 00:17:15.309
<v ->I agree.</v>

429
00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:20.947
<v ->And so,</v>

430
00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:24.753
the resistance, the comedy resistance to that,

431
00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.726
in some ways, strengthens it.

432
00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:29.865
It makes it two positions, you know?

433
00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:33.332
So I don't know. I don't know.

434
00:17:33.332 --> 00:17:34.503
It's nothing

435
00:17:34.503 --> 00:17:38.643
that's too strong to withstand...

436
00:17:38.643 --> 00:17:40.158
I mean, it's nothing strong enough

437
00:17:40.158 --> 00:17:42.451
to withstand transformation of the planet,

438
00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:44.347
which is what I'm interested in.

439
00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:45.661
Transformation of consciousness,

440
00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:48.383
such that we render war obsolete.

441
00:17:48.383 --> 00:17:49.928
You know, I'm really interested in that,

442
00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:50.994
and I know a lot of people

443
00:17:50.994 --> 00:17:52.669
who are really interested in that.

444
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:53.714
And so,

445
00:17:53.714 --> 00:17:57.297
it sort of takes the righteousness of my peace activism,

446
00:17:57.297 --> 00:18:01.170
and makes that a waste of my time, you know?

447
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.049
Like I've been very angry.

448
00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:05.905
I've been a pissed activist, not peace.

449
00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:08.582
A pissed activist.

450
00:18:08.582 --> 00:18:11.453
And I know that being right about how wrong things are

451
00:18:11.453 --> 00:18:13.915
will never, ever make a difference on this planet.

452
00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:16.635
Never have. Never has, and never will.

453
00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:21.627
And that's not the energy that will make a difference.

454
00:18:21.627 --> 00:18:24.763
There's something really female that will make a difference,

455
00:18:24.763 --> 00:18:27.685
and I can't, I don't wanna be, like, so la-la-la,

456
00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:29.424
I'm female, I'm better than you,

457
00:18:29.424 --> 00:18:32.101
but there's really, because it's female-male.

458
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:34.259
It has to be both, you know?

459
00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:38.416
But there's something in that Mother's Day proclamation

460
00:18:38.416 --> 00:18:40.591
that just gets me in my soul,

461
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:42.127
you know what I'm talking about?

462
00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:47.097
The Mother's Day proclamation that Louisa May Alcott wrote,

463
00:18:47.097 --> 00:18:48.711
I think it was?

464
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:51.598
And it was just about,

465
00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:55.548
there's something women have a knowledge of in their core,

466
00:18:55.548 --> 00:18:58.357
because we're nurturers and that's what we do,

467
00:18:58.357 --> 00:19:02.373
that gets...

468
00:19:02.373 --> 00:19:07.064
almost enraged by where the men have taken the society.

469
00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:09.197
And I'm not saying we're victims,

470
00:19:09.197 --> 00:19:12.312
because we volunteered to be second class citizens.

471
00:19:12.312 --> 00:19:13.752
No one did that to us.

472
00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.373
And I know there'll be a lot of women disagreeing.

473
00:19:15.373 --> 00:19:17.325
<v ->Hey, we incarnated, we're here.</v>

474
00:19:17.325 --> 00:19:19.283
<v ->Yeah. Well, that's, yeah.</v>

475
00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:21.459
Someone said, do you wanna try this?

476
00:19:21.459 --> 00:19:23.533
Believe that you're a second class citizen,

477
00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:24.898
and really believe it,

478
00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:26.022
and then try to work your way out of it.

479
00:19:26.022 --> 00:19:26.897
Won't that be fun?

480
00:19:26.897 --> 00:19:28.806
Okay, that sounds good, yeah!

481
00:19:28.806 --> 00:19:30.779
<v ->Yeah.
<v Vanda>You know?</v>

482
00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:33.551
<v Regina>And yet, at the same time, we're born in an era</v>

483
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:36.446
where we're to bring that presence back,

484
00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:39.227
and that's to be part of the guiding force into,

485
00:19:39.227 --> 00:19:41.200
the guiding light, shall we say,

486
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.546
into whatever we're giving birth to here.

487
00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:45.125
Whether it be through laughter, through anger

488
00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.213
or whatnot.

489
00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:47.546
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

490
00:19:47.546 --> 00:19:51.887
Yeah, there's a balance and a beauty, and it's like,

491
00:19:51.887 --> 00:19:54.852
I was walking by the Vietnam memorial not too long ago,

492
00:19:54.852 --> 00:19:56.175
and looking at all the names.

493
00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:59.961
It was an anniversary, so they were saying the names too,

494
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:03.324
so it was multimedia, and I'm like,

495
00:20:03.324 --> 00:20:06.158
if you take the morality out of it, and the duality,

496
00:20:06.158 --> 00:20:07.886
the right and the wrong out of it,

497
00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:09.390
you're just like, hmm.

498
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.131
As a species, look what we've done.

499
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:14.083
It's creative, killing people, that's creative.

500
00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:16.035
Everything's creative.

501
00:20:16.035 --> 00:20:18.029
You know, everything is, you're doing something,

502
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:19.885
it's creating something.

503
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.296
But look what we could create.

504
00:20:22.296 --> 00:20:25.272
You know, if you take, really take the morality out of it,

505
00:20:25.272 --> 00:20:27.085
the right and wrong out of it.

506
00:20:27.085 --> 00:20:29.239
Hmm, we've killed a lot of people.

507
00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:33.495
Just like, spiders take a fly and wrap it up

508
00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:36.343
and suck out its insides or whatever.

509
00:20:36.343 --> 00:20:38.348
It's like, if you take the duality,

510
00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:39.991
the right or wrong out of that,

511
00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:42.220
you think, huh, I wonder how many more eons we'll do that,

512
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.748
before we come up with something a little more interesting.

513
00:20:44.748 --> 00:20:49.611
You know, a little more fun or creative.

514
00:20:49.611 --> 00:20:51.713
<v ->Yeah, it's getting to be an old story.</v>

515
00:20:51.713 --> 00:20:53.526
So looking at all of these stories,

516
00:20:53.526 --> 00:20:55.667
what to you is one of the most...

517
00:20:55.667 --> 00:20:58.123
What are some of the absurdities about human nature

518
00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:01.056
that you really like to get on in your acts?

519
00:21:01.056 --> 00:21:03.723
The whole notion of, you know, peace, love, harmony,

520
00:21:03.723 --> 00:21:06.016
oneness and so forth.

521
00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.733
Okay? Where do you really go?

522
00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:10.986
What do you find really ironic or absurd about all of us?

523
00:21:10.986 --> 00:21:13.098
<v ->You talking about the angel and dolphin crowd?</v>

524
00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:15.125
<v ->There you go. Whatever.</v>

525
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:17.759
<v ->I call them the angel and dolphin crowd.</v>

526
00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:21.247
Yeah, that you can't be good without being bad.

527
00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:23.508
You can't be good without accepting your badness,

528
00:21:23.508 --> 00:21:24.746
you know what I mean?

529
00:21:24.746 --> 00:21:26.942
Like, that's something I really harp on onstage,

530
00:21:26.942 --> 00:21:28.681
because I was, like,

531
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:30.238
my personality was rebellious.

532
00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:33.341
I was a bad girl, you know.

533
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:38.035
So I love to include that.

534
00:21:38.035 --> 00:21:39.571
I have to admit right upfront

535
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:43.005
that I don't feel like I'm spiritual enough.

536
00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:44.776
Like, you ever feel like that?

537
00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:46.376
Like, I don't know.

538
00:21:46.376 --> 00:21:48.370
All my spiritual friends, they're raising their energy

539
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.385
from their lower chakras

540
00:21:50.385 --> 00:21:53.905
up to their heart chakra.

541
00:21:53.905 --> 00:21:57.010
My first chakra is like my favorite chakra so far.

542
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.698
(audience laughter)

543
00:21:59.698 --> 00:22:01.948
Do you know what I mean? I love that chakra.

544
00:22:01.948 --> 00:22:05.067
The others are nice, but I really like that one.

545
00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:06.579
(audience laughter)

546
00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:08.615
I have a line in my act where I say,

547
00:22:08.615 --> 00:22:09.937
I quote John Lennon.

548
00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:11.912
I say, John Lennon, the great Beatle, said,

549
00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:15.163
"We are all Hitler, we are all Jesus Christ."

550
00:22:15.163 --> 00:22:17.883
Now, I do think it's the ratio that counts,

551
00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:19.946
is my little line.

552
00:22:19.946 --> 00:22:23.917
But people say, don't say that! Don't say that!

553
00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:25.348
Because some people just--

554
00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:29.508
Or I say, I'm a liar, a cheat, a tramp and a thief.

555
00:22:29.508 --> 00:22:30.618
And they go, you're not that.

556
00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:32.271
I'm like, yes, I am.

557
00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:33.380
But you're not that anymore!

558
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.703
You've evolved past that, haven't you?

559
00:22:34.703 --> 00:22:36.100
No, you're a liar, too.

560
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.052
You just haven't done the work. Just look.

561
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:39.748
You're probably a cheat and a thief,

562
00:22:39.748 --> 00:22:40.793
I don't know what you are,

563
00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:44.942
but the flavor of your humanness, look.

564
00:22:44.942 --> 00:22:48.962
Keep looking, you'll find it. It's in there, you know?

565
00:22:48.962 --> 00:22:52.334
But it's like, the people who want to think positive,

566
00:22:52.334 --> 00:22:54.509
the only reason they're thinking that way

567
00:22:54.509 --> 00:22:56.579
is because they're really negative.

568
00:22:56.579 --> 00:22:58.392
Do you know what I mean? There's that whole duality.

569
00:22:58.392 --> 00:22:59.896
<v ->When you really have to push toward that.</v>

570
00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:00.877
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

571
00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:03.688
<v Vanda>Yeah, and...</v>

572
00:23:03.688 --> 00:23:05.442
<v ->So you're saying that there's an inherent lack</v>

573
00:23:05.442 --> 00:23:08.413
of acceptance of one's other side,

574
00:23:08.413 --> 00:23:10.924
if you're only putting forth a positive face.

575
00:23:10.924 --> 00:23:14.359
<v ->Yeah. We can't-- and then whatever we resist in another,</v>

576
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.196
we strengthen in ourselves.

577
00:23:16.196 --> 00:23:17.729
Like, so there's certain things

578
00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.673
I can't be with in other people, you know?

579
00:23:20.673 --> 00:23:23.766
And then, mastering that art of going,

580
00:23:23.766 --> 00:23:25.697
where am I that way?

581
00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:28.683
Hmm, because it looks like them, it doesn't look like me.

582
00:23:28.683 --> 00:23:32.872
Or I do a more sophisticated version of that.

583
00:23:32.872 --> 00:23:34.800
Or something, you know?

584
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.491
<v ->Yeah, I can't look like that.</v>

585
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:38.624
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

586
00:23:38.624 --> 00:23:40.853
<v ->Well, what was it like with two comedians together?</v>

587
00:23:40.853 --> 00:23:42.336
Can you tell us a little bit,

588
00:23:42.336 --> 00:23:43.754
without getting too personal, of course,

589
00:23:43.754 --> 00:23:45.269
about your journey with Bill Maher,

590
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:47.285
and that time together?

591
00:23:47.285 --> 00:23:51.743
<v ->Bill Maher was great. A strict disciplinarian.</v>

592
00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:54.996
He was like, "I want you to do good comedy,

593
00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:57.898
"I don't want you to do typically female comedy."

594
00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:00.895
Because women sometimes, in comedy,

595
00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:03.767
take a point of view where they're disempowered,

596
00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:06.697
and they rally favor with the women in the audience

597
00:24:06.697 --> 00:24:09.971
in order to, they curry favor with the women in the audience

598
00:24:09.971 --> 00:24:14.472
in order to get agreement on a point of view.

599
00:24:14.472 --> 00:24:15.518
<v ->Victim.</v>

600
00:24:15.518 --> 00:24:19.208
<v ->Yeah! So he encouraged me never to write female comedy,</v>

601
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:22.675
to always write experientially as a human being,

602
00:24:22.675 --> 00:24:24.765
you know, and some of that's female.

603
00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:27.506
But, and to not, you know, like women tend to generalize,

604
00:24:27.506 --> 00:24:29.330
men are like this.

605
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.655
No! The guy that I saw was like this.

606
00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:33.533
Or something like that, you know?

607
00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:36.071
So he was really strict about that.

608
00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:40.118
Too strict sometimes, my girlfriends got mad at him.

609
00:24:40.118 --> 00:24:43.889
But he was a great, he held the bar really high for me

610
00:24:43.889 --> 00:24:46.707
when I was just starting out in comedy.

611
00:24:46.707 --> 00:24:49.218
<v ->So it sounds like he was a really wonderful mentor.</v>

612
00:24:49.218 --> 00:24:50.513
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

613
00:24:50.513 --> 00:24:52.113
<v ->And he sounds absolutely brilliant, too.</v>

614
00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:54.737
<v ->He's brilliant, yeah! Brilliant.</v>

615
00:24:54.737 --> 00:24:55.921
<v ->And a lot of heart?</v>

616
00:24:55.921 --> 00:24:57.734
<v ->Yeah. Yeah, he's got a deep...</v>

617
00:24:57.734 --> 00:25:00.678
You know, some people would disagree.

618
00:25:00.678 --> 00:25:03.557
But we went to see the movie,

619
00:25:03.557 --> 00:25:07.088
what was that movie with the alien?

620
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:09.434
<v ->Which one? That one that pops out of the chest, or...</v>

621
00:25:09.434 --> 00:25:10.800
<v ->No, no. No, no.</v>

622
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.709
You know, the 80s movie.

623
00:25:12.709 --> 00:25:13.455
<v Voiceover>"E.T."</v>

624
00:25:13.455 --> 00:25:14.703
<v Regina>Oh, "E.T."</v>

625
00:25:14.703 --> 00:25:16.976
<v Vanda>"E.T."! And, you know, Bill cried.</v>

626
00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:21.542
Now a friend of mine said he cried because he wasn't in it.

627
00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:24.431
<v ->No, I think when somebody is that, as we see him today,</v>

628
00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:28.027
when someone's that angrily trying to get their point across

629
00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:30.466
that's usually because there's a really broken heart

630
00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:32.182
underneath all of that.

631
00:25:32.182 --> 00:25:34.020
Do you find that with comedians in general?

632
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.089
<v ->Oh, now you're being all Barbara Walters on me. (laughs)</v>

633
00:25:36.089 --> 00:25:39.289
<v ->I'm sorry! Well, seriously.</v>

634
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:41.240
Well, not seriously, okay?

635
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.436
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

636
00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:47.768
Oh, I think we're all walking wounded, you know?

637
00:25:47.768 --> 00:25:51.896
And that oftentimes, people who make it to fame

638
00:25:51.896 --> 00:25:55.508
are so driven by an unconscious perception

639
00:25:55.508 --> 00:26:00.508
of themselves as, I mean, why would anyone do that?

640
00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:04.226
Crawl through the ladder of this hierarchical town

641
00:26:04.226 --> 00:26:07.127
in order to stand on the top of the trash heap

642
00:26:07.127 --> 00:26:08.684
we call Hollywood,

643
00:26:08.684 --> 00:26:10.455
and reflect culture back to itself.

644
00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:12.662
Why would anyone be driven to do that?

645
00:26:12.662 --> 00:26:14.817
There has to be, like, I don't know,

646
00:26:14.817 --> 00:26:18.361
overcompensation for some perceived lack,

647
00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:20.577
or something like that.

648
00:26:20.577 --> 00:26:21.878
You know, I don't know.

649
00:26:21.878 --> 00:26:26.482
Very rarely is it because I care to contribute

650
00:26:26.482 --> 00:26:29.237
to my fellow men, you know, and women.

651
00:26:29.237 --> 00:26:30.283
I don't know.

652
00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:31.648
<v Regina>But you do now.</v>

653
00:26:31.648 --> 00:26:33.461
That is what you're doing now, isn't it?

654
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:34.805
<v ->Actually, you know, now it is.</v>

655
00:26:34.805 --> 00:26:38.155
Now it is, and...

656
00:26:38.155 --> 00:26:40.821
Yeah, I didn't wanna be in nightclubs again.

657
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:42.613
And then, when my brother was involved

658
00:26:42.613 --> 00:26:46.272
with the movie "What The Bleep Do We Know",

659
00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:49.897
I decided, if I could really--

660
00:26:49.897 --> 00:26:52.138
FIrst of all, I thought about my life

661
00:26:52.138 --> 00:26:54.097
as Eckhart Tolle talks about it,

662
00:26:54.097 --> 00:26:56.126
this little dash between the year of your birth

663
00:26:56.126 --> 00:26:58.654
and the year of your death on your gravestone.

664
00:26:58.654 --> 00:27:01.235
And if you think about that, I want a kick-ass hyphen.

665
00:27:01.235 --> 00:27:03.667
You know, I want a hyphen that's really great.

666
00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:08.223
You know, and so do I want to be on my deathbed going,

667
00:27:08.223 --> 00:27:10.749
you know, I never really fulfilled that dream in Hollywood

668
00:27:10.749 --> 00:27:12.915
that I just loved, I loved comedy.

669
00:27:12.915 --> 00:27:15.421
I mean, when I work with my other comedians,

670
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:18.780
we get together, the "Spiritually Incorrect" comedians,

671
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.549
and we just revel in the, how to turn a phrase.

672
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:27.026
It's just so much fun. The technique of comedy itself.

673
00:27:27.026 --> 00:27:30.375
And the edge of it, and what it expresses.

674
00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:32.529
It's just delightful for us.

675
00:27:32.529 --> 00:27:35.804
So I love comedy, I love making people laugh.

676
00:27:35.804 --> 00:27:40.626
I love laughing myself. I love the edge of truth.

677
00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:44.209
And I love that

678
00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:46.619
there's something very spiritual in laughing.

679
00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:49.270
Like my old guru Ramtha used to say,

680
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.728
"Whatever you can't laugh at owns you."

681
00:27:51.728 --> 00:27:55.163
You know, so you look at, none of us,

682
00:27:55.163 --> 00:27:59.136
me and my comics, we're not sacred,

683
00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:01.876
reverent about anything.

684
00:28:01.876 --> 00:28:05.255
I haven't found a threshold yet.

685
00:28:05.255 --> 00:28:08.320
It's this funny thing, this whole enlightened eating thing.

686
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.831
I was at Whole Foods not too long ago,

687
00:28:09.831 --> 00:28:11.996
and I'm standing in front of the egg selection, right?

688
00:28:11.996 --> 00:28:14.855
And I'm looking at all the vast array of eggs.

689
00:28:14.855 --> 00:28:16.316
It's mind-boggling, right?

690
00:28:16.316 --> 00:28:20.049
There's, like, crappy cheap eggs from caged hens,

691
00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:22.534
you know, just resentful passive-aggressive,

692
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.806
here's your damn egg, yeah, take it!

693
00:28:24.806 --> 00:28:26.086
(audience laughter)

694
00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:28.902
I mean, life is hell!

695
00:28:28.902 --> 00:28:31.313
And then there's cage-free,

696
00:28:31.313 --> 00:28:33.798
and then there's another distinction, free-range,

697
00:28:33.798 --> 00:28:35.910
and then there's another distinction beyond that

698
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.277
which is fully self-realized.

699
00:28:38.277 --> 00:28:40.997
(audience laughter)

700
00:28:40.997 --> 00:28:43.248
They're like, you know what?

701
00:28:43.248 --> 00:28:45.573
These eggs are like, I came first!

702
00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:48.847
(audience laughter)

703
00:28:51.047 --> 00:28:53.116
And then there's another distinction.

704
00:28:53.116 --> 00:28:55.249
The ones I like, I really like the eggs

705
00:28:55.249 --> 00:28:58.619
that actually had crappy circumstances, they were caged,

706
00:28:58.619 --> 00:29:01.638
but they weren't victims of their circumstance.

707
00:29:01.638 --> 00:29:03.259
Right? Right?

708
00:29:03.259 --> 00:29:05.531
(audience laughing and cheering)

709
00:29:05.531 --> 00:29:07.323
Yeah, they saw the movie "The Secret",

710
00:29:07.323 --> 00:29:08.827
they made their little vision board

711
00:29:08.827 --> 00:29:10.363
with whatever newspaper they could find

712
00:29:10.363 --> 00:29:13.147
and then they focused with conscious intention

713
00:29:13.147 --> 00:29:15.120
out of their little stupid chicken brain,

714
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.914
and the universe, the quantum field spun itself

715
00:29:17.914 --> 00:29:20.762
around their little stupid chicken brain intention,

716
00:29:20.762 --> 00:29:23.013
and they were free, you know?

717
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:24.740
That's what I, they're like 12 dollars a dozen,

718
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.458
but they're great with bacon.

719
00:29:26.458 --> 00:29:28.154
(audience laughter)

720
00:29:28.154 --> 00:29:30.148
Yum! L'Chaim!

721
00:29:30.148 --> 00:29:32.377
