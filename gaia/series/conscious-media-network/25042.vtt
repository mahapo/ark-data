00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:04.534
(new age music)

2
00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:14.840
<v ->Rarely have I seen such an impassioned presentation</v>

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.274
as the one given by Andrew Harvey recently at the 2012

4
00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:20.990
Tipping Point Conference in Vancouver, BC.

5
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.590
Andrew drew a standing ovation after challenging

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.424
each one of us to find our passion and turn it into

7
00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:28.234
sacred activism.

8
00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:40.256
<v Regina>Andrew, you just outraged half the people</v>

9
00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:43.272
in the room, and the others came to a point inside

10
00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.820
themselves they didn't expect to find this weekend.

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.564
That point of passion, because this is a conference

12
00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:51.930
about the tipping point, 2012 tipping point,

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.400
and you're saying that tipping point isn't going to happen

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.832
through good wishes alone and through meditating

15
00:00:57.832 --> 00:00:59.704
in our air conditioned rooms alone.

16
00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:01.654
It's going to take something much more than that.

17
00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:03.630
And on that note, would you please, you were telling me

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.386
off camera this beautiful, reciting this beautiful poem

19
00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:08.206
about passion from Roomey.

20
00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.898
<v ->Well, let me just say something about this 2012 thing.</v>

21
00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:14.888
I take very seriously the Mayan prophecies,

22
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:18.398
but I don't take seriously the kind of market fantasies

23
00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:22.324
that have been doled out by I think inscrupulous charlatans.

24
00:01:22.324 --> 00:01:24.144
I came here to honor the Mayan prophecies,

25
00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:26.146
and the Mayan prophecies fundamentally can be

26
00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:27.602
interpreted in two ways.

27
00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:31.424
That they are announcing the end of civilization

28
00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.874
or the beginning of a new world.

29
00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:33.342
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

30
00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:35.214
<v ->And I think both are true.</v>

31
00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:38.256
I think this civilization is doomed, it's going to end,

32
00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:42.416
but that our only chance of getting to a new world,

33
00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:45.328
of creating a new world is through getting real about

34
00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:49.046
putting love and wisdom into what I call sacred activism.

35
00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:52.036
All the rest is wishful thinking, fantasy.

36
00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:54.870
All this bullshit about rainbow bridges coming down

37
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.224
on 2012 and taking us into other dimensions.

38
00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:02.670
Believe me, 2013 will come, and we'll be in terrible shape,

39
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.348
if we're still here, and there'll be no rainbow bridges.

40
00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:08.416
And the same challenge will be being put to the

41
00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.680
human race by God, when will you love yourselves,

42
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.372
love life enough to get together, to establish compassion

43
00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:21.182
and justice here on Earth in a real no-holds-barred,

44
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:24.068
no bullshit down home practical way?

45
00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:27.084
I am sick of all of this new edge fantasy thinking.

46
00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.710
I was always sick about it, but now as the world goes

47
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.596
through such horrific crisis and is about to enter

48
00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:35.196
the storm of its evolution with destiny,

49
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.767
to have serious taken people saying this kind of stuff

50
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.767
in public to a public that's already stupified,

51
00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.378
that's already in a coma, that's already passive,

52
00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:48.547
that needs to be kicked up the ass and begged

53
00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:51.578
to get together in love and passion to get going.

54
00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:52.777
So let's get to the passion poem.

55
00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:53.498
<v Regina>It's very true.</v>

56
00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:54.127
It's very true.

57
00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:55.268
Get to that passion there,

58
00:02:55.268 --> 00:02:56.300
because we got a lot of things to talk about.

59
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.259
<v ->Yes we will.</v>

60
00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.729
<v Regina>Please.</v>

61
00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:58.371
<v ->I'm on a roll.</v>

62
00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:03.682
I really tried today to give a coherent message

63
00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:04.702
to everybody in that room

64
00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.942
which is you can no longer be taken in

65
00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:09.831
by this new age bullshit.

66
00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:13.732
You have to get serious about the authentic transformation

67
00:03:13.732 --> 00:03:17.033
which is breaking out of your comfort zone for love

68
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:20.123
and putting your life on the line for sacrificial service

69
00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:21.683
at this moment when the whole world

70
00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:23.752
and all of the animal race is in danger.

71
00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:25.552
And you have to get going together.

72
00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:27.352
You have to organize right now.

73
00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.243
And you also have to understand

74
00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.583
that this birth of a new humanity

75
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:33.172
isn't inevitable.

76
00:03:33.172 --> 00:03:34.913
It's not just going to happen because you're fabulous

77
00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.382
and you're beautiful and you're thin.

78
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:39.742
And you do yoga and you have vegetarian food.

79
00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:42.413
And you speak in a self new age voice.

80
00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:44.662
It's not gonna happen because you're adorable.

81
00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:47.063
You're gonna have to sweat for it.

82
00:03:47.063 --> 00:03:49.162
It's gonna have to be earned.

83
00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:51.713
It's gonna have to be earned by deep inner work

84
00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:54.863
and wise outer sacred work.

85
00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:58.073
How could people even begin to understand the,

86
00:03:58.073 --> 00:04:01.643
to entertain these narcissistic fantasies?

87
00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:03.443
It's craziness.

88
00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.913
And it breaks my heart.

89
00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:05.752
<v Regina>But you know what, Andrew,</v>

90
00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:07.313
it appeals to a part of people

91
00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.253
that does not have to put itself on the line.

92
00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:11.932
<v ->Right, which is everybody at the moment.</v>

93
00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:13.942
Because at the moment, the crisis

94
00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:17.093
hasn't absolutely hit the middle class,

95
00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:18.023
the upper middle class.

96
00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:19.493
It's going to hit that though.

97
00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.582
<v Regina>I agree with you 100%.</v>

98
00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:22.163
It's going to hit big time.

99
00:04:22.163 --> 00:04:23.598
<v ->Right.</v>

100
00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:24.796
<v Regina>Once it starts in stages,</v>

101
00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:26.298
it's gonna be like a snowball.

102
00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:28.608
We'll mostly for the most part

103
00:04:28.608 --> 00:04:30.136
feel very unprepared for.

104
00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.878
<v ->We're not feeling it in this cocoon.</v>

105
00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:32.837
I travel all around the world.

106
00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:36.377
Tell a Somalian that the crisis hasn't started.

107
00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:38.717
Tell a Ugandan woman that the crisis hasn't started.

108
00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:41.058
Tell an Indian peasant who's living on less

109
00:04:41.058 --> 00:04:42.977
than a dollar a day that the crisis hasn't started.

110
00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:45.018
Tell a snow leopard that's trying to survive

111
00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.117
in the mountains, he's trying to protect himself

112
00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:49.578
and his family from poachers.

113
00:04:49.578 --> 00:04:51.498
Tell those people.

114
00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:53.298
Tell those animals the crisis hasn't started.

115
00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:55.577
Tell the villagers of Ecuador the crisis hasn't started.

116
00:04:55.577 --> 00:05:00.577
We who are causing the crisis are by some horrific paradox

117
00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:02.777
the last to know that the crisis is going on

118
00:05:02.777 --> 00:05:06.197
because the empire that is devastating the world

119
00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:08.958
has got wax in his ears.

120
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:09.828
Wax in its ears.

121
00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:12.287
And can't here the screams of the poor.

122
00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:14.957
And can't hear the howls of the dying animals.

123
00:05:14.957 --> 00:05:18.887
And can't smell the oil that's actually reeking up the gulf.

124
00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:21.857
And can't face anything because he's being kept

125
00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:25.067
totally stupefied by a stupefying media.

126
00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:27.438
<v Regina>Yes, Amen.</v>

127
00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:29.597
Let's get to this poem.

128
00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:32.778
This poem by Rumi whom I also love.

129
00:05:32.778 --> 00:05:35.898
<v ->Well, I love Rumi because Rumi is the great poet</v>

130
00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:37.427
of divine love.

131
00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:41.238
And I love him to because he discovered that love

132
00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:42.768
and all lovers of God discover this,

133
00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:44.688
is not just peace.

134
00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:46.307
Peace is very importance.

135
00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:49.638
And serenity, serenity is very important.

136
00:05:49.638 --> 00:05:51.648
I couldn't live my life without the deep peace,

137
00:05:51.648 --> 00:05:52.998
and the deep serenity.

138
00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:56.387
But what the great lovers of god discover is that

139
00:05:56.387 --> 00:06:00.288
in divine love there is this unbelievable wild,

140
00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:02.777
beautiful gorgeous naked energy.

141
00:06:02.777 --> 00:06:04.548
And that gorgeous naked energy

142
00:06:04.548 --> 00:06:07.338
is the energy of what in the Persian tradition

143
00:06:07.338 --> 00:06:09.048
they call Ishk, passion.

144
00:06:09.048 --> 00:06:11.507
It's actually the energy of the mother side of god.

145
00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:12.618
The heart side.

146
00:06:12.618 --> 00:06:14.088
Oh, I don't mind, I've got stain.

147
00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:14.688
<v Regina>No it's not that.</v>

148
00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:16.608
Just in case you're thumping your chest on your microphone.

149
00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:17.447
<v ->Oh. my microphone.</v>

150
00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:18.678
No because I have people,

151
00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.447
I know that we're supposed to be sanitized an everything

152
00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:21.137
and never sweat.

153
00:06:21.137 --> 00:06:23.117
But I'm sweating because I'm loved.

154
00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:25.008
And in this poem,

155
00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:29.507
he describes the power of this thing they call ishk

156
00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:32.058
which is the passion force of the god-head.

157
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.708
The force that is coming from the god-head

158
00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:34.998
to transform everything.

159
00:06:34.998 --> 00:06:37.548
And he goes and says

160
00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:42.378
passion burns down every branch of exhaustion.

161
00:06:42.378 --> 00:06:47.378
Passion is the supreme elixir and renews all things.

162
00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:52.008
So don't sigh heavily, your brow bleak with boredom.

163
00:06:52.008 --> 00:06:55.338
Dare to look for passion, passion, passion, passion.

164
00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:58.277
Futile solutions decieve the force of passion.

165
00:06:58.277 --> 00:07:02.207
They are bandits who extort money through lies.

166
00:07:02.207 --> 00:07:03.738
Run, my friends.

167
00:07:03.738 --> 00:07:06.527
Run far away from all false solutions.

168
00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:10.788
Let divine passion triumph

169
00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:13.548
and rebirth you in yourself.

170
00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:15.558
What I was saying to everybody in that room was,

171
00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:17.478
you are on drugs.

172
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.847
You're on the drugs of a stupefied capitalism.

173
00:07:19.847 --> 00:07:21.797
You're on the drugs of a stupefied media.

174
00:07:21.797 --> 00:07:23.598
And you're on the drugs of a new age

175
00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:25.848
that is trying to addict you

176
00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:28.217
to its wishful magical fantasies

177
00:07:28.217 --> 00:07:31.068
and get you blissed out on nothing

178
00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:34.098
so that you don't do anything real

179
00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:37.098
about what really needs to be done right now.

180
00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:39.287
And I can't join in that drug pushing

181
00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:41.807
because to me, that keeps people

182
00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:43.457
spiritual zombies.

183
00:07:43.457 --> 00:07:45.168
At a moment when we have to have

184
00:07:45.168 --> 00:07:48.258
real golden fireblood running in our veins

185
00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:50.718
and wild hearts and brave minds.

186
00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:52.518
And heroic,

187
00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:54.767
heroic passion to do something real

188
00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:58.067
about a world that is burning to death.

189
00:07:58.067 --> 00:07:59.837
So that's why I love Rumi.

190
00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:01.428
Because I know the truth of those words.

191
00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:04.247
If I wasn't bathed in divine love,

192
00:08:04.247 --> 00:08:06.107
and if I wasn't bathed in this fire,

193
00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:09.107
I would be annihilated by what's happening out there

194
00:08:09.107 --> 00:08:10.308
twice a day.

195
00:08:10.308 --> 00:08:13.488
And annihilated by the stupor of the new age.

196
00:08:13.488 --> 00:08:16.637
And annihilated by the incredible selfishness

197
00:08:16.637 --> 00:08:18.288
of the CEOs and the corporations.

198
00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:20.838
And then annihilated by the weakness and cowardice

199
00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:21.768
of the governments.

200
00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:24.078
And annihilated by what I know to be true

201
00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:25.848
which is that we are losing the battle

202
00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:27.797
for the future of the earth.

203
00:08:27.797 --> 00:08:29.538
Unless something amazing happens

204
00:08:29.538 --> 00:08:31.278
and a whole global revolution

205
00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:32.657
of love and action starts going,

206
00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:35.598
we might as well now just sing kumbaya

207
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.998
and take the Kool Aid.

208
00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:40.787
Because until we get real and get going,

209
00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:43.008
nothing real can get done.

210
00:08:43.008 --> 00:08:45.257
But I'm not annihilated because

211
00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:48.138
the passion for god, the passion of love for humanity,

212
00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:50.778
the passion to bring this vision of sacred activism

213
00:08:50.778 --> 00:08:52.638
is what gets me up every single morning

214
00:08:52.638 --> 00:08:56.298
cause I know it's part of the only way through.

215
00:08:56.298 --> 00:08:57.798
<v Regina>And people,</v>

216
00:08:57.798 --> 00:09:00.078
because of thie being narcotized,

217
00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:01.187
<v ->Narcotized?</v>

218
00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:03.738
I mean, they're dead!

219
00:09:03.738 --> 00:09:04.488
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

220
00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:05.117
And we are.

221
00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:07.697
It starts out with a barrage,

222
00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:09.108
if you do it this way,

223
00:09:09.108 --> 00:09:12.947
of you wake up to your radio, right, in the morning.

224
00:09:12.947 --> 00:09:15.438
And the news starts, the news starts.

225
00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:16.938
And pretty soon within minutes,

226
00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:19.787
you're having to blunt yourself from the harshness

227
00:09:19.787 --> 00:09:22.249
of the realities that are taking place everyday.

228
00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:24.199
And then pretty soon you're looking for other ways

229
00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:26.179
to not feel it as the day goes on.

230
00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:27.890
We're doing everything to not feel.

231
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.899
<v ->And you're told by so-called spiritual leaders</v>

232
00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:33.259
that if you say words like environmental destruction

233
00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:35.839
or if you feel anxiety or if you feel terror,

234
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.670
that you're spiritually insufficient.

235
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.739
So there you're already narcotized.

236
00:09:39.739 --> 00:09:42.319
And then you have faith teachers with faith mysticism

237
00:09:42.319 --> 00:09:45.049
damping down your feelings even more

238
00:09:45.049 --> 00:09:47.630
when your one chance of becoming a true human being

239
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.860
at this time,

240
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.580
is to become strong enough to allow your feelings

241
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.009
of pain and fear and heartbreak

242
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:57.229
to actually break over you

243
00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.450
so that you can actually follow the truth in them,

244
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.490
the sacred truth hidden in them all,

245
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.129
and start doing something real about the world.

246
00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:06.950
People go on and on about choosing love not fear.

247
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.170
That's a completely false distinction.

248
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.230
If I love you, and I suspect that if I had a chance,

249
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.340
I would love you.

250
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.699
If I love you, then,

251
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.759
if you're shooting up on crack.

252
00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:21.499
I'm not gonna be sitting in the lotus position

253
00:10:21.499 --> 00:10:22.729
watching you shoot up.

254
00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:25.040
I am going to be afraid for your life,

255
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.470
afraid for your sanity, afraid for your health.

256
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.450
Afraid for your relationships, and I am going

257
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.460
to reach forward with everything that I am.

258
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.260
And I am going to use my whole repertoire,

259
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.910
my whole Maria Callas, Tina Turner,

260
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.359
repertoire of tricks to try and get you to grow sane

261
00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:39.740
because I love you.

262
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.439
So if I love, I will be afraid.

263
00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:44.389
If a mother loves a child, she's not going to just

264
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:47.270
let the child go across the highway,

265
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.140
she's gonna be afraid.

266
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.880
She's gonna teach it about life.

267
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.279
There is an aspect of fear that is sacred

268
00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:54.740
because fear warns, fear wakes up,

269
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.970
fear makes us real.

270
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.219
So when these bloody new age teachers go on and on

271
00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:00.080
about love not fear,

272
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.660
they are adding to the narcosis.

273
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.910
They're giving people more drugs

274
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.489
and they're not helping people do the real thing

275
00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:10.069
which is to say there is an aspect about your fear

276
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.359
for the future of the world

277
00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:13.340
which is absolutely real.

278
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.480
I am afraid too

279
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.969
because I, like you, love the world.

280
00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:18.379
What we now need to do

281
00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:22.039
is to be strong enough through spiritual practice

282
00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.530
to face that fear, face that heartbreak.

283
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.449
Come together in real sacred action

284
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:28.880
and go out and do something.

285
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.919
Not tamp down the fear,

286
00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:33.559
not make people who are shattered by heartbreak

287
00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.249
and what happened,

288
00:11:34.249 --> 00:11:35.570
feeling spiritually insufficient

289
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.249
because they're not bliss bunnies.

290
00:11:37.249 --> 00:11:39.980
What kind of psychosis is this?

291
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.140
And this is the psychosis that they're selling

292
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.609
in the bizzare of the new age

293
00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:45.049
and it's an outrage.

294
00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:47.000
<v Regina>Well, it creates a very deep schism</v>

295
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.729
within the minds and within the feeling bodies

296
00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:50.570
of every one of us.

297
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.369
<v ->It creates a schizophrenia</v>

298
00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:56.419
which is already legislated by a corporate fascism

299
00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:59.630
which wants us to keep relentlessly cheerful

300
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.240
as it rapes and degrades the world.

301
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.219
And wants us to be stupefied,

302
00:12:04.219 --> 00:12:06.020
and wants us to be addicted to comfort

303
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.149
because that's how it controls us.

304
00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:10.759
So if this mysticism, this fake mysticism

305
00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.700
which teaches people how to materialize things

306
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.660
or so called,

307
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.239
which actually like this dreadful woman who wrote the secret

308
00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:19.309
and the power is teaching people that the greatest power

309
00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:21.080
in the world is the power to have what they want

310
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.940
at a time when millions are starving

311
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.650
and the forests are burning and nobody is getting

312
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.820
really what they want.

313
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.490
How could they in a world which is burning to death?

314
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.069
These people are actually part

315
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:33.380
of the corporate fascist agenda.

316
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.780
Because they keep people stupefied,

317
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.720
passive, paralyzed and greedy

318
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.330
at the time when we need to get out of all

319
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.260
of those things.

320
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.690
And it is an absolutely terrifying.

321
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.949
It is terrifying when you see

322
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:47.060
just how successful they are.

323
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.470
Because obviously,

324
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.310
in a time when people are radically in dread,

325
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.649
they'll grasp for anybody who will tell them

326
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.629
that they have no reason to be dreading.

327
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:58.340
Big daddy will look after you.

328
00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.749
The corporations will look after you.

329
00:12:59.749 --> 00:13:00.980
The government will look after you.

330
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.359
God will look after you.

331
00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:04.969
And the rainbow bridges will come and look after you.

332
00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:08.510
This is all part of the infantilization of the psyche

333
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.572
that goes on down in this corporate fascism.

334
00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:13.193
And it is a disaster.

335
00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.593
<v Regina>And yet one of the distinct features of humanity</v>

336
00:13:15.593 --> 00:13:19.102
is that this planet, these people have choice.

337
00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:23.302
And it's the one thing we often do not employ.

338
00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.982
We don't employ choice.

339
00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:27.593
Because we're so heavily programmed to begin with.

340
00:13:27.593 --> 00:13:29.122
<v ->Well it takes a lot of guts to make a choice</v>

341
00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:30.712
that doesn't fit in with the culture.

342
00:13:30.712 --> 00:13:32.452
It takes a lot of guts to say,

343
00:13:32.452 --> 00:13:34.883
don't talk to me about love not fear.

344
00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:37.193
My love is afraid for the world

345
00:13:37.193 --> 00:13:38.812
and my fear is sacred.

346
00:13:38.812 --> 00:13:40.343
And I'm not gonna buy this bullshit anymore.

347
00:13:40.343 --> 00:13:41.873
And don't talk to me about a god

348
00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:43.972
that just wants me to just sit there

349
00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:46.552
and pray for mcmansions and mercedes benzes

350
00:13:46.552 --> 00:13:48.052
because I don't want that.

351
00:13:48.052 --> 00:13:50.572
I want the poor to be fed and the fish

352
00:13:50.572 --> 00:13:52.102
to stop being polluted.

353
00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:53.783
That's what I want and you can't give me that

354
00:13:53.783 --> 00:13:55.973
because you're not able to change the culture

355
00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:58.912
that enslaves the poor and pollutes the seas.

356
00:13:58.912 --> 00:14:00.503
You don't want me to know

357
00:14:00.503 --> 00:14:02.573
that you want me to be greedy so that I don't wake up

358
00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:04.012
to what you're doing.

359
00:14:04.012 --> 00:14:05.123
<v Regina>And you're talking about</v>

360
00:14:05.123 --> 00:14:07.373
a progression of humanity and evolution into,

361
00:14:07.373 --> 00:14:09.773
in the new age sense,

362
00:14:09.773 --> 00:14:12.413
really acting now as one.

363
00:14:12.413 --> 00:14:14.445
One, what's good for one is good for all.

364
00:14:14.445 --> 00:14:15.945
And this is, in the true sense of the word,

365
00:14:15.945 --> 00:14:16.905
this is what you're saying.

366
00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:18.645
<v ->Well this is what they say they believe,</v>

367
00:14:18.645 --> 00:14:20.625
but you know damn well they don't believe that

368
00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:22.275
because as soon as you ask them to do anything,

369
00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:25.604
they vanish off into their hills clutching their crystals

370
00:14:25.604 --> 00:14:26.865
and ohmming and schmoming.

371
00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.605
If they believed about oneness,

372
00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:31.004
they'd also believe in being one with the poor

373
00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.375
and one with the seas that are polluted

374
00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:35.504
and one with the horror of what's really happening.

375
00:14:35.504 --> 00:14:37.905
They just believe in the kind of comfortable

376
00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:39.135
Malibu oneness.

377
00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:41.175
Not anything that will actually break their hearts open

378
00:14:41.175 --> 00:14:42.344
or make them do anything.

379
00:14:42.344 --> 00:14:44.876
I've talked to the new age for 20 years.

380
00:14:44.876 --> 00:14:46.735
I don't know how I found the courage to go out there

381
00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:48.956
again and again and do this again and again.

382
00:14:48.956 --> 00:14:49.976
And I haven't,

383
00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:51.595
I found a lot of talk about oneness,

384
00:14:51.595 --> 00:14:54.626
but no realization of it, no organization of it.

385
00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:56.936
No feeling one with the battered, the oppressed,

386
00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:59.215
the horrible, the horribly afflicted.

387
00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:02.486
All with those who are in terrible need.

388
00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:04.195
It somehow stops short

389
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.715
of actually doing anything real.

390
00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:07.795
<v Regina>It doesn't, yet at the same time,</v>

391
00:15:07.795 --> 00:15:09.146
those who are put on a pedestal

392
00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:10.856
are those who took action.

393
00:15:10.856 --> 00:15:11.966
Such as Gandhi.

394
00:15:11.966 --> 00:15:13.526
You always hear reference to Gandhi

395
00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:14.816
and Martin Luther King and so forth

396
00:15:14.816 --> 00:15:16.706
even at new age conferences.

397
00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:20.065
<v ->People will pay lip service in this charade,</v>

398
00:15:20.065 --> 00:15:20.996
this parody.

399
00:15:20.996 --> 00:15:22.316
<v Regina>And that's what you're calling them on,</v>

400
00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:23.696
just keep paying the lip service.

401
00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:25.225
<v ->You have the icons,</v>

402
00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:26.426
you trot in the icons.

403
00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.435
They are Gandhi.

404
00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:29.785
They are Martin Luther King.

405
00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:30.535
<v Regina>Mother Teresa.</v>

406
00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:31.766
<v ->Mother Teresa.</v>

407
00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:33.295
And perhaps sometimes Mandela.

408
00:15:33.295 --> 00:15:35.006
And of course his holiness the Dalai Lama

409
00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:36.776
who is an authentic sacred activist

410
00:15:36.776 --> 00:15:38.936
who's really putting his life on the line.

411
00:15:38.936 --> 00:15:40.556
And they trot this through.

412
00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:43.495
But is anybody actually organizing like Gandhi

413
00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:46.046
to unseat the corporate madness?

414
00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:48.325
Is anybody actually risking his life

415
00:15:48.325 --> 00:15:50.545
like Martin Luther King every single day

416
00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:51.416
risked his life?

417
00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:52.525
I've had death threats.

418
00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:54.865
I've actually had death threats for years.

419
00:15:54.865 --> 00:15:57.025
Because I stood up and denounced the guru system.

420
00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:59.665
And I've had death threats doing this work.

421
00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:00.956
Because it's radical.

422
00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:02.846
Because it's not playing safe.

423
00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:04.556
Because it makes enemies.

424
00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:07.226
Because it's really rattling the corporate cages.

425
00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:09.386
I'm not in anyway saying that I'm like

426
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.435
Martin Luther King but,

427
00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:12.415
the people who invoke Martin Luther King,

428
00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:14.725
they're being driven by chauffeur limousines

429
00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:19.725
to their expensive hotel rooms.

430
00:16:19.826 --> 00:16:23.186
What kind of bullshit is this?

431
00:16:23.186 --> 00:16:24.295
<v Regina>Well, everybody that's listening</v>

432
00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:25.076
to this right now?

433
00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:26.215
<v ->Are you enjoying this?</v>

434
00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:29.305
<v Regina>(laughing) everybody watching this</v>

435
00:16:29.305 --> 00:16:31.106
right now, I think you can understand

436
00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:33.806
why there was an interesting reaction to you.

437
00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:35.877
Albeit the most powerful reaction of the conference so far.

438
00:16:35.877 --> 00:16:37.467
<v ->I think it was a tremendous reaction.</v>

439
00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:38.217
<v Regina>Everyone was standing on their feet.</v>

440
00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:39.207
It was wonderful.

441
00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.038
<v ->I think the truth is,</v>

442
00:16:41.038 --> 00:16:43.857
that of course people, when I go face to face

443
00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:46.498
like I do now, because I have no time to waste,

444
00:16:46.498 --> 00:16:49.137
I am going to tell the truth even if it puts me

445
00:16:49.137 --> 00:16:50.608
in a cement kimono.

446
00:16:50.608 --> 00:16:53.967
I am bored with lies and I am not going to lie.

447
00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:55.168
I'm gonna be myself.

448
00:16:55.168 --> 00:16:58.918
I think that 80% of the people in that room

449
00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:01.138
are incredibly grateful that somebody got up

450
00:17:01.138 --> 00:17:03.388
and said what is actually on their minds

451
00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:04.079
and in their hearts.
<v Regina>Judging from their</v>

452
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.158
response, I would say

453
00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:06.240
<v ->There was a standing ovation</v>

454
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.681
and I was watching some people wince

455
00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:10.170
when said things about rainbow bridges and stuff.

456
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.460
But I meant them to wince.

457
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.511
I want them to wince.

458
00:17:12.511 --> 00:17:14.910
I want them to really hear me

459
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.711
that this is radioactive bullshit.

460
00:17:19.711 --> 00:17:20.971
Look, I am a mystic.

461
00:17:20.971 --> 00:17:24.361
I know that amazing extraordinary things happen.

462
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:25.770
I have seen rainbows appear.

463
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.460
I have seen radiant angels.

464
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.201
I have been talked to by Rumi.

465
00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:34.410
I have had a whole variety of mystical experiences.

466
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.361
The highest kind through the grace of god.

467
00:17:36.361 --> 00:17:39.901
But I also know that they belong to that dimension.

468
00:17:39.901 --> 00:17:42.121
It's not this dimension.

469
00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:43.980
They are there, they come to us

470
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.180
to inspire us to actually raise this dimension up.

471
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.830
Not to flee from this dimension,

472
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.131
but to actually put into practice the laws

473
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:56.011
of love and justice that you learn from that dimension.

474
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:57.390
And what the new age is doing

475
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.810
is using these incredibly beautiful mystical experiences

476
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.950
as a drug to sign off from actually doing the real work

477
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.530
that the divine wants humanity to do

478
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.831
which is to birth the divine in the human

479
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:13.981
and then birth the divine in science, in art,

480
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:16.291
in all institutions, in the way we live and

481
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:17.281
on the nature,

482
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:18.480
And in the new world and in education.

483
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.451
Everything, a real divine transformation.

484
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:23.670
This is a huge enterprise.

485
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.291
And it's nothing.

486
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:28.351
What the new age is doing, is just using,

487
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:29.550
as it does everything else

488
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.951
as we are a totally narcicisstic culture.

489
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:34.350
You know we use everything to flatter ourselves

490
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.941
instead of to get ourselves on our knees

491
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.001
doing real work to do the real transformation

492
00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:42.990
in the real world.

493
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.161
I am sick of this.

494
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:45.751
And I, what was wonderful

495
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.371
is that I risked it in that room

496
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:49.111
and they seem to be sick of it too.

497
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:50.251
We shall see.

498
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:51.601
<v Regina>I was surprised to the degree</v>

499
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:52.741
which that was true.

500
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:53.461
I really was.

501
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:55.680
<v ->I was actually sitting next to</v>

502
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.991
some wonderful young people.

503
00:18:57.991 --> 00:18:59.401
And as I go that's who I like,

504
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:01.561
He's obviously a decent person.

505
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:03.931
He must belief this rubbish, god bless him.

506
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:07.050
The guy next to me, behind me,

507
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.121
these young people were saying

508
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:11.670
this is such garbage.

509
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.201
This is such rubbish.

510
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:15.150
We are in such trouble.

511
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.510
All these people here, these upper-middle class people here.

512
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.521
They're paying to listen to this garbage

513
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:22.950
so that they won't do anything.

514
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.051
They'll just believe that it'll be enough

515
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:27.631
to sit there and vibrate and it will be done for them.

516
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:29.310
And I turn to them and I said,

517
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.711
I love what you're saying, help me.

518
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:33.810
And the guy looked at me with such sadness.

519
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.911
And he said I have listened to all the people

520
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:36.931
in this conference.

521
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:38.071
They're nice people.

522
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:41.461
But they're in a complete zoned out bubble.

523
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:43.170
They're not in the real world.

524
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.031
They can't lead us out of this crisis

525
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:47.041
because they're not facing this crisis.

526
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:49.291
They're in denial about this crisis.

527
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:52.741
They're completely selling their own

528
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:54.751
very well-marketed BS

529
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:57.570
which they've been getting famous and rich off for years.

530
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.611
And we have had it.

531
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:01.201
And that was what gave me the guts to go out

532
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.401
and give the speech I was,

533
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:04.470
because I was up to hat moment thinking,

534
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.321
I maybe I will just start to give a sweet speech

535
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:08.820
because I'm tired.

536
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.681
I've been traveling,.

537
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:13.620
But that young man's passion.

538
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.841
I wasn't going to fail him.

539
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:17.791
I was gonna give him something

540
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.701
to show him that not everybody in their 50s

541
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:25.701
in this new age circus is a neutered fat-cat idiot

542
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.430
purveying rubbish to people

543
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.990
at a time when the world is burning to death

544
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.090
and needs sacred action.

545
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:33.811
<v Regina>Andrew,</v>

546
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:35.301
<v ->You may cut that last part.</v>

547
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:35.891
<v Regina>We may.</v>

548
00:20:35.891 --> 00:20:36.741
<v ->No, don't cut it.</v>

549
00:20:36.741 --> 00:20:37.851
Let's get it out there.

550
00:20:37.851 --> 00:20:40.041
They can think I'm crazy, but who cares?

551
00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:41.181
<v Regina>Wasn't planning on it.</v>

552
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:47.333
As you mentioned earlier, off camera,

553
00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:48.863
it's not as though you don't spend your

554
00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:50.932
contemplative time, your peaceful time,

555
00:20:50.932 --> 00:20:52.103
your time in prayer.

556
00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:54.652
As you say, pray and then do something.

557
00:20:54.652 --> 00:20:58.223
<v ->Look, the revolution that I'm calling for</v>

558
00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:01.102
is a revolution that takes people deep

559
00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:03.982
into the depths of peace and serenity.

560
00:21:03.982 --> 00:21:08.122
So they can fuel passion of action in the world.

561
00:21:08.122 --> 00:21:12.412
To be really as passionate as you need to be, I think,

562
00:21:12.412 --> 00:21:15.923
you have to have a very strong foundation in peace.

563
00:21:15.923 --> 00:21:18.833
If you want a burning candle to burn a long time,

564
00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:22.582
it has to have a lot of golden wax to burn from.

565
00:21:22.582 --> 00:21:24.502
I spend a great deal of time.

566
00:21:24.502 --> 00:21:27.232
I wake up at five in the morning very often

567
00:21:27.232 --> 00:21:29.963
and spend two hours in prayer and meditation

568
00:21:29.963 --> 00:21:32.092
and in deep prayer to the mother

569
00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:33.653
and in exercises.

570
00:21:33.653 --> 00:21:35.962
I can't do this work at this level of energy

571
00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:37.493
and at this level of commitment

572
00:21:37.493 --> 00:21:39.893
unless I'm grounded in sacred practice.

573
00:21:39.893 --> 00:21:41.453
Nobody can, that's why I call it

574
00:21:41.453 --> 00:21:43.523
sacred activism.

575
00:21:43.523 --> 00:21:45.172
<v Regina>Would you share with us some,</v>

576
00:21:45.172 --> 00:21:47.454
you have five different elements or principles

577
00:21:47.454 --> 00:21:49.494
that you work with in your sacred activism.

578
00:21:49.494 --> 00:21:50.333
Can you share them with us?

579
00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:51.474
<v ->First of all, If you've been able to endure</v>

580
00:21:51.474 --> 00:21:52.374
the lunacy up to now,

581
00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:53.663
go and get my book called

582
00:21:53.663 --> 00:21:55.853
"The Hope: A guide to Sacred Activism".

583
00:21:55.853 --> 00:21:57.504
It's probably the greatest book

584
00:21:57.504 --> 00:21:59.543
ever written by a human being.

585
00:21:59.543 --> 00:22:00.293
I'm joking.

586
00:22:00.293 --> 00:22:02.604
I mean, that's the way they talk.

587
00:22:02.604 --> 00:22:04.914
But it's my passionate plea to the world

588
00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:06.144
to get real and get going.

589
00:22:06.144 --> 00:22:08.574
And I try to give a guide map, a road map

590
00:22:08.574 --> 00:22:10.644
to the whole transformation in it

591
00:22:10.644 --> 00:22:11.543
that I understand.

592
00:22:11.543 --> 00:22:13.104
The transformation into a divine humanity

593
00:22:13.104 --> 00:22:14.454
that can act.

594
00:22:14.454 --> 00:22:15.623
<v Regina>So until the book arrives,</v>

595
00:22:15.623 --> 00:22:17.244
can you give us a couple bullets?

596
00:22:17.244 --> 00:22:19.914
<v ->Well I would think it's very important to,</v>

597
00:22:19.914 --> 00:22:22.463
first of all, let me define sacred activism.

598
00:22:22.463 --> 00:22:24.144
I define sacred activism in the book

599
00:22:24.144 --> 00:22:28.043
as the marriage of the two noblest fires in the human heart.

600
00:22:28.043 --> 00:22:30.203
The fire of the mystic's passion for god

601
00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:33.324
with the fire of the activist's passion for justice.

602
00:22:33.324 --> 00:22:37.164
And when these two fires come together,

603
00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:39.834
they fuse in a third fire.

604
00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:41.393
Which is actually,

605
00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:43.673
and this is the great, great revelation.

606
00:22:43.673 --> 00:22:48.233
This is the fire of the mother side of god's love

607
00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.104
for the creation.

608
00:22:49.104 --> 00:22:51.474
It is a fiery love and wisdom in action.

609
00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:54.024
It is the evolutionary fire.

610
00:22:54.024 --> 00:22:57.564
And anybody who allows themselves to be possesed

611
00:22:57.564 --> 00:23:01.164
by this fire will be turned into a radioactive,

612
00:23:01.164 --> 00:23:03.594
divinely embodied sacred activist

613
00:23:03.594 --> 00:23:06.384
capable of really doing extraordinary things

614
00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:08.273
fearlessly and beautifully and calmly

615
00:23:08.273 --> 00:23:10.254
and passionately in the world.

616
00:23:10.254 --> 00:23:11.963
I have described my own journey

617
00:23:11.963 --> 00:23:13.584
to this revelation.

618
00:23:13.584 --> 00:23:15.654
And it is beautifully described

619
00:23:15.654 --> 00:23:20.063
in a really grand quote by Teilhard de Chardin

620
00:23:20.063 --> 00:23:20.933
when he says,

621
00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:25.404
"Someday after we have mastered the tides

622
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:29.964
"and gravity, we shall harness the energies of love.

623
00:23:29.964 --> 00:23:32.244
"And then for the second time in the history of humanity,

624
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.434
"We will have discovered fire."

625
00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:37.584
This third fire is the fire that we are going to discover.

626
00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.113
And it's going to be discovered by,

627
00:23:39.113 --> 00:23:40.883
is being discovered by thousands of,

628
00:23:40.883 --> 00:23:42.474
hundreds of thousands of people now.

629
00:23:42.474 --> 00:23:44.243
And it brings together the mystic's passion

630
00:23:44.243 --> 00:23:46.344
with the activist's passion for justice.

631
00:23:46.344 --> 00:23:48.444
How do you birth this fire?

632
00:23:48.444 --> 00:23:49.583
How do you birth it practically?

633
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:50.904
My book is a practical book.

634
00:23:50.904 --> 00:23:52.823
It's exalted but it's down home.

635
00:23:52.823 --> 00:23:55.253
And I say there are really five essential kinds

636
00:23:55.253 --> 00:23:57.354
of service that you need to get downward

637
00:23:57.354 --> 00:23:58.643
in the core of your life.

638
00:23:58.643 --> 00:24:02.993
And right now, to be able to do this work,

639
00:24:02.993 --> 00:24:05.934
first, service to god through thanksgiving

640
00:24:05.934 --> 00:24:08.903
and gratitude and passion and adoration.

641
00:24:08.903 --> 00:24:11.393
Because that service will allow the divine

642
00:24:11.393 --> 00:24:13.643
and whatever you think of the divine,

643
00:24:13.643 --> 00:24:16.284
whether you're a buddhist or a hindu or a christian,

644
00:24:16.284 --> 00:24:17.273
doesn't matter.

645
00:24:17.273 --> 00:24:18.564
This is the divine.

646
00:24:18.564 --> 00:24:20.754
The divine energy, the spirit, call it what you will.

647
00:24:20.754 --> 00:24:23.724
If you turn to it in the service of thanksgiving,

648
00:24:23.724 --> 00:24:25.703
it will radiate you

649
00:24:25.703 --> 00:24:27.324
with knowledge, with wisdom

650
00:24:27.324 --> 00:24:29.153
and it will guide you in the core of your life.

651
00:24:29.153 --> 00:24:31.373
And don't believe me, try it.

652
00:24:31.373 --> 00:24:33.624
You'll be amazed by what happens

653
00:24:33.624 --> 00:24:36.714
if you turn authentically in that way to god.

654
00:24:36.714 --> 00:24:38.963
The second kind of service is service to yourself

655
00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:41.663
but not this dreary new age narcissism which is so boring

656
00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:43.493
but the real service.

657
00:24:43.493 --> 00:24:46.554
And this has five different kinds of practices.

658
00:24:46.554 --> 00:24:47.813
Cool practices

659
00:24:47.813 --> 00:24:49.884
which enable you to calm down.

660
00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.263
I'm very calm now.

661
00:24:51.263 --> 00:24:53.783
Hot practices, which enable you

662
00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:57.233
to keep your heart alive in difficult situations.

663
00:24:57.233 --> 00:24:59.394
Prayer practices that enable you

664
00:24:59.394 --> 00:25:01.014
to align yourself with the beloved

665
00:25:01.014 --> 00:25:03.204
when you can't do the cool or the hot practices

666
00:25:03.204 --> 00:25:04.223
which can happen.

667
00:25:04.223 --> 00:25:05.814
It happened to Jesus in Gethsemane,

668
00:25:05.814 --> 00:25:07.704
when all he could say was not my will

669
00:25:07.704 --> 00:25:08.513
but thy will.

670
00:25:08.513 --> 00:25:11.273
But that was enough to give him the direction

671
00:25:11.273 --> 00:25:13.193
into the last part.

672
00:25:13.193 --> 00:25:16.104
Body practices, physical practices

673
00:25:16.104 --> 00:25:18.444
like the hot yoga i've just written about,

674
00:25:18.444 --> 00:25:20.933
which is a very important self practices.

675
00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:23.903
Which keep you supple to the divine energies.

676
00:25:23.903 --> 00:25:27.233
And, shadow work.

677
00:25:27.233 --> 00:25:30.774
Because without extensive and profound shadow work,

678
00:25:30.774 --> 00:25:33.233
both the mystics and the activists

679
00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:35.213
will remain narcissists.

680
00:25:35.213 --> 00:25:37.163
The mystics will be addicted to transcendence,

681
00:25:37.163 --> 00:25:40.343
and the activists will be addicted to burnout

682
00:25:40.343 --> 00:25:42.623
and exhaustion.

683
00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:44.874
So bringing those two kinds together,

684
00:25:44.874 --> 00:25:47.063
the activist and the mystic requires both doing

685
00:25:47.063 --> 00:25:49.134
extensive shadow work.

686
00:25:49.134 --> 00:25:51.383
The third kind of service is service to all the beings

687
00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.944
in your life.

688
00:25:52.944 --> 00:25:54.984
Everybody you'll ever meet as a manifestation

689
00:25:54.984 --> 00:25:56.964
of the divine.

690
00:25:56.964 --> 00:25:58.554
Especially animals.

691
00:25:58.554 --> 00:25:59.813
Because I think one of the great

692
00:25:59.813 --> 00:26:02.813
real transformations the mother is asking of us

693
00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:05.903
is to look at our horrific treatment of animals

694
00:26:05.903 --> 00:26:07.823
and change it immediately.

695
00:26:07.823 --> 00:26:09.864
The fourth kind of service is to get real

696
00:26:09.864 --> 00:26:11.664
about this birth that's trying to take place

697
00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:12.386
on a global scale

698
00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:15.266
but get real about doing something with other people

699
00:26:15.266 --> 00:26:17.727
in your local community.

700
00:26:17.727 --> 00:26:19.496
So there are two things I suggest.

701
00:26:19.496 --> 00:26:21.746
First, that you get up at three o'clock in the morning,

702
00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:23.636
ask yourself the question,

703
00:26:23.636 --> 00:26:26.486
what breaks your heart the most?

704
00:26:26.486 --> 00:26:28.656
What breaks my heart the most?

705
00:26:28.736 --> 00:26:31.136
What breaks my heart the most?

706
00:26:31.136 --> 00:26:33.237
And when you find

707
00:26:33.237 --> 00:26:35.096
what breaks your heart the most

708
00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:36.506
you are going to find a mission

709
00:26:36.506 --> 00:26:38.516
that you can really devote yourself to.

710
00:26:38.516 --> 00:26:39.926
Then get together with other people

711
00:26:39.926 --> 00:26:41.967
in your local community.

712
00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.826
Who share your heartbreak

713
00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:46.137
or share the passion for a certain cause.

714
00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:49.168
And create what I call networks of grace.

715
00:26:49.168 --> 00:26:51.207
Cells of between six to 15 people.

716
00:26:51.207 --> 00:26:53.607
Look at the back of my book and look on my website

717
00:26:53.607 --> 00:26:56.217
networks of grace and you'll see how to describe it.

718
00:26:56.217 --> 00:26:57.627
Networksofgrace.org.

719
00:26:57.627 --> 00:27:00.778
And start really pooling your resources and passions

720
00:27:00.778 --> 00:27:02.037
to do something.

721
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:06.117
I envisage a global revolution of love and wisdom in action

722
00:27:06.117 --> 00:27:07.708
through these networks of grace.

723
00:27:07.708 --> 00:27:10.078
Amazing things have already been done through them

724
00:27:10.078 --> 00:27:12.388
all over the world so please join.

725
00:27:12.388 --> 00:27:13.347
The fifth kind of service

726
00:27:13.347 --> 00:27:15.298
is facing that you are now,

727
00:27:15.298 --> 00:27:17.217
whether you like it or not,

728
00:27:17.217 --> 00:27:20.908
a global citizen with responsibilities to put

729
00:27:20.908 --> 00:27:24.268
your love into action in the way you vote,

730
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:27.987
in the way you invest, in the way you drive

731
00:27:27.987 --> 00:27:29.188
and what you drive.

732
00:27:29.188 --> 00:27:31.257
In the kind of livelihood you have,

733
00:27:31.257 --> 00:27:36.058
you have to try to become radically congruent.

734
00:27:36.058 --> 00:27:39.027
Otherwise, you are just serving the forces

735
00:27:39.027 --> 00:27:40.858
of destruction and ignorance

736
00:27:40.858 --> 00:27:42.148
and collusion.

737
00:27:42.148 --> 00:27:45.658
We have to become a lot more authentic

738
00:27:45.658 --> 00:27:47.847
on every level.

739
00:27:47.847 --> 00:27:49.828
If you combine these five kinds of services,

740
00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:50.967
my friends,

741
00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:54.718
you will be born into the great transfiguring field

742
00:27:54.718 --> 00:27:56.307
of sacred activism.

743
00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:58.377
And you'll join the great loving army

744
00:27:58.377 --> 00:28:01.348
of sacred activists such as being born all over the world

745
00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:03.808
and is I believe destined to transform

746
00:28:03.808 --> 00:28:05.278
the life of this planet

747
00:28:05.278 --> 00:28:07.497
before it's too late.

748
00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:08.758
<v Regina>Andrew, on that,</v>

749
00:28:08.758 --> 00:28:10.408
I don't think we need to go any further.

750
00:28:10.408 --> 00:28:14.338
Because you're certainly beyond the traditional

751
00:28:14.338 --> 00:28:16.017
type of inspiration here.

752
00:28:16.017 --> 00:28:17.757
I think that you've,

753
00:28:17.757 --> 00:28:19.407
If you haven't helped people delineate

754
00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:21.928
that we can't ignore this any longer within themselves,

755
00:28:21.928 --> 00:28:24.138
then it's not going to happen.

756
00:28:24.138 --> 00:28:26.968
<v ->I think</v>

757
00:28:26.968 --> 00:28:28.347
that what is going to happen

758
00:28:28.347 --> 00:28:31.467
is the mother is going to give us every chance.

759
00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.837
But that's not going to look sweet.

760
00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:35.458
She's going to bitch-slap us.

761
00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:40.137
As hard as it takes to get us awake.

762
00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:44.037
My profoundest prayer is that we can awake

763
00:28:44.037 --> 00:28:46.827
before the devastation is too great.

764
00:28:46.827 --> 00:28:48.837
And I'm going to do everything I can

765
00:28:48.837 --> 00:28:50.427
to help that awakening happen.

766
00:28:50.427 --> 00:28:52.377
But everybody listening must realize

767
00:28:52.377 --> 00:28:56.338
that we are now going into the storm

768
00:28:56.338 --> 00:28:59.727
of the greatest crisis of our entire history.

769
00:28:59.727 --> 00:29:02.278
And that everything is possible.

770
00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:05.547
And that eveything is at stake.

771
00:29:05.547 --> 00:29:07.467
(new age music)

772
00:29:07.467 --> 00:29:09.297
<v ->Andrew has offered over 30 books.</v>

773
00:29:09.297 --> 00:29:12.658
His most recent being "Hope: A guide to Sacred Activism".

774
00:29:12.658 --> 00:29:14.907
Most of which you can find on Amazon.com

775
00:29:14.907 --> 00:29:16.798
or through other major book sellers.

776
00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:19.168
I think we all need to hear such a message now.

777
00:29:19.168 --> 00:29:21.418
Because our participation is desperately needed

778
00:29:21.418 --> 00:29:23.818
to create our new path for humanity.

779
00:29:23.818 --> 00:29:25.617
