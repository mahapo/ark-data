00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.650 line:15% 
(intense, percussive music)

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.607
<v ->I want to prepare you before watching this video.</v>

3
00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.551
The subject is dark, but I felt it was worth speaking of

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:13.524
because it could be useful to anyone who is

5
00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:15.359
considering joining the military,

6
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.123
or who is already enlisted.

7
00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:18.883
The implications are deep.

8
00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:21.812
Douglas Dietrich was a military research librarian

9
00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:23.139
with a high clearance

10
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.810
for the purpose of acquiring access

11
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.484
to ancient documents and books

12
00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.457
containing Satanic rituals,

13
00:00:28.457 --> 00:00:30.014
which he says are practiced

14
00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:32.286
by many high-ranking military officers.

15
00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:35.006
He speaks frankly about working under an officer

16
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.325
who was also known as a Satanic Priest.

17
00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.347
Dietrich explains that

18
00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:41.949
it was the invocation of spirits by the Japanese

19
00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.506
in World War Two that prompted

20
00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:47.095
U.S. Military involvement in the summoning of entities,

21
00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:48.279
including demons.

22
00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.794
It's a pleasure to have you here, Douglas.

23
00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:55.132
I, I was, certainly your speech was eye-opening.

24
00:00:55.132 --> 00:00:58.268
I think a lot of people that are watching this right now

25
00:00:58.268 --> 00:01:00.615
have been exposed to a tremendous amount of information.

26
00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.298
Especially of this nature, of a conspiracy nature.

27
00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.592
Both on this site and other sites.

28
00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:08.981
And yet what you brought to the table yesterday,

29
00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:11.754
I think, was new and surprising for a number of people.

30
00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:14.186
And I have to say, part of the reason

31
00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.436
I wanted to talk to you about this in particular

32
00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:19.135
is that I think the cracks in the other systems

33
00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:20.660
that are beginning to crumble,

34
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.519
which really has to do with more insidious practices

35
00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:24.756
from the inside,

36
00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:26.328
have been revealed.

37
00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.190
We know about the (laughs) financial system,

38
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.161
political system,

39
00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:34.314
to a stretch, the educational system, and so forth.

40
00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:36.378
Religions, but now we're talking military.

41
00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:37.727
<v ->Right.</v>

42
00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:42.516
And, so it's an interesting perspective

43
00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.833
because I don't think that a lot of people understand

44
00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:50.430
that the military is a huge bureaucracy in the United States,

45
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.909
and what we've done is we've kind of

46
00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:55.603
gone through various mutations and swings

47
00:01:55.603 --> 00:01:57.016
in the American culture,

48
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:00.275
where, unlike other cultures where there's been

49
00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:04.200
a tradition of military service and military history,

50
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.130
America's an extremely young culture,

51
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.170
and America's culture was far more of a pioneer culture,

52
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.372
far more of an enterprising culture.

53
00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.418
And the military has been essentially

54
00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:15.617
peripheral to it.

55
00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:17.778
Certainly when my father joined the Navy,

56
00:02:17.778 --> 00:02:20.476
he joined the Navy before Pearl Harbor,

57
00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:24.263
and that was at a time when the greensward

58
00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:27.441
of every major urban metropolis in The United States

59
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:29.297
would have signs that said,

60
00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:31.409
"Sailors and Dogs, Keep off the Grass."

61
00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.223
So, at that point in history--

62
00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:35.238
<v Regina>It was more like merchant marines</v>

63
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.123
or something.

64
00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:38.470
I mean, in terms of people's perception of military.

65
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.611
<v ->That's correct.</v>

66
00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.813
It was, well, it was actually...

67
00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:45.371
That's a good way of putting it, but it was also

68
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:47.519
people who would otherwise be in jail.

69
00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:49.850
And these were just welfare bums.

70
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.122
Basically, these were people who were like,

71
00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:54.586
too lazy to go out and enterprise,

72
00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:56.026
and get an honest job,

73
00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:58.063
and it was looked on as the loser's option.

74
00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.337
And...

75
00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.132
So there wasn't this tremendous professional context.

76
00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:07.513
There was no warrior class of Prussian Junkers,

77
00:03:07.513 --> 00:03:11.118
or Samurai, or some kind of--
<v Regina>Yes, very good point.</v>

78
00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:14.471
<v ->Yeah, and as a result, what you had was this kind of</v>

79
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.805
very bizarre perspective of,

80
00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:20.331
"Okay well, the losers go into, into this field."

81
00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:22.309
So that's the way it was before the war,

82
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.059
and then during the war of course,

83
00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.484
you had this tremendous mobilization.

84
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.241
You had the concept of a "professional" military develop.

85
00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:34.693
But, because of the draft of the second world war,

86
00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.634
they could pick and choose who they wanted,

87
00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:39.465
and, and they certainly did so.

88
00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:43.002
Then, when the big demobilization came,

89
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:46.116
then you had a kind of swing back into the direction

90
00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:49.294
that it was before, where you had kind of like,

91
00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:50.713
"Well, who would go into that

92
00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:52.356
"unless it was a state of war?"

93
00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:54.632
And as a result, the,

94
00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:55.983
the draft continued.

95
00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:58.116
Which was part of that wartime paradigm.

96
00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.921
And with the cessation of the draft,

97
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:02.691
is where we've come into the military

98
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:04.941
that I'm basically telling you about.

99
00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:07.842
Because, well, obviously, I was born in 1966,

100
00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:12.046
and what I grew up seeing when I was a

101
00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:13.623
Department of Defense librarian,

102
00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.810
when I started off as a librarian's aide,

103
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.595
I was essentially a teenager, at 17 years of age.

104
00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:21.329
Before even legal drinking age.

105
00:04:22.146 --> 00:04:24.230
What I started off as was a,

106
00:04:25.143 --> 00:04:28.865
somebody who was exposed to the post-Vietnam military,

107
00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:32.898
post-draft military, where their biggest personnel problems

108
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.544
was, "How do we get people in?"

109
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.431
And that's where you had more and more of a veering

110
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:39.863
towards the quote unquote "professional".

111
00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.494
You come in here again, and we're gonna

112
00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:42.817
pay for your education.

113
00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:44.204
But it was very much a sham,

114
00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:45.360
because all of the,

115
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:48.293
the so-called G.I. Bill,

116
00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:50.635
which World War Two G.I.s were able to take care of,

117
00:04:50.635 --> 00:04:55.635
was no longer proportionately rewarding.

118
00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.539
Because the modern economy negated your ability

119
00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.415
to go to any college you wanted.

120
00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:02.111
You would be going to a community college.

121
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:02.944
<v Regina>Fascinating.</v>

122
00:05:02.944 --> 00:05:04.384
<v ->If you had never been in the militar--</v>

123
00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:05.865
You're not gonna go to an Ivy League,

124
00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:08.564
you're not gonna go to some college of your choice.

125
00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:11.285
You're going to be taking what little they give you,

126
00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:14.967
and do what you can with it.

127
00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:16.385
And these days, it's infinitely worse.

128
00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:18.039
It's like dollar for dollar.

129
00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.660
You put a dollar in, we'll put a dollar in

130
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.289
towards your college.

131
00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.612
And since the average military person

132
00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.820
is literally on welfare.

133
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.699
By that I mean literally, many military people

134
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.878
are given food stamps.

135
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.270
That there's nothing they're going to be putting

136
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.155
towards college.

137
00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:31.083
So...

138
00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Regina>So that's a sales job.</v>

139
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.153
<v ->Yes, it's a sales job.</v>

140
00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:36.427
And as a result, you get people, especially now,

141
00:05:36.427 --> 00:05:38.569
who literally, once again,

142
00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.839
are given choices between jail or the military.

143
00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.582
Quite, quite a few times.
<v Regina>Yes, yes.</v>

144
00:05:43.582 --> 00:05:46.389
<v ->And that's what I was trying to emphasize last night,</v>

145
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.480
in terms of,

146
00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:50.015
there's this mystique now.

147
00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.267
It's a post-Vietnam kind of overreaction

148
00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:55.519
where during the Vietnam War, the entire military

149
00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:59.700
was vociferously repudiated,

150
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.408
and everyone was a baby killer,

151
00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:04.755
and then of course there was this kind of guilt

152
00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:06.526
in the post-Vietnam era, where,

153
00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:09.427
"Oh, how can we treat the homecoming G.I.s like that?"

154
00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:12.777
They're, approximately nine percent of the population

155
00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:16.626
is veterans, but 60 percent of the population's homeless

156
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.534
are veterans.

157
00:06:17.534 --> 00:06:19.347
They constitute, they constitute only nine percent

158
00:06:19.347 --> 00:06:21.086
of the American population, approximately,

159
00:06:21.086 --> 00:06:23.565
but they constitute 60 percent of America's homeless.

160
00:06:23.827 --> 00:06:25.660
So then everybody starts saying, "Oh how can we do that?"

161
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.168
So now it's like everyone who's in the military is a saint.

162
00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:29.489
(laughs)

163
00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:32.509
And, so what needs to be addressed is a balance.

164
00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.663
<v Regina>Yes, and you go the movie theaters now,</v>

165
00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:36.135
and they're selling really hard

166
00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:37.874
to get people into the military.

167
00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:38.781
<v ->Yes.</v>

168
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.444
<v Regina>I mean, it is, you basically</v>

169
00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:43.239
have your PlayStation, and you're bombing cultures

170
00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:45.511
from halfway around the world,

171
00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:48.785
and you're, at the same time, saving their little children

172
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:53.785
to whichever rock musician has agreed to do the contract

173
00:06:53.928 --> 00:06:54.804
for that piece.

174
00:06:54.804 --> 00:06:56.969
And it's really the licensing fees, and all--

175
00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.006
It's just amazing what it's become.

176
00:06:59.006 --> 00:07:02.653
It's become, as you say, sort of this glossy, sexy

177
00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:04.743
enterprise that doesn't deliver when you get there.

178
00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:05.767
<v ->Right, yes.</v>

179
00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:07.047
And that's very sad.

180
00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:09.299
Because I notice like, for instance, with the,

181
00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:11.571
The Battle of Los Angeles, that film,

182
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:14.920
which ironically came out after I was

183
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.445
basically organizing my Roswell and the Rising Sun DVD.

184
00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:24.230
What I was talking about was the Japanese war efforts

185
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.319
in World War Two.

186
00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.529
The Americans were doing their best with a propaganda blitz

187
00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:30.192
during World War Two to hide the fact

188
00:07:30.192 --> 00:07:34.769
that the Japanese made any inways into the American coast.

189
00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:38.341
So one of the things that occurred during World War Two

190
00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:39.601
was of course the Battle of Los Angeles.

191
00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:42.716
I've explained bits and pieces of that in my DVD.

192
00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:45.381
Of course, the DVD wasn't dedicated to that specifically,

193
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.265
but the science-fiction film that was released recently

194
00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:52.859
was, thankfully, not based on 1942's Battle of Los Angeles,

195
00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:56.506
but it just took advantage of that historical incident

196
00:07:56.506 --> 00:08:01.338
to make a two and a half hour Marine Corps recruiting ad.

197
00:08:01.338 --> 00:08:02.213
<v Regina>That's exactly what it was.</v>

198
00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:04.932
It makes it sexy and glamorous, heroic.
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

199
00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:06.607
<v Regina>That's not the reality of what you're seeing,</v>

200
00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:08.997
of these poor, shattered individuals when they come home

201
00:08:08.997 --> 00:08:10.458
from a few tours of duty.
<v ->That's--</v>

202
00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:12.666
<v Regina>And you know, you've been there.</v>

203
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:13.476
You've been there twice.

204
00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:14.500
<v ->Well, I think we all know that,</v>

205
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.888
and I think that's almost kind of like,

206
00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:19.161
that would be belaboring the obvious.

207
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:19.928
<v Regina>Yes it would.</v>

208
00:08:19.928 --> 00:08:22.211
<v ->And I think what I shocked you, or the audience with</v>

209
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:26.595
last night, was more or less the aspects of ritual Satanism.

210
00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:27.939
<v Regina>Well, that's what I wanted to get into,</v>

211
00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:29.518
is before it was kind of God and country.

212
00:08:29.518 --> 00:08:31.011
World War Two, God and country.

213
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:31.704
<v ->Right.</v>

214
00:08:31.704 --> 00:08:33.006
<v Regina>Everybody came home and you know,</v>

215
00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:36.206
you came home with having done your duty to both.

216
00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.367
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>God and country.</v>

217
00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:39.021
It's changed since then.

218
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:39.896
<v ->Yes.</v>

219
00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:41.527
<v Regina>What's at the real core of it?</v>

220
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:44.961
Including, we're talking, four-star Brigadier Generals?

221
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:46.072
<v ->Yes, that's correct.</v>

222
00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:48.215
<v Regina>Is really another story entirely,</v>

223
00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:49.676
and that's where I'd like to get into it.

224
00:08:49.676 --> 00:08:52.002
And I'd like to start with the bit you told us about

225
00:08:52.002 --> 00:08:54.987
the Japanese, and invoking the spirits during World War Two,

226
00:08:54.987 --> 00:08:56.406
which you alluded to a moment ago.

227
00:08:56.406 --> 00:08:58.454
That, we tried to, the press said

228
00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.844
they weren't really making an inroads in general.

229
00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:02.496
But let's talk about where that's not true.

230
00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:05.761
<v ->Yeah, well, in terms of lack of inroads in general,</v>

231
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.799
one of the,

232
00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:10.154
one of the, by that I was referring to what they did

233
00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:12.033
on the American front,

234
00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:15.286
and certainly what had happened was that the Japanese

235
00:09:15.286 --> 00:09:18.181
not only invaded Alaska, which was,

236
00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:20.949
it took the Americans enormous amount of effort

237
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:22.036
to respond to,

238
00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:25.801
but also they had bombed America

239
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:27.226
with 10,000 balloon bombs

240
00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:30.073
that the American government entirely hid

241
00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:32.116
from the American public, entirely dismissed.

242
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.492
But the Japanese got enormous strategic value

243
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:36.975
out of that, because they were mapping

244
00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:38.036
the wind currents.

245
00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:40.249
Because that was what they were going to use later on

246
00:09:40.249 --> 00:09:42.223
to disperse biological weapons.

247
00:09:42.223 --> 00:09:45.294
And by mapping the wind currents, they were able to

248
00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:50.294
present the Americans with a wind-mapping situation

249
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.203
because all of the wind, especially the jet stream,

250
00:09:55.203 --> 00:09:57.272
blows only from Japan towards America.

251
00:09:57.272 --> 00:09:58.712
It does not (laughs) reverse.

252
00:09:58.712 --> 00:09:59.918
And--
<v Regina>As we know right now</v>

253
00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:01.432
with radiation, yeah.
<v ->That's correct.</v>

254
00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:02.360
That's correct.

255
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.517
And so the Japanese were able to threaten the Americans

256
00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:08.226
into concessions using that,

257
00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:09.741
and that's what I go into in my DVD,

258
00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:10.967
Roswell and the Rising Sun.

259
00:10:10.967 --> 00:10:13.645
So these are, these are aspects on the more mundane

260
00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.151
or secular level of warfare.

261
00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:17.676
But on the occult level of warfare,

262
00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:19.703
when it came to the defense of their homeland,

263
00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.207
what I was speaking to last night,

264
00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:22.860
something the Americans went

265
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.131
overwhelmingly out of their way to hide,

266
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:27.126
and the American high command found that

267
00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:29.494
truly impressive, truly terrifying.

268
00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:32.054
Moreso than the threat of mass genocide

269
00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:34.049
by biological weapons on their homeland.

270
00:10:34.049 --> 00:10:35.883
And that was the fact that the Japanese

271
00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:39.574
could invoke, using the sacrifice of the self,

272
00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:42.422
the spirits of their ancestors,

273
00:10:42.422 --> 00:10:43.690
the spirits of their gods,

274
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.346
based on their history of having done so.

275
00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:50.410
We have to remember that in 1941,

276
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.069
Japan was 2,600 years old, as a civilization.

277
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:56.948
And still today, they have the longest

278
00:10:56.948 --> 00:11:00.062
unbroken line of a dynastic family.

279
00:11:00.462 --> 00:11:01.497
On Earth.

280
00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:06.525
Basically, certainly before World War Two,

281
00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:09.426
you could legitimately say that

282
00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:13.371
every single person in Japan, in one way or another,

283
00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:16.384
indirectly was related to the Emperor.

284
00:11:16.827 --> 00:11:19.739
They were, in a very real sense, one huge family.

285
00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:24.581
And so that creates a powerful bond,

286
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:28.390
probably closer than any other large ethnic group,

287
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.135
where they could mobilize a kind of

288
00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.188
monofocal concentration.

289
00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.147
And that's exactly what happened,

290
00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:39.867
there was a spiritual mobilization by

291
00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:43.536
Kuromaku, or The Black Curtain, as it was known,

292
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:47.502
which was a military organization of Shinto Priests.

293
00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:51.801
And using the Ryobu Shinto Kami way,

294
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:54.938
meaning, Kamis are the divine spirits of Japan.

295
00:11:54.938 --> 00:11:55.929
The nature spirits.

296
00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:57.924
Everything in Japan,

297
00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:03.844
like a, like a particularly well-eroded rock,

298
00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:06.924
a particularly gnarled or wizened tree,

299
00:12:06.924 --> 00:12:08.102
has a spirit.

300
00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:10.370
This is translated into their modern technology,

301
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.086
where they feel that inanimate objects,

302
00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:16.429
such as certain well-developed prototypes

303
00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:17.751
such as robotics,

304
00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:22.618
robotic constructs, can imbue a spirit.

305
00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:25.664
So it translates into the modern era.

306
00:12:25.664 --> 00:12:29.430
And, but what they did with the mass Kamikaze

307
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.632
war effort, which the American high command ordered

308
00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:35.413
all the way down the chain of command,

309
00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:36.694
all the way down the line.

310
00:12:36.694 --> 00:12:39.359
No one back home heard about the Kamikazes

311
00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.407
any more than they heard about

312
00:12:41.407 --> 00:12:42.730
the balloon bombing.

313
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.404
It was, the U.S. government chose to respond

314
00:12:44.404 --> 00:12:48.351
to these Japanese strategems with total blackout,

315
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.600
total silencing.
<v Regina>Where did the</v>

316
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.505
balloon bombing occur, by the way?

317
00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:53.994
<v ->That occurred all throughout the Pacific Northwest,</v>

318
00:12:53.994 --> 00:12:56.222
in particular, was probably the hardest-hit regions

319
00:12:56.222 --> 00:12:58.292
where massive forest fires occurred.

320
00:12:58.292 --> 00:13:00.404
We're talking about massive firestorms,

321
00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:01.929
where the Americans had to respond

322
00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:04.211
with smoke jumpers,

323
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:05.950
which were sent in to put the fires out.

324
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.692
And what they responded to with,

325
00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:10.014
because they wanted to keep it secret,

326
00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:12.958
and make it look like there was no military assault

327
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.056
on the American homeland,

328
00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:16.114
what they did was they took all these African-Americans

329
00:13:16.114 --> 00:13:17.650
out of the Conservation Corps,

330
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.090
which had been set up by Roosevelt,

331
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.224
and they trained them in smoke jumping.

332
00:13:21.224 --> 00:13:22.855
And they had them parachute in

333
00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:24.690
to fight these enormous forest fires,

334
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.866
but they had what they called, "Black Parachutes".

335
00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:28.359
They weren't colored black, but they gave them

336
00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.511
only to the black men.

337
00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:31.420
These were, they said, "We're short on silk,"

338
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.692
and they just gave them these very small parachutes,

339
00:13:33.692 --> 00:13:37.340
which have enormous impact on the body.

340
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.454
When you unfurl a small parachute that can literally,

341
00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:43.122
the shock effect of a small parachute opening up,

342
00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:46.258
can shatter every bone in a man's body.

343
00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:49.350
And half of these African-Americans would just

344
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.505
burn alive in the firestorms because

345
00:13:51.505 --> 00:13:53.126
when the parachute opened up, and I have--

346
00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:55.014
Actually, I have photographs of this that I,

347
00:13:55.014 --> 00:13:55.963
that I've shown.

348
00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:58.541
You know, they would just be hanging limp,

349
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.887
and totally helpless because their bones were shattered,

350
00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:02.403
and by the time they hit the ground,

351
00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:04.163
they would just be into the middle of the fire, and burning.

352
00:14:04.163 --> 00:14:06.412
<v Regina>That's so, yeah.</v>
<v ->But, and that of course, yeah--</v>

353
00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:07.394
<v Regina>I just wanted to ask you,</v>

354
00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:08.685
'cause we didn't go into it earlier.
<v ->Right, understood.</v>

355
00:14:08.685 --> 00:14:11.105
But in terms of the Japanese home islands,

356
00:14:11.105 --> 00:14:14.189
what was going on was that the Americans

357
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:17.633
were basically confronted of a sudden with the fact that,

358
00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:19.275
"Well, the Japanese are killing themselves,

359
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:23.691
"and they're making enormous inroads in terms of damage

360
00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:25.056
"to our men and equipment."

361
00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:27.168
But it was known that no matter--

362
00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:28.907
Because they had a smaller population,

363
00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:33.440
no matter how many ships or men they took down,

364
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.534
could they conceivably make enough of an erosive dent

365
00:14:36.534 --> 00:14:39.477
in the American war machine where this would stop it.

366
00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:41.845
And the Japanese themselves weren't counting on that,

367
00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:43.797
it's what the Japanese were going to call up.

368
00:14:43.797 --> 00:14:47.114
And because 700 years before World War Two,

369
00:14:47.114 --> 00:14:49.673
they had managed to defeat an overwhelming

370
00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:51.872
and technologically advanced enemy,

371
00:14:51.872 --> 00:14:53.034
the Mongol Empire,

372
00:14:53.034 --> 00:14:55.402
which had taken Korean engineers,

373
00:14:55.402 --> 00:14:57.652
were some of the most advanced in the world.

374
00:14:57.652 --> 00:14:59.795
The Koreans had not only had gunpowder,

375
00:14:59.795 --> 00:15:02.622
but the Koreans also had invented the printing press

376
00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:04.062
long before the Europeans,

377
00:15:04.062 --> 00:15:06.131
and were therefore able to technologically

378
00:15:07.811 --> 00:15:10.571
pass on their mechanistic inventions

379
00:15:10.571 --> 00:15:13.079
throughout their society in such a way that

380
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.532
they would have been a major force in the world stage

381
00:15:15.532 --> 00:15:17.850
if it hadn't been for the Mongol invasions.

382
00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:20.129
And so the Mongols incorporated their

383
00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:21.659
engineering genius.

384
00:15:22.411 --> 00:15:24.822
The giant riverboat building technology of the Chinese,

385
00:15:24.822 --> 00:15:27.189
these riverboats were twice the size of any

386
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:31.108
European ship, and well over 200 feet long.

387
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:34.603
But they were, the idea of using riverboats on the high seas

388
00:15:34.603 --> 00:15:37.173
might seem ridiculous, but the distance between

389
00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:39.200
Japan and Korea, and the Asian mainland

390
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.405
is very, very small.

391
00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:43.369
And so it was a, it was an easy gamble.

392
00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:45.929
It was a sensible, rational gamble.

393
00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:50.133
And the Koreans used literally thousands of these ships,

394
00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.574
as I said, it was 40,000 ships.

395
00:15:52.574 --> 00:15:54.825
You wouldn't see anything like that until D-Day.

396
00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:59.124
To transport tens of thousands of Mongol Marines,

397
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:02.949
they had advanced gunpowder, and what they would call,

398
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:05.341
instead of cannon balls, catapult balls,

399
00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:07.197
which they were overwhelming the Japanese with

400
00:16:07.197 --> 00:16:10.071
before the Japanese could even meet them face to face.

401
00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:12.764
And as a result, the Emperor of Japan just

402
00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.770
got onto his knees and prayed to the gods

403
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.486
of his ancestors for an answer.

404
00:16:16.486 --> 00:16:19.803
And it was out of nowhere, spontaneously,

405
00:16:19.803 --> 00:16:23.281
that you had a divine win,

406
00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:24.774
as the Japanese interpret it, occur.

407
00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:29.774
A major hurricane, a typhoon, as they call it in Asia,

408
00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:31.226
came out of nowhere.

409
00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:33.754
20-meter waves, 150-mile-per-hour winds,

410
00:16:33.754 --> 00:16:35.802
and 70,000 men went into the sea.

411
00:16:35.802 --> 00:16:39.604
And no naval disaster has ever matched that.

412
00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:43.321
It would be as if the entire invasion force at D-Day sank.

413
00:16:43.321 --> 00:16:47.620
And so the Japanese felt that they were able to

414
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.034
channel this again if they made enough of a self-sacrifice,

415
00:16:51.034 --> 00:16:52.847
and so when they confronted the Americans,

416
00:16:52.847 --> 00:16:53.999
"We can do this,"

417
00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:56.068
and the Americans had seen enough

418
00:16:56.068 --> 00:16:59.502
in terms of the, what was almost to the Americans

419
00:16:59.502 --> 00:17:01.987
a supernatural effect, of what the Japanese were doing.

420
00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.526
Like I said, breaking the sound barrier, even though

421
00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:06.861
that was a technological barrier, breakthrough,

422
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.397
using their piloted rocket bombs,

423
00:17:08.397 --> 00:17:13.397
the Ohka missiles that I had shown in the presentation.

424
00:17:13.944 --> 00:17:15.896
To the Americans, the breaking of the sound barrier

425
00:17:15.896 --> 00:17:17.730
was so new in terms of physics,

426
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.086
this was almost magical.

427
00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:20.076
<v Regina>Yeah, mystical, yeah.</v>

428
00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:22.775
<v ->And they were impressed enough where they said,</v>

429
00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:26.881
"Well, let's send a, Doctor Compton over there

430
00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:30.198
"and we'll see if the Japanese can do this."

431
00:17:30.198 --> 00:17:32.311
So there was a cease fire that was declared.

432
00:17:32.311 --> 00:17:33.893
There was that 18-minute ceremony

433
00:17:33.893 --> 00:17:35.291
on the battleship Missouri, which,

434
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:37.521
it would take me several minutes to go into,

435
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.906
as to why that was so farcical.

436
00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:40.837
The Japanese were still fighting the Soviets at the time,

437
00:17:40.837 --> 00:17:42.950
that the Soviets were also on the Missouri, signing that.

438
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.926
Nobody who was present at that ceremony

439
00:17:45.926 --> 00:17:48.570
took that ceremony as anything other than a cease fire.

440
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.309
Everyone was still legally at war.

441
00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:53.423
Title 38 of the U.S. Code, which is equivalent to

442
00:17:53.423 --> 00:17:55.321
an executive order, it is law,

443
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.905
states that for benefits from injuries incurred

444
00:17:58.905 --> 00:18:00.174
during World War Two,

445
00:18:00.174 --> 00:18:02.990
all of those benefits can be accrued and claimed

446
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.935
up until December 31st, 1946.

447
00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:09.647
So certainly, the government themselves, by law,

448
00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:11.651
does not think the war ended in 1945.

449
00:18:11.651 --> 00:18:12.623
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

450
00:18:12.623 --> 00:18:15.065
<v ->But the point that I'm making is that</v>

451
00:18:15.065 --> 00:18:16.643
after the surrender ceremony,

452
00:18:16.643 --> 00:18:19.427
the Americans on Okinawa were watching and waiting,

453
00:18:19.427 --> 00:18:22.466
and the Kamikaze did develop.

454
00:18:22.466 --> 00:18:24.419
And that, worse than that, the Japanese seemed to be

455
00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:25.463
able to direct it.

456
00:18:25.463 --> 00:18:26.391
They directed it exactly--

457
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:27.415
<v Regina>When you say Kamikaze,</v>

458
00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:28.942
this could confuse people.
<v ->Understood.</v>

459
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.380
<v Regina>Because they're thinking Kamikaze pilots.</v>

460
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.407
<v ->Understood, yes.
<v Regina>Versus what, the spirit</v>

461
00:18:32.407 --> 00:18:34.082
you're speaking of.
<v ->The, the, that's correct.</v>

462
00:18:34.082 --> 00:18:35.629
The divine wind is what I'm speaking of.

463
00:18:35.629 --> 00:18:39.831
And the Kamikaze pilots and suicide torpedo men,

464
00:18:39.831 --> 00:18:41.185
it was not only in the air,

465
00:18:41.185 --> 00:18:43.809
but whatever self-destructive vehicles they were in,

466
00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:46.987
including explosive motorboats, were known as Shinyo,

467
00:18:46.987 --> 00:18:50.306
there were various other mediums of auto-immolation

468
00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:54.368
to self-sacrifice the warrior

469
00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:56.417
to bring forth the spirit of the gods,

470
00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:57.973
to invoke them.

471
00:18:57.973 --> 00:19:01.984
And so when the Kamikaze took that name,

472
00:19:01.984 --> 00:19:05.238
it was simply from the name of the divine manifestation

473
00:19:05.238 --> 00:19:07.423
they were trying to trigger.

474
00:19:07.423 --> 00:19:09.770
Trying to evoke.

475
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.762
<v Regina>Thank you for clarifying.</v>

476
00:19:10.762 --> 00:19:11.572
Yes.
<v ->Thank you.</v>

477
00:19:11.572 --> 00:19:15.358
And, and so the Americans had captured Okinawa.

478
00:19:15.358 --> 00:19:19.326
They had basically, because no invasion was gonna

479
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.883
take place 'cause of a cease fire,

480
00:19:20.883 --> 00:19:22.601
they didn't have the amount of men and materials

481
00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:23.667
that would have been there,

482
00:19:23.667 --> 00:19:26.900
but there were enough there to suffer the damage.

483
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.267
It was equivalent to like a nuclear test

484
00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:30.868
where they line up all of the ships,

485
00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:32.755
and then blow the hydrogen bomb to see

486
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.793
if an entire fleet can be blown up.

487
00:19:34.793 --> 00:19:36.957
That, if you remember Bikini.
<v Regina>Mhmm, yes.</v>

488
00:19:36.957 --> 00:19:39.805
<v ->And that, this was the equivalent of that.</v>

489
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:41.555
But the Americans left live guinea pigs.

490
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.730
They left a whole bunch of men stationed on Okinawa

491
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.085
'cause they had just invaded it,

492
00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:50.085
and when Typhoon Louise, as the Americans titled it,

493
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.831
manifested on October 9th,

494
00:19:53.831 --> 00:19:58.831
and by all logic of meteorology and wind currents,

495
00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:01.308
should have passed away from Okinawa

496
00:20:01.308 --> 00:20:03.655
between Taiwan and China,

497
00:20:03.655 --> 00:20:06.747
and just on into the ocean and just dissipated,

498
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.808
it didn't conform to any meteorological patterns

499
00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:10.715
known to man.

500
00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:12.924
It manifested out of nowhere,

501
00:20:12.924 --> 00:20:14.843
was directed, came straight toward--

502
00:20:14.843 --> 00:20:16.357
That was the only way it was written of

503
00:20:16.357 --> 00:20:17.724
in the American (laughs) files.

504
00:20:17.724 --> 00:20:19.802
It was directed, they said.

505
00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:21.818
It went straight towards Buckner Bay,

506
00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:22.821
which the Americans had taken

507
00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.051
the main Okinawan port, and named it after

508
00:20:25.051 --> 00:20:27.813
a American general who had been killed taking it.

509
00:20:27.813 --> 00:20:29.115
A Marine Corps general who'd been killed

510
00:20:29.115 --> 00:20:29.989
taking Okinawa.

511
00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:31.450
They renamed it after him, Buckner Bay.

512
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.284
Yeah, right towards Buckner Bay,

513
00:20:33.284 --> 00:20:37.957
and I don't know if I got to the damage on the ships

514
00:20:37.957 --> 00:20:40.324
last night, I gave some visual clue of it.

515
00:20:40.324 --> 00:20:42.318
I told about what happened on the island itself.

516
00:20:42.318 --> 00:20:44.997
<v Regina>Yes, the loss.</v>
<v ->The damage, yes the loss of over</v>

517
00:20:44.997 --> 00:20:47.332
80 percent of their housing,

518
00:20:47.332 --> 00:20:49.956
their medical supplies, their food,

519
00:20:49.956 --> 00:20:53.816
all of the invasion materials that were left over,

520
00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:56.570
that they hadn't transported back to the United States.

521
00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.538
Hundreds of infantry landing vehic, ships.

522
00:21:02.368 --> 00:21:05.153
Landing patrol boats, the tank transports,

523
00:21:05.153 --> 00:21:06.925
all the rest of them were just totally demolished.

524
00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:08.524
Planes were swept away out to sea,

525
00:21:08.524 --> 00:21:09.633
never to be recovered.

526
00:21:09.633 --> 00:21:10.700
At least 60 of them.

527
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.450
But in terms of the ships,

528
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.698
the damage was actually even worse.

529
00:21:13.698 --> 00:21:16.002
We're talking about at least 22 major ships,

530
00:21:16.002 --> 00:21:18.059
as I showed you with that photograph of aircraft carriers

531
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:20.204
dragging anchor.

532
00:21:20.204 --> 00:21:23.244
The winds were just supernatural.

533
00:21:23.244 --> 00:21:25.313
And so this was the equivalent, I mean,

534
00:21:25.313 --> 00:21:28.448
I think we all realize that a volcano

535
00:21:28.448 --> 00:21:30.700
has far more power in it

536
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.673
than hundreds of atomic bombs.

537
00:21:32.673 --> 00:21:33.994
This was like that.

538
00:21:33.994 --> 00:21:36.406
This was, this was a natural meteorological phenomena

539
00:21:36.406 --> 00:21:38.795
that was the equivalent of multiple nuclear weapons.

540
00:21:38.795 --> 00:21:41.259
<v Regina>Did the military at this time,</v>

541
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.135
the American military at this time,

542
00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.834
suspect or grasp that this was something

543
00:21:45.834 --> 00:21:47.765
of a supernatural nature?

544
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.738
<v ->Absolutely, because what had happened was</v>

545
00:21:49.738 --> 00:21:51.338
with the Showa ultimatum,

546
00:21:51.338 --> 00:21:53.631
and this is something I go into in my DVD,

547
00:21:53.631 --> 00:21:54.985
Roswell and the Rising Sun,

548
00:21:54.985 --> 00:21:57.258
with the Showa ultimatum that was delivered

549
00:21:57.258 --> 00:21:58.879
after the Americans went nuclear,

550
00:21:58.879 --> 00:22:00.393
when the Americans went nuclear with the

551
00:22:00.393 --> 00:22:01.364
atomic bomb.

552
00:22:01.364 --> 00:22:03.294
And this is what I tried to point out to the Americans,

553
00:22:03.294 --> 00:22:06.943
is that, because what they hit were civilian targets,

554
00:22:06.943 --> 00:22:10.889
it had no impact on the Japanese army in the field.

555
00:22:10.889 --> 00:22:13.630
Just as 9-11 and the Pentagon attacks

556
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.042
in no way, shape, or form impacted the U.S. war machine.

557
00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:17.779
<v Regina>Right.</v>

558
00:22:17.779 --> 00:22:19.987
<v ->There was no single U.S. soldier or tank,</v>

559
00:22:19.987 --> 00:22:23.240
or any military asset that was damaged by the 9-11 attacks

560
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.723
on the Pentagon and the twin towers.

561
00:22:24.723 --> 00:22:27.026
The same with Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

562
00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.764
When Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place,

563
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:31.154
they caused untold human suffering.

564
00:22:31.154 --> 00:22:33.244
And what were the Americans killing?

565
00:22:33.244 --> 00:22:37.586
Infants in their cribs, old, old people in their beds,

566
00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:38.470
women and children.

567
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.890
All the men are in the field.

568
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.460
And so all the military assets are still out there

569
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.580
and goin' strong.

570
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.876
The Imperial Japanese Army was hurt not one whit

571
00:22:46.876 --> 00:22:48.359
in function by the atomic bombs,

572
00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:50.246
but by the Americans going nuclear,

573
00:22:50.246 --> 00:22:52.240
they had conducted a terrorist act.

574
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.172
And at that point, the Emperor responded

575
00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:56.859
with an ultimatum concerning the biological weapons.

576
00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:59.045
And what he delivered with that was,

577
00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.901
"And we can summon our ancestors,

578
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:02.714
"and the spirits of our ancestors in such a way

579
00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:05.754
"that we can take your entire fleet down."

580
00:23:05.754 --> 00:23:09.444
And the Americans responded by taking that seriously

581
00:23:09.444 --> 00:23:11.771
because of what they had seen so far,

582
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:14.201
that they had hidden from the American public.

583
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:16.805
They said, "Well let's see if they can pull this off."

584
00:23:16.805 --> 00:23:19.055
And since they had already taken Okinawa,

585
00:23:19.055 --> 00:23:22.094
then they basically had a lotta men laying in wait

586
00:23:22.094 --> 00:23:23.907
who were basically guinea pigs,

587
00:23:23.907 --> 00:23:26.745
and they didn't inform them about it,

588
00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:28.463
but there were scientific observers.

589
00:23:28.463 --> 00:23:30.895
The scientific observers reported back,

590
00:23:30.895 --> 00:23:32.313
"They did it."

591
00:23:32.313 --> 00:23:35.683
Because that, nothing was happening

592
00:23:35.683 --> 00:23:37.657
according to any natural laws.

593
00:23:37.657 --> 00:23:39.096
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->According to all the wind currents,</v>

594
00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:42.489
that, that typhoon should never have manifested.

595
00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:45.239
It should never, not in the way it did.

596
00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:47.724
And it should never increased in intensity the way it did.

597
00:23:47.724 --> 00:23:51.288
It should never have maneuvered the way it did.

598
00:23:51.288 --> 00:23:53.260
Almost as if it had a mind of its own, and

599
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.695
and hit directly the port in which all of the invasion assets

600
00:23:56.695 --> 00:23:58.946
had been parked and ported.

601
00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:01.387
It was just, it was truly supernatural.

602
00:24:01.387 --> 00:24:02.358
And--

603
00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:03.937
<v Regina>Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.</v>

604
00:24:03.937 --> 00:24:06.860
<v ->And, and October 15th, the Americans had to organize--</v>

605
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.716
In 1945, the Americans had to organize

606
00:24:08.716 --> 00:24:10.273
Operation Magic Carpet

607
00:24:10.273 --> 00:24:14.453
to process 7,500 critically injured (laughs) American troops

608
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.733
back to the United States.

609
00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:17.962
<v Regina>So now they're taking this seriously,</v>

610
00:24:17.962 --> 00:24:20.256
and because there's so much to cover

611
00:24:20.256 --> 00:24:22.144
in the time we have left,

612
00:24:22.144 --> 00:24:26.922
let's forward it to where the occult started,

613
00:24:26.922 --> 00:24:30.431
this respect for the occult, let's call it that.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

614
00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:32.777
<v Regina>Started, really becoming entrenched</v>

615
00:24:32.777 --> 00:24:34.313
in the U.S. Military,

616
00:24:34.313 --> 00:24:35.849
and how that began showing itself.

617
00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:36.586
<v ->Well it's interesting.</v>

618
00:24:36.586 --> 00:24:38.494
It was there before, and that's why they took it seriously.

619
00:24:38.494 --> 00:24:41.279
I think what the Japanese manifestation did,

620
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:45.363
was it converted them into a total paradigm

621
00:24:45.363 --> 00:24:46.687
of occult warfare.

622
00:24:46.687 --> 00:24:49.560
Whereas, before it had been a

623
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.723
American aspect, an aspect of American warfare.

624
00:24:52.723 --> 00:24:55.902
And when Colonel Aquino had explained to me that

625
00:24:55.902 --> 00:24:57.992
just as--
<v Regina>Just, tell us who this person is?</v>

626
00:24:57.992 --> 00:25:00.137
<v ->Colonel Michael Aquino was a</v>

627
00:25:00.137 --> 00:25:02.568
psychological warfare expert

628
00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:07.568
who became a big player, and an important figure

629
00:25:08.349 --> 00:25:11.421
in the Defense Intelligence Agency of the U.S. Military.

630
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:14.685
And he wound up working with the World Affairs Council,

631
00:25:14.685 --> 00:25:16.573
and on second mint to Nato,

632
00:25:16.573 --> 00:25:18.866
so he had international security clearances,

633
00:25:18.866 --> 00:25:21.351
but he was a practicing Satanist,

634
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:22.865
he had been a member of The Church of Satan

635
00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:24.135
of Anton LaVey.

636
00:25:24.135 --> 00:25:27.346
But unlike Anton LaVey, whose Satanism was more

637
00:25:27.346 --> 00:25:29.243
of a ritual humanism,

638
00:25:29.243 --> 00:25:34.096
a worship of the self, a kind of human potential,

639
00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:35.057
(laughs) if you will.

640
00:25:35.057 --> 00:25:36.379
<v Regina>Right, very hedonistic, by nature.</v>

641
00:25:36.379 --> 00:25:37.285
<v ->Right.</v>

642
00:25:37.285 --> 00:25:40.305
Anton LaVey went towards a theistic--

643
00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:41.350
Excuse me.

644
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.411
Colonel Michael Aquino had a schism with Anton LaVey

645
00:25:44.411 --> 00:25:47.173
because he veered towards a theistic Satanism.

646
00:25:47.173 --> 00:25:51.727
And so he wanted to manifest the forces of The Dark One,

647
00:25:51.727 --> 00:25:52.539
literally.

648
00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:53.957
But he was calling on tradition.

649
00:25:53.957 --> 00:25:56.249
He didn't make this out of whole cloth himself.

650
00:25:56.249 --> 00:25:59.088
What he explained to me, and quite logically,

651
00:25:59.088 --> 00:26:02.190
this analogy is almost hackneyed and overused,

652
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.166
however it's inescapable and actually legitimate.

653
00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:08.420
The United States is indeed the new Roman Empire,

654
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.707
and like the Roman Empire did not create its own divinities

655
00:26:12.707 --> 00:26:15.823
or, or pantheon,

656
00:26:15.823 --> 00:26:18.841
they simply incorporated that of the Greeks

657
00:26:18.841 --> 00:26:19.960
and the Hellenik peoples,

658
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.934
and simply militarized them.

659
00:26:23.144 --> 00:26:27.713
The Americans took the demons that had been invoked

660
00:26:27.713 --> 00:26:31.105
or evoked from the days of John Dee, of the British Empire.

661
00:26:31.105 --> 00:26:33.749
So when John Dee had served his Queen,

662
00:26:33.749 --> 00:26:38.527
of the early days of the incipient global British Empire,

663
00:26:38.527 --> 00:26:43.189
John Dee had been practicing an occult form of evocation

664
00:26:43.189 --> 00:26:44.331
and invocation,

665
00:26:44.331 --> 00:26:48.063
and after that you had it manifest in the more extreme forms

666
00:26:48.063 --> 00:26:49.599
with Aleister Crowley.

667
00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:53.130
But what the British do know of is that

668
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.593
many of the British elite and nobility were members

669
00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:57.471
of what was known as the Hellfire Club.

670
00:26:57.471 --> 00:27:02.471
A kind of hedonistic, very self-indulgent group of

671
00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.808
decadent, upper-class people

672
00:27:04.808 --> 00:27:07.220
who were dialling downstairs, so to speak,

673
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.260
to receive their instructions towards global dominance.

674
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.790
And I think many British people have the feeling that

675
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.274
this kind of all too

676
00:27:17.454 --> 00:27:19.091
meteoric rise to preeminence,

677
00:27:19.091 --> 00:27:21.832
it led also to all too meteoric a fall.

678
00:27:21.832 --> 00:27:24.039
It dissipated so quickly, it was so ephemeral.

679
00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.778
Oh, ephemeral, excuse me.

680
00:27:25.778 --> 00:27:27.133
Almost like a dream in the night.

681
00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:28.637
Kind of like the French Empire.

682
00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:31.655
That, that was almost an inevitable product

683
00:27:31.655 --> 00:27:33.192
of this kind of unnatural pact

684
00:27:33.192 --> 00:27:35.558
from that of the Hellfire Club,

685
00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:37.137
and the Americans inherited that.

686
00:27:37.137 --> 00:27:38.897
So that's what Aquino was explaining to me.

687
00:27:38.897 --> 00:27:42.524
Just as the Romans had stolen the divinities of the Greeks,

688
00:27:42.524 --> 00:27:44.498
the American empire has stolen the demons

689
00:27:44.498 --> 00:27:45.681
of the British Empire.

690
00:27:45.681 --> 00:27:48.188
<v Regina>Now let's explain your relationship to Aquino.</v>

691
00:27:48.188 --> 00:27:49.052
<v ->Mhmm.</v>

692
00:27:49.052 --> 00:27:50.769
<v Regina>How, how were you in contact with him?</v>

693
00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:53.969
<v ->Well, as a librarian's aide, and then ultimately</v>

694
00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:55.291
a military reference technician,

695
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:57.733
I was assigned to liaison with Colonel Aquino

696
00:27:57.733 --> 00:28:00.358
because Colonel Aquino desperately needed

697
00:28:00.358 --> 00:28:05.179
the library's services to acquire grimoires, and--

698
00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:06.618
Elder texts

699
00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:09.136
of forbidden magicks.

700
00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:11.472
And I say, "magicks" with a K,

701
00:28:11.472 --> 00:28:13.359
as in the traditional, actual magicks.

702
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:14.960
Not just leger de main.

703
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.656
<v Regina>And these were held within the library</v>

704
00:28:16.656 --> 00:28:17.540
at the Presidio?

705
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.543
<v ->No, these were at museums across the country.</v>

706
00:28:20.543 --> 00:28:22.441
<v Regina>Okay, all right.</v>
<v ->Or within the Commonwealth.</v>

707
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:24.947
And the, of the former British Empire.

708
00:28:24.947 --> 00:28:29.779
And they were in museums of universities.

709
00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:31.059
<v Regina>So you were sent?</v>

710
00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:34.077
<v ->No, what I worked with was O.C.L.C.,</v>

711
00:28:34.077 --> 00:28:37.651
the Online Cataloging and Library Cooperation Program.

712
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:38.376
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

713
00:28:38.376 --> 00:28:39.795
<v ->And through that, I used the</v>

714
00:28:39.795 --> 00:28:42.856
inter-library loan and exchange program

715
00:28:42.856 --> 00:28:44.594
to get these grimoires, which were--

716
00:28:44.594 --> 00:28:45.298
<v Regina>You mean, you could</v>

717
00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:46.664
check these books (laughs) out?

718
00:28:46.664 --> 00:28:47.667
(mumbles and laughs)

719
00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.760
<v ->I need to put, yeah, I need to put this into perspective.</v>

720
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.348
These books, of course, were in refrigerated safes.

721
00:28:52.348 --> 00:28:57.348
And no one could even access them within academia

722
00:28:57.873 --> 00:28:59.847
of these universities, unless they were studying

723
00:28:59.847 --> 00:29:01.874
that particular subject and had clearance.

724
00:29:01.874 --> 00:29:05.817
But what happened was, using his security clearances,

725
00:29:05.817 --> 00:29:09.031
what he invoked was that this was a national security issue.

726
00:29:09.031 --> 00:29:12.775
So, Colonel Aquino said, "We need these grimoires

727
00:29:12.775 --> 00:29:15.751
"in the sense that John Dee needed grimoires

728
00:29:15.751 --> 00:29:17.181
"to service his Queen."

729
00:29:17.181 --> 00:29:19.718
He said, "We need these for the U.S. Government.

730
00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:21.948
"These are a national security issue.

731
00:29:21.948 --> 00:29:23.803
"I need to analyze these documents,

732
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:28.699
"and therefore I invoke national security to make a claim

733
00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:31.483
"for library loan of these documents so I may use them."

734
00:29:31.483 --> 00:29:32.784
<v Regina>Explain what a grimoire is.</v>

735
00:29:32.784 --> 00:29:36.389
<v ->A grimoire is a occult text,</v>

736
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:41.389
a manuscript of spells, of various forms of occult ritual

737
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.095
that have been put into,

738
00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:48.666
put into writing, because most of these were

739
00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:50.640
in the days before print,

740
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.356
these are hand-written texts.

741
00:29:52.356 --> 00:29:56.239
And so, therefore infinitely valuable, they're priceless.

742
00:29:56.239 --> 00:29:58.905
It was only through the claim of national security

743
00:29:58.905 --> 00:30:00.794
that he would have the right to even look at them.

744
00:30:00.794 --> 00:30:02.596
They're, by handling them,

745
00:30:02.596 --> 00:30:04.206
you're endangering the manuscript.

746
00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:07.502
So, in other words, the integrity of the pages themselves.

747
00:30:07.502 --> 00:30:08.313
<v Regina>Right.</v>

748
00:30:08.313 --> 00:30:12.334
<v ->And so they would never allow people to look at them</v>

749
00:30:12.334 --> 00:30:14.328
without incredible justification,

750
00:30:14.328 --> 00:30:16.899
which he was able to pull, using his security clearances.

751
00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:18.317
<v Regina>So, how were these transported, then?</v>

752
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:20.963
<v ->These were transported by courier, as they would transport</v>

753
00:30:20.963 --> 00:30:22.520
any priceless antique.

754
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.034
<v Regina>Okay, so the courier came to you.</v>

755
00:30:24.034 --> 00:30:24.888
<v ->That's correct.</v>

756
00:30:24.888 --> 00:30:26.658
So the courier would bring them to the Presidio

757
00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.355
military base library,

758
00:30:28.355 --> 00:30:30.999
but the reason the rituals were performed within the library

759
00:30:30.999 --> 00:30:34.136
was because perforce, they could not leave the library.

760
00:30:34.136 --> 00:30:35.778
<v Regina>The books could not leave the library.</v>

761
00:30:35.778 --> 00:30:36.961
<v ->That is correct.
<v Regina>So, yeah.</v>

762
00:30:36.961 --> 00:30:41.961
<v ->And so Colonel Aquino had to perform the rituals there,</v>

763
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:44.651
which was how I was able to witness so many of them.

764
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:46.085
And...

765
00:30:46.507 --> 00:30:47.947
<v Regina>And, can you go into that?</v>

766
00:30:47.947 --> 00:30:49.174
What exactly was done?

767
00:30:49.174 --> 00:30:50.219
Who participated?

768
00:30:50.219 --> 00:30:52.076
And in the name of what?

769
00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:57.816
<v ->Well, Colonel Aquino had expanded his Temple of Set,</v>

770
00:30:58.115 --> 00:31:01.522
so that he had incorporated many high-level officers.

771
00:31:01.522 --> 00:31:04.792
Many high-level officers were attracted to his elitism,

772
00:31:04.792 --> 00:31:07.854
and the hierarchical structure of the sorcerer.

773
00:31:07.854 --> 00:31:12.290
It was a further form of specialization and empowerment

774
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.944
that they were hungry for,

775
00:31:13.944 --> 00:31:18.125
and so he, I had never seen a single person

776
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:20.355
who was part of his coven,

777
00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:23.575
who came into the library who was below the rank of Major.

778
00:31:23.575 --> 00:31:25.644
These were high-powered Majors.

779
00:31:25.644 --> 00:31:28.156
Colonels, Generals, and even though he was

780
00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:30.992
of lower rank than they, he was the Chaplain.

781
00:31:30.992 --> 00:31:34.917
He was the specialist, so there were more than a few Generals

782
00:31:34.917 --> 00:31:37.562
who were willing to kowtow to his specialization,

783
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:40.303
and follow his lead and his commands

784
00:31:40.303 --> 00:31:42.575
through the invocation of ritual.

785
00:31:42.575 --> 00:31:45.455
And the important thing is that they had to concentrate

786
00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:47.035
on following him completely,

787
00:31:47.035 --> 00:31:49.796
because the most dangerous thing in ritual

788
00:31:49.796 --> 00:31:53.401
is the breaking or severance of gnosis.

789
00:31:53.401 --> 00:31:57.807
When you enter a state of gnosis, or intimate communion

790
00:31:57.807 --> 00:31:59.364
with the entity you have summoned--

791
00:31:59.364 --> 00:32:03.609
Say, the sudden distraction of incoming gunfire,

792
00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:05.102
people are breaking into the room.

793
00:32:05.102 --> 00:32:08.559
If that breaks you out of gnosis (claps), the entity breaks.

794
00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:09.507
(claps)

795
00:32:09.507 --> 00:32:11.811
And the entity breaks in such a way that he's uncontrollable.

796
00:32:11.811 --> 00:32:13.901
And at that point, you've unbound something

797
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:16.056
(claps) which you can never put back in the box.

798
00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:18.306
It's like nuclear power, with a meltdown.

799
00:32:18.306 --> 00:32:20.066
Very similar to that.

800
00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:22.807
And as I described in the presentation,

801
00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:25.452
we were dealing with some of that meltdown

802
00:32:25.452 --> 00:32:28.898
when some of these asinine officers were doing the ritual

803
00:32:28.898 --> 00:32:32.396
without Colonel Aquino's supervision.

804
00:32:32.396 --> 00:32:33.836
Different types of ritual.

805
00:32:33.836 --> 00:32:36.513
So, but in the case of what I saw,

806
00:32:36.513 --> 00:32:41.513
some of the rituals that were invoked were rituals of the

807
00:32:42.913 --> 00:32:45.398
assault against an enemy,

808
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:48.139
where a wax hand was utilized to represent

809
00:32:48.139 --> 00:32:49.792
the hand that offended thee.

810
00:32:49.792 --> 00:32:53.578
And that was placed in the middle of the protective circle

811
00:32:53.578 --> 00:32:58.578
and what they invoked was a kind of entity of nullification,

812
00:32:58.984 --> 00:32:59.828
or death.

813
00:32:59.828 --> 00:33:01.332
A kind of entropic agent

814
00:33:01.332 --> 00:33:04.349
that had many names in ancient languages,

815
00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.738
that would be almost useless to pronounce.

816
00:33:06.738 --> 00:33:08.253
You saw some of the

817
00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:12.008
angelic, as they would call it, text or script,

818
00:33:12.008 --> 00:33:13.245
that I was showing last night.

819
00:33:13.245 --> 00:33:14.686
Now, it's an interesting term.

820
00:33:14.686 --> 00:33:16.637
We have to remember that even though they're summoning

821
00:33:16.637 --> 00:33:19.911
demonic entities, the entities would speak with

822
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:22.972
what was known as angelic script, or angelic text.

823
00:33:22.972 --> 00:33:24.967
You could invoke them because these are essentially

824
00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:27.729
fallen angels, or how they were interpreted as.

825
00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:29.468
<v Regina>A Luciferian type of, yes.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

826
00:33:29.468 --> 00:33:32.721
A Luciferian, a Luciferan paradigm.

827
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:37.179
And so by using Enochian script,

828
00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:41.521
or various other kinds of ancient scripts or symbols,

829
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:43.910
you could appeal to them in a language

830
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.564
that they had once used.

831
00:33:45.564 --> 00:33:48.442
And, but one of the things that I saw,

832
00:33:48.442 --> 00:33:51.066
as I described last night, was while I was working with

833
00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:52.602
the ovens, as I said, I meant--

834
00:33:52.602 --> 00:33:54.223
<v Regina>Explain why you were working with the ovens.</v>

835
00:33:54.223 --> 00:33:56.198
<v ->Yes, my job was document destruction.</v>

836
00:33:56.198 --> 00:33:58.075
One of my primary responsibilities.

837
00:33:58.075 --> 00:34:03.023
And entailed in that purview was the destruction

838
00:34:03.023 --> 00:34:05.369
of thousands and thousands of documents

839
00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:07.385
that were never released to academia.

840
00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:09.198
Certainly never released to the press,

841
00:34:09.198 --> 00:34:12.474
and therefore, as Colonel Aquino would express it,

842
00:34:12.474 --> 00:34:16.441
I was doing Satan's work, whether I was a Satanist or not.

843
00:34:16.441 --> 00:34:19.064
I was doing The Devil's work, because what I was performing

844
00:34:19.064 --> 00:34:21.155
was a form of cultural genocide.

845
00:34:21.155 --> 00:34:24.429
Depriving future generations of knowledge of the past.

846
00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.565
And without firm foundations in the past,

847
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:30.009
no one could make sound decisions for the future.

848
00:34:30.009 --> 00:34:32.418
And therefore, they would always be easily duped

849
00:34:32.418 --> 00:34:34.157
by leaders such as he.

850
00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:35.160
<v Regina>How did you feel--</v>

851
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.995
Now, just, just as an aside,

852
00:34:36.995 --> 00:34:38.477
how did you feel about that?

853
00:34:38.477 --> 00:34:40.844
<v ->Oh, of course I felt...
<v Regina>Really.</v>

854
00:34:40.844 --> 00:34:45.026
<v ->Vindictive, and certainly my way of fighting back</v>

855
00:34:45.026 --> 00:34:46.977
was to take copious notes.

856
00:34:46.977 --> 00:34:48.322
One of the reasons I was--

857
00:34:48.322 --> 00:34:49.185
<v Regina>What you're doing now.</v>

858
00:34:49.185 --> 00:34:50.316
Is part of it.

859
00:34:50.316 --> 00:34:53.174
<v ->What, what I'm doing now is exposing what I took notes on</v>

860
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:55.052
for all those many years.
<v Regina>Yes, yes.</v>

861
00:34:55.052 --> 00:34:58.518
<v ->And so it was towards this end that I was ultimately...</v>

862
00:35:01.528 --> 00:35:03.461
paving the way for my own rebellion.

863
00:35:03.925 --> 00:35:07.786
And so by working with him, we have to remember however,

864
00:35:07.786 --> 00:35:10.943
that I have the deepest respect for him in the sense that

865
00:35:10.943 --> 00:35:14.420
as a warrior of the darkness, he was true to his cause.

866
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.645
If there were other men, he, in that sense,

867
00:35:18.645 --> 00:35:20.736
was as true to his cause,

868
00:35:20.736 --> 00:35:25.402
as any Christian crusader of the days of the middle ages.

869
00:35:25.738 --> 00:35:28.801
And as I said, when he dies and goes to Hell,

870
00:35:28.801 --> 00:35:30.655
he will sit by the side of his master.

871
00:35:30.655 --> 00:35:32.490
He'll not be tossed into the pits.

872
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.635
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And...</v>

873
00:35:33.635 --> 00:35:35.168
<v Regina>He was fully committed.</v>

874
00:35:35.168 --> 00:35:36.407
<v ->He is fully committed.</v>

875
00:35:36.407 --> 00:35:39.639
And so in that sense, he is to be respected.

876
00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:42.114
And there was much to be learned from him,

877
00:35:42.114 --> 00:35:43.351
in that sense.

878
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:46.412
But I was not one of the men who wanted to become

879
00:35:46.412 --> 00:35:48.012
part of his Temple of Set,

880
00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:49.782
part of his personality cult,

881
00:35:49.782 --> 00:35:52.086
and part of his empire.

882
00:35:52.086 --> 00:35:54.614
<v Regina>So now let's go back to what you were saying</v>

883
00:35:54.614 --> 00:35:56.384
you noticed, or what you witnessed,

884
00:35:56.384 --> 00:35:59.402
particularly when these idiots, as I think you said, idiots

885
00:35:59.402 --> 00:36:00.693
(laughs) or something like that.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

886
00:36:00.693 --> 00:36:01.631
Yes, yeah.

887
00:36:01.631 --> 00:36:02.975
<v Regina>Went about trying to evoke something</v>

888
00:36:02.975 --> 00:36:03.926
on their own.

889
00:36:03.926 --> 00:36:05.268
<v ->That's right.</v>

890
00:36:05.268 --> 00:36:07.551
Certainly, that was a night where,

891
00:36:07.551 --> 00:36:08.874
to put it into perspective,

892
00:36:08.874 --> 00:36:11.263
strangely enough, unlike the San Fran--

893
00:36:11.263 --> 00:36:12.426
<v Regina>And you had the ovens going,</v>

894
00:36:12.426 --> 00:36:13.471
'cause you were burning documents.

895
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.239
<v ->That's right.</v>

896
00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:17.475
And that's the way, that's the way Colonel Aquino liked it,

897
00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.378
because there was--

898
00:36:18.378 --> 00:36:20.319
While I was burning information,

899
00:36:20.319 --> 00:36:24.916
while I was burning wisdom for the ages, so to speak,

900
00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.959
he felt that not only was genocidal action taking place,

901
00:36:30.679 --> 00:36:33.335
but he felt that I was invoking the very atmosphere

902
00:36:33.335 --> 00:36:35.729
of the environment of Hell itself.

903
00:36:36.076 --> 00:36:37.708
And because the entire library became hot,

904
00:36:37.708 --> 00:36:39.745
these were huge incinerators, as I said,

905
00:36:39.745 --> 00:36:41.954
some individual who was working with

906
00:36:41.954 --> 00:36:43.692
the Department of Defense as a librarian,

907
00:36:43.692 --> 00:36:47.042
doing the same technical detail, the same duty,

908
00:36:47.042 --> 00:36:49.782
had been pig-faced drunk, fell into the incinerator,

909
00:36:49.782 --> 00:36:51.521
it was large enough for a man to fall into.

910
00:36:51.521 --> 00:36:52.779
We're talking about something large enough

911
00:36:52.779 --> 00:36:53.846
to put a cadaver in.

912
00:36:53.846 --> 00:36:54.678
<v Regina>Right.</v>

913
00:36:54.678 --> 00:36:58.305
<v ->And so this individual, of course, ultimately died.</v>

914
00:36:58.305 --> 00:37:00.160
Nobody worked with the incinerators for 10 years,

915
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.374
then when I became a librarian's aide, I got the scut job.

916
00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:05.493
And it was dirty work, degrading work.

917
00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:09.339
You get soot all over you like a chimney sweep.

918
00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:12.912
You're constantly, your flesh is peeling.

919
00:37:12.912 --> 00:37:14.373
Just from the heat.

920
00:37:14.373 --> 00:37:19.373
And, but on the night that they did a broken evocation.

921
00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:22.938
What had happened was that these 12 officers--

922
00:37:22.938 --> 00:37:24.911
There's always supposed to be 13

923
00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:27.930
inside of one of these rituals, as their magick

924
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.028
was structured.

925
00:37:29.028 --> 00:37:31.995
And again, I emphasize that magick is a technique.

926
00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:35.461
It is a technology for harnessing energies

927
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:39.566
in the same sense that you would use mechanistic technologies

928
00:37:39.566 --> 00:37:41.892
to harness physics, or physical forces.

929
00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:45.305
So what had happened was these men were

930
00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:47.811
trying to test out these new automatic silencers.

931
00:37:47.811 --> 00:37:49.668
A silencer is a disposable instrument.

932
00:37:49.668 --> 00:37:51.992
You fire it off at a city, pew!

933
00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:54.798
It's heard once, background noise dissipates it,

934
00:37:54.798 --> 00:37:55.886
nobody pays attention.

935
00:37:55.886 --> 00:37:58.628
When you're firing full auto, you would have to have

936
00:37:58.628 --> 00:38:01.229
a silencer that dissipates or decays at a slower level.

937
00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:03.736
So this was pretty cutting-edge technology.

938
00:38:03.736 --> 00:38:06.893
And they were using some old M-16s with wooden stocks,

939
00:38:06.893 --> 00:38:09.794
very rare in this day and age, to test it out.

940
00:38:09.794 --> 00:38:11.884
These were at armories in the Presidio military base,

941
00:38:11.884 --> 00:38:13.164
but there was no firing range.

942
00:38:13.164 --> 00:38:14.860
So they used the Presidio playground,

943
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.127
and they were hanging up these little CPR dummies

944
00:38:19.127 --> 00:38:21.271
that were like CPR children,

945
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:22.796
for people to practice child CPR.

946
00:38:22.796 --> 00:38:24.012
They couldn't use adult ones,

947
00:38:24.012 --> 00:38:25.814
because it was too heavy to lug around.

948
00:38:25.814 --> 00:38:27.489
So they used the children's ones to make

949
00:38:27.489 --> 00:38:28.727
harder targets as well.

950
00:38:28.727 --> 00:38:30.187
And they hung them up on the swings.

951
00:38:30.187 --> 00:38:32.320
So you had this very bizarre, morbid image

952
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.382
of these childlike effigies swinging on these nooses,

953
00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:38.315
from the swings already in the darkness.

954
00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:40.448
And they, since, they were doing it at night

955
00:38:40.448 --> 00:38:42.092
so nobody will see what they're doing.

956
00:38:42.092 --> 00:38:43.137
<v Regina>And these high ranking officers--</v>

957
00:38:43.137 --> 00:38:45.024
<v ->High ranking officers that'd probably been drinking.</v>

958
00:38:45.024 --> 00:38:48.687
And they said, "Well, we'll evoke the spirits so that we,

959
00:38:48.687 --> 00:38:51.033
"we'll put it in the weapons so that we can fire these

960
00:38:51.033 --> 00:38:52.411
"instruments in the dark.

961
00:38:52.411 --> 00:38:54.639
"Nobody's gonna hear the suppressed silencers,

962
00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:58.137
"nobody's gonna see us, and we'll practice this night firing

963
00:38:58.137 --> 00:38:59.716
"and see what we can do."

964
00:38:59.716 --> 00:39:03.162
So, they were doing this without night vision goggles.

965
00:39:03.162 --> 00:39:04.346
I need to emphasize this.

966
00:39:04.346 --> 00:39:07.129
And so, they were just gonna power the weapons,

967
00:39:07.129 --> 00:39:08.153
and it'd be safe.

968
00:39:08.153 --> 00:39:09.283
<v Regina>What was the distance?</v>

969
00:39:09.283 --> 00:39:11.726
<v ->The distance was enormous, it must have been...</v>

970
00:39:11.726 --> 00:39:13.699
You know, I'm so bad with this.

971
00:39:13.699 --> 00:39:17.134
It must been, my God, it must have been at least 100 yards.

972
00:39:17.134 --> 00:39:18.253
It's gotta be more than that.

973
00:39:18.253 --> 00:39:19.267
<v Regina>Like a football field?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

974
00:39:19.267 --> 00:39:20.313
It's gotta be like that.
<v Regina>Seriously.</v>

975
00:39:20.313 --> 00:39:21.592
No, no night goggles
<v ->About half a football field.</v>

976
00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:23.246
'Bout half, half a football field, yeah.
<v Regina>Half a football field,</v>

977
00:39:23.246 --> 00:39:24.312
no night goggles.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

978
00:39:24.312 --> 00:39:25.699
<v Regina>Trying to shoot at something</v>

979
00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:26.606
the size of a child.

980
00:39:26.606 --> 00:39:28.302
<v ->Yeah, in the dark, swinging from a bench.</v>

981
00:39:28.302 --> 00:39:29.485
Ah, swinging from a swing.

982
00:39:29.485 --> 00:39:31.180
And so--

983
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.407
<v Regina>Challenging mark.</v>

984
00:39:32.407 --> 00:39:34.296
<v ->Challenging mark, physically impossible</v>

985
00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:36.503
under any normal circumstances.

986
00:39:36.503 --> 00:39:38.957
If you're going full auto, you might catch something by luck

987
00:39:38.957 --> 00:39:40.929
with a burst, you know, just swinging it.

988
00:39:40.929 --> 00:39:42.210
But they weren't aiming for that.

989
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.044
They were empowering the instruments, is what their

990
00:39:44.044 --> 00:39:45.186
intention was, so they were drew,

991
00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:46.369
took the wooden stocks,

992
00:39:46.369 --> 00:39:49.963
and they carved these pentagrams in the stocks,

993
00:39:49.963 --> 00:39:53.355
and then they took the pentagram on the ground,

994
00:39:53.355 --> 00:39:57.259
and basically they took some of their blood,

995
00:39:57.259 --> 00:40:00.203
and put it, to blood the pentagram.

996
00:40:00.203 --> 00:40:02.688
They summoned the entity, and while I was

997
00:40:02.688 --> 00:40:05.546
working with the ovens, suddenly--

998
00:40:05.546 --> 00:40:06.890
I knew what they were doing.

999
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.097
I was aware of what they were gonna do,

1000
00:40:08.097 --> 00:40:10.165
because I had to basically, they were filing everything

1001
00:40:10.165 --> 00:40:11.254
through the library.

1002
00:40:11.254 --> 00:40:13.738
Not in terms of putting it in books or accounting for it,

1003
00:40:13.738 --> 00:40:15.850
but they were just assembling everything

1004
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.940
and doing the pentagram carving on the wooden stocks

1005
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.943
in the library,

1006
00:40:18.943 --> 00:40:19.914
so I knew what they were doing.

1007
00:40:19.914 --> 00:40:22.261
I saw the, the flash suppressors and the silencers,

1008
00:40:22.261 --> 00:40:22.985
all the rest of that.

1009
00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:24.032
I knew what was going on.

1010
00:40:24.032 --> 00:40:25.546
So I was aware of their intent.

1011
00:40:25.546 --> 00:40:28.212
And I knew something was just, potentially wrong,

1012
00:40:28.212 --> 00:40:29.706
because Aquino wasn't there.

1013
00:40:29.706 --> 00:40:33.971
And so when they did what they did out in the playground,

1014
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:35.039
and they're firin' away,

1015
00:40:35.039 --> 00:40:36.894
while I'm working with the oven,

1016
00:40:36.894 --> 00:40:39.006
suddenly, everything went cold.

1017
00:40:39.006 --> 00:40:42.120
I mean, not only the chill in the air,

1018
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.285
not only the fact that you suddenly felt like you'd

1019
00:40:44.285 --> 00:40:45.768
been locked in a refrigerator.

1020
00:40:45.768 --> 00:40:48.253
And it was cold enough, physically, where you felt like

1021
00:40:48.253 --> 00:40:50.205
you'd slammed your fingers in a door.

1022
00:40:50.205 --> 00:40:51.943
Everything going numb to that point.

1023
00:40:51.943 --> 00:40:54.012
Like, you step outside during a sub-zero winter,

1024
00:40:54.012 --> 00:40:57.425
and just everything suddenly just going

1025
00:40:57.425 --> 00:40:59.073
bone-numbingly cold--
<v Regina>And you were still near the fire.</v>

1026
00:40:59.073 --> 00:41:00.104
<v ->And I'm right near the incinerator.
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

1027
00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:02.507
<v ->I'm, I'm right near the incinerator,</v>

1028
00:41:02.507 --> 00:41:05.120
it's going at full blast, and I realize I'm feeling no heat,

1029
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.976
I'm putting my hand almost into the fire.

1030
00:41:06.976 --> 00:41:09.046
Almost to the point where I stop myself because

1031
00:41:09.046 --> 00:41:10.603
I've realized I'm gonna injure myself.

1032
00:41:10.603 --> 00:41:12.682
And then I said, "But I'm not feeling anything."

1033
00:41:12.682 --> 00:41:15.126
But worse than that, it was the numbness on the inside.

1034
00:41:15.126 --> 00:41:16.982
Everything was gone.

1035
00:41:16.982 --> 00:41:20.447
Any feeling I had towards love, or any feeling--

1036
00:41:20.447 --> 00:41:22.762
Like, love towards my parents, my mother and father.

1037
00:41:22.762 --> 00:41:24.756
All of that was gone.

1038
00:41:24.756 --> 00:41:27.892
Any kind of empathy that one had, like you feel

1039
00:41:27.892 --> 00:41:29.748
when you're petting or stroking an animal.

1040
00:41:29.748 --> 00:41:32.766
That kind of like, automatic biological empathy.

1041
00:41:32.766 --> 00:41:35.209
That kind of intercourse of life

1042
00:41:35.209 --> 00:41:37.043
that goes on between us.

1043
00:41:37.043 --> 00:41:41.481
Just as a natural effect, was just all gone.

1044
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:43.870
All that empathy was gone, I wasn't feeling anything.

1045
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:48.680
And I knew something had gone terribly, cosmically wrong.

1046
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.114
And when I walked outside towards the playground,

1047
00:41:52.114 --> 00:41:54.920
as I'm walkin' towards them, I noticed that

1048
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.402
there's something wrong in the environment,

1049
00:41:56.402 --> 00:41:59.218
because they're firing at full auto with the silencers,

1050
00:41:59.218 --> 00:42:00.519
and I'm hearin' it.

1051
00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:02.023
Like, "Chu, chu, chu, chu, chu, chu,

1052
00:42:02.023 --> 00:42:02.866
"chu, chu, chu, chu, chu."

1053
00:42:02.866 --> 00:42:03.772
It's chortling away.

1054
00:42:03.772 --> 00:42:04.839
And I'm saying, "I shouldn't be hearing this."

1055
00:42:04.839 --> 00:42:07.836
Because normally, ambient background noise

1056
00:42:07.836 --> 00:42:09.223
would be blockin' it out.

1057
00:42:09.223 --> 00:42:11.292
Even in the jungle, whether you're in the forest,

1058
00:42:11.292 --> 00:42:12.476
whether you're in the city,

1059
00:42:12.476 --> 00:42:13.916
there's ambient background noise,

1060
00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:17.766
either from the violence of animals fighting each other

1061
00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:20.806
for food in the local hedgerow, whether it's like

1062
00:42:20.806 --> 00:42:21.553
the crickets chirp--

1063
00:42:21.553 --> 00:42:22.834
There was nothing, none of that was going on.

1064
00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:25.734
There was no crickets, there was no, there was no animals,

1065
00:42:25.734 --> 00:42:26.843
there was no rustling--
<v Regina>Like life had ceased.</v>

1066
00:42:26.843 --> 00:42:28.336
<v ->Everything had ceased in that area,</v>

1067
00:42:28.336 --> 00:42:29.894
in terms of making any noise,

1068
00:42:29.894 --> 00:42:32.208
and I'm hearing that chortling so pronouncedly.

1069
00:42:32.208 --> 00:42:33.136
(snapping)

1070
00:42:33.136 --> 00:42:33.979
Said, "The noise has stopped."

1071
00:42:33.979 --> 00:42:35.482
And I walked up to them, and I said,

1072
00:42:35.482 --> 00:42:36.880
"Something's happened."

1073
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.344
And they turned around, and all of their eyes were glowing.

1074
00:42:39.344 --> 00:42:40.791
<v Regina>Oh, jeez.</v>
<v ->Just 12 of these adult men</v>

1075
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:43.823
in full uniform, they've got the bandages on their hand

1076
00:42:43.823 --> 00:42:45.380
where they'd performed the blood ritual.

1077
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.522
Like I said, they must've been drunk.

1078
00:42:46.522 --> 00:42:48.730
There was a lot of blood in the pentagram.

1079
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:49.444
<v Regina>More than a prick.</v>

1080
00:42:49.444 --> 00:42:51.044
<v ->Yeah, more than a prick, like a cut.</v>

1081
00:42:51.044 --> 00:42:53.092
Like they'd done with a boxcutter that they were using.

1082
00:42:53.092 --> 00:42:57.220
And so I went to look at the pentagram, and I said,

1083
00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.153
"You effed up, 'cause the circle wasn't closed."

1084
00:43:00.153 --> 00:43:00.922
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

1085
00:43:00.922 --> 00:43:03.982
<v ->And, that's when of course, I turned around,</v>

1086
00:43:03.982 --> 00:43:06.330
because I heard them just all cocking their rifles.

1087
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.860
And I knew that their first immediate thought was,

1088
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.971
well if they kill me, they can blood it enough

1089
00:43:11.971 --> 00:43:14.285
that it'll satiate the entity and it'll go back.

1090
00:43:14.285 --> 00:43:15.171
And of course--

1091
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:16.568
<v Regina>Make, use you as a sacrifice.</v>

1092
00:43:16.568 --> 00:43:17.400
<v ->That's right.</v>

1093
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.978
And of course, I wasn't scared,

1094
00:43:18.978 --> 00:43:20.461
because I wasn't feeling anything.

1095
00:43:20.461 --> 00:43:24.622
But, so the first thing I said was, "Why am I feeling this?"

1096
00:43:25.632 --> 00:43:27.887
And I realized it immediately, before they even spoke,

1097
00:43:27.887 --> 00:43:30.117
"Well we put your name in the context,"

1098
00:43:30.117 --> 00:43:31.461
because they needed 13.

1099
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:34.318
So whatever ritual they'd invoked--
<v Regina>Oh, they'd pull you in.</v>

1100
00:43:34.318 --> 00:43:36.100
<v ->If Aquino wasn't there, they'd put my name</v>

1101
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.052
in the context of the evocation.

1102
00:43:38.052 --> 00:43:38.937
So I was includ--

1103
00:43:38.937 --> 00:43:41.380
And normally, of course, that would be so outrageous,

1104
00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.766
so invasive, so,

1105
00:43:42.766 --> 00:43:46.968
such a violating act, anyone would feel so much outrage,

1106
00:43:46.968 --> 00:43:48.899
so much violation at that.

1107
00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:50.691
But of course, I wasn't feeling anything.

1108
00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:51.523
(laughs)

1109
00:43:51.523 --> 00:43:52.568
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah, you felt nothing.</v>

1110
00:43:52.568 --> 00:43:55.097
<v ->And, and that was also one of the reasons</v>

1111
00:43:55.097 --> 00:43:57.026
I wasn't frightened, I'm not feeling anything.

1112
00:43:57.026 --> 00:43:59.906
And of course, knowing what they were intending, I said,

1113
00:43:59.906 --> 00:44:04.269
"Your careers will be seriously impacted by my murder."

1114
00:44:04.269 --> 00:44:06.167
And that was what stopped them.

1115
00:44:06.167 --> 00:44:07.522
Then they put their guns down,

1116
00:44:07.522 --> 00:44:10.701
and they're saying, you know, "There's nothin' wrong."

1117
00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:12.375
You know, "It's gone into the weapons."

1118
00:44:12.375 --> 00:44:13.953
I said, "It's not the weapons, it's you.

1119
00:44:13.953 --> 00:44:15.596
"Your eyes are glowing.

1120
00:44:15.596 --> 00:44:16.854
"The entity's inside you,

1121
00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.268
"that's why you're hittin' your mark."

1122
00:44:18.268 --> 00:44:19.617
You know, because they had,

1123
00:44:19.617 --> 00:44:21.079
they had done the physically impossible.

1124
00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:23.073
Without night vision, they were hitting their mark.

1125
00:44:23.073 --> 00:44:26.380
Those, those little CPR dummies of children were swinging,

1126
00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.864
just in tatters, you know, on the swing.

1127
00:44:28.864 --> 00:44:32.460
Just this ghostly image of these shattered children,

1128
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.877
swinging on the swing.

1129
00:44:33.877 --> 00:44:35.733
And I said, "We've gotta go back in.

1130
00:44:35.733 --> 00:44:37.013
"We've got to fix this."

1131
00:44:37.013 --> 00:44:39.957
And they were like, "Well, you're,

1132
00:44:39.957 --> 00:44:41.749
"you're from Asia, you're Buddhist,

1133
00:44:41.749 --> 00:44:43.904
"why don't you call on Buddha or somethin' like that,

1134
00:44:43.904 --> 00:44:45.184
"send this thing away?"

1135
00:44:45.184 --> 00:44:46.583
And I'm like, saying, "You don't understand.

1136
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.579
"There's one of me, and there's 12 of you.

1137
00:44:48.579 --> 00:44:50.765
"We're gonna use your cultural context.

1138
00:44:50.765 --> 00:44:53.207
"We're gonna do this old school, we've gotta find a Bible."

1139
00:44:53.207 --> 00:44:54.647
And we went inside of the library,

1140
00:44:54.647 --> 00:44:56.034
and we're just tearin' the place apart,

1141
00:44:56.484 --> 00:44:57.628
and there was no Bible!

1142
00:44:58.245 --> 00:45:00.474
That was the first time I'd ever given it any thought

1143
00:45:00.474 --> 00:45:04.378
that we've got this major, central postal military library,

1144
00:45:04.378 --> 00:45:06.906
and it must have been denuded of anything holy.

1145
00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:09.669
Or anything deemed holy by anyth, any culture

1146
00:45:09.669 --> 00:45:12.272
during the decades that it's been in existence.

1147
00:45:12.272 --> 00:45:13.380
And I said, "Find anything!

1148
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.033
"Find The Book of Mormon, anything similar."

1149
00:45:15.033 --> 00:45:16.398
And we're tearing it apart for a Book of Mormon,

1150
00:45:16.398 --> 00:45:17.582
but we couldn't find anything.

1151
00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:20.793
There was nothing considered holy by any culture

1152
00:45:20.793 --> 00:45:23.022
that was in that library,

1153
00:45:23.022 --> 00:45:24.922
and we finally, I said, "The children's room.

1154
00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:25.784
"Go to the children's room."

1155
00:45:25.784 --> 00:45:27.481
And we went into the children's room and we dug up this,

1156
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:30.776
this tiny little child's Bible that had little pictures

1157
00:45:30.776 --> 00:45:33.379
of Jesus smiling like it was out of a toothpaste commercial.

1158
00:45:33.379 --> 00:45:34.884
I said, "This'll have to do."

1159
00:45:34.884 --> 00:45:36.128
And then I put it on the table and I said,

1160
00:45:36.128 --> 00:45:37.019
"Get on your knees."

1161
00:45:37.019 --> 00:45:38.022
And they, and my father--

1162
00:45:38.022 --> 00:45:40.549
I had never been baptized, but my father was a Catholic.

1163
00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:42.379
He's Caucasian, half German, half Irish.

1164
00:45:42.379 --> 00:45:43.755
My mother, of course, is Asian.

1165
00:45:43.755 --> 00:45:45.750
But I said, "We'll do the Lord's Prayer."

1166
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.912
And that's the only thing I could think of,

1167
00:45:46.912 --> 00:45:48.064
was the Catholic Lord's Prayer.

1168
00:45:48.064 --> 00:45:49.973
And we started that, "Our father who art in Heaven,

1169
00:45:49.973 --> 00:45:50.977
"hallowed be thy name."

1170
00:45:50.977 --> 00:45:52.459
You know, just all the rest of that.

1171
00:45:52.459 --> 00:45:54.635
We just, and, and you couldn't get it out.

1172
00:45:54.635 --> 00:45:55.968
You couldn't get it out at all.

1173
00:45:55.968 --> 00:45:57.515
It was like there was a gag, a ball--

1174
00:45:57.515 --> 00:45:58.816
<v Regina>Like it was stuck in your throat.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

1175
00:45:58.816 --> 00:46:00.426
It was just, and

1176
00:46:00.426 --> 00:46:01.397
we were just choking.

1177
00:46:01.397 --> 00:46:04.394
And I said, "Get the pentagrams off the rifle butts."

1178
00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:07.594
And we, we started carving that off, scraping that off.

1179
00:46:07.594 --> 00:46:09.012
I said, "Put crosses on there."

1180
00:46:09.012 --> 00:46:10.847
And they're just, like, scraping it off.

1181
00:46:10.847 --> 00:46:12.799
And it's like something was physically preventing us.

1182
00:46:12.799 --> 00:46:14.697
We couldn't even get this done.

1183
00:46:14.697 --> 00:46:16.692
It just, it felt like it was taking forever.

1184
00:46:16.692 --> 00:46:19.252
And then we're finally like, trying to carve these crosses.

1185
00:46:19.252 --> 00:46:22.623
It took all of our muscular energy to do

1186
00:46:22.623 --> 00:46:24.318
what had seemed, for them, so simple

1187
00:46:24.318 --> 00:46:25.663
when they were coming in.

1188
00:46:25.663 --> 00:46:28.328
And then we finally got these crosses affixed to the,

1189
00:46:28.328 --> 00:46:29.790
all of these 12 rifle butts.

1190
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.678
And then we put these guns down, and I said,

1191
00:46:31.678 --> 00:46:32.808
"Start the Lord's Prayer again."

1192
00:46:32.808 --> 00:46:34.461
And we're doing this, and we're just barely

1193
00:46:34.461 --> 00:46:35.529
able to get it out.

1194
00:46:35.529 --> 00:46:36.297
We're just choke--

1195
00:46:36.297 --> 00:46:38.130
Literally, choking on the words.

1196
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.626
And just like there's a ball gag in our mouths,

1197
00:46:40.626 --> 00:46:42.802
we're feeling dry, this vinegary taste,

1198
00:46:42.802 --> 00:46:45.363
and, and we're finally, we're gettin' this out anyway.

1199
00:46:45.363 --> 00:46:47.197
And it becomes easier, progressively easier

1200
00:46:47.197 --> 00:46:48.306
and easier and easier,

1201
00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:49.899
and I'm just going, "God forgive us,

1202
00:46:49.899 --> 00:46:50.923
"we're your lost children,

1203
00:46:50.923 --> 00:46:52.501
"we are lost, we did a, made a mistake,

1204
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:53.919
"we we we will never do it again.

1205
00:46:53.919 --> 00:46:54.943
"Please, dear God, please."

1206
00:46:54.943 --> 00:46:57.151
You know, we're just going through this desperate motion,

1207
00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:58.297
this infantile...

1208
00:46:58.815 --> 00:46:59.519
<v Regina>Begging.</v>

1209
00:46:59.519 --> 00:47:00.372
<v ->Yeah, begging.</v>

1210
00:47:00.372 --> 00:47:04.969
And then finally, it dissipates, and something rips.

1211
00:47:04.969 --> 00:47:07.477
Something rips from the inner core, the inner essence

1212
00:47:07.477 --> 00:47:08.436
of our beings.

1213
00:47:08.436 --> 00:47:09.524
Certainly from mine.

1214
00:47:09.524 --> 00:47:12.190
And whatever it was that was in there was so rooted

1215
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.355
with, like a cancer, like a carcinoma,

1216
00:47:14.355 --> 00:47:18.302
that whatever was excised, it took something else with it.

1217
00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:21.384
Like, like removing a bit of whatever organ or tissue

1218
00:47:21.384 --> 00:47:25.107
that you have to when you're excising a carcinoma.

1219
00:47:25.107 --> 00:47:26.291
Or a tumor.

1220
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:28.489
And I don't know what's missing now,

1221
00:47:28.489 --> 00:47:30.738
but I know something is missing from me.

1222
00:47:30.738 --> 00:47:32.765
I'll never be able to recall what it is,

1223
00:47:32.765 --> 00:47:35.527
but I think it's a happy memory.

1224
00:47:35.527 --> 00:47:36.338
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

1225
00:47:36.338 --> 00:47:38.450
<v ->Something was taken that I feel, in essence,</v>

1226
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:39.292
was a happy memory.

1227
00:47:39.292 --> 00:47:40.636
<v Regina>Something that was important and loving</v>

1228
00:47:40.636 --> 00:47:42.396
and beautiful to you, yeah.
<v ->Something important, something, yes.</v>

1229
00:47:42.396 --> 00:47:43.752
Went missing with that.

1230
00:47:43.752 --> 00:47:45.942
But the...

1231
00:47:47.132 --> 00:47:48.573
The malignancy was gone.

1232
00:47:48.573 --> 00:47:50.503
The malignancy was gone, and we just all collapsed

1233
00:47:50.503 --> 00:47:52.892
onto the floor, and some of them just started vomiting.

1234
00:47:52.892 --> 00:47:55.025
Some of these officers just started, bleh.

1235
00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:56.422
Just instantly vomiting.

1236
00:47:56.422 --> 00:47:57.255
I'm so sorry.

1237
00:47:57.255 --> 00:47:58.374
<v Regina>That's, that's (laughs)</v>

1238
00:47:58.374 --> 00:48:01.831
<v ->The, and I of course, was just, just totally drained,</v>

1239
00:48:01.831 --> 00:48:02.663
totally exhausted.

1240
00:48:02.663 --> 00:48:03.612
We're all sweating.

1241
00:48:03.612 --> 00:48:04.967
We're just all pale, diaphoretic.

1242
00:48:04.967 --> 00:48:07.057
We're just, and we just lay there for what must've been

1243
00:48:07.057 --> 00:48:08.956
a good half an hour to 45 minutes,

1244
00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:10.630
just trembling, just innervated.

1245
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.305
Just trembling, just literally trembling.

1246
00:48:12.305 --> 00:48:17.305
And then finally, I said, "Okay, get those damn rifles"

1247
00:48:17.318 --> 00:48:18.779
(laughs) "back into the armory.

1248
00:48:18.779 --> 00:48:21.797
"Get those children's CPR dummies off of that bench,

1249
00:48:21.797 --> 00:48:23.099
"and get out of here."

1250
00:48:23.099 --> 00:48:25.531
And of course, they went and did, they did just that.

1251
00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:29.040
And, but we left the pentagram with the blood on the ground.

1252
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.922
As I said, tragically, just morosely, just malevolently,

1253
00:48:32.922 --> 00:48:35.589
symbols and blooded pentagrams were so common

1254
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:37.658
throughout the Presidio military base, you could do that.

1255
00:48:37.658 --> 00:48:39.460
You could just leave that crap on the ground,

1256
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.975
and the children would come and play on the playground

1257
00:48:40.975 --> 00:48:42.180
the very next day.
<v Regina>And no one noticed.</v>

1258
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.855
<v ->And they've seen so much of that, that no one even took it--</v>

1259
00:48:43.855 --> 00:48:45.412
Everybody just took that for granted.

1260
00:48:45.412 --> 00:48:46.639
<v Regina>So let's get to the children now.</v>

1261
00:48:46.639 --> 00:48:49.796
Because, as ill-advised and absolutely horrific

1262
00:48:49.796 --> 00:48:51.257
as that experience was,

1263
00:48:51.257 --> 00:48:54.745
it made what was going on there very real for you, obviously.

1264
00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:55.534
<v ->Yes.</v>

1265
00:48:55.534 --> 00:48:56.601
<v Regina>You started to understand</v>

1266
00:48:56.601 --> 00:48:57.572
the forces that were at work.

1267
00:48:57.572 --> 00:48:59.363
And now, let's talk about what happened

1268
00:48:59.363 --> 00:49:00.803
with the children there.

1269
00:49:00.803 --> 00:49:02.149
<v ->Okay.
<v Regina>And let's go on to what happened</v>

1270
00:49:02.149 --> 00:49:03.770
with the children at West Point.

1271
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.231
<v ->Yes, yeah.</v>

1272
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:08.272
The child daycare center at the Presidio military base

1273
00:49:08.272 --> 00:49:11.172
could house, at maximum, about a quarter

1274
00:49:11.172 --> 00:49:13.455
of a thousand children, about 250 children.

1275
00:49:13.455 --> 00:49:15.962
That's a lotta kids, if you've (laughs) ever dealt with kids.

1276
00:49:15.962 --> 00:49:17.514
And...

1277
00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.886
But over a period of several years,

1278
00:49:19.886 --> 00:49:22.254
it dwindled down to 180 children in attendance,

1279
00:49:22.254 --> 00:49:24.547
because they became so traumatized by the events,

1280
00:49:24.547 --> 00:49:27.054
that they refused to return, their parents refused

1281
00:49:27.054 --> 00:49:29.753
to bring them back, something horrible was going on

1282
00:49:29.753 --> 00:49:31.577
within the child daycare center.

1283
00:49:31.577 --> 00:49:33.198
What was going on there, that was so horrible,

1284
00:49:33.198 --> 00:49:34.893
was Gary Willard Hambright.

1285
00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:37.123
Gary Willard Hambright was my high school teacher.

1286
00:49:37.123 --> 00:49:39.021
Went to a vocational institute,

1287
00:49:39.021 --> 00:49:40.792
John O'Connell Vocational Institute,

1288
00:49:40.792 --> 00:49:42.178
in San Francisco.

1289
00:49:42.178 --> 00:49:44.322
They since tore it down, as a matter of fact.

1290
00:49:44.322 --> 00:49:46.519
The John O'Connell that exists in San Francisco today

1291
00:49:46.519 --> 00:49:48.846
is a totally reconstructed, reorganized entity,

1292
00:49:48.846 --> 00:49:50.754
having nothing to do with the John O'Connell

1293
00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:53.143
that I attended, which used to be in the Mission district,

1294
00:49:53.143 --> 00:49:54.648
in the Barrio of San Francisco.

1295
00:49:54.648 --> 00:49:56.600
What used to be a heavy Irish neighborhood,

1296
00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.408
which was why it was a working class vocational institute.

1297
00:50:00.408 --> 00:50:02.145
But everyone pretty much knew it as

1298
00:50:02.145 --> 00:50:03.286
San Quentin Prep.

1299
00:50:03.286 --> 00:50:05.750
It was, it was a very bad school.

1300
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.115
Loaded with gang activity.

1301
00:50:07.115 --> 00:50:10.155
It was very similar because it was full of shops,

1302
00:50:10.155 --> 00:50:11.714
very similar to prison shops.

1303
00:50:12.664 --> 00:50:14.270
People were tattooing each other!

1304
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:15.379
In that school.

1305
00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:18.335
And so, to give you an idea of the environment--

1306
00:50:18.335 --> 00:50:19.486
<v Regina>Your early education (laughs)</v>

1307
00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.446
<v ->That's right.</v>

1308
00:50:20.446 --> 00:50:22.398
But my, one of my teachers, I majored in commercial

1309
00:50:22.398 --> 00:50:25.715
illustration, so when I majored in commercial illustration,

1310
00:50:25.715 --> 00:50:28.286
my high school teacher in this regard was

1311
00:50:28.286 --> 00:50:30.452
Gary Willard Hambright, who was a

1312
00:50:30.452 --> 00:50:33.170
ordained Southern Baptist Minister,

1313
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:35.656
it must be emphasized, without a pulpit.

1314
00:50:35.656 --> 00:50:38.493
So he was living in a church that was charitable enough

1315
00:50:38.493 --> 00:50:39.442
to give him a place to live.

1316
00:50:39.442 --> 00:50:40.818
So he was essentially homeless,

1317
00:50:40.818 --> 00:50:43.623
and he kept his child pornography at the school.

1318
00:50:43.623 --> 00:50:45.618
He obviously couldn't sequester it in the church facility.

1319
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:48.920
So he kept it at the school, and he got away with it

1320
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.615
because it's a commercial art course,

1321
00:50:50.615 --> 00:50:52.141
and illustration facility,

1322
00:50:52.141 --> 00:50:55.160
and so that shop would have all kinds of drawings

1323
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.973
of anything for art references.

1324
00:50:56.973 --> 00:50:59.063
So he said, "All these naked children are for bodily

1325
00:50:59.063 --> 00:51:00.364
"references, for drawing kids."

1326
00:51:00.364 --> 00:51:01.943
<v Regina>Now, what was he doing at the school?</v>

1327
00:51:01.943 --> 00:51:04.311
<v ->He was teaching commercial illustration, but--</v>

1328
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:06.838
<v Regina>Okay, this was at the O'Connell School?</v>

1329
00:51:06.838 --> 00:51:08.022
<v ->That's correct.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

1330
00:51:08.022 --> 00:51:09.677
<v ->That's correct, but then he wound up getting a job</v>

1331
00:51:09.677 --> 00:51:11.574
at the child daycare center.

1332
00:51:11.574 --> 00:51:13.035
He managed the child daycare center at the Presidio

1333
00:51:13.035 --> 00:51:14.338
military base.

1334
00:51:14.338 --> 00:51:17.658
And I, myself, remember some...

1335
00:51:18.967 --> 00:51:20.256
I was too old for him.

1336
00:51:20.256 --> 00:51:21.867
I was way too old for him, so I was never molested,

1337
00:51:21.867 --> 00:51:24.235
but I remember standing in the men's urinal once,

1338
00:51:24.235 --> 00:51:25.184
relieving myself.

1339
00:51:25.184 --> 00:51:27.648
He saunters in, you know, it's the manly thing to do,

1340
00:51:27.648 --> 00:51:30.646
like men do at baseball stadiums, relieving himself,

1341
00:51:30.646 --> 00:51:32.565
talkin' to me, "Hey'd you catch that new film,

1342
00:51:32.565 --> 00:51:33.567
"Quest for Fire?"

1343
00:51:33.567 --> 00:51:35.702
Don't know if you remember that comin' out in the 1980s,

1344
00:51:35.702 --> 00:51:37.931
about the cavemen, you know, discoverin' fire.

1345
00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:40.554
Yeah, I says, "No, I haven't seen that yet.

1346
00:51:40.554 --> 00:51:41.300
"What about it?"

1347
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.967
He says, "Yeah, I liked that scene where they discover sex.

1348
00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:46.016
"You know, they're not just, you know."

1349
00:51:46.016 --> 00:51:46.825
(laughter)

1350
00:51:46.825 --> 00:51:48.126
"Humpin' each other to produce kids,

1351
00:51:48.126 --> 00:51:49.909
"they're actually like, givin' each other pleasure."

1352
00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:50.750
And stuff like that.

1353
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:51.998
I'm like, sayin', "Oh that's interesting, I'll--"

1354
00:51:51.998 --> 00:51:53.854
Just demented conversation

1355
00:51:53.854 --> 00:51:54.761
(laughter)

1356
00:51:54.761 --> 00:51:56.158
standing next to somebody at a urinal.

1357
00:51:56.158 --> 00:51:58.964
And then, that was one of my early experiences with him,

1358
00:51:58.964 --> 00:52:02.312
in terms of a more like, off-color kind of remark.

1359
00:52:02.312 --> 00:52:05.193
<v Regina>Turns out he was much more seriously demented.</v>

1360
00:52:05.193 --> 00:52:07.304
<v ->Yeah, yes, he was much more, yeah.</v>

1361
00:52:07.304 --> 00:52:08.978
He was actually evil.

1362
00:52:08.978 --> 00:52:10.834
Not just, it wasn't just funny.

1363
00:52:10.834 --> 00:52:15.079
But, in terms of when we started hearing all of these

1364
00:52:15.079 --> 00:52:17.469
horrible incidents taking place,

1365
00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:19.101
the children started describing to me horrible things

1366
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:20.679
in the children's room at the library,

1367
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:21.490
what was happening to 'em.

1368
00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:24.508
None of the elder people took it seriously at the library.

1369
00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:25.106
They--

1370
00:52:25.106 --> 00:52:27.089
It was dismissed as childhood fantasies.

1371
00:52:27.089 --> 00:52:30.684
And so, but what had happened was ultimately

1372
00:52:30.684 --> 00:52:34.077
when the kids started coming home with Chlamydia,

1373
00:52:34.697 --> 00:52:36.230
Venereal Disease,

1374
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.222
Herpes Zoster.

1375
00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:41.504
Every sexually transmitted disease imaginable,

1376
00:52:41.504 --> 00:52:44.267
it would be impossible to believe even a scumbag like

1377
00:52:44.267 --> 00:52:46.774
Gary Hambright could be infected with that many diseases

1378
00:52:46.774 --> 00:52:48.021
and be ambulatory.

1379
00:52:48.021 --> 00:52:49.579
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Be actually able to walk.</v>

1380
00:52:49.579 --> 00:52:51.626
Something horrible was going on that concerns--

1381
00:52:51.626 --> 00:52:54.410
That, that had to do with a lot more than him.

1382
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.063
And I have no idea what it was,

1383
00:52:56.063 --> 00:52:58.592
but I do know he was one of the primary agents.

1384
00:52:58.592 --> 00:52:59.957
<v Regina>And we're talking about children</v>

1385
00:52:59.957 --> 00:53:01.076
under the age of five?

1386
00:53:01.076 --> 00:53:01.908
<v ->That is correct.</v>

1387
00:53:01.908 --> 00:53:05.343
When Gary Willard Hambright was indicted

1388
00:53:05.343 --> 00:53:09.758
by a federal grand jury in 1987, I believe.

1389
00:53:09.758 --> 00:53:12.244
Yes, it was '87, 'cause he was arrested in '87.

1390
00:53:12.244 --> 00:53:14.261
So when he was indicted by a federal grand jury,

1391
00:53:14.261 --> 00:53:16.766
he had no less than a dozen charges against children

1392
00:53:16.766 --> 00:53:18.378
that he was indicted for,

1393
00:53:18.378 --> 00:53:20.948
and not a single one of them was over the age of four.

1394
00:53:20.948 --> 00:53:24.158
And so Gary Willard Hambright himself

1395
00:53:24.158 --> 00:53:27.827
began to manifest the symptoms of AIDS.

1396
00:53:27.827 --> 00:53:31.401
And, horrendously, he died of AIDS while he was on trial,

1397
00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:34.162
and horrendously only in the sense of

1398
00:53:34.162 --> 00:53:36.391
it turned out that half a thousand children,

1399
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:37.853
over many years, even though the facility

1400
00:53:37.853 --> 00:53:39.944
could only house 250 kids,

1401
00:53:39.944 --> 00:53:41.735
we're talkin' about, he'd worked there for a good

1402
00:53:41.735 --> 00:53:43.026
three, four, five years.

1403
00:53:43.026 --> 00:53:44.124
So--

1404
00:53:44.124 --> 00:53:45.703
<v Regina>And he'd abused that many kids</v>

1405
00:53:45.703 --> 00:53:48.070
that 500 of them?
<v ->He'd abused at least half a thousand children.</v>

1406
00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:49.041
<v Regina>And that's all documented?</v>

1407
00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:50.065
Half, that half--

1408
00:53:50.065 --> 00:53:53.243
<v ->Was documented, because the child daycare center's</v>

1409
00:53:53.243 --> 00:53:55.846
records were kept at the community center

1410
00:53:55.846 --> 00:53:57.819
of the Presidio military base of San Francisco.
<v Regina>Jeez.</v>

1411
00:53:57.819 --> 00:54:02.819
<v ->And during the Autumnal Equinox of 1987,</v>

1412
00:54:02.981 --> 00:54:04.837
that facility was burned to the ground

1413
00:54:04.837 --> 00:54:07.045
in a $500,000 blaze.

1414
00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:08.666
And--
<v Regina>And all the records with it.</v>

1415
00:54:08.666 --> 00:54:09.894
<v ->And all the records with it.</v>

1416
00:54:11.244 --> 00:54:12.578
<v ->So, he's gone.</v>

1417
00:54:12.578 --> 00:54:16.407
The incident is, has, you know, is now just a matter of

1418
00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:18.325
lore, almost.

1419
00:54:18.325 --> 00:54:19.178
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

1420
00:54:19.178 --> 00:54:20.639
The ATF investigated that fire.

1421
00:54:20.639 --> 00:54:22.528
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms

1422
00:54:22.528 --> 00:54:24.213
confirmed it was arson.

1423
00:54:24.213 --> 00:54:26.816
And the United States Army said, "Well, we sent our

1424
00:54:26.816 --> 00:54:29.119
"investigators in, and they said it was an accident."

1425
00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:30.111
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1426
00:54:30.111 --> 00:54:32.372
<v ->And it was their territory, it's on federal property.</v>

1427
00:54:33.282 --> 00:54:34.398
Military property.

1428
00:54:34.398 --> 00:54:38.089
So the military jurisdiction overrode the ATF analysis.

1429
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:40.990
And after that, the parents of the,

1430
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.878
the impacted families of these children.

1431
00:54:42.878 --> 00:54:45.352
Obviously, some families had two or three children.

1432
00:54:45.352 --> 00:54:47.400
So half a thousand kids being impacted,

1433
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.769
and about two, 300 families impacted.

1434
00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:52.112
So the army's answer was,

1435
00:54:52.112 --> 00:54:54.960
let's transfer these poor saps all over the world,

1436
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.781
to Hell and gone.

1437
00:54:55.781 --> 00:54:56.688
<v Regina>So they separated them.</v>

1438
00:54:56.688 --> 00:54:57.477
<v ->They separated them.</v>

1439
00:54:57.477 --> 00:55:00.580
Some to Guam, some to Okinawa, some to the Philippines,

1440
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.117
Subic Bay was still open at the time.

1441
00:55:02.117 --> 00:55:03.023
Some to West Germany.

1442
00:55:03.023 --> 00:55:04.761
You know, all over the world, the four corners of the Earth.

1443
00:55:04.761 --> 00:55:07.065
But before they were all separated,

1444
00:55:07.065 --> 00:55:10.009
three weeks after the community center was burned

1445
00:55:10.009 --> 00:55:11.172
to the ground, they all got together,

1446
00:55:11.172 --> 00:55:13.006
and they burned the daycare center to the ground

1447
00:55:13.006 --> 00:55:14.073
en mass.

1448
00:55:14.073 --> 00:55:16.537
Like something out of a Frankenstein or Dracula film,

1449
00:55:16.537 --> 00:55:18.926
where all of the accursed villagers get together

1450
00:55:18.926 --> 00:55:20.323
and burn the evil, and

1451
00:55:20.323 --> 00:55:21.529
and excise it out.

1452
00:55:21.529 --> 00:55:24.174
And that was a $50,000 blaze.

1453
00:55:24.174 --> 00:55:25.795
And it didn't take any investigations to find out

1454
00:55:25.795 --> 00:55:26.957
who did that.

1455
00:55:26.957 --> 00:55:28.536
But the army didn't press any charges,

1456
00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:30.786
they just separated 'em all, and...

1457
00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:33.038
<v Regina>So this is the, this is the</v>

1458
00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:36.802
doings of one depraved individual, it appears.

1459
00:55:36.802 --> 00:55:39.149
Well, looking back on it.
<v ->Well, he was, yes that's right.</v>

1460
00:55:39.149 --> 00:55:41.399
<v Regina>And I'm just, I just wanted you to share</v>

1461
00:55:41.399 --> 00:55:43.352
what happened, because you were there.

1462
00:55:43.352 --> 00:55:45.559
So you had access to this knowledge.

1463
00:55:45.559 --> 00:55:49.208
Let's take it forward to, or out east,

1464
00:55:49.208 --> 00:55:51.202
to West Point Academy.
<v ->That's right.</v>

1465
00:55:51.202 --> 00:55:52.130
<v Regina>And what was going on there,</v>

1466
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.637
so we can see it in a little more institutionalized way.

1467
00:55:54.637 --> 00:55:55.565
<v ->That's correct.</v>

1468
00:55:55.565 --> 00:55:58.049
It wasn't only at the Presidio military base,

1469
00:55:58.049 --> 00:56:00.438
though the Presidio military base was

1470
00:56:00.438 --> 00:56:02.017
the center of the storm.

1471
00:56:02.017 --> 00:56:04.758
The storm's effects were felt nationwide.

1472
00:56:04.758 --> 00:56:08.363
And so, what had occurred was that

1473
00:56:08.363 --> 00:56:12.395
it turned out that at West Point on June of,

1474
00:56:12.395 --> 00:56:14.671
I believe it was '84, or

1475
00:56:17.325 --> 00:56:22.009
or between the years of '84 and '87, it was like the...

1476
00:56:22.009 --> 00:56:24.258
I'd have to look it up, but I certainly gave the correct date

1477
00:56:24.258 --> 00:56:26.210
in the presentation last night, but as you can remember--

1478
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:27.319
<v Regina>Yeah, you don't have notes with you right now.</v>

1479
00:56:27.319 --> 00:56:28.547
<v ->Right, I don't have notes with me right now,</v>

1480
00:56:28.547 --> 00:56:30.775
but you understand I remember the Presidio thing directly,

1481
00:56:30.775 --> 00:56:31.639
'cause I was there.

1482
00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:32.503
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1483
00:56:32.503 --> 00:56:33.772
<v ->But what happened at West Point was that</v>

1484
00:56:33.772 --> 00:56:38.167
a 22-month-old child was murdered by a Staff Sergeant.

1485
00:56:38.167 --> 00:56:40.470
He got off with 18 months' suspension, and--

1486
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:41.398
A suspension.

1487
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.136
And a dishonorable discharge.

1488
00:56:43.136 --> 00:56:45.132
So, back in those days, you could not sue

1489
00:56:45.132 --> 00:56:46.945
the federal government, constitutionally.

1490
00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:49.696
So no actions were taken against him.

1491
00:56:49.696 --> 00:56:51.253
Just a month later--

1492
00:56:51.253 --> 00:56:53.621
That happened in June, then in July of that year,

1493
00:56:53.621 --> 00:56:55.637
a young girl was brought in who was

1494
00:56:55.637 --> 00:56:58.549
under the age of four, into the emergency room

1495
00:56:58.549 --> 00:57:01.334
of West Point's hospital facilities.

1496
00:57:01.334 --> 00:57:03.050
She had a lacerated vagina.

1497
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:04.608
She said she had been sexually abused

1498
00:57:04.608 --> 00:57:06.004
at their daycare center.

1499
00:57:06.004 --> 00:57:07.839
And it turned out 50 other children were makin'

1500
00:57:07.839 --> 00:57:09.140
the same claims.

1501
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:13.502
And, well it turns out that the building number

1502
00:57:13.502 --> 00:57:15.401
for the daycare center at West Point

1503
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:17.013
was building number 666.

1504
00:57:17.013 --> 00:57:17.908
And--

1505
00:57:17.908 --> 00:57:20.052
<v Regina>So, do you feel in hindsight--</v>

1506
00:57:20.052 --> 00:57:22.046
I mean, looking at all of this, was the evidence that

1507
00:57:22.046 --> 00:57:24.595
this was ritualistic, to be able to utilize

1508
00:57:24.595 --> 00:57:26.056
the Satanic forces?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1509
00:57:26.056 --> 00:57:27.337
Abso, absolutely.

1510
00:57:27.337 --> 00:57:28.798
As I said, all the children referred to

1511
00:57:28.798 --> 00:57:30.728
my high school teacher as Mister Gary.

1512
00:57:30.728 --> 00:57:31.773
Gary Willard Hambright.

1513
00:57:31.773 --> 00:57:35.144
But they also described a Mikey, in perfect physical detail.

1514
00:57:35.144 --> 00:57:38.130
But that was Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino.

1515
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:39.463
He was not there.

1516
00:57:39.463 --> 00:57:41.597
And as I said, I got him off the hook because,

1517
00:57:42.697 --> 00:57:46.956
especially San Francisco Police Department investigator,

1518
00:57:46.956 --> 00:57:50.369
Sergeant Sandi Gallant, wanted to nail his heart to the wall.

1519
00:57:51.659 --> 00:57:53.242
She had a visceral loathing of him,

1520
00:57:53.242 --> 00:57:55.535
because she specialized in Satanic crime, and

1521
00:57:55.535 --> 00:57:57.284
(both speak at once)
<v Regina>So she knew what he was doing, yeah.</v>

1522
00:57:57.284 --> 00:57:58.671
<v ->She, she knew what he was about.</v>

1523
00:57:58.671 --> 00:58:01.742
But I had to tell her, "Look, it's not him.

1524
00:58:01.742 --> 00:58:04.569
"It's my high school teacher Gary Willard Hambright.

1525
00:58:04.569 --> 00:58:05.827
"I'll tell you where the evidence is."

1526
00:58:05.827 --> 00:58:08.419
Because of that, we were able to get an arrest made,

1527
00:58:08.419 --> 00:58:10.254
because he fell into San Francisco Police Department

1528
00:58:10.254 --> 00:58:13.763
jurisdiction, and I had to tell her, "Look.

1529
00:58:13.763 --> 00:58:15.736
"Physically, Colonel Aquino has not been here

1530
00:58:15.736 --> 00:58:16.717
"for this two years.

1531
00:58:16.717 --> 00:58:18.500
"He has been in Washington, DC.

1532
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.196
"I know, because I've had to handle all of

1533
00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:21.261
"his correspondence."

1534
00:58:21.261 --> 00:58:22.680
So--
<v Regina>But this was really important,</v>

1535
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.334
because this would never have been prosecuted

1536
00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.189
if it had been within the military.

1537
00:58:26.189 --> 00:58:28.183
<v ->That's correct, that is correct.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1538
00:58:28.183 --> 00:58:29.442
So that sets up this...

1539
00:58:29.442 --> 00:58:34.104
So, we have just a little bit of time left here,

1540
00:58:34.104 --> 00:58:35.757
and I guess my question would be, is,

1541
00:58:35.757 --> 00:58:38.188
we're hearing these really horrific stories

1542
00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:40.375
about what's happened within the military,

1543
00:58:40.375 --> 00:58:43.414
but how systemic are the Satanic practices,

1544
00:58:43.414 --> 00:58:44.641
to your understanding?

1545
00:58:44.641 --> 00:58:47.062
<v ->Well, as I said, with the molestation</v>

1546
00:58:47.062 --> 00:58:48.524
of all those children at West Point,

1547
00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.889
what happened was,

1548
00:58:49.889 --> 00:58:51.659
I forget his name, 'cause I don't have my notes

1549
00:58:51.659 --> 00:58:54.208
in front of me, but certainly many officers

1550
00:58:54.208 --> 00:58:57.207
besides the individual I quoted at my presentation,

1551
00:58:57.207 --> 00:58:59.616
many of the higher officers refused promotion

1552
00:58:59.616 --> 00:59:02.389
and ultimately resigned in protest,

1553
00:59:02.389 --> 00:59:04.288
based on the fact that their children had been

1554
00:59:04.288 --> 00:59:05.589
raped and abused,

1555
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:07.466
and nothing was being done

1556
00:59:07.466 --> 00:59:09.792
in terms of repudiation,

1557
00:59:09.792 --> 00:59:11.295
retributive justice.

1558
00:59:11.295 --> 00:59:13.578
So, they ultimately left the military,

1559
00:59:13.578 --> 00:59:16.404
and what happened was, with that officers' massacre,

1560
00:59:16.404 --> 00:59:19.145
so to speak, and that mass exodus

1561
00:59:19.145 --> 00:59:23.881
of more mundane, or secular, or Christian individuals,

1562
00:59:23.881 --> 00:59:25.886
or Godly individuals, if you would,

1563
00:59:25.886 --> 00:59:27.625
would say it that way.

1564
00:59:27.625 --> 00:59:31.774
Or that the lunatics took over the asylum,

1565
00:59:31.774 --> 00:59:33.011
is one way of putting it.

1566
00:59:33.011 --> 00:59:33.865
But...

1567
00:59:35.485 --> 00:59:36.581
I mean, Aquino's no lunatic.

1568
00:59:36.581 --> 00:59:39.182
So, in that sense, the Satanists took over.

1569
00:59:39.182 --> 00:59:40.089
So that--

1570
00:59:40.089 --> 00:59:41.945
<v Regina>So this is pervasive in the U.S. Military?</v>

1571
00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.107
<v ->I'd say it's predominant.</v>

1572
00:59:43.107 --> 00:59:44.878
<v Regina>Okay, kay.</v>
<v ->And as I gave the names of the</v>

1573
00:59:44.878 --> 00:59:49.819
two four-star Generals, the six...

1574
00:59:51.989 --> 00:59:53.222
I believe it was...

1575
00:59:54.412 --> 00:59:56.473
Well, I know that the several Brigadier Generals

1576
00:59:56.473 --> 00:59:58.052
and several Major Generals.

1577
00:59:58.052 --> 01:00:00.473
I had, had mentioned all of the ranks ongoing

1578
01:00:00.473 --> 01:00:03.118
in the lecture, of course I had my notes in front of me.

1579
01:00:03.118 --> 01:00:03.865
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1580
01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:05.135
<v ->But the number of Generals involved</v>

1581
01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.414
is astronomical.

1582
01:00:06.414 --> 01:00:10.079
(laughs) And it's so pervasive, in the fact that

1583
01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:12.820
they have incorporated the First Earth Battalion

1584
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.927
paraphernalia and agenda,

1585
01:00:16.927 --> 01:00:20.403
which was organized by Colonel Michael Aquino.

1586
01:00:22.103 --> 01:00:22.904
Through Jim Channing.

1587
01:00:22.904 --> 01:00:24.173
Through Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channing.

1588
01:00:24.173 --> 01:00:25.966
<v Regina>For anyone who's seen the movie.</v>

1589
01:00:25.966 --> 01:00:27.010
<v ->Yeah, mhmm, yeah.</v>

1590
01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:28.120
<v Regina>Rather silly movie, Men Who Stare at Goats,</v>

1591
01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.422
these are the characters we're talking about here.

1592
01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:31.789
<v ->That's right, and what I found so offensive about that film</v>

1593
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:36.524
was, of course, it takes a very serious,

1594
01:00:36.524 --> 01:00:39.267
and if you will, diabolical agenda,

1595
01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:41.217
and it turns it into something funny.

1596
01:00:41.217 --> 01:00:43.585
And it makes it looks almost lighthearted.

1597
01:00:43.585 --> 01:00:46.230
And besides from that, it's disinformation.

1598
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.438
Because in The Men Who Stare at Goats,

1599
01:00:48.438 --> 01:00:50.294
they bring up and emphasize this myth,

1600
01:00:50.294 --> 01:00:52.065
"Well, dogs are man's best friend.

1601
01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:54.497
"These guys are just too, you know, empathetic

1602
01:00:54.497 --> 01:00:56.822
"with the animals to do any harm to them,

1603
01:00:56.822 --> 01:00:58.615
"so they replace them with something that looks

1604
01:00:58.615 --> 01:01:01.163
"a bit more Satanic or diabolical, the goat.

1605
01:01:01.163 --> 01:01:02.859
"And that way, they can concentrate on tryin'

1606
01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:03.627
"to kill it.

1607
01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:05.579
"Yes, focusing their brain power."

1608
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.944
And all the rest of that,

1609
01:01:06.944 --> 01:01:09.473
and it's, it's such a load of crap,

1610
01:01:09.473 --> 01:01:11.617
because at the Presidio military base,

1611
01:01:11.617 --> 01:01:13.514
we had the Letterman Army Medical Center,

1612
01:01:13.514 --> 01:01:15.722
and the Letterman Army Medical Center

1613
01:01:15.722 --> 01:01:18.741
was ultimately responsible for training,

1614
01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:23.199
at all times, 25 percent of the army's medical doctors.

1615
01:01:23.199 --> 01:01:25.780
So, we're talkin' about an enormously influential

1616
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.519
institution within the army.

1617
01:01:27.519 --> 01:01:31.742
It was the first U.S. Military hospital as a structure.

1618
01:01:31.742 --> 01:01:33.811
As I said, until that point in time, the military was

1619
01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:35.946
taking advantage of other civilian hospitals,

1620
01:01:35.946 --> 01:01:37.619
or they were using field hospitals.

1621
01:01:37.619 --> 01:01:39.891
But it was like, one of the oldest military hospitals

1622
01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:41.683
in the United States, if not the oldest.

1623
01:01:41.683 --> 01:01:45.075
And, so as I said, we didn't have a firing range.

1624
01:01:45.075 --> 01:01:47.325
But there were places where they would test these weapons.

1625
01:01:47.325 --> 01:01:49.064
I was mentioning these drunken officers at night,

1626
01:01:49.064 --> 01:01:51.251
doing this on a lark in the playground.

1627
01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:53.362
But they had other specific test facilities

1628
01:01:53.362 --> 01:01:55.751
behind the Letterman Army Medical Center

1629
01:01:55.751 --> 01:01:58.077
that were more rangey, so to speak,

1630
01:01:58.077 --> 01:02:01.863
where they used thousands of dogs to test ballistics on.

1631
01:02:01.863 --> 01:02:05.480
And that means explosive ammunition, full auto,

1632
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.943
poison ammunition, anything you could imagine.

1633
01:02:07.943 --> 01:02:09.596
Frag and shrapnel ammunition,

1634
01:02:09.596 --> 01:02:12.870
and, as I showed photos of the other night,

1635
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:15.890
some of the dogs obviously died in medical procedures.

1636
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:17.884
Where they were totally exsanguinated.

1637
01:02:17.884 --> 01:02:19.835
Every amount of blood taken from their body,

1638
01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:22.064
the sexual organs removed, the skin removed.

1639
01:02:22.064 --> 01:02:23.664
And just dumped at the side of the road.

1640
01:02:23.664 --> 01:02:25.680
Now this is where the (claps) strangeness comes in.

1641
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.357
Is (claps) why not dispose of them in a medical facility,

1642
01:02:28.357 --> 01:02:29.328
in a medical fashion?

1643
01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:32.602
But no, they're taken out, and they're left at places.

1644
01:02:32.602 --> 01:02:33.882
This was ritualistic.

1645
01:02:33.882 --> 01:02:36.389
This was done in a sacrificial manner.

1646
01:02:36.389 --> 01:02:38.085
And that was what Lieutenant Colonel kept,

1647
01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:40.123
kept talking about.

1648
01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:43.332
"Well, no one is going to harm a goat on my base!"

1649
01:02:43.332 --> 01:02:46.373
Because the goat and the ram are the totenic,

1650
01:02:46.373 --> 01:02:51.247
totemic animals of the Baal, Baphomet,

1651
01:02:51.247 --> 01:02:54.854
the theistic Satanic theol, paradigm.

1652
01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.712
And, so they were, they were killin' dogs.

1653
01:02:57.712 --> 01:03:00.613
And that shows you the lack of empathy these sociopaths

1654
01:03:00.613 --> 01:03:02.565
and psychotics had.

1655
01:03:02.565 --> 01:03:04.624
And, so--

1656
01:03:04.624 --> 01:03:07.248
And by that, I'm talkin' about all of the MDs,

1657
01:03:07.248 --> 01:03:09.477
and all of the technicians, and all the ballistics experts

1658
01:03:09.477 --> 01:03:11.983
who were involved at the Presidio military base.

1659
01:03:11.983 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Regina>Well, and they did experiments on humans too,</v>

1660
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.351
didn't they?

1661
01:03:14.351 --> 01:03:15.355
<v ->They did indeed.</v>

1662
01:03:15.355 --> 01:03:17.819
And as I showed photographic evidence of last night,

1663
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:21.252
for years while I was working at the Presidio military base

1664
01:03:21.252 --> 01:03:22.361
of San Francisco,

1665
01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:24.035
they experimented on prisoners.

1666
01:03:24.035 --> 01:03:26.083
And these prisoners went, if you will,

1667
01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:27.758
willingly, in the sense that

1668
01:03:27.758 --> 01:03:30.030
you can never call it willingly, because they're prisoners.

1669
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.726
But at the same time, they went willingly

1670
01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:33.091
in the sense that they were offered

1671
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:34.585
revocation of sentences.

1672
01:03:34.585 --> 01:03:36.664
They were offered pardons,

1673
01:03:36.664 --> 01:03:39.203
sometimes in full, sometimes in part.

1674
01:03:39.203 --> 01:03:41.805
They were offered shortening of sentences,

1675
01:03:41.805 --> 01:03:44.423
and are, or...

1676
01:03:45.495 --> 01:03:47.373
Just so many deals that they could get.

1677
01:03:47.373 --> 01:03:48.812
Even extra privileges in prison

1678
01:03:48.812 --> 01:03:51.971
if they would volunteer for various medical experiments.

1679
01:03:51.971 --> 01:03:53.730
Some of them were quite funny,

1680
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:56.215
and like, when I was working at the library--

1681
01:03:56.215 --> 01:03:58.167
And this is how I was involved with them, was because

1682
01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.514
all these prisoners, while they were on base,

1683
01:04:00.514 --> 01:04:03.021
and isolated in experimentation,

1684
01:04:03.021 --> 01:04:04.555
had to have something to read.

1685
01:04:04.555 --> 01:04:07.521
And so in that sense, they were escorted by the

1686
01:04:07.521 --> 01:04:08.641
military police, the MPs,

1687
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.657
up to the Presidio military base library,

1688
01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:13.355
where I would allow them to peruse the contents

1689
01:04:13.355 --> 01:04:16.235
of the library and then take and borrow reading materials.

1690
01:04:16.235 --> 01:04:20.161
And, so the funny things would be like,

1691
01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:21.600
experiments where the doctors were feedin' them

1692
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.806
nothin' but salmon.

1693
01:04:22.806 --> 01:04:25.333
For six months, salmon tofu, salmon burgers,

1694
01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:27.498
just salmon everything.

1695
01:04:27.498 --> 01:04:29.930
And then these guys'd come in, just to the point of madness,

1696
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:32.276
"Ah, I got a candy bar!

1697
01:04:32.276 --> 01:04:34.155
"Oh, a candy bar!"

1698
01:04:34.155 --> 01:04:34.996
(laughter)

1699
01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:36.457
Just, like you know, and I'd have to hide

1700
01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:38.218
the candies, everything, you know.

1701
01:04:38.218 --> 01:04:39.871
Just, you know, "Oh!"

1702
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:42.197
Just, just drooling over, you know, just,

1703
01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:45.236
"Oh, the Hershey's, please!"

1704
01:04:45.236 --> 01:04:46.835
And, and it was just, you know,

1705
01:04:46.835 --> 01:04:48.041
and all of them because they're on,

1706
01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.505
it's a salmon diet, and whatever protein was in there,

1707
01:04:50.505 --> 01:04:51.454
whatever agent was in there,

1708
01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:52.542
whether they're black or caucasian,

1709
01:04:52.542 --> 01:04:54.079
they were turning orange.

1710
01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:55.752
Just all of them were just turning orange,

1711
01:04:55.752 --> 01:04:57.395
just, you know, over this period of months.

1712
01:04:57.395 --> 01:04:58.397
(mumbles)

1713
01:04:58.397 --> 01:05:00.627
But these are, are more harmless.

1714
01:05:00.627 --> 01:05:01.971
And they were probably just given priven,

1715
01:05:01.971 --> 01:05:04.392
prison privileges, or maybe some really moderate

1716
01:05:04.392 --> 01:05:06.249
sentence reductions for something like that.

1717
01:05:06.249 --> 01:05:09.245
But some of the experiments were far more sinister.

1718
01:05:09.245 --> 01:05:12.798
And, and some of these men would disappear.

1719
01:05:12.798 --> 01:05:13.746
Off the records.

1720
01:05:13.746 --> 01:05:15.324
Completely.

1721
01:05:15.324 --> 01:05:17.992
And in the prison system, that can happen,

1722
01:05:17.992 --> 01:05:19.016
all too often.

1723
01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:23.153
And the military system cooperating with the prison system,

1724
01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.862
you have kind of an unholy alliance.

1725
01:05:25.862 --> 01:05:28.604
And as I showed from the severed head

1726
01:05:28.604 --> 01:05:31.718
that I had displayed on my photograph last night,

1727
01:05:31.718 --> 01:05:33.831
obviously, one of those prisoners died screaming

1728
01:05:33.831 --> 01:05:35.056
in terror and pain.

1729
01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.286
<v Regina>Right, so it was probably some ritualistic thing?</v>

1730
01:05:37.286 --> 01:05:39.099
<v ->It had to be, it had to be.
<v Regina>Or, yeah yeah.</v>

1731
01:05:39.099 --> 01:05:41.308
<v ->Because the head wasn't disposed of</v>

1732
01:05:41.308 --> 01:05:42.533
in some medical fashion.

1733
01:05:42.533 --> 01:05:45.786
In an incinerator, or a bath of acid or anything like that.

1734
01:05:45.786 --> 01:05:47.046
<v Regina>And why was it separated from the body</v>

1735
01:05:47.046 --> 01:05:47.781
to begin with?

1736
01:05:47.781 --> 01:05:49.638
<v ->It was separated from the body, obviously ritualistically,</v>

1737
01:05:49.638 --> 01:05:52.399
and left in a, in a place--

1738
01:05:52.399 --> 01:05:54.917
You have to remember that all 1,500 acres

1739
01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.420
of the Presidio military base

1740
01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.811
are desecrated Indian burial ground.

1741
01:05:58.811 --> 01:06:03.129
This was the tribal burial grounds of the Ohlone

1742
01:06:03.129 --> 01:06:04.409
First Persons Nation.

1743
01:06:04.409 --> 01:06:07.822
That had been stolen by the Spaniards, the conquistadors

1744
01:06:07.822 --> 01:06:12.206
in 1776, established as a Captaincy of Spain,

1745
01:06:12.206 --> 01:06:15.363
and ultimately taken by the Americans in turn.

1746
01:06:15.363 --> 01:06:18.894
Told in, or turned into the headquarters of

1747
01:06:18.894 --> 01:06:20.174
The Western Defense Command,

1748
01:06:20.174 --> 01:06:22.126
one of the most important military bases

1749
01:06:22.126 --> 01:06:24.536
in the constellation of bases in the United States.

1750
01:06:25.686 --> 01:06:28.586
Responsible for the logistical center focus of all

1751
01:06:28.586 --> 01:06:30.529
deployments overseas to the Pacific,

1752
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:33.183
from, and to South America

1753
01:06:33.183 --> 01:06:35.850
via the Pacific coast.

1754
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:38.986
Throughout World War One, World War Two,

1755
01:06:38.986 --> 01:06:41.332
Korea, Vietnam, saw far more action than

1756
01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:43.563
most eastern military bases, in that sense,

1757
01:06:43.563 --> 01:06:45.183
as a logistical center point.

1758
01:06:45.183 --> 01:06:48.415
So, and ultimately even with all of that going on,

1759
01:06:48.415 --> 01:06:49.802
it still had to be closed.

1760
01:06:49.802 --> 01:06:52.478
Because of the enormity of the scandals that took place.

1761
01:06:52.478 --> 01:06:55.050
It was ultimately closed as a base in 1994.

1762
01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:59.369
And surrendered to the U.S. Park Facilities.

1763
01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:02.207
And they, in turn, abused their ownership of it by,

1764
01:07:02.207 --> 01:07:04.947
or management of it, by turning it over to private,

1765
01:07:04.947 --> 01:07:07.891
absentee landlords like George Lucas, through Lucasfilms.

1766
01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:11.123
So, and the military base, Letterman Army Medical Center,

1767
01:07:11.123 --> 01:07:13.138
of course it goes without saying, was torn down.

1768
01:07:13.138 --> 01:07:14.931
I showed a photograph of it in the presentation,

1769
01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:16.221
of it being deconstructed.

1770
01:07:16.221 --> 01:07:18.087
Whatever evidence could be found of that

1771
01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:19.197
was also taken (mumbles).

1772
01:07:19.197 --> 01:07:20.318
<v Regina>So, it's dark history</v>

1773
01:07:20.318 --> 01:07:24.700
about the experimentation, the sexual abuse of children,

1774
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.887
the Satanic rituals.

1775
01:07:26.887 --> 01:07:30.439
All of that is essentially gone, disbanded from that area.

1776
01:07:30.439 --> 01:07:32.828
<v ->That's right.
<v Regina>But it's not gone from the military?</v>

1777
01:07:32.828 --> 01:07:33.969
<v ->No, no.</v>

1778
01:07:33.969 --> 01:07:35.516
And in terms of the Presidio itself,

1779
01:07:35.516 --> 01:07:38.866
I recommend any tourist who wants to occupy themselves

1780
01:07:38.866 --> 01:07:42.139
doing this, is welcome to go to the Presidio military base,

1781
01:07:42.139 --> 01:07:46.363
check out places that I've pointed out and,

1782
01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.123
but one of the most fascinating and sinister aspects

1783
01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:50.641
of it is, we have to remember, it was a coastal garrison.

1784
01:07:50.641 --> 01:07:55.494
Had enormous batteries of cannonade to protect the coast

1785
01:07:55.494 --> 01:07:56.741
from incoming ships.

1786
01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:58.985
And as a matter of fact, the

1787
01:08:00.293 --> 01:08:03.845
community center, which was adjacent to the daycare center,

1788
01:08:03.845 --> 01:08:06.523
was also right behind the building

1789
01:08:06.523 --> 01:08:10.928
of Colonel Aquino's Intelligence Defense command

1790
01:08:10.928 --> 01:08:15.518
where he did systems analysis for military intelligence.

1791
01:08:15.518 --> 01:08:18.750
So, we have all of these facilities right next to each other

1792
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.093
in this convenient cluster,

1793
01:08:20.093 --> 01:08:22.781
and I know for a fact, because I destroyed the maps,

1794
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:26.227
they were all connected with an underground series

1795
01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:28.104
of tunnels, because in the old days,

1796
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:31.080
these were all artillery batteries that were bunkered.

1797
01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.322
The bunkers were interconnected by a tunnel system,

1798
01:08:34.322 --> 01:08:36.530
of blast tunnels, to protect themselves from enemy

1799
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:37.576
bombardment.

1800
01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:38.973
As we entered the atomic age,

1801
01:08:38.973 --> 01:08:40.786
they became expanded and lead-lined

1802
01:08:40.786 --> 01:08:42.664
to protect themselves from nuclear fallout.

1803
01:08:42.664 --> 01:08:45.265
So we have an enormously complex and well-fortified

1804
01:08:45.265 --> 01:08:46.769
series of bunker systems,

1805
01:08:46.769 --> 01:08:49.724
but as they took the cannon out, as cannon became obsolete,

1806
01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:51.739
there were Nike Zeus missiles that were

1807
01:08:51.739 --> 01:08:53.894
at the Presidio military base for a short while.

1808
01:08:53.894 --> 01:08:55.195
They were taken away.

1809
01:08:56.515 --> 01:08:58.251
But in the meantime, all of these bunkers

1810
01:08:58.251 --> 01:08:59.371
weren't being used for anything,

1811
01:08:59.371 --> 01:09:01.408
so the one that was the central facility,

1812
01:09:01.408 --> 01:09:03.596
the central bunker that was near all of the buildings

1813
01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:05.354
I just described, was converted into the central

1814
01:09:05.354 --> 01:09:07.146
Satanic ritual center.

1815
01:09:08.156 --> 01:09:09.278
Everyone knew it was that.

1816
01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.677
Everyone saw the trappings, the pentagrams,

1817
01:09:11.677 --> 01:09:15.314
the chalices for blood, all the rest of that was there,

1818
01:09:15.314 --> 01:09:18.172
on public display for anyone who cared to look.

1819
01:09:18.172 --> 01:09:20.700
And everybody knew this was an essential part,

1820
01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.257
and they just said, "Aw, it's an alternative religion.

1821
01:09:22.257 --> 01:09:23.538
"Freedom of religion."

1822
01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:24.998
This is why Colonel Aquino could go around

1823
01:09:24.998 --> 01:09:26.811
in full, white pancake makeup,

1824
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:29.105
full-face white pancake makeup, the clipped eyebrows,

1825
01:09:29.105 --> 01:09:31.153
the 666 tattooed on his scalp.

1826
01:09:31.153 --> 01:09:32.827
The widow's peak.
(cell phone rings)

1827
01:09:32.827 --> 01:09:34.171
Sorry about that phone.

1828
01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.590
I should have had that on silent.

1829
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:37.659
So, what had happened was even though

1830
01:09:37.659 --> 01:09:41.371
the Satanic ritual chamber was onsite,

1831
01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:43.045
and everyone knew of it,

1832
01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:46.245
it was always dismissed and belittled as an

1833
01:09:46.245 --> 01:09:47.504
alternative religion.

1834
01:09:47.504 --> 01:09:49.498
This is just part of the new spirituality.

1835
01:09:49.498 --> 01:09:52.165
And this is why Colonel Aquino himself

1836
01:09:52.165 --> 01:09:55.122
could go around, on base, in full uniform,

1837
01:09:55.122 --> 01:09:57.488
in full-faced white pancake makeup,

1838
01:09:57.488 --> 01:09:59.279
the clipped eyebrows, the widow's peak,

1839
01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:01.604
the 666 tattooed on his scalp.

1840
01:10:01.604 --> 01:10:04.858
And he could do this in full appearance

1841
01:10:04.858 --> 01:10:07.311
because he was constitutionally

1842
01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:09.796
in defense of the freedom of religion.

1843
01:10:09.796 --> 01:10:11.749
He was constitutionally protected by the

1844
01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:14.585
freedom of religion, and it was one of the reasons why

1845
01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.899
he was officially recognized by The United States Army

1846
01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:20.249
as their official Satanic Chaplain.

1847
01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:25.080
And as a result of that, he paved the way for,

1848
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.425
in a positive sense, (laughs) perhaps,

1849
01:10:26.425 --> 01:10:28.941
pioneered the way for Wiccan Chaplains,

1850
01:10:28.941 --> 01:10:30.425
Pagan Chaplains,

1851
01:10:31.665 --> 01:10:35.112
depending on what one feels about religious permissiveness,

1852
01:10:35.112 --> 01:10:38.995
I'd certainly, I'm not as threatened or I don't feel

1853
01:10:38.995 --> 01:10:40.637
any of us are as threatened by,

1854
01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:42.333
but to some people it's all equated.

1855
01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.104
But it was definitely,

1856
01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:47.442
he pioneered the way for,

1857
01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:48.904
perhaps in a more positive sense,

1858
01:10:48.904 --> 01:10:49.992
Buddhist Chaplains.

1859
01:10:49.992 --> 01:10:51.154
(laughter)

1860
01:10:51.154 --> 01:10:52.200
But...

1861
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.464
<v Regina>Well, small blessings within all of that.</v>

1862
01:10:55.464 --> 01:10:56.840
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

1863
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.629
That's right.

1864
01:10:57.629 --> 01:10:59.485
<v Regina>Well, when you look at this in its totality,</v>

1865
01:11:01.985 --> 01:11:06.216
if you were speaking to a kid

1866
01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:08.292
who's looking for a path in life,

1867
01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:09.710
and you've, you were in the military,

1868
01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.545
your father in the military 30 years.

1869
01:11:11.545 --> 01:11:12.355
<v ->Yes.</v>

1870
01:11:12.355 --> 01:11:14.307
<v Regina>What would you tell them today?</v>

1871
01:11:14.307 --> 01:11:16.910
<v ->I would tell them to stay out of the military!</v>

1872
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:19.608
That's a, that's definitely one thing I would emphasize,

1873
01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:22.585
is that, as I emphasized last night,

1874
01:11:22.585 --> 01:11:24.461
what has happened increasingly,

1875
01:11:24.461 --> 01:11:25.853
and...

1876
01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:28.290
My perspective on this is rather interesting.

1877
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:29.037
I do bel--

1878
01:11:29.037 --> 01:11:32.824
I do blame the American military's descent into Hell,

1879
01:11:32.824 --> 01:11:33.655
literally,

1880
01:11:33.655 --> 01:11:35.534
on the cessation of the draft.

1881
01:11:35.534 --> 01:11:38.690
But interestingly enough, you're kind of caught

1882
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:39.927
between a rock and a hard place,

1883
01:11:39.927 --> 01:11:41.548
because one of the things that thinned the ranks

1884
01:11:41.548 --> 01:11:45.153
of the officer corps of the conventional salt of the Earth

1885
01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:47.829
American background,

1886
01:11:48.959 --> 01:11:50.571
was the Vietnam War.

1887
01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:53.968
As I pointed out, I need to emphasize the fact that

1888
01:11:53.968 --> 01:11:57.087
people look at the Vietnam Memorial Wall.

1889
01:11:57.264 --> 01:11:59.099
They see about 57,000 names.

1890
01:11:59.099 --> 01:12:00.954
And I keep emphasizing, "Look.

1891
01:12:00.954 --> 01:12:03.557
"That wall was not set up by your U.S. Government.

1892
01:12:03.557 --> 01:12:07.545
"Was a young Asian, South Vietnamese immigre

1893
01:12:07.545 --> 01:12:10.265
"from the Republic of South Vietnam who appreciated

1894
01:12:10.265 --> 01:12:12.420
"the sacrifices that the Americans had made

1895
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.905
"to defend her anti-communist republic so much,

1896
01:12:14.905 --> 01:12:19.011
"she conceptualized and designed, and ultimately led

1897
01:12:19.011 --> 01:12:21.593
"to the funding, of the Vietnam Memorial Wall."

1898
01:12:21.593 --> 01:12:24.430
If your government, the U.S. Government had had a choice

1899
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.659
in the matter, they would've had everyone just forget

1900
01:12:26.659 --> 01:12:29.507
the Vietnam War, and allow it to languish into,

1901
01:12:29.507 --> 01:12:31.591
into memory.

1902
01:12:32.899 --> 01:12:34.008
Or the absence thereof.

1903
01:12:34.008 --> 01:12:36.781
But the Vietnam Memorial Wall puts it in everybody's face.

1904
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:39.170
That's in spite of the U.S. Government, not because of it.

1905
01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:41.058
It's very difficult to get a name on the wall,

1906
01:12:41.058 --> 01:12:44.215
because many of the men who were injured in theater,

1907
01:12:44.215 --> 01:12:46.743
thanks to modern technology of medivac,

1908
01:12:46.743 --> 01:12:48.972
the medical evacuation via helicopter,

1909
01:12:48.972 --> 01:12:53.313
then to Saigon, then to a plane, on a cargo transport plane,

1910
01:12:53.313 --> 01:12:55.820
or a personnel transport plane to Hawaii,

1911
01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:56.907
then to the United States.

1912
01:12:56.907 --> 01:12:58.583
Many of these men critically injured in Vietnam

1913
01:12:58.583 --> 01:12:59.841
would die in Hawaii,

1914
01:12:59.841 --> 01:13:01.345
or they would die in The United States.

1915
01:13:01.345 --> 01:13:02.582
They're not counted as combat fatalities.

1916
01:13:02.582 --> 01:13:03.809
<v Regina>Right, it doesn't count, huh.</v>

1917
01:13:03.809 --> 01:13:05.687
Okay.
<v ->And so there's far more men.</v>

1918
01:13:05.687 --> 01:13:08.192
Double, triple the number of men died in Vietnam

1919
01:13:08.192 --> 01:13:09.493
than are on that wall.

1920
01:13:09.493 --> 01:13:11.883
And as wonderful as that wall is,

1921
01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:14.901
it cannot serve its purpose until we recognize this.

1922
01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:17.323
<v Regina>Well, and many died in a larger sense,</v>

1923
01:13:17.323 --> 01:13:18.368
even while they were living.

1924
01:13:18.368 --> 01:13:19.391
<v ->Of course, of course.</v>

1925
01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:20.895
<v Regina>You've talked about the homeless statistics</v>

1926
01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:21.845
in the very beginning.

1927
01:13:21.845 --> 01:13:22.805
<v ->That, that's right.</v>

1928
01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:24.447
And, but beyond that,

1929
01:13:25.767 --> 01:13:27.054
also missing in action.

1930
01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:28.792
There are many men missing in action

1931
01:13:28.792 --> 01:13:30.328
who are not on that wall.

1932
01:13:30.328 --> 01:13:33.112
And we can only assume, logically, that the vast majority

1933
01:13:33.112 --> 01:13:34.765
of them are dead, certainly at this point.

1934
01:13:34.765 --> 01:13:35.868
And,

1935
01:13:36.738 --> 01:13:39.149
and with that in mind, that wall is not the end all

1936
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:41.218
be all in terms of the statistics of fatalities.

1937
01:13:41.218 --> 01:13:42.819
So I'm tryin' to tell people beyond that,

1938
01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:46.903
there were 600,000 men in Vietnam at any one time.

1939
01:13:46.903 --> 01:13:48.994
Certainly from 1968 on.

1940
01:13:48.994 --> 01:13:50.850
At least half a million men would be in country.

1941
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.196
You count that for the 11 years of the Vietnam War,

1942
01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:56.449
you're talkin' about a good 11 to 12 million men,

1943
01:13:56.449 --> 01:13:58.422
cycled in and out of Vietnam.

1944
01:13:58.422 --> 01:14:01.719
So 20,000 officers killed, which is what I destroyed

1945
01:14:01.719 --> 01:14:03.180
the documents concerning,

1946
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.526
died by fragging, killed by their own men.

1947
01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:07.851
That's what really thinned the ranks of the Officer Corps

1948
01:14:07.851 --> 01:14:08.844
in the beginning.

1949
01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.508
<v Regina>And then was this partly because of the</v>

1950
01:14:10.508 --> 01:14:11.829
nature of that war?

1951
01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:12.992
(clears throat)
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

1952
01:14:12.992 --> 01:14:13.984
You see--

1953
01:14:13.984 --> 01:14:16.033
<v Regina>I mean, there were such, such incredible</v>

1954
01:14:16.033 --> 01:14:17.376
wearing down the psyche, and--

1955
01:14:17.376 --> 01:14:18.165
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

1956
01:14:18.165 --> 01:14:19.670
And what I try to emphasize to people is,

1957
01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:20.693
I was a Marine.

1958
01:14:20.693 --> 01:14:23.850
Obviously I was too young for Vietnam.

1959
01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.962
I was in Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

1960
01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.895
But as a Marine, I can tell you that

1961
01:14:28.895 --> 01:14:30.656
during the Vietnam War,

1962
01:14:30.656 --> 01:14:32.425
people were drafted into the Marine Corps.

1963
01:14:32.425 --> 01:14:33.577
People don't understand that, in those days,

1964
01:14:33.577 --> 01:14:35.391
you didn't volunteer to be a Marine.

1965
01:14:35.391 --> 01:14:38.761
You could, but you could be drafted into a Marine.

1966
01:14:38.761 --> 01:14:41.055
They'd line the guys up at the induction centers,

1967
01:14:41.055 --> 01:14:43.711
and they would just say, "Every fifth person in this line

1968
01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:44.937
"will be a Marine."

1969
01:14:44.937 --> 01:14:46.954
Literally, can you imagine standing in that line

1970
01:14:46.954 --> 01:14:48.767
and suddenly you're, "You're number five!

1971
01:14:48.767 --> 01:14:49.768
"You're number 10!

1972
01:14:49.768 --> 01:14:50.675
"You're number 15."
<v Regina>No.</v>

1973
01:14:50.675 --> 01:14:51.667
<v ->"You're a Marine!"</v>

1974
01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:55.240
And then, so these guys were not only drafted,

1975
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.186
but in, in the Marines in Vietnam, they had the disadvantage

1976
01:14:59.186 --> 01:15:02.578
of medical, excuse me, of military transport

1977
01:15:02.578 --> 01:15:04.135
done by helicopter.

1978
01:15:04.135 --> 01:15:05.694
And thanks to helicopter warfare,

1979
01:15:05.694 --> 01:15:08.157
they were transported from combat site to combat site,

1980
01:15:08.157 --> 01:15:11.751
so they saw combat every day that they were in Vietnam.

1981
01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:13.746
The Marine in World War Two

1982
01:15:13.746 --> 01:15:15.234
had it easy.

1983
01:15:15.537 --> 01:15:16.584
And this is what I keep tellin' people.

1984
01:15:16.584 --> 01:15:19.047
The battle in Iwo Jima, the battles in Okinawa,

1985
01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.668
these are monumental battles.

1986
01:15:20.668 --> 01:15:21.802
These are terrible battles.

1987
01:15:21.802 --> 01:15:24.169
These are apocalyptic battles that took their toll

1988
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:26.911
and killed battalion after battalion of Marines.

1989
01:15:26.911 --> 01:15:29.097
But after these intense battles,

1990
01:15:29.097 --> 01:15:30.621
which would last for a month,

1991
01:15:30.621 --> 01:15:32.456
you know, at the most,

1992
01:15:32.456 --> 01:15:35.496
you have this logistical buildup period,

1993
01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:36.798
then this intense conflict,

1994
01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.867
but the rest of the war, their four years in the service,

1995
01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:41.095
would be maybe one battle a year.

1996
01:15:41.095 --> 01:15:43.997
So you're talkin' about like, the average Marine would spend

1997
01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:46.439
a good six months waiting for the next buildup.

1998
01:15:46.439 --> 01:15:48.851
And so they had plenty of time to recuperate,

1999
01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:51.335
to regather themselves, to come to grips with

2000
01:15:51.335 --> 01:15:53.148
whatever issues they're contending with,

2001
01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.868
spiritually or otherwise, in terms of their mortality.

2002
01:15:55.868 --> 01:15:57.745
And then go into the next battle.

2003
01:15:57.745 --> 01:16:00.902
Kay, in Vietnam, they're statistically saw

2004
01:16:00.902 --> 01:16:03.963
10 times the combat of any World War Two Marine.

2005
01:16:03.963 --> 01:16:05.734
Just every day was under fire.

2006
01:16:05.734 --> 01:16:08.539
You're just flown from one combat zone to another

2007
01:16:08.539 --> 01:16:09.724
every single day.

2008
01:16:09.724 --> 01:16:12.027
By the end of that nine months in service,

2009
01:16:12.027 --> 01:16:13.766
because they spent three months in basic training,

2010
01:16:13.766 --> 01:16:14.832
then nine months in service,

2011
01:16:14.832 --> 01:16:16.507
by the end of your tour of duty after a year,

2012
01:16:16.507 --> 01:16:18.480
you were a shattered wreck.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

2013
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.526
<v ->That was just a,</v>

2014
01:16:19.526 --> 01:16:21.562
you just, could you imagine coming home after that

2015
01:16:21.562 --> 01:16:23.930
with just spending every day for nine months

2016
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.167
under fire?

2017
01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:28.836
And in terms of that, many of the men took it out

2018
01:16:28.836 --> 01:16:31.066
on their officers, so they fragged them,

2019
01:16:31.066 --> 01:16:33.200
which meant to kill them, to kill their own officers.

2020
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.407
And that Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channing,

2021
01:16:35.407 --> 01:16:37.285
I told you about, that became the battering ram

2022
01:16:37.285 --> 01:16:38.372
for Colonel Aquino,

2023
01:16:38.372 --> 01:16:41.785
he himself was an officer in a platoon where,

2024
01:16:41.785 --> 01:16:43.343
excuse me, in a battalion.

2025
01:16:43.343 --> 01:16:45.625
He was a Platoon Commander in a battalion

2026
01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:49.219
where he was the only survivor out of five other Officers

2027
01:16:49.219 --> 01:16:51.384
within a five-month period of time!

2028
01:16:51.384 --> 01:16:52.195
<v Regina>Jeez.</v>

2029
01:16:52.195 --> 01:16:54.605
<v ->And, as I said, the largest race riots</v>

2030
01:16:54.605 --> 01:16:56.099
in American prison history

2031
01:16:56.099 --> 01:16:57.677
did not take place in The United States.

2032
01:16:57.677 --> 01:16:59.746
They took place in the military brig,

2033
01:16:59.746 --> 01:17:03.437
the military imprisonment facility at Long Binh Jail.

2034
01:17:03.437 --> 01:17:05.314
Everyone called it L.B.J., in Saigon.

2035
01:17:05.314 --> 01:17:09.197
In South Vietnam, where you had thousands

2036
01:17:09.197 --> 01:17:10.956
of blacks and whites goin' at each other

2037
01:17:10.956 --> 01:17:13.836
in the prison facility over there, in a big gang war.

2038
01:17:13.836 --> 01:17:16.716
And what were most of these men in L.B.J. for?

2039
01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:18.103
Fragging their Officers!

2040
01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:21.985
So, the idea of 20,000 Officers, even though the military

2041
01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:23.073
will deny it officially,

2042
01:17:23.073 --> 01:17:25.217
I destroyed the documents, I know 20,000 Officers died.

2043
01:17:25.217 --> 01:17:27.286
Vietnam was the most dangerous war in the history

2044
01:17:27.286 --> 01:17:28.822
of mankind to be an Officer.

2045
01:17:28.822 --> 01:17:32.355
And as a result, the Officers' Corps was so eviscerated.

2046
01:17:32.355 --> 01:17:35.544
All of these good ol' boys, the old boys' network of,

2047
01:17:35.544 --> 01:17:37.346
these wholesome types,

2048
01:17:37.346 --> 01:17:39.373
they were all gone, and that's where men like

2049
01:17:39.373 --> 01:17:42.338
Colonel Aquino filled the vacuum.

2050
01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:46.381
And with the final child molestation apocalypse

2051
01:17:46.381 --> 01:17:49.122
that took place within the homeland of The United States,

2052
01:17:49.122 --> 01:17:50.562
where many other Officers,

2053
01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:53.228
the younger post-Vietnam wave resigned,

2054
01:17:53.228 --> 01:17:55.137
he gained total control.

2055
01:17:56.127 --> 01:17:57.555
So, there's no other way of looking at it,

2056
01:17:57.555 --> 01:17:59.966
than your American Military, the United States Military

2057
01:17:59.966 --> 01:18:02.326
is Satanic, at this point.

2058
01:18:02.326 --> 01:18:04.639
It's got Satanic high command structure.

2059
01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:05.972
At this point in history.

2060
01:18:05.972 --> 01:18:07.594
There is no other way to look at it.

2061
01:18:07.594 --> 01:18:09.983
I know that from the,

2062
01:18:09.983 --> 01:18:11.561
from the depth of what I was working with.

2063
01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:12.931
And, so,

2064
01:18:13.673 --> 01:18:15.998
and here's where the prison environment comes in, too.

2065
01:18:15.998 --> 01:18:18.366
After they got rid of the draft,

2066
01:18:18.366 --> 01:18:20.926
of course America's never been a prison cul--

2067
01:18:20.926 --> 01:18:22.761
Excuse me, never been a warrior culture

2068
01:18:22.761 --> 01:18:24.201
in the sense that I mentioned,

2069
01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:25.448
so it doesn't have a traditional--

2070
01:18:25.448 --> 01:18:26.654
<v Regina>As the Japanese and others, yes.</v>

2071
01:18:26.654 --> 01:18:28.606
<v ->Yeah, yeah it doesn't have a milit, a warrior caste.</v>

2072
01:18:28.606 --> 01:18:32.136
So as a result, they have to count on whoever they can take

2073
01:18:32.136 --> 01:18:33.417
to go in their military.

2074
01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.272
So after the Vietnam War, there was tremendous

2075
01:18:35.272 --> 01:18:36.754
personnel and staff problem.

2076
01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.216
And they're wondering, "Well, what do we do?

2077
01:18:38.216 --> 01:18:39.538
"How do we get more people in here?"

2078
01:18:39.538 --> 01:18:41.586
Well, eventually they turned to the dregs.

2079
01:18:41.586 --> 01:18:44.445
And what's going on in Iraq right now,

2080
01:18:44.445 --> 01:18:46.898
is many of these men are literally criminals.

2081
01:18:46.898 --> 01:18:50.407
They're men who are given an option of jail

2082
01:18:50.407 --> 01:18:52.360
or military service to their nation.

2083
01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.772
And so you're talkin' about today, the U.S. military

2084
01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:57.820
is indeed, overwhelmingly men who would

2085
01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:58.950
otherwise be in prison.

2086
01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:03.110
And, you're not takin' would-be college kids.

2087
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:05.638
You're takin' a bunch of guys who are hard cases.

2088
01:19:05.638 --> 01:19:07.472
And you have the same--

2089
01:19:07.472 --> 01:19:08.656
<v Regina>And in some cases, kids who are just lost</v>

2090
01:19:08.656 --> 01:19:09.958
and have no idea what to do.

2091
01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:10.726
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

2092
01:19:10.726 --> 01:19:12.560
Now, I've made the example of Patrick Tillman.

2093
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.017
After 9-11, during the terrorist attacks of 9-11,

2094
01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:18.320
you get this wholesome, clean-cut golden boy

2095
01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.571
says, "I want to go out and serve my country.

2096
01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:22.106
"I want to go out and get back at the people

2097
01:19:22.106 --> 01:19:23.151
"who struck at us."

2098
01:19:23.151 --> 01:19:26.395
He becomes a U.S. Army Ranger, he's an Officer.

2099
01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:28.911
He winds up leadin' a bunch of these hard cases

2100
01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:31.023
into a charge in Afghanistan, and they frag him

2101
01:19:31.023 --> 01:19:32.570
right in the back at point blank range.

2102
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:33.711
What do you expect to happen?

2103
01:19:33.711 --> 01:19:35.620
This guy's got no knowledge of prison culture,

2104
01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.199
nor should he have knowledge of such.

2105
01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:39.332
And, but he's put into this environment.

2106
01:19:39.332 --> 01:19:40.697
He doesn't know what he's dealin' with,

2107
01:19:40.697 --> 01:19:41.956
and he pays the price.

2108
01:19:43.136 --> 01:19:45.956
And I'd hate to see other people coming from

2109
01:19:45.956 --> 01:19:48.675
that kind of background suffering that kind of fate.

2110
01:19:48.675 --> 01:19:51.299
And the U.S. Army did everything it could to cover it up.

2111
01:19:51.299 --> 01:19:54.360
And they've said, "Oh, it was an accident."

2112
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.501
Oh yeah, all this other stuff.

2113
01:19:55.501 --> 01:19:58.072
The guy's got M-16 rounds in him at point blank range,

2114
01:19:58.072 --> 01:19:59.981
according to the military coroner, himself.

2115
01:19:59.981 --> 01:20:02.232
And they first said it was enemy fire.

2116
01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:03.417
They first said all kinds of crap,

2117
01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:04.834
whatever they could do to hide it.

2118
01:20:06.274 --> 01:20:08.024
And this happens again and again.

2119
01:20:08.024 --> 01:20:10.509
It's not as bad as Vietnam, that we know of.

2120
01:20:10.509 --> 01:20:11.714
But what do we know?

2121
01:20:11.714 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Regina>Yeah, that's true, we don't know.</v>

2122
01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:15.148
<v ->And--
<v Regina>All the images are</v>

2123
01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:16.663
very well-groomed, coming out of there.

2124
01:20:16.663 --> 01:20:18.327
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Most of the people that</v>

2125
01:20:18.327 --> 01:20:20.097
cover the war aren't allowed anywhere near

2126
01:20:20.097 --> 01:20:21.771
those zones.
<v ->Yes.</v>

2127
01:20:21.771 --> 01:20:22.998
<v Regina>They stay in hotels.</v>

2128
01:20:22.998 --> 01:20:24.001
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

2129
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:25.622
And the reporters are embedded.

2130
01:20:25.622 --> 01:20:27.275
<v Regina>That's right, yeah.</v>
<v ->They're embedded journalists.</v>

2131
01:20:27.275 --> 01:20:30.496
And so when I'm emphasizing what's going on in the military

2132
01:20:30.496 --> 01:20:33.589
right now, in terms of the post-draft military,

2133
01:20:33.589 --> 01:20:35.936
you've had more and more of a prison-like culture.

2134
01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:39.765
And just like in prison, where you have White Supremacists,

2135
01:20:39.765 --> 01:20:43.786
they ethnically enclave, and you have Black Nationalists,

2136
01:20:43.786 --> 01:20:48.704
you have Latino Revanchists, part of La Raza.

2137
01:20:48.704 --> 01:20:51.860
And they go at ends with each other

2138
01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.556
based on ethnic enclaving.

2139
01:20:53.556 --> 01:20:56.927
And so, as an Asian, just like there's very few Asians

2140
01:20:56.927 --> 01:21:00.041
in prison, I was one of the few people in the military

2141
01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:01.013
who was Asian.

2142
01:21:01.013 --> 01:21:04.596
And, they're such a minority that statistically

2143
01:21:04.596 --> 01:21:07.027
they're not even really rateable

2144
01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:08.818
as being a component of the military.

2145
01:21:08.818 --> 01:21:11.997
But at least I was neutral to these gang fights.

2146
01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:12.925
And--

2147
01:21:12.925 --> 01:21:15.015
<v Regina>But you had your feet in both worlds, too.</v>

2148
01:21:15.015 --> 01:21:17.522
Although, were you still categorized as Asian,

2149
01:21:17.522 --> 01:21:19.122
or classified as Asian even though,

2150
01:21:19.122 --> 01:21:20.732
technically you're Eurasian?

2151
01:21:20.732 --> 01:21:22.791
<v ->Well, it's interes, it's an interesting point.</v>

2152
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:25.693
Certainly to Caucasians, I'm usually automatically

2153
01:21:25.693 --> 01:21:26.769
classified as Asian.

2154
01:21:26.769 --> 01:21:29.318
To Asians, I'm automatically classified as Caucasian.

2155
01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:32.518
And so, yeah, foot in both worlds,

2156
01:21:32.518 --> 01:21:34.013
but not really part of either one.

2157
01:21:34.013 --> 01:21:34.683
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:21:34.683 --> 01:21:37.147
<v ->But, which was, what has always given me</v>

2159
01:21:37.147 --> 01:21:38.587
the ability to speak the way I do,

2160
01:21:38.587 --> 01:21:40.347
because I've always had a sense of detachment.

2161
01:21:40.347 --> 01:21:41.296
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

2162
01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:43.664
And, and your mother, as I recall?

2163
01:21:43.664 --> 01:21:46.128
<v ->Oh, half ch, yeah, her father was Chinese</v>

2164
01:21:46.128 --> 01:21:47.355
and her mother was Japanese,

2165
01:21:47.355 --> 01:21:49.360
and she was born in Tokyo before World War Two.

2166
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.770
And it's part of why I try to emphasize to people,

2167
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:53.882
is that Japan has always been a multi-ethnic nation.

2168
01:21:53.882 --> 01:21:56.187
That doesn't contradict at all, what I said originally,

2169
01:21:56.187 --> 01:21:58.245
about them being a very familial nation.

2170
01:21:58.245 --> 01:22:00.527
But they've always had Chinese, and Okinawan,

2171
01:22:00.527 --> 01:22:02.244
and Taiwanese, and Korean minorities

2172
01:22:02.244 --> 01:22:03.407
within Japan.

2173
01:22:03.407 --> 01:22:06.490
Any culture that old is not gonna avoid that.

2174
01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:10.372
And, but her father was a Chinese man

2175
01:22:10.372 --> 01:22:11.833
who was respected enough by the Japanese.

2176
01:22:11.833 --> 01:22:13.508
That way they didn't mind him marrying

2177
01:22:13.508 --> 01:22:16.217
a Japanese woman in the capital city of their nation

2178
01:22:16.217 --> 01:22:17.402
before World War Two.

2179
01:22:17.402 --> 01:22:19.406
And, that was something I was going to bring up

2180
01:22:19.406 --> 01:22:21.486
about the swastika, to give people an example of that.

2181
01:22:21.486 --> 01:22:22.563
<v Regina>Yes, do, please.</v>

2182
01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.003
<v ->We were talking about these symbols.</v>

2183
01:22:24.003 --> 01:22:25.231
<v Regina>Yeah, off-camera, we were talking about it.</v>

2184
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:26.200
It's interesting.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

2185
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.784
Certainly, the swastika in Asia has none of the malevolence

2186
01:22:29.784 --> 01:22:32.120
attributed to it that it does in the west.

2187
01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.029
Because it is viewed as the heart

2188
01:22:34.029 --> 01:22:36.120
of the Bodhisattva Amitabha.

2189
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.120
It represents the centripetal or centrifugal direction

2190
01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:43.937
of forces, depending on which direction it's turned in.

2191
01:22:43.937 --> 01:22:45.911
When it's reversed into a different manner,

2192
01:22:45.911 --> 01:22:49.734
the way the Nazis used it, is known as a savastika, or...

2193
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:51.949
But that doesn't mean it's harnessing dark forces.

2194
01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:54.710
It just means it's harnessing a different direction of force.

2195
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:57.665
It's just as the pentagram, when it's just a star,

2196
01:22:57.665 --> 01:22:59.424
is harnessing cosmic energy,

2197
01:22:59.424 --> 01:23:01.558
and when it's inverted or pointing downward,

2198
01:23:01.558 --> 01:23:02.999
it's harnessing Earthly energy.

2199
01:23:02.999 --> 01:23:04.395
There's different forms of symbolism,

2200
01:23:04.395 --> 01:23:06.251
and the symbol itself is neutral,

2201
01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:08.416
but we imbue our,

2202
01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:10.474
we imbue our values on them.

2203
01:23:10.474 --> 01:23:13.034
And the more simplistic a symbol is,

2204
01:23:13.034 --> 01:23:16.170
the more it becomes a brand name,

2205
01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:18.186
or a brand symbol that iconographs

2206
01:23:18.186 --> 01:23:20.788
some kind of emotive response.

2207
01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:23.295
And to give you an example of how different

2208
01:23:24.685 --> 01:23:27.983
the situation is in Asia as opposed to the west,

2209
01:23:27.983 --> 01:23:31.215
the swastika was not only always there traditionally

2210
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:34.234
and also found on Asian military vehicles

2211
01:23:34.234 --> 01:23:36.527
or on Asian churches or temples.

2212
01:23:36.527 --> 01:23:40.783
And westerners see that, and they're just aghast,

2213
01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:42.618
and they say, "Oh, that's like some kind of

2214
01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:44.238
"negative temple, or church."

2215
01:23:44.238 --> 01:23:46.820
Or they take a look at the swastika

2216
01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:50.083
on Asian Military vehicles and they say, automatically,

2217
01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:51.075
"Nazi."

2218
01:23:51.075 --> 01:23:52.004
Comes up in their brain.

2219
01:23:52.004 --> 01:23:52.914
And...

2220
01:23:53.222 --> 01:23:55.770
But beyond that, the Nazi swastika itself,

2221
01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:59.259
that of Adolf Hitler, who was cultivating a alliance,

2222
01:23:59.259 --> 01:24:01.967
not only with Japan, but with Nationalist China,

2223
01:24:01.967 --> 01:24:05.636
unknown to the vast majority of academics,

2224
01:24:05.636 --> 01:24:07.289
let alone the late public.

2225
01:24:07.289 --> 01:24:10.255
Everyone has heard peripherally of the Afrika Korps,

2226
01:24:10.255 --> 01:24:12.741
but the Germans of the Third Reich had an Orient Corps,

2227
01:24:12.741 --> 01:24:15.556
and I certainly have many, many photographs

2228
01:24:15.556 --> 01:24:19.897
that I can put, that I can access to bring to the public eye

2229
01:24:19.897 --> 01:24:22.840
of many, many Chinese in Nazi uniform.

2230
01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.560
And that was the point, was that he had supplied

2231
01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.213
and trained, through the Orient Corps,

2232
01:24:27.213 --> 01:24:29.230
many of the Nationalist Chinese forces,

2233
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.480
and they were fighting against the Japanese

2234
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.038
wearing the German Stahlehlm,

2235
01:24:33.038 --> 01:24:36.408
and these German uniforms as the alliance

2236
01:24:36.408 --> 01:24:37.731
became more convoluted,

2237
01:24:37.731 --> 01:24:40.515
and Adolf Hitler was forced to choose sides in the alliance.

2238
01:24:40.515 --> 01:24:43.202
But during the period of the Nanjing Massacre,

2239
01:24:43.202 --> 01:24:45.506
when the Japanese really cut loose

2240
01:24:45.506 --> 01:24:48.289
and were massacring all of these people.

2241
01:24:50.539 --> 01:24:52.352
The man's name, I believe, was Stroop,

2242
01:24:52.352 --> 01:24:54.219
and there were several other Germans involved.

2243
01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:56.448
It was the entire German Embassy that was in China

2244
01:24:56.448 --> 01:24:58.645
who were die-hard members of the Nazi Party,

2245
01:24:58.645 --> 01:25:00.255
and they appealed to Adolf Hitler, they said,

2246
01:25:00.255 --> 01:25:03.178
"We need help in terms of sheltering as many people

2247
01:25:03.178 --> 01:25:05.802
"within the Shanghai refuge as we can."

2248
01:25:07.472 --> 01:25:08.832
And the Nanjing refuge, they were establishing.

2249
01:25:08.832 --> 01:25:11.531
There was a tremendous international community in Shanghai.

2250
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:13.707
There was a tremendous international community in Nanjing.

2251
01:25:13.707 --> 01:25:17.034
But they were establishing a refuge in Nanjing

2252
01:25:17.034 --> 01:25:19.125
for the people who were trying to escape the Japanese

2253
01:25:19.125 --> 01:25:20.650
massacre.

2254
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:23.434
And, so what Adolf Hitler sent them

2255
01:25:23.434 --> 01:25:24.906
was a one-ton flag.

2256
01:25:24.906 --> 01:25:27.338
Literally, it was a flag, a German swastika.

2257
01:25:27.338 --> 01:25:30.773
A Nazi hazenkruis, a hakenkruis means, "twisted cross"

2258
01:25:30.773 --> 01:25:32.959
or "hooked cross" which means the swastika.

2259
01:25:32.959 --> 01:25:35.861
And so he sent them a flag that was so massive

2260
01:25:35.861 --> 01:25:37.993
that it literally weighed one ton.

2261
01:25:37.993 --> 01:25:41.364
And so when he sent this to Nanjing,

2262
01:25:41.364 --> 01:25:43.731
the German Ambassador unfurled it over this,

2263
01:25:43.731 --> 01:25:45.470
he covered an entire section of the city.

2264
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:48.766
This huge, one-ton Nazi hakenkruis, or the swastika.

2265
01:25:48.766 --> 01:25:51.284
And the Japanese, of course, said,

2266
01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:52.884
"Well, we can't bomb that, we can't enter that,

2267
01:25:52.884 --> 01:25:54.152
"because that's a potential ally."

2268
01:25:54.152 --> 01:25:55.134
<v Regina>It's all, yeah.</v>

2269
01:25:55.134 --> 01:25:57.032
<v ->And so, what the Japanese did was they ignored</v>

2270
01:25:57.032 --> 01:25:59.400
all of the Chinese who managed to make it under that flag.

2271
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.053
So under the shelter of that flag,

2272
01:26:01.053 --> 01:26:03.025
the German Embassy set up all of these lamps

2273
01:26:03.025 --> 01:26:05.041
and electrical facilities, and medical facilities,

2274
01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:07.196
and medical cots, and they saved thousands and thousands

2275
01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:08.337
of Chinese people.

2276
01:26:08.337 --> 01:26:10.865
So to this day, the Chinese people look on

2277
01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:13.745
the Nazi swastika as a symbol of refuge.

2278
01:26:13.745 --> 01:26:15.451
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->And...</v>

2279
01:26:15.451 --> 01:26:17.274
<v Regina>It's amazing how these symbols</v>

2280
01:26:17.274 --> 01:26:18.555
are taken on by each culture.

2281
01:26:18.555 --> 01:26:20.109
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Depending on what our own</v>

2282
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:21.750
social lens is, at the time.

2283
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:23.190
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>That's fascinating.</v>

2284
01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:23.894
<v ->Right.</v>

2285
01:26:23.894 --> 01:26:24.886
Well, when I was in Kenya,

2286
01:26:24.886 --> 01:26:26.582
and I brought up the fact that I served as a mercenary

2287
01:26:26.582 --> 01:26:28.513
in Northeast Africa.

2288
01:26:28.513 --> 01:26:30.998
I went out, I brought that up in the presentation.

2289
01:26:30.998 --> 01:26:32.481
And I later went up into the Balkans,

2290
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:36.406
but when I was a mercenary in the Horn of Africa,

2291
01:26:36.406 --> 01:26:38.773
I just had to make a stop in Uganda,

2292
01:26:38.773 --> 01:26:40.512
'cause I had heard that...

2293
01:26:42.622 --> 01:26:45.420
in their capital city, Kampala, I believe it is.

2294
01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.763
It's been so long, I keep, you know, I'm getting

2295
01:26:46.763 --> 01:26:48.652
Kinshasa mixed up with Kampala now.

2296
01:26:48.652 --> 01:26:50.902
But in their capital city, I had understood,

2297
01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:54.848
that there was a huge statue of Adolf Hitler

2298
01:26:54.848 --> 01:26:56.725
that was built during the Idi Amin regime.

2299
01:26:56.725 --> 01:27:00.965
And, and of course, Uganda had been a British colony.

2300
01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:03.376
But it was next to, door to Kenya which was,

2301
01:27:03.376 --> 01:27:05.647
it bordered Kenya, which used to be a German colony.

2302
01:27:05.647 --> 01:27:08.880
But when I went up into Uganda, and into their capital city,

2303
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:11.863
I couldn't believe that it was still there.

2304
01:27:11.863 --> 01:27:13.440
And it was a huge statue of Adolf Hitler.

2305
01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.852
And when they found out my name was Dietrich,

2306
01:27:17.452 --> 01:27:18.550
my money was no good anymore.

2307
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:19.873
They just gave me everything for free.

2308
01:27:19.873 --> 01:27:20.854
(laughter)

2309
01:27:20.854 --> 01:27:23.243
And I said, "So why do you like Germans so much?"

2310
01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:25.451
And they said, "We love Germans because

2311
01:27:25.451 --> 01:27:28.332
"they are white people who eat white people."

2312
01:27:28.332 --> 01:27:32.672
And to many of these darker ethnicities,

2313
01:27:32.672 --> 01:27:34.763
when they look at the films of the concentration camps,

2314
01:27:34.763 --> 01:27:37.898
all they see are Gypsies, Jews, Slavs,

2315
01:27:37.898 --> 01:27:40.427
and various other white ethnicities,

2316
01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:41.792
but all they see are jet white faces.

2317
01:27:41.792 --> 01:27:43.094
You know, I mean bleach white faces.

2318
01:27:43.094 --> 01:27:43.903
<v Regina>Right.</v>

2319
01:27:43.903 --> 01:27:46.303
<v ->And, so when they see that, to them,</v>

2320
01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.340
the Germans are heroes.

2321
01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.762
They're an anti-colonial force of liberators.

2322
01:27:50.762 --> 01:27:55.167
And so they look on Adolf Hitler as this kind of avatar

2323
01:27:55.167 --> 01:27:57.769
of, of retributive justice.

2324
01:27:57.769 --> 01:27:59.038
You see, demons in Africa--

2325
01:27:59.038 --> 01:28:00.531
This is one thing I found out in Africa.

2326
01:28:00.531 --> 01:28:03.293
Demons are agents of retributive justice

2327
01:28:03.293 --> 01:28:04.456
in Africa.

2328
01:28:04.456 --> 01:28:06.749
And the African perspective of demonolatry,

2329
01:28:06.749 --> 01:28:08.627
and demonology, is much more different

2330
01:28:08.627 --> 01:28:09.906
than what we have here.

2331
01:28:09.906 --> 01:28:12.114
And so, a demon can be your friend

2332
01:28:12.114 --> 01:28:13.804
if you learn to...

2333
01:28:15.762 --> 01:28:18.173
To be cautious in (laughs) its presence.

2334
01:28:18.173 --> 01:28:21.351
<v Regina>Is that like the Jin, for example?</v>

2335
01:28:21.351 --> 01:28:22.652
<v ->Yes, yeah.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

2336
01:28:22.652 --> 01:28:25.000
<v ->The traditional view of the Jin in (mumbles)--</v>

2337
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.375
<v Regina>They can be your friend or your enemy.</v>

2338
01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:27.975
<v ->That is correct, that is correct.</v>

2339
01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:29.969
That would be the view in Africa.

2340
01:28:29.969 --> 01:28:32.448
And so, in...

2341
01:28:32.828 --> 01:28:36.443
That is how they view the Nazis, as white agents

2342
01:28:36.443 --> 01:28:38.235
of retributive justice.

2343
01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:40.091
Now, if you remember the Afrika Korps,

2344
01:28:40.091 --> 01:28:42.203
there was never any massacres or atrocities

2345
01:28:42.203 --> 01:28:43.696
against any black population.

2346
01:28:43.696 --> 01:28:45.574
They were in Northern Africa, and there was certainly

2347
01:28:45.574 --> 01:28:48.592
this view, again, of the Arab population of them

2348
01:28:48.592 --> 01:28:49.403
as liberators.

2349
01:28:49.403 --> 01:28:53.189
So you have this, this totally different perspective

2350
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:54.417
on that entire phenomenon.

2351
01:28:54.417 --> 01:28:56.272
But believe it or not, in the vast majority

2352
01:28:56.272 --> 01:28:59.151
of Latin America, Africa, and Asia,

2353
01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:00.869
the Nazis are the good guys.

2354
01:29:00.869 --> 01:29:02.031
<v Regina>Hmm.</v>

2355
01:29:02.031 --> 01:29:04.058
<v ->And that's, that's basically the rest of the world.</v>

2356
01:29:04.058 --> 01:29:05.285
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah, yeah (laughs)</v>

2357
01:29:05.285 --> 01:29:07.024
<v ->That's, that's basically any, anything outside</v>

2358
01:29:07.024 --> 01:29:07.930
of the white world.

2359
01:29:07.930 --> 01:29:10.095
So, and that was my experience everywhere.

2360
01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.112
And my name, Dietrich, served me in good stead

2361
01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:14.501
wherever I was in the rest of the world,

2362
01:29:14.501 --> 01:29:15.450
in that regard.

2363
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.886
<v Regina>This is absolutely fascinating, and...</v>

2364
01:29:18.863 --> 01:29:20.857
Well, we normally only go an hour,

2365
01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:23.140
but you have so much to say.

2366
01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.899
We've gone over our time a little bit,

2367
01:29:24.899 --> 01:29:26.874
but is there anything else in conclusion,

2368
01:29:26.874 --> 01:29:29.103
on this sub, that you'd like to share with us

2369
01:29:29.103 --> 01:29:30.446
before we say goodbye?

2370
01:29:31.496 --> 01:29:32.887
<v ->Yes, I'd like to say that</v>

2371
01:29:33.537 --> 01:29:37.242
our paradigms are going to be undergoing a massive shift

2372
01:29:37.242 --> 01:29:39.838
within the next few years.

2373
01:29:40.122 --> 01:29:42.547
Certainly, the next few decades will be apocalyptic.

2374
01:29:42.547 --> 01:29:44.628
And certainly what someone like Colonel Aquino

2375
01:29:44.628 --> 01:29:48.713
is hoping for, is that the ideology of Satanicism

2376
01:29:48.713 --> 01:29:50.708
will become a major religion.

2377
01:29:50.708 --> 01:29:54.846
And he hopes to use the military as an agent

2378
01:29:54.846 --> 01:29:56.511
in disseminating this religion.

2379
01:29:57.791 --> 01:30:00.552
Now, what we're faced with is also Islamicism,

2380
01:30:00.552 --> 01:30:03.709
and we have to view Islamicism as an ideology,

2381
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:07.687
as opposed to the religious or spiritual devotion of Islam.

2382
01:30:07.687 --> 01:30:12.687
And we have major new religions that are on the scene

2383
01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.719
right now, and what this heralds is a new dark age.

2384
01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:18.364
See, in the original dark age of the Middle Ages,

2385
01:30:18.364 --> 01:30:21.106
there was no such thing as politics.

2386
01:30:21.106 --> 01:30:23.377
A man's religion was his politics.

2387
01:30:23.377 --> 01:30:27.857
You lived or died by being a Christian, or a Muslim.

2388
01:30:27.857 --> 01:30:29.318
There was no such thing as Europe.

2389
01:30:29.318 --> 01:30:31.910
In the Middle Ages, the closest concept that we had

2390
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:33.744
to Europe was Christendom.

2391
01:30:34.874 --> 01:30:38.465
And, so what we have now is an entirely secular Europe

2392
01:30:38.465 --> 01:30:42.273
that is wide open to the Islamicist wave

2393
01:30:42.273 --> 01:30:45.762
of immigration and ideology.

2394
01:30:45.762 --> 01:30:49.259
And what we have in America are the new religions,

2395
01:30:49.259 --> 01:30:50.891
such as Satanicism.

2396
01:30:50.891 --> 01:30:53.025
So we are entering a new dark age,

2397
01:30:53.025 --> 01:30:54.582
where people are living and dying

2398
01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:57.856
by these new, idealized

2399
01:30:57.856 --> 01:31:00.780
or ideologically indoctrinated

2400
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.799
religious paradigms.

2401
01:31:03.382 --> 01:31:06.858
And, it will, we will have to contend with

2402
01:31:06.858 --> 01:31:10.026
which ideologies will prevail in this dark age,

2403
01:31:10.026 --> 01:31:11.482
and what we want to prevail.

2404
01:31:11.711 --> 01:31:12.758
And we have to make that choice now.

2405
01:31:12.758 --> 01:31:14.335
What is it that we want to prevail?

2406
01:31:15.825 --> 01:31:18.592
So that we can struggle for,

2407
01:31:18.592 --> 01:31:23.592
for the ultimate victory or survival of that paradigm.

2408
01:31:23.818 --> 01:31:27.018
And certainly, Carl Sagan was very worried about this

2409
01:31:27.018 --> 01:31:28.830
in the sense that he's last book,

2410
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:31.177
his last book was The Demon-Haunted World.

2411
01:31:31.177 --> 01:31:33.342
And he felt that we were entering a world--

2412
01:31:33.342 --> 01:31:35.316
And he didn't believe in demons.

2413
01:31:35.316 --> 01:31:37.491
But he was, he felt that we were entering a world

2414
01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:41.117
of new age mysticism, which threatened rational science.

2415
01:31:41.117 --> 01:31:43.294
And he felt that we were entering a world where

2416
01:31:43.294 --> 01:31:45.716
people who believed in channeling, and mysticism

2417
01:31:45.716 --> 01:31:48.104
and alien abduction, and the faerie folk,

2418
01:31:48.104 --> 01:31:50.153
and in the new age phenomena was threatening

2419
01:31:50.153 --> 01:31:53.000
rationalism, and leading to a new dark age

2420
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.720
of mystical belief and manipulation.

2421
01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.991
Well, I say we're entering a new dark age

2422
01:31:59.091 --> 01:32:00.196
where the demons are real.

2423
01:32:00.196 --> 01:32:01.262
<v Regina>Mhmm.</v>

2424
01:32:01.262 --> 01:32:04.580
<v ->And once you acknowledge that, and contend with it,</v>

2425
01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.992
then...

2426
01:32:08.046 --> 01:32:09.667
Then we're entering a dark age that's very similar

2427
01:32:09.667 --> 01:32:10.639
to our last,

2428
01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:13.475
in which, certainly, demons were believed to be real,

2429
01:32:13.475 --> 01:32:17.124
and people relied on the church to,

2430
01:32:18.064 --> 01:32:19.289
to rebuke them.

2431
01:32:19.289 --> 01:32:21.818
But now there is no church.

2432
01:32:21.818 --> 01:32:23.609
That's one thing America does not have.

2433
01:32:23.609 --> 01:32:25.230
America does not have what Europe had.

2434
01:32:25.230 --> 01:32:27.640
What Europe had was The Church.

2435
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.969
And America does not have that.

2436
01:32:30.969 --> 01:32:32.269
<v Regina>Although there does seem to be a rise</v>

2437
01:32:32.269 --> 01:32:33.933
at this moment, in Christianity as well.

2438
01:32:33.933 --> 01:32:35.171
<v ->Evangelical.</v>

2439
01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:37.165
<v Regina>Evangelical Christianity, that's right.</v>

2440
01:32:37.165 --> 01:32:39.491
<v ->But the church is so much more dispersed in that sense.</v>

2441
01:32:39.491 --> 01:32:42.786
It's not like a formalized spiritual army.

2442
01:32:42.786 --> 01:32:44.919
They considered themselves militant,

2443
01:32:44.919 --> 01:32:46.637
they're like crusaders in a sense,

2444
01:32:46.637 --> 01:32:47.458
they're like...

2445
01:32:48.078 --> 01:32:52.611
But are they willing to put on armor and heft up the sword?

2446
01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.949
Now that's what they did in the Middle Ages,

2447
01:32:55.949 --> 01:32:57.943
because they were involved in a defensive war

2448
01:32:57.943 --> 01:32:58.983
against Islam.

2449
01:32:59.586 --> 01:33:01.868
And in the middle ages, the Pope would go out

2450
01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.308
and not only consecrate armies,

2451
01:33:03.308 --> 01:33:04.550
he would lead them.

2452
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.300
Now, are we in a, what do we have?

2453
01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:10.337
We have military forces that are now Satanic.

2454
01:33:12.807 --> 01:33:13.800
<v Regina>So.</v>

2455
01:33:15.053 --> 01:33:17.213
How would you frame it

2456
01:33:17.987 --> 01:33:21.260
for any kind of personal sense of empowerment

2457
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.438
in this situation?

2458
01:33:23.394 --> 01:33:24.673
<v ->I would--
<v Regina>Anybody watching this?</v>

2459
01:33:24.673 --> 01:33:26.192
<v ->I would say that</v>

2460
01:33:27.341 --> 01:33:29.639
what a person needs to contend with is...

2461
01:33:32.801 --> 01:33:36.076
We are facing a situation where, I think that people

2462
01:33:36.076 --> 01:33:40.832
need to recognize that there are new paradigms

2463
01:33:40.832 --> 01:33:43.909
that are going to change reality as we know it.

2464
01:33:44.523 --> 01:33:46.817
And that they adapt to that, and decide

2465
01:33:46.817 --> 01:33:49.557
if they want some concept of reality that they value

2466
01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:54.557
to prevail, then they had best be ready to organize

2467
01:33:54.687 --> 01:33:56.063
as a community

2468
01:33:56.063 --> 01:34:01.063
to survive the waves of violence that will be perpetrated

2469
01:34:01.152 --> 01:34:06.152
by violent, fanatical religions,

2470
01:34:06.185 --> 01:34:08.970
such as Islamicism and Satanicism,

2471
01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:10.499
that will be...

2472
01:34:11.753 --> 01:34:13.773
They had better be ready to defend themselves.

2473
01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.682
<v Regina>(inhales deeply) And on that note,</v>

2474
01:34:16.682 --> 01:34:19.420
(clears throat) I've certainly interviewed people that are,

2475
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.546
have looked at this from other kind of cyclical

2476
01:34:22.546 --> 01:34:23.847
points of view,

2477
01:34:23.847 --> 01:34:26.407
and we are in a period of the breaking down of the old

2478
01:34:26.407 --> 01:34:27.911
in every way.

2479
01:34:27.911 --> 01:34:30.588
And certainly, this would appear to be part of that decay.

2480
01:34:30.588 --> 01:34:32.093
<v ->Yeah, yeah.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

2481
01:34:32.093 --> 01:34:34.876
So we just need to have knowledge, and then make our choice.

2482
01:34:34.876 --> 01:34:37.201
<v ->Well I, I, I'm very optimistic, to tell you the truth.</v>

2483
01:34:37.201 --> 01:34:40.060
I feel that unlike--

2484
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.406
Well, having worked for the federal government,

2485
01:34:42.406 --> 01:34:44.358
I can tell you for a fact that if anything happens,

2486
01:34:44.358 --> 01:34:45.755
it gets done by accident.

2487
01:34:45.755 --> 01:34:47.397
Conspiracies do occur,

2488
01:34:47.397 --> 01:34:50.236
but the only reason conspiracies such as those

2489
01:34:50.236 --> 01:34:53.114
that are orchestrated by an intelligent and dedicated man

2490
01:34:53.114 --> 01:34:54.896
like Colonel Aquino can succeed,

2491
01:34:54.896 --> 01:34:57.519
is because everyone else in his community,

2492
01:34:57.519 --> 01:34:58.586
the government surrounding him,

2493
01:34:58.586 --> 01:35:00.954
is so apathetic, so corrupt, so incompetent,

2494
01:35:00.954 --> 01:35:05.954
so stupid, so lackadaisical, and ultimately so deserving

2495
01:35:06.116 --> 01:35:08.601
of whatever happens to them,

2496
01:35:08.601 --> 01:35:11.129
that that's how a man like him gets away with it.

2497
01:35:11.129 --> 01:35:12.942
That's half the battle, right there.

2498
01:35:12.942 --> 01:35:14.746
When you've got cooperation from the enemy--

2499
01:35:14.746 --> 01:35:15.749
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

2500
01:35:15.749 --> 01:35:16.633
<v ->Yeah, what more can you--</v>

2501
01:35:16.633 --> 01:35:17.934
<v Regina>So we need to be informed, we need to</v>

2502
01:35:17.934 --> 01:35:18.809
make our choices.

2503
01:35:18.809 --> 01:35:20.025
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Take care of our,</v>

2504
01:35:20.025 --> 01:35:22.671
not only our own beings, and our own hearts,

2505
01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:25.411
and our own spirit, but also extend that out to community.

2506
01:35:25.411 --> 01:35:26.819
And join together.

2507
01:35:26.819 --> 01:35:27.523
<v ->Yes.</v>

2508
01:35:27.523 --> 01:35:28.376
<v Regina>Sounds like that's what you're saying.</v>

2509
01:35:28.376 --> 01:35:29.497
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Yes, very good.</v>

2510
01:35:29.497 --> 01:35:30.285
<v ->That's wonderful.</v>

2511
01:35:30.285 --> 01:35:31.192
I couldn't have gotten that out without you.

2512
01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.259
(laughter)

2513
01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.113
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>
