00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:01.989
<v ->James Gilliland has been trying to take</v>

2
00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:05.929
the giggle factor out of the subject of UFOs for many years.

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.333
After a near-death experience as a teenager,

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.587
James was shown some truths that resonated so deeply

5
00:00:11.587 --> 00:00:14.053
he was not able to turn his back on them.

6
00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:17.192
This inspired a deep search for our interconnectedness

7
00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:19.072
with beings throughout the cosmos.

8
00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.938
Today, people visit his ranch from around the world

9
00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.305
to manifest UFO visitation,

10
00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.693
and indeed they do, as his astounding home videos show.

11
00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.252
Sometimes it's the most innocent among them

12
00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:32.802
that draws them in.

13
00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:37.802 line:15% 
(soft outer space music)

14
00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Voiceover>So James, after years and years of contact</v>

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.152
both on an internal inter-dimensional level, through a lot

16
00:00:46.152 --> 00:00:49.356
of meditation and also by the spectacular types

17
00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:51.924
that have been documented on film,

18
00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:53.629
these ships are showing up on your property,

19
00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.746
and I have been there and personally seen this.

20
00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:57.522
I think the last time I was there,

21
00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:58.472
what four or five years ago?

22
00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.198
<v ->Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:01.264
<v Voiceover>And so we've already set it up,</v>

24
00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:02.264
you're the real deal, so.

25
00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:04.171
<v ->Okay (laughing)</v>

26
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about</v>

27
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.029
the really important aspect,

28
00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:11.412
which is why are they appearing in droves now,

29
00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:15.580
in your film, the incredible film, that footage over Mexico,

30
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.877
for example,
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

31
00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.411
<v Voiceover>- Mexico City. Unbelievable.</v>

32
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.385
Hundreds of UFOs.

33
00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:21.924
So, why are they showing up now?

34
00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:23.625
What is the information you're getting,

35
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.758
and let's talk about what it is we're not getting.

36
00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:28.733
<v ->Yeah, there's a lot of things</v>

37
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.383
that's part of Earth's destiny

38
00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:32.040
to join the rest of the universe,

39
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.056
and so we're gonna be joining a greater family of man,

40
00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:38.555
and I would rather refer to them

41
00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:41.948
as our brothers and sisters on high, you might say,

42
00:01:41.948 --> 00:01:44.981
and a lot of them are just us that have left

43
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:48.090
during cataclysms and they went back out into the stars,

44
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.438
into the heavens, and now they're returning.

45
00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:54.666
And we're getting in that same process right now.

46
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.196
We're gettin' ready to move into some major shifts,

47
00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.388
you know, these great shifts of consciousness

48
00:01:59.388 --> 00:02:00.653
and energy and change,

49
00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.563
and they're coming here to help us with that shift.

50
00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:06.038
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm, and it seems</v>

51
00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:07.898
that a number of different speakers

52
00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.387
at this particular conference in Mount Shasta,

53
00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:12.281
but also elsewhere,

54
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.753
another one I did recently,

55
00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:18.061
keep referring to beings from the Pleiades, or Pleiades,

56
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:21.456
and in the case of Billy Meier, the Plejares, Plejarens.

57
00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:22.301
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

58
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:23.651
<v Voiceover>You know, everybody</v>

59
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:24.709
has their squabbles within that.

60
00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.470
<v ->(laughing)</v>

61
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Voiceover>Nonetheless,</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.276
<v Voiceover>over a very long period of time now,</v>

63
00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:29.442
these beings have been coming

64
00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:30.249
and contacting.

65
00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:30.955
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

66
00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:32.514
<v Voiceover>apparently people all over the world,</v>

67
00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:35.353
and including yourself.

68
00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:37.747
Can you talk about these particular beings

69
00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:39.064
because they're very human.

70
00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.130
<v ->Yeah, they're basically our ancestors.</v>

71
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.678
They, some of the most ancient beings came from Lyra,

72
00:02:45.678 --> 00:02:48.202
and then they went from Lyra to the Pleiades

73
00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:49.703
and the Hades and the Orion system

74
00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.161
and from there, they went to Mars,

75
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.993
Malona, and then the Earth,

76
00:02:54.993 --> 00:02:57.259
and those were all ancient colonies of these,

77
00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:59.518
of the same base group,

78
00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:02.152
and when they started these colonies,

79
00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:04.108
after awhile, they started drawing off of

80
00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:06.267
other star nations, as well,

81
00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:09.147
so we're just a big composite, you might say,

82
00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:13.233
of galactic genetics on the Earth,

83
00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.624
and our ancient history goes back over 28 million years,

84
00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:18.925
not just 6,000 years,

85
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:22.399
and they're finding, you know, artifacts and diodes

86
00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.421
and things in coal that are 50 million years old,

87
00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:29.247
so it shows very clearly the Earth

88
00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:31.404
has been visited and colonized

89
00:03:31.404 --> 00:03:34.366
for well over 50 million years that we know of,

90
00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:37.438
according to Cremo, Michael Cremo,

91
00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:38.956
and some of the other people

92
00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:40.368
in the Forbidden Archaeology,

93
00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:42.843
but when anything doesn't fit within the box,

94
00:03:42.843 --> 00:03:44.450
you know, they shove it in the basement

95
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.626
and say it didn't happen or it didn't exist

96
00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:50.360
to keep the old program going, but.

97
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.122
<v Voiceover>I'd like to kind of give</v>

98
00:03:53.122 --> 00:03:54.931
a framework for a lot of this.

99
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:59.056
In the book you wrote that was given through your guide,

100
00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:03.603
Cazekiel, which I read a number of years ago,

101
00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:08.603
I particularly related to that story of how this,

102
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.142
this peopling of this planet came together

103
00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:15.551
because it also happens to be almost identical

104
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.058
to what I had learned from another source

105
00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:18.301
that's very dear to me.

106
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:21.559
And so, if you would like to share a bit of that story,

107
00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:22.806
I know we hadn't intended to do that,

108
00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:23.577
<v ->Yeah</v>

109
00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:25.282
<v Voiceover>but it really kind of starts,</v>

110
00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:27.731
it really sets the framework for where we are today,

111
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:29.945
so can you hop through your first book a little bit

112
00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:31.158
and talk about this?

113
00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:32.404
<v ->It's almost like another life</v>

114
00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:34.204
I wrote that so long ago.
<v Voiceover>I know</v>

115
00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:35.896
and maybe just,

116
00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.778
do you think we should just leave that?

117
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.848
What do you want to do about that?

118
00:04:38.848 --> 00:04:39.837
<v ->I can talk a little bit about it.</v>

119
00:04:39.837 --> 00:04:40.654
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about it</v>

120
00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:41.900
because everyone has a version

121
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.787
of how it happened,
<v ->Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:44.147
<v Voiceover>and it's, we weren't just colonized</v>

123
00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:45.926
by people who turned us into slaves.

124
00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.109
<v ->Yeah, well the first book covers</v>

125
00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.859
all of the ancient history.

126
00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:52.258
It goes back to when the Earth was actually formed

127
00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.975
and how it was formed and everything else,

128
00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:55.467
and then it goes on,

129
00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.810
and it talks about how the different kingdoms

130
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.650
each built off of each other,

131
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.711
like the Mineral Kingdom.

132
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:03.066
You know, the Plant Kingdom built off of that,

133
00:05:03.066 --> 00:05:05.339
and then the Animal Kingdom built off

134
00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.688
the Plant Kingdom and then so on,

135
00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:09.771
and when it reached a certain level,

136
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:14.603
it was ready for humanity to walk on the Earth,

137
00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:17.326
and there's so much history in that.

138
00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.735
It's, there's no one story.

139
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:20.710
That's the whole problem.

140
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.429
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

141
00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:23.339
<v ->If you take all the stories and put them together,</v>

142
00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.739
you'll have more of the truth of the real history

143
00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:26.676
<v Voiceover>I think you're right.</v>

144
00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:27.659
<v ->of the planet,</v>

145
00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.225
so there was very, very ancient colonies here.

146
00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:34.199
There was some major cataclysms that hit.

147
00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.388
Another group came in again,

148
00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:38.940
about 430,000 years ago,

149
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.513
which are the Annunaki that they talk about,

150
00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:43.606
and they started things up again.

151
00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:45.879
Then more cataclysms came,

152
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.722
and then everybody had to start over again,

153
00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.538
so we've been starting over as primitives

154
00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:53.082
over and over and over due to natural cataclysms and cycles,

155
00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:56.420
great cycles, as well as technology run amuck.

156
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.544
<v Voiceover>Right, the famed (mumbles) times.</v>

157
00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:01.377
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>to themselves</v>

158
00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:03.193
<v ->Atlantis and Lamiri or (mumbles)</v>

159
00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:05.801
Those were all colonies that one of them

160
00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:08.943
misused technology and abused their power,

161
00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:10.384
and then they took down

162
00:06:10.384 --> 00:06:13.011
the rest of the civilization on the planet.

163
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:14.042
<v Voiceover>So is it fair to say, really,</v>

164
00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:16.224
if you're looking at the human species,

165
00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:19.811
it's sort of like San Francisco in the 1940s,

166
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:21.851
nobody's really from there.
<v ->(laughs)</v>

167
00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:25.053
<v Voiceover>Is it fair to say no one's really from here?</v>

168
00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:28.512
<v ->Yeah, everybody's trying to claim Earth as their home.</v>

169
00:06:28.512 --> 00:06:30.628
You know, but even the ancient traditions

170
00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:33.561
in the Cherokee Nation, which I'm part of,

171
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:36.184
the point to the Pleiades as their ancestors,

172
00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:39.277
so in all the ancient traditions,

173
00:06:39.277 --> 00:06:42.259
they, different nations, over in,

174
00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.775
all these other islands as well,

175
00:06:43.775 --> 00:06:45.599
they point at the Pleiades and say,

176
00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.989
we came from there or at different star systems,

177
00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:50.299
they point at and say this is where,

178
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:52.265
this is where our culture came from, so

179
00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:54.421
<v Voiceover>Africa, South America.</v>

180
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:55.048
<v ->Exactly.</v>

181
00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.082
<v Voiceover>They're representative,</v>

182
00:06:56.082 --> 00:07:00.072
original peoples in New Zealand, Australia,

183
00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:01.905
everybody's pointing out to the stars,

184
00:07:01.905 --> 00:07:02.836
<v ->Exactly.</v>

185
00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:06.737
<v Voiceover>and certainly the petroglyphs and pictographs</v>

186
00:07:06.737 --> 00:07:07.529
and so forth.

187
00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:09.068
<v ->Well, those ancient temples as well.</v>

188
00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:11.560
You know, when you go to the Indigenous people

189
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.585
and you say who built these?

190
00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:14.985
They point to the stars, and they say the gods or the,

191
00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:17.448
you know, they came from the stars,

192
00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:19.540
so this has been going on

193
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.156
for millions and millions of years,

194
00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:23.126
not just 6,000 years,

195
00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:25.371
and the Pleiades are very well known

196
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:27.262
in almost every culture,

197
00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:29.075
even in the Bible they mention the Pleiades.

198
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:32.135
They talk about the sweet energies of the Pleiades

199
00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:34.630
in Amos and Job, so it's,

200
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.625
the Pleiades system is very well known

201
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.783
as one of our ancient ancestors.

202
00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:43.958
<v Voiceover>So they're back, and they're coming,</v>

203
00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.716
and they're showing themselves by way of ships,

204
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:46.608
by way of orbs.

205
00:07:46.608 --> 00:07:49.965
They're talking to people inter-dimensionally

206
00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:53.699
They talk to you, so let's now get on with,

207
00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:54.826
we're all here together.

208
00:07:54.826 --> 00:07:57.534
Everything's going to be changing rather significantly.

209
00:07:57.534 --> 00:08:00.283
Let's talk about some of the changes, as you know them,

210
00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:02.764
right now, not, not even five years ago.

211
00:08:02.764 --> 00:08:05.645
Where are we right now, and where are we headed soon?

212
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:07.922
<v ->A lot of what they're talking about is the,</v>

213
00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:12.195
they're talking about change on every level,

214
00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:13.539
and they said that we have to get

215
00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:14.855
our consciousness in order.

216
00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:16.405
We have to get our environment in order.

217
00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:18.795
We have to rise to the occasion,

218
00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:20.553
and there's some huge shifts coming in

219
00:08:20.553 --> 00:08:22.522
of consciousness and energy,

220
00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:24.962
which are actually gonna create physical changes, as well,

221
00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:29.252
and a lot of it has to do with, kind of, you know,

222
00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.159
a grander cycle.

223
00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:33.774
You know, just like we have normal cycles on the planet,

224
00:08:33.774 --> 00:08:35.939
like fall, winter, summer, spring,

225
00:08:35.939 --> 00:08:37.633
there's grander cycles happening.

226
00:08:37.633 --> 00:08:39.308
We're in this grand cycle,

227
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:42.488
and this whole solar system is moving to a new place

228
00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:43.493
in the universe.

229
00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:44.590
It's moving through this area.

230
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.524
The leading edge of the solar system's glowing.

231
00:08:47.524 --> 00:08:48.774
It's a thousand times brighter.

232
00:08:48.774 --> 00:08:52.148
The planets are four times brighter right now.

233
00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:53.423
The sun is reacting to this

234
00:08:53.423 --> 00:08:55.500
with coronal mass ejections and solar flares,

235
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.238
so as we move through this cycle,

236
00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.038
it creates changes,

237
00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:03.037
and the way it does it is the consciousness and energy,

238
00:09:03.037 --> 00:09:05.490
there's more conscious and energy in this area

239
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.928
that we're moving through,

240
00:09:06.928 --> 00:09:08.720
and, you know, like a solar flare,

241
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.516
when it hits, it actually hits your bioelectric fields

242
00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:12.917
around the body,

243
00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:14.593
and it raises the frequencies,

244
00:09:14.593 --> 00:09:17.768
and any low vibrational frequency you're carrying,

245
00:09:17.768 --> 00:09:20.559
like old wounds, traumas, raw conclusions,

246
00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.117
gets agitated, and people get really agitated,

247
00:09:23.117 --> 00:09:25.517
so there's a lot of processing goin' on,

248
00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:27.731
a lot of projection, blame, and things like that

249
00:09:27.731 --> 00:09:29.684
when these energies hit,

250
00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:31.833
and then it moves through the other levels,

251
00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:34.372
and it creates weather changes, you know,

252
00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:37.065
severe weather, increase in hurricanes, tornadoes,

253
00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:39.006
that type of thing,

254
00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:40.981
and then as it moves through the denser levels,

255
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:45.208
it creates an increase in earthquake and volcanic activity,

256
00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:47.540
so as these shifts come through

257
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.962
as we move into this new place

258
00:09:48.962 --> 00:09:52.663
where there's a lot more energy involved and light,

259
00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:53.420
it's changing.

260
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.077
It's creating change all the way down through the continuum,

261
00:09:57.077 --> 00:09:59.125
the vibration continuum, you might say.

262
00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:00.365
<v Voiceover>Certainly as indicated</v>

263
00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:03.272
by the various conflicts going on at this period of time,

264
00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:05.815
the reptilian brain seems to be alive and well

265
00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:08.008
with those in power,

266
00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:10.141
and so, what are we looking at

267
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:13.680
in terms of the evolution away from that as a species even?

268
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.213
<v ->What's happening is there's a grid</v>

269
00:10:16.213 --> 00:10:19.822
that this reptilian consciousness is connected into,

270
00:10:19.822 --> 00:10:21.638
and just like we have the reptilian mind

271
00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:23.072
and the mammal mind,

272
00:10:23.072 --> 00:10:25.445
like I was saying before, the reptilian consciousness

273
00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:28.081
is just focused on me and power and greed and,

274
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:32.219
and the mammal mind is more cooperation, harmony,

275
00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:34.435
and working together, more family oriented,

276
00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:38.151
and so what's happening right now is that that old grid,

277
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:40.200
that old consciousness is being torn down.

278
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.135
It's being disassembled, you might say,

279
00:10:43.135 --> 00:10:45.882
and a whole new grid is being put in its place,

280
00:10:45.882 --> 00:10:48.667
which is more supportive of the living in harmony

281
00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:50.198
with each other and the planet

282
00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:51.889
and cooperating and working together,

283
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:56.653
and you'll see the old guard, you might say,

284
00:10:56.653 --> 00:10:59.476
collapsing in on itself, falling apart.

285
00:10:59.476 --> 00:11:02.856
They're becoming very dysfunctional.

286
00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:03.923
They can't even operate

287
00:11:03.923 --> 00:11:06.514
because they don't have a grid to pull from anymore.

288
00:11:06.514 --> 00:11:08.863
They don't have that support system.

289
00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:10.287
It's being torn down.

290
00:11:10.287 --> 00:11:15.287
<v Voiceover>So, to gain more severe types of control</v>

291
00:11:16.387 --> 00:11:20.042
is really essential for that, the final throes of survival

292
00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:23.308
from the, what science would call,

293
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:26.331
the reptilian aspect of the human brain?

294
00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:29.544
<v ->Yeah, there's other levels involved.</v>

295
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.195
I mean, there's other levels of consciousness involved.

296
00:11:32.195 --> 00:11:33.340
<v Voiceover>Please go into that, yes.</v>

297
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.771
<v ->Yeah and there's other beings involved</v>

298
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:37.585
and some seen and unseen beings

299
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:40.026
that are actually feeding this negativity,

300
00:11:40.026 --> 00:11:42.569
and those are being eliminated right now, as well,

301
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:45.372
so the support on every level is being taken out,

302
00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.049
and, you know, it's our destiny really

303
00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:49.851
to live in peace and harmony

304
00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:51.685
with each other and restore the Earth

305
00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:53.160
and join the rest of the universe,

306
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.357
and that's where we're going.

307
00:11:55.357 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Voiceover>And one of the ways we're adjusting</v>

308
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.882
our own physical capabilities of going through this time,

309
00:12:00.882 --> 00:12:03.939
to my understanding, is through some pretty incredible,

310
00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:06.959
through water, through the fluids of the body

311
00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.596
and the planet, and some of it,

312
00:12:08.596 --> 00:12:10.830
and I know you've been involved for a few years now

313
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.221
in a particular water technology,

314
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:12.999
<v ->Yes.</v>

315
00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:14.463
<v Voiceover>and others are involved in</v>

316
00:12:14.463 --> 00:12:17.168
similar and other types of water technologies.

317
00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.470
What is it with the proliferation

318
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.466
of all of these water technologies right now?

319
00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:23.534
<v ->Well, I'm seeing over and over,</v>

320
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:24.586
it's like, you know,

321
00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:27.852
these trees that we're lookin' at right now are 90% water.

322
00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:29.563
You know, I don't even know what percentage we are.

323
00:12:29.563 --> 00:12:32.017
I can't remember what, we're a very high percentage.

324
00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.850
I think it's high 70s or so, water,

325
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.140
depends on, depends on how hydrated you are,

326
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.219
so water is really the key.

327
00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:40.647
It's the key of life,

328
00:12:40.647 --> 00:12:43.555
and what we're doin' to the waters right now

329
00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:46.616
is very sad because most tap water

330
00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:51.157
has 6 to 800 chemicals

331
00:12:51.157 --> 00:12:53.424
and biologicals and things in them that,

332
00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:54.574
it's very toxic,

333
00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:57.840
and I've seen, you know,

334
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.789
everything there from just diesel and gas to plutonium,

335
00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:03.755
you know, in some water supplies, so

336
00:13:03.755 --> 00:13:06.149
and lead and everything else and arsenic and

337
00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:07.913
<v Voiceover>Uranium.</v>
<v ->Yeah, uranium</v>

338
00:13:07.913 --> 00:13:08.882
<v Voiceover>in really bad supplies.</v>

339
00:13:08.882 --> 00:13:09.837
<v ->Yeah, you name it.</v>

340
00:13:09.837 --> 00:13:12.507
It's everywhere, so we're really screwing things up

341
00:13:12.507 --> 00:13:14.028
as far as the water system,

342
00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:17.144
so it's very important that we clean our system up

343
00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:19.694
and put the very pure water in.

344
00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:22.586
<v Voiceover>What about some of the,</v>

345
00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:23.267
oh I'm sorry, go ahead.

346
00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:25.334
<v ->Yeah, some of the water that's coming out,</v>

347
00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:27.191
we have to get away from distilled water

348
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:29.020
because it's dead, and it's acidic,

349
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.407
and it actually creates more harm in the body,

350
00:13:31.407 --> 00:13:34.415
but some of the purification systems

351
00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:36.639
that they're using aren't really working,

352
00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:39.073
but we need to get back to a live water,

353
00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:41.021
which is some of the water technologies we worked on

354
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:42.170
where the water's alive.

355
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.593
It's very pure,

356
00:13:43.593 --> 00:13:45.640
and actually I work with a German physicist

357
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.438
that actually crystallized oxygen and suspended it

358
00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:50.994
in a micro-hydrant, which hydrates the body,

359
00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:54.777
and oxygen is the highest systemic antibody you can get,

360
00:13:54.777 --> 00:13:57.682
and when you increase the blood oxygen,

361
00:13:57.682 --> 00:13:59.840
you start rejuvenating the body,

362
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.668
and, you know, even cancer is anaerobic.

363
00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:03.709
It hates oxygen.

364
00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

365
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.715
<v ->So almost all your pathogens are anaerobic,</v>

366
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:10.009
and so if you increase the blood oxygen,

367
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:11.523
one of the main problems is that oxygen levels on the planet

368
00:14:11.523 --> 00:14:13.745
are falling rapidly right now,

369
00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:16.753
and they used to be 35% maybe 100 years ago.

370
00:14:16.753 --> 00:14:20.036
Now they're 17% in really good places,

371
00:14:20.036 --> 00:14:21.969
but Tokyo and some of the major cities,

372
00:14:21.969 --> 00:14:23.814
they're down to 7%.

373
00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:24.643
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

374
00:14:24.643 --> 00:14:27.683
<v ->And we're just not getting the fuel to our brain,</v>

375
00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:29.083
to our heart, to our body.

376
00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:30.000
<v Voiceover>Well, and this creates so</v>

377
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.784
<v ->to cells.</v>

378
00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:31.866
<v Voiceover>many chronic diseases.</v>

379
00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:33.483
<v ->Yeah, and also, people can't think right,</v>

380
00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:34.224
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

381
00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:35.554
<v ->and they do crazy stuff</v>

382
00:14:35.554 --> 00:14:37.465
and have a lot of accidents

383
00:14:37.465 --> 00:14:39.206
and make a lot of serious mistakes.

384
00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:40.316
<v Voiceover>Oxygen deprivation, absolutely.</v>

385
00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:41.506
<v ->Exactly.</v>

386
00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:42.414
Well, and then also we're looking

387
00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:44.939
at a whole subtext to this,

388
00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:48.996
which is the evolution of the human DNA,

389
00:14:48.996 --> 00:14:50.554
and this is another,

390
00:14:50.554 --> 00:14:53.178
is this an area that you're comfortable getting into

391
00:14:53.178 --> 00:14:55.378
or you've been given much information regarding?

392
00:14:55.378 --> 00:14:57.740
<v ->I've given a lot of information about the DNA.</v>

393
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.685
There's a lot of information out there

394
00:15:00.685 --> 00:15:02.201
that's a little off,

395
00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.311
and I work with biophysicists and top people

396
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:05.476
that really know what's going on,

397
00:15:05.476 --> 00:15:09.474
but there's actually 13 strands of DNA

398
00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.624
and a lot of us are just operating out of two

399
00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:13.488
with so many codons activated.

400
00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:16.381
The more you mediate and do your spiritual practices,

401
00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:18.545
the more codons are activated.

402
00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:19.654
The more lines become active.

403
00:15:19.654 --> 00:15:21.697
Junk DNA is not junk,

404
00:15:21.697 --> 00:15:22.876
It's just inactive,

405
00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:25.388
so the more you activate this DNA,

406
00:15:25.388 --> 00:15:27.087
and you can do it through technology

407
00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:29.645
or through spirituality as well,

408
00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:32.919
and, you know, Bruce Lipton's work proved that,

409
00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:35.183
without a doubt, that DNA is more like the gonads

410
00:15:35.183 --> 00:15:36.521
of the body.

411
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:38.818
It's not the brain,

412
00:15:38.818 --> 00:15:42.753
and the cells are actually picking up outside

413
00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:45.822
with their antenna, you know.

414
00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:49.112
We're perception-driven units, basically.

415
00:15:49.112 --> 00:15:52.244
The cells are actually changing to their environment,

416
00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:55.114
and they're picking up energy outside the cells, as well,

417
00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:57.814
so they've proved there's not enough genes

418
00:15:57.814 --> 00:15:59.666
to actually operate the body,

419
00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:02.075
so the body's being operated by another energy field

420
00:16:02.075 --> 00:16:05.531
outside the body, which is, whatever you want to call it,

421
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:08.140
our spirit, our soul, our energy body,

422
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.764
and there's bodies within bodies within bodies,

423
00:16:10.764 --> 00:16:12.347
so it's important to realize

424
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:16.762
that as we become more acquainted and more in touch

425
00:16:16.762 --> 00:16:19.221
with our higher consciousness and energy

426
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:21.163
or these higher bodies, our DNA is gonna change

427
00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:24.996
to adapt to that.

428
00:16:24.996 --> 00:16:26.876
<v Voiceover>And how are you seeing this playing out</v>

429
00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:29.172
in your own life and your own experience?

430
00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:30.793
You seem like you've gone through, gone through

431
00:16:30.793 --> 00:16:31.892
a lot of personal change.

432
00:16:31.892 --> 00:16:32.476
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

433
00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:33.759
<v Voiceover>Even since I last saw you a few years ago.</v>

434
00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:37.958
<v ->Yeah, it's a, it's interesting</v>

435
00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.513
I've gone through so many changes,

436
00:16:39.513 --> 00:16:42.166
and now it's just, everything just is.

437
00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:44.158
You know, it just is,

438
00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:47.568
and I don't, there's not too much that upsets me anymore.

439
00:16:47.568 --> 00:16:50.504
I don't get too caught up in it,

440
00:16:50.504 --> 00:16:53.096
and I realize everybody's eternal,

441
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.943
and we're all having experiences down here.

442
00:16:54.943 --> 00:16:56.843
Some of us are gonna ascend,

443
00:16:56.843 --> 00:16:58.737
and some of us are gonna come back in diapers, you know,

444
00:16:58.737 --> 00:16:59.991
depending on the choices
<v Voiceover>Again.</v>

445
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:01.859
<v ->that we make. Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Again.</v>

446
00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:03.652
<v ->So, so it's kind of like</v>

447
00:17:03.652 --> 00:17:05.185
I just realize everything's eternal

448
00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:08.752
and just try to educate people as, you know,

449
00:17:08.752 --> 00:17:10.351
there's a better way of doing things.

450
00:17:10.351 --> 00:17:11.963
<v Voiceover>How are you seeing this shift</v>

451
00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:14.541
in the kind of people that are being drawn to your farm?

452
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.871
<v ->A lot different.</v>

453
00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:19.678
In the beginning, you know,

454
00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:21.203
I wanted to take care of everybody,

455
00:17:21.203 --> 00:17:23.535
and I just, it was really focused on that,

456
00:17:23.535 --> 00:17:24.994
and then I realized that people really need

457
00:17:24.994 --> 00:17:26.397
to take care of themselves,

458
00:17:26.397 --> 00:17:28.397
and I went through all these transitions,

459
00:17:28.397 --> 00:17:29.626
and in the beginning,

460
00:17:29.626 --> 00:17:31.031
there was a lot of people that came up

461
00:17:31.031 --> 00:17:32.658
they're very needy, very demanding,

462
00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:35.551
very, causing a lot of problems,

463
00:17:35.551 --> 00:17:37.785
and now, we're getting a whole different quality of people

464
00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:38.933
that are more sovereign.

465
00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.998
They're more clear, and they're more service oriented,

466
00:17:41.998 --> 00:17:45.678
and there's not all the drama that comes with it.

467
00:17:45.678 --> 00:17:46.905
<v Voiceover>What about the kids?</v>

468
00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:48.329
<v ->Oh, the kids are incredible</v>

469
00:17:48.329 --> 00:17:49.922
that are coming to the ranch right now.

470
00:17:49.922 --> 00:17:52.587
We have beings that, you know,

471
00:17:52.587 --> 00:17:54.577
they talk about the indigo beings

472
00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:56.444
and the golden beings and all of that,

473
00:17:56.444 --> 00:18:00.526
and these kids are so pure and so innocent

474
00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:01.858
and so tuned in.

475
00:18:01.858 --> 00:18:02.593
They're tapped in,

476
00:18:02.593 --> 00:18:04.968
and they know how to say no. (laughs)

477
00:18:04.968 --> 00:18:06.364
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

478
00:18:06.364 --> 00:18:07.310
<v ->Very well, you know,</v>

479
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.243
and if it's not aligned

480
00:18:08.243 --> 00:18:11.034
with what they feel is right or whatever,

481
00:18:11.034 --> 00:18:12.779
they'll tell you, right up, right up front,

482
00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:15.124
and they're, they're comin' in right now,

483
00:18:15.124 --> 00:18:16.294
and they're very gifted,

484
00:18:16.294 --> 00:18:18.574
and they're comin' in for these changes.

485
00:18:18.574 --> 00:18:20.554
<v Voiceover>What are you seeing by way of communication,</v>

486
00:18:20.554 --> 00:18:22.438
when you have everyone together

487
00:18:22.438 --> 00:18:24.471
and you start consciously interacting with the various,

488
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:27.703
the various craft that come and go

489
00:18:27.703 --> 00:18:30.003
during the course of an event or an evening?

490
00:18:30.003 --> 00:18:32.345
What are you, what are you seeing

491
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:37.243
with the children, in particular, and the kinds of,

492
00:18:37.243 --> 00:18:39.830
the kinds of communication going on with the others,

493
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.087
from that place of innocence and joy?

494
00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:43.603
<v ->Some of the things we've seen are,</v>

495
00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:45.591
one short story I want to talk about was,

496
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.488
we had a bunch of people there,

497
00:18:47.488 --> 00:18:48.828
and we're all sittin' around the campfire,

498
00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:50.111
and they're going, where's the ships,

499
00:18:50.111 --> 00:18:50.961
where's the, you know,

500
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:52.834
the people are goin', well I'm here, where are ya,

501
00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:55.283
and they just weren't really doing their focus work

502
00:18:55.283 --> 00:18:59.358
or focusing on intention in creating that event,

503
00:18:59.358 --> 00:19:02.769
and this one little kid picks up a marshmallow, you know,

504
00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:04.432
that he was cooking, and he cooked it,

505
00:19:04.432 --> 00:19:05.781
and he picked it up,

506
00:19:05.781 --> 00:19:06.781
and he started walking out in the field,

507
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:07.805
and he goes, here Mr. Spaceman,

508
00:19:07.805 --> 00:19:10.456
he goes, I have a marshmallow for you, like this.

509
00:19:10.456 --> 00:19:12.372
Two ships just went, puff,

510
00:19:12.372 --> 00:19:13.464
and they were there the whole time,

511
00:19:13.464 --> 00:19:14.365
they just weren't makin',

512
00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:15.987
they just powered up,

513
00:19:15.987 --> 00:19:17.702
and then took off together and went off.

514
00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:20.162
You know, it, it took this
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

515
00:19:20.162 --> 00:19:21.969
<v ->innocence of this kid, you know,</v>

516
00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:25.037
to initiate that, to make it happen.

517
00:19:25.037 --> 00:19:26.077
<v Voiceover>So what's that telling us</v>

518
00:19:26.077 --> 00:19:27.944
about the rest of us adults?

519
00:19:27.944 --> 00:19:29.634
<v ->There's an old saying, you know,</v>

520
00:19:29.634 --> 00:19:30.628
you have to become like a child

521
00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.204
before you enter the kingdom of heaven.

522
00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.268
Well, this is heaven.

523
00:19:33.268 --> 00:19:34.424
Heaven is comin' to Earth,

524
00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.678
and it includes all these ultra-dimensional beings

525
00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:40.037
and masters and angelic beings and everything else,

526
00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:43.303
but we have to let go of our impatience

527
00:19:43.303 --> 00:19:46.939
and our demands and our arrogance and all of this stuff

528
00:19:46.939 --> 00:19:50.775
and again become more innocent in awe

529
00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:52.958
and allow this to happen.

530
00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.668
<v Voiceover>And would you say that we have to give up</v>

531
00:19:54.668 --> 00:19:56.901
our perceptions of how it's supposed to show up?

532
00:19:56.901 --> 00:19:59.799
<v ->Exactly, that's one of the main things is</v>

533
00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:01.682
people have a pretty conceived idea,

534
00:20:01.682 --> 00:20:04.181
and they have a lot of demands, and when they come,

535
00:20:04.181 --> 00:20:06.456
they come with that,

536
00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.318
and they usually have to lose that

537
00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:10.184
before anything can happen,

538
00:20:10.184 --> 00:20:12.484
and they really know how to put the intent down

539
00:20:12.484 --> 00:20:16.616
and use their own spiritual communication, you might say,

540
00:20:16.616 --> 00:20:17.994
to contact these ships

541
00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:20.068
'cause they're very, very spiritually

542
00:20:20.068 --> 00:20:22.346
and technologically advanced.

543
00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.591
We have a lot of activity.

544
00:20:23.591 --> 00:20:24.541
They come down real low.

545
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:26.774
They affect everybody there.

546
00:20:26.774 --> 00:20:28.191
You feel an energy exchange.

547
00:20:28.191 --> 00:20:30.040
Everybody gets real giddy, real high,

548
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.282
and then other times we have larger groups

549
00:20:32.282 --> 00:20:33.598
where people are unfocused,

550
00:20:33.598 --> 00:20:35.445
and there'll be some negativity

551
00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:36.872
or some real skepticism there.

552
00:20:36.872 --> 00:20:38.673
You know, wives will bring their husbands

553
00:20:38.673 --> 00:20:40.696
which don't even want to be there, you know.

554
00:20:40.696 --> 00:20:42.388
<v Voiceover>Not a good idea.</v>

555
00:20:42.388 --> 00:20:43.938
<v ->And things like that and it changes the energy,</v>

556
00:20:43.938 --> 00:20:47.487
so the ships stay high and not too much happens.

557
00:20:47.487 --> 00:20:49.861
<v Voiceover>Have you had the presence of</v>

558
00:20:49.861 --> 00:20:54.326
people who are maybe trying to,

559
00:20:54.326 --> 00:20:57.459
oh, I hate to use these conspiratorial words,

560
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:58.775
but almost infiltrate
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

561
00:20:58.775 --> 00:20:59.625
<v Voiceover>what you're doing</v>

562
00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.946
and had some, have you had any events occur

563
00:21:02.946 --> 00:21:05.469
around that, that might have been of a surprising nature?

564
00:21:05.469 --> 00:21:09.694
<v ->We've had almost every (mumbles) agency at the ranch</v>

565
00:21:09.694 --> 00:21:10.894
that have come up,

566
00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:12.660
and what's interesting is, you know,

567
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.861
they made some bad decisions in the past,

568
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:15.968
and they're just making sure

569
00:21:15.968 --> 00:21:18.842
that we're working with the more benevolent ones right now,

570
00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:20.108
but when they come to the ranch,

571
00:21:20.108 --> 00:21:22.017
they go through a shift and a change,

572
00:21:22.017 --> 00:21:23.382
and they usually quit.

573
00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:26.083
They have a real hard time experiencing

574
00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:27.532
that higher conscious and energy

575
00:21:27.532 --> 00:21:29.723
or being involved with it for very long,

576
00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:32.333
and then going back to the system that they're in, you know,

577
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.455
being with all the constrictions and,

578
00:21:35.455 --> 00:21:39.625
but we've seen that again and again where people will come,

579
00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:41.867
and they're blown away.

580
00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:43.111
We just had a scientist come up,

581
00:21:43.111 --> 00:21:44.494
and he came to debunk it all,

582
00:21:44.494 --> 00:21:47.543
and now he's working 24/7 with us,

583
00:21:47.543 --> 00:21:48.702
getting this all out

584
00:21:48.702 --> 00:21:50.918
because he had so many experiences,

585
00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:53.401
he just couldn't put them in his box anymore,

586
00:21:53.401 --> 00:21:55.075
and finally he just exploded,

587
00:21:55.075 --> 00:22:00.075
and now he's just as zealous in the positive way

588
00:22:00.366 --> 00:22:02.271
that he was, you know, in the negative.

589
00:22:02.271 --> 00:22:03.707
<v Voiceover>So do you find then</v>

590
00:22:03.707 --> 00:22:05.763
that this is becoming more frequent,

591
00:22:05.763 --> 00:22:08.397
that people who have really been in a position

592
00:22:08.397 --> 00:22:11.344
that's very closed down or unaccepting

593
00:22:11.344 --> 00:22:14.903
and maybe in positions that are reinforcing that

594
00:22:14.903 --> 00:22:17.563
or working for agencies that reinforces in the negative?

595
00:22:17.563 --> 00:22:19.842
Are you finding just a lot more breaking out of that

596
00:22:19.842 --> 00:22:21.646
as the fabric tears apart?

597
00:22:21.646 --> 00:22:24.800
<v ->Exactly, a lot of these agencies</v>

598
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.293
that aren't really serving humanity and the Earth,

599
00:22:27.293 --> 00:22:30.916
and they're very constrictive, you might say,

600
00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:34.358
or they're taking away individual freedom and prosperity

601
00:22:34.358 --> 00:22:37.557
and not really serving humanity to Earth,

602
00:22:37.557 --> 00:22:38.515
those are collapsing,

603
00:22:38.515 --> 00:22:40.599
and people within those agencies

604
00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:41.840
are saying I can't do this anymore.

605
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.749
I'm done, and they're walking,

606
00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:46.166
and so they're having a lot of,

607
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:49.949
you might say, shifts within the agencies

608
00:22:49.949 --> 00:22:51.667
and splittings, you might say,

609
00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:53.303
and I think eventually those agencies

610
00:22:53.303 --> 00:22:56.813
would either come online and serve humanity

611
00:22:56.813 --> 00:22:58.799
like they were designed to do,

612
00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.521
or they will collapse.

613
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:05.501
<v Voiceover>So you're really feeling hopeful at this time</v>

614
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:06.852
from everything you know,

615
00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:07.688
everything you've seen

616
00:23:07.688 --> 00:23:09.039
all the contact?

617
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:11.813
Can you give us an overview of

618
00:23:11.813 --> 00:23:14.332
how you see this picture playing out,

619
00:23:14.332 --> 00:23:15.230
what's it gonna look like,

620
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.937
bumps and warts and all along the way,

621
00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:18.937
and what your vision is.

622
00:23:19.317 --> 00:23:22.005
<v ->I've had a lot of visions of the future,</v>

623
00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:24.594
and some of the things they've shown me is,

624
00:23:24.594 --> 00:23:27.810
they've shown me that the grid is going down.

625
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.926
That the electrical grid that we all depend on

626
00:23:30.926 --> 00:23:32.166
is going down,

627
00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:35.156
and they also are showing that the,

628
00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:37.732
that's right around towards the end of 2009,

629
00:23:37.732 --> 00:23:39.348
and they're showing an increase

630
00:23:39.348 --> 00:23:41.790
in the earthquakes and the volcanic activity

631
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.202
and the tornadoes and hurricanes.

632
00:23:44.202 --> 00:23:46.323
That's all escalating due to the solar maximum

633
00:23:46.323 --> 00:23:47.213
<v Voiceover>Oh right.</v>

634
00:23:47.213 --> 00:23:48.440
<v ->that we're moving into.</v>

635
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.746
Yeah, it's going up to a crescendo,

636
00:23:50.746 --> 00:23:54.396
where we get the grid going down from some massive flares,

637
00:23:54.755 --> 00:23:56.190
and then, at the end of that.

638
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.878
<v Voiceover>I think that by NASA's own prognostications</v>

639
00:23:58.878 --> 00:23:59.631
<v ->Exactly.</v>

640
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:00.762
<v Voiceover>that's supposed to happen in 2012.</v>

641
00:24:00.762 --> 00:24:04.235
<v ->Yeah, 2010, between 2010 is when it happens,</v>

642
00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:06.815
but 2012 it peaks.
<v Voiceover>It peaks.</v>

643
00:24:06.815 --> 00:24:07.765
<v ->Then it's done,</v>

644
00:24:07.765 --> 00:24:09.287
and then it starts goin' on the downswing,

645
00:24:09.287 --> 00:24:12.514
and then we're gonna be seeing that happening,

646
00:24:12.514 --> 00:24:14.614
but in that process,

647
00:24:14.614 --> 00:24:16.640
there's a lot of people waking up to, as well,

648
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.330
and they're moving, you know, off the coast and off the,

649
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.946
'cause you don't want to be along the coast

650
00:24:20.946 --> 00:24:22.113
while all this is going on

651
00:24:22.113 --> 00:24:24.421
because there's gonna be tsunamis and large earthquakes

652
00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:25.471
out in the oceans,

653
00:24:25.471 --> 00:24:27.927
so you'll see a lot of movement going on.

654
00:24:27.927 --> 00:24:32.456
People are really moving into a more free life, you know,

655
00:24:32.456 --> 00:24:35.432
that supports their new consciousness,

656
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:38.768
and I just see a huge shift of people

657
00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:40.276
choosing the new world

658
00:24:40.276 --> 00:24:42.609
versus people trying to hang onto the old world

659
00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:44.835
because the old world's going,

660
00:24:44.835 --> 00:24:46.419
and there's gonna be a lot of clean up going on,

661
00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:48.496
you know, because there's an old saying,

662
00:24:48.496 --> 00:24:51.015
you don't put new wine into old skins, you know.

663
00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:52.085
They burst, you know,

664
00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:57.085
so the Earth is gonna rejuvenate and renew herself,

665
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.884
and she's gonna go through a lot of changes,

666
00:24:58.884 --> 00:25:03.291
and through that process, but it just has to clean up

667
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:05.124
for the new consciousness

668
00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:08.140
and the new civilization to come in.

669
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.454
<v Voiceover>And we are going to have to clean up</v>

670
00:25:10.454 --> 00:25:11.804
on a deep internal level.

671
00:25:11.804 --> 00:25:13.046
<v ->Exactly, everything.</v>

672
00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:15.673
We have to let go of the old wounds and traumas

673
00:25:15.673 --> 00:25:17.680
and raw conclusions from past experience

674
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.263
that we're carrying in our fields.

675
00:25:19.263 --> 00:25:20.838
We have to clean up our diet,

676
00:25:20.838 --> 00:25:23.154
clean up our consciousness on every level.

677
00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:25.037
We have to kind of clean up.

678
00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:28.006
<v Voiceover>And as a human family,</v>

679
00:25:28.006 --> 00:25:30.281
it appears that we're going to need

680
00:25:30.281 --> 00:25:33.101
to become interdependent with one another again.

681
00:25:33.101 --> 00:25:33.910
<v ->Yeah.</v>

682
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:34.989
<v Voiceover>And maybe simplify?</v>

683
00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:36.867
<v ->Exactly.</v>

684
00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:41.116
I see it more as a sovereign cooperative, you might say,

685
00:25:41.116 --> 00:25:42.416
where people are sovereign.

686
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:44.457
They're walking in their own self-authority,

687
00:25:44.457 --> 00:25:47.186
but they also cooperate.

688
00:25:47.186 --> 00:25:50.281
They understand the unity of all life and everyone

689
00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:51.631
and that we're all connected

690
00:25:51.631 --> 00:25:54.213
and working in that, in that direction.

691
00:25:54.213 --> 00:25:56.106
<v Voiceover>And that might even mean</v>

692
00:25:56.106 --> 00:25:59.479
we have to invite the family back in. (laughs)

693
00:25:59.479 --> 00:26:01.435
<v ->(laughs) Yeah, exactly.</v>

694
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:03.460
<v Voiceover>In a blood sense</v>

695
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.720
and also in larger sense of what family is

696
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.525
and begin helping each other, maybe go back to the land,

697
00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:10.744
get closer to the land again,

698
00:26:10.744 --> 00:26:13.096
which seems to me, that's all a good thing.

699
00:26:13.096 --> 00:26:15.316
<v ->It's very important to get back in touch with nature.</v>

700
00:26:15.316 --> 00:26:16.839
You know, they all say, you know,

701
00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:17.949
you take a man out of nature,

702
00:26:17.949 --> 00:26:19.324
you harden his heart,

703
00:26:19.324 --> 00:26:20.999
and it's very true,

704
00:26:20.999 --> 00:26:23.729
so we definitely have to get back in touch with nature.

705
00:26:23.729 --> 00:26:24.829
<v Voiceover>Any summaries?</v>

706
00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:25.679
Any final thoughts before,

707
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.284
I know, you just did a big presentation,

708
00:26:27.284 --> 00:26:28.528
and I know you want to go to dinner,

709
00:26:28.528 --> 00:26:29.404
you want to go to dinner,

710
00:26:29.404 --> 00:26:30.407
and you have people waiting,
<v ->Yeah.</v>

711
00:26:30.407 --> 00:26:31.401
<v Voiceover>so, any final thoughts</v>

712
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:33.647
before we sign off for this time?

713
00:26:33.647 --> 00:26:36.354
<v ->I think it's important that each individual knows</v>

714
00:26:36.354 --> 00:26:37.953
that they're greatly loved,

715
00:26:37.953 --> 00:26:40.951
and there is a non-judging source out there

716
00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:43.585
that is supportive and that will assist them

717
00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:45.525
in their own awakening and healing process,

718
00:26:45.525 --> 00:26:47.403
and there's legions, you know,

719
00:26:47.403 --> 00:26:49.558
both in the other dimensions and planes

720
00:26:49.558 --> 00:26:51.583
that are assisting in this process,

721
00:26:51.583 --> 00:26:52.499
and that you're not alone,

722
00:26:52.499 --> 00:26:54.609
and that we need to really go in

723
00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:56.210
and make our own personal connection

724
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.885
with the source or god or whatever you want to call it

725
00:26:58.885 --> 00:27:01.643
and act on that inner guidance

726
00:27:01.643 --> 00:27:03.407
and know that there's legions that are working

727
00:27:03.407 --> 00:27:06.871
with that source to help us get through these times.

728
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:08.849
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

729
00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:10.007
<v ->Thank you.</v>

730
00:27:10.007 --> 00:27:13.598
<v ->If you enjoyed this interview,</v>

731
00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:16.230
you'll love the documentary done on James' experiences

732
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.276
on the ranch called Contact Has Begun.

733
00:27:19.276 --> 00:27:22.076
We featured it in our movie section on this site this month,

734
00:27:22.076 --> 00:27:23.952
meanwhile, our interview with Stephen Bassett

735
00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:25.048
also shines light

736
00:27:25.048 --> 00:27:28.074
on the subject of UFOs and military secrecy.

737
00:27:28.074 --> 00:27:31.499
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

738
