00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.608
<v ->Gary Schwartz has all the right credentials.</v>

2
00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:05.816
He received his doctorate from Harvard,

3
00:00:05.816 --> 00:00:08.397
taught psychiatry and psychology at Yale,

4
00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:10.808
and is currently a professor of get this,

5
00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:13.058
psychology, medicine, neurology,

6
00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:17.058
psychiatry, and surgery at the University of Arizona.

7
00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.309
Fortunately for everyone who has ever wanted

8
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.623
to communicate with a deceased loved one,

9
00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:24.279
Dr. Schwartz is drawing on all of his knowlege

10
00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.020
in the research of afterlife communications.

11
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.292
In spite of the historic giggle factor

12
00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:31.377
by colleagues and the media.

13
00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.243
Gary, where did this journey begin

14
00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:45.123
with such a prestigious background with prestigious

15
00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:47.938
institutions, how did you end up

16
00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.876
in the area of studying life beyond life?

17
00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.048
<v ->It began in two areas.</v>

18
00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:55.228
One was scientific and one was personal.

19
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:57.783
The scientific side was that when I was a professor

20
00:00:57.783 --> 00:00:59.985
at Yale, and I was

21
00:01:00.108 --> 00:01:02.492
studying the nature of light

22
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.121
I began to realize that light has a kind

23
00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:06.401
of immortality.

24
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:09.068
We look up at the sky at night

25
00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.137
we can see thousands or millions

26
00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:14.316
of stars, and with telescopes of course

27
00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:17.147
we can see thousands and millions of galaxies,

28
00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:19.265
and what physics tells us that the light

29
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:22.187
from these distance stars emanates out into space,

30
00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:25.493
and long after the star has quote died

31
00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:27.663
that light continues.

32
00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.643
When we're looking at the sky at night

33
00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:33.071
we're seeing a history of the starlight,

34
00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.029
and the amazing thing about the universe

35
00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.813
is that starlight doesn't lose it's information.

36
00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:40.687
It doesn't lose it's individuality.

37
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.092
If that light was getting all mixed and all blurred

38
00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:45.268
and following what's called the second law of

39
00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:46.292
thermodynamics.

40
00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:47.593
We look up to the sky at night and we

41
00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:50.489
see mush, and we'd have no astro physics.

42
00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:53.236
Instead, in the quote vacuum of space,

43
00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:56.291
the energy and information is preserved,

44
00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.622
and what physics tells us is that

45
00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:01.107
we're no different from the light from distant stars.

46
00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:03.966
Our bodies and matter is organized energy.

47
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:05.630
We're both reflecting and emitting

48
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.072
not just visible light, but invisible light.

49
00:02:08.072 --> 00:02:09.907
All of this going off into space,

50
00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:12.898
and so what I began to realize was that

51
00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:16.797
to the extent that we are energy and information,

52
00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:18.589
and it continues, and then potentially

53
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.234
our consciousness and love could continue

54
00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:22.791
like the life in distant stars.

55
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.860
That's the scientific side,

56
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.791
but it's one thing to be open scientifically,

57
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.338
it's another thing to actually do research

58
00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:31.269
in the area, and there's where it gets personal.

59
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.897
I met a woman, Dr. Linda Russic whose father,

60
00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:38.054
Dr. Henry Russic had been a distinguished cardiologist

61
00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:41.350
and scientist, and when he died

62
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.507
Linda went on a scientific and metaphysical quest

63
00:02:44.507 --> 00:02:46.971
to discover whether her father was still here,

64
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:49.627
or I met Susie Smith.

65
00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.525
When I met her she was 83 years old.

66
00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:53.595
She has published 29 books in the field

67
00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:55.355
of para psychology and survival of conscious

68
00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:56.613
after death.

69
00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:58.885
In her mid 40s her mother died,

70
00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:01.253
and then she went on a quest

71
00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:02.554
to see whether she could find whether

72
00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:04.756
her mother was still here.

73
00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.910
The bottom line is that I was pushed there

74
00:03:11.514 --> 00:03:13.284
by theory and research,

75
00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:15.625
but I was pulled there by love,

76
00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:17.646
by Linda's lover for her father,

77
00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:19.556
by Susie's love for her mother,

78
00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:22.056
and other people that I met a long the way,

79
00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:23.726
and when you're pushed and pulled

80
00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.819
in the same direction it gets very hard

81
00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.960
to resist.

82
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.094
That's really how I started.

83
00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:32.387
It wasn't like I had a grand plan to

84
00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:33.805
do this kind of work, or that I was

85
00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:36.760
personally interested in the work.

86
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.544
It was a set of circumstances that led me

87
00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.304
to get involved.

88
00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.584
<v Woman>And this could not have been easy,</v>

89
00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:45.645
because you were subject to peer pressure

90
00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.319
and ridicule going into an area that

91
00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.271
has historically been

92
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.983
basically treated in a very derisive way.

93
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:53.612
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

94
00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:56.513
In fact I knew that if I got involved

95
00:03:56.513 --> 00:03:58.561
in this research that a number of my

96
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:01.206
colleagues would be very unhappy.

97
00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:03.574
In fact as I affectionately tell people,

98
00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:06.987
at this point some of my colleagues

99
00:04:06.987 --> 00:04:08.609
would prefer that I do this work

100
00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.482
somewhere else, preferably on another planet.

101
00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:15.531
I was very well aware at the beginning that

102
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.461
if I was gonna go this, I was gonna do

103
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:21.525
it very quietly, especially God forbid,

104
00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.944
we got positive results,

105
00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:26.144
which of course we continued to do,

106
00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.469
and it has now become very visible.

107
00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:32.671
<v Woman>Not only very quietly, but very thoroughly</v>

108
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:33.876
it sounds like,

109
00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:37.008
Can you tell us a little bit about how the

110
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:41.108
more documented aspect of this began taking shape

111
00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:43.913
through your contacts through the university etcetera.

112
00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:44.724
<v ->Yes,</v>

113
00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:49.688
this was a program really in evolution.

114
00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:51.646
I'm trained as a mainstream scientist,

115
00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.344
so I apply the methods of science,

116
00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:57.613
and I approach it from sort of a skeptical

117
00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:00.861
certainly agnostic if not skeptical

118
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:03.229
perspective, and so consequently, if you're gonna do

119
00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:03.485
research in the area, you have to control for

120
00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:06.813
a whole host of things,

121
00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:08.669
including the possibility of fraud,

122
00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.984
the possibility of what's called cold reading

123
00:05:10.984 --> 00:05:13.490
which are techniques that mental magicians use.

124
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.210
By the way, I've actually taken classes in how to be

125
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.020
a fake medium, and I'm pretty good at it.

126
00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:21.831
I know what cheating involves.

127
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.404
You have to address the question of whether

128
00:05:25.404 --> 00:05:26.247
the people who are the sitters,

129
00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:28.636
the people who wanna hear from their loved ones.

130
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:30.929
To what extent they're bias in grabbing

131
00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.532
for information or accepting information.

132
00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:35.739
That really doesn't apply to them.

133
00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:39.729
You have to be sensitive to possible experimenter

134
00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.171
errors or experimenter biases

135
00:05:42.171 --> 00:05:45.584
all these things you have to take into account

136
00:05:45.584 --> 00:05:48.368
if you're gonna address whether mediums are for real,

137
00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:52.266
and we were very sensitive to that right from the beginning

138
00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:55.568
and I began working with one research medium,

139
00:05:55.568 --> 00:05:57.908
one by the name of Laurie Campbell,

140
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.393
doing research in secret,

141
00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:03.364
and we did what are called single blind

142
00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:06.244
and even double blind experiments

143
00:06:06.244 --> 00:06:09.124
where the medium didn't know who the sitter

144
00:06:09.124 --> 00:06:11.727
was, the medium couldn't even talk to the sitter

145
00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:13.348
so that you got no information.

146
00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:16.302
Also the sitter wasn't present or the rater

147
00:06:16.302 --> 00:06:17.924
wasn't present at the time

148
00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:20.483
that the reading was taking place.

149
00:06:20.483 --> 00:06:22.382
<v Woman>Before you go any further, please explain</v>

150
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.662
who the sitter is.

151
00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:27.288
<v ->A sitter would be someone who lost a daughter</v>

152
00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:29.816
or son, or had a spouse who died

153
00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:31.117
or a parent who died,

154
00:06:31.117 --> 00:06:34.940
and wished to hear from their deceased love one,

155
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.898
and in our case they're research sitters,

156
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:38.637
because they're participating in research.

157
00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:40.525
We began with one medium,

158
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.583
and much to my amazement we continued to

159
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:45.143
get positive results, ruling out these things

160
00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:48.183
like fraud, cold reading, and then rater bias

161
00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:49.367
and experimenter error,

162
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:54.367
then through the good fortune of Lisa Jackson

163
00:06:55.201 --> 00:06:58.518
doing a documentary called Life After Life

164
00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.603
for HBO special in 1998.

165
00:07:02.603 --> 00:07:04.758
She was in contact with multiple mediums

166
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.923
including John Edward and George Anderson

167
00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.544
and Suzanne Northrup and Gamein

168
00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:11.872
and others and she was interested in the idea

169
00:07:11.872 --> 00:07:14.464
of science addressing this question.

170
00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:18.479
We had the scientific methods and the expertise.

171
00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:22.751
She had the access to the mediums and the funding.

172
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:24.586
We put our efforts together,

173
00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:26.847
and we did the first ever controlled

174
00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:30.228
multi-medium, multi-sitter experiment

175
00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:32.906
which was actually video taped as a real experiment,

176
00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:36.948
and then ultimately shown on this special Life After Life,

177
00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:38.708
and that enabled me to then develop

178
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:42.772
a solid working relationship with John Edward for example,

179
00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:45.854
and he participated in three experiments in the laboratory

180
00:07:45.854 --> 00:07:49.576
before he became famous, before he had his

181
00:07:49.576 --> 00:07:54.483
television show, and once the work became public

182
00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:58.045
then other mediums started hearing about this.

183
00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:01.010
The way we discover medium is that they

184
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.269
would come to us,

185
00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:07.073
and the second wave of mediums included

186
00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:09.277
a woman by the name of Janet Mayer,

187
00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:11.858
and also a young woman by the name of Allison

188
00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:15.596
Dubai, and Allison is a

189
00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:18.844
participated in the lab for four years,

190
00:08:18.844 --> 00:08:23.164
and based on her remarkable experience

191
00:08:23.164 --> 00:08:25.754
as a medium coupled with her research

192
00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:28.209
in the laboratory, a television program

193
00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:32.016
was ultimately made inspired by her life

194
00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:33.435
which is called Medium,

195
00:08:33.435 --> 00:08:35.846
which is now on NBC.

196
00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:39.280
There's a book coming out this Fall that I wrote

197
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.256
with my writing partner called the truth about medium

198
00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:46.554
which describes four years of research with

199
00:08:46.554 --> 00:08:49.359
the real Allison Dubois, and other mediums

200
00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:51.706
in this wave two group

201
00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:54.234
that reveal some of the remarkable things,

202
00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.463
the surprising things

203
00:08:56.463 --> 00:08:59.972
that they can do, and so the work just continues.

204
00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:01.785
We're now in wave three of mediums,

205
00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:03.172
our next generation of mediums,

206
00:09:03.172 --> 00:09:04.936
and it's quite a privilege.

207
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:07.033
<v Woman>Along the way you did more media.</v>

208
00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:09.998
You had at one point I understand,

209
00:09:09.998 --> 00:09:12.558
if I recall, was it around 1999 you had a special

210
00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:15.576
on HBO where again they taped

211
00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:18.659
mediums and sitters live,

212
00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:20.493
and then over a period of months

213
00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.491
chronicled the results, that was very specifically designed

214
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.808
to be results oriented.

215
00:09:26.808 --> 00:09:28.834
<v ->Yes, and also arts and entertainment</v>

216
00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.063
did a special Beyond Death that we

217
00:09:31.063 --> 00:09:32.525
did demonstration research for,

218
00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:36.215
and I would say every year there have been

219
00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:38.722
at least two or three different

220
00:09:38.722 --> 00:09:41.111
either small segments or larger segments

221
00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:44.023
of programs that have addressed this research.

222
00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:47.681
The public is very interested in this.

223
00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:48.289
<v Woman>It is interesting.</v>

224
00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:50.145
The public is very interested in it,

225
00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:52.289
and just to touch on this for a moment,

226
00:09:52.289 --> 00:09:55.371
when I read your book, the startling

227
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:58.688
statistic was that the mediums

228
00:09:58.688 --> 00:10:02.379
were an average of 83% correct as compared to a control

229
00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:05.056
group of non-mediums who were utilized

230
00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:08.053
to basically try to intuit guess, whatever

231
00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:10.282
under the same conditions
<v ->Right.</v>

232
00:10:10.282 --> 00:10:13.877
<v Woman>And so we're looking at a stark difference</v>

233
00:10:13.877 --> 00:10:16.682
yet the media in the past it seems

234
00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.570
has not particularly treated it

235
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.086
entirely fairly or throughly.

236
00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:24.857
<v ->Yes.</v>

237
00:10:26.132 --> 00:10:28.889
Until very recently

238
00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.942
the media has been for the most part

239
00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:33.801
downright hostile to this work,

240
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.723
and there have been actual cases of

241
00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:39.209
deception used by people in the media

242
00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:41.758
in order to cast it in a negative light

243
00:10:41.758 --> 00:10:44.237
when in fact it was positive.

244
00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:47.080
I tell a story in the book

245
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.930
with a Fox television show where I called

246
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.701
it Double Deception.

247
00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:55.783
In this case it was led by a skeptic,

248
00:10:55.783 --> 00:10:57.671
Michael Shermer

249
00:10:57.671 --> 00:11:00.754
and how they carefully edited it

250
00:11:00.754 --> 00:11:03.026
to make it look like it was a sham,

251
00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:06.695
when in fact they were selectively ignoring

252
00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:09.116
all the positive stuff to make it look like it

253
00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:10.161
was negative.

254
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:12.689
The metaphor is like, let's say that you

255
00:11:12.689 --> 00:11:14.033
wanna know whether Michael Jordan

256
00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:15.356
can really play basketball,

257
00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:18.214
but you're a skeptic, and what you wanna do

258
00:11:18.214 --> 00:11:20.678
is you wanna prove, well make it appear

259
00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:23.718
that not only is there no such thing as basketball,

260
00:11:23.718 --> 00:11:26.832
but Michael can't play this ridiculous game.

261
00:11:26.832 --> 00:11:29.659
What you do is you show a few of his air balls,

262
00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:33.520
and then you show him do a foul or two.

263
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.045
You ignore all the shots that he gets,

264
00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:37.136
and you ignore all the dazzle shots.

265
00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:39.343
You can make him look like an idiot

266
00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:42.245
by the selective emphasis on the negative

267
00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:44.922
and ignoring the positive, and yet we all know

268
00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:47.706
that he was one of the all time great

269
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:48.655
basketball players.

270
00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.841
It's the same thing for Michael Jordans in the medium

271
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:51.556
world.

272
00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:52.676
That did happen

273
00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:53.764
It happened with Dateline.

274
00:11:53.764 --> 00:11:55.620
It happened with a number of

275
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.280
unfortunate programs.

276
00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:01.437
That seems to be changing.

277
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:06.936
It seems like the media has now had

278
00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:09.394
enough exposure to

279
00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:14.275
certainly mediums that have been on multiple

280
00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:17.389
television programs including Larry King,

281
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:20.237
and so on, but also they've had enough exposure now

282
00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:22.007
that the beginnings of the research

283
00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:24.162
where it appears in People magazine

284
00:12:24.162 --> 00:12:26.327
or TV Guide or wherever the Kings may be

285
00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:28.834
so that now they're more open.

286
00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:29.922
<v Woman>Safer to cover it.</v>

287
00:12:29.922 --> 00:12:32.343
<v ->It is safer to cover it, exactly.</v>

288
00:12:32.343 --> 00:12:35.959
They still feel the need to quote balance it,

289
00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.326
and what balance means is.

290
00:12:38.326 --> 00:12:40.630
You have the mediums claim what they do.

291
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.507
You have the scientists report the results which

292
00:12:42.507 --> 00:12:45.483
for the most part are extraordinarily positive.

293
00:12:45.483 --> 00:12:47.712
Then you have some skeptic come on

294
00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:49.824
whose a paid professional skeptic

295
00:12:49.824 --> 00:12:52.331
who makes his reputation by debunking,

296
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:54.048
and he says, oh it's all fraud,

297
00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:56.256
or he says, well you can't trust the scientists,

298
00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:59.594
and what they do is they present all of this

299
00:12:59.594 --> 00:13:02.805
in a quote balanced way as if somehow

300
00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:05.610
these comments by these professional skeptics

301
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.183
have any credibility.

302
00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:10.318
We have to go get past the quote

303
00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.692
giving a balanced representation

304
00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:16.313
to actually following what the data really are,

305
00:13:16.319 --> 00:13:18.175
and allowing the conclusions

306
00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:19.401
that are justified

307
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:20.718
to be spoken.

308
00:13:20.724 --> 00:13:22.100
<v Woman>I will second that as a news anchor.</v>

309
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.884
That was our charge to always make everything

310
00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:29.197
have the appearance of balance.

311
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.195
That's a very different thing

312
00:13:30.195 --> 00:13:32.307
than actually having balanced reporting.

313
00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:35.656
Very seldom was it actually balanced.

314
00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:38.205
You just had to dig up anybody who would

315
00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:40.349
take a counter viewpoint, whether they've read the

316
00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:41.810
study or not,
<v ->Exactly.</v>

317
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.272
<v Woman>And then suddenly it's balanced.</v>

318
00:13:43.272 --> 00:13:44.552
I know what you're up against.

319
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.381
<v ->I will never forget when Dateline</v>

320
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:50.493
came out to do this special,

321
00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:53.212
and I told them that I was willing to actually

322
00:13:53.212 --> 00:13:56.188
show them the raw data of multiple experiments

323
00:13:56.188 --> 00:13:57.745
and they could watch it on television,

324
00:13:57.745 --> 00:14:00.668
but what I wanted was them to promise

325
00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:03.825
that the skeptic would actually see the data

326
00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:07.446
before he made his comments.

327
00:14:07.707 --> 00:14:08.817
They promised.

328
00:14:08.817 --> 00:14:11.227
They come out, and they come into the lab,

329
00:14:11.227 --> 00:14:12.667
and they set up all the lighting.

330
00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:16.294
The announcer and interviewer is there,

331
00:14:16.294 --> 00:14:18.282
and so on, and

332
00:14:18.565 --> 00:14:20.027
he was very skeptical.

333
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:23.045
The data spoke for itself,

334
00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:23.813
and they were all done.

335
00:14:23.813 --> 00:14:24.976
I said are you going off to the

336
00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:27.162
skeptic?

337
00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:29.620
And they said oh, no we filmed him yesterday

338
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.437
in New York.

339
00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:31.482
I said wait a second.

340
00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:33.594
If you filmed him yesterday, he hasn't seen

341
00:14:33.594 --> 00:14:36.809
these results, so how can he comment?

342
00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:38.052
She said, well you know we were busy,

343
00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:39.674
and we just had to fit it into our schedule.

344
00:14:39.674 --> 00:14:42.921
The way they showed it on television was

345
00:14:43.087 --> 00:14:45.966
they start off for example with John in his life.

346
00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:49.476
Then they interview me showing the research,

347
00:14:49.476 --> 00:14:51.363
John and other mediums doing what they're doing.

348
00:14:51.363 --> 00:14:53.139
Then they take a break,

349
00:14:53.475 --> 00:14:56.163
and then they feed in the skeptic as if the

350
00:14:56.163 --> 00:15:00.206
skeptic had any knowledge of the real data

351
00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:02.595
and what was being said, and so of course

352
00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:04.963
they gave a false impression.

353
00:15:04.963 --> 00:15:07.469
That's unfortunate, and I don't think

354
00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:09.144
the public should stand for that.

355
00:15:09.144 --> 00:15:10.658
<v Woman>The good thing is as you say,</v>

356
00:15:10.658 --> 00:15:12.493
it's changing and it's changing because

357
00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:14.765
the public is now demanding that it change,

358
00:15:14.765 --> 00:15:17.111
because in essence the media is only a response

359
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.340
to what it is we desire in the end,

360
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.474
what we're willing to put up with,

361
00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:24.492
and that means the public wants the real skinny now.

362
00:15:24.492 --> 00:15:27.351
(laugher)

363
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.070
<v ->I applaud the public for wanting to hear the truth</v>

364
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.361
at least about this matter.

365
00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:33.445
Hopefully other matters as well.

366
00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:34.827
<v Woman>I would like to ask you questions having</v>

367
00:15:34.827 --> 00:15:36.523
to do very specifically with this,

368
00:15:36.523 --> 00:15:38.891
because your book really goes on to

369
00:15:38.891 --> 00:15:41.632
cover a lot more than just these experiments.

370
00:15:41.632 --> 00:15:43.606
You have a great amount of depth,

371
00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:45.387
a great amount of curiosity,

372
00:15:45.387 --> 00:15:49.056
and it's admirable that all of the areas in which

373
00:15:49.056 --> 00:15:53.096
you've already explored and are able to speak

374
00:15:53.096 --> 00:15:55.455
so eloquently, and one of them has to do

375
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.677
with the subject of the essential

376
00:15:58.677 --> 00:16:01.738
vibration as it were of love and how that

377
00:16:01.738 --> 00:16:06.015
feeds into the ability to communicate

378
00:16:06.015 --> 00:16:09.588
to what's beyond, and to past transition

379
00:16:09.588 --> 00:16:10.793
shall we say.

380
00:16:10.793 --> 00:16:12.350
Can you speak a little bit about

381
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.836
what you think is actually happening

382
00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:17.598
when you have a sitter, a medium,

383
00:16:17.598 --> 00:16:19.945
and then the one that medium is connecting

384
00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:21.752
with or the ones?

385
00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:26.707
<v ->If we accept over eight years of research,</v>

386
00:16:26.707 --> 00:16:29.469
and we're willing to accept the fact that these

387
00:16:29.469 --> 00:16:32.296
particular meetings are not engaged in fraud

388
00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:35.016
and any of that, that this is real genuine information

389
00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:36.893
that they're getting quote anonymously,

390
00:16:36.893 --> 00:16:39.709
and also that the medium is not

391
00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:42.604
reading the mind of the sitter.

392
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.554
She's not just simply giving you what you wanna hear

393
00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:48.455
by reading your mind or even reading your unconscious,

394
00:16:48.455 --> 00:16:50.599
and she's not also just reading

395
00:16:50.599 --> 00:16:53.873
quote dead information in space, but that really

396
00:16:53.873 --> 00:16:57.212
there's a living conscious intentional presence

397
00:16:57.212 --> 00:16:58.470
of a deceased person.

398
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.713
We call this quote discarnate intention,

399
00:17:01.713 --> 00:17:03.526
that's the scientific term for this.

400
00:17:03.526 --> 00:17:05.126
If we accept this for the moment,

401
00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:07.349
then the question is how does it work?

402
00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:12.795
First of all the bottom line in all of this

403
00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:14.576
from our research and also from theory

404
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.464
is the bottom line is love,

405
00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:17.669
and people often ask me, they say

406
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:18.533
well gee,

407
00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:21.887
why are these people hanging around?

408
00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:23.907
Why do they wanna talk,

409
00:17:23.907 --> 00:17:26.404
and why are they saying such often quote

410
00:17:26.404 --> 00:17:28.020
mundane things?

411
00:17:28.676 --> 00:17:31.646
And my explanation is simple.

412
00:17:32.089 --> 00:17:34.889
This is what comes through over and over again.

413
00:17:35.897 --> 00:17:38.564
The number one bond that we have

414
00:17:38.564 --> 00:17:43.564
in the physical is love, and love is the most

415
00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:48.026
powerful, and the most enduring of

416
00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:53.364
emotions and motivators for relationship,

417
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.775
and people who experience love, with their children,

418
00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:57.652
with their spouses, with their parents, with their friends.

419
00:17:57.652 --> 00:17:59.934
If they experience love with music

420
00:17:59.934 --> 00:18:01.321
or with art or with science

421
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:03.571
or with knowledge or with sports or whatever

422
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:08.360
the more genuine love they can have in their lives

423
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.376
the more meaningful their lives are,

424
00:18:10.376 --> 00:18:13.725
and of course there's no replacement for human relationship,

425
00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:17.395
and just because one person loses their

426
00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:21.149
physical body doesn't mean that they lose their caring.

427
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:22.941
That doesn't mean that they lose their

428
00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:26.706
desire to be with the people that they love the most.

429
00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:30.812
It's really no different between wanting to see someone

430
00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:32.764
if you're in the physical and wanting to see someone

431
00:18:32.764 --> 00:18:35.175
if they're not in the physical,

432
00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:38.497
and this motivation continues

433
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:41.958
to serve as core connection,

434
00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.553
and that bond that can not just even maintained

435
00:18:45.553 --> 00:18:46.321
or sustained.

436
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:49.553
It can even be developed to the extent of the person

437
00:18:49.553 --> 00:18:51.547
and the physical is open, and the person

438
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:55.312
who has transitioned equally cares as well.

439
00:18:55.312 --> 00:18:59.024
Love becomes the ultimate energy, the ultimate force

440
00:18:59.024 --> 00:19:02.437
behind this, and imagine for the moment

441
00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:07.437
that you're deceased, and you are

442
00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:12.378
your mother and daughter whose in her 20s

443
00:19:12.378 --> 00:19:16.297
has been waiting for months to see a medium.

444
00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:19.524
Just because you've died, let's imagine

445
00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:21.243
that you're still with your daughter.

446
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.011
You still over see your daughter.

447
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:23.478
You care, but she doesn't hear you.

448
00:19:23.478 --> 00:19:25.014
She can't see you,

449
00:19:25.014 --> 00:19:27.734
but the medium can, and you know your daughter

450
00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:30.949
has this scheduled, because you tend to be around her.

451
00:19:31.382 --> 00:19:34.069
When that half hour or hour

452
00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:37.418
of time arrives where you can actually communicate through

453
00:19:37.418 --> 00:19:39.546
the medium, what are you gonna do?

454
00:19:40.064 --> 00:19:41.386
The first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna

455
00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:43.353
identify yourself.

456
00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:44.703
You're gonna wanna show what you look like.

457
00:19:44.703 --> 00:19:46.933
You're gonna wanna be able to give

458
00:19:46.933 --> 00:19:49.631
your name, provide you with your hair,

459
00:19:49.631 --> 00:19:52.607
give details about for example how you died.

460
00:19:52.607 --> 00:19:55.977
Give just enough information so your daughter

461
00:19:55.977 --> 00:19:57.737
knows it's you, and that's

462
00:19:57.737 --> 00:19:59.092
one kind of thing you typically see

463
00:19:59.092 --> 00:20:00.692
as identifying information.

464
00:20:00.692 --> 00:20:03.476
The second thing is you want your daughter

465
00:20:03.476 --> 00:20:04.446
to know that you're still here.

466
00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:07.006
You'll recount something that happened

467
00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:10.440
in the past, a frame that fell down or

468
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.720
a wedding that just occurred,

469
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.811
or a pregnancy that's about to happen

470
00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:16.083
or whatever, so you'll give this information

471
00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:18.707
about what's happened in the immediate past,

472
00:20:18.707 --> 00:20:19.709
and what's gonna happen

473
00:20:19.709 --> 00:20:22.984
in the future, and the third thing you're

474
00:20:22.984 --> 00:20:24.701
gonna do is you're gonna share

475
00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:26.322
your love and your caring

476
00:20:26.322 --> 00:20:29.501
and your advice and maybe even asking for forgiveness

477
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:30.983
about some event.

478
00:20:30.983 --> 00:20:33.857
You're gonna share that information,

479
00:20:34.439 --> 00:20:37.233
because you love this person.

480
00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:39.601
Are you gonna be talking about

481
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:41.830
the latest movie or experience you

482
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.782
had on pilates or some event

483
00:20:43.782 --> 00:20:45.596
on the other side that your daughters not

484
00:20:45.596 --> 00:20:46.739
gonna even know if it's you.

485
00:20:46.739 --> 00:20:48.915
She's not gonna have a way of verifying.

486
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:50.728
Are you gonna be giving some great insight

487
00:20:50.728 --> 00:20:51.688
about the world?

488
00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:52.840
Of course not.

489
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.165
They had a 15 year old daughter, Bailey

490
00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:57.864
who died unexpectedly in a car crash

491
00:20:57.864 --> 00:20:58.994
not far from their home.

492
00:20:58.994 --> 00:21:00.370
Their son almost died.

493
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.295
There is no greater pain or loss than losing

494
00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.831
a child that you dearly love,

495
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.447
particularly if it's sudden.

496
00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:10.610
Bob was a skeptic like me.

497
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.562
He was raised to believe it was ashes to ashes,

498
00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:14.791
dust to dust, case closed.

499
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:16.935
Fran was a little bit more open.

500
00:21:16.935 --> 00:21:19.185
They were deeply grieving,

501
00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:22.198
and they discovered the afterlife experiments book,

502
00:21:22.876 --> 00:21:25.702
and after they read this, they began to have some hope,

503
00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:26.918
and they wanted to see whether

504
00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:29.115
they could replicate in their own lives.

505
00:21:29.115 --> 00:21:30.331
They started going to mediums.

506
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.931
They started scoring information.

507
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:34.363
They even went to people like Laurie Campbell

508
00:21:34.363 --> 00:21:36.447
and other mediums that were in the book,

509
00:21:36.624 --> 00:21:39.845
and after with their own experience they could

510
00:21:39.845 --> 00:21:42.586
independently verify the reality of this

511
00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:45.247
under the kinds of circumstances,

512
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:46.927
and they came to me.

513
00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:48.549
They wanted to participate in research,

514
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:51.290
and they came to realize that what they

515
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.753
were experiencing with real information

516
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.516
it didn't eliminate the pain of missing their daughter,

517
00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:02.119
but what it did is it gave them a sense of peace.

518
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:04.071
It gave them a sense of hope.

519
00:22:04.071 --> 00:22:05.671
It gave them a sense of purpose.

520
00:22:05.671 --> 00:22:07.900
They then became open to receiving signs

521
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.681
from their daughters and so on,

522
00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:14.118
and they, in her honor, created the Forever Family

523
00:22:14.118 --> 00:22:17.275
foundation so that other families

524
00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:19.440
could have the opportunity if they wished

525
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.243
to be able to learn about the science,

526
00:22:21.243 --> 00:22:23.941
to actually experience and share

527
00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:26.559
afterlife communications

528
00:22:26.917 --> 00:22:30.256
with the goal of allowing these relationships

529
00:22:30.256 --> 00:22:32.421
to continue, and we're just actually

530
00:22:32.421 --> 00:22:34.970
finishing a book called Forever Family Calling,

531
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.420
Transforming Grief Through Afterlife Science,

532
00:22:39.962 --> 00:22:41.978
and I think of all of the various incentives

533
00:22:41.978 --> 00:22:44.553
that I have for continuing this work,

534
00:22:45.327 --> 00:22:47.675
helping families who are grieving the loss

535
00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:51.360
of their loved ones, is a very important

536
00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:52.458
component.

537
00:22:53.926 --> 00:22:56.133
<v Woman>Speaking of that very subject, one of the other</v>

538
00:22:56.133 --> 00:23:00.496
people that we have interviewed is Mark Cummings whom

539
00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:02.906
I have a tremendous amount of respect for

540
00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:05.882
as a mathematician, physicist, and a mystic in his

541
00:23:05.882 --> 00:23:07.621
own right, brilliant man,

542
00:23:07.621 --> 00:23:10.575
and his wife, Elizabeth Targ

543
00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:14.404
of the fame Dr. Russel Targ, his daughter

544
00:23:14.404 --> 00:23:16.121
passed away.

545
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.172
It's been almost a couple of years ago now

546
00:23:18.172 --> 00:23:19.723
from a brain tumor.

547
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.420
It's my understanding that,

548
00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.907
I don't know if it's one or multiple mediums

549
00:23:26.907 --> 00:23:29.019
have had contact with Elizabeth,

550
00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:31.824
and then another person whom I was familiar with

551
00:23:31.824 --> 00:23:34.406
and also admired the work of, which is Dr. John Mack

552
00:23:34.406 --> 00:23:36.144
of Harvard, head of Clinical Psychology

553
00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:39.355
at Harvard who was hit by, wasn't it a taxi in

554
00:23:39.355 --> 00:23:41.157
London last summer?

555
00:23:41.157 --> 00:23:41.829
<v ->Yes.</v>

556
00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:43.877
It was a vehicle, that's correct.

557
00:23:43.877 --> 00:23:44.944
<v ->Yes, he was there giving a presentation,</v>

558
00:23:44.944 --> 00:23:47.642
and I think it was August of 2004.

559
00:23:47.642 --> 00:23:50.917
I'm also understanding that he is coming

560
00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:52.442
through some of the mediums.

561
00:23:52.442 --> 00:23:54.490
Can you talk about this a little bit?

562
00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.343
<v ->Sure.</v>

563
00:23:55.343 --> 00:23:57.252
<v Woman>You knew Dr. Mack before.</v>

564
00:23:57.252 --> 00:24:00.617
Didn't you?
<v ->Yes, I had met John Mack</v>

565
00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:03.966
because we had been at a couple of conferences together.

566
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.777
The area that he was working in at the time,

567
00:24:06.777 --> 00:24:08.942
what he was most famous for which was

568
00:24:08.942 --> 00:24:10.681
UFOs and alien abductions.

569
00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:12.910
It's not an area that I'm working,

570
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.856
but our Harvard connection and other things.

571
00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:19.992
We came to know each other,

572
00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:24.749
and then a year ago February,

573
00:24:24.749 --> 00:24:29.749
sitting almost where I'm sitting, John came to see me

574
00:24:30.114 --> 00:24:33.133
to tell me that he had become deeply interested

575
00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:35.714
in the topic of survival of consciousness after death

576
00:24:35.714 --> 00:24:37.828
and afterlife research, and that he was writing

577
00:24:37.828 --> 00:24:41.977
a book with Mark Cummings about a biography

578
00:24:41.977 --> 00:24:45.134
of Elizabeth Targ, and also the experiences that they've

579
00:24:45.134 --> 00:24:50.083
been having with her through mediums after she died,

580
00:24:50.083 --> 00:24:52.722
and he wanted to know

581
00:24:52.846 --> 00:24:56.349
what the latest research was and did I think this was real?

582
00:24:58.168 --> 00:25:01.368
We spent over five hours in conversation

583
00:25:01.368 --> 00:25:05.314
in this very room, and I shared with John

584
00:25:05.314 --> 00:25:08.519
that I had done some secret research

585
00:25:08.887 --> 00:25:13.740
where Elizabeth Targ was one the deceased,

586
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.161
and that the research had come out

587
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:20.198
very positive, and that

588
00:25:20.364 --> 00:25:25.025
I was deeply concerned for her and for Mark,

589
00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.531
and that if there was any way that I could assist

590
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:29.601
in the completion of his book with Mark,

591
00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:32.854
including even doing an independent

592
00:25:32.854 --> 00:25:35.851
replication, double blind experiment

593
00:25:35.851 --> 00:25:37.568
to give scientific credibility to his

594
00:25:37.568 --> 00:25:42.289
more clinical observations that I was happy to do that,

595
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:46.490
and John wrote the proposal for his book.

596
00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:50.383
He actually quoted me on the cover of his proposal

597
00:25:50.698 --> 00:25:52.597
about the importance of his work,

598
00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:56.217
and then he goes off to London and he's killed.

599
00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.327
<v Woman>That was very sad.</v>

600
00:25:59.327 --> 00:26:00.675
Very.

601
00:26:01.972 --> 00:26:05.460
Because of who he was and is,

602
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.158
and because of who Elizabeth was and is

603
00:26:08.158 --> 00:26:11.821
they are unique individuals who from the other side

604
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:15.117
can not only inform us about

605
00:26:15.443 --> 00:26:17.854
transition and afterlife and so on,

606
00:26:17.854 --> 00:26:20.136
but because of who John is, we also

607
00:26:20.136 --> 00:26:21.779
now have the potential to

608
00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:25.149
discover the reality of the alien abduction

609
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:27.869
and UFO phenomena because of John's

610
00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:29.602
deep interest in this,

611
00:26:29.704 --> 00:26:31.933
and what was quite remarkable to me

612
00:26:31.933 --> 00:26:34.525
was that after he passed multiple mediums

613
00:26:34.525 --> 00:26:37.266
spontaneously called me, telling me that John

614
00:26:37.266 --> 00:26:39.585
had come through and he had messages for me.

615
00:26:39.751 --> 00:26:41.148
<v Woman>You said surely McClain did,</v>

616
00:26:41.148 --> 00:26:42.311
just very recently he had some

617
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:45.447
understanding that a John Mack was showing up

618
00:26:45.447 --> 00:26:47.691
on her psychic doorstep.

619
00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.716
John McClain was very close to John

620
00:26:50.716 --> 00:26:55.371
because of their mutual interest in UFOs.

621
00:26:55.494 --> 00:27:00.166
The irony is just a little over a week ago

622
00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:05.166
CBS News was doing a documentary for

623
00:27:05.531 --> 00:27:07.824
Art and Entertainment, a two hour special

624
00:27:07.824 --> 00:27:11.216
on mediumship and they wanted to

625
00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:14.607
include conversation with a scientist about the work

626
00:27:14.607 --> 00:27:18.298
and also they wanted to see a demonstration experiment.

627
00:27:18.298 --> 00:27:21.359
They flew out to Tuscan,

628
00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:25.540
and I arranged for a medium, Debbie Martin from Phoenix,

629
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.299
and a secret sitter to come in for

630
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:30.788
the reading.

631
00:27:30.788 --> 00:27:33.337
Debbie, like many mediums, will often

632
00:27:33.337 --> 00:27:37.427
get information before the reading begins,

633
00:27:37.753 --> 00:27:39.982
because she's open to receiving the information,

634
00:27:39.982 --> 00:27:42.147
and imagine again, you're deceased.

635
00:27:42.147 --> 00:27:43.534
You know Debbie is gonna be the medium,

636
00:27:43.534 --> 00:27:44.515
because you're hanging around,

637
00:27:44.515 --> 00:27:46.317
and you also know Debbie is willing to get information

638
00:27:46.317 --> 00:27:47.949
before the reading begins.

639
00:27:47.949 --> 00:27:50.823
You're gonna use as much as her time as you can get.

640
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.058
It's not surprising that she'll get this information.

641
00:27:55.668 --> 00:27:58.535
Debbie comes in and their filming this,

642
00:27:59.117 --> 00:28:01.228
and she's reading the first phase.

643
00:28:01.228 --> 00:28:02.626
She can't see the sitter.

644
00:28:02.626 --> 00:28:03.810
She can't speak to the sitter.

645
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.711
She's just reading into the camera what she got,

646
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:09.036
and toward the tail end before the actual

647
00:28:09.036 --> 00:28:11.798
reading where the sitters gonna be.

648
00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:12.929
She says, oh by the way Gary,

649
00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:14.139
she says.

650
00:28:14.817 --> 00:28:16.556
There were three people who came here for you,

651
00:28:16.556 --> 00:28:18.315
and they just wanted their presence known.

652
00:28:18.315 --> 00:28:20.203
One of them was Susie Smith,

653
00:28:20.203 --> 00:28:22.966
and Susie has come up in multiple readings.

654
00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:25.379
Of course I was not gonna go there.

655
00:28:25.379 --> 00:28:27.629
The second was a person by the name

656
00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:29.187
of Monteigue Keen and then she said,

657
00:28:29.187 --> 00:28:31.554
man I don't know who he is.

658
00:28:31.554 --> 00:28:33.805
His name is John, and he's an older

659
00:28:33.805 --> 00:28:35.896
gentleman, sort of tall,

660
00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:38.263
and he's standing up and he's sitting down,

661
00:28:38.263 --> 00:28:39.799
and he's standing up and he's sitting down.

662
00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:42.103
He really wants to be acknowledged.

663
00:28:42.103 --> 00:28:44.215
He says you know who he is,

664
00:28:44.215 --> 00:28:47.451
and that he just wanted you to know that he's here.

665
00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:49.665
Of course I was not about to say anything

666
00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:52.055
on this television program,

667
00:28:52.055 --> 00:28:55.841
and it was not the context in which to explore

668
00:28:55.841 --> 00:28:58.305
was this who I thought it was?

669
00:28:58.305 --> 00:29:00.161
But it very much sounded like

670
00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:03.456
was consistent with John Mack

671
00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:05.451
who has been showing up with other research mediums

672
00:29:05.451 --> 00:29:07.595
and given the fact that I was also gonna

673
00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:10.656
be having a conversation with John McClain.

674
00:29:10.656 --> 00:29:14.650
These things are really unfolding.

675
00:29:14.794 --> 00:29:17.525
Of course, the scientist is gonna say,

676
00:29:17.525 --> 00:29:20.266
well how do you know fraud is not involved?

677
00:29:20.266 --> 00:29:21.823
How do you know the cold reading is not involved?

678
00:29:21.823 --> 00:29:23.359
How do you know that you're

679
00:29:23.359 --> 00:29:26.911
not just selectively looking at this information,

680
00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:28.447
looking at the shots taking

681
00:29:28.447 --> 00:29:30.676
it in and ignoring the misses and so on

682
00:29:30.676 --> 00:29:31.487
and so forth,

683
00:29:31.487 --> 00:29:33.262
and my response to that is

684
00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:35.988
that is the bread and butter of what we do.

685
00:29:35.988 --> 00:29:38.004
That is so fundamental that we do this

686
00:29:38.004 --> 00:29:40.265
over and over.

687
00:29:40.265 --> 00:29:41.395
That's where we start from.

688
00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:43.902
You have to rule out all of that

689
00:29:43.902 --> 00:29:46.558
before we rule in the survival.

690
00:29:46.558 --> 00:29:49.288
<v Woman>83% accuracy isn't a fluke either, is it?</v>

691
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:52.285
<v ->83% accuracy is not at all a fluke.</v>

692
00:29:52.285 --> 00:29:55.123
In this demonstration experiment that Debbie did,

693
00:29:55.123 --> 00:29:59.784
the sitter estimated that she was 93% accurate,

694
00:29:59.784 --> 00:30:02.621
and then after while they were interviewing me,

695
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:04.775
and she and the sitter had a chance to privately

696
00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:07.708
compare notes it turned out that some of the information

697
00:30:07.708 --> 00:30:10.450
that the sitter didn't understand on later reflection

698
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.041
turned out to fit her grandmother precisely

699
00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:16.039
and she went up to 80, 97 or 98%.

700
00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:17.990
Sometimes mediums are

701
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.355
close to perfect.

702
00:30:21.446 --> 00:30:22.838
It's quite remarkable.

703
00:30:23.846 --> 00:30:26.715
<v Woman>Tell me then what is the difference between</v>

704
00:30:26.715 --> 00:30:28.699
for example, if they're reading,

705
00:30:28.699 --> 00:30:32.213
say it's your grandmother,

706
00:30:32.272 --> 00:30:35.291
and you have these common experiences,

707
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:39.098
and you have heard basically in your memory,

708
00:30:39.098 --> 00:30:41.584
your love, your heart, your aura, etcetera,

709
00:30:41.584 --> 00:30:43.226
and the experiences you've had together,

710
00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:46.319
what is the difference between being able to

711
00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:48.455
go into your aura and pluck this

712
00:30:48.455 --> 00:30:50.194
information out versus

713
00:30:50.194 --> 00:30:51.516
what you're talking about?

714
00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:56.516
<v ->If the medium was going into my aura and plucking</v>

715
00:30:56.999 --> 00:30:59.366
the information out, what she'd be doing

716
00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:01.222
is first of all giving me the information that's

717
00:31:01.222 --> 00:31:03.520
most prominent in my mind.

718
00:31:03.526 --> 00:31:04.913
She would be feeding back

719
00:31:04.913 --> 00:31:08.817
what I'm looking for, the answers that I'm searching for,

720
00:31:08.817 --> 00:31:11.440
and 95% of the time what the mediums

721
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.435
give you is not what you're thinking.

722
00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:15.664
95% of the time you're screaming,

723
00:31:15.664 --> 00:31:18.469
for example, there was a car crash!

724
00:31:18.469 --> 00:31:20.069
There was a car crash, and

725
00:31:20.069 --> 00:31:21.530
she's not getting car crash.

726
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.642
She's somewhere else, or she's

727
00:31:23.642 --> 00:31:25.434
giving you other details,

728
00:31:25.434 --> 00:31:27.194
or she's saying well I'm seeing a lot of blood,

729
00:31:27.194 --> 00:31:28.773
and you're thinking car crash.

730
00:31:28.773 --> 00:31:29.354
You're seeing car crash.

731
00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:30.691
She doesn't see it.

732
00:31:30.815 --> 00:31:33.343
The first thing is is that what is being

733
00:31:33.343 --> 00:31:35.529
received is not what you're thinking.

734
00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:40.308
Secondly, very often, the information that's received

735
00:31:40.308 --> 00:31:42.947
is information you're not even aware of.

736
00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:46.323
You don't know until after you've left a reading

737
00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:50.824
and you checked with your sister or your mother or whomever,

738
00:31:50.824 --> 00:31:54.963
you discover that the information was correct,

739
00:31:54.963 --> 00:31:56.701
but you wouldn't have that information.

740
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:59.442
Not only is she not giving you what you're

741
00:31:59.442 --> 00:32:01.650
wanting to hear or expecting to hear,

742
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.346
but she's giving you information

743
00:32:03.346 --> 00:32:05.452
that you don't know.

744
00:32:05.458 --> 00:32:07.175
You therefore have to hypothesize, well if she's somehow

745
00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:10.887
still reading people's minds or auras, she's somehow

746
00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:12.999
managing to ignore yours

747
00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:16.231
and find some other person whose not there

748
00:32:16.231 --> 00:32:18.182
to get this information from.

749
00:32:18.182 --> 00:32:21.222
Of course that's still in principle possible,

750
00:32:21.222 --> 00:32:24.373
it's just not terribly probable.

751
00:32:25.489 --> 00:32:27.558
The third thing is is that

752
00:32:27.558 --> 00:32:32.558
the information often acts like it's alive

753
00:32:33.499 --> 00:32:38.235
particularly if the sitter can ask questions

754
00:32:38.235 --> 00:32:39.445
of the medium.

755
00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:41.978
I'll never forget when this was

756
00:32:41.978 --> 00:32:45.669
really taught to me by a particular

757
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:48.175
deceased person with a particular medium

758
00:32:48.175 --> 00:32:51.012
where I would ask a question of the medium

759
00:32:51.012 --> 00:32:53.818
about a particular event

760
00:32:53.818 --> 00:32:56.857
or a particular piece of information

761
00:32:56.857 --> 00:32:59.183
I'm searching for, and while I'm asking

762
00:32:59.183 --> 00:33:00.878
the question

763
00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:04.729
she interrupts me with information

764
00:33:04.729 --> 00:33:07.822
from the deceased, which I'm not thinking about

765
00:33:07.822 --> 00:33:10.169
at all, which I don't even know that I wanna hear,

766
00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:14.706
and this information turns out to be highly evidential.

767
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.016
What the deceased is doing is

768
00:33:17.016 --> 00:33:21.475
asserting himself or herself into the process.

769
00:33:21.475 --> 00:33:25.276
It's very much like normal communication,

770
00:33:25.464 --> 00:33:27.943
and just like we could interrupt each other,

771
00:33:28.087 --> 00:33:30.449
they interrupt us,

772
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.642
and there are multiple ways in which

773
00:33:32.642 --> 00:33:37.468
the deceased act in ways which

774
00:33:38.028 --> 00:33:41.894
they look like and act like they're alive.

775
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.620
At some point if it walks like a duck,

776
00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.129
sounds like a duck, and it smells like duck and so on

777
00:33:48.129 --> 00:33:50.731
and at some point you say well it's probably a duck,

778
00:33:50.731 --> 00:33:53.675
and that's how this, that's why you end up

779
00:33:53.675 --> 00:33:57.664
being led to the conclusion that the most plausible

780
00:33:57.664 --> 00:34:00.399
explanation really is survival of consciousness.

781
00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:05.194
<v Woman>Have you gotten any specific information</v>

782
00:34:05.194 --> 00:34:08.512
via Dr. Mack or any of the others that you're speaking

783
00:34:08.512 --> 00:34:11.903
to through mediums about the nature of transition.

784
00:34:11.903 --> 00:34:13.802
We've also interviewed Danun Brinkley,

785
00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:15.103
and he talks at length about

786
00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:18.143
what it's like to transition and come back

787
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:20.586
in his case on multiple occasions.

788
00:34:20.586 --> 00:34:21.492
<v ->Right.</v>

789
00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:22.857
<v Woman>Have you gotten information from those</v>

790
00:34:22.857 --> 00:34:24.745
who have completely transitioned?

791
00:34:24.745 --> 00:34:28.436
<v ->Up to now, our research has mostly focused on</v>

792
00:34:28.436 --> 00:34:29.481
the question,

793
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:31.710
is there an afterlife?

794
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.121
We've not scientifically allowed ourselves

795
00:34:34.121 --> 00:34:37.331
to ask the question, what is the afterlife like

796
00:34:37.331 --> 00:34:39.720
including the process of transition.

797
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.685
There are all kinds of anecdotal if you would,

798
00:34:42.685 --> 00:34:45.640
uncontrolled pieces of information that comes through,

799
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.381
but nothing that we've done systematically.

800
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:50.920
We've just started within the past year

801
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.213
doing what we're calling the asking questions

802
00:34:53.213 --> 00:34:57.191
experiment where we're now addressing this scientifically,

803
00:34:57.191 --> 00:34:58.806
and this is the way we do it.

804
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.415
We have multiple mediums

805
00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:05.479
read sitters blindly, because they don't know

806
00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:07.627
who the sitter is, and

807
00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:12.252
after the, and they're given a name like Robert.

808
00:35:12.252 --> 00:35:15.366
There are millions of deceased Roberts.

809
00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:17.019
That doesn't help you a lot, but at least

810
00:35:17.019 --> 00:35:18.822
you know it's a male and it has that name,

811
00:35:18.822 --> 00:35:20.752
and then what we do is we ask the medium

812
00:35:20.752 --> 00:35:23.142
a series of life questions.

813
00:35:23.142 --> 00:35:24.379
What does Robert look like?

814
00:35:24.379 --> 00:35:25.605
What were Robert's hobbies?

815
00:35:25.605 --> 00:35:26.864
How did Robert die?

816
00:35:26.864 --> 00:35:28.304
What's Robert's favorite food?

817
00:35:28.304 --> 00:35:29.339
So on and so forth.

818
00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:33.242
Information that the sitter can verify

819
00:35:33.242 --> 00:35:34.544
as fitting Robert.

820
00:35:34.544 --> 00:35:37.541
Let's say that a given medium contacts Robert,

821
00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:39.983
and she gets accurate information,

822
00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:42.234
which as you know you could probably guess

823
00:35:42.234 --> 00:35:44.580
is more often the case than not.

824
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.235
Then what we do is we ask a series of afterlife questions

825
00:35:49.913 --> 00:35:53.049
such as what was your transition like?

826
00:35:53.049 --> 00:35:53.998
What are you doing now?

827
00:35:53.998 --> 00:35:55.097
Do you experience time?

828
00:35:55.097 --> 00:35:55.769
Do you sleep?

829
00:35:55.769 --> 00:35:58.649
What do you do on a typical day,

830
00:35:58.649 --> 00:35:59.385
so on and so forth,

831
00:35:59.385 --> 00:36:02.770
a series of 38 afterlife questions,

832
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.094
and what we do is we ask these 38 questions

833
00:36:06.094 --> 00:36:10.066
of different mediums for a given deceased person,

834
00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:12.227
and to the extent that the medium

835
00:36:12.227 --> 00:36:13.346
is getting accurate information

836
00:36:13.346 --> 00:36:14.983
about the life questions,

837
00:36:15.202 --> 00:36:18.242
and she's giving replicated information

838
00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:21.538
about things that uniquely fits a given deceased

839
00:36:21.538 --> 00:36:22.999
person in the afterlife.

840
00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:25.282
We can then have some

841
00:36:25.282 --> 00:36:29.548
reason to conclude that what the medium is getting

842
00:36:29.548 --> 00:36:31.895
and giving us is not her biases

843
00:36:31.895 --> 00:36:34.446
or beliefs about the afterlife,

844
00:36:34.446 --> 00:36:38.467
but what she's actually receiving from the deceased.

845
00:36:38.467 --> 00:36:42.365
That work is now ongoing,

846
00:36:42.509 --> 00:36:44.760
and we're just in the process.

847
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.645
<v Woman>Any early hits?</v>

848
00:36:45.645 --> 00:36:49.005
<v ->Well there are certain things that sort of come through.</v>

849
00:36:49.005 --> 00:36:51.004
One of the things is that

850
00:36:51.256 --> 00:36:54.626
the universal, the deceased report

851
00:36:54.626 --> 00:36:56.877
that travels a piece of cake.

852
00:36:56.877 --> 00:37:01.548
That distance is not a problem.

853
00:37:01.548 --> 00:37:04.801
Travel can be just a thought away.

854
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:07.116
The second thing is that it appears

855
00:37:07.116 --> 00:37:08.929
that it's much easier to multi task

856
00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:10.203
on the other side.

857
00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:14.219
For example, I could be here in this interview right now

858
00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:16.662
but I can simultaneously be remembering

859
00:37:16.662 --> 00:37:20.726
my recent trip to Talas which was last

860
00:37:20.726 --> 00:37:23.072
week and to Santa Fe, and so I can see myself

861
00:37:23.072 --> 00:37:24.811
for example, walking into Talas,

862
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:28.261
having a meeting at the state department and so on.

863
00:37:28.459 --> 00:37:31.541
I can't do both of those at the same time,

864
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:32.842
even though I can be thinking about

865
00:37:32.842 --> 00:37:34.986
and imaging both of these things at the same time.

866
00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.671
Apparently when you're deceased

867
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:37.967
you can.

868
00:37:38.005 --> 00:37:42.570
You can be in Talas and be in Tucson

869
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.727
at the same time and parallel process in a way

870
00:37:45.727 --> 00:37:47.871
that is more effective.

871
00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:53.396
Apparently there are a number of pluses to shedding

872
00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:55.011
one's physical body.

873
00:37:56.627 --> 00:37:58.089
<v Woman>Anything else on that line</v>

874
00:37:58.089 --> 00:37:59.134
you'd like to share?

875
00:37:59.134 --> 00:38:00.382
That's a cheesy little grin.

876
00:38:02.222 --> 00:38:04.664
<v ->I sometimes refer to these people as post physical.</v>

877
00:38:04.766 --> 00:38:07.197
The post physical.

878
00:38:07.197 --> 00:38:07.880
We're the physicals.

879
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.591
They're the post physicals.

880
00:38:10.387 --> 00:38:13.917
Dr. Julie Barshell was as post doctoral fellow

881
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:16.328
whom collaborates with me on this research.

882
00:38:16.328 --> 00:38:17.906
She sometimes refers to the deceased

883
00:38:17.906 --> 00:38:20.684
as the physically challenged,

884
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:24.828
and very often with the deceased who are actively

885
00:38:24.828 --> 00:38:27.314
collaborating on research, including what we call

886
00:38:27.314 --> 00:38:29.287
the double deceased paradigm.

887
00:38:29.287 --> 00:38:33.600
We refer to them when we put on our scientific jargon.

888
00:38:33.788 --> 00:38:37.297
We refer to them as departed hypothesized co-investigators.

889
00:38:38.947 --> 00:38:40.459
<v Woman>Sounds credible.</v>

890
00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:43.360
<v ->It does have a ring of credibility to it.</v>

891
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:46.918
<v Woman>With all of this, what do they say about you</v>

892
00:38:46.918 --> 00:38:50.111
at Yale these days and at your home university?

893
00:38:50.235 --> 00:38:52.400
Are you still thought to be a little far out

894
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.386
and cooky or are you getting some validation now?

895
00:38:55.386 --> 00:38:57.983
<v ->It's interesting there are sort of three camps.</v>

896
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:01.353
There are one group of faculty who

897
00:39:02.245 --> 00:39:03.653
think the work is fantastic.

898
00:39:03.653 --> 00:39:05.790
They think it's revolutionary.

899
00:39:05.818 --> 00:39:07.369
They think it's

900
00:39:08.068 --> 00:39:10.116
very critical

901
00:39:10.116 --> 00:39:11.876
for the evolution of the species.

902
00:39:11.876 --> 00:39:14.596
They encourage me to go forward as long

903
00:39:14.596 --> 00:39:16.846
as we do so with utmost care,

904
00:39:16.846 --> 00:39:19.140
and caution and so on.

905
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.280
There's a second group of people who

906
00:39:22.563 --> 00:39:25.277
don't like to talk about it in public,

907
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.771
but behind closed doors they will say

908
00:39:28.771 --> 00:39:31.043
to me things like I'm really glad you're

909
00:39:31.043 --> 00:39:32.067
doing this work.

910
00:39:32.067 --> 00:39:33.709
I wouldn't be interested in doing this.

911
00:39:33.709 --> 00:39:35.171
I wouldn't be brave enough to do this,

912
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:36.760
but I'm glad you're doing it,

913
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.684
and we hope it comes out positive,

914
00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:40.824
and then there's a third group,

915
00:39:40.824 --> 00:39:42.914
and these people think that you've gotta be

916
00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:44.535
crazy to do this research.

917
00:39:46.165 --> 00:39:49.857
It's impossible that survival of the conscious can be true,

918
00:39:49.885 --> 00:39:53.437
that the mediums are somehow fooling me,

919
00:39:53.437 --> 00:39:56.338
that the wool is being pulled over my eyes

920
00:39:56.635 --> 00:39:58.214
Mr. James Randy sometimes refers

921
00:39:58.214 --> 00:40:00.331
to me as gullible Gary.

922
00:40:00.337 --> 00:40:01.051
<v Woman>The famous Randy.</v>

923
00:40:01.051 --> 00:40:03.355
<v ->The famous Randy, the amazing Randy, exactly.</v>

924
00:40:03.355 --> 00:40:07.248
And they feel that you have to be either

925
00:40:07.248 --> 00:40:10.480
crazy or diluted or cheating yourself

926
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.986
to be getting these kinds of results,

927
00:40:12.986 --> 00:40:15.248
and so all three

928
00:40:15.248 --> 00:40:19.514
opinions are present.

929
00:40:19.514 --> 00:40:23.295
What I do is I

930
00:40:23.652 --> 00:40:27.657
live with the totality of people's opinions.

931
00:40:27.802 --> 00:40:29.615
People ask me, they say Gary are you trying

932
00:40:29.615 --> 00:40:31.545
to prove survival of consciousness?

933
00:40:31.545 --> 00:40:33.049
I say absolutely not.

934
00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:35.438
What I'm trying to do is to live survival of consciousness

935
00:40:35.438 --> 00:40:37.977
the opportunity to prove itself.

936
00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:39.758
The motto of our lab is if it's real

937
00:40:39.758 --> 00:40:41.134
it will be revealed,

938
00:40:41.134 --> 00:40:43.427
and if it's fake we'll find a mistake.

939
00:40:43.427 --> 00:40:47.096
Although the skeptical colleagues

940
00:40:47.096 --> 00:40:50.461
don't really understand this about me.

941
00:40:51.117 --> 00:40:53.528
I'm really concerned with truth,

942
00:40:53.528 --> 00:40:54.296
with veritas.

943
00:40:54.296 --> 00:40:56.365
In fact our research program is titled

944
00:40:56.365 --> 00:40:57.986
the veritas research program,

945
00:40:57.986 --> 00:41:00.823
and our website is veritas.arizona.edu,

946
00:41:00.823 --> 00:41:03.255
and veritas is Latin.

947
00:41:03.255 --> 00:41:05.229
It's Harvard's motto which means truth,

948
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:07.202
and Yale's motto is luxa veritas which

949
00:41:07.202 --> 00:41:08.322
is light and truth.

950
00:41:08.322 --> 00:41:12.684
We're just following where the data are,

951
00:41:12.684 --> 00:41:14.316
and if it turns out that there

952
00:41:14.316 --> 00:41:15.820
was time used to think

953
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.558
the earth was flat and then we discovered it was round.

954
00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:19.233
People thought you were crazy,

955
00:41:19.233 --> 00:41:21.398
Columbus was crazy to make the trip,

956
00:41:21.398 --> 00:41:23.926
or we used to think the sun revolved around the earth.

957
00:41:23.926 --> 00:41:25.825
Now we know it's the other way around,

958
00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:28.843
and Copernicus was laughed at as with Gallelio

959
00:41:28.843 --> 00:41:30.955
or we used to think objects were solid.

960
00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:34.880
Now we know they're mostly empty space and so on.

961
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.762
The history of science over and over tells us there

962
00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:41.333
are moments where this paradigm changes.

963
00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:42.314
There are moments when we

964
00:41:42.314 --> 00:41:45.354
really have to change our minds about the

965
00:41:45.354 --> 00:41:47.189
way we view the world.

966
00:41:47.189 --> 00:41:52.180
If that's part of the history of

967
00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.708
science and if it comes with the territory,

968
00:41:54.708 --> 00:41:59.075
you know, endure it the best you can.

969
00:42:02.324 --> 00:42:03.785
<v ->If you want to take a look at the subject</v>

970
00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:06.878
of life beyond life from an entirely different angle,

971
00:42:06.878 --> 00:42:08.414
you'll likely enjoy our interviews with

972
00:42:08.414 --> 00:42:10.760
Danon Brinkley who died for 28

973
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.683
minutes and tells about the journey to the other side,

974
00:42:13.683 --> 00:42:15.976
and our interview with Dr. Mitchell Gibson,

975
00:42:15.976 --> 00:42:19.304
a psychiatrist who has seen and communicated

976
00:42:19.304 --> 00:42:21.458
with those who have passed over.

977
00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:23.682
Until next time, thanks for watching.
