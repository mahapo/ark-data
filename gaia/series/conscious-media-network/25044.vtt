00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.301
<v ->While at the Science and Consciousness Conference</v>

2
00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:04.190
in Santa Fe, we were able to catch up with

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.790
one of our favorite interviewees, Dr. John Demartini.

4
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.530
In this interview, John pulls no

5
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.010
punches on the subject of true love.

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.730
In his new book, "The Heart of Love -

7
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.690
"How to Go Beyond Fantasy to Find

8
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.850
"True Relationship Fulfillment",

9
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.110
John sorts through the difference

10
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.030
between infatuation and unrealistic

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.990
expectations and genuine partnership.

12
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.730
In the end, he says, "True love is

13
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.701
"about balance - the dance between the dark and the light."

14
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:34.701
(relaxing music)

15
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:39.891
<v Voiceover>Thank you again for joining us.</v>

16
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.971
Second round here; we're talking about

17
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:44.151
the heart of love, and we're talking

18
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.571
about a kind of love that takes us

19
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.631
beyond all of our "Cinderella and Prince Charming" fantasies

20
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:52.591
which certainly, I think, maybe every

21
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.231
culture in the world has a degree

22
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.651
of that kind of fantasy embedded in love,

23
00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:58.671
some more than others; in the West

24
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:00.731
I'd say maybe quite a lot, certainly the

25
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:03.211
United States, we were raised on fairy tales.

26
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:05.051
<v ->We definitely live in a world of fantasies here.</v>

27
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:06.171
<v Voiceover>(laughs) We do. So,</v>

28
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.151
let's launch into why you felt it

29
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:10.991
necessary to write this book to begin with.

30
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.071
You have so many beautiful books out there.

31
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:15.431
<v ->Well because I watch people have</v>

32
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:17.671
unrealistic expectations on other people

33
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:19.491
that they're in relationship with,

34
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:20.851
and they set themselves up for

35
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.671
the broken heart, they set themselves

36
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:25.071
up for feelings of betrayal, they

37
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:27.471
set themselves up for, they have

38
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.532
false expectations on what a relationship's about.

39
00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:32.451
And I keep seeing that, and so I put together

40
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.211
the book to try to address that concern,

41
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.491
and I really believe it will help people.

42
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:38.671
"The Heart of Love" will help people

43
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.191
set real objectives in relationships.

44
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.831
So their relationships have potential

45
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.721
for lasting if they want it to last.

46
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:45.591
<v Voiceover>Well, and this is something</v>

47
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.811
that's critical to most of us,

48
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:49.371
with the divorce rate as high as it is.

49
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:51.831
Obviously, we're all operating under illusion,

50
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:54.771
delusion, and fairy tale expectations to some extent.

51
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.651
<v ->Yeah, I would like to have an</v>

52
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:57.991
outline of a few of the fantasies.

53
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.271
I have some fantasies is this lip labeled in the book,

54
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.631
"Heart of Love", but I'd like to

55
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:04.631
talk about the fantasies for a

56
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.191
second 'cause I think it's pertinent.

57
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.191
Every human being has a set of values,

58
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:12.311
and whatever's highest in their value,

59
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:15.191
they have discipline, order, they have focus,

60
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:17.431
they have reliability, they think about

61
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.351
things along those lines, and whatever's

62
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:20.911
lowest on their value is where they

63
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:25.551
hesitate, procrastinate, in a sense, live in a frustration.

64
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.531
That's where their chaos is, so they have

65
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.731
higher order in the things that are higher values,

66
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:32.571
and lower order in the things that are lower in the values.

67
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.211
If a husband and wife with two different

68
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:38.191
sets of values walk in a mall, and she has as

69
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.151
her highest values her children, her children's

70
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.831
education, children's clothes, et cetera, and he has

71
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:46.111
his business and finance and things of this nature.

72
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.191
Then what'll happen is as she walks through the mall,

73
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:50.991
she will notice things relating to children,

74
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.081
and she will act upon those things, those

75
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:55.021
opportunities relating to children, and she'll make

76
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.021
decisions accordingly to those highest values.

77
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.821
Anything that supports her highest values

78
00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:01.181
she gets alive to, wakes up to.

79
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.781
And it has what I call " attention surplus order."

80
00:03:03.781 --> 00:03:06.621
While he, at the same time, if he's in a children's store,

81
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:08.621
he'll end up with "attention deficit disorder."

82
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.901
'Cause he'll shut down, and he'll wanna go

83
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.901
sit outside and just wait for her to finish shopping.

84
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.181
When he goes into a business store,

85
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:17.681
now he livens up and she'll shut down.

86
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:19.541
I think that's the universe brought

87
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.591
Starbucks to the malls, to keep them both awake.

88
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:24.161
<v Voiceover>(laughs) To keep 'em both awake,</v>

89
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:25.041
and give them somewhere to go while

90
00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:26.481
the other one is checked out.

91
00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:29.121
<v ->Okay, so what happens is, what we</v>

92
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:32.421
see in the world, what we observe with our senses,

93
00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.521
what we act upon in our motor function,

94
00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:36.401
and what our decisions are, are based on

95
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.201
what's highest in our values, and based on

96
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.161
what we think will support our values most.

97
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:41.701
All decisions are based on what

98
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.861
we think is gonna give us the most

99
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.981
advantages over disadvantages at any one moment in our life.

100
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.701
Now, once we have that understood,

101
00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.241
we realize that the only thing you could ever

102
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.241
expect another human being to do

103
00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:55.161
is to live according to those values,

104
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:56.101
'cause that's how they're seeing the

105
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.341
world act upon the world, et cetera.

106
00:03:58.341 --> 00:03:59.521
Now, because no two people ever

107
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:02.722
have exactly the same values, then

108
00:04:02.722 --> 00:04:03.842
no two people can ever see the

109
00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.782
world the same way or act upon the world.

110
00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:07.541
What's interesting, the purpose of marriage

111
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.061
is to prepare you for attracting into your life

112
00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:13.301
somebody who's kind of like your complimentary opposite.

113
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.421
So what happens is that you get a man,

114
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.961
who's got the highest values of, say, business

115
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:18.461
and finance, and maybe he gets a wife

116
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.301
who's focused on the kids, and what's

117
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.641
lower on his values is higher on hers,

118
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:24.821
and what's lower on hers is higher in his.

119
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:26.381
And so, he basically marries somebody

120
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:29.842
that is his disowned parts, the parts he doesn't focus on.

121
00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:33.921
And, he basically hires somebody, or marries somebody,

122
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:36.342
to do the things he doesn't really want to do.

123
00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.361
And she does the same, so the purpose

124
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.821
of marriage is to attract somebody

125
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.421
that's basically unimportant to you,

126
00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:42.821
so you can delegate the stuff you

127
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.361
don't really wanna do; kinda funny.

128
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:46.981
I'm joking a little bit but not a lot.

129
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:47.921
<v Voiceover>Not a lot.</v>

130
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.342
<v ->And I always say there's somebody</v>

131
00:04:49.342 --> 00:04:51.601
in the world that's exactly your opposite,

132
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:55.201
and so marriage is to prepare you to meet that person.

133
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:59.001
And what's interesting is, any time one person

134
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:01.961
expects the other person to be more like them,

135
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:04.361
and vice versa, this person expects them to be

136
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.662
more like themselves, you got a clash.

137
00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:09.261
Because if any two people are exactly the same,

138
00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:11.021
one would not be necessary for one,

139
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:13.201
and the purpose of the relationship,

140
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:15.641
believe it or not, is to teach each individual in the

141
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:19.101
relationship how to own the parts they're not owning it,

142
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.782
and how to love the parts they're not lovin',

143
00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:23.201
and how to embrace the things that

144
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.401
are right now lower on the values.

145
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:30.021
So, we bring into our life, in a marriage, or in a

146
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:33.401
relationship, the things that we have not wanting to face.

147
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.641
Now, what's interesting is if you get

148
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:36.701
two people that have things lower

149
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:38.241
in their values and they get married

150
00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:40.541
and they have kids, the kids specialize

151
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.981
in the things that both of them repress.

152
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:45.281
So, genetically, we code our kids to

153
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:47.101
make sure that they specialize

154
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.301
and target all of our repressions.

155
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:52.681
So I always say that whatever we repress, they express.

156
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:53.621
That's why I try to have as much

157
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.021
sex as I possibly can to make sure,

158
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.461
it's for the sake of my kids, they

159
00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:58.221
don't have to be the ones repressing it.

160
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.721
That's s'posed to be funny though.

161
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.761
So what happens is we literally

162
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.221
are learning how to love our whole self,

163
00:06:05.221 --> 00:06:08.501
and we attract into ourselves relationships.

164
00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.521
And that may not be just in our close relationship;

165
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:15.131
it could be our people at work, our clients, our customers,

166
00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:17.521
our social friends, our kids, et cetera.

167
00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:19.381
We're constantly drawing in things that

168
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:22.501
help us learn to love our whole being.

169
00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:23.741
<v Voiceover>That's interesting you should say that,</v>

170
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:25.981
because that means there is no escaping,

171
00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:27.721
I'm glad you brought the other part in,

172
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.461
because you can, say, leave the husband,

173
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:32.561
but you take the kids, well you still

174
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:34.441
have your little mirrors all around you.

175
00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:36.121
<v ->Well that's the thing, they're all mirrors,</v>

176
00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:37.501
and what's interesting is even if you

177
00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:39.341
got rid of the husband, which some people do,

178
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:41.501
you'd immediately attract, nothing ever

179
00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.121
gets missing, it just changes form.

180
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:44.981
You immediately attract another

181
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:46.321
girlfriend's husband that starts

182
00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:47.741
picking up some of those traits,

183
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.181
the son or the daughter picks up some of the traits,

184
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.841
you take on some of the traits,

185
00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:54.161
or some friend at work or some client at work picks up

186
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:57.321
the traits, so you never escape what you haven't loved.

187
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.161
You are forced to face and love that which you

188
00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:03.321
haven't loved, to teach you the master of love.

189
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:05.221
<v Voiceover>So this is a basic resonance issue.</v>

190
00:07:05.221 --> 00:07:08.221
<v ->It's a resonation, and what's interesting is</v>

191
00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:10.501
that the more you love it, and when you finally

192
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:12.021
love people for who they are, they

193
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.701
turn into who you love, and that's what we all want.

194
00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:16.721
See, I've asked people around the world,

195
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:18.201
"If you only had 24 hours to live,

196
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.741
"what would you do with your life?"

197
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:25.681
And people across the board, 99.999% of

198
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:27.541
all people, except for occasional tricksters,

199
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:29.361
they will share their love and appreciation

200
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.501
for people who have contributed to their life.

201
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:32.561
So that means if they get down to

202
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:34.341
the last minute of their life,

203
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.181
the most important thing is gratitude and love.

204
00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:37.501
If I asked people how many wanna be

205
00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.001
appreciated and loved for who they are,

206
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:40.401
everybody puts their hand up,

207
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:42.161
so gratitude and love is like the cornerstone

208
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:46.061
of our existence; that's like the essence of our existence.

209
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:47.801
<v Voiceover>You have a deep practice of gratitude,</v>

210
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.541
if I can interject that, don't you?

211
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:50.701
After you finish this, maybe share

212
00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:53.742
what you do, how you personally--
<v ->Well what I do every day is</v>

213
00:07:53.742 --> 00:07:55.641
every day, every night, I document

214
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.781
what I'm grateful for for that day,

215
00:07:57.781 --> 00:07:59.761
and I've been doing that since I was 17.

216
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:02.921
So I'm almost 53 now, so I've been doing it a long time,

217
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:04.001
and I got probably the largest collection

218
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:06.001
of gratitudes of probably anybody I've ever met,

219
00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:08.621
because I found that I learned that

220
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:09.742
from my mother when I was four,

221
00:08:09.742 --> 00:08:11.821
but I didn't listen to her 'til I was 17.

222
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:13.801
That is those that count their blessings

223
00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:16.701
and are grateful for life, they get more to be grateful for.

224
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:18.001
And I have a really amazing and abundant

225
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:19.941
life today because of it, so yeah,

226
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.541
I keep record of that, and I find that

227
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:24.541
when you're grateful for people for who they are,

228
00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:26.701
they turn into who you love, that's the secret.

229
00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:28.362
<v Voiceover>Now that is the really important part,</v>

230
00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:30.461
because the charge is gone, the negative charge

231
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:33.921
that may have been there for you is dissipated

232
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.141
through your acceptance you're transformed.
<v ->But not just the negative one --</v>

233
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:39.041
<v Voiceover>And the positive.</v>

234
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:41.561
<v ->Because, see, if you're infatuated with somebody,</v>

235
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:43.041
you've got them on a pedestal.

236
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.661
What you'll do is you'll tend to inject their values

237
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:48.221
into your life; you'll try to be somebody you're not.

238
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:50.801
You'll tend to sacrifice for them.

239
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.021
You'll minimize yourself; you'll be the doormat.

240
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:54.421
And what you're doing is you're holding on

241
00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:56.141
in your memory, everything that you've

242
00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:57.801
done and sacrifices them and you're

243
00:08:57.801 --> 00:08:59.661
holding onto it, 'cause no intel chip

244
00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:01.482
can remember what a woman remembers

245
00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:04.181
or a man remembers what they had to do for the person,

246
00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:07.721
and Microsoft's trying to buy that from a woman's brain,

247
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.201
I'm joking, but what happens, you remember those things

248
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.021
that you sacrifice and you minimize yourself,

249
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:15.862
and then you wonder why they don't live up to your fantasy,

250
00:09:15.862 --> 00:09:17.261
because you've put a fantasy on them.

251
00:09:17.261 --> 00:09:18.362
<v Voiceover>Well, you haven't lived up to your own.</v>

252
00:09:18.362 --> 00:09:19.201
<v ->You haven't lived up to your own;</v>

253
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.362
you're minimizing yourself, so,

254
00:09:20.362 --> 00:09:22.701
you're not here to minimize yourself

255
00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:24.881
and exaggerate others, and you're not here to

256
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:27.501
exaggerate yourself and minimize others.

257
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:29.901
Nobody's worth putting on pedestals or put in pits,

258
00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:32.701
but everybody's worth putting in heart.

259
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:34.081
And the essence is putting in heart,

260
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.661
but you can't do that unless you're grateful,

261
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:37.321
and you can't do that as long as you're

262
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.581
minimizing yourself and exaggerating them,

263
00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:40.701
'cause then you're too humble to admit

264
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:42.021
you have the trait you see in them,

265
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:45.621
and you're not owning reflectively what you see in them.

266
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:46.761
The seer, the seeing, and the seen

267
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.161
must always be the same if you wanna open the heart.

268
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:51.102
And the same time, you're sometimes too proud

269
00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:53.862
to admit you have the negative traits you despise in them,

270
00:09:53.862 --> 00:09:55.081
and so what you do, then you wanna

271
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.221
change them relative to you; whenever you

272
00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:58.721
wanna change you relative to others

273
00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:01.841
or others relative to you, you're not grateful for what is.

274
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:02.742
And when you're not grateful for

275
00:10:02.742 --> 00:10:04.602
what is, your heart shuts down,

276
00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:06.121
and then you don't have love, and then

277
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:08.321
you're wanting to fix you or them all the time.

278
00:10:08.321 --> 00:10:10.321
And that's all that energy dissipated,

279
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:13.181
instead of love, and when you go and

280
00:10:13.181 --> 00:10:14.461
realize that what you see in them

281
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.921
is really you, we're all mirrors,

282
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:17.321
we're reflections, and there's

283
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:20.321
nothing to fix, it's just something to appreciate.

284
00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:21.621
Magic occurs, and relationships

285
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.881
really unfold and amazing things

286
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:24.901
emerge when that is going on.

287
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:26.521
In my book, "The Heart of Love",

288
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.161
I teach people the science of that;

289
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.781
how to ask questions that bring

290
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:33.401
balance to the mind, in the Demartini method,

291
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:35.201
and allows people to appreciate

292
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.441
and love people that they may have

293
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:39.141
difficulty loving, or even themselves.

294
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:41.982
<v Voiceover>So, this brings us to duality,</v>

295
00:10:41.982 --> 00:10:43.362
the duality in our own natures,

296
00:10:43.362 --> 00:10:45.141
and why we have such a difficult time

297
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.261
accepting that we're not all perfect,

298
00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:48.602
and then beating ourself up the

299
00:10:48.602 --> 00:10:49.982
moment we realize we're not,

300
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:53.441
but never really truly bringing it into our hearts,

301
00:10:53.441 --> 00:10:57.321
to understand and to transform, what's up with that?

302
00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:59.461
<v ->Well I'm gonna redefine perfection.</v>

303
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:01.601
'Cause I think we have perfection.

304
00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:04.281
Most people go around thinking,

305
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:07.061
"I'm not perfect yet," or "Nobody's perfect."

306
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:08.701
But that's because they have a fantasy

307
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:11.401
about what perfection's supposed to look like.

308
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:14.001
If you take a magnet and try to cut the magnet in half,

309
00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:16.441
and get only the positive part of the magnet,

310
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.601
if you cut it in half, no matter how fast you do it, or how

311
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:21.821
frequent you do it, you still get two sides to a magnet.

312
00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:25.081
Well, that's the perfection, the balance of opposites.

313
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:27.661
Now if you're striving for one side,

314
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:28.981
and you think that perfection is nice

315
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:30.701
without mean, kind without cruel,

316
00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:32.541
positive without negative, happy without sad,

317
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.641
give without take, support without challenge,

318
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:37.541
then if you think that that's what perfection is,

319
00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:39.501
then you haven't learned what perfection is.

320
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:41.021
And therefore, nobody's perfect,

321
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:42.941
and nobody's going to be perfect,

322
00:11:42.941 --> 00:11:46.481
'cause it's not real; the reality is we have two sides.

323
00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:47.861
We have a set of values, somebody

324
00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:49.221
supports us, we're nice; somebody

325
00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:51.021
challenges, we get mean; somebody

326
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:54.181
sells us something we really want,

327
00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:55.641
we're generous, we buy it.

328
00:11:55.641 --> 00:11:56.721
Something that try to sell us something

329
00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:58.821
we don't want, we're just stingy, we don't wanna buy it.

330
00:11:58.821 --> 00:12:02.101
So we have two sides, that's the perfection.

331
00:12:02.101 --> 00:12:05.811
And so what people think of as perfection, I disagree with.

332
00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:07.581
I think what they're searching for

333
00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.631
in perfection is an illusion, and think

334
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:12.031
we already have perfection, and

335
00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:13.671
the perfection is that we have a balance.

336
00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:16.051
And in actuality, when we are nice

337
00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:18.051
to somebody, we may find out that

338
00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:19.071
the very person we're nice to,

339
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.711
somebody else is givin' 'em a hard time.

340
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:22.271
And they find that we're mean to somebody,

341
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:24.491
somebody else is giving 'em a easier time.

342
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:26.511
We're actually participating in a matrix,

343
00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:28.271
a balance, that we've never taken

344
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.751
the time to really probe deep and look at.

345
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.311
We do, we realize there's actually

346
00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:35.291
a social matrix of love going on,

347
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:37.131
and love is always a balance and a

348
00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:39.911
synthesis and a synchronistive opposites.

349
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.211
And so once we realize that love

350
00:12:41.211 --> 00:12:43.631
is a balance of opposites, not one side.

351
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:45.211
'Cause see, most people think that love

352
00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:48.131
is the happy without the sad, the kind without the cruel,

353
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:50.851
positive without the negative - that's not what love is.

354
00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:52.711
Love is always a synthesis and

355
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:55.351
synchronisity of opposites; that means,

356
00:12:55.351 --> 00:12:58.011
the pair of opposites at the same time.

357
00:12:58.011 --> 00:12:58.831
<v Voiceover>It makes perfect sense</v>

358
00:12:58.831 --> 00:12:59.931
because when you think about the

359
00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:01.771
real breakthrough moments in one's lives,

360
00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:02.871
they almost always come out of

361
00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:04.611
something that we try to avoid,

362
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:06.451
something that might be, say, on

363
00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:09.051
the shadow side, or darker, or painful, or challenging.

364
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:10.291
<v ->They're not really shadow.</v>

365
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.091
<v Voiceover>They're actually just a part</v>

366
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:14.071
that motivates growth, or motivates

367
00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:16.151
a coming together or motivates union.

368
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:17.531
<v ->Well, I would say that the thing</v>

369
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:18.671
that you think is terrible a day,

370
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:19.751
a week, a month, a year or five

371
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:21.711
years later has terrific sitting in it.

372
00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:23.091
So, inside the yang was the yin

373
00:13:23.091 --> 00:13:25.431
or the yin in the yang, but we just take the time to do it.

374
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:27.371
I always say, "Why wait for the aging process

375
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.131
"to learn the wisdom of the ages,

376
00:13:29.131 --> 00:13:30.931
"why not know that it's already there,

377
00:13:30.931 --> 00:13:33.631
"and why not ask a series of questions that reveal it?"

378
00:13:33.631 --> 00:13:34.911
And when we reveal it, we realize that

379
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:37.031
there was nothing but love all the time.

380
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:39.031
There's nothing but love, all else is illusion.

381
00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:40.831
And that's when we finally realize that.

382
00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:42.591
And love is a pair of opposites,

383
00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:44.311
a synthesis and synchronistive,

384
00:13:44.311 --> 00:13:46.111
all complimentary opposites, and then if

385
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:48.771
we look really carefully at any one moment in our life,

386
00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:51.471
we realize that there's always these two sides going on.

387
00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:53.251
Our perceptions can't even see things

388
00:13:53.251 --> 00:13:55.591
unless it has a contrast of opposites.

389
00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:57.531
So we can't even perceive it, but what we do

390
00:13:57.531 --> 00:13:58.831
is we have a value filter that filters it

391
00:13:58.831 --> 00:14:01.051
and labels it one or the other,

392
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:02.491
and we have to get beyond that.

393
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:04.391
That's why I call it the soul.

394
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:07.431
The spirit of unconditioned love.

395
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:09.591
Unconditioned means we don't value judge it,

396
00:14:09.591 --> 00:14:13.011
we just see it as it is, that's how people wanna be loved.

397
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:15.291
That's how we wanna be loved; in that moment,

398
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.271
when we go beyond our values, in a moment of

399
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:20.991
synthesis and synchronisity, we feel love.

400
00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:24.151
That's the perfection, not one-sidedness.

401
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:25.311
See, most people think that love and

402
00:14:25.311 --> 00:14:27.211
hate are opposites, but I disagree.

403
00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:28.531
I think that love is a synthesis of

404
00:14:28.531 --> 00:14:31.751
admiration and despise, attraction and repulsion.

405
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:33.691
When you love somebody, sometimes

406
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:36.091
you're attracted to 'em, sometimes you're repelled from 'em.

407
00:14:36.091 --> 00:14:39.731
Attraction, repel - if you look at it, that's lovemaking.

408
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:42.811
Attraction, and repulsion, that's what lovemaking is.
<v Voiceover>Very true, very true.</v>

409
00:14:42.811 --> 00:14:44.271
<v ->If you take out and just have attraction,</v>

410
00:14:44.271 --> 00:14:47.531
then they're stuck, kinda like two dogs in a park.
<v Voiceover>Nothin' happens. (laughs)</v>

411
00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:49.871
<v ->They're stuck, okay, that's not love.</v>

412
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:51.252
And if they're repulsed that's not,

413
00:14:51.252 --> 00:14:53.532
but that oscillation, the synthesis

414
00:14:53.532 --> 00:14:55.512
of those two, is what make up love.

415
00:14:55.512 --> 00:14:57.192
And when people go into a marriage,

416
00:14:57.192 --> 00:14:58.892
and they have this expectation,

417
00:14:58.892 --> 00:15:00.232
this person's supposed to make me happy,

418
00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.532
this person's supposed to be kind to me,

419
00:15:01.532 --> 00:15:03.172
they're gonna be nice to me - they

420
00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:05.492
have a fantasy, and they're gonna have betrayal,

421
00:15:05.492 --> 00:15:06.792
and then they're gonna be negative,

422
00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:08.532
and blame and critical, and that

423
00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:10.512
criticism is a warning sign to let them know

424
00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:12.712
that they have a fantasy, that's all it is.

425
00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:14.232
Let 'em know to break their fantasy,

426
00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:16.012
and have a realistic expectiation,

427
00:15:16.012 --> 00:15:18.212
know that the person has a set of values,

428
00:15:18.212 --> 00:15:20.412
communicate those values, they get nice.

429
00:15:20.412 --> 00:15:22.712
Go against those values, they're gonna get mean.

430
00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:24.812
Welcome to the realities of life.

431
00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:27.812
They have two sides; embrace both sides and you love.

432
00:15:27.812 --> 00:15:29.052
That's why the marriage vows were

433
00:15:29.052 --> 00:15:31.572
for rich or for poor, for kind or for cruel,

434
00:15:31.572 --> 00:15:33.252
both sides, we forget that, we don't

435
00:15:33.252 --> 00:15:36.932
realize that we're so addicted to the infatuation.

436
00:15:36.932 --> 00:15:39.232
I always say it this way, and it's kinda funny,

437
00:15:39.232 --> 00:15:41.212
hope you don't mind me gettin' kinda humorous here.

438
00:15:41.212 --> 00:15:42.692
<v Voiceover>Not at all.</v>

439
00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.812
<v ->See, the Greeks said that there's a law</v>

440
00:15:44.812 --> 00:15:46.932
called this law of similars and differences.

441
00:15:46.932 --> 00:15:48.862
When you see somebody that you meet,

442
00:15:48.862 --> 00:15:50.742
you see more similarities than differences.

443
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.922
You get infatuated; "Oh my god,

444
00:15:52.922 --> 00:15:54.582
you have the same number of eyes as I do!"

445
00:15:54.582 --> 00:15:58.302
"Oh my god, the same number of teeth, we must be soulmates!"

446
00:15:58.302 --> 00:15:59.002
<v Voiceover>(laughs) I was just</v>

447
00:15:59.002 --> 00:16:00.502
going to ask you about exactly this.

448
00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:01.662
<v ->Okay, so you have more similarities</v>

449
00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:03.402
than differences, you get infatuated.

450
00:16:03.402 --> 00:16:04.882
The Greeks said if you see more differences

451
00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:06.642
than similarities, you have resentment.

452
00:16:06.642 --> 00:16:08.022
"We don't see eye-to-eye; we got two different

453
00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:10.682
"directions, we're not going in the same place anymore."

454
00:16:10.682 --> 00:16:12.542
Okay, that's resentment.

455
00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:15.073
They said that love is a synthesis

456
00:16:15.073 --> 00:16:17.093
of similarities and differences.

457
00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:18.433
That means we have some similarities,

458
00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:20.273
we have some differences, and if we

459
00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:21.953
were all similar, we'd move towards

460
00:16:21.953 --> 00:16:23.613
oneness, and we would then have a

461
00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:26.193
motivation to divide; if we all different,

462
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.653
we have a move towards manyness,

463
00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.693
we have a motivation to unify.

464
00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:31.533
So nature always has an oscillation

465
00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:32.933
between the one and the many.

466
00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:34.693
That's why when you're dating the many,

467
00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:35.953
you're searching for the one, but when

468
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.093
you got the one, you're wondering about the many.

469
00:16:38.093 --> 00:16:39.953
And nature's always providing that balance.

470
00:16:39.953 --> 00:16:41.793
So, what happens is when you see

471
00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.353
more similarities than differences,

472
00:16:43.353 --> 00:16:44.453
when you're infatuated and you see

473
00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:45.993
more positives than negatives,

474
00:16:45.993 --> 00:16:48.133
you move towards the mouth, you have a

475
00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.853
tube that runs through you; you have

476
00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:52.173
a mouth at one end, you have a butt at the other end.

477
00:16:52.173 --> 00:16:55.453
Okay, but there's a tube, you're like a big doughnut.

478
00:16:55.453 --> 00:16:56.533
And what happens is when you're

479
00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:57.973
infatuated with somebody, you move towards

480
00:16:57.973 --> 00:17:00.333
this and you wanna kiss 'em and you wanna lick 'em.

481
00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.233
When you move to the other end,

482
00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:04.493
you wanna not lick 'em, the opposite.
<v Voiceover>You wanna excrete them. (laughs)</v>

483
00:17:04.493 --> 00:17:08.133
<v ->So what happens, you kinda kiss them or kick 'em.</v>

484
00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:09.793
Now what's interesting is the reason being is

485
00:17:09.793 --> 00:17:12.193
because at this end, you've got sugar.

486
00:17:12.193 --> 00:17:13.533
It's a sugar addiction; that's why you

487
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.773
say when you're infatuated, "honey,"

488
00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:18.253
"you sweetie pie," "hunny-bunny,"

489
00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:21.073
"cutie beauty," you know, "I just love you,

490
00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:22.713
"you're such a sweetheart," "cupcake" -

491
00:17:22.713 --> 00:17:24.413
it's all sugar addiction, and it's

492
00:17:24.413 --> 00:17:26.973
endorphins and sugar and the brain is stimulated.

493
00:17:26.973 --> 00:17:28.453
When you're on the other end, you call 'em

494
00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:32.353
"asshole," "shit head," you go the other direction.

495
00:17:32.353 --> 00:17:34.133
And what happens, you literally go through the tube,

496
00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:35.893
that's why we we like glazed doughnuts,

497
00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:37.293
'cause they got sugar on one end.

498
00:17:37.293 --> 00:17:39.513
But what happens is that really, life is like a doughnut.

499
00:17:39.513 --> 00:17:40.733
So, when you really love somebody,

500
00:17:40.733 --> 00:17:42.293
you're not infatuated and not resentin' 'em,

501
00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:44.733
you could stomach 'em, right in the center.

502
00:17:44.733 --> 00:17:46.033
<v Voiceover>(laughs) There you go, you can stomach--</v>

503
00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:47.713
So that really should be the idea

504
00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:51.853
you draw in your mate and you ideally stomach each other.

505
00:17:51.853 --> 00:17:53.973
<v ->You stomach me, I can stomach you, I think.</v>

506
00:17:53.973 --> 00:17:55.953
You would say, "I think I can stomach this person."

507
00:17:55.953 --> 00:17:57.933
But reality is you're not infatuated,

508
00:17:57.933 --> 00:18:00.293
you're not resentful, you're a synthesis of the two.

509
00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:02.413
Because there's times you like and times you dislike.

510
00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:03.733
They're gonna support, they're gonna challenge.

511
00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:05.313
And if you had a relationship that

512
00:18:05.313 --> 00:18:07.073
did nothing but support, and they were just,

513
00:18:07.073 --> 00:18:08.533
"Whatever you wanna do, whatever you wanna do,"

514
00:18:08.533 --> 00:18:09.893
you'd stomp on 'em, and if they

515
00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:11.453
challenge you too much, you leave.

516
00:18:11.453 --> 00:18:12.553
So you have to have a balance of

517
00:18:12.553 --> 00:18:14.853
support and challenge to make a relationship grow.

518
00:18:14.853 --> 00:18:17.293
And that is the perfection, and most

519
00:18:17.293 --> 00:18:18.993
people think that perfection's one side,

520
00:18:18.993 --> 00:18:19.953
and then they think, "Well, I'm not

521
00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:20.933
"perfect and they're not perfect."

522
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.213
The truth is, you are perfect, you

523
00:18:22.213 --> 00:18:25.093
just haven't realized what perfection is, pair of opposites.

524
00:18:25.093 --> 00:18:26.473
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the whole soulmate thing.</v>

525
00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:28.453
You brought up the soulmate thing a second ago.

526
00:18:28.453 --> 00:18:30.813
Usually that has a lot of sack-rin attached to it, in the

527
00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:34.513
first, "Oh, he's my soulmate, I knew it from the first--"
<v ->That's infatuation.</v>

528
00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.573
<v Voiceover>That's infatuation.</v>

529
00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:36.673
<v ->That's not the soulmate.</v>

530
00:18:36.673 --> 00:18:38.713
<v Voiceover>Right, let's talk about real soulmates,</v>

531
00:18:38.713 --> 00:18:40.753
because I often find that as heavily

532
00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:42.253
laden with karma or whatever you

533
00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:43.593
wanna call it, so, enough sugar to

534
00:18:43.593 --> 00:18:46.893
draw you together, hell or high water.

535
00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:49.693
<v ->Okay, let me elaborate by telling a story.</v>

536
00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:53.233
I'm flying from Houston, Texas to Las Vegas.

537
00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.113
I get on the plane last.

538
00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:57.373
I sit in my seat and there's a 27-year-old

539
00:18:57.373 --> 00:18:59.913
blonde, beautiful girl sitting next to me.

540
00:18:59.913 --> 00:19:03.873
I have to talk to her, it's just reflex.

541
00:19:03.873 --> 00:19:04.633
So I'm starting to chat with her,

542
00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:05.554
I said, "So what's your name?"

543
00:19:05.554 --> 00:19:07.193
She says "Tina" and she says "What's your name?"

544
00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:08.933
and I said, "I'm John," and says, "what do you do?"

545
00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:10.253
she says, "I do hair and makeup

546
00:19:10.253 --> 00:19:12.293
"for the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas,"

547
00:19:12.293 --> 00:19:14.533
and I said, "Oh, great, I'm a travelling speaker and stuff."

548
00:19:14.533 --> 00:19:15.893
I said to Tina, "What is your goals

549
00:19:15.893 --> 00:19:18.393
"in life, what is your dream?" I ask people this.

550
00:19:18.393 --> 00:19:20.753
She says, "Well, right now I'm looking for my soulmate."

551
00:19:20.753 --> 00:19:22.493
And I said, "Great, would you like to

552
00:19:22.493 --> 00:19:24.614
meet your soulmate tonight on this flight?"

553
00:19:24.614 --> 00:19:26.693
She kinda looked at me like, "God you're presumptuous!"

554
00:19:26.693 --> 00:19:28.513
And I said, "No, I'm serious, how

555
00:19:28.513 --> 00:19:29.433
"would you like to meet your soulmate?"

556
00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:32.153
She goes, "Well, okay, what do I do?"

557
00:19:32.153 --> 00:19:34.573
and I said, "You just answer some questions, okay.

558
00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.253
"What are you looking for in a soulmate?"

559
00:19:36.253 --> 00:19:38.413
She goes, "Well, I'm looking for an intelligent man."

560
00:19:38.413 --> 00:19:40.674
I said, "Great," I wrote it down

561
00:19:40.674 --> 00:19:42.133
on the little ticket packet, I said,

562
00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.453
"Great, intelligence, what else?"

563
00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:45.153
"I'm looking for somebody who's got lotsa money."

564
00:19:45.153 --> 00:19:46.093
I said, "What else?"

565
00:19:46.093 --> 00:19:47.653
"Looking for somebody who's got a great sense of humor."

566
00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:48.653
"So what else?"

567
00:19:48.653 --> 00:19:49.693
"Lookin' for somebody who's good lookin'."

568
00:19:49.693 --> 00:19:50.833
Right, I wrote down 22 different

569
00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:52.713
things that she was looking for.

570
00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:54.753
And I said, "Okay, now here's the clincher.

571
00:19:54.753 --> 00:19:55.873
"Where is somebody in your life

572
00:19:55.873 --> 00:19:58.473
"right now, male, that's incredibly intelligent,

573
00:19:58.473 --> 00:20:00.753
"that's got the intelligence you're looking for?"

574
00:20:00.753 --> 00:20:03.953
She goes, "Oh, I know, the guy that I work for,

575
00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.653
"my boss, he's incredibly intelligent, he's a genius,

576
00:20:06.653 --> 00:20:08.513
"and he's amazing, he owns the MGM Grand Hotel,

577
00:20:08.513 --> 00:20:09.913
"he's really brilliant," I said,

578
00:20:09.913 --> 00:20:11.413
"Can you see you have that in your life?"

579
00:20:11.413 --> 00:20:13.173
She goes, "Yeah," I said, "And

580
00:20:13.173 --> 00:20:15.433
"who's got a sense of humor like you're talking about?"

581
00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:16.213
"Oh I know who that is, that's a

582
00:20:16.213 --> 00:20:17.453
guy who cuts hair next to me, he's

583
00:20:17.453 --> 00:20:19.073
"a gay guy, he's really funny, he's hilarious,

584
00:20:19.073 --> 00:20:21.294
"he's got such a sense of humor, we just love him."

585
00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:22.694
I said, "Can you see a male with

586
00:20:22.694 --> 00:20:24.014
a sense of humor in your life?"

587
00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.394
She goes, "Yeah," I said, "And

588
00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:27.294
"who is it that's got lotsa money?"

589
00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:28.734
Goes, "Oh, I know, that's my boss again,

590
00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:30.134
"he's a billionaire, he's got lotsa money,

591
00:20:30.134 --> 00:20:31.934
"and he actually help me get a car last year,

592
00:20:31.934 --> 00:20:33.574
"and he helped me go on a trip to Hawaii,

593
00:20:33.574 --> 00:20:36.434
"and, wow, yeah, I guess I have that, too,"

594
00:20:36.434 --> 00:20:38.574
I said, "Right," I said, "Who's really good looking?"

595
00:20:38.574 --> 00:20:39.434
and she goes, "Oh, that's my ex

596
00:20:39.434 --> 00:20:41.214
"boyfriend, I know who he is."

597
00:20:41.214 --> 00:20:42.474
And I said, "Ex boyfriend?"

598
00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:44.014
and says, "Yeah, he's, like, really

599
00:20:44.014 --> 00:20:45.674
"an airhead, he has got no brains at all,

600
00:20:45.674 --> 00:20:47.694
"I don't like him to even talk, but he's good

601
00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:48.594
"lookin', and sometimes I take

602
00:20:48.594 --> 00:20:50.514
"him out socializing 'cause he's something to look at."

603
00:20:50.514 --> 00:20:53.214
But, we went through all 22 different things,

604
00:20:53.214 --> 00:20:55.794
and she realized that every single thing

605
00:20:55.794 --> 00:20:58.314
that she was looking for was in her life.

606
00:20:58.314 --> 00:21:00.914
Nothing was missing, and I said to her,

607
00:21:00.914 --> 00:21:03.054
"I want you to learn something today.

608
00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:06.034
"Your soulmate is with you 24 hours a day.

609
00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:08.414
"It's in a form you may not be recognizing,

610
00:21:08.414 --> 00:21:09.694
"because you may be subordinating

611
00:21:09.694 --> 00:21:11.174
"yourself to outside authorities

612
00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:12.614
"and injecting idealisms into your

613
00:21:12.614 --> 00:21:14.554
"life about how it's s'posed to be,

614
00:21:14.554 --> 00:21:15.914
"but your unconscious motives will

615
00:21:15.914 --> 00:21:18.914
"constantly create your soulmate at any one moment.

616
00:21:18.914 --> 00:21:20.394
"And your soulmate is always exactly

617
00:21:20.394 --> 00:21:21.934
"all the things you're looking for,

618
00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:23.745
"and its opposite, so if we look

619
00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:25.165
"carefully, exactly the opposites

620
00:21:25.165 --> 00:21:26.345
"of these things, you find out that

621
00:21:26.345 --> 00:21:27.725
"that's in your life, too," and she goes,

622
00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:28.785
"Well, what does that mean?"

623
00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:30.405
"Does that mean am I ever gonna get a guy?"

624
00:21:30.405 --> 00:21:32.985
I said, "Listen carefully, the reason why

625
00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:34.925
"you have a disperse between a variety

626
00:21:34.925 --> 00:21:36.745
"of men and not in just one man

627
00:21:36.745 --> 00:21:38.365
"is because you've had pain associated

628
00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:41.645
"with one man, so let me hear about the relationships."

629
00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:43.025
So the last mate relationship she had

630
00:21:43.025 --> 00:21:44.645
a guy who was very wealthy, good looking,

631
00:21:44.645 --> 00:21:46.465
but a control freak, and didn't want her

632
00:21:46.465 --> 00:21:47.985
to go out, didn't want her to socialize,

633
00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:49.305
didn't want her to do things, and while

634
00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:50.925
she was doing, he kept her so busy,

635
00:21:50.925 --> 00:21:52.725
her business drops, she'd lose the money,

636
00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:54.765
and she felt trapped, and she says,

637
00:21:54.765 --> 00:21:56.025
"I don't wanna do that again."

638
00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.365
We went to the guy before that,

639
00:21:57.365 --> 00:21:59.705
and this guy was not quite as good-looking,

640
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:01.775
but he had a lot of wealth, and he traveled

641
00:22:01.775 --> 00:22:04.455
a lot and he wasn't there and she felt lonely sometimes,

642
00:22:04.455 --> 00:22:06.364
and he'd call and then he'd smother her sometimes

643
00:22:06.364 --> 00:22:09.224
with telephones, and she says, "This isn't working."

644
00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:10.784
And we went through the last three relationships,

645
00:22:10.784 --> 00:22:12.764
and she realized that she unconsciously

646
00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:14.404
had so much pain associated with them

647
00:22:14.404 --> 00:22:16.204
that she swore she didn't want to do that again,

648
00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:18.504
so she dispersed her values in a different form,

649
00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:21.484
and then manifested the diversity of men

650
00:22:21.484 --> 00:22:23.064
so she could have her independence,

651
00:22:23.064 --> 00:22:24.224
so she could travel when she wanted,

652
00:22:24.224 --> 00:22:25.664
so she could have her own money,

653
00:22:25.664 --> 00:22:27.465
so she could still socialize and be with men,

654
00:22:27.465 --> 00:22:29.784
and she also got what she was looking for

655
00:22:29.784 --> 00:22:32.525
in a powerful way where she was getting her independence.

656
00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:35.144
So when she realized what her real values were,

657
00:22:35.144 --> 00:22:36.824
and then we looked at her real values,

658
00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:39.245
she manifested the soulmate in that form.

659
00:22:39.245 --> 00:22:41.644
Not in the form she thought it was s'posed to be in.

660
00:22:41.644 --> 00:22:43.344
So I just wanna say this for anybody

661
00:22:43.344 --> 00:22:44.624
out there looking for a soulmate,

662
00:22:44.624 --> 00:22:46.805
nobody's missing a soulmate - it's

663
00:22:46.805 --> 00:22:51.044
every trait that a human being has, nobody is missing it.

664
00:22:51.044 --> 00:22:52.724
You think what you're looking for

665
00:22:52.724 --> 00:22:54.604
sometimes is a fantasy mate, and when you

666
00:22:54.604 --> 00:22:56.404
get the fantasy mate you think you're getting,

667
00:22:56.404 --> 00:22:57.684
you get all elated and then you end

668
00:22:57.684 --> 00:22:59.745
up finding out it's not what you thought,

669
00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:00.784
'cause the other side shows up,

670
00:23:00.784 --> 00:23:02.424
'cause they always have two sides.

671
00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:04.304
Realize that you are surrounded by a soulmate,

672
00:23:04.304 --> 00:23:05.344
the hierarchy of your values is

673
00:23:05.344 --> 00:23:06.464
dictating the form it's in; if you're

674
00:23:06.464 --> 00:23:08.024
not satisfied in it, you either got

675
00:23:08.024 --> 00:23:10.124
to shift your values, so that's what we did.

676
00:23:10.124 --> 00:23:11.504
We went in there, and I did the

677
00:23:11.504 --> 00:23:13.004
Demartini method, which is a series of

678
00:23:13.004 --> 00:23:15.124
balancing out perceptions, cleared all the

679
00:23:15.124 --> 00:23:17.664
emotional baggage on the last three guys,

680
00:23:17.664 --> 00:23:19.824
had to do this before she landed in Las Vegas,

681
00:23:19.824 --> 00:23:21.504
and showed some of the drawbacks

682
00:23:21.504 --> 00:23:23.984
of dispersing, and reshuffled the pain

683
00:23:23.984 --> 00:23:26.604
from the one over to the many,

684
00:23:26.604 --> 00:23:28.144
back from the many back to the one,

685
00:23:28.144 --> 00:23:29.924
and in three weeks she got a guy

686
00:23:29.924 --> 00:23:32.064
from the Middle East, tall, good-looking,

687
00:23:32.064 --> 00:23:34.244
handsome, intelligent, wealth,

688
00:23:34.244 --> 00:23:35.804
traveled the world, gave her freedom,

689
00:23:35.804 --> 00:23:37.724
wanted her to keep her job, loved

690
00:23:37.724 --> 00:23:39.004
being with her, and rendezvoused

691
00:23:39.004 --> 00:23:41.144
with her in different locations.

692
00:23:41.144 --> 00:23:42.464
So she manifested that, once we

693
00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:44.444
dissolved the pains of the past,

694
00:23:44.444 --> 00:23:45.824
baggage she had that she accumulated,

695
00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:48.824
which forced her to shift it into the form she had it.

696
00:23:48.824 --> 00:23:49.784
<v Voiceover>Isn't that amazing?</v>

697
00:23:49.784 --> 00:23:52.184
So it's not that the list, per se, is wrong.

698
00:23:52.184 --> 00:23:54.144
I mean, you weren't featured in the secret,

699
00:23:54.144 --> 00:23:56.824
we're talking about the laws of attraction here,

700
00:23:56.824 --> 00:24:00.384
and a lot of this, people do their vision board,

701
00:24:00.384 --> 00:24:02.324
they do their lists, and so forth.

702
00:24:02.324 --> 00:24:04.844
So it's not the list that's wrong?

703
00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:06.204
<v ->It's just incomplete.</v>

704
00:24:06.204 --> 00:24:07.244
<v Voiceover>It's incomplete.</v>

705
00:24:07.244 --> 00:24:08.564
<v ->See, I try to teach people anytime</v>

706
00:24:08.564 --> 00:24:09.644
you're trying to find somebody

707
00:24:09.644 --> 00:24:10.884
that's only positive and never negative,

708
00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:13.324
only nice, never mean, you have a fantasy.

709
00:24:13.324 --> 00:24:14.284
And these people are gonna be met

710
00:24:14.284 --> 00:24:15.544
for a short period of time, and then

711
00:24:15.544 --> 00:24:16.464
when you get to really know 'em,

712
00:24:16.464 --> 00:24:17.924
you're gonna find that they don't last.

713
00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:19.484
The wise thing to do is to have

714
00:24:19.484 --> 00:24:21.844
both sides, 'cause you have both sides.

715
00:24:21.844 --> 00:24:23.304
If you're trying to get rid of half yourself,

716
00:24:23.304 --> 00:24:25.064
you'll never find a way of loving yourself.

717
00:24:25.064 --> 00:24:26.744
If you're trying to get rid of half of them,

718
00:24:26.744 --> 00:24:28.404
you won't be able to love them.

719
00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:29.764
You don't have to get rid of any

720
00:24:29.764 --> 00:24:31.784
part of yourself to love yourself.

721
00:24:31.784 --> 00:24:32.684
You just haven't taken the time to

722
00:24:32.684 --> 00:24:34.384
find out how it serves you, the

723
00:24:34.384 --> 00:24:36.165
part you think you wanna get rid of.

724
00:24:36.165 --> 00:24:37.804
If you're infatuated with one half

725
00:24:37.804 --> 00:24:38.824
and resent the other half, you'll

726
00:24:38.824 --> 00:24:40.284
be trying to get rid of half your life,

727
00:24:40.284 --> 00:24:41.744
and other people's lives; when you

728
00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:43.045
find out that the thing that challenges

729
00:24:43.045 --> 00:24:44.704
you serves you, and the thing that

730
00:24:44.704 --> 00:24:46.464
supports you actually dis-serves you,

731
00:24:46.464 --> 00:24:48.284
put those back into balance, you'll

732
00:24:48.284 --> 00:24:50.744
find out that you can love yourself for all parts.

733
00:24:50.744 --> 00:24:52.244
<v Voiceover>And that's the secret.</v>

734
00:24:52.244 --> 00:24:54.424
<v ->That's the real secret, and everybody's</v>

735
00:24:54.424 --> 00:24:55.424
manifesting according to their own

736
00:24:55.424 --> 00:24:57.184
conscious motives and their real values,

737
00:24:57.184 --> 00:24:58.665
but most people are subordinating

738
00:24:58.665 --> 00:24:59.964
themselves to outside authorities,

739
00:24:59.964 --> 00:25:01.324
injecting the values of others in there,

740
00:25:01.324 --> 00:25:02.424
setting goals that are matching

741
00:25:02.424 --> 00:25:04.064
outside authorities instead of their own,

742
00:25:04.064 --> 00:25:05.424
and then wondering why they can't

743
00:25:05.424 --> 00:25:07.404
manifest what they want, in truth,

744
00:25:07.404 --> 00:25:10.264
they are constantly manifesting what their real values are,

745
00:25:10.264 --> 00:25:11.444
and that's why you have to know

746
00:25:11.444 --> 00:25:14.045
thyself, be thyself to love thyself.

747
00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:17.144
<v Voiceover>Well, on that note, thank you so much.</v>

748
00:25:17.144 --> 00:25:19.844
You've taken time out, you just did

749
00:25:19.844 --> 00:25:21.064
an interview, you're doing another one

750
00:25:21.064 --> 00:25:22.824
in a few minutes and yet you took time for us.

751
00:25:22.824 --> 00:25:24.165
I thank you very much for that.

752
00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:26.204
And I will watch this one again, too,

753
00:25:26.204 --> 00:25:27.605
just like I said last time, you really

754
00:25:27.605 --> 00:25:30.064
fling it at us, but every word has meaning.

755
00:25:30.064 --> 00:25:31.184
<v ->Well thank you, and may everyone</v>

756
00:25:31.184 --> 00:25:33.284
open their heart to "The Heart of Love."

757
00:25:33.284 --> 00:25:36.244
<v Voiceover>Yes, thank you.</v>

758
00:25:36.244 --> 00:25:37.364
<v ->If you enjoyed this interview,</v>

759
00:25:37.364 --> 00:25:38.644
you might also enjoy watching our

760
00:25:38.644 --> 00:25:40.424
first interview with John, as well

762
00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:43.724
Meanwhile, you can learn much more

763
