00:00:01.492 --> 00:00:04.522
<v ->Jerry E. Smith has been out rabble-rousing with his new</v>

2
00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:07.854
book, HAARP: The Ultimate Weapon of the Conspiracy.

3
00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:09.897
As sensational as the title seems,

4
00:00:09.897 --> 00:00:12.707
the story he tells is based on an incredible maze

5
00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:15.667
of science, the military, and secrecy.

6
00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.605
Jerry built his work upon the work of Dr. Nick Begich,

7
00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:21.507
who offered the first public research into this subject

8
00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:24.317
in his book, Angels Don't Play This HAARP,

9
00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:26.151
written several years ago.

10
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.322
As the story continues to evolve,

11
00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:32.188
the questions about this little known project loom large.

12
00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:33.686
What exactly is HAARP?

13
00:00:33.686 --> 00:00:37.330
Let's see what Jerry has to say.

14
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.943
Can you start with a really brief primer,

15
00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.716
so we can get right on to the more current stuff.

16
00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.315
<v ->Sure, when completed, and now scheduled</v>

17
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:57.682
for about 2008, it will be the world's largest

18
00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.377
radio broadcast station,

19
00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:03.678
but it's not designed to broadcast for human ears.

20
00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:05.853
It uses a unique patented ability

21
00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:08.059
to focus radio frequency energy.

22
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:10.822
It's designed to put this radio frequency energy

23
00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:15.002
into a spot at the top of the atmosphere.

24
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.545
<v Regina>Let's talk about the spot at the top of the</v>

25
00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.715
atmosphere, that doesn't sound, at first glance,

26
00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:22.602
like a good or healthy thing for the atmosphere.

27
00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:25.563
What is this project doing there?

28
00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:30.563
<v ->Well, it's a type of device called an ionospheric heater,</v>

29
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.974
which because it heats the ionosphere.

30
00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:36.780
The ionosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere.

31
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.124
It stops incoming solar radiation.

32
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:44.896
It's incredibly important to maintain life on this planet.

33
00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:48.321
You need the ionosphere or we'd all be fried.

34
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:50.457
What this thing does is it injects energy

35
00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:54.602
into the ionosphere, heating the ionosphere.

36
00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:59.327
This spot is gonna be about two and half miles across,

37
00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.681
excuse me, about 2 and a half miles deep

38
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.476
by about 12 miles across by 50 to 90 miles up,

39
00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:06.147
depending on how they're using the antenna field.

40
00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:07.285
HAARP is an antenna field.

41
00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:10.489
It's a field of antennas so arranged as to work

42
00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.981
as one big antenna.

43
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:17.294
This energy injected into the atmosphere

44
00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:19.825
will heat the ionosphere and cause it to rise

45
00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:21.764
and go out into space.

46
00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:25.839
It will change the shape of the ionosphere.

47
00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.817
<v Regina>What might be the point of that?</v>

48
00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:31.075
<v ->There are a number of technologies.</v>

49
00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:33.676
Basically this injecting energy into the atmosphere

50
00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:37.043
to make it do things is called ionospheric enhancement.

51
00:02:37.043 --> 00:02:39.045
You gotta love that.
(laughing)

52
00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:40.345
Only the military would think that

53
00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.050
breaking something makes it better.

54
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.591
<v Regina>Enhancement, okay.</v>

55
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:49.591
<v ->Yeah, so the idea here is that, one of the first things is</v>

56
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:54.935
if the ionosphere's shape is changed,

57
00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:57.420
you change the way it bounces radio waves.

58
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.566
Long wave and short wave radio bounces off the ionosphere.

59
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.667
Have you ever been traveling in your car

60
00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.071
and you pick up an AM radio station

61
00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:06.882
from the other side of the country,

62
00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:10.376
that's because it's bouncing off the ionosphere.

63
00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:15.183
What they can do is if they can intentionally

64
00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:17.621
reshape the ionosphere,

65
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.920
they can change the way it's bouncing.

66
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.089
If they know which radio frequencies are bouncing where

67
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:27.524
at what time, they can jam worldwide radio communications.

68
00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:31.298
Also, by one of the things that this project

69
00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:34.769
is intended to find out is can they use it to make

70
00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.230
what are called artificial ionospheric mirrors.

71
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.230
That is, can you create zones of increased

72
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:44.011
ion density,

73
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:49.011
so create an artificial ionosphere

74
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.219
that would bounce radio waves,

75
00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.309
so not only can you jam the enemy,

76
00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.352
but you can keep your own channels open

77
00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:59.300
by making your own artificial bounce spots.

78
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.725
<v Regina>This would appear to have military applications?</v>

79
00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:04.805
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

80
00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:08.543
If you're engaged in a war,

81
00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:10.273
one of the things you wanna do is you wanna cut

82
00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:14.293
the enemy's communication lines.

83
00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:17.782
This would be a brilliant way to do that.

84
00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:21.788
The program was initially funded by the United States Senate

85
00:04:21.788 --> 00:04:24.284
to do something called earth penetrating tomography.

86
00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:25.851
This a brand new science.

87
00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:28.614
It did not exist before 1980.

88
00:04:28.614 --> 00:04:30.960
What it is, it's like CAT scanning the earth.

89
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.745
It's also been described as a dirt radar.

90
00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:38.595
One of the ways of doing this is that with HAARP,

91
00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:40.163
with this injection of energy

92
00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:42.137
into the top of the atmosphere,

93
00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:46.711
this literally blows the atoms, blows the molecules

94
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:49.474
of the atmosphere apart, breaks them down.

95
00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:51.506
When they break down, they give off a scream

96
00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:54.246
of extremely low frequency radiation.

97
00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:57.183
This is called ELF, extremely low frequency.

98
00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.679
These radio waves penetrate deep into the earth

99
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:03.162
and deep into the sea.

100
00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:07.899
HAARP was funded under counter proliferation studies.

101
00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:12.833
The idea is that if you can get earth penetrating tomography

102
00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:16.757
to work, you can look with this ELF extremely deep,

103
00:05:16.757 --> 00:05:19.544
maybe as much as two miles.

104
00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:24.544
You can find and monitor enemy underground bases for the

105
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.784
manufactuer and launch of weapons of mass destruction.

106
00:05:29.784 --> 00:05:34.784
That was the trust but verify aspect of Star Wars.

107
00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:37.563
<v Regina>Trust but verify.</v>

108
00:05:37.563 --> 00:05:40.117
You can burn a whole in the ionosphere in essence,

109
00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:42.160
or in essence heat it to a point.

110
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.563
<v ->You can heat it.</v>

111
00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:48.697
This will create a plasma that will go out into space.

112
00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:52.946
This plasma will be a electrically charged plasma

113
00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:57.717
so that anything coming into it will be fried out.

114
00:05:57.717 --> 00:06:02.717
This is a Star Wars defense shield that anything coming in,

115
00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:07.110
like incoming ICBM's, would pass through this plasma

116
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.293
and have it's electronics shorted out.

117
00:06:09.293 --> 00:06:13.066
Also, the spy satellites travel right at the top

118
00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.297
of the atmosphere.

119
00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:18.061
If you punch this up a little bit, it goes into

120
00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:19.803
the zone where the spy satellites are

121
00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:23.506
and you can fry out the enemy's eyes.

122
00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.631
<v Regina>What about atmospheric changes?</v>

123
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:26.977
What about global warming?

124
00:06:26.977 --> 00:06:29.543
Are these issues that play into this?

125
00:06:29.543 --> 00:06:31.877
<v ->Those are questions that have been raised since</v>

126
00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:36.877
the world first heard about HAARP.

127
00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:42.160
If you're creating this flow out of space,

128
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.424
if you're moving the atmosphere out,

129
00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:48.267
you're of course creating a lower pressure zone,

130
00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:52.366
you're creating a void that the lower air will fill into.

131
00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:56.336
You may be able to generate winds.

132
00:06:56.336 --> 00:07:00.806
There is some issues about how much weather control

133
00:07:00.806 --> 00:07:04.115
it actually is capable of because here, we're talking about

134
00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.936
injecting the energy into the ionosphere,

135
00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:08.736
which is the top of the atmosphere,

136
00:07:08.736 --> 00:07:12.091
where the weather happens in the troposphere

137
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.983
at the bottom of the atmosphere.

138
00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:18.430
There's many miles distance between these two regions.

139
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.274
One of the applications

140
00:07:23.274 --> 00:07:26.674
in the original patent,

141
00:07:26.674 --> 00:07:29.076
the patent speculated that you could create

142
00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:32.107
artificial lenses in the atmosphere.

143
00:07:32.107 --> 00:07:36.077
This is like, imagine if you will, a magnifying glass,

144
00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:38.446
and on a sunny day you can use a magnifying glass

145
00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:40.582
to start fires.

146
00:07:40.582 --> 00:07:44.715
So, the idea is they may be able to create artificial

147
00:07:44.715 --> 00:07:48.360
magnifying glass lenses in the upper atmosphere

148
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.360
that would direct more solar energy into the lower

149
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.836
atmosphere and heat it up,

150
00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:59.936
which would then allow you to move it around.

151
00:07:59.936 --> 00:08:02.037
If you can move the lower atmosphere around,

152
00:08:02.037 --> 00:08:03.697
then you can move the jet stream,

153
00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:05.079
and if you can move the jet stream,

154
00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:09.829
then you can dial up either floods or droughts at will.

155
00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:13.869
<v Regina>I'm going to ask you this one question</v>

156
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:15.147
and then we'll go back to that,

157
00:08:15.147 --> 00:08:17.387
is this technology already developed sufficiently where that

158
00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:21.126
could be done, theoretically, at this time already?

159
00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.657
<v ->I believe that's an unknown.</v>

160
00:08:23.657 --> 00:08:27.500
What we have, the HAARP side is still under construction.

161
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.739
They started the project around 1990.

162
00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:33.305
They started building the site which is in

163
00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:36.869
southeastern Alaska, about 1993.

164
00:08:36.869 --> 00:08:41.869
It's currently not scheduled for completion until late 1997,

165
00:08:42.384 --> 00:08:46.969
or sometime in the summer of '98.

166
00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:48.154
<v Regina>You mean 2008?</v>

167
00:08:48.154 --> 00:08:50.023
<v ->Yeah, 2008. I'm sorry, yeah.</v>

168
00:08:50.023 --> 00:08:51.346
<v Regina>You were a decade back.</v>

169
00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:52.217
(laughing)

170
00:08:52.217 --> 00:08:54.423
<v ->It's hard to talk and think at the same time.</v>

171
00:08:54.423 --> 00:08:57.163
<v Regina>It should be completed in 2007, 2008?</v>

172
00:08:57.163 --> 00:08:59.787
<v ->Right, right in there. We don't really know</v>

173
00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:04.535
what its output is capable of until they do it.

174
00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:08.274
That's the aspect of this thing,

175
00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:11.641
is this thing is a scientific project to do something

176
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:14.172
that's never been done before.

177
00:09:14.172 --> 00:09:16.250
Whenever you're doing something that's never been done

178
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.190
before, there are all kinds of unknowns.

179
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.646
<v Regina>This subject often falls under</v>

180
00:09:21.646 --> 00:09:25.082
he subject of conspiracy theory, but in essence, there are

181
00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:28.054
patent trails that are indicating that all of these

182
00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:31.955
technologies are what are under construction, basically.

183
00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:36.955
<v ->Right, these patent trails are very</v>

184
00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:41.371
controversial in that there was a company

185
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.504
named APTI, originally Arco Power Technologies Incorporated

186
00:09:45.504 --> 00:09:49.533
and the "Arco" in the name kind of revealed too much,

187
00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:50.529
so they changed it to

188
00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:53.584
Advanced Power Technologies Incorporated.

189
00:09:53.584 --> 00:09:57.381
APTI got bought by E Systems, one of the largest

190
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:02.129
of the U.S. defense contractors,

191
00:10:02.129 --> 00:10:05.299
and then E Systems got bought by Ratheon,

192
00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:07.760
which is like the third or so largest,

193
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.500
certainly within the top ten.

194
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.239
Then recently, Ratheon has sold E Systems

195
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.478
to British Aerospace, or now BAE Systems.

196
00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:20.009
So, BAE Systems currently has the contract

197
00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:23.480
to finish the project.

198
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.480
The chain of custody on these things,

199
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:32.118
the area of interest is that there are these patents

200
00:10:32.118 --> 00:10:36.193
that APTI, A-P-T-I created.

201
00:10:36.193 --> 00:10:38.956
These patents are for a field of antennas

202
00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:41.093
40 miles on a side.

203
00:10:41.093 --> 00:10:45.702
That would have a tremendous impact on the environment.

204
00:10:45.702 --> 00:10:48.906
HAARP project is, at the moment, it's 1,000 feet on one side

205
00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:51.460
by 1,200 feet on the other.

206
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.805
The HAARP people say, "Oh no, we have nothing

207
00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:55.477
"whatsoever to do with those patents.

208
00:10:55.477 --> 00:10:57.776
"It's not us, we're not doing that."

209
00:10:57.776 --> 00:11:00.841
Except that, the people who own those patents

210
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:05.055
get the contract because it is a unique item.

211
00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:06.425
Yes, it is a ionospheric heater,

212
00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:08.457
and there are ionospheric heaters around the planet.

213
00:11:08.457 --> 00:11:10.384
There are 20 or 30 of them in operation,

214
00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:14.227
but only HAARP has the ability to focus the engery

215
00:11:14.227 --> 00:11:16.828
from the field into a spot in the atmosphere.

216
00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:21.828
That uniqueness is in those patents.

217
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Regina>Now, this project, if you listen to HAARP's</v>

218
00:11:29.448 --> 00:11:32.652
public releases, for example,

219
00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:36.391
is a simple private sector project.

220
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:37.621
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

221
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:39.723
<v Regina>But I'm hearing military contractors</v>

222
00:11:39.723 --> 00:11:42.875
at each stage here involved.
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

223
00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:45.059
Military contractors. Who has the contract right now?

224
00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:47.560
British Aerospace North America.

225
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.230
It's being built by their electronic

226
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.433
and information warfare division.

227
00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:56.372
(laughing)

228
00:11:56.372 --> 00:11:57.509
<v Regina>Sounds friendly.</v>

229
00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:01.480
<v ->The project management is from an office in DARPA.</v>

230
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.480
DARPA is the defense advanced research projects agency.

231
00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:11.650
If you've ever seen the James Bond films,

232
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.588
you probably remember Q, the old guy who comes up

233
00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:16.596
with all these crazy gadgets.

234
00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:19.197
Imagine Q having 10,000 employees

235
00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.633
and a 4 billion dollar budget.

236
00:12:22.633 --> 00:12:24.468
That's DARPA.

237
00:12:24.468 --> 00:12:29.274
DARPA is the cutting edge of military technology.

238
00:12:29.274 --> 00:12:32.908
There are eight directorates within DARPA.

239
00:12:32.908 --> 00:12:36.507
HAARP is being directed by the TTO,

240
00:12:36.507 --> 00:12:41.507
the tactical technical office.

241
00:12:42.254 --> 00:12:45.052
Now, what their job is, is developing

242
00:12:45.052 --> 00:12:48.326
what are called force multipliers.

243
00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:49.963
To give you an idea of what a force multiplier is,

244
00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:52.390
imagine you're going to invade Grenada,

245
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.990
and you've got a fleet of ships,

246
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.231
but you don't want the Grenadians to know

247
00:12:57.231 --> 00:12:58.973
that you have these fleet of ships out there,

248
00:12:58.973 --> 00:13:02.966
so you create fogs and clouds to hide your ships in.

249
00:13:02.966 --> 00:13:06.240
Well, the fogs and clouds are force multipliers

250
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.117
because your force can sneak in and is more forceful

251
00:13:11.117 --> 00:13:12.684
because of having this.

252
00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:14.751
<v Regina>Ah, force multiplier. Yes.</v>

253
00:13:14.751 --> 00:13:18.483
<v ->So, HAARP is being built by guys who's job it is</v>

254
00:13:18.483 --> 00:13:20.979
to make force multipliers.

255
00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:25.979
This turns up constantly in the HAARP literature.

256
00:13:27.435 --> 00:13:30.871
The mission head, the guy in charge of HAARP,

257
00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:35.736
at DARPA and the TTO, is Dr. Sheldon Meth.

258
00:13:35.736 --> 00:13:38.778
He runs four projects.

259
00:13:38.778 --> 00:13:40.763
Two are laser development projects.

260
00:13:40.763 --> 00:13:44.211
Ones called laser star and one is called air laser.

261
00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:47.415
Air laser is an air born laser weapon.

262
00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:48.843
Laser star, I've never been able

263
00:13:48.843 --> 00:13:50.956
to figure out quite what it is.

264
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:55.956
His third project is, I read the literature on it repeatedly

265
00:13:56.564 --> 00:13:58.027
and I cannot figure it out,

266
00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:01.196
but its code name, the name for the project,

267
00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:04.505
is an acronym like HAARP is A-A-R-P,

268
00:14:04.505 --> 00:14:09.505
Well, this is Mayhem.

269
00:14:10.075 --> 00:14:13.744
The "M" is munition, I figured that part out.

270
00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:17.006
HAARP, the civilian science project,

271
00:14:17.006 --> 00:14:18.817
is being developed by a guy

272
00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:22.951
who's working on two weapon laser projects

273
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:26.817
and some sort of a munition named Mayhem.

274
00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:29.266
<v Regina>There are also universities involved,</v>

275
00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:32.030
MIT, UCLA, some very prestigious universities

276
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.861
in terms of technological development.

277
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:38.996
<v ->Who's involved in the project changes from year to year,</v>

278
00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:42.676
but it's been running about 12 to 16 universities,

279
00:14:42.676 --> 00:14:45.613
Some nongovernmental organizations, NGO's,

280
00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:50.083
such as SRI, Stanford Research.

281
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:54.077
There are some big players in this thing.

282
00:14:54.077 --> 00:14:58.951
Again, you're right, it appears to be civilian.

283
00:14:58.951 --> 00:15:01.489
They insist that it is completely above board,

284
00:15:01.489 --> 00:15:02.778
there's nothing secret about it,

285
00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:07.433
it's just a little civilian research installation

286
00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:10.731
out in Alaska, it's not a harm to anybody,

287
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.731
it's not a weapon, don't look behind the green curtain.

288
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Regina>Don't worry about it.</v>

289
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.045
Don't look behind the green curtain.

290
00:15:18.045 --> 00:15:22.039
Yet, it is repeatedly listed as one of the top

291
00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:25.782
under-reported stories and subjects.

292
00:15:25.782 --> 00:15:28.383
<v ->Obviously the "don't look behind the green curtain"</v>

293
00:15:28.383 --> 00:15:33.077
is working.

294
00:15:33.077 --> 00:15:35.293
It's had very minimal reportage

295
00:15:35.293 --> 00:15:37.859
in the mainstream press.

296
00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:40.994
The way mainstream press works is

297
00:15:40.994 --> 00:15:43.931
the local newspaper covers local stories.

298
00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:45.568
So, you have national news.

299
00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:47.635
National news doesn't cover--

300
00:15:47.635 --> 00:15:51.768
You know, you got 30 minutes, you got a few seconds

301
00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:54.508
for each of 20 stories they run,

302
00:15:54.508 --> 00:15:56.876
and if you don't have good pictures,

303
00:15:56.876 --> 00:15:59.709
if it doesn't have an immediacy,

304
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.078
if it doesn't have some sort of visceral,

305
00:16:02.078 --> 00:16:04.411
there are 20 people dead,

306
00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:09.411
or a ferry has sunk, it doesn't get air time.

307
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.686
HAARP did appear in Popular Science.

308
00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:17.867
That's about as big as it got.

309
00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:20.410
<v Regina>Considering the nature of the agencies involved,</v>

310
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.000
the university involvement, etc.,

311
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.170
it certainly would seem under-reported.

312
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.840
Let's take the lineage of the science

313
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.278
back a little bit further.

314
00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:32.275
There was initially involvement also

315
00:16:32.275 --> 00:16:33.843
with the Russian govermnment

316
00:16:33.843 --> 00:16:36.163
before Perestroika.
<v ->Right, right.</v>

317
00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:39.878
<v Regina>Can you talk about that a little bit?</v>

318
00:16:39.878 --> 00:16:43.594
<v ->This appears to be pure Star Wars.</v>

319
00:16:43.594 --> 00:16:48.594
What we know is that HAARP says

320
00:16:49.097 --> 00:16:52.429
we're not the APTI patents,

321
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.937
but it's clear that they are the APTI patents.

322
00:16:54.937 --> 00:16:59.778
Now, the project at APTI was headed up by

323
00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:01.810
a Dr. Bernard Eastlund.

324
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.349
Bernard Eastlund has been working on weapons systems

325
00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.784
that ARCO can make money from for decades.

326
00:17:10.784 --> 00:17:15.022
One of his earlier patents, which is very similar to HAARP,

327
00:17:15.022 --> 00:17:17.793
is a patent for creating plasmas at the top

328
00:17:17.793 --> 00:17:20.927
of the atmosphere and sending those plasmas out into space.

329
00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:24.701
The plasmas would then be electrically charged clouds

330
00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:27.336
that would get caught between the magnetic lines of force

331
00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:30.866
and any sort of IBM or spacecraft coming through it

332
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.677
would get fried out.

333
00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.080
He applied for that about 1981,

334
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.448
received it in about 1991,

335
00:17:37.448 --> 00:17:39.248
and as soon as he received that

336
00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:42.187
he went on to do the HAARP patents.

337
00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:47.187
The HAARP patents, there's 12 of them in the portfolio.

338
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.590
Again, it's controversial as to how this thing started.

339
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.459
There are several different people who said,

340
00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:56.700
"It was my idea!"

341
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.163
There's a guy named Jim Phelps,

342
00:17:58.163 --> 00:17:59.637
which I find it an interesting name

343
00:17:59.637 --> 00:18:04.211
because thats the head of the mission impossible force,

344
00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:06.638
Jim Phelps at DARPA said it was his idea,

345
00:18:06.638 --> 00:18:11.638
and that he got his people at DARPA to push for this thing.

346
00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:15.148
Meanwhile, some guys at the Air Force say

347
00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:17.482
that they had coffee and donuts one morning

348
00:18:17.482 --> 00:18:20.825
with the guys at naval research at ONR

349
00:18:20.825 --> 00:18:22.962
and they kicked this idea around and decide,

350
00:18:22.962 --> 00:18:25.191
"Hey, this sounds like something we need,"

351
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:27.234
and they went over to DARPA and asked DARPA,

352
00:18:27.234 --> 00:18:30.264
"Hey, can you help us with this thing?"

353
00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:34.579
Meanwhile, Senator Ted Stevens, who is

354
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:38.836
the head of the defense

355
00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:40.646
appropriations committee in the Senate,

356
00:18:40.646 --> 00:18:42.975
he says that scientists from the

357
00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:45.379
University of Alaska came to him and said,

358
00:18:45.379 --> 00:18:48.002
"We think we can harness the power

359
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:51.276
"of the Aurora for civilian good."

360
00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:53.053
They describe to him--

361
00:18:53.053 --> 00:18:56.977
This brings us back to one of the other uses for this thing,

362
00:18:56.977 --> 00:19:01.977
is with radio, an antenna has to be longer

363
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.670
than the wave you're generating.

364
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.606
The lower the frequency, the longer the wave.

365
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:14.606
To generate really, really, really low frequencies, like

366
00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:17.977
3 hertz, 12 hertz, you have to have antennas

367
00:19:17.977 --> 00:19:20.415
tens of thousands of miles long,

368
00:19:20.415 --> 00:19:24.083
and it's not practical to do that.

369
00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:26.289
The Navy got in on this project.

370
00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:27.668
The ONR guy--
<v Regina>The civilian</v>

371
00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.036
project.
<v ->Yes.</v>

372
00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:32.955
This coffee and donuts beginning of it, as the Navy say,

373
00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:33.900
"Hey, we need some way to talk to

374
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.897
"our deeply submerged submarines.

375
00:19:35.897 --> 00:19:40.897
"We need to create an antenna 30,000 miles long.

376
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:42.341
"Where are we gonna get one?"

377
00:19:42.341 --> 00:19:46.904
Well, there is the electrojet.

378
00:19:46.904 --> 00:19:49.237
The sun is an ongoing nuclear explosion

379
00:19:49.237 --> 00:19:51.132
blowing bits of atoms at the earth.

380
00:19:51.132 --> 00:19:53.419
These bits of atoms, when they reach the earth,

381
00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:56.357
they get trapped in the magnetic lines of force

382
00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:57.576
around the earth.

383
00:19:57.576 --> 00:19:59.990
They bounce back and forth between the lines,

384
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.429
they spiral around the lines, and they bounce back and forth

385
00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:04.054
from the north pole to the south pole,

386
00:20:04.054 --> 00:20:05.830
thousands of miles out in space.

387
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.291
As they're bouncing back and forth,

388
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:11.068
the earth gets an electrical charge.

389
00:20:11.068 --> 00:20:12.969
They build up a charge, kind of like

390
00:20:12.969 --> 00:20:15.442
rubbing a cat on a windy day.

391
00:20:15.442 --> 00:20:20.442
Just as the cat is gonna discharge by clawing you for it,

392
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:25.148
this flow of electrons comes back to earth at the poles

393
00:20:25.148 --> 00:20:27.354
and it comes in so hot, so hard, so fast,

394
00:20:27.354 --> 00:20:30.222
it heats the atmosphere up causing it to glow.

395
00:20:30.222 --> 00:20:32.451
That's the northern lights, that's the Aurora.

396
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:35.493
This flow of electrons is called the electrojet.

397
00:20:35.493 --> 00:20:36.863
The Navy got this bright idea,

398
00:20:36.863 --> 00:20:39.031
why don't we tune the electrojet?

399
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:42.445
Why don't we turn the electrojet into a virtual antenna

400
00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:44.269
40,000 miles long and then we can talk

401
00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:47.172
to submarines five miles down?

402
00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:48.333
<v Regina>This begs the question,</v>

403
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:50.504
if you're talking to submarines five miles down,

404
00:20:50.504 --> 00:20:52.779
what is it doing to the marine life,

405
00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:55.577
such as dolphins, whales, and their delicate sonar?

406
00:20:55.577 --> 00:21:00.020
<v ->Right, the sonar is an entirely different subject.</v>

407
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.480
There is a new generation of long range sonars

408
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.480
they've been testing for about three, four years now.

409
00:21:09.631 --> 00:21:12.265
If you've ever stood at the end of an airport runway

410
00:21:12.265 --> 00:21:15.029
and listened to the big jets coming in,

411
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:20.029
these sonars are 500,000 times louder than a 747

412
00:21:20.892 --> 00:21:23.643
1,000 feet over your head.

413
00:21:23.643 --> 00:21:27.501
They are unbelievable loud, they're inconceivably loud.

414
00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:31.307
One of the tests,

415
00:21:31.307 --> 00:21:33.527
they had a submarine

416
00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:36.790
just outside the bay at San Diego,

417
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.356
and they had another submarine at Diego Garcia,

418
00:21:39.356 --> 00:21:42.872
on the other side of the world in the middle of the

419
00:21:42.872 --> 00:21:46.957
Indian Ocean and they heard each other.

420
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:49.659
<v Regina>Are you saying this is a separate project?</v>

421
00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:51.702
<v ->Completely different technology.</v>

422
00:21:51.702 --> 00:21:53.664
<v Regina>So, the technology that you're speaking of,</v>

423
00:21:53.664 --> 00:21:57.530
in terms of this tomography, has nothing to do

424
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.978
with any disturbance of the creatures under the water,

425
00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:04.682
or does it?

426
00:22:04.682 --> 00:22:05.947
Two different things?

427
00:22:05.947 --> 00:22:09.349
<v ->I think we're in five different subjects at this point.</v>

428
00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:11.451
<v Regina>Okay, we probably are.</v>

429
00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:12.890
Let's just narrow it back down.

430
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.225
<v ->I can answer that question and that'll just</v>

431
00:22:14.225 --> 00:22:16.327
give us another subject to talk about.

432
00:22:16.327 --> 00:22:20.100
<v Regina>We'll save the environmental aspect until later.</v>

433
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.293
<v ->You were going back to the beginning of the project.</v>

434
00:22:23.293 --> 00:22:25.499
<v Regina>The beginning of the project, and again,</v>

435
00:22:25.499 --> 00:22:27.403
going back further into the Russian--

436
00:22:27.403 --> 00:22:28.657
<v ->Yeah, the Russians, right.</v>

437
00:22:28.657 --> 00:22:32.043
What I was setting up here, is that

438
00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:34.238
this appears to be Star Wars.

439
00:22:34.238 --> 00:22:38.545
This appears to be a ground based Star Wars weapon system.

440
00:22:38.545 --> 00:22:41.920
At the beginning of Star Wars, the Russians freaked out,

441
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.751
they totally freaked out, because what this would do is

442
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:47.226
this would shift the balance of power.

443
00:22:47.226 --> 00:22:52.125
We'd always had MAD, mutual assured destruction.

444
00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:54.261
This would shift the balance of power to give us

445
00:22:54.261 --> 00:22:57.233
a first strike capability.

446
00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:00.600
The Russians really does not want us to have

447
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.737
a first strike capability.

448
00:23:02.737 --> 00:23:07.737
When it looked like if we could shield ourselves from them,

449
00:23:07.903 --> 00:23:10.515
we could just blow them away.

450
00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:15.345
Reagan promised, as a way to smooth

451
00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:17.690
the ruffled feathers of the Russians,

452
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.792
he promised, "We'll share it with you.

453
00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:23.089
"Whatever we find, we'll just pass onto you guys."

454
00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:27.059
The head of the Russian space program

455
00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:31.355
was brought in at the beginning of HAARP.

456
00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:36.355
Clearly indicating that there was a connection here.

457
00:23:36.603 --> 00:23:40.980
DARPA, who was asked initially to start this project,

458
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.650
DARPA started holding a series of seminars

459
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.843
at a number of universities and military think tanks

460
00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:48.712
around the country.

461
00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:51.550
The Russian head of their space program,

462
00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.057
their equivalent of NASA commander, came over

463
00:23:55.057 --> 00:23:58.690
and was in several of these conferences.

464
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.690
We were passing the idea to them at that point in time.

465
00:24:03.764 --> 00:24:08.564
<v Regina>So, we have the implication, not only, of our own</v>

466
00:24:08.564 --> 00:24:11.334
university system in the military, but also the

467
00:24:11.334 --> 00:24:16.334
Russian science community behind this civilian project.

468
00:24:16.477 --> 00:24:18.613
<v ->The civilian project.</v>

469
00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:21.582
Nikola Tesla was absolutely the greatest genius

470
00:24:21.582 --> 00:24:25.491
of his generation, possibly of his century.

471
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:27.116
<v Regina>We're looking at a time frame</v>

472
00:24:27.116 --> 00:24:28.659
of the turn of the last century.

473
00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:30.589
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>Early 1900's.</v>

474
00:24:30.589 --> 00:24:35.589
He started about

475
00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:38.395
1880

476
00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:43.331
and worked through to--

477
00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:47.470
It's a great story, but it's a long story.

478
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.771
<v Regina>Can you shorten it</v>

479
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:49.978
sense we have so much to cover?

480
00:24:49.978 --> 00:24:51.682
<v ->Most of his work was about a 30 year period,</v>

481
00:24:51.682 --> 00:24:56.027
from about 1880 to about 1912.

482
00:24:58.787 --> 00:25:02.816
His greatest inventions were alternating current.

483
00:25:02.816 --> 00:25:06.217
The civilization we live in runs on AC power.

484
00:25:06.217 --> 00:25:08.226
When you plug into the wall,

485
00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:10.293
that's AC that you're getting out.

486
00:25:10.293 --> 00:25:15.293
Prior to Tesla, the electrical theory said

487
00:25:15.668 --> 00:25:17.108
you couldn't use AC.

488
00:25:17.108 --> 00:25:19.836
They knew it existed, but it was like it was too dangerous,

489
00:25:19.836 --> 00:25:21.830
it was too crazy.

490
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.444
They didn't have the technology to work with.

491
00:25:23.444 --> 00:25:26.752
They said no, it's a mad man's idea,

492
00:25:26.752 --> 00:25:31.752
and everything was being done in direct current.

493
00:25:31.756 --> 00:25:33.358
<v Regina>Thomas Edison though was given</v>

494
00:25:33.358 --> 00:25:34.682
the credit for that one.

495
00:25:34.682 --> 00:25:38.896
<v ->Thomas Edison was powering New York City</v>

496
00:25:38.896 --> 00:25:42.228
with power plants that were ten stories tall

497
00:25:42.228 --> 00:25:44.330
by an entire city block and they could run

498
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.604
about a square mile.

499
00:25:47.604 --> 00:25:51.911
Tesla came in, put one power plant at Niagra Falls

500
00:25:51.911 --> 00:25:54.640
and powered the entire state.

501
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.031
Almost put Edison out of business.

502
00:25:57.031 --> 00:25:59.179
In fact, the multi-national corporation

503
00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:03.846
GE, General Electric, was created by Edison,

504
00:26:03.846 --> 00:26:08.386
to lease the rights to Tesla's AC patents.

505
00:26:08.386 --> 00:26:11.346
Of the 46 basic patents in AC,

506
00:26:11.346 --> 00:26:13.382
Tesla holds 45 of them.

507
00:26:13.382 --> 00:26:14.840
(laughing)
<v Regina>And yet he wasn't</v>

508
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.940
given credit for them.

509
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.324
<v ->Exactly.</v>

510
00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:20.807
On top of that, Edison is given credit

511
00:26:20.807 --> 00:26:23.037
for having invented the light bulb.

512
00:26:23.037 --> 00:26:25.579
He was on the golf course.

513
00:26:25.579 --> 00:26:28.644
What had happened was is

514
00:26:28.644 --> 00:26:32.812
Tesla had developed 16 different types of lighting

515
00:26:32.812 --> 00:26:37.812
and had his laboratory brilliantly electrically illuminated

516
00:26:38.884 --> 00:26:43.884
and he had a contract with George Westinghouse.

517
00:26:44.422 --> 00:26:46.524
George Westinghouse is a very famous name.

518
00:26:46.524 --> 00:26:49.496
Many of us have Westinghouse appliances.

519
00:26:49.496 --> 00:26:51.237
Westinghouse was an inventor himself

520
00:26:51.237 --> 00:26:55.672
and owned this production company to build his gizmos.

521
00:26:55.672 --> 00:26:57.669
He worked out a deal with Tesla that

522
00:26:57.669 --> 00:27:00.305
Tesla would do the science, figure it out,

523
00:27:00.305 --> 00:27:03.047
and then Westinghouse could make all the gimcracks

524
00:27:03.047 --> 00:27:05.375
he could think of.

525
00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:08.382
Edison realized that these guys were going to get

526
00:27:08.382 --> 00:27:11.923
an electric light bulb on the market any day now.

527
00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:16.923
He put his laboratory on round the clock crash program.

528
00:27:16.997 --> 00:27:20.584
Find it, find something I can get on the market.

529
00:27:20.584 --> 00:27:25.584
He did succeed and one of his guys did find it.

530
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:28.305
The name of the guy who invented the electric light bulb

531
00:27:28.305 --> 00:27:29.838
is lost to history.

532
00:27:29.838 --> 00:27:33.472
There is a notation in the Menlo Lab's

533
00:27:33.472 --> 00:27:36.606
account ledger that $5 was paid out to someone

534
00:27:36.606 --> 00:27:38.684
as a bonus for finding the light bulb,

535
00:27:38.684 --> 00:27:42.415
(laughing)
but they didn't record who.

536
00:27:42.415 --> 00:27:43.786
As well as that, Tesla also invented--

537
00:27:43.786 --> 00:27:45.794
<v Regina>Radio Frequency.</v>
<v ->Exactly.</v>

538
00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:46.784
<v Regina>I wanted to get into that next.</v>

539
00:27:46.784 --> 00:27:49.004
<v ->Tesla also discovered radio.</v>

540
00:27:49.004 --> 00:27:52.331
The very first demonstration of radio

541
00:27:52.331 --> 00:27:55.129
was a radio controlled boat

542
00:27:55.129 --> 00:27:58.600
in a pond at Madison Square Garden.

543
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.899
Why does Marconi?

544
00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:05.899
What happened was, is Marconi went to Tesla,

545
00:28:07.131 --> 00:28:09.975
Tesla is, I think, about this time in his late 20's,

546
00:28:09.975 --> 00:28:13.284
early 30's, Marconi is in his early 20's.

547
00:28:13.284 --> 00:28:14.445
he goes to Tesla and says,

548
00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:16.790
"Mr. Tesla, you're the greatest genius of the age.

549
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.323
"I so admire your work. Can I please work for you?"

550
00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:21.956
Tesla said, "Well, sure. Cool.

551
00:28:21.956 --> 00:28:23.558
"There's a table,"

552
00:28:23.558 --> 00:28:26.856
and Marconi worked for him for about nine months

553
00:28:26.856 --> 00:28:29.967
and copied everything.

554
00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:32.196
Pure industrial espionage.

555
00:28:32.196 --> 00:28:35.226
He stole everything he could out of the lab,

556
00:28:35.226 --> 00:28:37.107
all the intellectual property he could get his hands on,

557
00:28:37.107 --> 00:28:41.473
he walked off with, got funding, invented his own radio.

558
00:28:41.473 --> 00:28:45.710
Tesla sued him at the United States Supreme Court and won

559
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.649
with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that

560
00:28:47.649 --> 00:28:52.649
Marconi had pirated 14 of Tesla's patents.

561
00:28:53.187 --> 00:28:56.159
The question is, is HAARP Tesla technology?

562
00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:59.456
Well, HAARP is radio. That's Tesla Technology.

563
00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:04.456
HAARP uses direct current,

564
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.600
so it's not directly.

565
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:11.600
Another aspect of this is that HAARP

566
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.677
is designed to effect the ionosphere,

567
00:29:14.677 --> 00:29:17.080
which Tesla did not believe existed.

568
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.945
Tesla, at the time it was discovered by Oliver Heaviside,

569
00:29:21.945 --> 00:29:24.383
and it was called the Heaviside layer.

570
00:29:24.383 --> 00:29:27.692
Tesla did not believe the Heaviside layer existed.

571
00:29:27.692 --> 00:29:29.758
He's been proven wrong on that.

572
00:29:29.758 --> 00:29:34.681
Tesla did come up with the idea that directly sending

573
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:37.363
electrical energy into the stratosphere,

574
00:29:37.363 --> 00:29:38.896
which is the zone between,

575
00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:41.264
weather happens in the troposphere,

576
00:29:41.264 --> 00:29:42.622
and then there's the stratosphere

577
00:29:42.622 --> 00:29:44.503
which is where the ozone layer lives,

578
00:29:44.503 --> 00:29:47.313
and then above that is the ionosphere.

579
00:29:47.313 --> 00:29:50.006
Tesla thought that by sending the electricity

580
00:29:50.006 --> 00:29:52.375
into the stratosphere, you could actually get it to glow.

581
00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:54.511
He thought, well, we don't need street lights.

582
00:29:54.511 --> 00:29:59.511
We could energize the air over cities at night.

583
00:30:00.585 --> 00:30:02.322
It's a little bit like Tesla,

584
00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:03.819
and a little bit not like Tesla.

585
00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:07.929
<v Regina>Okay, let's come up to current time.</v>

586
00:30:07.929 --> 00:30:10.228
This array is still under development,

587
00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:12.504
this array of antennas.

588
00:30:12.504 --> 00:30:16.207
What are, now, we've talked about the heating

589
00:30:16.207 --> 00:30:19.075
of the ionosphere, what are some of the other applications,

590
00:30:19.075 --> 00:30:22.477
and again, you've already talked about military applications

591
00:30:22.477 --> 00:30:25.416
in terms of communications, what other potentials

592
00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:27.146
are there in this?

593
00:30:27.146 --> 00:30:31.186
<v ->The official, what it's being paid to do,</v>

594
00:30:31.186 --> 00:30:34.042
is inject energy into the top of the atmosphere

595
00:30:34.042 --> 00:30:36.225
to mimic what the sun does.

596
00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:38.988
The sun has these ongoing nuclear explosions

597
00:30:38.988 --> 00:30:40.996
and it is an ongoing nuclear furnace,

598
00:30:40.996 --> 00:30:43.133
and it has these coronal ejections.

599
00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:46.496
The sun has these solar flares that are blowing

600
00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:49.271
great quantities of energy at the earth.

601
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:53.706
When the solar flares, when the bits of charged atoms

602
00:30:53.706 --> 00:30:58.706
arrive at the atmosphere, it impacts the atmosphere.

603
00:30:58.849 --> 00:31:02.112
It hits the ozone layer and does things.

604
00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:04.515
One of the things they're trying to do with HAARP

605
00:31:04.515 --> 00:31:07.325
is inject energy into the atmosphere in a spot

606
00:31:07.325 --> 00:31:11.644
where they can train their diagnostic instruments on it

607
00:31:11.644 --> 00:31:13.385
and they can see what it does.

608
00:31:13.385 --> 00:31:17.399
One HAARP reviewer said what they wanna do

609
00:31:17.399 --> 00:31:20.000
is kick mother nature in the pants

610
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.101
and see what she does.

611
00:31:22.101 --> 00:31:23.599
<v Regina>Wise.</v>

612
00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:25.793
<v ->That's one of the reason's it exists.</v>

613
00:31:25.793 --> 00:31:29.079
Another, again, is to do this earth penetrating tomography.

614
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:33.247
Which, if they can get it to work,

615
00:31:33.247 --> 00:31:37.055
HAARP is going to bathe about 80% of the globe

616
00:31:37.055 --> 00:31:40.515
in extremely low frequency radiation that will penetrate

617
00:31:40.515 --> 00:31:43.429
a mile or two deep, that if they got the right guys,

618
00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:45.495
with the right equipment, in the right spot,

619
00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:49.060
they can find and monitor enemy underground bases

620
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.927
where they manufacture and launch

621
00:31:51.927 --> 00:31:55.672
of weapons of mass destruction.

622
00:31:55.672 --> 00:31:59.410
This is the primary thing it was funded for.

623
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.641
I know it sounds like science fiction,

624
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:02.429
but that's why it's there.

625
00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:04.449
<v Regina>From what my understanding is,</v>

626
00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:05.575
there's another area that sounds

627
00:32:05.575 --> 00:32:07.317
even more like science fiction

628
00:32:07.317 --> 00:32:10.277
in that it broadcasts, these ELF waves,

629
00:32:10.277 --> 00:32:12.286
broadcast at basically

630
00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:14.457
a human biological--
<v ->That's where I was going.</v>

631
00:32:14.457 --> 00:32:16.094
<v Regina>Level of the brain. Okay.</v>

632
00:32:16.094 --> 00:32:17.650
<v ->You were asking me about applications.</v>

633
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.892
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

634
00:32:18.892 --> 00:32:20.796
<v ->We haven't got to downsides yet.</v>

635
00:32:20.796 --> 00:32:22.398
Another application, another thing

636
00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:24.569
it's officially funded for is communicating

637
00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:26.833
with deeply submerged submarines

638
00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:30.304
by tuning the electrojet.

639
00:32:30.304 --> 00:32:33.741
Tuning the electrojet means you are actually

640
00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:37.816
working with a big earth system.

641
00:32:37.816 --> 00:32:42.816
You're actually effecting the earth's magnetic field,

642
00:32:42.983 --> 00:32:47.983
and again, you're doing it by creating these ELF's,

643
00:32:48.114 --> 00:32:50.053
extremely low frequencies.

644
00:32:50.053 --> 00:32:51.017
The point you brought up

645
00:32:51.017 --> 00:32:53.966
and the one that made the light bulb go on over my head

646
00:32:53.966 --> 00:32:57.971
when I heard about HAARP was that these two technologies,

647
00:32:57.971 --> 00:33:00.038
earth penetrating tomography and talking

648
00:33:00.038 --> 00:33:01.628
to deeply submerged submarines,

649
00:33:01.628 --> 00:33:04.670
both involve bathing the earth in ELF

650
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.001
at exactly the same frequency that the human brain works at.

651
00:33:09.001 --> 00:33:14.001
My first thought was if it is exactly what it says it is,

652
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.519
do they have any biological scientists on the program?

653
00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:21.087
No.

654
00:33:21.087 --> 00:33:24.163
There's nobody on the program who has any clue

655
00:33:24.163 --> 00:33:29.163
what this technology, what kind of technology,

656
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:32.162
how this technology will effect living things.

657
00:33:32.162 --> 00:33:34.659
They did an environmental impact study

658
00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.505
and the environmental impact study said,

659
00:33:36.505 --> 00:33:38.966
"Oh, no problem. Go for it."

660
00:33:38.966 --> 00:33:43.966
So, they don't have anybody on board officially.

661
00:33:45.015 --> 00:33:50.015
I thought in terms of unintended consequences,

662
00:33:50.146 --> 00:33:53.722
if you are beaming radio frequencies

663
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:57.495
at known brain entrainment frequencies.

664
00:33:57.495 --> 00:33:59.063
<v Regina>Explain the word entrainment.</v>

665
00:33:59.063 --> 00:34:02.058
<v ->The human brain is a radio transceiver.</v>

666
00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:06.865
It emits a weak radio signal

667
00:34:06.865 --> 00:34:11.509
and has been shown to be effected by external radio signals.

668
00:34:11.509 --> 00:34:14.910
That's entrainment.

669
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:16.814
There are a lot of these brain boost

670
00:34:16.814 --> 00:34:19.612
and instant meditation machines.

671
00:34:19.612 --> 00:34:22.341
They use a number of technologies.

672
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:24.523
There are some that use flashing lights,

673
00:34:24.523 --> 00:34:29.523
some that use acoustic

674
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.093
tones that are embedded in music

675
00:34:32.093 --> 00:34:35.671
and you put on the headphones and you listen to this.

676
00:34:35.671 --> 00:34:39.535
Some use direct electrical stimulation of the brain.

677
00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:41.143
They put electrodes on you

678
00:34:41.143 --> 00:34:45.206
and the electrodes send a signal into the brain

679
00:34:45.206 --> 00:34:47.911
and the brain mimics that.

680
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:50.071
It goes into harmony.

681
00:34:50.071 --> 00:34:55.071
It gets tuned to it and you can dial your mental state.

682
00:34:56.387 --> 00:34:59.115
You can roll yourself up to a very agitated level,

683
00:34:59.115 --> 00:35:03.492
or drop yourself down into levels that are good

684
00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:08.492
for accessing deep seeded memory, lucid dreaming,

685
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.525
you can do some pretty wild things with this stuff.

686
00:35:12.525 --> 00:35:17.099
If we're gonna put a brain entrainment machine

687
00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:21.371
on the heads of everybody on the planet simultaneously

688
00:35:21.371 --> 00:35:23.647
and not know we're doing it, this could have

689
00:35:23.647 --> 00:35:26.886
some really unintended consequences.

690
00:35:26.886 --> 00:35:29.382
Then, on the other hand, if they do know what they're doing.

691
00:35:29.382 --> 00:35:30.590
<v Regina>I was going to ask that next.</v>

692
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.714
Is it possible there are intended consequences

693
00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:36.183
and what might that be?

694
00:35:36.183 --> 00:35:41.183
<v ->I spend a lot of pages in my book</v>

695
00:35:41.662 --> 00:35:45.668
on the history of mind control.

696
00:35:45.668 --> 00:35:50.236
Mind control goes back to the 1880s.

697
00:35:50.236 --> 00:35:54.036
Virtually all the sciences that we use today

698
00:35:54.036 --> 00:35:58.808
all had their births between 1840 and 1880

699
00:35:58.808 --> 00:36:02.348
and psychiatry, psychology,

700
00:36:02.348 --> 00:36:07.348
those were born between 1840 and 1880.

701
00:36:07.402 --> 00:36:09.796
As soon as they got the idea

702
00:36:09.796 --> 00:36:13.790
that we may have a handle on how the mind works,

703
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.229
they immediately starting using it,

704
00:36:15.229 --> 00:36:19.060
well, how can we control the mind?

705
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.503
Governments have invested billions of dollars

706
00:36:26.503 --> 00:36:28.906
in finding ways to control the mind.

707
00:36:28.906 --> 00:36:30.148
<v Regina>The Soviets were real</v>

708
00:36:30.148 --> 00:36:31.309
leaders in that--
<v ->They were.</v>

709
00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:32.969
<v Regina>During the Cold War, but the U.S.</v>

710
00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:34.618
wasn't far behind, were they?

711
00:36:34.618 --> 00:36:39.314
<v ->It depends on who you listen to.</v>

712
00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:41.957
The head of the CIA,

713
00:36:41.957 --> 00:36:45.407
one of the heads of the CIA, Cohen, told Congress,

714
00:36:45.407 --> 00:36:47.328
"I need more money to do mind control

715
00:36:47.328 --> 00:36:50.370
"research because the Soviets are ahead of us."

716
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:54.433
Five years later, the next head of the CIA tells Congress

717
00:36:54.433 --> 00:36:58.439
we are doing wonderful, we're way ahead of the Soviets now.

718
00:36:58.439 --> 00:37:01.213
Maybe we caught up.

719
00:37:01.213 --> 00:37:04.545
The Soviet research started in

720
00:37:04.545 --> 00:37:07.610
the late 1920s or early 1930s,

721
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.188
and one of the early experiments they did

722
00:37:10.188 --> 00:37:14.251
was hypnotizing someone, giving them a command phrase

723
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:16.457
that would then have them do something,

724
00:37:16.457 --> 00:37:20.927
and then trying to use radio

725
00:37:20.927 --> 00:37:25.826
to trigger them at a distance.

726
00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:27.626
I thought, HAARP could be an

727
00:37:27.626 --> 00:37:32.626
amazing improvement on that idea.

728
00:37:33.934 --> 00:37:35.379
One of the things that we know

729
00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:38.850
that both the Soviets and the U.S. were working on

730
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.647
were sleeper agents, hypnotic sleeper agents.

731
00:37:42.647 --> 00:37:45.990
You may have seen the movie Telefon with Charles Bronson.

732
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.883
He's a hypnotic sleeper agent.

733
00:37:47.883 --> 00:37:50.689
He's just a normal guy and he gets these phone calls,

734
00:37:50.689 --> 00:37:52.663
and when the phone call happens,

735
00:37:52.663 --> 00:37:54.218
the command phrase is triggered

736
00:37:54.218 --> 00:37:56.366
and he goes off and, I think in the movie

737
00:37:56.366 --> 00:38:00.419
he was assassinating people.

738
00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:05.419
One scenario proposed by a professor at

739
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:15.411
Colgate Institue, Colgate University,

740
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:17.749
Dr. Estabrook.

741
00:38:17.749 --> 00:38:21.426
Dr. Estabrook, at the time, was like America's

742
00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:23.853
leading expert in hypnosis.

743
00:38:23.853 --> 00:38:28.067
He suggested to the U.S. Army that what they could do

744
00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:32.665
is they could infiltrate a few hypnotists

745
00:38:32.665 --> 00:38:37.274
into key positions in the enemy territory, like dentists,

746
00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:41.744
and you have these dentists who are your hypnotic doctors.

747
00:38:41.744 --> 00:38:43.543
All their patients who come in,

748
00:38:43.543 --> 00:38:45.982
they don't just get an extraction,

749
00:38:45.982 --> 00:38:50.982
they get hypnotized, given a command, given a program,

750
00:38:50.985 --> 00:38:54.526
given something to do, put LSD in the water supply,

751
00:38:54.526 --> 00:38:58.288
or blow up the train tracks, and they're sent out.

752
00:38:58.288 --> 00:39:00.889
Of course, you have to bring them back every six months

753
00:39:00.889 --> 00:39:02.700
to get their teeth cleaned

754
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.566
and the command instructions reinstalled in them.

755
00:39:06.566 --> 00:39:07.704
<v Regina>Now, how does this potentially</v>

756
00:39:07.704 --> 00:39:09.847
interface with HAARP then?

757
00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.377
<v ->Over a period of time, you got these guys,</v>

758
00:39:12.377 --> 00:39:15.001
you got a hundred doctors hypnotizing everybody

759
00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:17.172
who comes into the office for 20 years,

760
00:39:17.172 --> 00:39:20.411
you got a hundred thousand, a million soldiers,

761
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:21.746
waiting to be activated.

762
00:39:21.746 --> 00:39:24.324
Well, how do you activate a million soldiers at once?

763
00:39:24.324 --> 00:39:27.249
Today, we have these demon dialers that you can

764
00:39:27.249 --> 00:39:30.129
ring every phone in the neighborhood simultaneously

765
00:39:30.129 --> 00:39:34.761
and a recorded message can hit all your neighbors at once,

766
00:39:34.761 --> 00:39:36.700
but they didn't have that back in the '50s,

767
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.370
they didn't have that back in the '60s.

768
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.868
When they were developing this technology,

769
00:39:40.868 --> 00:39:43.233
we're looking at how are we gonna do this?

770
00:39:43.233 --> 00:39:48.233
HAARP may be able to transmit words.

771
00:39:48.377 --> 00:39:52.417
If you're sending a signal that's at the same frequency

772
00:39:52.417 --> 00:39:54.983
that the brain picks up,

773
00:39:54.983 --> 00:39:57.850
you may be able to send emotions or words.

774
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.416
If you can send words, you can send the command phrase.

775
00:40:00.416 --> 00:40:03.017
You could send your command phrase out,

776
00:40:03.017 --> 00:40:05.989
and then all your sleeper soldiers go off

777
00:40:05.989 --> 00:40:08.880
and do their thing all simultaneously.

778
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.526
I admit that's speculation,

779
00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:14.705
but it is a known desire

780
00:40:14.705 --> 00:40:18.467
and a known technology that fulfills the desire.

781
00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:20.208
<v Regina>And there is a history for this desire</v>

782
00:40:20.208 --> 00:40:22.914
because of previous research in the mind control.

783
00:40:22.914 --> 00:40:27.604
<v ->And published research, it's not just wild speculation.</v>

784
00:40:27.604 --> 00:40:30.089
This stuff is in the scientific literature.

785
00:40:30.089 --> 00:40:35.089
It's an openly published literature in scientific,

786
00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:39.337
medical journals, and in

787
00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:44.167
declassified military papers.

788
00:40:44.167 --> 00:40:47.306
<v Regina>So, we have the potential that large populations</v>

789
00:40:47.306 --> 00:40:50.975
of people could be targeted with this frequency

790
00:40:50.975 --> 00:40:52.438
and maybe tweak it a little bit

791
00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:54.713
or send certain pulse or information through it?

792
00:40:54.713 --> 00:40:56.141
<v ->Yeah.</v>

793
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:57.813
That's one of the things I look at

794
00:40:57.813 --> 00:40:59.299
at great length in the book.

795
00:40:59.299 --> 00:41:02.998
I spend about a hundred pages on it.

796
00:41:02.998 --> 00:41:06.715
I'd been studying mind control for a decade

797
00:41:06.715 --> 00:41:09.280
before writing the book.

798
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.608
When I read what HAARP was capable of doing,

799
00:41:12.608 --> 00:41:15.892
I immediately said, well this is the long sought

800
00:41:15.892 --> 00:41:17.495
holy grail of mind control,

801
00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:20.571
is a way to be able to get an entire continent all at once.

802
00:41:20.571 --> 00:41:23.334
Even if you can't get words out,

803
00:41:23.334 --> 00:41:25.378
you can get emotions.

804
00:41:25.378 --> 00:41:27.874
What if you could spread road rage

805
00:41:27.874 --> 00:41:29.941
across an entire continent?

806
00:41:29.941 --> 00:41:33.447
You could hit the Russians or the Americans

807
00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:38.447
with a violent emotion and they rip their cities apart

808
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:43.451
and kill each other and you just pick up the pieces.

809
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:48.880
<v Regina>The mind control element has a potential both,</v>

810
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.099
again, as a civilian project, and as a military project.

811
00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:56.838
<v ->Yup, you know, one of the things I kind of lost</v>

812
00:41:56.838 --> 00:41:59.868
when you were asking about the civilian aspect of this,

813
00:41:59.868 --> 00:42:03.014
is that there are these international treaties.

814
00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:04.349
There are a lot of international treaties

815
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:05.975
that U.S. is signatory to

816
00:42:05.975 --> 00:42:07.519
and there are several of which

817
00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:10.653
if HAARP were a military operation,

818
00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.616
if would be a violation of.

819
00:42:12.616 --> 00:42:16.656
Before George W. Bush became President,

820
00:42:16.656 --> 00:42:19.965
we were signatories to the ABM treaty.

821
00:42:19.965 --> 00:42:24.965
The ABM treaty allows each side to have one type

822
00:42:25.236 --> 00:42:28.103
of over-the-horizon radar.

823
00:42:28.103 --> 00:42:31.342
The over-the-horizon radar specified in the treaty

824
00:42:31.342 --> 00:42:33.502
cannot do certain things.

825
00:42:33.502 --> 00:42:37.256
It has to stay in a conceptual box.

826
00:42:37.256 --> 00:42:41.620
HAARP breaks the box. HAARP is steerable.

827
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.149
One of the rules is it cannot be steerable.

828
00:42:45.149 --> 00:42:47.216
HAARP has the potential to be used as an

829
00:42:47.216 --> 00:42:49.758
over-the-horizon radar.

830
00:42:49.758 --> 00:42:52.591
This is in the early literature on it.

831
00:42:52.591 --> 00:42:56.260
Then they went, "Oh. Oh, dear."

832
00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.731
<v Regina>This is a civilian project suddenly, right?</v>

833
00:42:59.731 --> 00:43:03.342
<v ->Right. Also, because HAARP does</v>

834
00:43:03.342 --> 00:43:05.664
have potential to effect weather.

835
00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:10.664
It's a rather distant potential, but it's still here.

836
00:43:11.202 --> 00:43:15.684
We are signatories to a treaty

837
00:43:15.684 --> 00:43:19.308
that prohibits using the weather

838
00:43:19.308 --> 00:43:22.558
as a military weapon.

839
00:43:22.558 --> 00:43:25.564
That's another treaty that they really didn't wanna

840
00:43:25.564 --> 00:43:28.756
get anybody upset about.

841
00:43:28.756 --> 00:43:33.702
It was just easier to make it a civilian science project.

842
00:43:33.702 --> 00:43:36.268
One of the things is that a lot of the universities

843
00:43:36.268 --> 00:43:39.542
that wanted in on the project, had strict rules

844
00:43:39.542 --> 00:43:43.106
about not working on military projects.

845
00:43:43.106 --> 00:43:44.476
Another way they got around it,

846
00:43:44.476 --> 00:43:47.414
they could get some of these ivy leagues

847
00:43:47.414 --> 00:43:49.178
to join in on the project is,

848
00:43:49.178 --> 00:43:52.650
"Oh, it's not us. We're not doing that."

849
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.692
On the other hand, it clearly is a military project

850
00:43:55.692 --> 00:43:59.964
that is wearing a civilian dress.

851
00:43:59.964 --> 00:44:02.634
<v Regina>So, we have this military project,</v>

852
00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:04.689
we've been speaking about the various applications,

853
00:44:04.689 --> 00:44:07.336
and we've talked a little bit about the potential downside,

854
00:44:07.336 --> 00:44:12.336
in terms of it operating in the spectrum of the human brain.

855
00:44:12.407 --> 00:44:16.749
What are some of the environmental potential downsides?

856
00:44:16.749 --> 00:44:21.749
<v ->One concern is migratory fowl.</v>

857
00:44:23.088 --> 00:44:28.088
HAARP is designed to have an impact on the electrojet,

858
00:44:30.425 --> 00:44:34.791
which is in the magnetic field, and may have a

859
00:44:34.791 --> 00:44:39.133
centergistic effect on the magnetic field itself.

860
00:44:39.133 --> 00:44:44.032
Now, migratory water fowl use the magnetic field

861
00:44:44.032 --> 00:44:49.032
as their way of travel.

862
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:52.748
In their nose, they have an organ.

863
00:44:52.748 --> 00:44:56.255
In our ear, we have this little hollow with a ball in it,

864
00:44:56.255 --> 00:44:57.985
and the ball rolls up and down,

865
00:44:57.985 --> 00:45:00.051
and we can tell whether we're standing up or sitting down

866
00:45:00.051 --> 00:45:01.351
by where the ball is.

867
00:45:01.351 --> 00:45:05.827
Well, some geese have a similar one in their nose

868
00:45:05.827 --> 00:45:08.892
with a ball of magnetite.

869
00:45:08.892 --> 00:45:13.892
Magnetite is a magnetized metal.

870
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:16.903
This little ball of magnetite that rolls around

871
00:45:16.903 --> 00:45:19.469
in their nose, and they have a built in compass.

872
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:21.779
We mess with the magnetic field,

873
00:45:21.779 --> 00:45:26.061
we could be sending all the Canadian Geese off to Jamaica.

874
00:45:26.061 --> 00:45:29.413
(laughing)

875
00:45:29.413 --> 00:45:31.648
Also, the human brain has been found

876
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:34.759
that every brain cell has magnetite in it.

877
00:45:34.759 --> 00:45:35.978
When you run into somebody who says,

878
00:45:35.978 --> 00:45:38.463
"I have a perfect sense of direction, I'm never lost,"

879
00:45:38.463 --> 00:45:40.692
they probably are telling you the truth,

880
00:45:40.692 --> 00:45:45.272
which means we could all end up walking into walls,

881
00:45:45.272 --> 00:45:49.365
in theory, if the magnetic field goes blooey.

882
00:45:49.365 --> 00:45:51.141
Another aspect of this is that we do know

883
00:45:51.141 --> 00:45:53.335
that for at least 5,000 years

884
00:45:53.335 --> 00:45:55.379
the earth's magnetic field has been declining,

885
00:45:55.379 --> 00:45:57.747
it's been losing strength.

886
00:45:57.747 --> 00:46:02.644
It looks like we may be in the beginning stages of

887
00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:06.048
a pole reversal, or a pole shift.

888
00:46:06.048 --> 00:46:10.412
We know that many pole shifts have occurred

889
00:46:10.412 --> 00:46:13.756
throughout the life of the planet.

890
00:46:13.756 --> 00:46:18.529
Pole shifts are devastating to living things

891
00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:23.529
because the magnetic field is

892
00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:29.140
part of what keeps solar radiation off of us.

893
00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.205
If the magnetic field goes down,

894
00:46:32.205 --> 00:46:35.143
then more radiation will get through to us

895
00:46:35.143 --> 00:46:39.682
and we will have more cancers, leukemias, or just die.

896
00:46:39.682 --> 00:46:42.708
<v Regina>How does HAARP interface, potentially, with that?</v>

897
00:46:42.708 --> 00:46:47.097
<v ->Because HAARP is going to be effecting in the region</v>

898
00:46:47.097 --> 00:46:50.731
of the magnetic field, we don't really know

899
00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:52.438
whether it's gonna have an effect or not.

900
00:46:52.438 --> 00:46:54.702
They did an environmental impact study and said,

901
00:46:54.702 --> 00:46:58.537
"Not gonna have any effect at all. Don't worry about it."

902
00:46:58.537 --> 00:47:03.514
The environmental impact study was incredibly flawed

903
00:47:03.514 --> 00:47:06.010
and probably should be regarded

904
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:10.352
as authoritative as toilet paper.

905
00:47:10.352 --> 00:47:11.251
<v Regina>Kind of junk science,</v>

906
00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:12.251
you're saying?
<v ->Exactly.</v>

907
00:47:12.251 --> 00:47:16.685
Very much so.

908
00:47:16.685 --> 00:47:21.685
It did not address any of the aspects of HAARP in use,

909
00:47:21.825 --> 00:47:23.625
beyond the actual towers.

910
00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:25.390
Again, HAARP is a field of antennas,

911
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:29.732
in which this field of the antennas are at the top of--

912
00:47:29.732 --> 00:47:31.209
the field is these towers.

913
00:47:31.209 --> 00:47:33.705
They're 72 feet tall with crossed

914
00:47:33.705 --> 00:47:36.747
antennas at the top of the towers.

915
00:47:36.747 --> 00:47:38.999
They measured, okay, if you're gonna walk

916
00:47:38.999 --> 00:47:41.109
around on the ground under the towers,

917
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:42.815
are you gonna get fried?

918
00:47:42.815 --> 00:47:44.081
That's what they measured.

919
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:45.788
That's the entire, that's the long and the short

920
00:47:45.788 --> 00:47:47.483
of the environmental impact study.

921
00:47:47.483 --> 00:47:50.292
They did address the migratory water fowl

922
00:47:50.292 --> 00:47:53.288
in that they didn't want them flying into the towers

923
00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:57.792
so they put colored streamers on the guy wires.

924
00:47:57.792 --> 00:48:01.972
That's the environmental mitigation

925
00:48:01.972 --> 00:48:05.185
that was involved in HAARP.

926
00:48:05.185 --> 00:48:09.640
<v Regina>This has an awful lot of implications,</v>

927
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.415
it sounds like.
<v ->Yes.</v>

928
00:48:12.415 --> 00:48:16.211
<v Regina>To living organisms, certainly in a</v>

929
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:18.684
military application level, etc.

930
00:48:18.684 --> 00:48:22.492
So, why are we not hearing anything about this project

931
00:48:22.492 --> 00:48:24.988
be it civilian or military?

932
00:48:24.988 --> 00:48:27.055
<v ->You know, that's a really, really good question.</v>

933
00:48:27.055 --> 00:48:29.632
If you find out the answer, please tell me.

934
00:48:29.632 --> 00:48:34.070
I was talking to a TV producer last night.

935
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.441
He had worked up a treatment

936
00:48:37.441 --> 00:48:42.441
and he was pitching a pilot for a show.

937
00:48:42.746 --> 00:48:45.602
He wanted to do a segment on HAARP

938
00:48:45.602 --> 00:48:50.458
and another segment on

939
00:48:50.458 --> 00:48:55.458
did we have prior knowledge of Japanese attack

940
00:48:55.784 --> 00:49:00.784
in Pearl Harbor in December of '41.

941
00:49:01.264 --> 00:49:05.699
The answer he got back from the network he was working with

942
00:49:05.699 --> 00:49:08.973
was they didn't wanna do prior knowledge in Pearl Harbor

943
00:49:08.973 --> 00:49:12.004
because it's too much like 9/11,

944
00:49:12.004 --> 00:49:16.148
and they don't wanna destabilize the public's opinion

945
00:49:16.148 --> 00:49:17.507
of the government.

946
00:49:17.507 --> 00:49:19.213
They didn't want the public to get the idea

947
00:49:19.213 --> 00:49:21.315
that maybe the government had something to do with 9/11

948
00:49:21.315 --> 00:49:23.718
if they had something to do with Pearl Harbor.

949
00:49:23.718 --> 00:49:25.216
He said, "Okay, I can understand that.

950
00:49:25.216 --> 00:49:26.690
"What about HAARP?"

951
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.490
"No comment."

952
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:29.488
"What do you mean no comment?"

953
00:49:29.488 --> 00:49:30.527
"Sorry, no comment.

954
00:49:30.527 --> 00:49:33.824
"We're not gonna talk about that."

955
00:49:33.824 --> 00:49:35.763
There's something going on out there.

956
00:49:35.763 --> 00:49:39.328
It's not just not being covered,

957
00:49:39.328 --> 00:49:42.636
it's not being covered.

958
00:49:42.636 --> 00:49:45.074
<v Regina>What is a person watching this segment to do</v>

959
00:49:45.074 --> 00:49:47.037
if they have now been alerted to the fact

960
00:49:47.037 --> 00:49:49.637
this project exists and they have some concerns?

961
00:49:49.637 --> 00:49:53.201
<v ->Well, they can do an internet search.</v>

962
00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:56.975
There are about five or six books on the subject.

963
00:49:56.975 --> 00:49:58.948
There are a lot of websites out there

964
00:49:58.948 --> 00:50:01.421
that have information on it.

965
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:05.520
There is the old write your congressman.

966
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Regina>Does your congressman</v>

967
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.993
even know about the project?

968
00:50:07.993 --> 00:50:10.164
<v ->I doubt it.</v>

969
00:50:10.164 --> 00:50:13.496
I'm sure he's gonna take what his aids tell him about it,

970
00:50:13.496 --> 00:50:14.286
and the aids are gonna say,

971
00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:16.665
"Hey, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

972
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:19.742
"They're just conspiracy nutcases."

973
00:50:19.742 --> 00:50:23.278
<v Regina>When you look at a project this large,</v>

974
00:50:23.278 --> 00:50:25.382
you would think this would take a very large

975
00:50:25.382 --> 00:50:28.145
amount of funding from our Congress,

976
00:50:28.145 --> 00:50:29.550
appropriations from the Congress.

977
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.477
Is that not how this is being funded?

978
00:50:31.477 --> 00:50:34.623
<v ->Actually, this is an amazingly cheap project.</v>

979
00:50:34.623 --> 00:50:39.557
To date, in the 11 years they've been funding the project,

980
00:50:39.557 --> 00:50:44.557
they still have yet to break the 300 million mark.

981
00:50:45.897 --> 00:50:47.534
This is one of those things where the DOD,

982
00:50:47.534 --> 00:50:48.706
the Department of Defense, is getting

983
00:50:48.706 --> 00:50:51.034
a lot of bang for its buck.

984
00:50:51.034 --> 00:50:56.034
If this thing works, it's gonna be a

985
00:50:56.967 --> 00:50:58.476
weapon system that'll be the

986
00:50:58.476 --> 00:51:01.251
cheapest damn thing in the arsenal.

987
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:06.220
That's another reason why it's actually delayed,

988
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:10.702
because when George W. Bush came in, they defunded it

989
00:51:10.702 --> 00:51:13.763
because there wasn't all that good kickback.

990
00:51:13.763 --> 00:51:16.433
There wasn't all that good pork in it.

991
00:51:16.433 --> 00:51:21.433
He put the defense budget on anti-missile missiles.

992
00:51:22.029 --> 00:51:24.166
This shoot a bullet with a bullet nonsense.

993
00:51:24.166 --> 00:51:25.942
The system can't work.

994
00:51:25.942 --> 00:51:29.971
They have done tests and all the tests have been fudged.

995
00:51:29.971 --> 00:51:33.805
They demonstrate, "We can shoot down a

996
00:51:33.805 --> 00:51:34.910
"missile with a missile,

997
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.348
"but we have to know when the missile is gonna launch,

998
00:51:37.348 --> 00:51:38.671
"and we have to know where it's going,

999
00:51:38.671 --> 00:51:40.250
"and it has to have a homing beacon on it."

1000
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:44.685
(laughing)

1001
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:46.993
The crazy thing is, is that the Department of Defense

1002
00:51:46.993 --> 00:51:51.335
now has its own missile base and it's 26 miles from HAARP.

1003
00:51:51.335 --> 00:51:54.168
Just down the road from HAARP is Fort Greeley,

1004
00:51:54.168 --> 00:51:57.175
and that's where all of the United States defensive

1005
00:51:57.175 --> 00:52:00.635
anti-missile missiles are being sent.

1006
00:52:00.635 --> 00:52:04.211
Makes you wonder what it is they're really trying to defend.

1007
00:52:04.211 --> 00:52:05.708
<v Regina>Okay, let's say it doesn't work to write</v>

1008
00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:08.680
to our Congressman, then what?

1009
00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.817
<v ->I wish I knew.</v>

1010
00:52:10.817 --> 00:52:15.817
Frankly, I've been studying this for almost eight,

1011
00:52:16.413 --> 00:52:19.222
ten years now, and I really don't have a clue.

1012
00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:21.393
I'm very, very hopeless on this,

1013
00:52:21.393 --> 00:52:25.062
because what I realized in writing the book

1014
00:52:25.062 --> 00:52:29.497
was that there are some very, very fundamental questions

1015
00:52:29.497 --> 00:52:31.796
that our society needs to ask.

1016
00:52:31.796 --> 00:52:33.398
One of these fundamental questions is,

1017
00:52:33.398 --> 00:52:37.578
is there a flaw in the way we fund and conduct science?

1018
00:52:37.578 --> 00:52:41.780
Right now, we are conducting science in the interest

1019
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.846
of the government and in the interest of

1020
00:52:44.846 --> 00:52:47.551
multinational corporations.

1021
00:52:47.551 --> 00:52:51.591
Maybe the science will produce something that's a benefit

1022
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:56.026
to our culture, and maybe not.

1023
00:52:56.026 --> 00:52:58.627
Another question I found myself asking is,

1024
00:52:58.627 --> 00:53:02.829
how does a democracy defend itself from its own milititary

1025
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:06.155
and covert agencies?

1026
00:53:06.155 --> 00:53:09.606
if HAARP is a covert project in some ways,

1027
00:53:09.606 --> 00:53:11.615
and it looks to me like it is a classic

1028
00:53:11.615 --> 00:53:16.615
compartmentalized operation,

1029
00:53:17.455 --> 00:53:21.019
each unit knows what it needs to do

1030
00:53:21.019 --> 00:53:22.853
to get its part of the job done,

1031
00:53:22.853 --> 00:53:25.558
and often doesn't know that there are any other units,

1032
00:53:25.558 --> 00:53:27.822
much less what they're doing.

1033
00:53:27.822 --> 00:53:31.468
The guys on the ground in Alaska are radio frequency

1034
00:53:31.468 --> 00:53:33.430
and ionospheric scientists

1035
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:38.430
and their doing radio frequency ionospheric science.

1036
00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:40.344
You talk to any of those guys and they are like,

1037
00:53:40.344 --> 00:53:44.280
"You're crazy if you think we're making a weapon here.

1038
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.682
"We're just finding out how the ionosphere works."

1039
00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:49.888
That may well be the truth,

1040
00:53:49.888 --> 00:53:52.256
but on the other hand, the HAARP side is designed

1041
00:53:52.256 --> 00:53:53.858
to be operated remotely.

1042
00:53:53.858 --> 00:53:56.842
It's designed so that you have the grunts on the ground

1043
00:53:56.842 --> 00:53:59.059
turning on the equipment and watching the dials,

1044
00:53:59.059 --> 00:54:02.066
and the scientist, who's actually conducting the experiment,

1045
00:54:02.066 --> 00:54:03.994
could be in Bolivia.

1046
00:54:03.994 --> 00:54:05.863
So, how do they know?

1047
00:54:05.863 --> 00:54:07.720
How do the guys on the ground know

1048
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.772
that they are not being misused by military scientists

1049
00:54:11.772 --> 00:54:14.373
coming from some military lab?

1050
00:54:14.373 --> 00:54:16.312
They don't.

1051
00:54:16.312 --> 00:54:17.368
<v Regina>And none of us</v>

1052
00:54:17.368 --> 00:54:19.551
as citizens know--
<v ->None of us do either.</v>

1053
00:54:19.551 --> 00:54:21.478
There's no way we can find out.

1054
00:54:21.478 --> 00:54:23.986
Some of the things about HAARP that I find suspicious

1055
00:54:23.986 --> 00:54:26.645
is that supposedly it's all civilian and above board

1056
00:54:26.645 --> 00:54:29.710
and you can learn anything you want,

1057
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:31.591
but they haven't updated their website

1058
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:34.331
in almost three years.

1059
00:54:34.331 --> 00:54:35.631
You can learn anything you wanna know

1060
00:54:35.631 --> 00:54:40.631
as long as you don't wanna know anything current.

1061
00:54:42.189 --> 00:54:45.609
<v Regina>On that note, I think we're going to</v>

1062
00:54:45.609 --> 00:54:47.502
have to leave it to some of the brilliant people

1063
00:54:47.502 --> 00:54:50.334
that are viewing this interview to see how far

1064
00:54:50.334 --> 00:54:52.912
we can take it to find out more.

1065
00:54:52.912 --> 00:54:57.312
<v ->Right, and one of the things that I'm concerned about</v>

1066
00:54:57.312 --> 00:55:01.050
with civilians trying to figure this thing out is that

1067
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:05.358
most of us never learn about the black budget,

1068
00:55:05.358 --> 00:55:08.481
about the black projects.

1069
00:55:08.481 --> 00:55:11.769
There are tens of thousands of research projects

1070
00:55:11.769 --> 00:55:13.395
being run right now.

1071
00:55:13.395 --> 00:55:16.332
We hear about HAARP and we go, oh, one size fits all.

1072
00:55:16.332 --> 00:55:21.231
There is this going on, and HAARP's responsilbe for it.

1073
00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:22.241
<v Regina>Back up just a sec.</v>

1074
00:55:22.241 --> 00:55:24.749
Most people don't know what the black budget is,

1075
00:55:24.749 --> 00:55:28.279
if you wanna just explain briefly what is the black budget.

1076
00:55:28.279 --> 00:55:29.451
That funds all of these

1077
00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:30.589
types of--
<v ->In theory,</v>

1078
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:32.423
Congress has the power of the purse.

1079
00:55:32.423 --> 00:55:37.423
In theory, Congress can tell the military,

1080
00:55:38.159 --> 00:55:39.459
"We want you to build this

1081
00:55:39.459 --> 00:55:42.315
"and we're gonna give you X amount of dollars to build it."

1082
00:55:42.315 --> 00:55:46.971
If the military says, "We don't wanna build that."

1083
00:55:46.971 --> 00:55:50.361
They just say, "Hey, we're your bosses, you build it."

1084
00:55:50.361 --> 00:55:52.033
This is what Ted Stevens says,

1085
00:55:52.033 --> 00:55:55.307
that he forced the military to build HAARP.

1086
00:55:55.307 --> 00:55:57.907
On the other hand, the military,

1087
00:55:57.907 --> 00:56:01.748
and particularly the covert agencies, they want stuff,

1088
00:56:01.748 --> 00:56:06.748
and they don't want to be restrained from having the stuff.

1089
00:56:08.249 --> 00:56:11.128
<v ->If the subject interests you, try doing an online search</v>

1090
00:56:11.128 --> 00:56:14.530
under HAARP, and that's spelled H-A-A-R-P.

1091
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.933
There are also several books on the subject out there,

1092
00:56:16.933 --> 00:56:18.396
and finally, you might want to check

1093
00:56:18.396 --> 00:56:22.239
with your local legislator as to an update on the project.

1094
00:56:22.239 --> 00:56:25.304
To look at the new technologies that extend from the various

1095
00:56:25.304 --> 00:56:27.603
applications of radio frequencies,

1096
00:56:27.603 --> 00:56:29.844
check out our interview with Dr. Begich.

1097
00:56:29.844 --> 00:56:32.909
Until next time, thanks for watching.
