00:00:00.927 --> 00:00:03.310
<v ->The collapse of the credit markets have left millions</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.315
of people frozen in their tracks,

3
00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:08.569
unable to pay their loans and credit card bills on one hand,

4
00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.507
and not able to obtain any new credit on the other.

5
00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:14.697
How did we become so ensnared in this debacle?

6
00:00:14.697 --> 00:00:16.968
And how can we find our way out when everything seems

7
00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:18.856
to be collapsing around us?

8
00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:22.605
James Martinez has an online radio show titled, Cash Flow,

9
00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.776
and he guides his listeners through the process

10
00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.531
of getting out from under debt,

11
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:30.800
but he says this process is not for the faint-hearted.

12
00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:35.035 line:15% 
(serene guitar music)

13
00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:41.780
This interview is somewhat of a surprise even for me

14
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.819
because we were going to talk just about the subject

15
00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:45.857
of credit, which is very important, too.

16
00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:47.696
Millions upon millions of people right now

17
00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:50.277
after the downturn in the economy.

18
00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:52.165
But what we're actually going to talk about as well,

19
00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:53.846
is money and mind control,

20
00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.862
and I don't think it's a stretch for anyone watching this

21
00:00:55.862 --> 00:00:57.953
to understand, these two go together.

22
00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:00.771
We have been narcotized, mesmerized, and hypnotized

23
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:05.000
into a state of chronic and almost unrelenting debt.

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.270
Certainly not just as a nation but in other countries

25
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.475
as well.

26
00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:10.243
Where do we even begin on this?

27
00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:11.689
Let's start.

28
00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:14.843
<v ->One of the things when I first started</v>

29
00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:16.571
is I wanted to explain,

30
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.453
not only the banking infrastructure and how it worked,

31
00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:23.410
but why people do the things they do

32
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.008
in relationship to their money.

33
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:27.994
And how we conditionally,

34
00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:30.190
after years and years of being told, and educated,

35
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.229
and social conditions,

36
00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.537
environments through television, media,

37
00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:35.814
paying your bills on time.

38
00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:37.787
All the habits that we grew up with,

39
00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:39.530
that our parents and the schools

40
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.204
were supposed to tell us about,

41
00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:43.307
a lot of that was left out,

42
00:01:43.307 --> 00:01:46.990
and mind control

43
00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:51.447
that's a big term that I'm sure the banks wouldn't like

44
00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:53.153
to be identified with.

45
00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:54.721
However,

46
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.481
when I see commercials

47
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:58.949
that foreshadow behavior

48
00:01:58.949 --> 00:02:01.435
and like prior to the Olympics,

49
00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:04.100
the Olympics' main sponsors were credit card companies.

50
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.522
Visa, it's everywhere you wanna be.

51
00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.957
It's everywhere you wanna be.

52
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:12.031
These slogans, a type of embedded commands--

53
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.188
<v ->Freedom.</v>

54
00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:14.308
<v ->Yeah, freedom.</v>

55
00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:16.502
Now the idea of that

56
00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.008
is not really true,

57
00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:21.988
as most of us are discovering now.

58
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:26.625
But the commercial campaign and education combined,

59
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.508
when credit card companies first started to come out,

60
00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:32.957
they wanted to extend your identity

61
00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:34.631
to the card itself,

62
00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:37.986
so that it became part of a cultural,

63
00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.418
fashionable identity.

64
00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:42.948
<v ->Like having a Platinum or a Gold.</v>

65
00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:46.172
<v ->Yeah, Platinum, Gold Card, all those things.</v>

66
00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:48.342
Pulling it out when you're on a date,

67
00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:50.294
and your Platinum Card,

68
00:02:50.294 --> 00:02:52.278
hello, do you know what I am, type of thing.

69
00:02:52.278 --> 00:02:55.691
All this imaginary type of scenarios creating

70
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:57.988
a relationship between self-esteem

71
00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:00.419
and illusionary money,

72
00:03:00.608 --> 00:03:03.224
has caused a massive, massive problem.

73
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.972
But mind control, I would say that's a term

74
00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:09.319
that I would completely put together

75
00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.425
with banking,

76
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:11.921
how it works today with credit card companies.

77
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.648
Watch any commercial today,

78
00:03:13.648 --> 00:03:15.044
it's designed to,

79
00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:16.572
especially if it's credit cards,

80
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:18.032
is to

81
00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.699
suggest something to your self-worth

82
00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.287
and your self-esteem.

83
00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.910
Visa, prior to the Olympics, came out with commercials where

84
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.608
they showed people in malls like robots,

85
00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:30.944
and they'd come out and they'd pay for their products,

86
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:35.091
and then somebody in the line would pull out cash.

87
00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.686
And then the commercial would freeze,

88
00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:39.430
wait two, three beats,

89
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.923
and then they would show the actor

90
00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:46.027
looking at the opposing person that paid with cash

91
00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:48.149
like there's something wrong with them.

92
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.125
<v ->Like, what are you doing?</v>

93
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.512
You're interrupting things right now by using cash.

94
00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:54.008
Like there's something wrong with them.

95
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:56.116
<v ->Are you a Neanderthal?
<v ->Are you a Neanderthal, yes.</v>

96
00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:59.289
All these, there's something the matter with you.

97
00:03:59.608 --> 00:04:02.752
All these campaigns suggesting that to people

98
00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:04.902
is a dangerous game because

99
00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:07.721
the two things that are most personal to people

100
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.230
are money and sex.

101
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.596
Money and the relationship somebody has with it,

102
00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:14.924
when they're going against the television,

103
00:04:14.924 --> 00:04:17.815
schools and all these things attacking them,

104
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:20.657
suggesting them a certain thing when it doesn't exist.

105
00:04:20.657 --> 00:04:23.488
I would say that's major mind control.

106
00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:24.959
Because

107
00:04:25.283 --> 00:04:27.896
I know that when I've taken somebody from a place

108
00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:31.315
of being in alleged credit card debt,

109
00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:32.825
that doesn't exist,

110
00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:35.903
and I have to take that person and reframe them,

111
00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:38.609
reframe their conscience so that they understand

112
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:40.636
they can go from an identity of

113
00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:42.500
I owe this alleged amount of money,

114
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.120
to a place where, wow, I don't actually owe them,

115
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.634
and I created the money out of thin air.

116
00:04:48.634 --> 00:04:50.821
And the merchants are paid off,

117
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:52.975
and this bill doesn't really exist

118
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:55.748
and why should I be working for the bank,

119
00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:57.593
everybody's been paid,

120
00:04:57.593 --> 00:05:00.196
that must mean that I'm like a battery pack

121
00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:02.009
or a laborer for the bank?

122
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.621
<v ->But where do you inject the consciousness</v>

123
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.254
of okay, I bought into it.

124
00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.365
I got drunk on the whole thing, too.

125
00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:08.784
I took the credit card out,

126
00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:10.799
I bought stuff I couldn't afford.

127
00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:13.896
How do you meld these levels of consciousness at this point,

128
00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.232
before you start working with someone?

129
00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.640
<v ->First of all, if they call me,</v>

130
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.272
first thing I know is that they're a complete media casualty

131
00:05:21.272 --> 00:05:22.447
to begin with.

132
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.832
That I'm dealing with somebody that

133
00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:26.816
most of the time they apologize to me,

134
00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:28.715
which is really weird.

135
00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:30.715
You don't need to apologize me because of something

136
00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:32.187
that I have nothing to do with,

137
00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:33.583
you're talking to me the first time.

138
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.876
And this is commonplace on the radio,

139
00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:37.446
in person,

140
00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:38.719
via email,

141
00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.517
they would apologize and confess their sins to me

142
00:05:40.517 --> 00:05:41.871
like they've done something wrong.

143
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:43.773
<v ->(sniveling) I bought things I shouldn't have bought.</v>

144
00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:45.729
<v ->Yes, and all this, issues.</v>

145
00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.855
and I'm like, that's not the issue at all.

146
00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:50.240
<v ->Never mind that they've had come-ons from the time</v>

147
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.545
they were probably 15 years old

148
00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:54.734
to take credit out, no less dogs,

149
00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:58.357
and even deceased people can get credit cards.

150
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.551
<v ->Got outta control</v>

151
00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:00.836
and

152
00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:03.048
now here I am and they're confessing to me

153
00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:04.275
all their problems,

154
00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:06.546
and now they want me to help them out of it,

155
00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:07.724
which I do.

156
00:06:07.724 --> 00:06:10.021
But one of the things and the most important thing

157
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:13.153
is making them understand from the inside out

158
00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:14.966
what happened to them,

159
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.357
how it's affected their whole behavior,

160
00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:18.669
their family, their relationships,

161
00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.259
their goals, their business.

162
00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:21.603
Everything, basically.

163
00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:22.865
Their entire life.

164
00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.314
So I have to take them from a position of years

165
00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:28.934
of conditioned responses

166
00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:29.931
of,

167
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.372
I owe.

168
00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.162
In a family union,

169
00:06:33.162 --> 00:06:35.627
coming home, realizing, oh that bill's 15,000,

170
00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:36.956
that's 20,000.

171
00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:38.965
And what that does, the shame that happens,

172
00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.586
'cause usually by the time they found me

173
00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:41.892
they've dealt with collectors

174
00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:44.769
and they feel like the biggest losers of all time.

175
00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:47.430
Granted, people on the opposing side say,

176
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.606
"Well, they coulda read the terms and agreement,

177
00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:52.131
they could've done this responsibly,"

178
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:53.499
or whatever.

179
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.073
That's true, but it's not true

180
00:06:56.073 --> 00:06:59.343
for people that are children,

181
00:06:59.343 --> 00:07:00.593
students,

182
00:07:00.593 --> 00:07:02.507
who are leaving high school

183
00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:05.601
going into a higher institute of learning,

184
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.699
and then when they go there

185
00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:09.611
they aren't told the facts about finance.

186
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:11.482
Even though they're in supposed to be a school,

187
00:07:11.482 --> 00:07:13.882
which to me is supposed to be a sacred place

188
00:07:13.882 --> 00:07:16.202
without the invasion of big corporate companies

189
00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.772
coming in a raping our students.

190
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.751
These people have worked very hard

191
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:22.115
just to get where they're at.

192
00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:24.139
In some cases, they come as freshmen

193
00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.206
and they're attacked by the banks.

194
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.968
<v ->When you say attack, go ahead and explain.</v>

195
00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:31.246
<v ->When I say attacked by the banks I say,</v>

196
00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:35.797
they show up on campus and get children,

197
00:07:36.007 --> 00:07:37.487
to me they're still children.

198
00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:38.754
<v ->Eh, 18 years old.</v>

199
00:07:38.754 --> 00:07:42.080
<v ->Yeah, that have their dreams set up</v>

200
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.231
for their life.

201
00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:45.014
I wanna be this, I wanna do this, I wanna go this.

202
00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:46.922
I should start getting credit now

203
00:07:46.922 --> 00:07:48.666
'cause I wanna get married and I wanna build my life.

204
00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:50.291
It's the platform for building your life.

205
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.026
<v ->You can't build a life without credit they tell you.</v>

206
00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.498
<v ->Yeah, you can't build a life, you can't do it.</v>

207
00:07:53.498 --> 00:07:54.890
It's been kinda true lately.

208
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.788
<v ->That's right.</v>

209
00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:58.700
So then what happens these students get into these positions

210
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.871
where they've got the campus Citibank,

211
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:02.701
or whatever bank is there that's coming,

212
00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:03.876
Capital One, whatever.

213
00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:04.962
They're all very public about it.

214
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.220
Come there, the get you into one,

215
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.087
sign up, it's only $500,

216
00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.611
but they got you.

217
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:12.258
And then they just say, well just keep paying your minimums.

218
00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:13.953
You become a revolving account person

219
00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:15.969
which means you're basically a slave,

220
00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:18.081
and now you're interacting--

221
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.986
<v ->Oh, but a AAA's credit ratings life.</v>

222
00:08:20.986 --> 00:08:23.478
<v ->That's right, you're good, employee.</v>

223
00:08:23.478 --> 00:08:25.943
And if you're a good employee we're gonna give you more.

224
00:08:25.943 --> 00:08:27.758
Which you're rewarded for paying on time

225
00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:29.293
and all these things.

226
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.662
While you're making more debt

227
00:08:31.662 --> 00:08:34.244
you're being rewarded by getting more to spend.

228
00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:38.501
Then you have your peers around you doing the same thing.

229
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.895
Then you have television telling you.

230
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.826
Then you have magazines telling you.

231
00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:45.496
<v ->That you have to have that $1,500 purse.</v>

232
00:08:45.496 --> 00:08:46.541
<v ->That's right.</v>

233
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:48.804
And that your credit

234
00:08:48.804 --> 00:08:50.914
is your digital identity

235
00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:54.042
that is now going to determine your future.

236
00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:56.756
So while we advertise on television

237
00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:59.353
these grand illusions of wealth and what not,

238
00:08:59.353 --> 00:09:00.996
none of it's really real.

239
00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:04.155
So I would say that is a type of mind control.

240
00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:05.689
It's not the truth,

241
00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:07.654
it is a gigantic fraud,

242
00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:10.635
and it's hurt people all over the world.

243
00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:13.531
I've dealt with people that've come to me

244
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.950
that are in a position of killing themselves.

245
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.576
They're ready to do it.

246
00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:20.913
They come to me as a last bout,

247
00:09:20.913 --> 00:09:22.491
and then when I'm at them

248
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:26.115
I have to do a reframe from the inside out on them,

249
00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:28.252
to get them to see that

250
00:09:28.252 --> 00:09:30.245
it's not there.

251
00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:33.878
Nobody's gonna be able to prove to you that they

252
00:09:33.878 --> 00:09:35.428
loaned you this money.

253
00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:37.441
Please go out and look in all the courts

254
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.065
in the United States,

255
00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:41.963
where a credit card company proved that they loaned

256
00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.054
money to you.

257
00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:44.251
Doesn't exist.

258
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:47.011
And then I explain to 'em what happened to them.

259
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:49.993
Then there's this sigh of relief

260
00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:53.211
but I'm fighting against years and years and years

261
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:54.462
of conditioning.

262
00:09:54.462 --> 00:09:57.004
So it comes off like I'm a total alien to them,

263
00:09:57.004 --> 00:09:59.831
telling them that all the debts that you have,

264
00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:01.440
they're not really there.

265
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.588
Then when you need to make the decision to understand that

266
00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.273
we're gonna turn this around and you're gonna start tellin'

267
00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.385
the bank what to do.

268
00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:10.256
You tell them what to do,

269
00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:13.681
you don't receive and take orders from them anymore.

270
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:15.764
So what I'm doing is I'm taking a person

271
00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:17.634
and doing a total 360 on them,

272
00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:20.301
and I explain to them, getting out of the debt,

273
00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:23.223
administratively, legally, is easy.

274
00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:25.339
'Cause I've done it millions of times for people

275
00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:27.185
all over the US and different countries,

276
00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:29.018
different environments.

277
00:10:30.242 --> 00:10:32.469
<v ->But they have to be ready to look at themselves</v>

278
00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:34.023
and their lives, and be ready.

279
00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:36.746
I mean it's not like you're just filling out paperwork them.

280
00:10:36.746 --> 00:10:38.867
<v ->No, that's not it at all because what I'm trying to do--</v>

281
00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:40.482
<v ->You're having to reframe their whole life</v>

282
00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:42.204
and perception of themselves.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

283
00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:43.549
We have to do a total reframe on them

284
00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:45.223
because I said it's easy to get out of it,

285
00:10:45.223 --> 00:10:46.726
it's what you do afterwards.

286
00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:49.856
It's like sitting down with somebody and saying,

287
00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:53.028
this is what we're gonna do but tomorrow when you wake up,

288
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.056
one of your feet is gonna be chopped off.

289
00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:56.677
That's a big adjustment.

290
00:10:56.677 --> 00:10:57.674
Major adjustment.

291
00:10:57.674 --> 00:11:00.108
That's the type of thing that I'm asking people to do.

292
00:11:00.108 --> 00:11:02.946
When I get on the radio I reinforce this idea

293
00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:06.524
that they need to rethink finance,

294
00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.603
their self-esteem, their value,

295
00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:09.617
their relationships.

296
00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:11.295
I've had people call me,

297
00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:14.750
been like, "Just don't tell my wife about this."

298
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.981
All these relationship issues with people

299
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:19.672
that are on the brink of divorce,

300
00:11:19.672 --> 00:11:22.567
it's tearing families to pieces.

301
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.731
Women deal with this issue completely,

302
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:27.509
totally differently than men.

303
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:29.083
<v ->And I want to hear about all of this.</v>

304
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:31.029
<v ->Totally differently than men.</v>

305
00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:35.022
<v ->This whole illusion that's been created around</v>

306
00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:37.274
having wealth that never existed to begin with

307
00:11:37.274 --> 00:11:40.536
and surrounding ourself with more stuff, more vacations,

308
00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:43.681
and pumping our own egos up on this.

309
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:46.019
This is the part that we have to break, right?

310
00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.948
<v ->Yeah, because we bought into it.</v>

311
00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:51.780
Now we've arrived at a place in history where

312
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.874
by force, you're gonna have to change,

313
00:11:54.874 --> 00:11:56.177
period.

314
00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:59.251
The things you been doing, that's over now.

315
00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.329
Over.

316
00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:03.176
Not over temporarily, till the commercial comes on,

317
00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:04.921
over forever.

318
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:07.068
And that's a good thing, actually there's great things

319
00:12:07.068 --> 00:12:08.838
that are gonna happen from all of this.

320
00:12:08.838 --> 00:12:10.158
<v ->I agree.
<v ->For a lot of people</v>

321
00:12:10.158 --> 00:12:12.171
that have been living that way

322
00:12:12.543 --> 00:12:16.012
it's tragedy, fear,

323
00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:18.777
violence, jealousy.

324
00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:22.126
I've had all these things people propel to me

325
00:12:22.126 --> 00:12:24.087
through the email or whatever.

326
00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:27.698
There's a lot of effects that are happening

327
00:12:27.698 --> 00:12:29.329
behaviorally to people

328
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:31.921
that the press won't even talk about.

329
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.676
No television station is going to come out

330
00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:37.083
and flat out say,

331
00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:38.110
you been lied to.

332
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.166
The whole thing's a lie.

333
00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.289
Da da da da da da.

334
00:12:40.289 --> 00:12:42.334
They're just not going to do it.

335
00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:44.246
I would always joke on the air that when CNN

336
00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:45.809
would cut to break after they been talking about

337
00:12:45.809 --> 00:12:47.457
financial responsibility or whatever,

338
00:12:47.457 --> 00:12:50.237
commercial will come up and it's for a credit card company.

339
00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:51.670
Like, what are you saying?

340
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.347
<v ->(laughs) Right, well they still seem to be advertising</v>

341
00:12:54.347 --> 00:12:56.574
but as far as I understand, right now,

342
00:12:56.574 --> 00:12:58.090
credit's pretty much drying up.

343
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.894
<v ->Yeah, what they're doing now</v>

344
00:12:59.894 --> 00:13:01.247
all the credit card companies,

345
00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.879
regardless of what you say because when you sign

346
00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.115
the credit card agreement,

347
00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:05.257
you didn't have any rights.

348
00:13:05.257 --> 00:13:07.544
We're gonna tell you how it is, period.

349
00:13:07.544 --> 00:13:11.214
So if you've had a $10,000 spending limit,

350
00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:13.949
there, we'll just cut it down to six or seven,

351
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:15.020
no questions asked.

352
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.988
I don't care what you've done, how good you've been,

353
00:13:16.988 --> 00:13:18.772
how well you've paid,

354
00:13:18.772 --> 00:13:21.327
there is no rewards for financial responsibility

355
00:13:21.327 --> 00:13:22.937
in the credit game.

356
00:13:22.937 --> 00:13:24.985
You don't get anything extra for that.

357
00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:27.183
They never have done that.

358
00:13:27.183 --> 00:13:28.791
It seems like you would,

359
00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:30.986
but the reward is you get more credit.

360
00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:32.497
But really they're like,

361
00:13:32.497 --> 00:13:34.372
would you like to stab yourself some more?

362
00:13:34.372 --> 00:13:35.986
You really wanna torture, come on, go ahead.

363
00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:38.244
So it's kinda like that, they wanna get you involved

364
00:13:38.244 --> 00:13:41.225
that way and the whole thing's a total lie.

365
00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:45.164
It's a vast identity crisis

366
00:13:45.164 --> 00:13:47.224
which the entire country,

367
00:13:47.224 --> 00:13:49.682
and the rest of the world is in the middle of.

368
00:13:49.682 --> 00:13:52.785
<v ->So let's say you take a male that comes in, a man.</v>

369
00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:56.719
Maybe 45 years old, has a kid in high school,

370
00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:59.055
another one that's getting ready to go to college.

371
00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.783
Maybe he already has about 35,000 in debt,

372
00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:03.221
not much savings.

373
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:05.469
<v ->Right, it's over for him.
<v ->It's over.</v>

374
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.585
<v ->Most people at 6,000, it's over.</v>

375
00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.929
<v ->So now what do you do?</v>

376
00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:10.807
<v ->If somebody comes to me at that particular place--</v>

377
00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:13.623
<v ->And what happens to him, what's a classic portfolio?</v>

378
00:14:13.623 --> 00:14:15.798
<v ->Classic is, I'm gonna lose my family,</v>

379
00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:18.123
I'm working three jobs,

380
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.671
and I wanna kill myself.

381
00:14:20.803 --> 00:14:22.554
'Cause I'm just existing, I'm not living.

382
00:14:22.554 --> 00:14:24.987
Most of the people that arrive in this particular situation,

383
00:14:24.987 --> 00:14:26.618
they're just existing now,

384
00:14:26.618 --> 00:14:29.645
so they're just working two or three jobs.

385
00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:31.120
They have their career,

386
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.783
then they work for Capital One,

387
00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:34.013
they work for Chase,

388
00:14:34.013 --> 00:14:35.542
and they work for American Express.

389
00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.742
They don't even know it.

390
00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:39.601
So, guy comes to me in that particular scenario,

391
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:43.184
I have to determine how much alleged debt that he has,

392
00:14:43.184 --> 00:14:46.331
then I have to suggest to him and teach him,

393
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:47.498
that

394
00:14:48.202 --> 00:14:50.492
if you're gonna do what I ask of you

395
00:14:50.492 --> 00:14:52.549
and go through these changes,

396
00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:54.106
you're gonna have to follow this procedure,

397
00:14:54.106 --> 00:14:56.006
and do this, and do this, administratively.

398
00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:58.054
But then you're gonna have to change your behavior

399
00:14:58.054 --> 00:15:00.886
and stop looking in the rear view mirror,

400
00:15:00.886 --> 00:15:03.714
and start looking forward and seeing what's happening

401
00:15:03.714 --> 00:15:06.391
and how you will change and modify your behavior

402
00:15:06.391 --> 00:15:10.383
to recreate your ideas about what wealth is.

403
00:15:10.383 --> 00:15:12.323
You, if you have no debts,

404
00:15:12.323 --> 00:15:14.158
live in a small apartment,

405
00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:15.502
bills are paid,

406
00:15:15.502 --> 00:15:16.676
and you have savings,

407
00:15:16.676 --> 00:15:18.265
that's wealth.

408
00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:19.956
That's wealth.

409
00:15:20.374 --> 00:15:23.076
Despite whatever class and how much that is.

410
00:15:23.076 --> 00:15:26.353
If you're doing that, which some people are,

411
00:15:26.353 --> 00:15:27.535
that's wealth.

412
00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:30.565
And from that your credibility,

413
00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:32.251
that's wealth,

414
00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:35.803
because you aren't going into contracts that you're set up

415
00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:36.902
to fail with.

416
00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.949
And the credit card agreement you're doomed to fail that,

417
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:40.133
in some fashion.

418
00:15:40.133 --> 00:15:42.427
Even if you've done everything perfectly

419
00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:45.999
you are running a gigantic risk of using a credit card

420
00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:48.699
just because of now, the social pressures,

421
00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:51.112
and identity theft,

422
00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:53.985
make it dangerous to use a credit card in most cases.

423
00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:55.451
Even though all the advertisements that,

424
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:57.100
"We got everything under control.

425
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.694
With all our security countermeasures and so forth."

426
00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:00.994
It's not really,

427
00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:05.200
because I broke on the radio that in London,

428
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.188
the head of Homeland Security came out and made a statement

429
00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:11.199
that 40 million accounts had been hacked into.

430
00:16:11.633 --> 00:16:14.063
Credit reports had been thrashed.

431
00:16:14.063 --> 00:16:16.266
Lot of these people were students,

432
00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.416
of course.

433
00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:21.150
And it was done through a hacking procedure,

434
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.140
mobile hacking procedure,

435
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.708
that I talked about on the air.

436
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:26.133
So what I do

437
00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:29.253
is I totally destroy

438
00:16:29.253 --> 00:16:33.217
their idea of their relationship between this credit card

439
00:16:33.217 --> 00:16:34.745
and me.

440
00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:37.547
I take this, and destroy it.

441
00:16:37.547 --> 00:16:38.991
And cut this part out.

442
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:42.584
And then I reframe the person's idea of what wealth is

443
00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:45.757
and financial responsibility is, and so forth.

444
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.249
<v ->I assume you're on a cash and carry basis after that.</v>

445
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:50.590
<v ->Yeah, yeah.
<v ->You'll help 'em out</v>

446
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.338
but they better understand they're cash and carry.

447
00:16:52.338 --> 00:16:53.972
<v ->I don't wanna hear from 'em again, either.</v>

448
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.121
I tell 'em you do this once and you get it together,

449
00:16:56.121 --> 00:16:58.096
'cause I've never taken on a client twice.

450
00:16:58.096 --> 00:17:00.493
But I've have everybody come in for me,

451
00:17:00.493 --> 00:17:02.019
and it's all relative.

452
00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:05.245
Some students come in with like 8,000 and think it's,

453
00:17:05.245 --> 00:17:06.566
they're gonna kill themselves.

454
00:17:06.566 --> 00:17:07.675
And I've had that.

455
00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:10.085
And I had people come in with over half million.

456
00:17:10.085 --> 00:17:12.975
All different walks of life, lawyers, students,

457
00:17:12.975 --> 00:17:14.458
doctors,

458
00:17:15.055 --> 00:17:16.912
every class,

459
00:17:16.986 --> 00:17:18.475
foreigners,

460
00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:20.087
all come to me.

461
00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:23.368
Married couples deal with it completely different way.

462
00:17:23.368 --> 00:17:26.300
I have to do an intervention most of the time

463
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.972
with married couples
(laughing)

464
00:17:27.972 --> 00:17:29.495
because they're ready to kill themselves

465
00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:30.704
'cause they're blaming each other.

466
00:17:30.704 --> 00:17:31.758
<v ->Or kill each other.</v>

467
00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:33.275
<v ->Or kill each other.
<v ->Let's talk about the female</v>

468
00:17:33.275 --> 00:17:34.286
part of that.

469
00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.933
Now we talked about a typical scenario with a man,

470
00:17:35.933 --> 00:17:37.525
what's a typical scenario with a woman

471
00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:38.643
that would come to you,

472
00:17:38.643 --> 00:17:40.934
and how does she respond, what's this mean to her identity?

473
00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:42.704
<v ->She's totally embarrassed that she's gonna</v>

474
00:17:42.704 --> 00:17:43.974
have to talk to me,

475
00:17:43.974 --> 00:17:45.572
completely petrified,

476
00:17:45.572 --> 00:17:47.231
doesn't believe anything,

477
00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:49.692
and is afraid that she's going to be homeless.

478
00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:51.167
That's who they are.

479
00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:52.423
<v ->The security button.</v>

480
00:17:52.423 --> 00:17:53.276
<v ->That's it.</v>

481
00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:56.250
Because they have to deal with a different identity crisis

482
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.924
of being an independent woman,

483
00:17:57.924 --> 00:17:59.364
making their own money,

484
00:17:59.364 --> 00:18:00.516
their sense of value,

485
00:18:00.516 --> 00:18:01.657
survival,

486
00:18:01.657 --> 00:18:02.873
class,

487
00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:03.972
self-esteem.

488
00:18:03.972 --> 00:18:05.219
All of that comes into play

489
00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:06.663
so by the time they come to me,

490
00:18:06.663 --> 00:18:10.216
I have to work even harder to make them understand

491
00:18:10.216 --> 00:18:11.814
what has happened to them,

492
00:18:11.814 --> 00:18:13.119
what they need to do,

493
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:14.399
where they need to go.

494
00:18:14.399 --> 00:18:15.436
<v ->More fear.</v>

495
00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:17.655
I assume there's more fear.
<v ->Oh, complete, total fear.</v>

496
00:18:17.655 --> 00:18:19.256
<v ->As a woman I understand that</v>

497
00:18:19.256 --> 00:18:21.964
because I was probably in my 30s

498
00:18:21.964 --> 00:18:24.908
before I was even allowed to have credit.

499
00:18:24.908 --> 00:18:26.924
<v ->Right, yes.
<v ->Right?</v>

500
00:18:26.924 --> 00:18:29.244
I've been paying the bills but I wasn't even allowed to.

501
00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:30.873
<v ->It's a very serious issue for woman.</v>

502
00:18:30.873 --> 00:18:32.700
<v ->Very serious, and we're good girls.</v>

503
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.507
We pay our bills on time.

504
00:18:34.507 --> 00:18:36.481
<v ->And we don't wanna rely on a guy,</v>

505
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:38.271
we're tough, we got all our stuff together.

506
00:18:38.271 --> 00:18:40.052
<v ->Well you have to just in case, right?</v>

507
00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.303
<v ->That's right.
(laughing)

508
00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:43.138
<v ->So there is a lot of fear around survival,</v>

509
00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:45.694
what happens, there's no net.

510
00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:50.500
<v ->I show them that their thinking strategies are wrong.</v>

511
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.569
That they didn't get all the information,

512
00:18:52.569 --> 00:18:54.849
and not to believe me.

513
00:18:54.849 --> 00:18:57.206
Go and look here, here, here, here, here,

514
00:18:57.206 --> 00:18:59.663
and then come back and then determine

515
00:18:59.663 --> 00:19:01.291
whether I'm saying is correct.

516
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:03.412
Then it's up to them at that point if they wanna go with

517
00:19:03.412 --> 00:19:06.044
the procedure administratively, to get rid of it.

518
00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:07.269
Then it's up to them.

519
00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:10.556
And I don't really talk to people more than once or twice,

520
00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:14.836
'cause I find I'm interested in their resonance

521
00:19:14.836 --> 00:19:18.729
in relation to this idea of what the debt is.

522
00:19:18.729 --> 00:19:21.670
So I have to take these two things and dissolve them

523
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.264
into something completely different

524
00:19:23.264 --> 00:19:26.269
so that they can understand where they're headed toward.

525
00:19:26.269 --> 00:19:29.387
'Cause lot of 'em don't understand,

526
00:19:29.387 --> 00:19:32.299
so I'll say listen, listen to me on the radio,

527
00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:34.520
and make that be your mantra

528
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.141
and introduce this new behavior strategy over and over

529
00:19:38.141 --> 00:19:39.488
and over again.

530
00:19:39.488 --> 00:19:42.506
'Cause you've had like 20 years of lies

531
00:19:42.506 --> 00:19:45.731
and stuff that's not gonna be working anymore.

532
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.504
It's all over the radio, all over LA, everybody's angry,

533
00:19:50.504 --> 00:19:52.516
everybody's yellin' at each other,

534
00:19:52.516 --> 00:19:55.864
it's caused this major uproar in the south.

535
00:19:55.864 --> 00:19:59.615
All different types of people responding to this crisis

536
00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.316
in a different way.

537
00:20:02.194 --> 00:20:06.727
Behind the scenes, there's a lot of potential ideas of war

538
00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:10.086
happening that,

539
00:20:10.086 --> 00:20:11.211
I was on--

540
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.610
<v ->You mean domestically?</v>

541
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.207
<v ->Domestically, yes.</v>

542
00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:18.084
When I originally started on the radio I was reluctant

543
00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:19.770
to do that and come out with all this stuff

544
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.650
'cause I thought, I may be a target.

545
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.477
And then I thought, no.

546
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.107
Sometimes you just gotta step up to the plate,

547
00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:30.419
and I knew enough about it,

548
00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:32.541
and I could explain it in a different way

549
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:34.307
that would relieve somebody.

550
00:20:34.307 --> 00:20:38.572
That they could forgive themselves and move forward,

551
00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:43.377
and do so, and I would say that it was responsible.

552
00:20:44.749 --> 00:20:46.979
I didn't really wanna talk about it on the radio,

553
00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.160
and then when I did,

554
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.727
I started to hear and understand

555
00:20:51.727 --> 00:20:54.447
how far and wide this goes.

556
00:20:54.447 --> 00:20:58.803
As soon as there was ideas of violence and whatnot,

557
00:20:58.803 --> 00:21:01.025
I had to say on the air that,

558
00:21:01.025 --> 00:21:04.506
this may be everybody's problem, and everybody set this up,

559
00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:06.245
whoever is to blame,

560
00:21:06.245 --> 00:21:07.954
but the great thing about this is

561
00:21:07.954 --> 00:21:11.319
it's gonna bring everybody together in a different way.

562
00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.743
<v ->Mm-hmm, absolutely.</v>

563
00:21:12.743 --> 00:21:14.667
<v ->Now people know something's wrong</v>

564
00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:17.076
they don't know precisely what's wrong and it's opening

565
00:21:17.076 --> 00:21:18.484
the doors of discussion,

566
00:21:18.484 --> 00:21:20.663
neighbors are starting to speak to each other,

567
00:21:20.663 --> 00:21:22.445
their problems are now your problems.

568
00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:23.479
Oh, you got this, too?

569
00:21:23.479 --> 00:21:25.271
What did they do to you?

570
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.417
I used to have conference calls with 40 people

571
00:21:27.417 --> 00:21:28.577
on the telephone,

572
00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:31.382
and I would talk to 'em all about why

573
00:21:31.382 --> 00:21:33.067
this isn't your own problem,

574
00:21:33.067 --> 00:21:34.592
and stop beating yourself.

575
00:21:34.592 --> 00:21:37.333
'Cause I said, how many people on this conference call

576
00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:38.613
got this letter?

577
00:21:38.613 --> 00:21:39.697
And I would read it,

578
00:21:39.697 --> 00:21:42.410
and 15, 20 of them all got the same letter.

579
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.252
And I explained to them how

580
00:21:44.252 --> 00:21:47.218
the handling

581
00:21:47.218 --> 00:21:50.683
of your idea of your debt is managed

582
00:21:50.683 --> 00:21:53.068
through the written word,

583
00:21:53.068 --> 00:21:54.096
with language.

584
00:21:54.096 --> 00:21:56.604
How they would use, you, all the time,

585
00:21:56.604 --> 00:21:57.927
in the bills that we get,

586
00:21:57.927 --> 00:21:59.164
if you start collection.

587
00:21:59.164 --> 00:22:01.628
You owe this amount, and we want you to call us,

588
00:22:01.628 --> 00:22:04.930
and it's your responsibility, you you you, like 20 times.

589
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.160
I explain how they do the whole thing.

590
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.933
How they modify your behavior to think a certain way.

591
00:22:12.171 --> 00:22:13.124
<v ->To be unfair.</v>

592
00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:14.905
<v ->Yes, and to be enslaved.</v>

593
00:22:14.905 --> 00:22:16.378
<v ->Enslaved, yeah.</v>

594
00:22:16.676 --> 00:22:20.352
<v ->I would uproot all of that, destroy their ideas about it,</v>

595
00:22:20.352 --> 00:22:21.984
reframe into something else,

596
00:22:21.984 --> 00:22:24.159
and then liberate their consciousness.

597
00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:27.306
That was my main goal is to bridge minds,

598
00:22:27.306 --> 00:22:28.789
bring everybody together,

599
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:30.749
liberate consciousness and realize

600
00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:34.107
this issue with the credit industry,

601
00:22:34.398 --> 00:22:36.438
there's a much bigger thing going on here.

602
00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:39.276
And it's actually a time of celebration

603
00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:41.435
'cause we're going through a big paradigm shift,

604
00:22:41.435 --> 00:22:43.110
it's gonna be little bit painful

605
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.994
but there's gonna be a lot of things to look forward to

606
00:22:45.994 --> 00:22:49.035
as we enter into the digital environment where

607
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:52.544
now the introductions of new technologies are gonna destroy

608
00:22:52.544 --> 00:22:54.091
our idea of money,

609
00:22:54.091 --> 00:22:56.266
social class, wealth,

610
00:22:56.266 --> 00:22:57.370
forever.

611
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.862
<v ->Let's talk about that.</v>

612
00:22:58.862 --> 00:23:00.617
I was just going to ask you one thing

613
00:23:00.617 --> 00:23:02.974
because I think this is something that when I heard it

614
00:23:02.974 --> 00:23:06.366
it made an impression, and that was that,

615
00:23:06.366 --> 00:23:08.579
when you take out a credit card it's similar to a loan

616
00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:10.403
where that money is loaned out again and again.

617
00:23:10.403 --> 00:23:12.987
They've actually been repaid.

618
00:23:12.987 --> 00:23:14.406
<v ->Yes, they recycle them.</v>

619
00:23:14.406 --> 00:23:17.085
<v ->Very early on in the game.</v>

620
00:23:17.085 --> 00:23:19.345
So it's more than a hundred percent profit for them,

621
00:23:19.345 --> 00:23:21.115
you taking out a credit card.

622
00:23:21.115 --> 00:23:22.060
Yeah.
<v ->Yes.</v>

623
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.024
Because if they're not offering you anything.

624
00:23:25.024 --> 00:23:26.455
<v ->Right, right.</v>

625
00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:28.576
<v ->And then you pay them money from your labor.</v>

626
00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:29.419
<v ->Right.</v>

627
00:23:29.419 --> 00:23:30.595
<v ->Does that sound fair?</v>

628
00:23:30.595 --> 00:23:31.295
No.

629
00:23:31.295 --> 00:23:33.018
So you got this whole problem.

630
00:23:33.018 --> 00:23:35.555
<v ->It's not as though there's a great deal of suffering</v>

631
00:23:35.555 --> 00:23:37.454
electronically on the other end as it's all

632
00:23:37.454 --> 00:23:39.217
electronic anyway.

633
00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:40.980
(laughing)
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

634
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.227
<v ->Let's talk about the big picture.</v>

635
00:23:42.227 --> 00:23:43.816
Let's talk about what's coming,

636
00:23:43.816 --> 00:23:45.137
the fact that trillions,

637
00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:48.549
you told me off camera trillions of dollars have evaporated

638
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:52.229
through security hacks in the banking system.

639
00:23:52.229 --> 00:23:54.608
<v ->It seems to be okay today</v>

640
00:23:54.608 --> 00:23:57.753
that whatever government it is,

641
00:23:57.753 --> 00:23:59.349
not necessarily the US.

642
00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:00.705
Wherever.

643
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.412
Financial responsibility

644
00:24:03.412 --> 00:24:05.852
and when money just

645
00:24:05.852 --> 00:24:07.077
evaporates

646
00:24:07.077 --> 00:24:10.446
and our leaders come out and say we don't know where it is.

647
00:24:11.111 --> 00:24:14.868
The responsibility level of that and how we relate to it,

648
00:24:14.868 --> 00:24:16.785
I don't think people understand

649
00:24:16.785 --> 00:24:19.713
what is going on behind the seams

650
00:24:19.713 --> 00:24:23.267
in terms of our information overload that we're in.

651
00:24:23.267 --> 00:24:25.040
And what that's done to banking.

652
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.766
'Cause when the computer came out

653
00:24:28.766 --> 00:24:31.421
most of us used to pay our bills by sending

654
00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:32.947
checks in the mail.

655
00:24:32.947 --> 00:24:35.776
And when people started

656
00:24:35.776 --> 00:24:40.452
to get computers and started paying bills online

657
00:24:40.724 --> 00:24:42.794
and getting credit card offers online

658
00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:46.089
and we starting interacting with the machines.

659
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.923
Millions and millions of these credit card issuers

660
00:24:49.923 --> 00:24:51.512
were coming out,

661
00:24:51.707 --> 00:24:53.531
30 second approval,

662
00:24:53.531 --> 00:24:56.276
massive amounts of data were going back and forth,

663
00:24:56.276 --> 00:24:59.165
people were charging things the money they didn't have.

664
00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:01.325
We've got exchanges of information

665
00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:03.276
and people stealing information,

666
00:25:03.276 --> 00:25:05.729
in terms of ones and zeros and amounts,

667
00:25:05.729 --> 00:25:08.652
through SWIFT codes, which are the banking codes

668
00:25:08.652 --> 00:25:10.102
of how people transfer money.

669
00:25:10.102 --> 00:25:13.234
Now if I'm a scumbag running a big country

670
00:25:13.234 --> 00:25:15.442
and I have access to billions,

671
00:25:15.442 --> 00:25:18.927
and I'm competing with other countries

672
00:25:19.303 --> 00:25:20.762
in other markets

673
00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:22.853
where I'm transferring funds back and forth

674
00:25:22.853 --> 00:25:24.453
in the billions,

675
00:25:24.453 --> 00:25:26.287
and I have the technology to understand

676
00:25:26.287 --> 00:25:29.522
that technology dictates modality.

677
00:25:29.522 --> 00:25:32.510
I can go in and essentially steal money,

678
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.769
and take it, hide it,

679
00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:38.643
and transfer it and create places where I can

680
00:25:38.643 --> 00:25:41.363
create interest on the slush funds.

681
00:25:41.363 --> 00:25:43.143
<v ->And this is going on regularly?</v>

682
00:25:43.143 --> 00:25:45.596
<v ->Yeah, and it's been reported very quietly</v>

683
00:25:45.596 --> 00:25:47.544
on some websites.

684
00:25:47.544 --> 00:25:49.469
I don't name names with it,

685
00:25:49.469 --> 00:25:51.829
I just suggest it as a possibility,

686
00:25:51.829 --> 00:25:53.561
and most of the time when I've explained

687
00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:55.527
what the electrical environment can do,

688
00:25:55.527 --> 00:25:57.736
they take that and go wow,

689
00:25:57.736 --> 00:25:59.236
maybe that can happen

690
00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:00.878
and that's what's really going on behind the scenes,

691
00:26:00.878 --> 00:26:04.537
is the hijacking of funds all over the world,

692
00:26:04.537 --> 00:26:07.692
and the inability to control that.

693
00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:13.099
I reinforced that point couple days ago

694
00:26:13.099 --> 00:26:14.557
when I was on the air and I talked about

695
00:26:14.557 --> 00:26:16.423
the World Bank got hacked into.

696
00:26:16.423 --> 00:26:18.526
The World Bank.

697
00:26:18.761 --> 00:26:21.283
A major bank with the IMF up there

698
00:26:21.283 --> 00:26:24.227
that handles billions had been hacked into,

699
00:26:24.227 --> 00:26:27.113
and had been hacked into, for a long time

700
00:26:27.113 --> 00:26:28.617
by a foreign country,

701
00:26:28.617 --> 00:26:30.180
and it coulda been counterintelligence,

702
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.684
it coulda been real information.

703
00:26:31.684 --> 00:26:33.039
But that's not the point.

704
00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:34.606
The point is

705
00:26:34.606 --> 00:26:37.422
that subject matter is out there,

706
00:26:37.422 --> 00:26:39.705
and I've experienced myself

707
00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:41.492
funds being taken out from nowhere.

708
00:26:41.492 --> 00:26:43.030
I never found out who did it.

709
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.234
<v ->You've experienced identity theft.</v>

710
00:26:45.234 --> 00:26:46.778
<v ->I've had experienced identity theft.</v>

711
00:26:46.778 --> 00:26:49.172
<v ->Front monies have evaporated from your account.</v>

712
00:26:49.172 --> 00:26:52.669
<v ->Money in my savings, gone in increments of 30.</v>

713
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:56.830
30 amounts, $30, repeatedly, in cycles.

714
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.270
All of a sudden a program comes in,

715
00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.539
fssht, takes it.

716
00:26:59.539 --> 00:27:02.214
Big investigations going on about

717
00:27:02.214 --> 00:27:04.024
where it's from, who's doing it.

718
00:27:04.024 --> 00:27:07.681
Then I talked to the Cyber Crime Division with the FBI,

719
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:10.392
and they can't handle nor with they answer

720
00:27:10.392 --> 00:27:12.302
how prevalent this is.

721
00:27:12.302 --> 00:27:14.125
Nobody's talking about that.

722
00:27:14.125 --> 00:27:17.606
That is the biggest thing that nobody is talking about,

723
00:27:17.606 --> 00:27:20.266
is what the electrical environment does to banking

724
00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:21.529
and the future of it.

725
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:24.427
'Cause now we have this virtual economy going,

726
00:27:24.427 --> 00:27:26.459
people are responding,

727
00:27:27.348 --> 00:27:29.536
when they see the media we see this fluctuation

728
00:27:29.536 --> 00:27:30.971
going up and down,

729
00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:34.116
like respond to emotionally what's happening to the market.

730
00:27:34.116 --> 00:27:37.271
While we're being told that the credit markets

731
00:27:37.271 --> 00:27:38.348
are saturated.

732
00:27:38.348 --> 00:27:40.822
And the real information now is us communicating

733
00:27:40.822 --> 00:27:43.222
back and forth, typing, information flow,

734
00:27:43.222 --> 00:27:45.437
boom boom boom boom, all the time.

735
00:27:45.754 --> 00:27:48.130
What I did specifically for today

736
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.816
is, I knew that you were coming,

737
00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:53.378
I spoke specifically about that,

738
00:27:53.378 --> 00:27:55.062
because it's the one thing that I talk about

739
00:27:55.062 --> 00:27:56.566
that nobody else in the financial world

740
00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:58.380
will talk about at all.

741
00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.994
The position that we're in today,

742
00:28:01.994 --> 00:28:04.050
I commented on the radio so people can go listen

743
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.831
to the archives of the date, of this broadcast,

744
00:28:05.831 --> 00:28:07.581
of this interview right now,

745
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:10.158
and they can get further information from an expert,

746
00:28:10.158 --> 00:28:13.717
who's a mediacologist and has talked about

747
00:28:13.956 --> 00:28:16.112
the introduction of a new technology,

748
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:17.434
which is cold fusion.

749
00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:19.056
Which has been held back from the public

750
00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:20.602
for so long.
<v ->Yes, it has.</v>

751
00:28:20.602 --> 00:28:23.070
<v ->For so long, and then we've heard for years</v>

752
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.862
about Pons and Fleischman and cold fusion,

753
00:28:24.862 --> 00:28:26.931
and misinformation, it doesn't work, it does work,

754
00:28:26.931 --> 00:28:28.232
it doesn't work.

755
00:28:28.232 --> 00:28:30.647
The powers to be understand that if you're to bring

756
00:28:30.647 --> 00:28:33.228
something like that into the market,

757
00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:37.940
that the economy and value and money

758
00:28:38.529 --> 00:28:41.258
is gonna be over, it's gonna be something different.

759
00:28:41.258 --> 00:28:42.756
<v ->Make the link for me.</v>

760
00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:47.038
<v ->Well, if you bring in this device</v>

761
00:28:47.038 --> 00:28:49.392
it's gonna make the person that invented it

762
00:28:49.392 --> 00:28:50.949
a quadrillionaire overnight.

763
00:28:50.949 --> 00:28:52.863
'Cause you buy it once and you have power for the rest

764
00:28:52.863 --> 00:28:54.127
of your life.

765
00:28:54.127 --> 00:28:56.843
So, the person becomes a quadrillionaire,

766
00:28:56.843 --> 00:28:59.473
but then nobody buys the product again.

767
00:28:59.626 --> 00:29:02.098
So the quadrillionaire now

768
00:29:02.098 --> 00:29:05.230
has all this so-called money from buying it,

769
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.403
but it doesn't have any value in the new environment

770
00:29:08.403 --> 00:29:09.885
which it brings.

771
00:29:09.885 --> 00:29:12.939
So we've had some people behind the scenes,

772
00:29:12.939 --> 00:29:15.787
that have been known what the computer has done to banking,

773
00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:18.433
and realized with all the other problems of the world,

774
00:29:18.433 --> 00:29:20.097
in fossil fuels,

775
00:29:20.097 --> 00:29:21.898
and pollution,

776
00:29:21.898 --> 00:29:25.592
and this fractionalized banking, fiat money system,

777
00:29:25.592 --> 00:29:27.982
doesn't work in the digital environment.

778
00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:29.420
<v ->That seems obvious right now.</v>

779
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.251
<v ->Yeah, that we're gonna have to go to a new place,</v>

780
00:29:32.251 --> 00:29:34.273
for all of us, the whole world,

781
00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:37.660
money and exchange of value

782
00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.224
is gonna be a different thing in the future.

783
00:29:40.224 --> 00:29:42.239
So you have powers that be behind the scenes

784
00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:45.744
that decided that since after the Olympics,

785
00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:47.814
China,

786
00:29:47.814 --> 00:29:51.169
essentially the computers or technology,

787
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:52.842
declared war on that country.

788
00:29:52.842 --> 00:29:54.837
By all these other artificial environments

789
00:29:54.837 --> 00:29:57.915
they've held off internet content of it,

790
00:29:58.285 --> 00:30:00.146
the modernization of that country.

791
00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:02.567
The computers come in and without anybody doing it,

792
00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:04.775
just humans interacting with technology,

793
00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:08.023
will destroy communism in a sense.

794
00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:11.488
We have a whole different place for the entire world,

795
00:30:11.488 --> 00:30:12.992
we never been here before.

796
00:30:12.992 --> 00:30:16.117
So we're going to a new place where new technologies

797
00:30:16.117 --> 00:30:18.753
are gonna have to be implemented,

798
00:30:19.053 --> 00:30:20.987
and when it does.

799
00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:22.289
Mcloone talked about that,

800
00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:24.630
anytime a new technology's introduced

801
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.113
and we start interacting in it,

802
00:30:26.113 --> 00:30:28.001
there's all these effects that happen from it,

803
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:29.701
one of which is war.

804
00:30:29.701 --> 00:30:30.884
There's gonna be a lot of violence,

805
00:30:30.884 --> 00:30:33.218
of who's gonna control this?

806
00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:35.633
What are the effects on the family?

807
00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.564
Work, what will I do for work?

808
00:30:37.564 --> 00:30:39.127
You're gonna have all this extra time.

809
00:30:39.127 --> 00:30:40.496
The gas company is gone,

810
00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:41.892
the car companies are gone,

811
00:30:41.892 --> 00:30:43.671
or they're gonna be different.

812
00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:45.285
It will change everything.

813
00:30:45.285 --> 00:30:47.494
Our schooling will change,

814
00:30:47.494 --> 00:30:50.578
all the ideas about physics and all those things,

815
00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:51.900
and energy,

816
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.715
gone.

817
00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:53.496
<v ->Gone.</v>

818
00:30:53.496 --> 00:30:54.771
<v ->All the people that had jobs</v>

819
00:30:54.771 --> 00:30:57.552
and trained for years in school, got their education,

820
00:30:57.552 --> 00:30:59.302
this device comes in,

821
00:30:59.302 --> 00:31:01.453
we don't need them anymore.

822
00:31:01.453 --> 00:31:02.389
<v ->True.</v>

823
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:04.272
<v ->That's how the whole thing that's going to happen.</v>

824
00:31:04.272 --> 00:31:06.053
When the next five years or so,

825
00:31:06.053 --> 00:31:07.975
it's already started, I was given the data,

826
00:31:07.975 --> 00:31:11.013
it was 8/28/08

827
00:31:11.013 --> 00:31:13.632
is when the official

828
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.957
idea

829
00:31:16.594 --> 00:31:19.334
of cold fusion was initiated

830
00:31:19.862 --> 00:31:21.266
and given to the public.

831
00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:24.076
I said it on the air from one of the people that I talk to

832
00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:25.621
who's a mediacologist

833
00:31:25.621 --> 00:31:27.483
about why that was the date,

834
00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:29.512
and he went into, "I don't quite understand that."

835
00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:34.168
I talk about it but I'm more talking about cold fusion

836
00:31:34.715 --> 00:31:36.782
so people understand that

837
00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:39.135
the credit card, and money, and energy,

838
00:31:39.135 --> 00:31:41.470
and how we do information back and forth,

839
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.686
it's all gonna change.

840
00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:44.979
And there's massive identity crisis right now

841
00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:47.395
of where we're going and how we're gonna survive.

842
00:31:47.395 --> 00:31:50.242
I've had these credit cards and I've been surviving off them

843
00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:52.098
and my business survives.

844
00:31:52.098 --> 00:31:53.642
<v ->We need to let that go.</v>

845
00:31:53.642 --> 00:31:54.541
<v ->Yeah, it's over.</v>

846
00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:56.065
<v ->We need to let the whole notion of,</v>

847
00:31:56.065 --> 00:31:58.341
gee, but what if my credit score goes down?

848
00:31:58.341 --> 00:31:59.480
What difference does it make?

849
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.398
I suppose on one level if you're never going to be issued

850
00:32:01.398 --> 00:32:02.502
credit again. (laughs)

851
00:32:02.502 --> 00:32:04.404
<v ->Right, and do you want it?</v>

852
00:32:04.404 --> 00:32:05.944
Do you really wanna go through that again?

853
00:32:05.944 --> 00:32:06.757
<v ->Exactly.</v>

854
00:32:06.757 --> 00:32:09.206
<v ->So I have to deal with all those type of things.</v>

855
00:32:09.737 --> 00:32:11.718
There's a lot of people that talk about finance

856
00:32:11.718 --> 00:32:13.674
on big TV,

857
00:32:14.453 --> 00:32:15.805
but they're not telling you the entire truth

858
00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:17.800
because they're working for the banks.

859
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.667
Experts on CNN and whatnot talk about

860
00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:21.048
credit card responsibility,

861
00:32:21.048 --> 00:32:23.138
I could name names and all who they are,

862
00:32:23.138 --> 00:32:24.195
what they're doing.

863
00:32:24.195 --> 00:32:25.922
Even the most responsible one on radio

864
00:32:25.922 --> 00:32:27.892
that has a show about credit cards

865
00:32:27.892 --> 00:32:30.130
works for the bank.

866
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.505
That came out in a bunch of documentaries

867
00:32:33.505 --> 00:32:35.672
that came out about the credit card industry,

868
00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:36.696
and who's really doing what

869
00:32:36.696 --> 00:32:37.870
and who's really telling the truth.

870
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.959
I don't work for the banks.

871
00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:41.612
I don't like what they've done.

872
00:32:41.612 --> 00:32:45.346
I don't like how they've manipulated everybody.

873
00:32:45.346 --> 00:32:46.712
I don't like being a slave,

874
00:32:46.712 --> 00:32:47.788
I like freedom.

875
00:32:47.788 --> 00:32:49.271
I like freedom of consciousness,

876
00:32:49.271 --> 00:32:50.488
freedom of choice.

877
00:32:50.488 --> 00:32:53.815
And I like to be able to assist

878
00:32:53.815 --> 00:32:57.024
in liberating somebody's consciousness and soul

879
00:32:57.024 --> 00:32:59.437
so they can go from this despair

880
00:32:59.437 --> 00:33:01.144
into a new range of thinking

881
00:33:01.144 --> 00:33:03.158
and realize there's something better that's coming

882
00:33:03.158 --> 00:33:04.416
for everybody.

883
00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:06.871
And they're actually involved

884
00:33:06.871 --> 00:33:10.251
in a gigantic transition

885
00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:11.382
for the entire world.

886
00:33:11.382 --> 00:33:15.603
Some people talk about this 2012 issue,

887
00:33:15.603 --> 00:33:16.939
and I talked about it today,

888
00:33:16.939 --> 00:33:19.208
and I wanted to address that on the radio

889
00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:21.165
with this particular gentleman

890
00:33:21.724 --> 00:33:22.955
who I work with,

891
00:33:22.955 --> 00:33:23.884
about that,

892
00:33:23.884 --> 00:33:24.902
'cause I knew you were coming

893
00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:28.590
and a lot of people on your network talk about that.

894
00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:32.065
The 2012 to me has already started.

895
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:35.934
The real transition is the introduction of the

896
00:33:35.934 --> 00:33:38.965
frictionless-based society,

897
00:33:38.965 --> 00:33:40.749
cold fusion.

898
00:33:40.749 --> 00:33:43.799
Perhaps the end of the calendar that they were talking about

899
00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:46.150
has to do with

900
00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:50.736
the new identity shift

901
00:33:50.736 --> 00:33:52.422
of humanity.

902
00:33:52.422 --> 00:33:53.804
<v ->Breaking away of the illusion.</v>

903
00:33:53.804 --> 00:33:55.953
<v ->Breaking away from the illusion.</v>

904
00:33:55.953 --> 00:33:58.352
I was interested and I understood what Apacalypto,

905
00:33:58.352 --> 00:34:00.255
when they made that movie and Mel Gibson directed,

906
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:04.433
the very end of it the Indian runs out to the ocean,

907
00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:06.561
and he's been in a very old tribe

908
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:08.128
of a different thinking modality.

909
00:34:08.128 --> 00:34:10.625
He goes out there and he sees the ship.

910
00:34:10.625 --> 00:34:12.201
That's like a UFO to him.

911
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:12.992
<v ->Right.</v>

912
00:34:12.992 --> 00:34:15.383
<v ->That's the shift that we're talking about.</v>

913
00:34:15.383 --> 00:34:17.121
That you seen it

914
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:19.641
and, (loud snapping) discovery,

915
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:21.677
transition happens.

916
00:34:21.677 --> 00:34:25.041
Why I'm saying is that cold fusion will do that,

917
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:29.166
it will change forever, banking, finance, value.

918
00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:30.060
Everything,

919
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.278
and it's coming.

920
00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:33.262
That and I asked questions

921
00:34:33.262 --> 00:34:34.946
and had people addressed questions to me,

922
00:34:34.946 --> 00:34:36.904
is it orchestrated?

923
00:34:36.905 --> 00:34:38.979
And I would tend to agree, yes.

924
00:34:38.979 --> 00:34:41.807
This global collapse is orchestrated.

925
00:34:43.258 --> 00:34:46.514
<v ->It certainly appears that there's some truth in that.</v>

926
00:34:46.514 --> 00:34:48.501
Now cold fusion, back to that for a moment,

927
00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:50.401
do you know which country that it's being?

928
00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:51.279
<v ->China.</v>

929
00:34:51.279 --> 00:34:52.367
<v ->That's what I heard.</v>

930
00:34:52.367 --> 00:34:55.459
Even though US has had cold fusion for 50, 60 years.

931
00:34:55.459 --> 00:34:57.011
But it's coming through China.

932
00:34:57.011 --> 00:35:00.791
<v ->Yeah, and there's reasons why</v>

933
00:35:00.791 --> 00:35:02.848
that culture,

934
00:35:02.848 --> 00:35:06.704
that base of people and that thinking,

935
00:35:07.093 --> 00:35:08.993
why they would get it

936
00:35:08.993 --> 00:35:11.147
versus a different country.

937
00:35:11.147 --> 00:35:14.134
Because every time you introduce a technology

938
00:35:14.134 --> 00:35:15.435
to an environment,

939
00:35:15.435 --> 00:35:16.960
there's gonna be major effects.

940
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.394
If I go down to the jungle

941
00:35:18.394 --> 00:35:20.815
and give them a buzzsaw,

942
00:35:20.815 --> 00:35:22.125
in the jungle,

943
00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.556
that will have some good effects

944
00:35:23.556 --> 00:35:24.781
and it'll have some bad effects.

945
00:35:24.781 --> 00:35:26.452
The bad effects are some guy could get that

946
00:35:26.452 --> 00:35:28.141
and cut everything down forever.

947
00:35:28.141 --> 00:35:31.265
Good effects are, maybe this guy makes more money.

948
00:35:31.265 --> 00:35:33.213
So we have to look at technology and what it does

949
00:35:33.213 --> 00:35:35.954
to the environment in many different ways,

950
00:35:35.954 --> 00:35:37.469
from many different angles,

951
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:38.998
so it's responsible.

952
00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:42.318
I think reason cold fusion has been held back

953
00:35:42.318 --> 00:35:44.770
is because they knew the digital environment was going

954
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.352
to implode on itself and the banking world,

955
00:35:47.352 --> 00:35:49.954
and we wanted to introduce a new technology

956
00:35:49.954 --> 00:35:52.515
that in sense bring us all together.

957
00:35:52.515 --> 00:35:56.443
I don't think that money

958
00:35:56.942 --> 00:35:59.281
in terms of our idea

959
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:02.918
that it's going to carry in stuff,

960
00:36:02.918 --> 00:36:05.341
our dollars, our little pieces of paper,

961
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:06.455
aren't gonna mean anything.

962
00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:08.468
And people don't really use that anyway,

963
00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:11.242
they all wanna feel safer with the card.

964
00:36:11.242 --> 00:36:12.511
<v ->Made to feel safer with cards.</v>

965
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:14.673
<v ->Yeah, that's not true exactly.</v>

966
00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:17.597
<v ->I'm just trying to get my mind around this a little bit.</v>

967
00:36:17.597 --> 00:36:21.237
Is it possible that the cold fusion card

968
00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:23.340
is sort of the ace in the hole

969
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.513
for the Chinese?

970
00:36:25.513 --> 00:36:29.271
As a result of floating this massive debt to this country.

971
00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:30.411
<v ->Yes.</v>

972
00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:32.237
<v ->For so long?</v>

973
00:36:32.766 --> 00:36:35.272
<v ->I haven't been giving the precise reasons,</v>

974
00:36:35.272 --> 00:36:37.831
but I know that

975
00:36:38.366 --> 00:36:41.602
that the powers that be have to be in the future.

976
00:36:41.602 --> 00:36:44.525
Because they have to be responsible for technology,

977
00:36:44.525 --> 00:36:46.797
'cause I understand what it does to humans

978
00:36:46.797 --> 00:36:48.852
and how we behave with each other.

979
00:36:48.852 --> 00:36:53.353
The Chinese have basically held up Wall Street

980
00:36:54.132 --> 00:36:55.666
for a long time.

981
00:36:56.472 --> 00:36:58.809
It's interesting to me that after they did their display

982
00:36:58.809 --> 00:37:00.270
at the Olympics,

983
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.860
the opening ceremonies

984
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.438
was like, hello?

985
00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:04.601
We're here.

986
00:37:04.601 --> 00:37:07.904
Everybody saw that and that was like, whoa.

987
00:37:08.135 --> 00:37:09.584
It was interesting that was happening

988
00:37:09.584 --> 00:37:11.087
and I would talk about it on the radio,

989
00:37:11.087 --> 00:37:13.765
we'd break during the opening ceremonies,

990
00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:15.784
Visa, it's everywhere you wanna be!

991
00:37:15.784 --> 00:37:17.265
All these credit card commercials on

992
00:37:17.265 --> 00:37:20.906
and they take the heroicism of these great athletes,

993
00:37:20.906 --> 00:37:22.614
have trained their entire life,

994
00:37:22.614 --> 00:37:25.084
they take the idea of this Visa, everywhere you wanna be,

995
00:37:25.084 --> 00:37:27.523
create a neuro-association between these Olympic champions.

996
00:37:27.523 --> 00:37:29.482
<v ->Sponsor them directly.
<v ->Sponsor them directly,</v>

997
00:37:29.482 --> 00:37:30.828
then create heroes,

998
00:37:30.828 --> 00:37:33.185
credit card user heroes out of the gold medalists,

999
00:37:33.185 --> 00:37:35.258
and they would do it immediately.

1000
00:37:35.258 --> 00:37:37.996
The commercial's produced and done, in the can,

1001
00:37:37.996 --> 00:37:39.546
so by the time person got the gold medal

1002
00:37:39.546 --> 00:37:40.693
they're already doing commercials

1003
00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:41.679
for the credit card companies.

1004
00:37:41.679 --> 00:37:43.987
<v ->Noticed that, that was amazing.</v>

1005
00:37:43.987 --> 00:37:46.347
<v ->We're going through a global meltdown.</v>

1006
00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:48.724
So people are asleep in the United States,

1007
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:51.536
they're still getting it on them all the time.

1008
00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:53.463
It was just like, this is crazy.

1009
00:37:53.463 --> 00:37:55.008
There's two different messages,

1010
00:37:55.008 --> 00:37:56.708
and then if you switch channels you got

1011
00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.626
Gerry Butler on CNN saying,

1012
00:37:58.626 --> 00:38:00.844
"You need to pay your bills off."

1013
00:38:00.844 --> 00:38:03.122
But then you got people saying don't use credit,

1014
00:38:03.122 --> 00:38:04.380
what's the message here?

1015
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.409
That's colliding ideas, all the time,

1016
00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:08.385
and chaos.

1017
00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:09.658
<v ->And chaos and confusion.</v>

1018
00:38:09.658 --> 00:38:12.506
It's worked, people are confused and there's a lot of chaos.

1019
00:38:12.506 --> 00:38:15.604
Now let's talk a little bit about,

1020
00:38:17.023 --> 00:38:19.251
say a person has come to you

1021
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:22.544
with same kind of troubles we were talking about earlier.

1022
00:38:23.694 --> 00:38:24.883
Just a couple of the tenants

1023
00:38:24.883 --> 00:38:26.706
'cause we're not going to have time to share the whole thing

1024
00:38:26.706 --> 00:38:28.072
that you actually do for them.

1025
00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:30.353
What do they have to be willing to confront

1026
00:38:30.353 --> 00:38:32.816
besides the personal illusory issue

1027
00:38:32.816 --> 00:38:34.799
of their identity with the card?

1028
00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:37.285
Beyond that in a practical sense

1029
00:38:37.285 --> 00:38:39.241
what's gonna happen to them?

1030
00:38:41.237 --> 00:38:44.450
<v ->First they have to go through the paradigm shift here.</v>

1031
00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:48.146
I am not a guy that takes on people twice.

1032
00:38:48.146 --> 00:38:49.426
I do it once.

1033
00:38:49.426 --> 00:38:51.330
I do the procedure, get 'em out of the alleged debt,

1034
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.357
the school loan, whatever unsecured loan that they have.

1035
00:38:54.357 --> 00:38:56.292
I explain that to them.

1036
00:38:57.751 --> 00:38:59.658
It's interesting because

1037
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.688
I interrupt their patterns.

1038
00:39:02.876 --> 00:39:05.199
Twice, in phone conversations,

1039
00:39:05.199 --> 00:39:08.725
and then I reinforce the interruption of those pattens

1040
00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:11.374
by having them listen to me on the radio.

1041
00:39:11.374 --> 00:39:13.361
Then what I tell them is

1042
00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:15.051
what you're going to have to do now is

1043
00:39:15.051 --> 00:39:18.224
you are going to have to face your old belief system,

1044
00:39:18.224 --> 00:39:20.451
everyday as you go through this process,

1045
00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:22.157
and the phone starts ringing,

1046
00:39:22.157 --> 00:39:23.848
start getting letters in the mail

1047
00:39:23.848 --> 00:39:27.079
of your old self believing things that aren't true.

1048
00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:28.743
Now are you gonna believe me,

1049
00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:30.249
or you gonna believe the letters that come through

1050
00:39:30.249 --> 00:39:31.587
every month?

1051
00:39:31.587 --> 00:39:33.713
All these triggers going off for old behaviors--

1052
00:39:33.713 --> 00:39:34.673
<v ->Lawsuits?</v>

1053
00:39:34.673 --> 00:39:35.582
<v ->Lawsuits.</v>

1054
00:39:35.582 --> 00:39:39.324
They have to expect the possibility of that coming to them.

1055
00:39:39.514 --> 00:39:42.016
If they understand what's really going on

1056
00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:43.786
and they understand the concept,

1057
00:39:43.786 --> 00:39:45.291
they're not afraid of the court.

1058
00:39:45.291 --> 00:39:47.744
In most cases, my clients never deal with the court

1059
00:39:47.744 --> 00:39:49.046
in the first place.

1060
00:39:49.046 --> 00:39:52.268
It's not something they have to deal with

1061
00:39:52.268 --> 00:39:54.532
hands on, ever.

1062
00:39:54.816 --> 00:39:56.395
That was a big problem in the beginning,

1063
00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:58.123
is because a lot of people

1064
00:39:58.123 --> 00:40:01.012
wouldn't deal with these alleged debts,

1065
00:40:01.012 --> 00:40:02.794
and deal with administratively 'cause they're too afraid

1066
00:40:02.794 --> 00:40:04.148
of the courts.

1067
00:40:04.328 --> 00:40:07.406
And I proved to them and I proven on the radio

1068
00:40:07.406 --> 00:40:10.575
that the procedure for collecting on alleged debts

1069
00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:12.638
is a procedure, it follows a certain sequence.

1070
00:40:12.638 --> 00:40:14.536
Certain banks do certain things depending upon

1071
00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:16.012
how much you have,

1072
00:40:16.261 --> 00:40:18.000
what state you live in,

1073
00:40:18.221 --> 00:40:19.404
if they're gonna arbitrate on you,

1074
00:40:19.404 --> 00:40:20.735
if they're gonna sue on you.

1075
00:40:20.735 --> 00:40:22.504
The collection process, the whole thing follows--

1076
00:40:22.504 --> 00:40:24.928
<v ->Who are most aggressive banks?</v>

1077
00:40:24.928 --> 00:40:26.585
<v ->Most aggressive banks are Citibank,</v>

1078
00:40:26.585 --> 00:40:28.165
without a doubt,

1079
00:40:28.165 --> 00:40:29.657
absolutely,

1080
00:40:29.657 --> 00:40:32.377
reptile, devil, evil,

1081
00:40:32.377 --> 00:40:34.489
there's nothing good there, at all.

1082
00:40:34.489 --> 00:40:35.908
(laughing)
I've got people calling in

1083
00:40:35.908 --> 00:40:38.249
from all over the place that hate those guys.

1084
00:40:38.249 --> 00:40:39.998
I never will deal with them.

1085
00:40:39.998 --> 00:40:42.313
Second after that, is Discover.

1086
00:40:42.313 --> 00:40:44.629
Third after that used to be MBNA.

1087
00:40:44.629 --> 00:40:46.613
Fourth after that, American Express.

1088
00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:48.266
And then after that it falls with Fleet,

1089
00:40:48.266 --> 00:40:50.644
Wells Fargo, Capital One, all those cards.

1090
00:40:50.644 --> 00:40:51.508
<v ->Where's Chase?</v>

1091
00:40:51.508 --> 00:40:53.852
<v ->Chase is kind of in the middle.</v>

1092
00:40:55.231 --> 00:40:57.897
None of 'em follow the laws, at all.

1093
00:40:57.897 --> 00:41:00.197
It's not just me saying that it's all over the web,

1094
00:41:00.197 --> 00:41:01.531
people have made it in documentaries,

1095
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:02.684
it's very common knowledge.

1096
00:41:02.684 --> 00:41:03.755
They don't follow procedure,

1097
00:41:03.755 --> 00:41:07.626
they're not customer friendly at all.

1098
00:41:08.286 --> 00:41:11.003
Plenty of documentation to indicate that.

1099
00:41:11.003 --> 00:41:12.433
They

1100
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.842
have people get on the phone,

1101
00:41:16.842 --> 00:41:20.060
not in writing, they always go with the phone first,

1102
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.759
and they illicit responses of the people on the

1103
00:41:22.759 --> 00:41:24.800
opposing end of the phone to determine,

1104
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.123
how much they've got,

1105
00:41:26.123 --> 00:41:27.766
how scared they are,

1106
00:41:27.766 --> 00:41:29.291
what they're gonna do,

1107
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:30.773
if they're working,

1108
00:41:30.773 --> 00:41:33.372
and if they're a good person to sue.

1109
00:41:34.193 --> 00:41:37.164
That's done on purpose to determine whether or not

1110
00:41:37.164 --> 00:41:40.837
me being the person that's carrying this alleged debt

1111
00:41:40.837 --> 00:41:42.552
and now who's bought for pennies on the dollar

1112
00:41:42.552 --> 00:41:44.480
is coming after you for the entire amount,

1113
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.512
plus interest, plus penalties, (tongue floundering) forever.

1114
00:41:47.512 --> 00:41:48.634
All that crap.

1115
00:41:48.634 --> 00:41:51.268
You've got to determine

1116
00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:53.391
what's gonna happen next with them.

1117
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:55.549
And I tell them everything.

1118
00:41:55.549 --> 00:41:57.940
Full disclosure on the whole issue,

1119
00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.322
and then what can happen if,

1120
00:42:00.508 --> 00:42:04.134
some credit card agreements tell you

1121
00:42:04.134 --> 00:42:06.509
that you do not have any rights and you're gonna arbitrate,

1122
00:42:06.509 --> 00:42:08.948
and you're not gonna go to any courts at all.

1123
00:42:09.282 --> 00:42:12.155
Just impossible, undefinable,

1124
00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:14.031
nobody can understand these credit card agreements

1125
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:14.703
at all.

1126
00:42:14.703 --> 00:42:17.304
I've called people, asked people to come on the air,

1127
00:42:17.304 --> 00:42:19.758
please, can anybody please explain it to me?

1128
00:42:19.758 --> 00:42:21.059
Nobody can explain it.

1129
00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:23.628
How is a person supposed to explain in court?

1130
00:42:23.628 --> 00:42:26.379
So I give them all this information

1131
00:42:26.379 --> 00:42:30.303
and tell them how the banks move in on you

1132
00:42:30.303 --> 00:42:32.715
and what the procedure's gonna be and how it's done.

1133
00:42:32.715 --> 00:42:35.979
Because I've seen court cases all over the US,

1134
00:42:35.979 --> 00:42:37.483
I know what the judges do,

1135
00:42:37.483 --> 00:42:39.593
I know what the law firms do,

1136
00:42:39.593 --> 00:42:41.321
which law firm's the most prevalent,

1137
00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:44.208
which ones represent these alleged debts.

1138
00:42:44.843 --> 00:42:46.758
They all work in union

1139
00:42:46.758 --> 00:42:49.758
with the credit reporting agencies,

1140
00:42:49.758 --> 00:42:51.738
with the bank itself.

1141
00:42:51.738 --> 00:42:54.157
You got the credit reporting agencies, you got the bank,

1142
00:42:54.157 --> 00:42:55.759
you got the collection agencies,

1143
00:42:55.759 --> 00:42:59.970
and then you have all the media environments

1144
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.004
making you do more.

1145
00:43:02.004 --> 00:43:03.673
Making it worse.

1146
00:43:03.673 --> 00:43:06.856
So it's just crazy what's happened

1147
00:43:06.856 --> 00:43:09.194
when people get themselves in these conditions.

1148
00:43:09.194 --> 00:43:13.098
But the aggressiveness of the courts.

1149
00:43:13.098 --> 00:43:16.899
Now I know that any client that I've dealt with

1150
00:43:16.899 --> 00:43:19.522
that's gone to court and represented themself

1151
00:43:19.522 --> 00:43:22.432
by education that they've received,

1152
00:43:22.432 --> 00:43:23.972
we've told them,

1153
00:43:24.193 --> 00:43:26.323
there is no silver bullet in this.

1154
00:43:26.323 --> 00:43:28.558
Sometimes you may lose.

1155
00:43:28.558 --> 00:43:29.878
But

1156
00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:34.007
did you really expect a judge who's going to say

1157
00:43:34.007 --> 00:43:36.256
the bank didn't loan you any money?

1158
00:43:36.256 --> 00:43:38.058
That's not how the cases were won.

1159
00:43:38.058 --> 00:43:39.925
The money creation issue has never gone up

1160
00:43:39.925 --> 00:43:41.087
into the higher courts,

1161
00:43:41.087 --> 00:43:42.355
they've been shut down.

1162
00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:45.748
I was lucky enough to see, historically, over time,

1163
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:49.140
what the courts did and how they're just jammed

1164
00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.292
with these credit card cases from all over the country.

1165
00:43:52.292 --> 00:43:54.788
And I had 80-year-old ladies go against Citibank

1166
00:43:54.788 --> 00:43:55.908
and beat 'em.

1167
00:43:55.908 --> 00:44:00.186
I've had young students beat other banks,

1168
00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:03.349
but it required a lot of courage,

1169
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:05.908
and it required them learning something new

1170
00:44:05.908 --> 00:44:07.455
and changing their identity.

1171
00:44:07.455 --> 00:44:09.572
Big paradigm shift for people to get out of this,

1172
00:44:09.572 --> 00:44:10.742
but I say, look,

1173
00:44:10.742 --> 00:44:11.972
then pay it off.
<v ->It's not easy.</v>

1174
00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:12.943
<v ->Pay it off then.</v>

1175
00:44:12.943 --> 00:44:13.971
Do it that way.

1176
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:15.642
I'd say you can do it this way, you can do it that way,

1177
00:44:15.642 --> 00:44:17.075
but do you really wanna pay on that

1178
00:44:17.075 --> 00:44:18.376
for the rest of your life?

1179
00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:19.215
<v ->Right.</v>

1180
00:44:19.215 --> 00:44:21.489
So either way, you have to pay the piper.

1181
00:44:21.489 --> 00:44:22.970
It's not an easy thing to do

1182
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.653
but it's not only doable, you've done it a lot.

1183
00:44:25.653 --> 00:44:26.796
<v ->It's easier now.</v>

1184
00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:29.494
I've done it many different ways, I've done it.

1185
00:44:29.494 --> 00:44:31.766
I've done it by using the laws against them,

1186
00:44:31.766 --> 00:44:34.262
I've done it by having somebody else handle

1187
00:44:34.262 --> 00:44:36.058
the alleged debt,

1188
00:44:36.058 --> 00:44:40.294
I've done it by, go read A, and B, and begin.

1189
00:44:40.294 --> 00:44:42.740
I've done it many different ways to help people

1190
00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.576
but it's always

1191
00:44:45.908 --> 00:44:49.240
a person has to put a little bit of

1192
00:44:50.206 --> 00:44:51.248
inertia into it.

1193
00:44:51.248 --> 00:44:52.357
<v ->You have to have courage.</v>

1194
00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:54.058
<v ->You gotta be able to go for it a little bit.</v>

1195
00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.238
For some people they've been so, like.

1196
00:44:56.238 --> 00:44:58.236
For women, most of them are like,

1197
00:44:58.236 --> 00:44:59.544
"Well, I donno if I should do it."

1198
00:44:59.544 --> 00:45:00.814
It's only when they're backed up,

1199
00:45:00.814 --> 00:45:02.311
right against the very back

1200
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:04.082
and they got nothing else to do, and this is it.

1201
00:45:04.082 --> 00:45:05.783
Then they do it.

1202
00:45:05.983 --> 00:45:07.930
Some people call me and they talk to me,

1203
00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:09.034
give 'em the whole scoop

1204
00:45:09.034 --> 00:45:10.770
and then I don't hear from 'em for seven months.

1205
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.511
<v ->What do you tell someone right now who's starting</v>

1206
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:14.218
to feel the squeeze already?

1207
00:45:14.218 --> 00:45:16.148
They know they're gonna begin falling behind

1208
00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:18.468
on their payments on their new Hummer.

1209
00:45:18.468 --> 00:45:19.871
<v ->Find me.</v>

1210
00:45:19.871 --> 00:45:20.944
Find me.

1211
00:45:20.944 --> 00:45:23.397
I will tell you exactly what your choices are,

1212
00:45:23.397 --> 00:45:26.887
and that the Hummer that you thought--

1213
00:45:26.887 --> 00:45:28.800
<v ->Can you just say, oh please, Mr. Hummer seller,</v>

1214
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.398
take your Hummer. (laughs)

1215
00:45:30.398 --> 00:45:32.575
<v ->I'd just totally reframe that and said,</v>

1216
00:45:32.575 --> 00:45:35.159
these feelings that you have with that Hummer?

1217
00:45:35.387 --> 00:45:37.153
They're just feelings.
(giggling)

1218
00:45:38.107 --> 00:45:39.045
You'll have them for a little while

1219
00:45:39.045 --> 00:45:39.995
and then you'll get over it,

1220
00:45:39.995 --> 00:45:41.701
and then you'll just be driving like another car

1221
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:42.725
you did before.

1222
00:45:42.725 --> 00:45:43.868
Then it'll be no big deal.

1223
00:45:43.868 --> 00:45:45.057
But right now--

1224
00:45:45.057 --> 00:45:48.482
<v ->Does repossession a good position to let them fall into?</v>

1225
00:45:48.482 --> 00:45:49.876
<v ->I've had people come in to me</v>

1226
00:45:49.876 --> 00:45:51.263
with those particular situations,

1227
00:45:51.263 --> 00:45:53.736
and some of them have said they've given it back,

1228
00:45:53.736 --> 00:45:55.152
or whatever, and lost it.

1229
00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:57.851
I've had worst-case scenarios come to me.

1230
00:45:57.851 --> 00:45:59.476
<v ->'Cause I been thinking a lot of people are probably</v>

1231
00:45:59.476 --> 00:46:01.336
gonna be faced with them down the road,

1232
00:46:01.336 --> 00:46:03.274
losing their automobiles and everything else.

1233
00:46:03.274 --> 00:46:05.519
<v ->Lose their house, lose their car,</v>

1234
00:46:05.519 --> 00:46:07.957
had the Katrina victims came to me.

1235
00:46:07.957 --> 00:46:09.988
They weren't helped out by the banks or at all.

1236
00:46:09.988 --> 00:46:10.737
Nothing.

1237
00:46:10.737 --> 00:46:12.198
They didn't get help from anybody.

1238
00:46:12.198 --> 00:46:14.150
Everybody got smashed in that.
<v ->Disgusting.</v>

1239
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.777
<v ->So they lost their home, the lost everything,</v>

1240
00:46:15.777 --> 00:46:17.099
I had those people.

1241
00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:20.841
I've had people that were getting sued,

1242
00:46:20.841 --> 00:46:22.112
now this is interesting,

1243
00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:24.416
they were getting sued on debts that were

1244
00:46:24.416 --> 00:46:26.974
way past the statute of limitations to collect on,

1245
00:46:26.974 --> 00:46:28.181
but they didn't know it.

1246
00:46:28.181 --> 00:46:29.887
See the collection agencies and law firms

1247
00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.530
they expect you to be a moron.

1248
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:32.810
They want you to be a moron.

1249
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:34.783
They need you to be a moron.

1250
00:46:34.783 --> 00:46:37.096
But if you're up-to-date on what's going on

1251
00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:39.294
and you realize that you can't sue when something's

1252
00:46:39.294 --> 00:46:41.428
beyond the statute of limitations,

1253
00:46:41.995 --> 00:46:44.491
they get over it a lot easier.

1254
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:46.499
It's mostly education.

1255
00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:48.063
Another thing that was happening behind the scenes,

1256
00:46:48.063 --> 00:46:49.482
'cause I knew we're in trouble when

1257
00:46:49.482 --> 00:46:52.291
people were getting sued on people that were dead.

1258
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:53.140
<v ->Right.</v>

1259
00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.380
<v ->Guy calls me from New York,</v>

1260
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.809
I'm on the air with him and he's telling me,

1261
00:46:57.511 --> 00:47:01.060
"I got this amount of debt and I'm being sued by Citibank

1262
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.440
on my Dad's $2,300 credit card debt,

1263
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.647
and he's been dead three years ago."

1264
00:47:06.647 --> 00:47:08.210
And I'm like,

1265
00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:11.912
what in the world is going on?

1266
00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:13.059
That is crazy.

1267
00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:14.641
It's over.

1268
00:47:15.088 --> 00:47:17.812
It's not your responsibility.
<v ->After death.</v>

1269
00:47:17.982 --> 00:47:19.633
<v ->The guy's dead and they're still suing,</v>

1270
00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:21.244
and that's all over the place.

1271
00:47:21.244 --> 00:47:22.607
<v ->Yes, I've heard of that.</v>

1272
00:47:22.607 --> 00:47:23.918
<v ->What is that? That's not fair.</v>

1273
00:47:23.921 --> 00:47:25.192
<v ->So what happens with,</v>

1274
00:47:25.192 --> 00:47:27.185
there are a lot of these people on billboards,

1275
00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:30.288
and on late night TV ads and such,

1276
00:47:30.288 --> 00:47:31.892
"Let us take care of your debt."

1277
00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:33.340
And I know a couple people who've tried that

1278
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.216
and been ripped, and it didn't do a thing.

1279
00:47:35.216 --> 00:47:36.169
What are they doing?

1280
00:47:36.169 --> 00:47:36.990
What's going on?

1281
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.837
This is a tricky field.
<v ->This is why most people</v>

1282
00:47:38.837 --> 00:47:42.223
in the outside world of debt consolidation,

1283
00:47:42.223 --> 00:47:44.017
settlement,

1284
00:47:45.286 --> 00:47:47.313
Consumer Credit Counseling,

1285
00:47:47.313 --> 00:47:48.272
bankruptcy,

1286
00:47:48.272 --> 00:47:49.786
those are the choices, generally.

1287
00:47:49.786 --> 00:47:51.539
Bankruptcy you can't do on credit cards anymore,

1288
00:47:51.539 --> 00:47:53.761
and it's not really bankruptcy in the terms of credit cards

1289
00:47:53.761 --> 00:47:54.743
who doesn't work,

1290
00:47:54.743 --> 00:47:58.177
thanks to Bush, and MBNA, they got that law passed,

1291
00:47:58.177 --> 00:47:59.562
so that we couldn't do anything.

1292
00:47:59.562 --> 00:48:01.077
Then you have Consumer Credit Counseling

1293
00:48:01.077 --> 00:48:02.623
what's basically

1294
00:48:03.487 --> 00:48:06.453
they negotiate the amounts of these alleged debts,

1295
00:48:06.453 --> 00:48:08.106
then go into your personal life,

1296
00:48:08.106 --> 00:48:10.154
find out every penny that you have,

1297
00:48:10.154 --> 00:48:12.309
what your behavior is, everything about you.

1298
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:14.750
And they see to it that you pay them every month,

1299
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.150
and they make sure that the creditors know that

1300
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:18.793
you're gonna be paying for the next 50 years

1301
00:48:18.793 --> 00:48:20.040
on these things.

1302
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.662
Then you have settlements,

1303
00:48:21.662 --> 00:48:22.974
which aren't very good either because

1304
00:48:22.974 --> 00:48:24.873
people that done settlements have gotten sued

1305
00:48:24.873 --> 00:48:26.451
for the remaining balance on the settlements

1306
00:48:26.451 --> 00:48:27.880
that they agreed to

1307
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.030
on credit cards.

1308
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.710
<v ->Like on of those calls that comes in where they say,</v>

1309
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.060
"Look, we're gonna make you a deal."

1310
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.222
What's classic?

1311
00:48:34.222 --> 00:48:35.469
What would that phone call be like,

1312
00:48:35.469 --> 00:48:37.241
from the credit card company?

1313
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:39.040
Someone's behind two months.
<v ->Hey, you owe 15 grand,</v>

1314
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.543
we got a great deal for ya,

1315
00:48:40.543 --> 00:48:42.278
pay 70% right now,

1316
00:48:42.278 --> 00:48:43.816
it's over.

1317
00:48:44.325 --> 00:48:45.403
Big mistake.

1318
00:48:45.403 --> 00:48:46.655
<v ->And people say, oh okay.</v>

1319
00:48:46.655 --> 00:48:49.336
<v ->And most people don't have 70% to even pay</v>

1320
00:48:49.336 --> 00:48:51.484
in the first place, so it's not a deal in the first place.

1321
00:48:51.484 --> 00:48:53.436
Second of all, when you settle it,

1322
00:48:53.436 --> 00:48:56.220
you're admitting that the debt was there.

1323
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.736
And when you get a report in your credit report,

1324
00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:00.646
it's supposed to say settled as agreed

1325
00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:03.174
but often time it does not reflect that at all.

1326
00:49:03.174 --> 00:49:06.268
If you do settlements you have to be really careful

1327
00:49:06.268 --> 00:49:07.878
when you do them.

1328
00:49:09.047 --> 00:49:12.074
I've had people that come to me, students,

1329
00:49:12.973 --> 00:49:15.886
I tell them to settle it 'cause it's like $2, $3,000.

1330
00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:18.319
I said, don't panic, this is what you need to do,

1331
00:49:18.319 --> 00:49:20.452
but if you settle it, do it very well

1332
00:49:20.452 --> 00:49:22.260
because I've had people go and settle on these

1333
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.281
alleged debt,

1334
00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:25.274
and they get sued for the remaining balance.

1335
00:49:25.274 --> 00:49:28.231
Some people settle on $15,000 alleged credit card debt

1336
00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:31.452
they settle ten, then they get sued on the rest of it.

1337
00:49:31.452 --> 00:49:32.486
Is that right?

1338
00:49:32.486 --> 00:49:34.043
They had agreements, that it was over.

1339
00:49:34.043 --> 00:49:35.952
That was happening all over the place, too,

1340
00:49:35.952 --> 00:49:38.357
so I don't tell them to settle either.

1341
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.110
The options for people out there are not very good.

1342
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.862
<v ->And are there some that are just ripping people off,</v>

1343
00:49:41.862 --> 00:49:43.967
saying yeah, give us a little money, we'll take care of it?

1344
00:49:43.967 --> 00:49:45.355
And then they don't.
<v ->Right.</v>

1345
00:49:45.355 --> 00:49:46.963
There's a lot of companies out there

1346
00:49:46.963 --> 00:49:49.758
that don't explain the entire thing,

1347
00:49:49.758 --> 00:49:52.698
and they do not perform right.

1348
00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:56.328
I tell people all the problematic issues that will occur,

1349
00:49:56.328 --> 00:49:58.222
there is not silver bullet in this,

1350
00:49:58.222 --> 00:50:00.409
and that you have to understand and be responsible

1351
00:50:00.409 --> 00:50:02.442
at the end of the day for it.

1352
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:06.062
Just because I have a track record with my clients

1353
00:50:06.062 --> 00:50:07.576
for a certain amount of time does not mean

1354
00:50:07.576 --> 00:50:09.261
there's not been complaints, there has been.

1355
00:50:09.261 --> 00:50:11.300
There's always been complaints when people

1356
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.690
have dealt with me or a company I've dealt with,

1357
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:14.916
getting rid of these things.

1358
00:50:14.916 --> 00:50:16.441
Because most of the time when people come to me

1359
00:50:16.441 --> 00:50:17.476
they can't read, they can't write,

1360
00:50:17.476 --> 00:50:19.729
they don't follow procedure correctly,

1361
00:50:19.729 --> 00:50:21.651
they didn't hear what I told them in the beginning

1362
00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.763
and said, these are the things that can happen.

1363
00:50:23.763 --> 00:50:25.090
And I told people in the beginning,

1364
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.006
I said if you're concerned about this,

1365
00:50:27.006 --> 00:50:28.435
you have assets,

1366
00:50:28.435 --> 00:50:30.717
before you begin this, you can do this.

1367
00:50:30.717 --> 00:50:32.786
So if you do get sued, you have a judgment on you,

1368
00:50:32.786 --> 00:50:34.344
they're not gonna get anything anyway.

1369
00:50:34.344 --> 00:50:35.770
So I went through all that stuff,

1370
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.583
so I made sure that if people came to me,

1371
00:50:37.583 --> 00:50:39.652
they had all the options before them,

1372
00:50:39.652 --> 00:50:42.579
they were given all the possible things that occur.

1373
00:50:42.579 --> 00:50:44.050
And there's a lot of companies out there

1374
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:45.288
that don't come through,

1375
00:50:45.288 --> 00:50:47.944
they take people's money and nothing happens,

1376
00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.383
or it doesn't turn out right,

1377
00:50:49.383 --> 00:50:51.807
and there's loads of them.

1378
00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:56.089
People are using very sophisticated legal paperwork

1379
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:57.514
that has gotten them into trouble

1380
00:50:57.514 --> 00:50:59.157
'cause they don't know how to use it.

1381
00:50:59.157 --> 00:51:00.458
I won't talk about what this is

1382
00:51:00.458 --> 00:51:04.021
but a lot of people that were trying to play tricks

1383
00:51:04.021 --> 00:51:06.169
with the banks, paperwork-wise,

1384
00:51:06.169 --> 00:51:07.873
went to jail.

1385
00:51:08.408 --> 00:51:12.251
They got questioned by the Federal Bureau Investigation,

1386
00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:14.108
FBI came to them.

1387
00:51:14.512 --> 00:51:16.242
The Justice Department came to them.

1388
00:51:16.242 --> 00:51:18.857
I even spoke with the Justice Department myself

1389
00:51:18.857 --> 00:51:21.191
about that type of paperwork.

1390
00:51:21.191 --> 00:51:23.665
What I do is I tell them

1391
00:51:23.665 --> 00:51:25.542
we're gonna use the laws in place,

1392
00:51:25.542 --> 00:51:27.248
which you can look at yourself,

1393
00:51:27.248 --> 00:51:29.981
and we're gonna use it on the company themselves.

1394
00:51:29.981 --> 00:51:30.982
<v ->Right.</v>

1395
00:51:30.982 --> 00:51:32.967
<v ->So that the company you have</v>

1396
00:51:32.967 --> 00:51:34.839
supposedly a contract agreement with,

1397
00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:36.545
they have to perform, too.

1398
00:51:36.545 --> 00:51:39.506
So we use the laws in place so they understand them,

1399
00:51:39.506 --> 00:51:41.636
so there's no razzle-dazzle

1400
00:51:41.636 --> 00:51:44.226
legal magic going on.

1401
00:51:44.226 --> 00:51:45.668
So they understand up front.

1402
00:51:45.668 --> 00:51:48.410
Because I understand that when people come to me

1403
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.138
it's a last-ditch effort,

1404
00:51:50.138 --> 00:51:52.658
and I wanna blow their whole

1405
00:51:53.041 --> 00:51:55.393
feeling that there's nothing that can be done.

1406
00:51:55.393 --> 00:51:56.647
So I'm very careful.

1407
00:51:56.647 --> 00:51:59.901
<v ->So once this happens, once a person is clear,</v>

1408
00:52:00.155 --> 00:52:02.608
we can see what happens to their lives then.

1409
00:52:02.608 --> 00:52:05.974
Credit ratings is not gonna matter in the future anyway.

1410
00:52:06.496 --> 00:52:09.291
What do you see as the silver lining to the crumbling

1411
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:13.638
of this old structure of credit, banking, everything?

1412
00:52:13.638 --> 00:52:16.123
<v ->The silver lining is</v>

1413
00:52:18.205 --> 00:52:21.516
our identity and how we relate to money,

1414
00:52:21.516 --> 00:52:24.075
and our value of ourselves

1415
00:52:24.075 --> 00:52:25.153
and our neighbors,

1416
00:52:25.153 --> 00:52:27.307
it's going to change forever.

1417
00:52:27.307 --> 00:52:28.821
Forever.

1418
00:52:28.991 --> 00:52:30.992
You may not see it tomorrow or the next day,

1419
00:52:30.992 --> 00:52:33.041
but when cold fusion comes out

1420
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:35.212
and other technologies come out,

1421
00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:38.502
the idea of what wealth was or is

1422
00:52:38.502 --> 00:52:40.412
will be forever changed.

1423
00:52:40.412 --> 00:52:42.634
This was

1424
00:52:43.952 --> 00:52:45.263
incredible today,

1425
00:52:45.263 --> 00:52:47.706
is an amazing time in history

1426
00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:50.084
because our whole idea of a value,

1427
00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:52.089
and the economic global meltdown

1428
00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:53.785
of everybody panicking and all the banks

1429
00:52:53.785 --> 00:52:55.246
closing down all over the place.

1430
00:52:55.256 --> 00:52:57.149
Has never happened before like this.

1431
00:52:57.149 --> 00:52:59.954
So all of us are participating in it,

1432
00:52:59.954 --> 00:53:04.060
and actually there's some great things to look forward to.

1433
00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:07.147
If you wanna make it really hard,

1434
00:53:07.147 --> 00:53:09.478
you can do what

1435
00:53:10.199 --> 00:53:11.749
Ron Paul is doing.

1436
00:53:11.749 --> 00:53:13.548
Now I agree with a lot of his things,

1437
00:53:13.548 --> 00:53:16.801
but he's holding on to a past environment

1438
00:53:16.801 --> 00:53:18.731
that's never gonna come back again,

1439
00:53:18.731 --> 00:53:20.768
'cause he's not including the effects

1440
00:53:20.768 --> 00:53:23.279
of the digital environment on his ideas.

1441
00:53:23.279 --> 00:53:25.188
When I was on the air I was talking about that,

1442
00:53:25.188 --> 00:53:27.060
and addressing that, I never spoke to him personally.

1443
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.215
I was saying, you need to address that in your campaign,

1444
00:53:29.215 --> 00:53:32.653
and talk about that because that stuff's never gonna change.

1445
00:53:32.896 --> 00:53:36.322
You have a whole class of people behind you

1446
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:40.139
that don't realize a lot of their ideas are obsolete now.

1447
00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:41.646
That aren't gonna matter.

1448
00:53:41.646 --> 00:53:43.698
So the silver lining

1449
00:53:43.698 --> 00:53:47.110
is there's good things look forward to.

1450
00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:48.281
We're gonna have to go through a lot

1451
00:53:48.281 --> 00:53:50.090
of problematic change 'cause,

1452
00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.446
you tell somebody to quit smoking,

1453
00:53:52.658 --> 00:53:54.589
that they've been doing it for a long time.

1454
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:56.622
They got to work out their problems,

1455
00:53:56.622 --> 00:53:58.125
and they make it very difficult.

1456
00:53:58.125 --> 00:54:00.505
and change for people in terms of money

1457
00:54:00.505 --> 00:54:02.365
that's a big deal.

1458
00:54:02.365 --> 00:54:04.670
It's not gonna be easy for people

1459
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:09.245
unless they go through major behavior modification.

1460
00:54:09.616 --> 00:54:10.918
They're gonna have to do it on their own

1461
00:54:10.918 --> 00:54:12.360
because I'm not gonna get much cooperation

1462
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.163
from mainstream media.

1463
00:54:14.163 --> 00:54:15.638
<v ->Nor anybody else, for that matter.</v>

1464
00:54:15.638 --> 00:54:18.027
It really is an internal journey of true values.

1465
00:54:18.027 --> 00:54:19.235
<v ->Yes.</v>

1466
00:54:20.435 --> 00:54:23.029
I would say, look, if you wanna go for it,

1467
00:54:23.029 --> 00:54:24.532
go on a media fast,

1468
00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:25.728
get out of the environment,

1469
00:54:25.728 --> 00:54:27.295
shut off all your electronic devices,

1470
00:54:27.295 --> 00:54:28.651
get away from the TV.

1471
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:30.709
Everything, for like two weeks,

1472
00:54:30.709 --> 00:54:33.002
and rethink about who you are,

1473
00:54:33.002 --> 00:54:34.500
how you relate to money,

1474
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.823
and where you're going.

1475
00:54:35.823 --> 00:54:38.649
And then when it's time, you've got that

1476
00:54:38.649 --> 00:54:40.718
in a group dynamic with a bunch of people,

1477
00:54:40.718 --> 00:54:42.265
'cause it's easier done in a group dynamic

1478
00:54:42.265 --> 00:54:44.377
forming new belief systems.

1479
00:54:44.377 --> 00:54:46.659
You go back into the matrix, so to speak,

1480
00:54:46.659 --> 00:54:47.961
you wire back in,

1481
00:54:47.961 --> 00:54:50.254
and you have to be aware of your awareness

1482
00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:52.935
as your participating in the electronic environment.

1483
00:54:52.935 --> 00:54:54.982
So you have to have a whole new level of awareness

1484
00:54:54.982 --> 00:54:57.030
and understanding if you're going to survive,

1485
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.821
as we go through this big transition.

1486
00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:01.338
You have to do things differently now, period.

1487
00:55:01.338 --> 00:55:02.949
Doesn't matter.

1488
00:55:04.014 --> 00:55:06.370
It's a scary time, but it's an exciting time,

1489
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.519
all at the same time.
<v ->I would agree.</v>

1490
00:55:09.719 --> 00:55:11.109
<v ->There's a lot to look forward to</v>

1491
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:15.204
and I don't think that many people right now

1492
00:55:15.773 --> 00:55:16.831
see that yet.

1493
00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:17.892
But they will.

1494
00:55:17.892 --> 00:55:19.330
<v ->Yeah.
<v ->They will.</v>

1495
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.759
<v ->To listen to James' programs just go to achieveradio.com,</v>

1496
00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:29.159
the information on his show is free to everyone.

1497
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.706
He does charge a fee however,

1498
00:55:30.706 --> 00:55:32.636
for his personal consultations.

1499
00:55:32.636 --> 00:55:35.004
Our primary purpose in bringing you this information

1500
00:55:35.004 --> 00:55:37.555
is to let you know that you're not powerless

1501
00:55:37.555 --> 00:55:40.204
just because your finances are looking dreary.

1502
00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:41.303
Until next time,

1503
00:55:41.303 --> 00:55:43.701
thanks for watching CMN.

1504
